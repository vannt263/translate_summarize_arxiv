    "the last few years have seen the emergence of an observationally consistent cosmological model based on firm physical ideas . the hot big bang model of the expanding universe , whose structure and dynamics can be described by general relativity ( gr ) , has a number of cosmological parameters that are now well constrained by numerous observations .",
    "wmap measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , supernova measurements @xcite , and measurements of large scale structure @xcite among others , have settled on a concordance model of a spatially flat universe with matter density about 25% of critical .",
    "this concordance model is consistent with the ages of the oldest stars @xcite , hubble parameter measurements @xcite , and primordial abundances of light elements from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "one of the main requirements of a successful cosmological model is that it connect measurements of the early universe , e.g. the cmb and bbn , to the measurements of the local universe of galaxies and stars .",
    "the large scale structure of galaxies that we observe in galaxy surveys must have formed through gravitational collapse of the small fluctuations left over from that earlier time .",
    "the properties of these large - scale mass densities can be predicted from the initial conditions as observed in the cmb combined with our understanding of gravity as described by general relativity .",
    "however , since the universe in our model is dominated by dark matter , we need to make the connection between the distribution of galaxies relative to the dark matter if we want to compare these observed structures to what is predicted .",
    "the relation between the galaxy density and the dark matter density is known as the _ bias_. for the concordance model to be in agreement with the data on galaxy clustering , it is required that on large scales the bias parameter ( which we will define shortly ) is close to one . on smaller scales",
    "the bias must be different from one but of order unity .",
    "moreover , the relative bias of different galaxy types is known to depend on spectral type and luminosity .",
    "one can do better than simply treating the bias as a free parameter .",
    "galaxy biasing is after all closely linked to the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "although galaxy formation is not completely understood , it is becoming increasingly amenable to theoretical modeling and numerical simulation .",
    "gas dynamical n - body simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite each predict how galaxies are biased with respect to mass .",
    "nevertheless , sufficient uncertainty on the details of galaxy formation remain that observational constraints on the bias are needed .",
    "the apparent complexity of the bias has motivated the development of new probes of large - scale structure and bias that do not rely on luminous galaxies as tracers of the underlying mass .",
    "gravitational lensing is a prime example .",
    "lensing is ideally suited to studying dark matter since it is directly sensitive to the total mass density along the line of sight .",
    "other probes of dark matter such as dynamical measurements must rely on some assumptions such as that a system has reached dynamical equilibrium . by contrast , lensing provides a clean probe of the dark matter .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing ( ggl ) , in particular , probes the dark matter density profile around luminous galaxies . in galaxy - galaxy lensing ,",
    "one measures the mean tangential distortion of a large number of source galaxies behind foreground lens galaxies by stacking the signal from the latter @xcite . to date",
    ", lensing measurements and theory have focused on the two - point galaxy - mass correlation function ( 2pcf ) .",
    "this correlation function can be measured from galaxy photometric surveys and compared to the results of n - body dark matter simulations .",
    "these measurements provide direct constraints on bias models .",
    "although they do not measure the galaxy bias parameter , @xmath0 , directly , they do measure a closely related quantity and so these measurements do test the bias model .    while the 2pcf is the lowest order measurement of how much a distribution is clustered",
    ", it does not carry complete statistical information about a non - gaussian distribution .",
    "the rest of the information is encoded in the infinite set of n - point correlation functions . in particular",
    "the higher order ( @xmath1 ) functions provide the information about the coherence and shapes of large - scale structures such as filaments , walls , and voids that are apparent in both data and simulations .",
    "these higher order correlation functions add further constraints to be met by cold dark matter ( cdm ) models and new probes of the bias .",
    "for the most part observational studies of higher order correlation functions have measured correlations between galaxies . in this paper",
    "we will describe a method for measuring the galaxy - galaxy - mass three - point correlation function ( ggm3pcf ) with weak lensing .",
    "this method is a generalization of the method for measuring the galaxy - mass two - point correlation function ( gm2pcf ) with galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "just as the gm2pcf provided new constraints on the bias model , so too does the ggm3pcf .",
    "while the gm2pcf is a measure of the isotropic mass density around galaxies , the ggm3pcf gives us information about the shape of the mass distribution around pairs of galaxies .",
    "together with galaxy n - point functions and the gm2pcf , the ggm3pcf provides independent constraints on models of galaxy biasing that are crucial for understanding both large scale structure and the processes of galaxy formation .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that cdm models should predict that the mass around a pair of galaxies will have an anisotropic distribution . a priori it may be purely elliptical or clumped tightly about each galaxy with a distinctly bimodal appearance .",
    "this expectation comes from the fact that halos are not themeselves spherically symmetic and that the galaxies should also trace this ellipticity .",
    "also the galaxies themselevs have mass associates with them ; stellar mass at the least and probably dark matter sub - halos .",
    "whatever the details of the distribution is , it will create a gravitational lensing effect that is also anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropic lensing signal should be measurable with current and future weak lensing surveys .",
    "another use of the ggm3pcf is to test for the existence of dark matter itself .",
    "alternative theories of gravity with no dark matter , e.g. mond @xcite , must eventually make prediction for gravitational lensing .",
    "this predicted lensing profile must agree with the lensing observations . with no dark matter , the lensing effect is only caused by the visible matter .",
    "two galaxies that are close together will simply look like a monopole at large distance from them and the lensing effect produced should be nearly isotropic regardless of the form of the lensing profile .",
    "however , dark matter models predict ( as we will demonstrate ) that galaxy pairs have an extended dark matter halo about them that is anisotropic even at large distance from their center .",
    "this causes an anisotropic lensing effect at these large distances .",
    "thus , dark matter models and alternative models should make different predictions for the lensing anisotropy and thus test the idea of the existence of dark matter .",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "2003 have already claimed to have measured halo flattening around single galaxies , a similar effect , with weak lensing and argue that it would be difficult to reconcile this anisotropy with theories such as mond .",
    "measurements of the ggm3pcf would allow one to extend this result to scales larger than the size of individual galaxies .",
    "also , since the ggm3pcf deals with only the locations of galaxies , it would not have to rely on simulations that predict how the shape of the galaxy light correlates with the shape of the halo .    in this paper",
    ", we show how the lensing pattern around pairs of galaxies is related to the ggm3pcf .",
    "in particular , we show how the 2d projection of the 3d ggm3pcf is directly measurable with weak lensing measurements such as the measurements being conducted @xcite with data from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we use an n - body dark matter simulation populated with galaxies using a bias model chosen to reproduce the results of the hydrodynamical simulations and make numerical calculations of the various two and three - point correlation functions in both 2d and 3d .",
    "we calculate the lensing effect and estimate the amount of noise that should be present to study the signal - to - noise that can be obtained .",
    "we conclude that the ggm3pcf can now be measured with the present sdss data .",
    "we begin by reviewing galaxy correlation functions and then describe their extension to galaxy - mass cross - correlations .",
    "the probability of finding a galaxy ( or any mass point ) in an infinitesimal volume of space @xmath2 is simply @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean galaxy density .",
    "the probability of finding one galaxy in @xmath2 _ and _ another in @xmath5 defines the two - point correlation function @xmath6 @xmath7\\ ] ] the function @xmath6 can be thought of as the contribution of clustering to the joint probability in excess of random . by the assumed large scale homogeneity and isotropy",
    ", @xmath8 can depend only on @xmath9 and not on angle or location in space .",
    "the marginal probability of finding a galaxy in @xmath5 given that one already has found one in @xmath2 is @xmath10/\\rho_g dv_1 = \\rho_g dv_2 ~ [ 1 + \\xi_{gg}(r ) ] $ ] .",
    "we can further consider the probability of finding a third galaxy in infinitesimal volume @xmath11 in addition to the two in @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting joint probability defines the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , @xmath12 ,    @xmath13\\ ] ]    here @xmath14 refers to the separation between galaxies @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the point of defining @xmath12 so as to result in a 5-term expression is similar to the reason we defined a 2-term expression for the 2-point case .",
    "if the third galaxy were simply put down at random or not clustered with the first two , or very far from the first two , we would have @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "thus the other three terms , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath12 , only contribute the _ excess _ over this random occurrence and by symmetry of this argument we also get the next two terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the last term @xmath12",
    "is needed since there is no reason to assume that the first four terms completely describe the joint probability .",
    "the volume averages of the 2pcf , 3pcf , and higher order correlation functions are the moments of the probability distribution of the smoothed density field , e.g. the variance , skewness , kurtosis etc . since",
    "a gaussian distribution is characterized just by its 2pcf , the 3pcf is the lowest - order n - point statistic that characterizes non - gaussianity of the density field . generally non - linear gravitational effects generate a non - gaussian density distribution even if the initial density field is gaussian",
    ".    one can write down expressions for the joint probabilities of still more galaxies and these in turn will define the n - point correlation functions",
    ". the 3pcf @xmath12 , due to the large scale homogeneity and isotropy , is only a function of the three triangle sides @xmath20,@xmath21 , @xmath22 ( or any other parametrization of the triangle ) .",
    "one can also define cross correlation functions between different species of objects , for example , between galaxies and dark matter mass particles .",
    "we can write down joint probabilities of finding a galaxy and a mass particle , a galaxy and two mass particles , and two galaxies and a mass particle respectively ( taking all the @xmath23 to be equal in size for simplicity ) ,    @xmath24 \\\\",

    ".    one can also make the same definitions in 2d for a set of points that have been projected over the third dimension . in this case",
    "we will refer to these 2d correlation functions as , for example , @xmath30 for the two - point and @xmath31 for the three - point functions .",
    "the uses of correlation functions in cosmology are many . in the inflation scenario ,",
    "structure formation is seeded by random quantum fluctuations . in most models these initial fluctuations",
    "are predicted to be gaussian distributed and therefore completely described by their two - point correlation @xmath32 or its fourier transform the power spectrum @xmath33 . in this scenario ,",
    "the 3pcf and higher order correlation functions that arise are entirely due to the onset of non - linear gravitational collapse and so should be predictable with dark matter simulations given a set of cosmological parameters and a galaxy bias prescription .",
    "the first measurements of the galaxy two - point correlation function @xcite found that it was well described by a power law , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 mpc .",
    "the most recent measurements @xcite are now sensitive enough to detect small deviations from a power law , in agreement with predictions that use n - body simulation combined with hod bias models ( see section [ section : hod ] ) .    the first measurement of the 3pcf for galaxies was by @xcite .",
    "for these early correlation function measurements , there was no redshift information , so these were measured in terms of angular coordinates @xmath37 rather than physical length scales @xmath20 .",
    "constraints on the 3d 2pcf and 3pcf came from inverting the projections . from this first measurement , it was found that to experimental accuracy the 3pcf could be written in a reduced form relating it to the 2pcfs ( on scales less than a few mpcs ) as @xmath38 \\label{eq : zggg}\\ ] ] with q being a constant @xmath39 .",
    "this scaling relation is referred to as hierarchical scaling .",
    "although much effort has gone into deriving such an equation from first principles , no one has shown analytically why this form should be true .",
    "however n - body simulations do indicate that the 3pcf approximately takes this form in the non - linear regime probed by these early measurements . on larger scales",
    "( @xmath40 mpcs ) where one can treat gravity perturbatively , this factor q is indeed independent of scale however there is a non - vanishing dependence on triangle shape @xcite .",
    "this large scale shape dependence is a quantitative statement that co - linear triangles or filamentary structures are more likely than isosceles triangles or isotropic structures and physically relects the fact that gravitational collapse happens anisotropically with velocity flows along density gradients @xcite . a visual inspection of recent n - body simulations @xcite as well as real data from galaxy redshift surveys",
    "@xcite show the existence of large - scale filaments on the outskirts of giants voids .",
    "the basic hierarchical scaling of equation [ eq : zggg ] was confirmed by @xcite however these early measurements from the lick galaxy catalog did not extend to large enough scales to reveal the expected configuration - dependent signature from gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "later results by @xcite using the apm survey data , @xcite using the iras 1.2 jy survey and @xcite using the iras pscz survey were in good agreement with the predictions from the gravitational instability picture and provided new constraints on the bias for these samples .",
    "these studies have had much success at measuring the 2pcf and 3pcf of galaxies .",
    "furthermore n - body simulations have been able to make precise predictions , given the cosmological parameters , of the 2pcf and 3pcf of the mass density .",
    "however until recently the galaxy - mass correlation functions have remained unmeasured .",
    "the measurements of the 3pcf of galaxies in fact can be used to constrain the large scale bias between galaxies and mass but the smaller scale bias has mostly remained a mystery . the fact that on small scales the observed 2pcf of galaxies and the 2pcf of mass from n - body simulations disagree leads to the requirement that there must be scale dependent bias between galaxies and mass if the cdm framework is correct .",
    "another indicator of this complexity is that different populations of galaxies have different measured correlation functions and therefore are biased differently relative to each other .",
    "there is no reason why any particular sample of galaxies should trace the dark matter exactly .",
    "trying to measure and model the bias using galaxy - mass correlations is one of the main goals of galaxy - galaxy lensing and the galaxy - mass 3pcf should help achieve this goal .",
    "the general relativistic lens equation relates the bending angle of light rays to the mass distribution . in the thin lens approximation",
    "the deflection can be computed from the projected surface mass density @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the coordinate along the line of sight .",
    "it is customary make this dimensionless by dividing by the geometric factor @xmath43 , where the distances are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source .",
    "this defines a dimensionless 2d mass density , or convergence , @xmath44 .",
    "it is useful to define a 2d potential @xmath45 one can show that @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfy poisson s equation @xmath48 where the subscripts with commas denote derivatives transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the other second derivatives of @xmath49 define the shear , @xmath50 the two - component polar @xmath51 is related to the anisotropic stretching of the source galaxy shapes in a linear way . with the ellipticity components defined in terms of the second moments of the galaxy light then it can be shown that @xmath52 .",
    "thus measurements of galaxy ellipticities provide an estimate of the shear .",
    "these measurements are noisy because galaxies are intrinsically elliptical with @xmath53 .",
    "therefore accurate shear measurements require one to average over enough galaxies to reduce this `` shape noise '' to @xmath54 .",
    "see @xcite for a review .    because @xmath46 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are all related to @xmath47 it is possible to determine @xmath46 from the measurable @xmath51 .",
    "one such relation is @xmath57 to solve for @xmath46 one needs to solve this partial differential equation , which states that the derivative of @xmath46 is locally related to the derivative of the shear . by fourier transforming this equation ( or equations [ eq : def - shear ] and [ eq : kappa - poisson ] ) one can see that @xmath46 is locally related to the shear in fourier space , but in real space it is related to the shear non - locally ( i.e. it involves a convolution ) .",
    "there is also the problem of the mass sheet degeneracy : @xmath46 can only be measured up to a constant with shear data .",
    "weak lensing first became a useful tool in cosmology as a method of measuring the projected mass around rich clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "rich clusters are massive enough that the surface mass density is close to the critical surface mass density @xmath58 ( sometimes greater ) and so there are sometimes giant arcs @xcite and even if not , the lensing shear is often very large and so can be measured reliably .",
    "various methods of inverting the shear map to produce 2d mass maps for clusters have been developed @xcite , based on the original work by @xcite .",
    "we will refer to any of these algorithms simply as ks algorithms .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing ( ggl ) denotes the lensing of background source galaxies by individual foreground lens galaxies . in this case",
    ", one does not have large enough signal - to - noise ratio to reliably measure the signal around each lens galaxy ; instead one must average the signal for many lens galaxies and be content with this statistical measure . the first attempt to measure ggl @xcite found only an upper limit .",
    "the first detection was by @xcite followed by @xcite .",
    "the first very significant measurement was by @xcite in the sdss followed by other high s / n results @xcite .",
    "the latest result by @xcite makes high signal - to - noise ratio measurements of the 3d galaxy - mass correlation function and the bias .",
    "the early ggl studies concentrated more on small scales ( @xmath59 mpc ) and were interested in constraining the mass to light ratios by modeling the mass profiles as isothermal spheres and extracting a velocity dispersion . however the best way to interpret ggl , especially at larger scales , is as a measurement of the galaxy - mass two - point correlation function ( gm2pcf ) , @xmath60 .",
    "the average density of mass around a galaxy can be written @xmath61\\ ] ] after dropping the constant mass sheet which produces no lensing , the 2d mass over - density is just the projection @xmath62 where @xmath42 denotes the radial coordinate ; i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "this defines the projected gm2pcf , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the distance from galaxy to mass particle projected in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "when the average mass profile is circularly symmetric , as in this case , the mean tangential shear @xmath66 in an annulus of radius @xmath65 can be expressed in terms of @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the average @xmath70 inside a circle of radius @xmath65 and @xmath67 is the mean in a narrow annulus of radius @xmath65 . written out in terms of @xmath30 ,",
    "this is @xmath71 \\label{eq : int - wgm}\\ ] ]    differentiating with respect to @xmath65 , one arrives at @xmath72    one could then integrate this equation to get @xmath64 in terms of tangential shear measurements .",
    "the unknown constant of integration is simply due to the usual mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "this equation is the circularly symmetric equivalent to equation [ eq : kaiser - del ] and in fact can be derived by writing that equation in polar coordinates and assuming @xmath46 is only a function of @xmath65 .",
    "however rather than integrating this equation to get @xmath64 one can calculate the 3d @xmath60 directly . since @xmath60 is spherically symmetric",
    ", there exists an inversion formula for the projection called the abel integral formula @xcite .",
    "@xmath73 this equation was also used by @xcite to obtain the galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation function from the measured projected correlation function in the iras survey .",
    "equation [ eq : deriv - wgm ] can be substituted into equation [ eq : xi - invert ] to compute the galaxy mass correlation function from the shear measurements .",
    "this inversion method was recently used in @xcite to make the first direct measurements of the 3d gm2pcf from weak lensing .    one thing to note about equation [ eq : xi - invert ] is that one does not have data out to infinitely large @xmath65 .",
    "if one has data from scales @xmath74 to @xmath75 then one can measure @xmath60 only on these scales , and one can perform the integration only up to @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a correction @xmath78 to evaluate the correction term , one can either extrapolate @xmath64 beyond the data region or use a model for @xmath60 .",
    "either way , this results in a model dependence or uncertainty in the correction .",
    "fortunately , because @xmath60 drops off rapidly ( typically like @xmath79 or faster at large scales ) this correction term is negligible for any reasonable @xmath60 except for @xmath9 close to @xmath75 .",
    "the first applicaion of this inversion method to galaxy - galaxy lensing was @xcite and a complete treatment of the method is given in @xcite .",
    "just as the galaxy - mass two - point correlation function can be measured with the lensing signal around a galaxy , the galaxy - galaxy - mass three - point correlation function ( ggm3pcf ) can be measured with the lensing signal around pairs of galaxies . here",
    "we derive the convergence field @xmath46 around pairs of galaxies separated by a projected distance @xmath80 .    in 3d , the probability of finding two galaxies and a mass particle in some triangular configuration in three infinitesimal volume elements , each of common size @xmath23 , is given by equation [ eq : ggm3 ] .",
    "we call this @xmath81 , where 1 and 2 indicate the galaxies and 3 indicates the mass particle .",
    "when we already have a pair of galaxies and just ask what is the probability of finding a mass particle , this is the conditional probability @xmath82 dividing this expression by @xmath23 and multiplying by the mass per particle yields the average _ density _ of mass around pairs of galaxies separated by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath83 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\rho_{crit } \\omega_m~\\left[~ 1 + \\frac{\\xi_{gm}(r_{13 } ) + \\xi_{gm}(r_{23 } )   + \\zeta_{ggm}}{1 + \\xi_{gg}(r_{12 } ) } ~\\right ] \\label{eq : rho - pair-3d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with weak lensing , we find galaxy pairs at some projected distance @xmath80 and want to know the 2d projected mass density around these galaxies .",
    "so we need to project the mass over the radial direction but also average over the unknown radial distance between the two galaxies .",
    "even though we may have measured redshifts for both galaxies , they can not be used to calculate this radial distance precisely because the radial peculiar velocities cause redshift distortions . following @xcite , where a similar projection is performed , we define @xmath84 to be the unknown radial distance between the two galaxies and @xmath85 to be the unknown radial distance between galaxy 1 and the mass particle ( labeled 3 ) .",
    "the radial distance between galaxy 2 and the mass particle therefore is @xmath86 , since the three points define a triangle . with these two numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 we can write the 3d distances in terms of the 2d projected distances @xmath87    to average over @xmath84 , we need the normalized probability distribution @xmath88 , @xmath89 one can see that this distribution is improper in the sense that one can not normalize it over @xmath90 .",

    "implictly assumes that the correlation functions do not extend over large enough distances to change the focusing strength",
    ". a more general expression would include the radially varying @xmath99 inside the projection @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation functions are only appreciable over several mpcs , while @xmath99 typically varies over several hundred mpcs and so this is a reasonable approximation .",

    "n - body simulations will be used to calculate the projected galaxy - mass correlation functions , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and equation [ eq : kappa - pair-2 ] then predicts @xmath109 around galaxy pairs for a survey of a given depth .",
    "equations [ eq : lens - potential ] to [ eq : def - shear ] tell us how to take a convergence @xmath46 and compute the resulting shear map . furthermore we can apply the ks algorithm to the shear map to reconstruct the @xmath46 map . equation [ eq : kappa - pair-2 ] also tells us how to interpret this reconstructed @xmath46 map in terms of projected correlation functions . since the term @xmath110 is just the projection of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath8 , which we can measure , and since we can also will measure @xmath30 by the usual two - point galaxy - galaxy lensing method ( described in section [ section : gal - gal - lensing ] ) , we can measure the 2d three - point function @xmath31 directly from these other measured functions and the reconstructed @xmath46 .    if one lets the maximum radial galaxy separation , @xmath111 , go to infinity , one does not get any contribution from @xmath31 .",
    "this just says that with an infinite background of galaxies , the ratio of physical galaxy pairs to random projected galaxy pairs will go to zero .",
    "if one s goal is to measure the ggm3pcf , then one should not make this measurement around pairs with widely different redshifts : they only give contributions from their projected two - point terms @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which provides no new information beyond what one has already measured with two - point galaxy - galaxy lensing .    instead one should set @xmath111 no larger than the scale of measurable galaxy correlations",
    ". a good value might be @xmath114 mpc , since the 2pcfs are small beyond that and dominate over the 3pcf though one might want to make @xmath111 larger when making measurements at larger scales . at a minimum , one will want @xmath111 greater than a few times the maximum projected scales at which one is making the measurements .",
    "in fact one could choose @xmath111 smaller to attempt to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement .",
    "however at smaller scales redshift distortions make the interpretation of radial distance problematic and so this probably will not prove useful . making cuts on redshift differences at any scale",
    "should really be interpreted as a `` fuzzy selection '' in physical space .",
    "this selection function @xmath115 can be modeled with n - body simulations and incorporated into the integrals above , rather than assume the top - hat form , to better interpret the measurements .",
    "we can now estimate at which scales the three - point function @xmath31 will dominate over the two - point terms in equation [ eq : kappa - pair-2 ] . for simplicity",

    "we will study this further in section [ section : sig - noise ] .",
    "the halo occupation distribution models ( hod ) provide a simplified prescription for populating simulated or analytic dark matter halos with galaxies . in the hod framework @xcite , one makes the assumption that the number of galaxies , @xmath137 , that occupy a dark matter halo is drawn from a distribution @xmath138 that only depends on @xmath139 , the mass of the halo . a priori",
    ", one might imagine that this is too restrictive and that the probability distribution could depend on other parameters such as the shape of the halo , the formation time , the local density of other halos , or a host of other parameters .",
    "however , hydrodynamical simulations indicate that halo mass is the controlling factor .",
    "once one has determined the number of galaxies in each halo , one needs to decide on how to distribute the galaxies within each halo .",
    "together these two choices define a complete halo occupation prescription .",
    "the chief usefulness of the hod model for large scale structure studies is that it provides a model for galaxy bias and therefore allows one to compute the various galaxy correlation functions in a straightforward manner .",
    "this technique was first used with randomly placed clusters with specified radial profiles by @xcite to predict clustering statistics and also by @xcite used similar models to compute the galaxy correlation function .",
    "more modern treatments benefit from knowledge of the halo mass function @xcite and halo mass profiles @xcite that are seen in n - body simulations .",
    "another reason for the recent revival of this technique is the success of semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "these models , which try to simulate the complex physics of galaxy formation , produce hods which when combined with n - body dark matter simulations , result in a galaxy auto - correlation function that resembles the observed power law @xcite . due to this improved knowledge of the mass function , halos profiles , and the hod ,",
    "there has been much recent work on computing the various n - point galaxy correlation functions with the halo model formalism @xcite .    in the purely analytic halo model formalism ,",
    "one combines the hod with an analytic halo mass function and analytic halos profiles that are fit from n - body simulations .",
    "another approach is to take an n - body dark matter simulation , identify halos , and populate these halos directly with galaxies using the hod prescription .",
    "this is the method we will use in this study .",
    "this method yields a set of dark matter positions and a set of galaxy positions that one can use to calculate the various correlation and cross correlation functions .",
    "it has the advantage that it samples a realistic distribution of halo shapes and structures not captured by the analytic method , which usually assumes spherical halos with a universal profile . in particular , while the constraint of spherical halos should not matter for the 2pcfs , it may be more important for the higher n - point functions since they are anisotropic .",
    "in fact , the analytic halo models do not agree precisely with n - body predictions for the 3pcf , because the former are not hierarchical on small scales .",
    "however , populating dark matter simulations with galaxies also has its drawbacks .",
    "one problem is that if one wants to change the dark matter power spectrum or vary other cosmological parameters , one needs to run another n - body simulation . with the purely analytic technique",
    ", one can calculate the various correlation functions simply with numerical integrations ; to change cosmological parameters one just has to re - run these integration routines , which take far less cpu time .",
    "thus with the purely analytic technique one can explore parameter space more efficiently . also with the purely analytic technique one can compute the various statistics with no errors . with the n - body population technique one always has shot noise and sample variance .",
    "however if one has a large enough volume and enough particles and galaxies , one can make predictions that will have theoretical errors smaller than errors coming from real survey data .",
    "another thing to note about the analytic models is that the 2pcfs are easily computed with simple one dimensional numerical integrations but the higher order n - point functions can require much higher order numerical integration .",
    "for example , to compute the full three - point function one must compute a seven - dimensional numerical integral and since this is generally intractable , one has to resort to some approximation methods @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extra numerical computation , the mathematical expressions become significantly more complicated and require more assumptions about parameters and input from simulations .",
    "the n - body dark matter simulation used for this study is the public simulation made available at http://pac1.berkeley.edu / sim1/. this simulation has @xmath140 particles in a periodic cube of length 300 @xmath141 mpc .",

    "equation [ eq : hod - mass ] gives the mean number of galaxies for a halo of mass @xmath139 .",
    "we must allow some scatter when we choose the number of galaxies for each halo .",
    "since we must choose an integer number , we choose either one of the integers bracketing the mean with relative probabilities that keep the mean constrained to equal equation [ eq : hod - mass ] when the mean is non - integer .",
    "when @xmath159 is an integer , we simply choose that number with no variance .",
    "this leads to a variance that is substantially sub - poisson and in fact is the minimum variance that is not identically zero . to be more specific ,",

    "also one can see that on these small scales , @xmath60 is greater than @xmath6 . both of these qualitative results are expected with the hod framework . on small scales , the 2pcfs are dominated by the contribution of galaxies in the smaller halos @xcite , which are the most abundant ; many of them contain only one galaxy at the center of the halo .",
    "because the galaxy is at the center , @xmath60 traces the cusp of the dark matter halo and will therefore be steepest at small scales .",
    "@xmath171 is smoothed out somewhat , because this is basically the halo profile convolved with itself . in the case of @xmath6 , it is suppressed at small scales due to the fact that small halos have a @xmath138 that excludes a second galaxy , so @xmath8 only gets contributions from bigger halos and the two - halo term ( galaxies in different halos ) .",
    "this argument explains qualitatively why @xmath60 is the largest at small scales .",
    "the most likely reason why @xmath6 is larger than @xmath171 is that the @xmath138 gives more weight to smaller halos for @xmath6 and one galaxy is always at the center .",

    "the region in the middle is a region of constructive interference where the shear from each galaxy has the same phase ( i.e. , direction ) , so this is where the shear is the largest .",
    "there is also a ring of destructive interference where the shear from each galaxy cancels out the other and no net shear is produced .    in figure",
    "[ fig : shear4 ] we show the individual shear components around the same 2d density map . here",

    "it also shows how @xmath245 has elliptical contours on larger scales .    in figure",
    "[ fig : shear4-tan ] we show the tangential shear @xmath66 and the radial shear @xmath246 defined as @xmath247 and @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the angle from the midpoint of the @xmath217-axis .",

    "black is zero and white is 1 .",
    "the bottom plots show how at large scales the shear is almost entirely tangential whereas at small scales the pattern is complicated and both @xmath66 and @xmath246 make contributions .",
    "= 12.0 cm    this is an example of how there is an approximate symmetry that allows one to ignore the radial shear component at large scales . on these scales",
    "one can just measure the tangential component and see how its magnitude changes as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath249 .",
    "for example figure [ fig : shear - theta ] shows the tangential shear in an annulus ( centered between the galaxies ) of radius @xmath251 mpc , as a function of @xmath249 ( measured from the @xmath217-axis ) , divided by the mean value in the annulus .",
    "a quadrupole pattern is evident and we over - plot the function @xmath252 with @xmath253 .",
    "one can relate the moments of the shear map to moments of @xmath46 through methods developed by @xcite .",
    "so far we have calculated the shear signal we expect around foreground galaxy pairs , and now we investigate the amount of noise we expect .",
    "the noise in a weak lensing measurement is almost entirely due to shot noise from galaxy shapes , although on the largest scales , sample variance can increase the variance and add some covariance @xcite .",
    "we will only discuss the shot noise since it is the dominant source of noise on scales less than a few mpc .",
    "the shot noise on a particular measurement of @xmath254 is about @xmath255 , where @xmath256 represents the rms intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies divided by 2 .",
    "the number @xmath137 for ggl is the number of lens - source galaxy pairs in a given radial bin . for our analysis",
    ", we have pairs of lens galaxies and so @xmath137 is the number of lens - lens - source triplets in a given measurement bin .",
    "we now estimate what this number @xmath137 will be .",
    "if we have @xmath257 foreground galaxy pairs in a given projected separation bin , @xmath80 , and a 2d number density @xmath258 of source galaxies , then the number of triplets is just @xmath259 where @xmath260 is some surface area element in which we estimate the shear .",
    "we have assumed that the source density @xmath258 is uncorrelated with the density of foreground pairs , which should be correct if lens and source galaxies are at different redshifts . to estimate the number of lens galaxy pairs ,",
    "we calculate the average number of neighbors per galaxy , @xmath261 , in a thin annulus about projected separation @xmath65 of width @xmath262 .",
    "this is just an integral over the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xcite , @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the 3d number density of lens galaxies .",
    "the total number of pairs in this bin is then @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the total number of lens galaxies .",
    "the number @xmath266 is just the number density @xmath264 times the comoving volume probed by the survey , @xmath267 .",
    "finally we can write the number of lens - lens - source triplets , @xmath137 , in surface area element @xmath260 for lens pairs separated by @xmath268 as @xmath269    the galaxy number density in our simulation is @xmath270 , which roughly corresponds to an effective absolute magnitude cut of @xmath271 .",
    "for this absolute magnitude cut , the sdss probes an effective survey volume of approximately @xmath272 @xcite , where @xmath273 is the fraction of the sky covered . for the sdss",
    ", @xmath273 will eventually be close to 1/4 .",
    "the number density of source galaxies used for lensing from @xcite is @xmath274 .",
    "the area element da in @xmath275 is da=@xmath276 where @xmath277 is the pixel size in physical units that we will use for our shear map and @xmath278 is the angular diameter distance to redshift @xmath279 .",
    "we will choose @xmath238 , the median redshift for the sdss spectroscopic survey , and @xmath280 for the estimated sky coverage of the completed sdss , which gives @xmath281 .",
    "with these numbers our expression for @xmath137 becomes @xmath282    with this formula we are able to add noise to our shear maps that should correspond to what we will see if we do an analysis similar to @xcite with sdss data in the near future to measure the mass density around pairs .",
    "we take our predicted shear map shown in figure [ fig : shear - map - whole ] , which corresponds to @xmath237 mpc , and add gaussian noise with @xmath283 to each component of the shear .",
    "the resulting noisy shear map is shown in figure [ fig : shear - map - noise ] .",
    "the basic tangential pattern can still be seen behind the noise .",
    "= 12.0 cm    we can now process both the noisy shear map and the noiseless one to reconstruct @xmath46 with a ks mass reconstruction algorithm .",
    "we use the `` direct method '' of @xcite .",
    "this inversion routine reconstructs the mass map by solving for the fourier modes on a chosen grid that minimize the functional @xmath284 where @xmath285 the euler - lagrange equations of this functional are just equations [ eq : kaiser - del ] that we saw related the measured shear to @xmath46 .",
    "this routine is linear and can be done quickly with fast fourier transforms . unlike the earliest ks algorithms this one does not have edge effect biases other than slightly increased noise in the bounding bins .",
    "the process involves choosing a grid scale , averaging the shear in the grid bins , calculating @xmath286 by finite differencing the shear values , and then running lombardi and bertin s routine ( which is publicly available ) on the array @xmath287 .",
    "the resulting reconstruction will be degraded in resolution for two reasons .",
    "first , one will usually want to choose a grid scale that gives reasonable signal - to - noise per pixel .",
    "this is purely a pixelization effect and structures smaller than the pixel scale will be lost .",
    "second , the reconstruction algorithm which differences neighbors introduces an effective smoothing between neighboring pixels .",
    "we display the reconstruction in figure [ fig : recon4 ] .",
    "the top right is the original @xmath46 binned down to the same grid resolution of the reconstruction .",
    "the top right shows the @xmath46 recovered from the noisy shear map via the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the bottom left shows the residual , which is consistent with zero .",
    "the bottom right shows a slice through both maps that intersects both peaks around the galaxies . since the reconstruction can not recover the constant mass sheet we have subtracted off the mean from each map before plotting .",
    "we have calculated the weak lensing shear around pairs of galaxies and related it directly to the 3d galaxy - galaxy - mass three - point correlation function .",
    "we have shown that the 2d mass profile can be reconstructed from the shear map around galaxy pairs and we have discussed how to interpret this in terms of the correlation functions . with our n - body simulation and hod bias model",
    "we have calculated the expected signal and have estimated the amount of noise to be expected in a model survey similar to the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "although this prediction is only meant to be a first attempt at estimating the effect and does not exhaust the possibilities we predict that this signal may be measurable with current sdss lensing data .",
    "the anisotropic dark matter profile about two galaxies extends far away from their center and will produce an anisotropic tangential shear profile .",
    "measurements confirming this will be difficult to reconcile with alternative theories of gravity that need to produce weak lensing shear without any extended anisotropic dark matter halos .",
    "on the other hand we have seen that they are a natural prediction of cdm .",
    "the three - point function better specifies how mass traces galaxies and so provides more detailed information over that contained in the isotropic galaxy - mass two - point correlation function .",
    "this exact form of the measured galaxy - galaxy - mass correlation function will provide additional constraints on galaxy bias models that govern how galaxies trace the underlying dark matter .",

    "i would also like to thank martin white for providing the n - body simulations and andreas for providing the galaxy occupation .",
