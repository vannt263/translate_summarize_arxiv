    "+   +  hal 9000 , in _ 2001 : a space odyssey _ +    although the film s supercomputer was referring to a faulty communications device , its statement turned out to carry universal truth , much to the dismay of the ill - fated crew of _ discovery_. and not only was the fault indeed induced by humans , it was of a fundamentally different nature than the crew initially thought .",
    "this is characteristic of research in theoretical physics .",
    "the quest for an ultimate theory that will explain all the forces of nature in a single , beautiful principle , is a typically human one . besides a curiosity about the world around us ,",
    "we are driven by our desire for aesthetics and simplicity .",
    "sometimes so much so that we are tempted to make oversimplified assumptions about nature , such as the aristotelian `` natural state , '' or copernicus circular planetary orbits .",
    "we may be unaware of the error , building entire theories on our flawed axioms , and not until disaster strikes do we realise just how fundamental a mistake we have made .",
    "it is easy to make such mistakes because nature often turns out to be much more peculiar than we ever imagined , displaying counterintuitive effects like the particle - wave duality . at first",
    ", such weirdness might be misconstrued as complications . but",
    "going along with it usually in the end leads to an even simpler picture of the world , bringing us closer to a unified theory of everything .",
    "so as a physicist , one learns to accept ridiculous ideas just for the sake of argument .",
    "one such `` ridiculous idea '' constitutes the foundation of string theory .",
    "the idea is that all elementary particles are actually vibrating strings .",
    "this was put forward by phycisists in the seventies , after failing to use string theory to describe the strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics does a better job of that ) .",
    "it was realised that string theory unifies gravity with the three forces described by quantum field theory  electromagnetism , the weak force and the strong force . because the basic building blocks are one - dimensional objects , strings , instead of zero - dimensional point particles , string theory does not suffer from the divergences of quantum field theory .    the fact that strings are one - dimensional leads to a vast range of possible string states .",
    "strings can be open ( two ends ) or closed ( ends joined ) , and they can oscillate in a multitude of ways .",
    "the different states that arise in this way correspond to different particles .",
    "that is , instead of the plethora of fundamental particles in the standard model , we have only one type of fundamental object ; all matter can be explained as strings in different states .",
    "but string theory is not a simple theory , in any sense of the word .",
    "what keeps string theory a field in development is the fact that it is technically very difficult , often impossible , to perform exact calculations .",
    "one is frequently forced to approximate , or resort to hand - waving .",
    "furthermore , string theory is actually not a single theory ; it is _ five _ different theories , all individually consistent , but with different characteristics . some describe only closed strings , others both open and closed , the strings may be oriented or unoriented , and the theories have different symmetries , etc . at first sight",
    "these theories seem to be very far from anything resembling realistic physics .",
    "for one thing , they are in general _ supersymmetric _ , i.e.  they demand the existence of superpartners of all observed particles , none of which have shown up in experiments as yet .",
    "another nuisance is their requirement of no less than ten spacetime dimensions to live in .",
    "nevertheless , in the course of time there has been an increasing amount of order brought to this mess , in the form of symmetries and dualities .",
    "it turns out that the five string theories are related to each other via various dualities , so that they are manifestly equivalent in different limits .",
    "one nice thing about this is that computations that are difficult in one picture may become easier in the dual picture .",
    "more interestingly , there is mounting evidence that , at the end of the day , all these theories are just different limits of one and the same underlying theory , our holy grail .",
    "this is why the understanding of dualities in string theory is of paramount importance .      in the nineties",
    ", it was discovered that in addition to strings , string theory contains other types of extended dynamical objects , called dirichlet branes ( _ d - branes _ ) . the name comes from their function as hypersurfaces on which open strings can end  an endpoint stuck to a d - brane obeys dirichlet conditions .",
    "they can be of any dimension as long as it fits inside the ten dimensions of string theory .",
    "d - branes play a crucial role in relating the different string theories to each other , primarily via their transformation properties under duality .",
    "one way of dealing with the six surplus spacetime dimensions ( since we experience only four ) , is to compactify them on tiny spaces , like wrapping a piece of paper around a pencil . from a distance",
    "the paper then looks one - dimensional , and we are rid of one dimension . besides reducing the number of dimensions",
    ", this technique has the advantage that the `` compact '' part of the string theory shows up as matter in the noncompact dimensions .",
    "we can thus construct the four - dimensional theory of our choice by compactifying on the appropriate manifold .    in this context d - branes are useful for visualising where in the ten - dimensional string theory our four - dimensional world fits .",
    "if we choose a d - brane with four spacetime dimensions ( a d3-brane ) , then the part of string theory that lives on its _ worldvolume _ would describe the physics of the universe as we know it .",
    "of course we would need to break a lot of symmetries first , especially supersymmetry , but in essence this is the picture .",
    "this thesis is divided into two chapters ; the first one is concerned with paper  i , and the second with papers  ii  iv .    [",
    "[ moduli - spaces ] ] moduli spaces + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the realisation of physics as the worldvolume theory of a d - brane is the topic of chapter  [ moduli ] . after providing some basics concerning lie algebras , we discuss the rather multifaceted background of paper  i. the centre of attention is the space of vacua ( _ moduli _ ) in the worldvolume theory of d3-branes , which splits into different branches depending on the particular configuration we are looking at .",
    "we explain how these branches of vacua arise , first from a purely field - theoretical point of view , and then from a string theory perspective .",
    "the object of paper  i was to show the equivalence between the moduli spaces of two different theories , the _",
    "e@xmath0 quiver gauge theory _ , and the _ e@xmath0 seiberg - witten theory _ , in order to substantiate a conjectured duality between them .",
    "we define these two theories and give a brief account of the method used to compare the moduli spaces .",
    "[ [ boundary - conditions ] ] boundary conditions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the dynamics of open superstrings is described by the supersymmetric _ non - linear sigma model _ , which is a field theory in two dimensions .",
    "the domain of this model is the two - dimensional worldsheet of the string , i.e.  the surface that the string sweeps out as it moves through spacetime . since the string has two ends , this domain has two boundaries , which by definition are attached to d - branes .",
    "so studying boundary conditions of the sigma model is equivalent to studying the geometrical properties of d - branes .",
    "in particular , these conditions should be consistent with the way d - branes transform under duality .",
    "for instance , _ t - duality _ changes the dimension of the d - brane , and the duality transformation acting on the boundary conditions should yield the same result .",
    "this was our prime motivation in deriving the most general boundary conditions possible , in papers  ii  iii .",
    "more precisely , we derived _",
    "boundary conditions , i.e.  conditions for the boundary to respect the super- and conformal symmetries that are preserved in the bulk of the worldsheet .",
    "chapter  [ boundary ] provides some background to that derivation and explains how it was done . in paper",
    "iv we applied our analysis to the _ wzw model _ ,",
    "a special case of the nonlinear sigma model ; the last section is devoted to that .",
    "this thesis touches on many different topics , from f - theory to almost product structures , all of them incredibly rich fields .",
    "we will not go into great depth in any of these subjects , only give a brief review of those aspects that are directly relevant to the accompanying papers .",
    "i have tried to keep the discussion on a basic level , for the most part assuming that the reader is not an expert .",
    "however , it has proven unavoidable to sometimes state facts without justification , where an explanation would be much too involved .",
    "i have also tried to make each chapter selfcontained , but inevitably , chapter  [ boundary ] does make use of some concepts introduced in chapter  [ moduli ]",
    ".    moreover , as frequently becomes apparent in string theory , computational techniques , and even notation , are not of secondary importance .",
    "this is definitely true in the work presented here , where reaching the goal depended crucially on the method of getting there . despite this",
    ", we will not linger on technical details , only mention briefly the approach taken in each case .    the interesting part is after all the conclusions .",
    "they clarify but a small fraction of the huge scientific effort which is string theory , but i still believe that this theory is the path to follow in our search for the ultimate principle .    indeed , there is every indication that string theory is not merely a misconception , due to human error .",
    "in this chapter we will be dealing with four - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories and their moduli spaces , realised as worldvolume theories on d3-branes . the exact worldvolume action ( i.e.  including massive fields ) on a d - brane is not known , although considerable effort is being invested in finding it @xcite .",
    "so reliable analysis is possible strictly in the low - energy effective theories , where only massless fields are considered .",
    "such theories are described by _ super - yang - mills _ theories , which will be our main concern here .    in particular ,",
    "we are interested in the spaces of vacua in the yang - mills theories .",
    "these are obtained by applying the _",
    "higgs mechanism _ to the scalar potential ; this mechanism renders gauge bosons massive via spontaneous symmetry breaking , and is a candidate for explaining the origin of mass . in @xmath2=2 super - yang - mills theory",
    "it gives rise to two moduli space branches , the _ coulomb branch _ and the _ higgs branch_. in string theory , this moduli space corresponds to the space transverse to d - branes sitting in ten dimensions .    to construct four - dimensional theories from string theory ,",
    "one usually compactifies the `` superfluous '' dimensions on very small spaces so that they become invisible in everyday , low - energy physics .",
    "these compact spaces are subject to a set of restrictions in order that the resulting theory be consistent ; such spaces are known as _ calabi - yau manifolds _ @xcite . a complex - one - dimensional calabi - yau manifold is topologically always a torus , while in two complex dimensions all calabi - yau manifolds are topologically equivalent to the _ k3 surface _ @xcite .",
    "the latter space has orbifold singularities and is the one relevant to us here .",
    "the great thing about string theory in this context is that it remains well - behaved even when compactified on singular spaces such as these orbifolds .",
    "it is believed that most , if not all , calabi - yau manifolds have an associated _ mirror manifold _ ,",
    "i.e.  a manifold whose complex structure moduli are exchanged with the khler structure moduli as compared to the original calabi - yau @xcite .",
    "this is a very important result since it has an implication that string theories compactified on two mirror manifolds are equivalent ( dual ) to each other . as a consequence ,",
    "if the moduli spaces of two conformal field theories make up a mirror pair , then the corresponding theories are dual to each other @xcite .",
    "intriligator and seiberg @xcite showed how a duality between two different gauge theories in three dimensions corresponds to a mirror symmetry between their respective moduli spaces .",
    "the two kinds of theories are , on the one hand , three - dimensional ade _",
    "quiver theories _ ( as constructed by kronheimer @xcite ) , and on the other hand @xmath3 gauge theory with ade global symmetry ( _ seiberg - witten theory _ ) .",
    "this mirror symmetry exchanges the coulomb branch of one theory with the higgs branch of the other , and vice versa .",
    "the two branches are in fact geometrically identical , but the mirror exchange is interesting from a physics point of view . in particular , the mass parameters",
    "( which are associated with complex structure ) of one theory are interchanged with the fayet - iliopoulos parameters ( associated with khler structure ) of the other theory .",
    "since the four - dimensional versions of these theories are related to the three - dimensional ones via compactification , one might suspect that there is a similar mirror symmetry acting in four dimensions .",
    "in fact , a higgs - coulomb identity analogous to that of the three - dimensional case was confirmed in @xcite , for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 four - dimensional theories .",
    "the remaining two of the strongly coupled superconformal @xmath2=2 theories , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , were shown to also satisfy such higgs - coulomb identities , in @xcite and paper  i , respectively . just like in three dimensions ,",
    "the four - dimensional mirror symmetry would provide a map between mass parameters of one theory and fayet - iliopoulos parameters of the other .",
    "one very useful consequence of such a mirror symmetry is that , since the coulomb branch receives quantum corrections but the higgs branch does not ( due to @xmath2=2 supersymmetry ) , quantum effects in one theory arise classically in the dual theory , and vice versa .",
    "this facilitates the analysis of nonperturbative phenomena enormously .",
    "although the @xmath9 theory does have some interest in itself , for instance in explaining the @xmath9 gauge symmetry of the heterotic string , the main motivation for establishing the moduli space equivalence for @xmath9 was to complete the analysis for the whole series of strongly coupled superconformal @xmath2=2 theories .",
    "knowing that there is a true duality between the quiver theory and the seiberg - witten theory , one could use this to analyse the quantum behaviour of physically more interesting theories such as @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , some knowledge of simple lie algebras is required , so we start by listing some fundamental facts about these in section  [ liealg ] .",
    "we then move on to discuss @xmath2=2 supersymmetric yang - mills theories in section  [ yangmills ] , showing how the moduli space of vacua arises as a result of the higgs mechanism .",
    "next , we define the two different gauge theories involved in the duality discussed above , namely seiberg - witten theory ( section  [ swtheory ] ) and quiver theory ( section  [ quiver ] ) .",
    "the latter section ends with a brief account of the computation done in paper  i.    before proceeding , however , let us clarify a fundamental point , namely the difference between `` perturbative '' and `` low - energy effective . ''",
    "a theory can be treated _ perturbatively _ when the coupling constant is so small that an expansion in powers of the coupling constant is dominated by the first few terms . on the other hand , a theory is a _ low - energy effective _ theory when any massive states are so heavy compared to some fixed energy scale ( e.g.  the cutoff scale in renormalisation ) that they completely decouple from the theory .",
    "thus , for instance , the seiberg - witten theory is a strongly coupled gauge theory where we have discarded all massive states and retain only the massless ones .    with that , we are ready to embrace some representation theory .",
    "lie algebra theory is an essential instrument in a physicist s mathematical toolbox .",
    "this is due to the close connection to vector fields on manifolds , the most important example of which are those on spacetime .",
    "as the name suggests , lie algebras are the algebras of _ lie groups _ , which by definition are groups endowed with the properties of a smooth manifold .",
    "examples of such groups are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 vector fields on such a manifold form a lie algebra .",
    "we will be concerned only with _",
    "simple _ lie algebras , i.e.  lie algebras of finite dimension greater than one and which contain no nontrivial ideals .",
    "the complete list of such algebras is not extensive , but the only ones relevant to us are : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first two correspond to the groups @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , whereas the @xmath18 algebras correspond to three _ exceptional _ groups , defined e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "these groups are usually referred to collectively as ade symmetries and , somewhat confusingly , we sometimes use the algebra notation to denote the corresponding groups .    in this section",
    "we give the standard definitions of some lie algebra objects that will be useful in the subsequent discussion .      the lie algebra @xmath19 is related to its lie group @xmath20 by the exponential map @xmath21 ; i.e.  @xmath22 for any element @xmath23 .",
    "this defines it as a representation of its lie group .",
    "that is , it is a homomorphism from @xmath20 to the group of automorphisms of the tangent space of @xmath20 at the identity , @xmath24 @xcite . it comes equipped with a _ lie bracket _ , defined as = f^ab_c t^c , where @xmath25 are the lie algebra generators and @xmath26 are structure constants .",
    "this bracket is a kind of product structure , a bilinear form mapping any two elements in @xmath19 to a third . as such it is used to construct the _ adjoint representation _ of the group @xmath20 , defined as @xmath27 , \\quad\\quad x , y \\in \\lieg.\\ ] ]    the lie bracket in principle defines the whole , rather rich , structure of the algebra . in particular , it defines the _ roots _ , which are eigenvalues of @xmath28 , with @xmath29 any element in the _ cartan subalgebra _ @xmath30 . by a cartan subalgebra",
    "we mean a maximal abelian subalgebra such that the maps @xmath31 can be simultaneously diagonalised for all @xmath32 .",
    "there are two types of roots , positive and negative , which we denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ; they are simply related by @xmath35 .",
    "any root can be expressed as a linear combination of a number of _ simple roots _ with integer coefficients .",
    "positive roots are written with positive coefficients and negative roots with negative coefficients in their simple - root - decomposition .",
    "the number of simple roots is equal to the rank of the lie algebra ; for instance , @xmath9 has eight simple roots .",
    "roots satisfy a number of conditions which may be used to derive the full set of positive roots @xcite .",
    "as this was exploited in paper  i for the @xmath9 roots , we will demonstrate the procedure for that particular case here , but first we need to define another crucial ingredient in the lie algebra setup , the _ cartan matrix_. this is essentially a matrix of inner products between simple roots .",
    "more precisely , the entries of the cartan matrix @xmath36 associated with the lie algebra @xmath19 are defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the simple roots , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the inner product on @xmath19 .",
    "the diagonal elements are always equal to 2 , while the off - diagonal elements are either zero or negative .",
    "for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 to find the full set of ( positive ) roots , we first choose a root @xmath43 such that @xmath44 then the root properties imply that @xmath45 is another positive root .",
    "next , we take the inner product of this new root with each of the simple roots to see which one gives a positive result , @xmath46 thus the next positive root is obtained as @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "one can show that the resulting set of roots from this algorithm is the full set @xcite ; for @xmath9 we find 120 positive roots .",
    "the reader may notice that we are dealing with _",
    "weights _ rather than roots in paper  i. the reason the above procedure is still applicable is as follows .",
    "corresponding to each representation @xmath48 of a lie algebra @xmath19 , there is a set of weights , the eigenvalues of @xmath49 in this representation . if @xmath50 is the adjoint representation @xmath28 , then the weights are precisely the roots of the lie algebra . and",
    "since the fundamental representation of @xmath9 is the same as the adjoint one , finding the weights of the fundamental representation is in fact equivalent to finding the roots of @xmath9 .",
    "all the structure and properties of any simple lie algebra can be encoded in a simple graph called a _",
    "dynkin diagram_. such a diagram consists of a number of nodes linked by edges .",
    "each node corresponds to a simple root , and the number of edges between each pair of nodes reflects the value of the inner product between those two simple roots .",
    "there is a direct relation between the entries of the cartan matrix and the number of edges @xmath51 between the simple roots @xmath38 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this kind of diagram is very powerful as an algebra representation because , given a dynkin diagram , you can recover the whole structure of the corresponding lie algebra .",
    "the @xmath9 dynkin diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ e8dynkin ] .",
    "yang - mills theory is essentially a synonym for nonabelian gauge theory .",
    "that is , it is a field theory that is invariant under local ( or gauge ) transformations , i.e.  spacetime dependent transformations , which form a nonabelian group . in four dimensions",
    "such a theory can be used to describe three of the four forces of nature at low energy .",
    "when the theory has gauge symmetry group @xmath55 , it describes the strong interactions and is known as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "for @xmath56 it unifies electromagnetic and weak interactions in the electroweak theory .",
    "together , qcd and the electroweak theory constitute the standard model , which to date reproduces all known experimental results of particle physics .",
    "a gauge theory may possess other symmetries in addition to the gauge symmetry .",
    "for example there may be a global symmetry group ; that is , the theory is invariant under some group of spacetime independent transformations .",
    "the intuitive physical picture of such a global symmetry is as a symmetry acting on added matter , for instance a number of quarks in qcd .",
    "another symmetry example is supersymmetry , i.e.  a symmetry between bosons and fermions such that every boson is matched by a fermion ( a `` superpartner '' ) with equal mass and charge .",
    "it may seem unmotivated to introduce such a symmetry , since in experiments we have seen neither spin-0 particles with the mass of an electron , nor massless spin-@xmath57 particles ( `` photinos '' ) .",
    "but the idea is that the low - energy world we live in has spontaneously broken supersymmetry , while at sufficiently high energy we would see the supersymmetry manifest .",
    "one promising clue that this might be the case comes from the standard model coupling constants .",
    "the theoretical prediction is that , without supersymmetry , they all are almost , but not quite , equal , at around @xmath58 gev , whereas inclusion of supersymmetry makes them exactly identical , at an energy of around @xmath59 gev .    if a nonabelian gauge theory is supersymmetric , it is called super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory . such a theory is also invariant under so - called _ r - symmetry _ , which is essentially the symmetry group transforming the different supersymmetry generators into each other .",
    "we now define the precise type of sym theories that interest us , before embarking on an analysis of their vacuum states .",
    "there are several parameters we need to specify in order to define which particular type of sym theory that we are interested in .",
    "first , sym theory can be defined in any dimension up to ten ( see @xcite , appendix  b ) , but the case relevant to us is the four - dimensional one ( as the low - energy effective action on a d3-brane ) .",
    "we also need to specify the number of supersymmetries , @xmath2 .",
    "although the worldvolume theory in paper  i a priori has @xmath2=@xmath60 ( see @xcite , chapter  13 ) , this supersymmetry is partially broken by putting the branes on an orbifold singularity , and we end up with @xmath2=2 .",
    "so we focus here on @xmath2=2 sym theory .",
    "the next thing to specify is the field content .",
    "[ [ field - content ] ] field content + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a sym theory contains a number of massless multiplets ; the larger , massive multiplets can always be decomposed into these .",
    "the relevant multiplet in `` pure '' @xmath61=@xmath62 sym theory ( i.e.  there are only gauge field interactions in the theory , and no matter added by hand ) is a vector multiplet containing gauge fields @xmath63 ( @xmath64 labels the gauge group generators ) , two spinors @xmath65 and @xmath66 , a complex scalar @xmath67 and a real auxiliary field @xmath68 ( see @xcite , appendix  b.2 ) .",
    "all these fields transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "this means that , under a transformation by an element @xmath69 of the gauge group , a field @xmath70 transforms as @xmath71 on the other hand , it is said to transform in the _ fundamental _ representation if it transforms as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath70 .",
    "finally , @xmath70 is said to transform in the _ antifundamental _ representation of @xmath20 if it transforms as @xmath74 sometimes the representations are denoted by fat numbers , so that a field transforming in the fundamental representation of , say , @xmath75 , is said to transform as @xmath76 ( 3 is the dimension of this representation ) .",
    "the antifundamental analogue is @xmath77 .",
    "note that a field transforming in both @xmath76 and @xmath77 of @xmath75 by definition transforms in the adjoint .",
    "moreover , if a field transforms under a product of groups , say @xmath78 , as @xmath79 , then we call it a _ bifundamental _ field",
    ". this notation will be relevant when we discuss quiver gauge theories in section  [ quiver ] .",
    "we now add some fundamental matter to our pure @xmath2=2 sym theory .",
    "more precisely , we introduce two _ hypermultiplets _ , each of which consists of a complex scalar field @xmath80 ( @xmath81 labels the two hypermultiplets ) , a spinor @xmath82 and a complex auxiliary field is called an auxiliary field because it has no kinetic energy term .",
    "that is , its equations of motion are purely algebraic and it can be expressed in terms of other dynamical fields . ] @xmath83 , and they all transform in the fundamental representation of the gauge group .      due to the shape of the potential in @xmath2=2 sym theory , the gauge symmetry may be _",
    "spontaneously broken_. this happens because , instead of a unique vacuum with zero energy , there is a whole family of vacua . rather than being individually invariant under gauge symmetry transformations ,",
    "these vacua are transformed into each other .",
    "the physical system will spontaneously choose one of the vacua , thus breaking the gauge symmetry .",
    "this process goes by the name _",

    "an example is the _",

    "the appearance of singularities on the moduli space is due to the way we discard massive fields in the low - energy effective theory of the higgs fields .",
    "one can show that , if the gauge - fixed scalars ( the higgs fields ) are inserted into the sym action , most of the gauge fields acquire masses proportional to the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields @xcite , in analogy with the bosonic case .",
    "these gauge fields may then be neglected in the low - energy effective theory describing the gauge - fixed ( massless ) scalars ; we say that the gauge bosons have been `` higgsed away . ''",
    "the fact that the gauge - fixed theory includes only the massless fields in the bulk ( away from the origin of the moduli space ) means that the moduli space contains a singularity at the origin .",
    "the reason is that , as the higgs masses ( the vacuum expectation values ) approach zero , the formerly massive fields become massless , and thus become relevant in the theory . therefore the low - energy effective bulk theory can not be accurate near the origin .",
    "this is true classically for both branches ; there is a singularity at the origin of the higgs branch which coincides with the singularity at the origin of the coulomb branch .",
    "however , when we pass to the quantum level , the singularity of the coulomb branch splits into several separate singularities depending on the gauge group @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of the quantum singularities is not as straightforward as in the classical case ( gauge bosons becoming massless ) , but for @xmath3 sym it was shown in @xcite that two singularities arise on the coulomb branch , and that they correspond to a pair of dyons ( bound states of electric and magnetic charges ) becoming massless ( see also @xcite ) . due to @xmath2=2 supersymmetry",
    ", the higgs branch receives no quantum corrections @xcite .      continuing our investigation of the vacuum moduli space , it remains to see what happens when all of the fi - terms @xmath136 are nonzero and generic . in this case",
    "the full potential ( [ sympot ] ) can vanish only if all the vector multiplets @xmath67 are zero , which leaves only the last term , involving the moment map .",
    "the vanishing of this term is commonly referred to as the _ d - flatness _ condition . since @xmath137",
    ", we again get a higgs branch , except this time it looks a little bit different .",
    "it is again an orbifold , but with its singularity resolved , or `` blown up . '' in geometric terms , this blow - up is done essentially by replacing the singularity with a connected union of intersecting two - spheres ( two - cycles ) , and the fi - terms parameterise the size of these spheres @xcite .",
    "the resulting smooth space is then a true hyperkhler manifold , called an asymptotically locally euclidean ( ale ) space .",
    "the fi - terms are in fact the _ periods _ of the hyperkhler structures .",
    "this means that , if we represent the latter as a triplet of two - forms comprising one khler form @xmath138 and two complex forms @xmath139 and @xmath140 , then they are related to the triplet of fi - parameters as @xcite @xmath141 here @xmath142 is one of the two - cycles used to blow up the singularity .",
    "because of this relation we see that the moment maps @xmath117 play a crucial role in resolving the higgs branch singularity , via the d - flatness condition @xcite .",
    "we summarise the moduli space in table  [ t : branches ] .    .",
    "the two vacuum moduli branches obtained by setting the potential ( [ sympot ] ) to zero . for zero fi - terms the higgs branch is an orbifold @xmath134 , whereas generic fi - terms resolve the singularity to yield an ale space . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     strictly speaking there is also the possibility of having only some of the @xmath136 vanish while the rest take generic values .",
    "then a zero potential does allow both @xmath122 and @xmath125 simultaneously , for some combination of @xmath64 s and @xmath143 s @xcite .",
    "the resulting moduli space is then mixed , i.e.  a direct product of the coulomb and higgs branches .",

    "each point on the coulomb branch corresponds to a specific value of the coupling constant , and therefore to a torus of specific dimensions .",

    "in addition there are seven singularities at finite values of @xmath145 , of types @xmath153 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath148 approaches one of the singularities on the coulomb branch the torus fibre degenerates in a specific way depending on the singularity type .",
    "for instance , if the singularity is of type @xmath14 , the torus is `` pinched '' in @xmath154 places so that it becomes a necklace of two - spheres joined at points , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ necklace ] .",
    "this singular hypersurface is then described by ( [ genccurve ] ) for some specific polynomials @xmath149 and @xmath69 ; for @xmath5 , for instance , @xmath149 goes to zero and @xmath155 , so that the algebraic variety becomes @xmath156 .",
    "this ade classification of the fibration ( [ genccurve ] ) is a purely mathematical result , but due to the interpretation of the torus modulus @xmath145 as a coupling constant , it has inspired a line of physics investigations that has proved very fruitful .",
    "the idea is that each of the singularities listed above corresponds to a four - dimensional @xmath2=2 sym theory with _ global _ symmetry corresponding to the singularity type . in particular ,",
    "the interesting theories are the ones at strong coupling , i.e.  at the seven singularities at finite @xmath145 ( i m @xmath157 corresponds to weak coupling ) .",
    "for instance , the original seiberg - witten theory , i.e.  @xmath2=2 sym with @xmath3 gauge group and four hypermultiplets ( which has @xmath158 global symmetry ) , fits nicely in this picture as the strongly coupled theory at the @xmath6 singularity .",
    "the @xmath153 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 theories ( i.e.  they have global symmetries @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) are obtained as certain limits of an @xmath3 gauge theory with respectively one , two and three hypermultiplets @xcite ; these theories can be derived from the @xmath6 theory .",
    "the success of this correspondence thus far then prompted the corresponding computation for the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 theories , i.e.  theories with exceptional global symmetries @xcite .",

    "take the two - dimensional base space to be @xmath129 , parameterised by the complex coordinate @xmath148 .",
    "then the k3 manifold is described by an algebraic variety of the form ( [ genccurve ] ) with @xmath149 and @xmath69 being of degree eight and twelve respectively in @xmath148 , and it has 24 singularities .",

    "which particular gauge group we get depends on the number and types of 7-branes involved @xcite ; the different possibilities include the ade groups and were categorised in @xcite .",
    "next we do what banks et al @xcite did and introduce a d3-brane parallel to the 7-branes and located close to their position in @xmath129 .",
    "this `` probe technique '' is a popular approach to studying the properties of string theory backgrounds ; by `` probe '' we mean that the d3-brane does not itself affect the background geometry .",
    "this is admittedly an approximation , and backreaction has been taken into account in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the probe provides an alternative picture of some of the physics on the 7-branes , as features of the worldvolume theory living on the d3-brane .",
    "this is a four - dimensional @xmath2=2 sym theory with a broken gauge symmetry that becomes enhanced at the singularity .",
    "here it also becomes superconformal , and acquires a global symmetry which is the same as the gauge symmetry on the 7-branes global symmetry , this theory does not admit a lagrangian description . ]",
    "@xcite . moreover , the hypermultiplet fields are strings stretched between the d3-brane and the various 7-branes , whereas the vector multiplets correspond to strings with both ends on the d3-brane .    we have thus constructed a somewhat elaborate string theory setup in order to obtain a brane interpretation of the globally symmetric , superconformal theory .",
    "but it was worth the effort ; we now have a clear picture of the generalised coulomb branch in terms of f - theory  it is just the k3 manifold on which the twelve - dimensional theory is compactified ( the ordinary coulomb branch of the probe is the base space @xmath129 ) .",
    "in particular this has made it possible to find the exact moduli space for strongly coupled sw - theories @xcite .    moreover , this setup is relevant here because now we have brane pictures for both of the two gauge theories that paper  i relates to .",
    "the other theory , the _ quiver gauge theory _ , which has a more straightforward brane interpretation , is discussed in the next section .",
    "but first we remark that since , as was shown in @xcite and paper  i , there is a nontrivial identity between the moduli spaces of these two different theories , we expect there to be some kind of duality between the two string theory backgrounds . however , this turns out to be less than manifest , and attempts at finding such a duality have failed thus far ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us now explain what we mean by a quiver theory .",
    "quiver gauge theory is a well - established concept that frequently crops up in string theory @xcite . at first sight",
    "this type of theory may seem anything but natural , as it involves a rather specific gauge structure  a product of unitary groups and matter fields transforming according to a strict pattern as bifundamentals under pairs of the constituent gauge groups .",
    "however , in the quest for realistic physics based on string theory one must break both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry in some way , and one of the most straightforward procedures yields precisely what we call quiver theory .",
    "the idea is to start with type iib string theory in ten flat dimensions ( coordinates @xmath165 ) and introduce a stack of @xmath166 coinciding d3-branes .",
    "we arrange these branes such that their four - dimensional worldvolumes are aligned with the 0 - 1 - 2 - 3-directions @xmath167 .",
    "the worldvolume supports a pure @xmath2=@xmath60 sym theory , i.e.  the only matter present is a vector multiplet containing three complex (= six real ) scalar fields transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group . in the string theory picture",
    "these scalars are the coordinates of the position of the branes along the six dimensions transverse to the branes . as long as they all coincide",
    ", the gauge symmetry is @xmath168 ; this is due to the way in which the ends of open strings are indexed ( by _ chan - paton indices _ ) according to which branes in the stack they are attached to ( see @xcite , section  6.5 ) .",
    "however , if the branes separate from each other , the gauge group is broken down to some subgroup , since there will be fewer branes for massless strings to end on .",
    "this is precisely the higgs mechanism from the point of view of the gauge theory ; moving the branes corresponds to giving expectation values to the scalar fields , which breaks the gauge symmetry .    to break supersymmetry",
    "we make an orbifold out of the 6 - 7 - 8 - 9-dimensions by imposing an identification on the coordinates under a group @xmath135 .",
    "that is , two points are considered identical if they differ only by a @xmath135-transformation .",
    "note that the origin @xmath169 is fixed under @xmath135-transformations  this is the orbifold singularity , which will be blown up later .    here",
    "we choose @xmath135 to be a discrete subgroup of @xmath3 ; the motivation for this is that the resulting orbifold @xmath134 follows the same ade classification as a k3 surface , and may be viewed as a local description of a k3 singularity , at least near the origin .",
    "as will become clear presently , this orbifold constitutes the higgs branch of the worldvolume theory , and as we mentioned in section  [ yangmills ] it is required by @xmath2=2 supersymmetry to be just such an orbifold .",
    "to summarise , we have the following configuration , @xmath170 where crosses indicate the dimensions along which the brane or orbifold extends , and a dot means the brane is pointlike in that direction .",
    "we now explore the consequences of the @xmath135-identification .",
    "when we perform the orbifolding , the @xmath168 gauge group breaks down to a product of unitary groups , which we call @xmath171 .",
    "one of the @xmath2=@xmath60 complex scalars remains in the adjoint representation of the broken gauge group .",
    "the other two scalars on the other hand transform as bifundamentals according to a special pattern .",
    "this rearrangement of the matter fields breaks the supersymmetry down to @xmath2=2 ; the adjoint scalar becomes the scalar in the @xmath2=2 vector multiplet , while the two bifundamentals constitute the scalars of two hypermultiplets .",
    "thus the worldvolume theory on the branes is now an @xmath2=2 sym theory with two hypermultiplets .",
    "it is easy to see explicitly how the orbifolding acts on the gauge group and the scalars .",
    "a detailed account of the orbifolding procedure is given in @xcite , and we merely sketch it here . the fields that we are interested in , namely the vector fields @xmath63 ( @xmath64 labels the gauge group generators ) , the complex 4 - 5-coordinate @xmath172 , and the complex 6 - 7 - 8 - 9-coordinates @xmath173 and @xmath174 , all arise as massless excitations of open strings .",
    "we can therefore represent them by matrices encoding their chan - paton indices . with @xmath166 branes present , these matrices have dimension @xmath175 with , in a suitable basis , the ( @xmath143,@xmath176 ) entry specifying whether or not the string stretches between the @xmath143:th and @xmath176:th branes .",
    "here we take the number of branes to equal the order of the orbifold group , @xmath177 .",
    "although the reason for this choice will become clear later , we attempt to justify it already at this point . our aim is to represent the action of @xmath135 on the open string sector , and since there are @xmath178 distinct elements of the orbifold group , we need @xmath178 different string states to represent them . therefore the strings need to be able to end on @xmath178 different branes ; these string states provide a faithful representation of @xmath135 .",
    "we use the following notation for the chan - paton matrices , a^a _ & & ^a_v , + & & _ i , + ^1 & & ^1_ii , + ^2 & & ^2_ii . in the unorbifolded theory ,",
    "all these fields belong to the vector multiplet and therefore transform in the adjoint representation of the unbroken gauge group @xmath179",
    ". however , the requirement that they be invariant under the orbifold group @xmath135 imposes restrictions on the chan - paton matrices such that this is no longer true .",
    "if we denote by @xmath180 the regular matrix representation is the representation corresponding to the left action of @xmath20 on itself . in matrix form",
    "it is a @xmath181@xmath120@xmath181 block - diagonal matrix with each @xmath110-dimensional irreducible representation occurring @xmath110 times on the diagonal .",
    "] of @xmath135 , then a field is @xmath135-invariant if it commutes with @xmath180 .",
    "we therefore impose ^a_v & = & _ ^a_v ^-1 _ , [ lambdav ] + _ i & = & _ _ i ^-1_. for @xmath85 , however , we need to take into account the fact that they live along the orbifold directions .",
    "this means that the invariance condition involves an extra @xmath135-action on the doublet ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) , via the 2@xmath1202 matrix representation acting on the quaternion ( [ phidef ] ) .",
    "we call this matrix @xmath184 , and find the following invariance condition for @xmath80 , ^i_ii = ( g_)^i_j _ ^j_ii ^-1_. it is now a matter of straightforward matrix algebra to derive the form of the chan - paton matrices that satisfy eqs.([lambdav])([lambdaii ] ) , and the result is the aforementioned factorisation of the gauge group and the bifundamental structure .",
    "some explicit such calculations are shown in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "note that the vacuum moduli space now consists of two branches , as expected of a four - dimensional @xmath2=2 theory .",
    "the 4 - 5-space , induced by the vector multiplet @xmath185 , constitutes the coulomb branch , and the orbifolded 6 - 7 - 8 - 9-space , induced by the hypermultiplets @xmath80 , is the higgs branch .",
    "so what about the fayet - iliopoulos terms ? to find the corresponding object in the string theory picture it is not sufficient to look only at the open string sector .",
    "we need to include massless closed strings , in particular the _ twisted _ ones .",
    "that is , string states that are invariant under the orbifold group only as long as they stay at the singularity .",
    "these states enter the worldvolume theory of the d3-branes in exactly the same way as fi - terms @xcite .",
    "the resulting gauge structure has the interesting feature that it falls into an ade classification .",
    "that is , one may use the ade ( extended ) dynkin diagrams to encode the transformation properties of the bifundamentals . as explained above , these properties",
    "are directly related to the group @xmath135 .",
    "for instance , @xmath186 breaks the gauge group down to a direct product of @xmath133 @xmath98 s and arranges the hypermultiplets to transform as ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 ) under pairs of @xmath98 s according to an @xmath189 pattern .",
    "that is , we may represent the gauge structure by means of an @xmath189 extended dynkin diagram , as shown in fig .  [ anquiver ] .",
    "the nodes of the diagram each corresponds to a @xmath98 factor ( i.e.  a fi - term ) and the edges describe the bifundamentals with the arrow pointing towards the antifundamental representation .",
    "similarly , for @xmath135 equal to the dihedral group @xmath190 , we obtain a @xmath191 structure , and @xmath192 , the tetrahedral group , yields an @xmath7 structure .",
    "the octahedral group , @xmath193 , gives @xmath8 , and the icosahedral @xmath194 an @xmath9 structure .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the discrete groups @xmath135 and the ade lie algebras .    that the quiver diagrams are _ extended _",
    "dynkin diagrams means that there is an extra @xmath98 node compared to the ordinary dynkin diagram .",
    "this extra @xmath98 factor comes from the fact that there is a trivial solution of ( [ lambdav ] ) , namely @xmath195 , the identity matrix ; the trivial solution corresponds to a @xmath98 that will always remain unbroken no matter what we do to the branes . in terms of the worldvolume gauge theory this means we can higgs away all the vector multiplets except the one corresponding to the trivial @xmath98 .",
    "this @xmath98 group is the gauge group in the worldvolume theory of a single d - brane , so we see that the hypermultiplets now parameterise the position in the orbifold of a single d3-brane . from the point of view of the covering space @xmath196 ,",
    "this brane is actually a stack of @xmath178 _ fractional _ branes , moving simultaneously in such a way that they are images of each other under @xmath135 .",
    "the object of paper  i was to show that the higgs branch of the @xmath9 quiver theory is identical to the generalised coulomb branch of @xmath9 seiberg - witten theory .",
    "there is no problem to do this in the singular limit ; then the quiver higgs branch is just the orbifold @xmath197 , which is described essentially by eq .",
    "( [ genccurve ] ) with @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the subtle difference is that the variables @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are @xmath171-invariants here , not @xmath200-invariants , although they are isomorphic to the latter @xcite . to make the distinction explicit",
    ", we call the @xmath171-invariants @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , and find the variety @xcite @xmath204 for the @xmath9 quiver higgs branch .    for nonsingular moduli spaces matters are more involved .",

    "( [ genccurve ] ) , with @xcite f(z ) & = & w_2 z^3 + w_8 z^2 + w_14 z + w_20 [ e8f ] + g(z ) & = & z^5 + w_12 z^3 + w_18 z^2 + w_24 z + w_30 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath205 are deformation parameters ; when they are nonzero , the singularity is deformed so that the space becomes smooth .    however , we did not know the explicit form of the resolved quiver higgs branch ( the ale space ) , so we computed it in paper  i , in terms of fi - parameters .",
    "the resulting variety was then brought , by means of variable substitutions , to the form ( [ genccurve ] ) with @xmath149 and @xmath69 given by ( [ e8f ] ) and ( [ e8 g ] ) , except the coefficients in @xmath149 and @xmath69 , which we called @xmath206 , were now explicit polynomials in fi - terms .",
    "these polynomials may a priori be different from the deformation parameters of the sw - theory , and the conclusion in paper  i was that they are in fact identical .    before concluding this chapter , we briefly remark on the details of the higgs branch computation and comparison to the sw - variety .      to compute the higgs branch we used so - called `` bug calculus , '' introduced in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is essentially a technique to avoid writing zillions of indices in computations that involve a lot of fields .",
    "polynomials in the ade bifundamentals are represented by lines drawn in quiver diagrams , and traces ( invariants ) correspond to closed loops .",
    "these loops may then be manipulated subject to a set of constraints that reflect the d - flatness conditions ( i.e.  the moment map constraints ) , and we thus find the algebraic variety for the quiver higgs branch .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath9 quiver higgs branch and the @xmath9 sw - variety boils down to showing that our coefficients @xmath206 are equal to the deformation parameters @xmath205 of noguchi et al @xcite .",
    "the link between the two notations goes via the simple roots . to see how",
    ", we introduce the _ characteristic polynomial _",
    ", @xmath207 where @xmath208 is some representation of the group @xmath20 , @xmath209 is a complex parameter , and @xmath210 are the weights of the representation @xmath208 .",
    "the matrix @xmath211 is the matrix with the weights on the diagonal and zeros otherwise , and @xmath212 is the identity matrix .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath213 encodes the same information about the singularity in an elliptic fibration as the hypersurface ( [ genccurve ] ) @xcite .    in particular , it is convenient to use the characteristic polynomial for computing the casimir invariants of @xmath20 , and this is what noguchi et al @xcite did to express the @xmath9 casimir invariants (= elements of @xmath9 that commute with all generators ) in terms of the deformation parameters @xmath205 .",
    "their equations are easily inverted so as to express the @xmath205 s in terms of casimirs , which in turn are polynomials in the weights @xmath210 . and",
    "since the weights may be written in terms of the simple roots as shown in section  [ liealg ] , we obtain the casimirs as polynomials in the simple roots .",
    "we thus have the @xmath205 s expressed in terms of fi - parameters , hence they may be explicitly compared with our coefficients @xmath206 ( which were defined as polynomials in fi - terms already from the beginning ) .",
    "this chapter is concerned with the dynamics of the ends of open superstrings . as an open string propagates through spacetime it sweeps out a two - dimensional _ worldsheet_. the ends of the string trace out one - dimensional paths , which constitute boundaries of the worldsheet .",
    "the motion of the string , and hence the shape of its worldsheet , is dictated by equations of motion derived from a two - dimensional field theory called the _ nonlinear sigma model_. it is an action integral whose domain is the worldsheet , parameterised by two coordinates : @xmath214 along the string , and a time coordinate @xmath145 along the direction of motion .",
    "the _ target space _ of this integral is spacetime ; that is , the dynamical fields in the action are the vectors @xmath215 , giving the position in spacetime of the worldsheet point @xmath216 .",
    "thus the dynamics of the string is described by the equations of motion for @xmath217 .    in particular , the end of the string moves according to the equations of motion on the domain boundary ( boundary conditions ) , which restrict it to move on some hypersurface in spacetime .",
    "since open strings are by definition attached to d - branes , this hypersurface is a d - brane .",
    "thus , in defining the hypersurface where the end is allowed to move , the boundary equations of motion are telling us what the corresponding d - brane looks like , see fig .",
    "[ worldsheet ] .",
    "how restrictive these equations of motion are depends on the amount of symmetry preserved on the boundary .",
    "we focus here on the minimally ( @xmath2=1 ) supersymmetric conformal nonlinear sigma model,=2 model . in this case",
    "a rich structure arises due to an ambiguity in choice of sign in the boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath2=2 model was studied in more detail in @xcite . ] assuming that the worldsheet bulk superconformal symmetry is preserved also on the boundary ( the d - brane ) .",
    "we showed in papers  ii  iv that the boundary conditions allowed by this assumption are more general than those commonly used elsewhere  the latter conditions are just special cases . nevertheless , we will see that our conditions do impose some restrictions on the properties of d - branes .    in deriving the boundary equations of motion",
    ", the naive approach would be to do so directly from the action , by use of the principle of least action ( i.e.  a perturbation of the action should vanish ) .",
    "this is hazardous , as the result does not necessarily preserve the desired symmetries .",
    "one could in principle amend this by modifying the action by extra boundary terms to make it superconformal on the boundary .",
    "however , there is no systematic way to find those boundary terms , except guessing them . in papers",
    "ii and iii we therefore went for the safer method of analysing the currents that correspond to the relevant symmetries , requiring that they be conserved on the boundary .",
    "this defines boundary conditions for the currents , from which we could derive conditions on the brane .",
    "having thus obtained the minimal requirements for boundary superconformal invariance in a general background , it is natural to consider a special case of background . in paper",
    "iv we chose the ever popular _ wzw model _ , which is a nonlinear sigma model defined on a group manifold , with chiral isometry currents @xcite . here",
    "our boundary conditions imply a surprisingly general gluing map between the isometry currents , the geometrical implications of which remain unclear at the time of writing .",
    "to introduce some fundamental concepts pertaining to symmetries and conserved currents , we begin in section  [ bosonic ] by discussing the bosonic nonlinear sigma model . then we define the supersymmetric sigma model in section  [ superspace ] , explaining about superspace and superfields , and how to derive the superconformal currents . in section  [ ansatz ]",
    "we make an ansatz for the worldsheet fields which , after introducing some necessary notation in section  [ structures ] , we plug into the conservation laws for the currents and obtain in section  [ bcs ] the complete set of conditions for a superconformal d - brane , which we interpret in geometrical terms . prompted by similarities to the structures of _ almost product manifolds _ , we look at globally defined boundary conditions in section  [ global ] , drawing some conclusions about the global embedding of d - branes in spacetime . finally in section  [ wzw ]",
    "we apply our analysis to the wzw model , leading to some interesting statements about gluing maps of group currents .",
    "consider an open string of tension @xmath218 propagating on a spacetime manifold that supports a general background two - tensor @xmath219 . here",
    "@xmath220 is the spacetime metric and @xmath221 an antisymmetric b - field , both of which may depend on the spacetime coordinates @xmath217 . then the nonlinear sigma model for the string is ( see @xcite , section  3.4 ) s & = & - dd , where @xmath222 is the metric on the worldsheet , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 is the worldsheet antisymmetric tensor with @xmath225=@xmath226=1 and @xmath227=0 .",
    "one may derive equations of motion for the string by varying ( [ sigmabos ] ) with respect to @xmath217 .",
    "since the string is open , the domain of the integral has boundaries , which contribute boundary terms to the equations of motion .",
    "the dynamics of the ends of the string is then determined by the vanishing of these boundary terms , implying some nontrivial boundary conditions for the open string .",
    "the boundary conditions are of two types ; either the string is moving freely along the @xmath217-direction  _ neumann _ conditions  or it is stuck in that direction  _ dirichlet _ conditions .",
    "the hypersurface to which the string s endpoint is confined , i.e.  the d - brane , thus extends along neumann directions and is pointlike in dirichlet directions ( see @xcite , chapter  8) .",
    "however , the boundary equations of motion obtained in this way do not necessarily preserve all the symmetries that are preserved in the bulk .",
    "if our prime concern is that they do ( which it is ) , then we are better off analysing _ conserved currents_.      the model ( [ sigmabos ] ) is invariant under three different symmetries : spacetime poincar transformations , worldsheet conformal transformations ( rescaling of the two - dimensional metric @xmath222 ) , and worldsheet reparameterisation . the last symmetry allows us to switch to _ lightcone _ coordinates on the worldsheet , @xmath228 , and we use this basis henceforth .",
    "each symmetry corresponds to a conserved current , obtained by varying the action with respect to the appropriate field .",
    "the requirement that the action be invariant under this perturbation ( in the bulk ) translates into a conservation law saying that the current is divergence - free , i.e.   there are no sources .",
    "for example in the case of conformal invariance , the corresponding current is the stress energy - momentum tensor and is derived by varying ( [ sigmabos ] ) with respect to @xmath222 .",
    "its components in lightcone coordinates are t _ = _ x^ _ x^g _ , where @xmath229 are the derivatives with respect to @xmath230 , and we have rescaled the tension to one .",
    "the @xmath231 component depends only on @xmath232 , and is called the `` left - moving '' current , whereas @xmath233 depends only on @xmath234 and is referred to as `` right - moving . '' here the bulk conservation law takes the form @xmath235 .",
    "to ensure that also the boundary is conformally invariant , we need to impose current conservation on the boundary separately .",
    "in general we find the boundary condition for a given current @xmath236 by using its associated charge @xmath237 .",
    "this charge is conserved in the sense that it is time - independent , @xmath238 ( see @xcite , section  3.2 ) .",
    "thus , since @xmath236 obeys the conservation law @xmath239 , we may write charge conservation as 0=_q_b = d _",
    "j^_b = - d _",
    "j^_b = - [ j^_b ] ^=_=0 .",
    "hence we obtain the boundary condition @xmath240 , for @xmath241 . applied to the stress tensor ,",
    "the result is t_++ - t_ = 0 , i.e.  the left- and right - moving components of the stress tensor must be equal . via the relation ( [ tbos ] ) between the stress tensor and the worldsheet fields , we thus find a boundary condition relating the left - moving fields @xmath242 to the right - moving fields @xmath243 .",
    "the bosonic model ( [ sigmabos ] ) has only the three symmetries listed in section  [ bosonic ] .",
    "if we want more symmetry the action needs to be modified . in particular , to make it supersymmetric we have to add superpartner fields that together with the bosonic worldsheet scalars @xmath217 make up multiplets ( cf .  section  [ yangmills ] ) .",
    "we thus add two worldsheet spinors @xmath244 and an auxiliary ( i.e.  nondynamical ) field @xmath245 .",
    "the fields constituting a multiplet can be conveniently collected in a single _",
    "superfield_. the idea is to promote the ordinary worldsheet to a _",
    "superspace _ by supplementing the bosonic worldsheet coordinates @xmath230 with anticommuting coordinates @xmath246 .",
    "superfields are terminating polynomials in @xmath246 , with the multiplet fields as coefficients .",
    "for example , a multiplet ( @xmath217 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 ) would correspond to the superfield @xcite @xmath247 similarly , the worldsheet derivatives @xmath229 in ( the lightcone version of ) ( [ sigmabos ] ) are extended by additional `` superderivatives '' @xmath248 , and the action becomes an integral over superspace rather than over ordinary space .",
    "superspace comes equipped with integration rules that render this integral equivalent to the ordinary one @xcite .",
    "the whole point of using superfield notation is that the supersymmetric theory can be analysed in a much more compact way than if we were to use the explicit `` component form . ''",
    "instead of writing out the kinetic terms in the action for all the multiplet fields individually , we can simply replace the bosonic fields in ( [ sigmabos ] ) with superfields .",
    "in lightcone coordinates we thus obtain s = d^2d^2d_+ ^d_- ^ _ ( ) , where @xmath249 is the superfield whose lowest component is the background tensor @xmath250 .",
    "analysis of the superspace action can then be performed in a way completely analogous to the bosonic case , using superspace quantities instead of bosonic ones .    without boundaries ,",
    "the action ( [ sigmasusy ] ) is @xmath2=(1,1 ) ( globally ) supersymmetric , i.e.  it is invariant under two independent supersymmetry transformations that transform the bosonic and fermionic fields into each other .",
    "one is parameterised by a left - moving supersymmetry parameter @xmath251 , and the other by a right - moving one , @xmath252 .",
    "these two parameters are a priori independent of each other , and each of them is associated with a conserved supersymmetry current ; we denote these currents by @xmath253 .    in the presence of a boundary",
    "the supersymmetry parameters and currents are subject to boundary conditions that relate left- and right - movers , as we saw in section  [ bosonic ] .",
    "the supersymmetry parameters become identified up to a sign , @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) , reducing the @xmath2=(1,1 ) symmetry to @xmath2=1 .",
    "for the currents the boundary condition ( [ charge ] ) is g_+-g_- = 0 , which is the condition for the boundary to preserve worldsheet supersymmetry .",
    "the condition ( [ gcond ] ) together with the stress tensor condition ( [ tbosbc ] ) define the superconformal boundary conditions for the classical open superstring .",
    "it is these two conditions that served as our starting point in papers  ii  iv . to derive the corresponding boundary conditions for the worldsheet fields we need to write the currents @xmath256 and @xmath253 in terms of @xmath217 and @xmath244 . in the bosonic theory",
    "the expression for the stress tensor was ( [ tbos ] ) ; here the relation is more complicated , involving also @xmath244 .",
    "we now briefly explain how to compute the superconformal currents from a _ locally _ supersymmetric sigma model .",
    "the conformal and supersymmetry currents can be viewed as components of a superfield which we call the `` supercurrent , '' and which we denote by @xmath257 ( the indices @xmath258 run over the superspace indices @xmath259 ) .",
    "this is a kind of stress tensor for a locally supersymmetric version of the nonlinear sigma model ( [ sigmasusy ] ) .",
    "what one does is to `` gauge '' the model by replacing the flat superderivatives @xmath260 with covariant ones , @xmath261 , as well as introducing a supervielbein @xmath262 on superspace ( see @xcite , section  4.3.4 ) .",
    "the action then becomes @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the determinant of the supervielbein .",
    "next we vary @xmath265 with respect to the vielbein components and obtain the supercurrent , of which only two components do not vanish on - shell , namely @xmath266 and @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "these are expressions in covariant superderivatives of superfields , and we revert to global supersymmetry by replacing the covariant derivatives with flat ones again .",
    "finally , we can extract the components of the supercurrent as follows , @xmath268 @xmath269 the result is a set of explicit expressions for the currents in terms of worldsheet fields , which we omit here ; they are given in paper  iii .",
    "it is now in principle straightforward to convert the boundary conditions ( [ tbosbc ] ) and ( [ gcond ] ) for the currents into boundary conditions for the fields @xmath217 and @xmath244 . we know that the boundary enforces relations between left- and right - movers , so we can make an ansatz for the way in which the left- and right - moving worldsheet fields are related to each other , and then derive restrictions on this ansatz from the current conditions .",
    "thus our plan of attack is to make the most general ansatz possible for the worldsheet fields , plug it into the current conditions , and reduce these conditions to an independent set of boundary conditions that we can interpret .",
    "it turns out that the most general , local ansatz we can make in our classical conformal theory is very simple for the fermions , due to the absence of dimensionful parameters .",
    "we therefore start with this ansatz and then derive the corresponding bosonic relation by a supersymmetry transformation .",

    "we call @xmath282 a _ dirichlet projector _ , and we can use it to write the dirichlet condition ( [ xdcond ] ) on the desired covariant form , @xmath287    similarly , we may define a _ neumann projector _",
    "@xmath288 complementary to @xmath282 , satisfying @xmath289 it projects vectors onto the tangent space of the brane ( i.e.  the neumann directions ) at any given point @xmath285 on the brane , and thus assigns to @xmath285 a vector space @xmath290 of dimension @xmath291 .",
    "the two spaces @xmath286 and @xmath290 are subspaces of the tangent plane @xmath292 of the spacetime manifold @xmath293 at the point @xmath285 , and they are orthogonal to each other .",
    "that is , any vector in @xmath286 is orthogonal to all vectors in @xmath290 with respect to the metric @xmath220 on @xmath293 .",
    "in other words , @xmath288 and @xmath282 split @xmath294 into a direct sum ( see fig .",
    "[ tm ] ) , t_u ( ) = _ u q_u .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the only assumption we make from the outset is that the target space is a smooth manifold equipped with a ( pseudo- ) riemannian metric and an antisymmetric two - tensor ( the b - field ) .",
    "a priori we do not know anything about the properties of the d - brane ; it need not be a regular submanifold of spacetime , and could be singular or ill - defined for all we know .",
    "our object is to start from this unassuming standpoint and derive the properties required of the brane by superconformal invariance .",
    "it is thus by no means certain at this point that @xmath288 defines a tangent space corresponding to a submanifold of spacetime , although the vector space @xmath290 is a subspace of @xmath294 .",
    "however , we will see in section  [ global ] that , under certain circumstances , this follows as a consequence of the superconformal boundary conditions .",
    "we need one more object before writing down the boundary conditions . given two orthogonal projectors @xmath288 and @xmath282 we may define another ( 1,1)-tensor , @xmath295 which squares to the identity , @xmath296 , since @xmath288 and @xmath282 are orthogonal and each of them squares to itself .",
    "alternatively , @xmath288 and @xmath282 can be written in terms of @xmath297 , @xmath298    the three structures @xmath288 , @xmath282 and @xmath297 , although very simple and intuitive in essence , were crucial in deriving and understanding the superconformal boundary conditions in papers  ii and iii .",
    "note that initially they are defined only at a point , the endpoint of the string .",
    "however , we will see that superconformal invariance allows us to extend them to a neighbourhood , thus providing some information about the local smoothness of the brane .",
    "in fact , we will even define them globally ( i.e.  at every point in @xmath293 ) , just to see what happens .",
    "one can then draw some conclusions about the way in which the d - brane is embedded , globally , in spacetime , rather than merely looking at a small coordinate patch of the brane .",
    "but before exploring such possibilities , let us finally write down the boundary conditions explicitly .      using the ansatz ( [ fermbc ] ) and ( [ bosbc ] ) in the current conditions ( [ tbosbc ] ) and ( [ gcond ] ) , we found in paper  iii the following three boundary conditions , & & r^ _ g _ r^ _ = g _ , [ rgr ] + & & ^ _ e _ ^",
    "_ = ^ _ e _ ^ _ r^ _ , [ br ] + & & ^ _ ^ _ _ [ q^ _ ] = 0 .",
    "we also showed that they make up a complete set , i.e.  there are no further independent conditions to be found .",
    "it may seem that these conditions are not in fact conditions on the worldsheet fields , which we claimed we were after .",
    "however , they are explicit conditions on the structures on the brane , which is equivalent to restrictions of the motion of the string endpoints .",
    "the first condition says that the boundary map @xmath271 preserves the spacetime metric .",
    "this implies that the metric diagonalises so that it consists of a neumann - neumann part and a dirichlet - dirichlet part , but has no `` mixed '' components .",
    "one may see how this happens by going to adapted coordinates ; there we have seen that @xmath271 has the diagonal form ( [ rmatrix ] ) , so it follows immediately from ( [ rgr ] ) that the metric must be block - diagonal , @xmath299 .",
    "there are two things to note here .",
    "first , the diagonal form of the metric does not necessarily imply that the two constituent blocks are completely decoupled .",
    "there may still be interdependence such that e.g.  @xmath300 depends on dirichlet coordinates .",
    "second , it is important to realise that the condition ( [ rgr ] ) is not imposing restrictions on the spacetime metric , but on the d - brane  its embedding in target space must be such that the metric diagonalises .",
    "moving on to the second boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) , we see that it is a condition on the neumann - neumann part of @xmath271 .",
    "it is essentially the definition of the b - field mentioned in section  [ ansatz ] ; in adapted coordinates it schematically looks like @xmath301 ( along the neumann - neumann directions ) . from this form",
    "we can derive the behaviour of the string for large b - field ; as we take @xmath302 , the neumann - neumann block of @xmath271 goes to @xmath303 , i.e.  we find that the neumann conditions turn into dirichlet conditions .",
    "that is , the endpoint of the string is completely frozen in all directions in this limit .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , in the limit @xmath304 , we find @xmath305 .",
    "last but not least , we want to interpret the condition ( [ integ ] ) .",
    "this is actually a precise mathematical statement saying that the projector @xmath288 is _ integrable _ @xcite .",
    "there are several ways of understanding the content of this statement @xcite , but perhaps the most intuitive one is to consider two displacements along the neumann directions .",
    "if the commutator @xmath306 x^\\mu$ ] between them vanishes , then regardless of which order we do them in , we always end up in the same point .",
    "if , on the other hand , they do not commute , the final position _ will _ depend on the order of displacement .",
    "the latter case corresponds to some singular d - brane about which we can not say much .",
    "the former situation , however , is the interesting one , because it occurs if and only if ( [ integ ] ) holds , as is easily seen by inserting @xmath307 in the commutator .",
    "it implies local smoothness at the point @xmath285 in the sense that we can extend the basis of @xmath290 to a neighbourhood of @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "in particular the adapted coordinate basis , where @xmath288 takes the form ^_= (      ) , can be extended to a neighbourhood of @xmath285 so that @xmath288 is given by ( [ pimatrix ] ) on the whole neighbourhood . were integrable too , then we would be able to extend the basis in all directions . ] and since we can define @xmath282 wherever @xmath288 is defined , and hence @xmath297 , it follows that we may extend all three of our ( 1,1)-tensors to a neighbourhood of @xmath285 .",
    "another consequence of @xmath308-integrability is that the neumann - neumann part of the metric is independent of the dirichlet directions @xcite ( though as long as @xmath282 is not integrable , the dirichlet - dirichlet part of @xmath220 may still depend on the neumann coordinates ) .",
    "this is as far as we get in our interpretation of the conditions ( [ rgr])([integ ] ) without making additional assumptions .",
    "but the properties of our structures @xmath282 , @xmath288 and @xmath297 are exactly the same as those of the structures associated with _ almost product manifolds _ @xcite , except that they are not globally defined .",
    "we therefore found it irresistible to add this extra property in papers  ii and iii , and investigate the consequences .      by `` globally defined '' we mean that our structures @xmath282 , @xmath288 and @xmath297 , as well as @xmath271 , all are defined not only at a point @xmath285 ( and , by integrability , on a neighbourhood of @xmath285 ) , but at every point @xmath309 in spacetime .",
    "in this case , @xmath288 and @xmath282 are _ distributions _ on @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "that is , they assign a space of vectors ( @xmath310 and @xmath311 , respectively ) to each point @xmath312 , thus splitting the whole tangent space @xmath313 ( not just the tangent plane at a point @xmath285 , cf .",
    "( [ tsplit ] ) ) into a direct sum , t ( ) = q .",
    "the tensor @xmath297 is now an _",
    "almost product structure _ , defining the target space as an _ almost product manifold _",
    "the word `` almost '' refers to the fact that the manifold is not necessarily a direct product , despite its tangent space being a direct sum . ) to split @xmath293 into a direct product is measured by the _ nijenhuis tensor _ @xmath314 } - r^\\gamma_{\\,\\,\\nu }    r^\\rho_{\\,\\,[\\mu,\\gamma]}$ ] @xcite .",
    "] an example of such a manifold is a locally product manifold , i.e.  a manifold that locally looks like a direct product but globally is not ( think of the mbius strip ) .",
    "let us have a fresh look at the boundary conditions ( [ rgr])([integ ] ) through our `` global glasses . ''",
    "we saw in section  [ bcs ] that the first condition implies that the metric diagonalises . in adapted",
    "coordinates it is then easily seen that the metric preserves also the almost product structure , since the latter takes the form @xmath315 in this basis .",
    "thus the spacetime manifold is an almost product manifold with a ( pseudo- ) riemannian metric that is preserved by the almost product structure ; such a manifold is called a ( pseudo- ) riemannian almost product manifold @xcite .    the second boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) , gives no new information , so we turn directly to the condition ( [ integ ] ) , which says that @xmath288 is an integrable distribution . such an object is by definition a _ foliation _",
    "this means that , at every point @xmath309 in spacetime , @xmath288 locally defines , on a neighbourhood of @xmath309 , a set of hyperplanes , or _ leaves _ , that in adapted coordinates are described by the system of equations @xmath316=",
    "constant@xmath317 @xcite .",
    "these hyperplanes are contained in the space @xmath310 , but a priori need not be of the same dimension , so they are not necessarily d - branes ( recall that @xmath288 defines the dimensionality of the d - brane ) .",
    "however , there is a theorem by frobenius saying that when @xmath288 is a foliation , then through every point @xmath312 there is a unique submanifold of @xmath293 whose tangent space is @xmath310 ( called a _",
    "maximal integral manifold _ of @xmath288 ) @xcite ; this is the d - brane we were looking for .    in conclusion , globally defined superconformal boundary conditions imply that spacetime is foliated by d - branes which are submanifolds embedded in such a way that spacetime may be viewed as a ( pseudo- ) riemannian almost product manifold .",
    "let us give some concrete examples of such d - brane embeddings .",
    "as we mentioned above , the obvious special case of an almost product manifold is a direct product , e.g.  a torus ( a direct product of one - cycles ) .",
    "thus , if spacetime were a torus , the superconformally allowed d - branes would be those that wrap one or more of the constituent one - cycles .",
    "more interestingly , many exact solutions of einstein s equations are almost product manifolds , e.g.  the schwarzschild and robertson - walker spaces .",
    "to be explicit , we take a closer look at the schwarzschild space ; it makes an instructive example of the way different d - brane embeddings determine the type of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is ds^2 = -f(r ) dt^2 + h(r ) dr^2 + r^2 d^2 , where @xmath209 is time , @xmath318 is the radial coordinate , @xmath319 with @xmath320 a constant , @xmath321 , and @xmath322 is the metric on a two - sphere . assuming that @xmath209 is the time coordinate also on the worldvolume of the d - brane ,",
    "there is only one embedding which is allowed by the superconformal boundary conditions ( [ rgr])([integ ] ) .",
    "we can write the manifold at hand as a _ warped product manifold _ @xmath323 with @xmath324 being the metric on @xmath325 and @xmath326 the metric on @xmath327 .",
    "it is called `` warped '' because the factor in front of @xmath328 ( in our case @xmath329 ) depends on the coordinates of @xmath325 .",
    "then the brane can extend along @xmath209 and @xmath318 , i.e.  we have a d1-brane that coincides with the manifold @xmath325 . here",
    "@xmath330 is the metric on the brane ; it is independent of the @xmath327-coordinates , which is consistent with integrability of @xmath288 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a problem with integrability at the singularity @xmath331 ; nevertheless , the general principle should be clear .    alternatively , we may write the metric ( [ schwarzschild ] ) as a different almost product manifold , @xmath332 with @xmath333 and @xmath334 . here",
    "we could have a d2-brane wrapping @xmath325 .",
    "however , it would not be superconformal , since @xmath288 is not integrable in this case ; the neumann - neumann metric @xmath335 depends on the dirichlet direction @xmath318 .",
    "finally , there is also the possibility of a d0-brane , extending only along @xmath209 , in which case spacetime again is a warped product manifold , with warp factor @xmath336 .",
    "also this brane breaks superconformal invariance , since the metric on the brane depends on the dirichlet directions .        in the preceding sections",
    "we have learnt the minimal requirements for a d - brane to preserve superconformal symmetry in a general spacetime .",
    "to put our boundary conditions to the test , we want to study a special case , i.e.  a string propagating on a given manifold .",
    "the most obvious choice is the extensively studied _ wzw model _ @xcite .",
    "this is a nonlinear sigma model defined on a _ group manifold _ of some lie group @xmath20 ; that is , the target space coordinates transform into each other under a group @xmath20 .",
    "the importance of this model is due to the fact that it is exactly solvable , and provides a tractable setting for studying d - branes in curved backgrounds .",
    "in particular , when @xmath20 is a semisimple lie group , the background fields simplify in such a way as to make our boundary conditions more transparent .",
    "the target space ( and the action ) is invariant under @xmath337 transformations , so there are two chiral currents ( i.e.   each current depends only on one of the worldsheet coordinates @xmath230 ) associated with this symmetry , one for each group @xmath20 . they can be derived from the superspace action ( [ sigmasusy ] ) by varying it with respect to the `` left '' and `` right '' group , respectively .",
    "the result is left- and right - moving currents , @xmath338 where @xmath339 and @xmath340 are the superfield killing vectors associated with each symmetry .",
    "we denote the lowest ( fermionic ) components of @xmath341 by j_+ j_+| = -l__+^ , j_- j_-| = r__-^ , where @xmath342 and @xmath343 are the lowest components of the superfield killing vectors .",
    "should not be confused with the almost product structure @xmath344 in section  [ global ] . ]    the vectors @xmath345 and @xmath346 can be expanded in the lie algebra basis @xmath347 of their corresponding groups , as @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath350 and @xmath351 satisfy the corresponding lie algebra , @xmath352 = -f_{ab}^{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,c } l_c , \\quad\\quad [ r_a , r_b ] = f_{ab}^{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,c } r_c\\ ] ] ( the sign is just a convention ) , and they commute with each other , @xmath353 = 0 $ ] . here",
    "the lie bracket for vectors @xmath354 is defined as @xmath355^\\mu \\equiv   v^\\nu_{\\,\\,a } \\d_{\\nu } v^\\mu_{\\,\\,b } - v^\\nu_{\\,\\,b } \\d_{\\nu } v^\\mu_{\\,\\,a}$ ] .      from ( [ jpm ] )",
    "follows immediately that the fermionic ansatz ( [ fermbc ] ) translates into a boundary condition for the group currents , @xmath356 where r^a_b -l^a _ r^ _ r^_b .",
    "the transformation in ( [ rdef ] ) is essentially a change of basis from spacetime vectors to the lie algebra basis @xcite .",
    "the object @xmath357 is a gluing map between the chiral currents at the worldsheet boundary .",
    "since it maps @xmath358 to @xmath359 , which are elements of the lie algebra , it is clearly a map from the lie algebra into itself .",
    "what more we can say about this map ? it is usually assumed in the literature to be a constant _ lie algebra automorphism _ @xcite .",
    "this means that it preserves the lie algebra structure in the sense that = f_ab^c r^f_c t_f .",
    "however , this restriction is always made for practical reasons , as a nonconstant gluing map makes the quantum theory unwieldy .",
    "and indeed we found in paper  iv that @xmath357 in the @xmath2=1 model can in principle be a much more general object .    to see how we reach this conclusion ,",
    "let us write down the boundary conditions for the wzw model .",
    "for this purpose , we take advantage of the fact that on group manifolds the metric and torsion can be expressed entirely in terms of killing vectors , lie algebra structure constants and the cartan - killing metric . ]",
    "@xmath360 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ rgr ] ) and ( [ integ ] ) can be written as equations involving only these quantities plus @xmath357 , and we end up with the following conditions , _ ab = r^c_a _ cd r^d_b , f_abc - f_def r^d_a r^e_b r^f_c = _ de r^d_[a ( _c r^e_b ] ) . here",

    "let us first use ( [ retar ] ) to manipulate the lie bracket ( [ lieaut ] ) a little .",
    "we can rewrite the left - hand side of ( [ lieaut ] ) as @xmath364   = r^d_{\\,\\,\\,a }   r^e_{\\,\\,\\,b } f_{de}^{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,f } t_f , \\ ] ] whence , using ( [ retar ] ) , follows that @xmath357 is a lie algebra automorphism if and only if @xmath365 thus we see that @xmath357 is a lie algebra automorphism if and only if the right - hand side of ( [ gcond2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "hence we draw two conclusions from ( [ gcond2 ] ) .",
    "first , @xmath357 does not have to be a lie algebra automorphism .",
    "second , it can be a lie algebra automorphism without being constant , since the right - hand side can vanish even if @xmath357 is nonconstant .",
    "the interpretation of this condition in terms of d - branes was not addressed in paper  iv , but it is known that for the special case where @xmath357 is constant , conformally invariant d - branes are obtained as conjugacy classes of the group @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "<S> the on - going quest for a single theory that describes all the forces of nature has led to the discovery of string theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only known theory that successfully unifies gravity with the electroweak and strong forces . </S>",
    "<S> it postulates that the fundamental building blocks of nature are strings , and that all particles arise as different excitations of strings . </S>",
    "<S> this theory is still poorly understood , especially at strong coupling , but progress is being made all the time . </S>",
    "<S> one breakthrough came with the discovery of extended objects called d - branes , which have proved crucial in probing the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> they are instrumental in realising dualities ( equivalences ) between different limits of string theory .    </S>",
    "<S> this thesis is concerned with dualities and d - branes . </S>",
    "<S> first , it gives a background and review of the first article , where we substantiated a conjectured duality between two a priori unrelated gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> these gauge theories have different realisations as the worldvolume theories on different d - brane configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that there is an identity between the spaces of vacua ( moduli spaces ) arising in the two theories , which suggests that the corresponding string theory pictures are dual .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we give a background and description of the analysis performed in the remaining three articles , where we derived the most general , local , superconformal boundary conditions of the two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> this model describes the dynamics of open strings , and the boundary conditions dictate the geometry of d - branes . in the last article we studied these boundary conditions for the special case of wzw models </S>"
