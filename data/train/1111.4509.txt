    "around 2007 a major breakthrough occurred in smooth @xmath1-manifold theory when several authors ( @xcite and @xcite ) produced what was then the smallest known simply connected @xmath1-manifold , @xmath0 , with more than one smooth structure .",
    "the idea of reverse engineering , as developed by the authors of this paper and presented in @xcite , is to find a symplectic model which should have the same euler characteristic and signature as the manifold to be constructed , and should contain enough disjoint lagrangian tori so that surgeries on them kill @xmath2 . in particular , for @xmath0 , we showed in 2006 that an appropriate model is @xmath3 , the symplectic square of a riemann surface of genus @xmath4 , but we never thought that the result of our surgeries could ever be simply connected .",
    "however , it turns out that the manifolds produced in @xcite and @xcite can equivalently be obtained from reverse engineering starting with @xmath3 , and , from our vantage point , proving simple connectivity was a major contribution .    pushing this",
    "further , as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , this procedure can be reinterpreted to show that surgery on nullhomologous tori is the underlying operation that is used to change the smooth structure of a @xmath1-manifold . in this paper",
    "we hope to motivate and enhance this idea by proving the following theorem .",
    "[ one ] there is a nullhomologous torus @xmath5 embedded in @xmath0 such that surgeries on @xmath5 result in an infinite family of smooth @xmath1-manifolds which are all homeomorphic to @xmath0 but which are pairwise nondiffeomorphic .",
    "this theorem is true more generally for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , following the ideas below and the constructions of @xcite .    given a general smooth @xmath1-manifold , it is not known whether it is possible to find such tori , and even if it is , they are difficult to find .",
    "we give a hint at their detection by showing below that in the case of symplectic manifolds with @xmath8 these nullhomologous tori are constrained by their relationship with the canonical class .",
    "an effective procedure for altering the smooth structure of a given 4-manifold x relies on the ability to find a suitably embedded torus @xmath5 with trivial normal bundle that represents a nontrivial homology class and to perform surgeries on this torus .",
    "if the torus @xmath5 is the fiber of an elliptic fibration , this surgery is also known as ` log transform ' .",
    "if both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are simply connected , and if the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath9 is nontrivial , then another effective surgery on @xmath5 , the knot surgery introduced in @xcite , will also change the smooth structure of @xmath9 . in each of these cases , the new smooth manifold also contains an essential torus of self - intersection @xmath11 .",
    "however , not all @xmath1-manifolds contain such suitably embedded tori . in particular",
    ", the following lemma shows that in the situation which is of particular interest to us , we can find no tori with trivial normal bundle representing a nontrivial homology class .",
    "[ null ] let @xmath9 be a smooth simply connected @xmath1-manifold with @xmath8 , @xmath12 and with a nontrivial seiberg - witten invariant",
    ". then there are no homologically essential embedded tori of square @xmath11 in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a basic class , i.e @xmath14 is the poincar dual of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a -structure for which the seiberg - witten invariant is nonzero .",
    "let @xmath17 be an orthogonal basis for @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "write @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath23 , and since the dimension of the seiberg - witten moduli space corresponding to @xmath14 is nonnegative , we also have @xmath24 , and this is @xmath25 because of our hypothesis on @xmath9 .",
    "hence @xmath26 it follows directly from the adjunction inequality that @xmath27 ; hence @xmath28 .",
    "thus cauchy - schwartz implies @xmath29 this contradiction proves the lemma .    in summary , for some manifolds , in particular the manifolds of the important class above",

    "( the situation is the same for @xmath59 surgery on @xmath50 . )",
    "the manifold @xmath9 which results from this surgery contains a torus @xmath5 of self - intersection @xmath11 , the core torus @xmath60 in the formula above .",
    "the meridional loop @xmath37 to this torus is homologous to @xmath61 , which is in turn homologous to @xmath56 , since @xmath54 is homologically trivial in @xmath62 . thus @xmath37 represents a nonzero class in @xmath63 ; so @xmath5 must be nullhomologous .",
    "the gluing takes @xmath54 to a loop @xmath48 on @xmath64 which is homotopic in @xmath30 to a loop @xmath32 on @xmath5 .",

    "conversely if we perform @xmath11-surgery on @xmath5 with respect to @xmath32 and the framing given by @xmath65 , the resultant manifold is @xmath51 .",
    "the situation is summarized in diagram .",

    "suppose we are given a manifold @xmath9 upon which we would like to do @xmath67 surgery with respect to a torus @xmath5 and a loop @xmath32 as above .",
    "the morgan - mrowka - szabo formula determines the seiberg - witten invariants of the surgered manifold @xmath68 in terms of those of @xmath9 itself and of @xmath11-surgery @xmath69 as above .",
    "we write @xmath70 for the core torus of the surgery in @xmath69 .",

    "similarly @xmath71 is the core torus in @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a basic class .",
    "the adjunction inequality implies that @xmath73 is orthogonal to @xmath70 .",

    "it follows from @xcite that @xmath78)\\ ] ] and that these comprise all the basic classes of @xmath68 .    if there is a torus @xmath79 of self - intersection @xmath11 in @xmath69 such that @xmath80 , then adjunction inequality arguments show that the sum on the right of the above formula has at most one nonzero term",
    ". we will often be in the situation where each of the manifolds @xmath9 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 has a unique basic class up to sign . in either of these cases",
    "we can unambiguously write @xmath81 .",
    "we see that if @xmath82 , we obtain an infinite family of distinct smooth manifolds ( determined by their seiberg - witten invariants ) all with the same homology groups as @xmath9 .",
    "we begin by discussing how one ensures that the term @xmath83 of is nonzero .",
    "if @xmath9 is a symplectic manifold and @xmath5 is any lagrangian torus , then there is a canonical framing , called the lagrangian framing , of @xmath44 .",

    "if one performs @xmath67 surgeries with respect to the pushoff in this framing of any curve on @xmath5 , then the result is also a symplectic manifold .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a full discussion of this phenomena , which is referred to as _",
    "luttinger surgery_. however , one must be careful that it is often the case that the pushoff of a curve using the lagrangian framing may not be nullhomologous , so that a @xmath67 ( luttinger ) surgery may in fact may change @xmath84",
    ". this will be the case when performing reverse engineering .",
    "it is important to note that surgery on tori changes neither the signature , @xmath85 nor the euler characteristic , @xmath86 , of a @xmath1-manifold @xmath9 .",
    "also , as mentioned above , if @xmath87 and @xmath5 is a nullhomologous torus with a nonseparating loop @xmath32 which is nullhomologous in @xmath88 , then a @xmath67 surgery on @xmath5 with respect to the nullhomologous framing of @xmath32 leaves @xmath89 unchanged . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath9 is simply connected , @xmath82 , and if it can also be seen that the manifolds @xmath68 are simply connected , then we obtain an infinite family of distinct manifolds all homeomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "this is the key idea of  reverse engineering \" .",
    "the method is as follows :    suppose that we wish to construct manifolds which are homeomorphic to a given simply connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath90 with @xmath91 but which are pairwise nondiffeomorphic . here is a recipe :",
    "first seek out a symplectic manifold @xmath92 which    1 .",
    "has the same euler characteristic and signature as @xmath90 .",
    "2 .   has @xmath93 pairwise disjoint lagrangian tori , @xmath94 , each containing a nonseparating loop @xmath95 , such that the collection of @xmath95 represents a basis for @xmath96 .",
    "now perform @xmath97 luttinger surgeries consecutively on the lagrangian tori @xmath94 , obtaining symplectic manifolds @xmath98 with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and in particular , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "denote the symplectic manifold @xmath103 by @xmath9 . referring to diagram",
    "we see that there is a distinguished nullhomologous torus @xmath5 in @xmath9 containing a loop @xmath32 which has a pushoff which is nullhomologous in the complement of @xmath5 .",
    "performing @xmath11-surgery with respect to this framing yields @xmath104 as in .",
    "because @xmath104 is symplectic and @xmath105 , it follows that @xmath106 .",
    "the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath68 , the result of @xmath67 surgery on @xmath5 with respect to the nullhomologus framing of @xmath32 , is calculated via .",
    "for example , if we are in one of the situations where the sum on the right of reduces to a single term , then it is clear that the manifolds @xmath68 are pairwise nondiffeomorphic . in any case",
    ", infinitely many of the @xmath68 are pairwise nondiffeomorphic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if , furthermore , each of the manifolds @xmath68 is simply connected , then they are all homeomorphic to @xmath90 .",
    "however , it is often difficult to verify that any of the manifolds @xmath68 are indeed simply connected .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this process is called  reverse engineering \" .",
    "the manifold @xmath92 is called a  model manifold \" for @xmath90 .",
    "the reverse engineering process follows easily when @xmath107 . as we showed in @xcite , @xmath108",
    "may be taken as a model manifold in that case .",
    "then @xmath109 and one can find six lagrangian tori upon which luttinger surgeries kill @xmath2 .",
    "we are then left with a symplectic manifold @xmath9 which is homeomorphic to @xmath0 and a nullhomologous torus @xmath5 in @xmath9 containing a nullhomologous loop @xmath32 so that @xmath67 surgeries with respect to the nullhomologous framing of @xmath32 give an infinite family of homeomorphic but pairwise nondiffeomorphic @xmath1-manifolds . of these manifolds @xmath68 ,",
    "only @xmath9 itself is symplectic .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath0 . that one is creating an exotic smooth structure follows almost directly from @xcite . since @xmath3 is a complex surface of general type , its canonical class pairs positively with its kahler form .",
    "surgering lagrangian tori does not change this phenomenon ( see @xcite ) ; so we obtain a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath110 which is homeomorphic to @xmath0 but for which @xmath111 . according to @xcite , however , each symplectic structure on @xmath0 satisfies @xmath112 ; so @xmath9 can not be diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown by using adjunction inequality arguments that the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath9 is @xmath113 where @xmath114 corresponds to the canonical class , whereas the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath0 vanishes since @xmath0 admits a positive scalar curvature metric .",
    "our goal now is to enhance ths procedure to show that there is a single nullhomologous torus @xmath5 in @xmath0 upon which the sequence of @xmath67 surgeries gives our infinite family of manifolds .",
    "to do this we need to answer two questions :    1 .",
    "how does one go about finding nullhomologous tori in a manifold ?",
    "what criteria do they need to satisfy in order to be useful for changing the smooth structure ?",
    "we are not able to answer these questions generally , but we can give satisfying answers in the case of @xmath0 and more generally for @xmath6 , @xmath7 .    to address the first of the questions ,",
    "suppose that we have a smooth @xmath1-manifold @xmath90 which contains an embedded smooth torus @xmath5 of self - intersection @xmath11 .",
    "choose local coordinates in which a tubular neighborhood @xmath115 of @xmath5 is @xmath116 .",
    "the _ bing double _",
    "@xmath117 of @xmath5 consists of the pair of tori @xmath118 ( bing double of the core circle @xmath119 ) .",
    "the solid torus @xmath120 is shown in figure  [ doubles](a ) .",
    "this description ( including the splitting of @xmath121 into the product @xmath122 and a fixed framing , _ i.e. _ a fixed trivialization of the normal bundle of @xmath5 ) determines this pair of tori up to isotopy .",

    "often , surgery on the other torus will then change the smooth structure of the ambient manifold .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is an elliptic fiber in the rational elliptic surface @xmath123 , a @xmath67 surgery on the second torus ( with respect to an appropriate framing ) will give the result of knot surgery using an @xmath124-twist knot ( @xcite )    as we have seen in lemma [ null ] , one can not count on finding tori such as @xmath5 . instead , we seek a manifold smaller than @xmath125 which still contains the bing tori @xmath117 . if we view @xmath126 , and write the first @xmath127 as @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , and the second @xmath127 as @xmath130 and consider @xmath131 ( see figure  2 ) , then @xmath132 consists of a pair of punctured tori , and @xmath133 is a link in @xmath134 .",

    "if we can find a symplectic structure @xmath213 as above , then @xmath206 is positive and will be represented by a symplectic surface ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can apply the adjunction formula to @xmath206 : @xmath214 and we see that @xmath206 is represented by symplectic surface of genus @xmath215 in particular , for @xmath107 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "thus if we have a collection of nullhomologous tori such that surgery on them changes @xmath90 to @xmath9 they must serve to increase the genus of the canonical class by @xmath218 . notice that this is precisely the number of surgeries needed to go from the model @xmath3 to @xmath9 !",
    "we next address the question of how one can go about finding nullhomologous tori in @xmath0 which will serve to raise the genus of the canonical class from @xmath150 to @xmath219 . as a warmup , referring to figure [ s^2xt^2](b ) , note that surgery on one of the bing tori intersecting a disk @xmath220 will not embed after the surgery , however there is an obvious puntured torus , @xmath157 which will .",
    "thus , surgery will force the genus of this disk to go up by one .",
    "the technique presented in @xcite will be useful for embedding nullhomologous tori so that surgery on them accomplishes this .",
    "rather than repeating what was already presented in that paper , we will illustrate the idea of a pinwheel structure in the case of @xmath221 and @xmath0 and refer the reader to @xcite for specifics and generalizations .    toward this end",
    "consider a linear @xmath121-action on @xmath221 .",
    "its orbit space is a polygon as shown in figure [ cp](a ) .",
    "the vertices are images of fixed points , while an edge labeled @xmath222 has isotropy group the circle group described in polar coordinates by @xmath223 , and the interior points are the images of principal orbits .",
    "we have divided this figure into three quadrilaterals ; each is the image of a standard @xmath1-ball coordinate neighborhood of one of the three fixed points of this torus action . in figure [ cp](a )",
    "we have also noted the self - intersection numbers ( all @xmath58 ) of the @xmath140-spheres described by the edges .",
    "let @xmath224 be the rational ruled surface with a negative section @xmath225 of square @xmath59 .",
    "it is useful to view each of these @xmath1-balls as the complement in @xmath224 of @xmath225 and a fiber @xmath226 .",
    "figure [ cp](b ) indicates how these complements are glued together .",
    "( this example was originally described in a slightly different fashion in @xcite . ) the extra labelings in this figure give the isotropy types and self - intersection numbers for the spheres @xmath225 and @xmath226 in a @xmath121 action on @xmath224 .",
    "note that we have glued the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of the negative section of one @xmath1-ball to the neighborhood of a fiber in the next .",
    "of course , strictly this can not be done , but since in @xmath224 the section @xmath225 and a fiber meet in a point , we need only glue together the boundaries of normal @xmath127-bundles restricted over punctured surfaces ( genus @xmath11 in this case ) , and these restricted bundles are all trivial .",
    "think of the boundary of our @xmath1-ball in @xmath224 as @xmath227 where we are gluing together the pieces @xmath228 , one @xmath1-ball to the next .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure  [ 3fold ] . in that figure ,",
    "the wedge - shaped regions in the center denote neighborhoods of the intersection of @xmath225 and @xmath226 after the section and fiber have been deleted .",
    "after gluing all three components this way , we obtain a manifold whose boundary is a @xmath121 bundle over a circle .",
    "if the total space of this bundle is @xmath38 , then we can fill in the boundary with @xmath125 to obtain a closed manifold .",
    "of course this is what happens in our example of @xmath221 .",
    "more generally , when there are three pieces , if the sum of the two euler numbers of the normal bundles removed at each interface is @xmath59 ( as in figure [ cp](b ) ) , then the boundary will be @xmath38 .",
    "see @xcite for more general criteria .",
    "the spheres @xmath225 and @xmath226 are referred to as ` interface surfaces ' .",
    "each of the three @xmath1-ball components comprising the pinwheel structure of @xmath221 has the handlebody decomposition of figure [ hopf](a ) .",
    "removing the negative section @xmath225 from @xmath224 leaves a @xmath178 bundle over @xmath229 with euler number @xmath150  this gives the @xmath140-handle , and removing the fiber @xmath226 adds the @xmath150-handle .",
    "figure [ hopf](b ) shows normal circles @xmath230 and @xmath231 to the negative section and fiber of @xmath224 .",
    "the components of the pinwheel are glued together so that @xmath231 in one component is identified with @xmath230 in the next .",
    "thus , @xmath231 bounds a disk @xmath232 ( the cocore of the @xmath58-framed @xmath140-handle ) in an adjacent pinwheel component .",
    "it also follows that the bing double of @xmath231 bounds disjoint disks inside a small neighborhood of @xmath232 . we can ambiently add @xmath140-handles to the bing double of @xmath231 in the first pinwheel component while subtracting these @xmath140-handles from the second component . since subtracting",
    "a @xmath140-handle is equivalent to attaching a @xmath150-handle , this handle - trading process , when done in each pinwheel component , turns each @xmath1-ball of figure [ hopf](a ) into the manifold shown in figure [ inp2 ] .",
    "the result of this handle - trading is to create a new pinwheel structure for @xmath221 where the interface surfaces are now tori rather than spheres .",
    "this process is shown schematically in figure [ ht ] .    ]    unfortunately , these new pinwheel components do not contain copies of our manifold @xmath139 .",
    "( compare figures [ inp2 ] and [ a](b ) .",
    ") however , if we blow up each pinwheel component , we get pinwheel components @xmath233 , @xmath234 , as illustrated in figure  [ blownup ] , where all the handles are labeled .",
    "the new components @xmath233 clearly contain @xmath139 . blowing up three times accomplishes this for each pinwheel component .",
    "thus @xmath0 contains three copies of @xmath139 , hence three copies of @xmath117  all together six nullhomologous tori .",
    "we need to see that surgery on these tori produces a symplectic manifold @xmath9 homeomorphic to @xmath0 with @xmath111 . according to proposition [ t_0->a ] , standard surgeries on @xmath117 change @xmath139 into @xmath190 .",
    "so if we perform these surgeries in each pinwheel component , they become @xmath235 three of these get glued together in a pinwheel which is obtained from @xmath0 via six standard surgeries .",
    "since each component is obtained by removing a a pair of transversely intersecting symplectic surfaces from a symplectic manifold , it follows from a theorem of symington @xcite that it gives a pinwheel structure for a symplectic manifold @xmath236 . in @xcite",
    "this is called a _",
    "3-fold sum _ of symplectic manifolds .",
    "( surely , @xmath236 is @xmath3 , but this is as yet unproved . )",
    "furthermore , the tori @xmath5 and @xmath158 of lemma  [ sxt ] become lagrangian in @xmath236 as in proposition [ t_0->a ] .",
    "thus we have six lagrangian tori in @xmath236 upon which we can perform luttinger surgeries to kill the first betti number of @xmath236 . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the result @xmath9 of these surgeries is simply connected .",
    "( one should not underestimate the importance of this calculation .",
    "many mistakes in the literature have been made at this point . )",
    "hence , @xmath9 is the symplectic manifold that we have sought .",
    "let @xmath237 and @xmath238 denote the lagrangian tori in @xmath236 obtained from the tori @xmath239 and @xmath240 of the @xmath241th copy of @xmath117 ( @xmath242 ) after the standard surgeries on @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath243 say .",
    "this means that @xmath9 is the union of @xmath244 with six copies of @xmath125 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath9 is the result of six surgeries on the nullhomologous tori @xmath239 and @xmath240 in @xmath0 . combining this with our discussion from ",

    "single _ nullhomologous torus in @xmath0 upon which surgery gives rise to an infinite family of mutually nondiffeomorphic @xmath1-manifolds homeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "to do so , we will show that surgery on less than all six of the nullhomologous tori @xmath245 in @xmath0 gives back @xmath0 again ; so its effect is to re - embed the remaining tori .",
    "in particular , surgery on any five of these tori will re - embed the remaining torus in @xmath0 , and surgery on this torus will give rise to the distinct smooth structures on @xmath0 .",
