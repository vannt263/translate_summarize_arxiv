    "<S> in interacting multi - component dark matter ( dm ) models , if the dm components are nearly degenerate in mass and the interactions between them are strong enough , the relatively heavy dm components can be converted into lighter ones at late time after the thermal decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the relic density of the lightest dm component can be considerably enhanced at late time . </S>",
    "<S> this may contribute to an alternative source of boost factor required to explain the positron and electron excesses reported by the recent dm indirect search experiments such as pamela , fermi - lat and hess etc ..    in the recent years , a number of experiments such as pamela @xcite , atic @xcite , fermi - lat @xcite and hess @xcite etc . </S>",

    "<S> if the dm particles are thermal relics such as the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , the thermally averaged product of their annihilation cross section with the relative velocity at the time of thermal freeze out is typically @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the positron or electron flux produced by the dm annihilation can be parametrized by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the smooth local halo dm energy density estimated from astrophysics , @xmath3 is the averaged electron number produced per dm annihilation which depends on dm models and parameters in the models for the propagation of cosmic ray particles , and @xmath4 is the mass of the dm particle . </S>",
    "<S> the boost factor @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 with @xmath7 the true local dm density and @xmath8 the dm annihilation cross section multiplied by the relative velocity and averaged over the dm velocity distribution today . </S>",
    "<S> both the pamela and fermi - lat results indicate that a large boost factor is needed  @xcite . for a typical dm mass of @xmath91(1.6 ) tev the required boost factor is @xmath10 for dm annihilating directly into @xmath11 and @xmath7 fixed at @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a large boost factor may arise from the non - uniformity of the dm distribution in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the n - body simulations show , however , that the local clumps of dark matter density are unlikely to contribute to a large enough @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an other possibility of enhancing the boost factor is that the dm annihilation cross section may be velocity - dependent which grows at lower velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the dm annihilation cross section today may be much larger than that at the time of thermal freeze out , and thus is not constrained by the dm relic density . </S>",
    "<S> some enhancement mechanisms have been proposed along this line , such as the sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite . in some non - thermal dm scenarios , the number density of the dm particle </S>",
    "<S> can be enhanced by the out of equilibrium decay of some heavier unstable particles if the dm particle is among the decay products of the decaying particle  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the unstable particle must take place at very late time . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the dm particles with the enhanced number density will annihilate into the standard model ( sm ) particles again , which washes out the enhancement effect .    in this talk </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss an alternative origin of the boost factor arising from the late time dark matter conversion processes , which requires neither the velocity - dependent annihilation cross section nor the decay of unstable particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the scenarios of interacting multi - component dm , the interactions among the dm components may convert the heavier dm components into the lighter ones , which is not sensitive to the details of the conversion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> if the interactions are strong enough and the dm components are nearly degenerate in mass , the conversion can enhance the number density of the lighter dm components at late time after the thermal decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the whole dm today in the universe may consist of only the lightest dm component with enhanced number density , which leads to a large boost factor . </S>",
    "<S> the scenarios of multi - component dm have been discuss previously in refs .  </S>",
