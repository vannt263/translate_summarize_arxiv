    "the damping torque @xmath17 in ( [ dsz1 ] ) accounts for dissipative processes , see for a review .",
    "two phenomenological forms for @xmath17 are employed commonly : the landau - lifshitz form@xcite with damping constant @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the gilbert form@xcite with damping constant @xmath20 , @xmath21 the difference between the two is usually very small and almost all theoretical and simulation studies of current - induced domain wall motion solve ( [ dsz1 ] ) with the gilbert form of damping.@xcite this is significant because , as we now discuss , gilbert damping and landau - lifshitz damping produce quite different results for this problem when the same spin transfer torque is used .    consider a nel wall where @xmath22 lies entirely in the plane of a thin film when the current is zero . by definition , @xmath23 if we choose @xmath24 as the equilibrium structure which minimizes the free energy @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "gilbert damping brings this motion to a stop because @xmath28 rotates @xmath24 out - of - plane until the torque from magnetostatic shape anisotropy cancels the spin - transfer torque . however , if the non - adiabatic term in ( [ dsz2 ] ) is non - zero , steady wall motion occurs at speed @xmath29 .    using this information ,",
    "two recent experiments@xcite used their observations of average domain wall velocities very near @xmath11 to infer that @xmath30 for permalloy nanowires .",
    "this is consistent with microscopic calculations ( which include disorder - induced spin - flip scattering ) that report @xmath31 @xcite or @xmath32 @xcite for realistic band models of an itinerant ferromagnet . on the other hand , calculations for `` s - d '' models of ferromagnets with localized moments",
    "find little numerical relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "a rather different interpretation of the data follows from a discussion of current - driven domain wall motion in the s - d model offered by barnes and maekawa.@xcite these authors argue that there should be no damping of the magnetization when a wall which corresponds to a minimum of the free energy @xmath25 $ ] simply translates at constant speed .",

    "the `` correct '' equation of motion is @xmath37 because it reduces ( for energy - minimizing walls ) to @xmath38 in the absence of extrinsic pinning , this argument identifies the experimental observation of long - distance wall motion with a uniformly translating solution @xmath39 of ( [ mini ] ) with minimum energy .",
    "as we discuss below , it is possible to convert between descriptions with landau - lifshitz and gilbert dampings by concurrently changing the value of the non - adiabatic spin - transfer torque . the landau - lifshitz description in eq .",
    "[ correct ] is equivalent to one with gilbert damping with @xmath31 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to argue that there are conceptual reasons to prefer the description with landau - lifshitz damping even when @xmath40 .",
    "section ii presents micromagnetic simulations that confirm the discussion above and describes further details .",
    "then , the remainder of this paper provides three theoretical arguments which support the use landau - lifshitz damping for current - driven domain wall motion ( in particular ) and for other magnetization dynamics problems ( in general ) .",
    "first , we reconcile our preference for landau - lifshitz damping with the explicit microscopic calculations of gilbert damping and non - adiabatic spin torque reported in refs .  .",
    "second , we show that gilbert damping can increase the magnetic free energy in the presence of spin - transfer torques .",
    "finally , we show that landau - lifshitz damping is uniquely selected for magnetization dynamics when the assumptions of non - equilibrium thermodynamics are valid .",
    "our analysis begins with a check on the robustness of the foregoing model predictions using full three - dimensional micromagnetic simulations of current - driven domain wall motion.@xcite we studied nanowires 12  nm thick and 100  nm wide with material parameters chosen to simulate @xmath41 . at zero current ,",
    "this geometry and material system support in - plane magnetization with stable domain walls of transverse type.@xcite figure  [ transverse ] shows the wall position as a function of time for a transverse domain wall for several values of applied current density @xmath13 .",
    "the curves labelled gilbert ( @xmath42 ) show that wall motion comes quickly to a halt .",
    "examination of the magnetization patterns confirms the torque cancellation mechanism outlined above .",
    "the curves labelled landau - lifshitz show that the wall moves uniformly with the velocity given by ( [ speed ] ) which is independent of the damping parameter @xmath18.@xcite    ) and the two forms of damping in ( [ dl ] ) and ( [ dg ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the sudden turn - on of the current and hence oersted magnetic field at @xmath43 generates the small amplitude undulations of the curves in figure  [ transverse ] but otherwise has little effect on the dynamics .",
    "an initial state of a stable vortex wall in a 300 nm wide wire produces similar results , except that under the gilbert formulation the vortex wall moves about twenty times farther before stopping as compared to the transverse wall in the 100 nm wire .",
    "we conclude from these simulations that the basic picture of domain wall dynamics gleaned from one - dimensional models is correct .",
    "the magnetic free energy behaves differently in simulations depending on whether landau - lifshitz or gilbert damping is used . before the current is turned on , the domain wall is in a configuration that is a local minimum in the energy . for landau - lifshitz damping ,",
    "the energy remains largely constant near this minimum and is exactly constant if the oersted fields are ignored . for gilbert damping , the energy increases when the current is turned on and the walls distort . for a transverse wall ,",
    "the distortion is largely an out of plane tilting .",
    "initially , the energy increases at a rate proportional to the damping parameter ( ignoring higher order corrections discussed in the next section ) . the details of this behavior are somewhat obscured by the oscillations due to the oersted magnetic field , but are quite apparent in simulations in which this field is omitted . as the wall tilts out of plane , the torque due to the magnetostatic field opposes the wall motion and the wall slows down .",
    "eventually the torque balances the adiabatic spin transfer torque and the wall stops .    in simulations using gilbert damping ,",
    "the change in magnetic free energy between the initial and final configurations is independent of the damping parameter as it is determined by the balance between the magnetostatic torque and the adiabatic spin transfer torque .",
    "however , the amount of time before the wall stops and the distance the wall moves are inversely proportional to the damping parameter .",
    "the gilbert damping torque is responsible for this increase in energy as can be seen from analyzing the directions of the other torques .",
    "precessional torques , like those due to the exchange and the magnetostatic interactions that are important in these simulations , by their nature are directed in constant energy directions and do not change the magnetic free energy .",
    "the adiabatic spin transfer torque is in a direction that translates the domain wall and does not change the energy in systems where the energy does not depend on the position of the wall .",
    "thus , in simulations of ideal domain wall motion without oersted fields , the gilbert damping torque is the only torque that changes the energy . throughout these simulations ,",
    "the gilbert damping torque is in a direction that increases rather than decreases the magnetic free energy .",
    "when @xmath44 , it is well known that a few lines of algebra converts the equation of motion ( [ dsz1 ] ) with gilbert damping into ( [ dsz1 ] ) with landau - lifshitz damping ( and vice - versa ) with suitable redefinitions of the precession constant @xmath5 and the damping constants @xmath18 and @xmath20.@xcite the same algebraic manipulations @xcite show that ( [ correct ] ) is mathematically equivalent to a gilbert - type equation with @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] to analyze ( [ equivg ] ) , we first ignore spin - transfer ( put @xmath47 ) and note that this re - written landau - lifshitz equation differs from the conventional gilbert equation only by an @xmath48 renormalization of the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "consequently , first - principles derivations of any equation of motion for the magnetization must be carried to second order in the putative damping parameter if one hopes to distinguish landau - lifshitz damping from gilbert damping .",
    "this observation shows that papers that derive gilbert damping@xcite or landau - lifshitz damping@xcite from microscopic calculations carried out only to first order in @xmath20 can not be used to justify one form of damping over the other .",
    "now restore the spin - transfer terms in ( [ equivg ] ) and note that the transformation to this equation from ( [ correct ] ) automatically generates a non - adiabatic torque with @xmath31 .",
    "this transformation means that to lowest order in @xmath20 and @xmath16 , an equation of motion with gilbert damping and a non - adiabatic coefficient @xmath49 is equivalent to an equation of motion with landau - lifshitz damping with non - adiabatic coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that equivalent equations of motion can be made using either form of damping , albeit with rather different descriptions of current induced domain wall motion .",
    "nevertheless , as we argue below , there are conceptual advantages to the landau - lifshitz form .",
    "landau - lifshitz damping irreversibly reduces magnetic free energy when spin - transfer torque is present .",
    "the same statement is not true for gilbert damping .",
    "this can be seen from the situation described in section  ii where gilbert damping causes a minimum energy domain wall configuration to distort and tilt out of plane .",
    "nothing prevents an increase in magnetic free energy for this open system , but it is clearly preferable if changes magnetic configurations that increase @xmath25 $ ] come from the effects of spin - transfer torque rather than from the effects of a torque intended to model dissipative processes .",
    "this is an important reason to prefer @xmath33 in ( [ dl ] ) to @xmath28 in ( [ dg ] ) .",
    "this argument depends crucially on the fact that the adiabatic spin - transfer torque is _ not _ derivable from a free energy as we discuss henceforth .",
    "the field @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ dsz1 ] ) is the ( negative ) gradient of the magnetic free energy .",
    "the component of this gradient in the direction that does not change the size of the magnetization is @xmath52 $ ] . since this direction is exactly that of the landau - lifshitz form of the damping , eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) , it follows that this form of the damping always reduces this magnetic free energy . when the gilbert form of the damping , eq .",
    "( [ dg ] ) , is used in eq .",
    "( [ dsz1 ] ) , it is possible to rewrite the damping term as @xmath53+{\\cal o}(\\alpha^2)$ ] .",
    "further , one can always write @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an effective `` spin transfer magnetic field '' . however , unlike the field @xmath56 in ( [ dsz1 ] ) , there is no `` spin transfer free energy '' @xmath57 which gives @xmath58 as its gradient : @xmath59 if ( [ nfe ] ) were true , the lowest order ( in @xmath20 ) gilbert damping term @xmath60 $ ] would indeed always lower the sum @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , a clear and convincing demonstration of the non - conservative nature of the spin - transfer torque is not easy to find",
    ". therefore , in what follows , we focus on the adiabatic contribution to ( [ dsz2 ] ) and show that a contradiction arises if ( [ nfe ] ) and its equivalent , @xmath62 are true .    .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for this argument we consider a simpler model than that discussed in section  ii . figure  [ domainwall ] shows the magnetization @xmath24 for a one dimensional nel wall in a system with uniaxial anisotropy along the @xmath0-direction .",
    "the domain wall of width @xmath63 is centered at @xmath64 and the plane of the magnetization is tilted out of the @xmath0-@xmath65 plane by an angle @xmath66 .",
    "a convenient parameterization of the in - plane rotation angle @xmath67 is @xmath68.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 the magnetic free energy of this domain wall is independent of both its position and its orientation ( angle @xmath66 )",
    ".    for electron flow in the @xmath0-direction , ( [ dsz2 ] ) shows that the adiabatic piece of the spin - transfer torque lies entirely in the plane of the magnetization : @xmath72 this torque rotates the magnetization in a manner which produces uniform translation of the wall in the @xmath0-direction with no change in @xmath66 . since @xmath73 comparison with ( [ sine ] ) shows that @xmath74 outside the wall as expected .",
    "the magnetic free energy of the domain wall does not change as the wall is translated .",
    "now , as indicated above ( [ nfe ] ) , we are free to interpret the foregoing wall translation as resulting from local precession of @xmath75 around an effective field @xmath76 directed perpendicular to the plane of the domain wall .",
    "specifically , @xmath77 however , if ( [ nfe ] ) and thus ( [ fake ] ) are assumed to be correct , the magnitude and direction of @xmath58 imply that the putative free energy @xmath57 decreases when @xmath24 rotates rigidly around the @xmath0-axis in the direction of increasing @xmath66.@xcite on the other hand , the free energy must return to its original value when @xmath66 rotates through @xmath78 .",
    "since the gradient ( [ nfe ] ) can never increase the free energy , we are forced to conclude that our assumption that @xmath57 exists is incorrect .",
    "neglected work by iwata@xcite treats magnetization dynamics from the point of view of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.@xcite his non - perturbative calculations uniquely generates the landau - lifshitz form of damping . in this section ,",
    "we make equivalent assumptions but go farther and derive an expression for the damping constant .",
    "mori and co - workers did this using a projection operator method.@xcite our more accessible discussion follows reif s derivation of a langevin equation for brownian motion.@xcite    we begin by taking the energy change in a unit volume @xmath79 where the repeated index @xmath20 implies a sum over cartesian coordinates .",
    "it is crucial to note that the magnitude @xmath80 is fixed so only rotations of @xmath22 toward the effective field @xmath51 change the energy of the system .",
    "the interaction with the environment enters the equation of motion for the magnetization through a fluctuating torque @xmath81 : @xmath82 the torque @xmath83 is perpendicular to @xmath22 since @xmath84 .",
    "we consider the evolution of the magnetization over a time interval @xmath85 which is much less than the precession period , but much greater than the characteristic time scale for the fluctuations @xmath86 . after this time interval ,",
    "the statistical average of the change in magnetization @xmath87 is @xmath88 the equilibrium boltzmann weighting factor @xmath89 gives @xmath90 .",
    "however , @xmath91  when  the magnetization is out of equilibrium .",
    "indeed , this method derives the damping term precisely from the bias built into the fluctuations due to the changes @xmath92 in the energy of the magnetic system .",
    "the boltzmann weight used to calculate @xmath93 is @xmath94 where ( assuming that @xmath51 does not change much over the integration interval ) , @xmath95 note that precession does not contribute to @xmath96 . only motions of the magnetization that change the energy of the magnetic subsystem produce bias in the torque fluctuations .",
    "therefore , since @xmath97 for small @xmath98 , the last term in ( [ delta_m ] ) now involves only an average over the equilibrium ensemble : @xmath99    we recall now that the torque fluctuations are correlated over a microscopic time @xmath86 that is much shorter than the small but macroscopic time - interval over which we integrate . therefore , to the extent that memory effects are negligible , we define the damping constant @xmath18 ( a type of fluctuation - dissipation result ) from @xmath100 for @xmath101 and with @xmath102 , which restricts the fluctuations to be transverse to the magnetization , but otherwise uncorrelated . this approximation reduces the last term in ( [ almost ] ) to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , is the piece of @xmath105 which is perpendicular to @xmath22 . substituting ( [ correlatet ] ) into ( [ almost ] ) gives the final result in the form , @xmath106 equation  ( [ final ] ) is the landau - lifshitz equation for the statistically averaged magnetization .",
    "it becomes a langevin equation when we add a ( now ) unbiased random torque to the right hand side .",
    "the procedure outlined above generates higher order terms in @xmath18 from the expansion of the thermal weighting to higher order in @xmath107 .",
    "the second order terms involve an equilibrium average of three powers of @xmath108 . these are zero for gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the third order terms involve an average of four powers of @xmath108 , and are non - zero .",
    "they lead to a term proportional to @xmath109 , which we expect to be small and to modify only large - angle motions of the magnetization .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed current - driven domain wall motion using both gilbert - type and landau - lifshitz - type damping of the magnetization motion .",
    "equivalent equations of motion can be written with either type of damping , but the implied description of the dynamics ( and the relative importance of adiabatic and non - adiabatic effects ) is very different in the two cases .    with",
    "landau - lifshitz damping assumed , adiabatic spin transfer torque dominates and produces uniform translation of the wall .",
    "non - adiabatic contributions to the spin transfer torque distort the wall , raise its magnetic energy , and thus produce a magnetostatic torque which perturbs the wall velocity .",
    "damping always acts to reduce the distortion back towards the original minimum - energy wall configuration . with gilbert damping assumed ,",
    "the damping torque itself distorts and thereby raises the magnetic energy of the moving wall .",
    "the distortion - induced magnetostatic torque stops domain wall motion altogether .",
    "additional wall distortions produced by non - adiabatic spin - transfer torque are needed to produce wall motion .    in our view ,",
    "landau - lifshitz damping is always preferable to gilbert damping .",
    "when spin - transfer torque is present , this form of damping inexorably moves the magnetic free energy toward a local minimum .",
    "gilbert damping does not . even in the absence of spin - transfer torque ,",
    "arguments based on irreversible thermodynamics show that the landau - lifshitz form of damping is uniquely selected for a macroscopic description.@xcite here , we proceeded equivalently and derived the landau - lifshitz equation of motion as the unique langevin equation for the statistical average of a fluctuating magnetization with fixed spin length .",
