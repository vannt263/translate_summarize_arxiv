    "<S> is that sm and its direct generalizations such as gut s can not serve as a fundamental theory at a very high energies because they do not include quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> these theories should be regarded as an effective field theories which are only valid at the restricted energy range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the fundamental `` ultimate '' theory will be someday achieved , it will probably differ from the conventional quantum field theory and include the nonlocal implications . as an example of such a theory one can consider the string theory which produce gravity as an induced interaction and thus solves the quantum gravity problem . in fact </S>",
    "<S> the construction of mathematically consistent string theory ( or its generalizations ) is only part of the work that has to be done . </S>",
    "<S> the next problem is to understand in which way the unified theory can manifest itself .    </S>",
    "<S> one has to notice that the consistent string theory predicts , along with the metric , other components of the gravitational field . </S>",

    "<S> therefore the torsion field is predicted by string theory and it is quite interesting to establish what the effects of torsion can look like . </S>",
    "<S> recently there were an interesting works devoted to this problem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the effects of external background torsion to the quantized matter fields were discussed in @xcite , and some of these papers @xcite contain numerical bounds on the possible torsion effects . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological consequences of the propagating torsion were considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first of this papers contains an interesting discussions in the contest of effective field theory and some upper bounds for torsion . </S>",

    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to prove that the action of dynamical torsion necessary contains massive vector field and to evaluate its possible observational consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the action for the torsion pseudovector and find that it contains two free parameters ( one of them is torsion mass ) and study the phenomenological consequences of this action . as the result of this study we obtain an upper bounds on the parameters of the torsion action using present experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a basic notations , give a very brief review of gravity with torsion and establish an additional softly broken symmetry which holds for the spinor field coupled to torsion ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss the possible form of divergences which may appear in the theory with propagating torsion and find the form of the action which provides the renormalizability . </S>",
    "<S> section 3 is devoted to the phenomenological consequences of the propagating torsion , and in section 4 we draw some conclusions and outline the perspectives for the future study .    </S>",
    "<S> * spinor field coupled to torsion and electromagnetic field *    let us give a very brief review for the basical notions of the gravity with torsion . </S>",
    "<S> one can find more detailed introduction to the gravity with torsion in refs . @xcite and to the quantum field theory in curved space - time with torsion in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> which notations we use below . </S>",
    "<S> the metric @xmath10 and torsion @xmath11 have to be considered as an independent characteristics of the space - time . </S>",
    "<S> since here we are interested in the torsion effects only , the metric is supposed to be flat minkowski one everywhere . in the theory with torsion </S>",
    "<S> the covariant derivative @xmath12 is based on the nonsymmetric connection @xmath13 with ^ _ - ^ _ </S>",
    "<S> = t^ _ , [ tor ] indeed @xmath13 is not a tensor because one can use the curvilinear coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the metricity condition @xmath14 enables one to express the connection through metric and torsion in a unique way as ^ _ = \\{^_}+ ( t^ _ - t^ _ - t^ _ ) [ con ] where @xmath15 is the christoffel symbol . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the rest of the formula ( [ con ] ) is tensor and thus it can not be eliminated by the change of coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> it proves convenient to divide the torsion field into three irreducible components : trace @xmath16 ; pseudotrace @xmath17 and the tensor @xmath18 , for which the two conditions are satisfied @xmath19    in the string - induced action , which depends on the completely antisymmetric torsion , only the pseudovector part @xmath20 is present , and thus one can always set t _ = _ </S>",
    "<S> s^. [ anti ] below we shall use the pseudovector @xmath21 as parametrization for the antisymmetric torsion tensor .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimal action of the dirac spinor fields in an external gravitational field with torsion follows from the standard procedure ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one has to change the partial derivatives @xmath22 to the covariant ones @xmath23 . in case of the general riemann - cartan manifold @xcite </S>",
    "<S> one has also to change the flat metric @xmath24 to the general one @xmath25 and generalize the volume element @xmath26 to the covariant one @xmath27 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 this procedure leads to the expression : @xmath29 = id^4x | ( ^_- _ 5^s_- i m ) [ dirac ] here @xmath30 is covariant derivative of the spinor field ( see @xcite for the details . )    the renormalizability of the gauge model in an external torsion field requires the nonminimal interaction of the spinor and scalar fields with torsion @xcite . later on </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that this is reasonable to introduce the nonminimal spinor - torsion interaction in the theory with the propagating torsion as well . for this reason we shall start our study from the action of the dirac spinor nonminimally coupled with the electromagnetic and torsion fields s_1/2= id^4x| [ diraconly ]    the new interaction with torsion does nt spoil the invariance of the above action under usual gauge transformation :  </S>",

    "<S> = e^_5(x ) ,    of the theory one faces generalized gauge symmetry depending on scalar @xmath31 and pseudoscalar @xmath32 parameters of transformation . </S>",
    "<S> as it will be shown below , this new symmetry requires torsion to be massive vector field and furthermore the action of torsion is fixed with accuracy to the values of nonminimal parameter @xmath33 , mass of the torsion @xmath34 and possible higher derivative terms .    in the framework of effective field theory </S>",
    "<S> the effects of a very massive fields are suppressed by the factors of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of the field and @xmath37 the typical energy of the process . thus if we take @xmath34 to be of the planck order then the effects of torsion will be negligible at the energies available at the modern experimental facilities . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis of torsion , propagation at energies lower than the planck one supposes that @xmath36 is essentially smaller than the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> then we have two options : take torsion to be massless or consider the mass of torsion as a free parameter which should be defined on the experimental basis . </S>",
    "<S> as far as the torsion can propagate , one has to incorporate it into the sm along with other vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the form of the action for torsion , which leads to the consistent quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> the higher derivative terms in the action , in general , lead to the unphysical ghosts and to the consequent violation of unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we restrict the torsion action by the second derivative and zero - derivative terms . </S>",
    "<S> the general action including these terms has the following form : s_tor = d^4\\ { -a s_s^ + b(_s^)^2 + m_ts^2s_s^ } [ geral ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are some positive parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the action ( [ geral ] ) contains both transversal vector mode and the longitudinal model which is in fact equivalent to the scalar ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) in particular , in the @xmath40 case only the scalar mode , and for @xmath41 only the vector mode propagate . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known  @xcite that in the unitary theory of the vector field both longitudinal and transversal modes can not propagate , and therefore , in order to have consistent theory of torsion one has to choose one of parameter @xmath42 to be zero .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact the only correct choice is @xmath41 . to see this one has to reveal that the symmetry , which is spoiled by the massive terms only , is always preserved in the renormalization of the dimensionless couplings constants of the theory . in other words , the divergences and corresponding local counterterms , which produce the dimensionless renormalization constants , do not depend on the dimensional parameters such as the masses of the fields . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry ( [ trans ] ) holds for the massless part of the action ( [ diraconly ] ) and therefore on the general grounds one has to expect that the gauge invariant counterterm @xmath43 appears if we take the loop corrections into account .    </S>",
    "<S> we want emphasize that in the framework of effective field theory the level of approximation for taking into account the massive fields is qualitatively the same for the tree level and for the lower loop effects . </S>",
    "<S> therefore as far as the propagating torsion is considered and the kinetic term in ( [ geral ] ) is taken into account , one has to formulate the theory as renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting the high energy effects while the low energy amplitudes are considered may mean that we disregard some higher derivative terms . </S>",
    "<S> however the violation of the renormalizability in that sectors of the theory which are taken into account is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if we start from the purely scalar longitudinal torsion ( as the authors of @xcite did ) then the transversal term @xmath43 will arise with the divergent coefficient and this will indeed violate both the finiteness of the effective action and the unitarity of the @xmath44-matrix . all this is true even in the case that only the tree - level effects are evaluated , if only such consideration is regarded as an approximation to any reasonable quantum theory .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the kinetic term of the torsion action is given by the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ geral ] ) with @xmath41 . as concerns </S>",
    "<S> the massive term it is not forbidden by the symmetry ( [ trans ] ) , because the last is softly broken . </S>",
    "<S> therefore apriory there are no reasons to suppose that @xmath45 . the only one question is : whether the massive counterterm really appears if we take into account the fermion loops . to investigate this </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the one - loop calculation of divergences in the theory ( [ diraconly ] ) , using the standard schwinger - dewitt technique and dimensional regularization ( one can see @xcite for introduction and references ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of these calculations of ) and consequent renormalization group equations will be given elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] _ div [ a , s ] = - _ div [ efac ] is the following counterterm : s [ a _ , s ] = d^4x\\ { f_f^ + s_s^ - ^s_f _ + 8m^2 ^ 2s^s _ } [ contra ] with @xmath46 here we have neglected all surface terms except @xmath47 , because it can , in principle , lead to quantum anomaly . the phenomenological consideration below is restricted by the tree - level effects and therefore this term is beyond the scope of our present interest . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the counterterms ( [ contra ] ) indicates that the massive term in the action of torsion is indeed necessary for the renormalizability and hence the correct form of the action is s_tor = d^4\\ { -14s_s^ + m_ts^2 s_s^ } [ action ] in the last expression we put the conventional coefficient @xmath48 in front of the kinetic term . with respect to the renormalization </S>",
    "<S> this means that we ( in a direct analogy with qed ) can remove the kinetic counterterm by the renormalization of the field @xmath21 and then renormalize the parameter @xmath33 in the action ( [ diraconly ] ) such that the combination @xmath49 is the same for the bare and renormalized quantities . </S>",
    "<S> instead one can include @xmath50 into the kinetic term of ( [ action ] ) , that should lead to the direct renormalization of this parameter while the interaction of torsion with spinor has minimal form ( [ dirac ] ) and @xmath21 is not renormalized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in the case of propagating torsion the difference between minimal and nonminimal interactions is only the question of notations on both classical and quantum levels .    in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we shall discuss the possible consequences of the torsion action at low energies and find some numerical upper bounds for torsion . from the string theory point of view @xmath34 should have the value of the planck order . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this choice does nt give a chance to make any speculations and estimates using an available experimental data because they are obtained at the energies which are ( at least ) 16 orders smaller than the planck ones . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we suppose that as a result of some cancelation the string inspired mass @xmath34 vanishes and then take @xmath34 to be some free parameter of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider two different possibilities : i ) torsion is much more heavy than other particles of sm and @xmath51 ii ) torsion has a mass comparable to that of other particles . in the last case one meets a propagating particle which must be treated on an equal footing with other constituents of sm . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to that , the very heavy torsion leads to the effective contact four - fermion interactions .    consider this in some more details , starting from the actions ( [ diraconly ] ) and ( [ action ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the massive term dominates over the covariant kinetic part of the action , the last can be disregarded . </S>",
    "<S> then the action @xmath52 leads to the algebraic equation of motion for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of this equation can be substituted back to @xmath54 and thus produce the contact four - fermion interaction term _ </S>",
    "<S> int = - ( |_5^)(|_5 _ ) [ contact ]    as one can see the only one quantity which appears in this approach is the ratio @xmath55 and therefore the phenomenological consequenses may depend only on single parameter .    in the next section we consider the upper bounds on the phenomenological manifestations of contact interactions between quarks and leptons and also some observational limits for the propagating torsion .    * </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> possible physical observables related with torsion action and the limits on the torsion parameters *    in this section we put the limits on the parameters of the torsion action using results of various experiments . </S>",
    "<S> torsion being a pseudo - vector particle interacting with fermions might give therefore different physical observables .    </S>",
    "<S> physical observables related with torsion depend on the two basic parameters , namely on the torsion mass @xmath34 and the constant of the interaction between torsion and fermion fields @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of our study we choose , for the sake of simplicity , all the torsion couplings with fermions to be the same @xmath33 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enables one to put the limits in the two dimensional ( @xmath34-@xmath33 ) parameter space using the present experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the straightforward consequence of the action term for torsion interaction with fermion field is the effective four - fermion contact interaction of leptons and quarks ( [ contact ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> four - fermion interaction effectively appears for the torsion with mass much higher than the energy scale available at present colliders . </S>",
    "<S> there are several experiments from which the constraints on the contact four - fermion interactions come :    1)experiments on polarized electron - nucleus scattering - slac e - d scattering experiment@xcite , mainz e - be scattering experiment @xcite and bates e - c scattering experiment @xcite ; 0.8 mm 2)atomic physics parity violations measures @xcite electron - quark coupling that are different from those tested at high energy experiment provides alternative constraints on new physics . 0.8 mm 3 ) @xmath56 experiments - sld , lep1 , lep1.5 and lep2 ( see for example @xcite ) ; 0.8 mm 4)neutrino - nucleon dis experiments  ccfr collaboration obtained model independent constraint on the effective @xmath57 coupling @xcite ; 0.8 mm 5)hera experiment for the polarized lepton - proton beams interactions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first we consider a limits on the contact interactions induced by torsion . </S>",
    "<S> the contact four - fermion interaction may be described by the lagrangian  @xcite of the most general form : @xmath58 subscrips i , j refer to different fermion helicities : @xmath59 ; where @xmath60 could be quark or lepton ; @xmath61 represents the mass scale of the exchanged new particle ; coupling strength is fixed by the relation : @xmath62 , the sign factor @xmath63 allows for either constructive or destructive interference with standard model ( sm ) @xmath64 and @xmath65-boson exchange amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the formula ( [ cont ] ) can be successfully used for the study of the torsion - induced contact interactions because it includes an axial - axial current interactions as a particular case .    recently </S>",
    "<S> the global study of the electron - electron - quark - quark(@xmath66 ) interaction sector of the sm  @xcite have been done using data from all mentioned above experiments ( except the fifth item ) . </S>",
    "<S> the limits established in this paper are the best in comparison with the previous ones . since the effective contact lagrangian for torsion has axial - axial structure we used the limits obtained in paper  @xcite for this kind of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the limits on @xmath67 of paper  @xcite are quite close to those of  @xcite but are not suitable for our analysis because axial - axial interaction have not been studied in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> axial - axial current may be expressed through rr , lr , rl and lr currents in the following way : @xmath68 for the axial - axial @xmath69 interactions  ( [ cont ] ) takes the form ( we put @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 the limit for the contact axial - axial @xmath66 interactions comes from the global analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath72 for the parameters of the effective contact four - fermion interactions of general form ( 13 ) and contact four fermion interactions induced by torsion ( 12 ) we have the following relations : @xmath73 > from ( [ glob ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) one gets the following limit on torsion parameters : @xmath74    -0.8 cm -0.8 cm +    the limits on @xmath34 and @xmath33 coming from the ( [ globfin ] ) is shown in figure  1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> some remark about the energy limits taken in this plot is in order . </S>",
    "<S> we started exclusion region from @xmath75  1  tev . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is related with the fact that the application of effective - contact interactions ( [ contact ] ) is valid up to the certain mass of the torsion below which an exact calculation ( regarding the field @xmath21 as dynamical ) should be done . </S>",
    "<S> the relative data of the two approaches are shown on the figure 2 , where the results for gauge interaction  ( [ action ] ) and contact interactions  ( [ cont ] ) for torsion are compared . </S>",
    "<S> as an example we have calculated total cross section for lep1.5 with @xmath76 gev and @xmath33 equal to 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that for torsion heavier than 1 tev the approximation of the effective contact interaction works almost perfectly , reproducing the result for the exact calculation with 0.1% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the scale 1 tev is appropriate starting point for putting the limit on torsion parameters using the lagrangian with contact interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> scenario with light torsion is in general more difficult because here we have two independent parameters and thus are enforced to study the @xmath77-dimensional restrictions from the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed there is no rigid border between two cases , as we shall see below .    for constraining @xmath78 parameter space for light torsion we use results of lep1.5 analysis of paper@xcite : </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of @xmath79 process was measured with accuracy 1 - 2% . </S>",
    "<S> we used this fact to put the limits on torsion mass and coupling : 90% acceptance for electron and 60% for muon channels was assumed , the total cross section for these reaction were calculated and 4% deviation from the standard model prediction was taken for establishing the limits . </S>",
    "<S> the results constraints is shown in figure  1(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the torsion with the mass in the range of present colliders could be produced in fermion - fermion interactions as a resonance , decaying to fermion pair . </S>",
    "<S> the most promising collider for search the signature of such type is tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> search for new particles decaying to two - jets has been done recently by d0 and cdf collaborations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data that we use in our analysis are extracted from figure presented d0 collaboration which established the limit on the production cross section of @xmath80 and @xmath81 bosons . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume also 90% events efficiency ( including efficiency of kinematical cuts and trigger efficiency ) and calculated the cross section for torsion production at tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> then we applied d0 limit at 95% cl for torsion production cross section and converted into the limit for @xmath78 plane . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is shown in figure 1  ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the points for the exclusion curve are given in table  1 .    </S>",

    "<S> 1(d ) .    </S>",
