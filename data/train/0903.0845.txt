    "ultracold atomic physics in optical lattices has created a new experimental arena where many simple model hamiltonians can be constructed and ` simulated ' experimentally  @xcite . to date , the most successful efforts have been with bosonic atoms on optical lattices  @xcite . here , when the single - particle bands of the optical lattice are well separated in energy , the boson - boson interaction is much smaller than that separation , and the particle filling is not too high , the system is described well by the single - band bose - hubbard ( bh ) model .",
    "this model is the bosonic generalization of the hubbard model and was introduced originally to describe @xmath2he in porous media or disordered granular superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the superfluid phase of bosonic systems is well described by weak - coupling theories , but the insulating phase , where there is a gap to particle excitations with a uniform ( integer ) filling of the bosons on each lattice site , is a strong - coupling phenomenon that only appears when the system is on a lattice .",
    "this mott insulator phase is incompressible and hence occupies a finite area in the parameter space of the chemical potential and the hopping .",
    "it has a transition from the incompressible phase to a compressible superfluid as the hopping or chemical potential are varied .",
    "the on - site bh model has been studied extensively , and the strong - coupling perturbation theory approach has been shown to be quite accurate in determining this phase diagram of the system  @xcite .    recently , experimental progress has been made in constructing ultracold dipolar gases of molecules , namely k - rb molecules , from a mixture of fermionic @xmath3k and bosonic @xmath4rb atoms  @xcite . in this case , the molecules are fermionic , but similar principles will allow one to also create bosonic dipolar molecules .",
    "future experiments are likely to load these bosonic molecules into optical lattices",
    ". these systems will have a long - range boson - boson interaction mediated by their dipole moment , which can be approximated , in some circumstances , by an on - site and a nearest - neighbor repulsion ( generically , dipole - dipole interactions will be longer ranged than just nearest neighbors and also can have directionality due to the orientations of the dipoles ) .",
    "the case of an extended bh model , where the boson - boson interaction is longer ranged , has also been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of a nearest - neighbor repulsion can lead to the formation of a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase , where , at half - filling for example , one would have a checkerboard arrangement of the density in an ordered pattern .",
    "this phase is incompressible with a finite gap to excitations ; it also breaks the original translational symmetry of the lattice , forming a new crystalline phase .",
    "the cdw phase has generated significant interest , because it often can become a supersolid prior to becoming a superfluid as the interactions are reduced .",
    "a supersolid phase is a ( compressible ) superfluid that continues to have a density modulation ( or cdw ) present  @xcite ; that is , the superfluid and crystalline orders co - exist .",
    "interest in supersolid physics has increased dramatically since the recent observation of supersolid - like behavior in low - temperature he experiments  @xcite .",
    "there is some numerical and theoretical evidence that the supersolid phase exists only in dimensions higher than one  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the extended bh model with on - site and nearest - neighbor boson - boson interactions via a strong - coupling perturbation theory in the hopping , plus a scaling analysis , which allows us to accurately predict the critical point , and the shape of the insulating lobes in the plane of the chemical potential and the hopping .",
    "we carry the analysis out to third - order in the hopping , and we perform the scaling theory using the known critical behavior at the tip of the insulating lobes [ which corresponds to the ( @xmath5)-dimensional @xmath6 model , and is identical for the mott and cdw phases ] .    the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows . after introducing the model hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : ebh ] , we develop the strong - coupling perturbation theory in the kinetic - energy term in sec .",
    "[ sec : sc ] , where we derive analytical expressions for the phase boundaries between the incompressible ( mott or cdw insulators ) and compressible ( superfluid or supersolid ) phases .",
    "there we also propose a chemical - potential extrapolation technique based on scaling theory to extrapolate our third - order power series expansion into a functional form that is appropriate for the mott or cdw lobes , and compare these results with the mean - field ones in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] . a brief summary of our conclusions is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the following extended bh hamiltonian with on - site and nearest - neighbor boson - boson repulsions @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the tunneling ( or hopping ) matrix between sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the boson creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath9 , @xmath13 is the boson number operator , @xmath14 is the strength of the on - site and @xmath15 is the longer - ranged boson - boson repulsion between bosons at sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath16 is the chemical potential . in this manuscript , we assume @xmath8 is a real symmetric matrix with elements @xmath17 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 nearest neighbors and @xmath18 otherwise and similarly for @xmath15 ( equal to @xmath19 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 nearest neighbors and zero otherwise ) , and consider a @xmath20-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath21 sites . note that we work on a periodic lattice with no external trap potential .",
    "we also assume @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lattice coordination number ( number of nearest neighbors ) . in this case",
    ", the boson occupancy of the nearest - neighbor sites in the cdw phase can only differ by one .",
    "for instance , the first cdw phase is such that every other site is occupied by one boson and the remaining sites are left unoccupied .",
    "when @xmath24 , additional cdw phases can be present in the phase diagram . for instance , a cdw phase in which every other site is occupied by two bosons and the remaining sites are left unoccupied is energetically more favorable than a mott phase in which every lattice site is occupied by one boson . our results , with minor changes ,",
    "can also be used to analyze these additional cdw phases if desired , but more work would be needed to examine other types of cdw order , like columnar ( stripes ) and so on , which can arise from longer - range interactions .      to understand the zero - temperature ( @xmath26 ) phase diagram of the extended bh model given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ebhh ] ) , we start by analyzing the atomic ( @xmath25 ) limit . in this limit , since the kinetic energy vanishes , the boson number operator @xmath27 commutes with all of the remaining terms of the hamiltonian . therefore , every lattice site is occupied by a fixed number @xmath28 of bosons and the system is insulating .",
    "when @xmath29 , the ground - state boson occupancy is the same for every lattice site such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the thermal average , and the average boson occupancy @xmath32 is chosen to minimize the ground - state energy for a given @xmath16 ( @xmath32 is an integer here and should not be confused with the condensate fraction of a superfluid ) .",
    "it turns out that the ground - state energy of the @xmath32 state is degenerate with that of the @xmath33 state at @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the chemical potential width of all mott lobes is @xmath35 , and that the boson occupancy increases from @xmath32 to @xmath33 when @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , the ground state is a vacuum with @xmath37 for @xmath38 ; it is a mott insulator with @xmath39 for @xmath40 ; it is a mott insulator with @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and so on .",
    "when @xmath43 , the ground state has an additional cdw phase which has crystalline order in the form of staggered boson densities , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 nearest neighbors .",
    "therefore , to describe the cdw phases , it is convenient to split the entire lattice into two sublattices a and b such that the nearest - neighbor sites belong to a different sublattice ( a lattice for which this can be done is called a bipartite lattice we assume the number of lattice sites in each sublattice is the same here ) .",
    "we assume that the boson occupancies of the sublattices a and b are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , such that @xmath48 .",
    "we remark that the @xmath49 states correspond to the mott phase .",
    "it turns out that the ground - state energy of the @xmath50 state is degenerate with those of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "this means that the chemical potential width of all mott and cdw lobes are @xmath35 and @xmath55 , respectively , and that the ground state alternates between the cdw and mott phases as a function of increasing @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , the ground state is a vacuum @xmath56 for @xmath38 ; it is a cdw with @xmath57 for @xmath58 ; it is a mott insulator with @xmath59 for @xmath60 ; it is a cdw with @xmath61 for @xmath62 ; it is a mott insulator with @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and so on .",
    "having discussed the @xmath25 limit , now we are ready to analyze the competition between the kinetic and potential energy terms of the hamiltonian when @xmath65 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , one expects that the range of @xmath16 about which the ground state is insulating ( incompressible ) decreases , and that the mott and cdw phases disappear at a critical value of @xmath1 , beyond which the system becomes compressible .      to determine the phase boundary between the incompressible ( mott or cdw insulators ) and the compressible ( superfluid or supersolid ) phases , we need the energies of the mott and cdw phases and of their defect states as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the defect states are characterized by exactly one extra particle or hole which moves coherently throughout the lattice . at the point where the energy of the incompressible state becomes",
    "degenerate with its defect state , the system becomes compressible assuming that the compressibility approaches zero continuously at the phase boundary .",
    "therefore , the phase boundary between the mott and superfluid phases is determined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy of the mott phase with @xmath32 bosons on every lattice site , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the energies of the mott - defect phases with exactly one extra particle or hole , respectively .",
    "these conditions determine the phase boundaries of the particle and hole branches of the mott insulating lobes , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath35 , @xmath72 and @xmath32 .",
    "similarly the phase boundary between the cdw and supersolid phases is determined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy of the cdw phase with @xmath46 and @xmath47 bosons on alternating lattice sites , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energies of the cdw - defect phases with exactly one extra particle or hole , respectively .",
    "these conditions determine the phase boundaries of the particle and hole branches of the cdw insulating lobes , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath35 , @xmath72 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "next , we calculate the energies of the mott and cdw phases and of their defect states as a perturbative series in the hopping @xmath1 .",
    "we use the many - body version of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in the kinetic energy term  @xcite to perform the expansion ( in powers of the hopping ) for the different energies needed to carry out our analysis .",
    "the perturbation theory is performed with respect to the ground state of the system when the kinetic - energy term is absent .",
    "this technique was previously used to discuss the phase diagram of the on - site bh model  @xcite , and its results showed an excellent agreement with the quantum monte carlo simulations ( including the most recent numerical work  @xcite ) . here , we generalize this method to the extended bh model , hoping to develop an analytical approach which could also be as accurate as the numerical ones .",
    "however , we remark that our strong - coupling perturbation theory can not be used to calculate the phase boundary between two compressible phases , _ e.g. _ the supersolid to superfluid transition .",
    "in addition , we can not even tell whether the compressible phase is a supersolid or a superfluid .      for our purpose , we first need the ground - state wavefuntions of the mott and cdw phases and of their particle and hole defects when @xmath25 . to zeroth order in @xmath1 ,",

    ". since a simple closed form analytic solution for @xmath16 is not possible , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mf - cdw ] ) with mathematica for each of the cdw lobes separately . in the @xmath153 limit , we also checked that our strong - coupling perturbation results for the cdw lobes agree with this exact solution when the latter is expanded out to third order in @xmath1 , providing again an independent check of the algebra .",
    "[ htb ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] , the results of the third - order strong - coupling perturbation theory ( dotted lines ) is compared to those of the exact mean - field theory ( red solid lines ) and of the extrapolation technique ( circles ) for an infinite ( @xmath153)-dimensional hypercubic lattice when @xmath192 .",
    "notice that , in infinite dimensions , both @xmath1 and @xmath72 must scale inversely with @xmath102 such that @xmath193 and @xmath194 are finite .",
    "the extrapolated solutions are indistinguishable from the exact ones for the mott lobes , and they are within @xmath195 of each other for the tips of the cdw lobes .",
    "it turns out that this minor disagreement around the tips of the cdw lobes is due to the large coefficient of the @xmath154 term in the power - series expansion .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , even in infinite dimensions , the agreement of the third - order strong - coupling perturbation theory with the exact mean - field theory is quite good .",
    "we analyzed the zero temperature phase diagram of the extended bose - hubbard ( bh ) model with on - site and nearest - neighbor boson - boson repulsions in ( @xmath0)-dimensional hypercubic lattices .",
    "we used the many - body version of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in the kinetic energy term with respect to the ground state of the system when the kinetic energy term is absent .",
    "this technique was previously used to discuss the phase diagram of the on - site bh model  @xcite , and its extrapolated results showed an excellent agreement with the recent quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite . here , we generalized this method to the extended bh model , hoping to develop an analytical approach which could be as accurate as the numerical ones .",
    "we derived analytical expressions for the phase boundaries between the incompressible ( mott or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) insulators ) and compressible ( superfluid or supersolid ) phases up to third order in the hopping @xmath1 .",
    "however , we remark that the strong - coupling perturbation theory developed here can not be used to calculate the phase boundary between two compressible phases , _ e.g. _ the supersolid to superfluid transition .",
    "we also proposed a chemical potential extrapolation technique based on the scaling theory to extrapolate our third - order power series expansion into a functional form that is appropriate for the mott or cdw lobes .",
    "we believe some of our results could potentially be observed with ultracold dipolar bose gases loaded into optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the recent success in observing superfluid to mott insulator transition with ultracold point - like bose gases loaded into optical lattices .",
    "such lattices are created by the intersection of laser fields , and they are nondissipative periodic potential energy surfaces for the atoms .",
    "an ultracold dipolar bose gas can be realized in many ways with optical lattices .",
    "for instance , heteronuclear molecules which have permanent electric dipole moments , rydberg atoms which have very large induced electric dipole moment , or chromium - like atoms which have large intrinsic magnetic moment , etc .",
    "can be used to generate sufficiently strong long - ranged dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "this work can be extended in several ways if desired .",
    "for instance , our current results for the cdw phase are not directly applicable to the one - dimensional case .",
    "we are currently working on this problem and will report our results elsewhere .",
    "in addition , it turns out that the coefficient of the @xmath154 term in the power series is generally small for the mott lobes , but it can become very large for the cdw lobes when @xmath155 . therefore , inclusion of the @xmath154 is necessary to improve the accuracy of the phase boundaries near the tips of the cdw lobes when @xmath155 .",
    "lastly , one can include the next - nearest - neighbor repulsion term to the current model , which would lead to additional cdw phases .",
    "one can also examine how the momentum distribution changes with the hopping in the cdw phase , or in the mott phase when there is a nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "this last calculation could have direct relevance for experiments on these systems and would generalize recent results for the @xmath196 case  @xcite .",
