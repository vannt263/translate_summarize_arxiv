    "the unbinding phase transition of the two complementary strands of the dna molecule has been a subject of continual interest for over four decades @xcite . in thermal denaturation",
    "this transition takes place when temperature is increased . in a typical experiment , a sample containing dna molecules of specific length and sequence is prepared .",
    "the fraction of attached bound base pairs , @xmath1 , is measured through light absorption at a wavelength of 260 nm . at low temperatures",
    "all base pairs are attached to each other while at high temperature they are all unbound .",
    "thus , @xmath1 decreases from one to zero as the temperature is increased . for heterogeneous dna molecules , containing both at and gc base pairs , @xmath1 does not decrease smoothly with temperature , but rather exhibits a multistep behavior .",
    "it consists of plateaus of various sizes separated by sharp jumps .",
    "this behavior is related to the fact that the gc bonds are stronger than at ones .",
    "thus , long domains with higher concentration of at bonds will denaturate at lower temperatures",
    ". the resulting stepped structure of @xmath1 is therefore characteristic of the particular dna sequence .",
    "it thus yields statistical information on the sequence of the molecule under study .",
    "the denaturation process has been verified through electron microscopy where denaturate loops and bound segments have been observed directly @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of the jumps indicates that the unbinding transition is _",
    "first order_.    more recently , the introduction of new techniques such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy @xcite has allowed the manipulation of single biological molecules .",
    "this made it possible to study a wider variety of physical properties of the dna molecule .",
    "for example optical tweezers have been used to apply a force and pull apart the two strands at one end of the molecule .",
    "it is found that a phase transition takes place at a critical force where the molecule is unzipped and the two strands are separated @xcite .",
    "thermal denaturation has been studied theoretically since the early sixties .",
    "the early models , which we refer to as poland - scheraga ( ps ) type models @xcite , consider the molecule as being composed of an alternating sequence of bound and denaturated segments . a bound segments is energetically favored over an unbound segment , while a denaturated segment ( loop ) is entropically favored over a bound one . within this approach",
    "the interaction between the different segments of the molecule has not been taken into account .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis considerably .",
    "the order of the transition is found to be determined by a parameter @xmath2 which characterizes the statistical weight of a loop .",
    "the number of configurations of a loop of length @xmath3 behaves as @xmath4 for large @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath5 is a non - universal constant .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the phase transition is first order if @xmath6 and second order if @xmath7 while for @xmath8 no transition takes place and the strands are always bound . using random - walk configurations to model a loop one finds that @xmath9 in @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "the transition is thus predicted to be continuous in @xmath0 and @xmath11 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this result is at variance with experimental observations .",
    "the model was later generalized to take into account the self - avoiding interactions _ within _ each loop @xcite .",
    "it is found that the loop entropy takes the same general form as before .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath2 now takes the value @xmath12 , where @xmath13 the correlation length exponent of a self - avoiding random walk . inserting the known values for",
    "@xmath13 one finds that although @xmath2 is larger than that of a random - walk model , it is still smaller than two both in @xmath0 and @xmath11 dimensions , yielding a continuous transition .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that self - avoiding interactions _ between _ the various parts of the chain ( and not just within loops ) would further sharpen the transition possibly making it first order .",
    "however , theoretical tools for carrying out this analysis have not been available at the time .",
    "more recently , excluded volume interactions have been fully taken into account in a numerical study of finite chains @xcite .",
    "these simulations strongly suggest that the transition is indeed first order .    in a recent study @xcite ,",
    "we have extended the ps model to take into account self - avoiding interactions both within a loop and between a loop and the rest of the chain .",
    "to carry out the analysis of this model one has to enumerate the configurations of a loop embedded in a chain with self - avoiding interactions .",
    "this has been done by taking advantage of recent results obtained by duplantier et  al .",
    "@xcite for the number of configuration of a general polymer network .",
    "it is found that the statistical weight of a loop embedded in a chain has the same general form as before , namely @xmath4 . however , the parameter @xmath2 is now modified and becomes larger than two in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "in particular one finds @xmath15 in @xmath11 and @xmath16 in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , self - avoiding interactions make the transition first order in two dimensions and above .",
    "recently a different model in which excluded volume interactions were partially taken into account has been found to yield a first order transition @xcite . in this model",
    "excluded volume interactions between the two strands of the chain were explicitly considered , but those within each strand were neglected .    in this work we present a detailed account of the results obtained when the interactions between various segments along the chain are taken into account using the scaling results of duplantier .",
    "we show that the denaturation transition is first order .",
    "however , the transition is found to be accompanied by critical fluctuations in some the chain s properties .",
    "for example , the loop size distribution is found to decay algebraically at the transition .",
    "indeed , the probability distribution for loops of length @xmath3 , @xmath17 , behaves as @xmath18 at the transition .",
    "this behavior was recently confirmed in numerical simulations of the model where the excluded volume interactions have been taken into account fully .",
    "the value of the measured exponent @xmath19 agrees well with our predictions @xcite .",
    "we also find that when the boundary conditions are such that the chain is open at one end the length @xmath20 of the end segment diverges as @xmath21 when the melting temperature @xmath22 is approached .",
    "we have extended the model to consider the unzipping transition which takes place when a force of magnitude @xmath23 is applied to separate the two strands .",
    "we find that this transition is first order .",
    "we also find that the end segment length diverges as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unzipping critical force .",

    "iia we review the analysis of poland and scheraga and that of fisher where self - avoiding interaction within a loop is taken into account . in section",
    "iib we analyze the model with full account of self - avoiding interactions .",
    "the length distribution of the end segment is considered in section iic and a summary and overview of other approaches to thermal denaturation of dna is given in section iid .",
    "in section iii the unzipping transition is studied .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "the model considers two strands , each composed of monomers .",
    "each monomer represents one persistence length of a single unbound strand .",
    "typically this is about @xmath27    @xcite , or roughly 8 bases .",
    "we set the boundary conditions such that the monomers at one end of the molecule are bound .",
    "such a boundary condition is necessary for a bound state between the two strands to exist .",
    "all other monomers on the chain can be either unbound or bound to a specific matching monomer on the second chain .",
    "the interactions between a monomer and other monomers on the second strand or on the same strand are ignored .",
    "the binding energy @xmath28 between matching monomers is taken to be the same for all monomer pairs .    a typical dna configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "it is made of an alternating sequence of bound segments and denaturated loops .",
    "the configuration ends with two denaturated strands . for simplicity",
    ", the configurational entropy of a bound segment associates with its embedding in ambient space is neglected .",
    "it is easy to verify that this assumption does not affect the nature of the denaturation transition obtained within this model .",
    "the statistical weight of a bound sequence of length @xmath3 is then given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the temperature and the boltzmann constant @xmath31 is set to 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is a decreasing function of the temperature . on the other hand",
    ", a denaturated loop does not carry an energy and its statistical weight is derived from its degeneracy . in this model it is assumed that the loop is fully flexible , and thus it is described by a random walk which returns to the origin after @xmath33 steps . considering all possible such walks the statistical weight for large @xmath3 has the form @xmath34 , where @xmath5 is a non - universal constant and the exponent @xmath2 is determined by the properties of the loop configurations . for simplicity , we set @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the statistical weight of the end segment , which consists of two denaturated strands each of length @xmath3 , takes the form @xmath36 for large @xmath3 , where @xmath37 is in general not equal to @xmath2 .",

    "we shall later discuss them in detail .",

    "for example the weight of a chain which consists of a bound segment of length @xmath39 , a denaturated loop of length @xmath40 , a bound segment of length @xmath41 , and a pair of denaturated strands of length @xmath42 , is given by @xmath43 the statistical weight of a more general chain configuration made of @xmath44 alternating bound segments and denaturated loops will have the same form with a suitable number of factors of the form @xmath45 before the end - segment weight @xmath46 .    the model is most easily studied within the grand canonical ensemble where the total chain length @xmath47 is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the grand canonical partition function , @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the canonical partition function of a chain of length @xmath47 , @xmath51 is the fugacity , the functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined by    @xmath55    and @xmath56 . in this equation",

    "this can arise either from the divergence of the numerator or from the vanishing of the denominator .",
    "the relevant situation , at low temperature , is the second one , which corresponds to @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 since @xmath65 this reduces to @xmath66 we shall see that above the transition , namely in the denaturated phase , the numerator diverges .",

    "the average number of bound pairs in a chain is given by @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 thus the nature of the denaturation transition is determined by the temperature dependence of the fugacity @xmath72 .",

    "these are @xmath104 the nature of the phase transition is thus directly related to the number of configurations of long denaturated loops within the chain . in the early studies of this problem",
    "the exponent @xmath2 was evaluated by considering the number of random walks which return to the origin as modeling the loop configurations @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that in @xmath10 dimensions the model yields @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that there is no transition for @xmath105 , a continuous transition for @xmath106 and a first - order phase transition for @xmath107 .",
    "the model was subsequently extended to include the repulsive short range interaction which exists between the strands constituting a loop . in this approach",
    "the loop is modeled as a self - avoiding walk  @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath108 , where @xmath13 is the exponent associated with the radius of gyration @xmath109 . for a self avoiding random walk of length @xmath47 one has @xmath110 , with @xmath111 in @xmath0 and @xmath112 in @xmath11 .",
    "this yields @xmath113 in @xmath0 and @xmath114 in @xmath11 .",
    "thus the transition is continuous in both cases , although it is sharper than when the repulsive interaction is neglected altogether .",
    "the two estimates of the exponent @xmath2 described above treat the loop as an isolated object and thus neglect its interaction with the rest of the chain .",
    "this simplification seems essential , since the formalism of the model relies on the segments composing the chain as being independent . in the next section",
    "we show that the repulsive interaction between a loop and the rest of the chain may be accounted for .",
    "although we treat these interactions only in an approximate way , we are able to give insight into the unbinding mechanism and on the nature of the transition .      to account for the excluded volume interactions between a loop and the rest of the chain we note that a microscopic configuration of the dna molecule is composed of many bound and unbound segments of various length .",
    "when evaluating the number of available configurations of a loop , one has to take into account the interactions with all these bound and unbound segments . here we simplify the problem and neglect the internal structure of the rest of the chain .",
    "we thus consider a loop embedded in a flexible chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : top1 ] ) and study the number of configurations of a chain endowed with this topology , assuming that it is self avoiding .",
    "we will show that in the limit where the loop length , @xmath115 , is much smaller than the length of the rest of the chain , @xmath116 , the statistical weight of this topology can be written as a product of the statistical weights of the loop and of the chain .",
    "the weight of the loop is found to be of the same form as that of a free loop but with a different exponent @xmath2 .",

    "the length of each of the two strands connected to the @xmath118 vertices is @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : top1],width=302 ]    to carry out this analysis we use results obtained by duplantier et al @xcite for the number of configurations of polymer networks of arbitrary topology . in order to make the paper self contained we first review in some detail these results .",
    "they represent an extension of the well known results for the number of configurations of a simple self - avoiding random walk @xcite . in this case",
    "it is known that the number of configurations scales as @xmath119 where @xmath47 is the length of the polymer , @xmath5 is a non - universal constant and @xmath120 is a universal exponent .",

    "a vertex with @xmath134 legs is said to be of order @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) . the number of vertices of order @xmath134 is denoted by @xmath136 . the number of configurations of the network , @xmath137 , is then given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the total length of the network and @xmath140 is a scaling function .",
    "this expression is valid asymptotically as @xmath141 , as long as all @xmath142 s diverge with the same rate .",
    "we note that the relation is valid also when the persistence length of each of the chains composing the graph is different .",

    "the value of the exponent @xmath2 is altered to ( [ top2 ] ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : top2 ] ) when one of the segments connected to the loop is short .",
    "this may be verified by noticing that as the loop is shrunk a vertex of order @xmath191 and one loop are lost .",
    "note that this does not imply that these values of @xmath2 can be used to give bounds on the true partition function of the model .      in the previous section",
    "it was argued that the excluded volume interactions between a denaturated loop and the rest of the chain cause the transition to be first order . as was noted this result",
    "is unaffected by the boundary terms @xmath59 and @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "( [ uv ] ) ) .",
    "however , when the dna molecule is fully denaturated , its statistical properties are determined by the boundary term @xmath54 .",
    "this is evident as the entropy of a denaturated molecule with free ends is much higher than that of one with the ends constraint to meet each other .",
    "namely , the number of configurations of a self - avoiding random walk is much higher than that of a self - avoiding random walk which returns to the origin .",
    "thus , one expects the average length of the end segment to diverge at the transition .",
    "this does not affect our previous results as long as the thermodynamic limit , @xmath193 , is taken before the temperature @xmath30 approaches the melting temperature @xmath194 .",
    "in this case the size of the end segment is always much smaller than the rest of the chain .",
    "the average length of the end segment is given by @xmath195 where @xmath63 is evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath20 near the transition takes one of three forms depending on the numerical value of @xmath37 :    ( _ i _ ) @xmath196 . in this case",
    "@xmath197 diverges like @xmath198 ( see appendix [ polylog : sec ] ) as @xmath199 .",
    "clearly its derivative with respect to @xmath51 diverges like @xmath200 and hence the average length of the end segment diverges like @xmath201 .",
    "@xmath202 . here",
    "@xmath203 is finite but its derivative diverges like @xmath204 as @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the average length of the end segment diverges like @xmath206 .",
    "( _ iii _ ) @xmath207 . in this case both @xmath203 and its derivative are finite at the transition .",
    "hence the end segment length is finite at the transition .",
    "we next use the temperature dependence of @xmath72 in order to evaluate the behavior of the end segment length @xmath20 as a function of the temperature near the transition .",
    "here one finds two regimes depending on the value of the exponent @xmath2 related to the entropy of the bulk loops @xcite . to derive these relations we note that for @xmath63 close to @xmath89 eq.([singularity ] ) yields for @xmath87 , @xmath208 where @xmath209 . using @xmath210^{-1}$ ] from eq .",
    "( [ transtion ] ) we obtain @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",

    "thus , eq .  ( [ ztoome ] ) yields two regimes for the temperature dependence of @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath98 the linear term in @xmath217 in eq.([ztoome ] ) is negligibly small compared to the left hand side and hence @xmath218 on the other hand for @xmath219 @xmath220 and therefore @xmath221    thus , the behavior of the end segment length @xmath20 depends on both exponents @xmath2 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have already shown that @xmath6 .",
    "we now turn to estimate the exponent @xmath37 .",
    "this exponent is associated with the degeneracy , @xmath222 , of an end segment of length @xmath3 , and its value may be deduced using the scaling argument presented above .",
    "one considers a y - fork topology where the two denaturated strands are much smaller than the bound segment representing the rest of the chain . using the terminology introduced in the preceding subsection one has to consider the difference of the exponent corresponding to the y - fork topology and the one corresponding to linear chain .",
    "this yields @xmath223 in @xmath0 , @xmath224 and @xmath171 , so that @xmath225 . in @xmath11 ,",
    "one may use the pad and pad - borel approximation results @xmath226 and @xmath227 to obtain @xmath228 .",
    "finally in @xmath122 , @xmath229 while above four dimensions clearly @xmath230 .",
    "this suggests that the exponent @xmath37 is smaller than one for any @xmath187 .",
    "since the degeneracy exponents satisfy @xmath6 and @xmath231 the analysis presented above suggests that near the melting transition the end segment length diverges like @xmath232      in the preceding subsections we reviewed the analysis of poland and scheraga , showing that the nature of the denaturation transition is governed by the exponent @xmath2 associated with the entropy of a denaturated loop embedded in a dna molecule .",
    "it is found that for @xmath75 there is no transition , for @xmath98 there is a continuous transition , while for @xmath6 the transition is first order . using recent results for the number of configurations of a self avoiding polymer network of general topology we have demonstrated that @xmath6 in @xmath0 dimensions and above . while the treatment is approximate the results strongly suggest that the transition is indeed first order in these dimensions .",
    "the results are unchanged even if the different persistence length of the bound and denaturated configurations is taken into account .",
    "the analysis of the length distribution of the end segment shows that the molecule melts from the unbound end .",
    "the boundary condition used in this analysis is such that the two strands are bound at one end .",
    "it is easy to show that when the boundary condition is modified such that the two strands are bound at the center rather than at one end , melting takes place from both ends .",
    "it is interesting to consider the case of a homopolymer where all the bases on one strand are the same .",
    "for example a molecule in which one strand is made only of g bases and the other strand is made only of c bases . here",
    "each base , and therefore a monomer in the model , can bind to any other base on the other strands and not just to a specific monomer , as is the case for a heteropolymer .",
    "the two arms of a loop need not be of the same length .",
    "thus the number of configurations of a loop of length @xmath3 changes by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "this amounts to using @xmath233 for the weight of a loop , effectively reducing the exponent @xmath2 to @xmath234 .",
    "since we have shown that @xmath235 for @xmath236 , this implies for a homopolymer the effective @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath117 but greater than @xmath237 .",
    "the transition in this case is thus expected to be _",
    "continuous_.    finally , we comment on recent attempts to account for the first - order nature of the denaturation transition without having to resort to excluded volume interactions . within this approach",
    "the two strands are considered as directed polymers and thus they do not self intersect .",
    "let @xmath238 the interaction potential between the corresponding monomers on the two strands .",
    "it is repulsive at short distances , has an attractive well at the characteristic pair bond distance and it tends to zero at large distances . using a transfer matrix approach , the thermodynamic properties of the chain are obtained by the ground state @xmath239 wavefunction of a schrdinger equation which takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath240    here @xmath241 is the ground state eigenvalue associated with the wave function @xmath239 .",
    "the mass @xmath242 represents the stiffness of the chain .",
    "the @xmath243-dependence of the mass is taken to account for the change of stiffness between bound and unbound strands  @xcite .",
    "one usually assumes that the potential @xmath238 is short ranged ( exponentially decaying with @xmath243 at large distances ) and that @xmath244 varies with @xmath243 over the same distance .",
    "the probability density of finding the strands a distance @xmath243 from each other is given by @xmath245 .",
    "in this language the order parameter @xmath1 is given by @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the range of the binding potential @xmath238 . here , for simplicity , we assume that neither @xmath244 nor @xmath238 depend on the orientation .",
    "the denaturation transition occurs when @xmath241 reaches zero so that there is no longer a bound state in the system .",
    "a first order transition occurs if @xmath1 has a non - zero value at that point . in this case one",
    "should have a bound state with energy @xmath248 .",
    "note that although @xmath1 might jump at the transition , the average distance between the strands , which is not the order parameter of the system , might diverge continuously .",
    "thus , we are interested in the solution of the equation @xmath249 since @xmath250 decays exponentially with @xmath251 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath239 at large distances is obtained by the equation @xmath252 it is easy to show that this implies @xmath253 for large @xmath251 . that is , the wave function for large @xmath251 is normalizable only for @xmath107 so one has a localized zero energy ground state . therefore using eq .",
    "( [ schtheta ] ) one can see that for any dimension @xmath254 the order parameter @xmath1 vanishes at the transition as is expected for a continuous transition .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs only for @xmath107 .",
    "note that this result is equivalent to using the poland - scheraga model with random walks modeling the loop entropy . within this approach",
    "the transition may thus be altered to first order in lower dimensions _ only _ when @xmath250 are long - range , in contrast to recent claims @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued that taking into account excluded - volume interactions _ between _ the two strands while neglecting these interactions within each strand effectively leads to a long range potential between the two strands @xcite .",
    "this model , which takes into account the excluded volume interactions only partially also leads to a first order transition .",

    "a number of experiments have investigated the response of double - stranded dna to external forces and torques  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become possible to apply and measure a force pulling apart two strands of a dna double helix  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the unzipping transition have been carried out using the directed polymer approach where self - avoiding interactions are not accounted for  @xcite . in most of these studies the unzipping of homopolymers has been analyzed .",

    "we extend the analysis of the ps model to consider the unzipping of homopolymers with self - avoiding interactions .",
    "we show that the unzipping transition is first order .",
    "we also calculate the dependence of the critical unzipping force on the temperature at low forces , namely near the melting temperature .",
    "we consider a configuration where the corresponding monomers at one end of the chain are bound together , while a force @xmath255 is applied on the two monomers at the other end of the chain , pulling the two strands apart . in this setup ,",
    "the grand canonical partition function takes the form @xmath256 where the factor @xmath257 is the grand partition function of the open tail under force .",

    "since @xmath63 is regular in @xmath23 , we have @xmath295 or @xmath296 . thus the two strands separate gradually from the end as the critical force is approached .",
    "nonetheless the unzipping transition is first order .",
    "the reason is that the transition takes place at a temperature below the denaturation melting temperature @xmath297 where the loop size distribution in the interior of the chain decays exponentially with the loop size .",
    "thus at this point the average loop size in the interior of the chain is finite . on the other hand",
    "the length of the end segment is finite as long as @xmath298 and its contribution to the order parameter @xmath1 and to the entropy is negligible .",

    "we have shown that the model yields a first - order transition in agreement with experiments and with numerical simulations .",
