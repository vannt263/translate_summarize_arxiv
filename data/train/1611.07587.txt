    "the spin pumping effect , in which a spin current is induced by the precession of magnetization in a ferromagnetic normal metal junction , is the basis of some of the most important technologies for spin current generation .",
    "the effect was theoretically derived by silsbee @xcite , who noted that when a microwave is applied to a junction , a dynamic spin accumulation is generated at the interface , which in turn leads to a flow of spin ( spin current ) as a result of electron diffusion .",
    "a similar type of spin current generation was later discussed by tserkovynak et al . in 2002 @xcite based on an application of scattering theory for adiabatic pumping effects ; this effect is known as the spin pumping effect @xcite .",
    "studies of adiabatic pumping were initiated by a seminal 1983 paper by thouless @xcite , in which transport induced by an adiabatic change of a potential was discussed in light of berry s phase attached to the wave function .",
    "current generation by a slowly oscillating potential was later discussed by bttiker et al . in the context of scattering matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the scattering theory of adiabatic pumping was generalized in the case of periodic variation by brouwer @xcite , who presented a formula describing the pumped charge by means of a scattering matrix .",
    "it was also pointed out that the variation of two independent parameters is necessary for adiabatic pumping .",
    "tserkovynak et al .",
    "applied brouwer s formula to a case of a junction between a ferromagnet and a normal metal and argued that a spin current is generated when the magnetization is dynamic .",
    "tserkovnyak et al .",
    "further noted that the amount of the pumped spin current is governed by what they termed a spin mixing conductance , which is related to a spin - dependent transmission coefficient .",
    "the dynamics of a magnetic system can be described by two parameters ( the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components for the case of precession around the @xmath2 axis ) , and thus the application of an adiabatic pumping theory requiring two independent driving parameters is reasonable .",
    "the spin pumping effect in ref .",
    "@xcite was originally discussed to explain the enhancement of magnetic damping discovered experimentally by mizukami et al @xcite .",
    "as the effect turned out to be a convenient experimental means for injecting spin current into metals , their work produced much stimulus for further experimental work , and the effect has been employed in a large number of recent studies @xcite .",
    "spin pumping theory was successful in the sense that it explained the effect by introducing a new phenomenological parameter - spin mixing conductance- and provided a convenient tool for interpreting experimental results .",
    "the spin mixing conductance can be estimated by first - principles calculations combined with a calculation of scattering properties @xcite . however , as was pointed out recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the formalism has a disadvantage from the viewpoint of material design , as the estimation of spin pumping efficiency requires solving a scattering problem and therefore the efficiency is not directly related to the material parameters .",
    "furthermore , as the theory was developed by borrowing the formalism for adiabatic pumping , and because it is only concerned with the spin mixing conductance , the physical mechanism of spin pumping remains obscure . without addressing the nature of the driving force or field for the spin current generation ,",
    "scattering theory may be able to provide an explanation of the phenomenon in which pumping is caused by a time variation of magnetization that modifies the scattering potential . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the spin pumping effect in order to clarify its physical mechanism . by identifying the driving field ,",
    "the relation between spin pumping and adiabatic pumping is expected to become clearer .    the issues of conventional spin pumping theory were studied and analternative formulation was presented in a recent paper by chen and zhang @xcite .",
    "they considered a small - amplitude oscillation of magnetization for which they calculated the spin current without using scattering theory and obtained an expression for the spin - pumping coefficient in terms of retarded and advanced green s functions .",
    "unlike the scattering approach , their formalism is applicable to systems with disorder and spin relaxation and it was used to study the effect of interface spin - orbit interaction .",
    "although the difficulties describing spin pumping in terms of scattering were resolved by chen and zhang , there remain issues to be further investigated , including how to clarify the fundamental difference and/or similarity between spin pumping and adiabatic charge pumping .",
    "although a general pumping formula based on berry s phase formulation @xcite to address adiabatic pumping is mathematically elegant , it is not practical for material designs aiming at spintronics applications .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop a practical formula for pumping effects and to use it as a basis for discussing the spin pumping effect . in the case of electrons driven by a general external potential ,",
    "we derive a linear response formula for the pumping effect that is written in terms of retarded and advanced green s functions and therefore can be smoothly incorporated into a first - principles calculation scheme .",
    "the relation of this formulation to the scattering approach was discussed within the argument put forth by fisher and lee @xcite .",
    "we show generally that the origin of the pumping is a non - commutativity between the external perturbation and the operator representing the particle distribution . in the dynamic - potential case ,",
    "the non - commutativity arises because the particle energies before and after the application of the dynamic perturbation are different , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present green s function representation , the topological meaning of adiabatic pumping ,",
    "discussed based on scattering matrix formulation @xcite , appears not clearly seen .",
    "the case of spin pumping is studied in detail by use of a unitary transformation in the spin space in order to correctly grasp the low - energy properties @xcite .",
    "thus our results are not restricted to a small - amplitude case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the driving field for spin pumping",
    "is identified as the non - adiabatic components of the spin gauge field @xmath3 , which is the linear order in the time derivative of the direction of the magnetization . at the linear order in the precession frequency , the spin gauge field containing the first - order time derivative",
    "is treated as static ; it therefore works as a static potential that causes spin mixing .",
    "it is shown that , even though the problem reduces to a static one , a spin current is pumped as a result of the non - commutativity of the spin - dependent potential ( spin gauge field ) . the mathematical mechanism for spin pumping viewed in the rotated frame as a response to the driving potential ( spin gauge field ) is therefore different from that in adiabatic charge pumping , in which the dynamic nature of the driving potential is essential , although it is obvious that spin pumping is a dynamic effect driven by dynamic magnetization .",
    "the fact that the spin gauge field is the physical field of spin pumping is consistent with experimental observations that the spin accumulation at the interface of a ferromagnet and a normal metal is greatly enhanced when magnetization becomes dynamic , while only a tiny accumulation is present in the static case @xcite .",
    "thus , the non - equilibrium spin accumulation mechanism driven by the spin gauge field is far more efficient than the one caused by a static magnetic - proximity effect .",
    "the physics of the spin pumping effect can be studied using a simplified model of a dynamic magnetic dot coupled to electron reservers or leads @xcite .",
    "phase shift argument was presented in ref .",
    "recently , a full counting statistics approach was employed to study the spin current from a dot under a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a pumping effect in a system of electrons in a potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a static potential and @xmath6 is a driving potential for the current .",
