    "neutron stars exhibit a large array of extreme characteristics . their properties and structure",
    "are determined by the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich stellar matter at densities up to an order of magnitude higher than those found in ordinary nuclei , see , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detailed knowledge about the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter over a wide range of densities is necessary for the study of neutron stars . for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", various theoretical studies have shown that the energy per nucleon can be well approximated by @xmath5 in terms of the baryon density @xmath6 , the isospin asymmetry @xmath7 , the energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter @xmath8 , and the bulk nuclear symmetry energy @xmath9 . here",
    "we report the results of a study on the moment of inertia and the core - crust transition density of neutron stars within well established formalisms in the literature using several eoss constrained by the latest terrestrial heavy - ion reaction experiments .",
    "presently , besides the possibilities of phase transitions into various non - nucleonic states the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme densities , pressures and/or isospin - asymmetry is still highly uncertain and relies upon , often , rather controversial theoretical predictions .",
    "this circumstance introduces corresponding uncertainties in the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter and thus limits our ability to understand many key issues in astrophysics .",
    "while astrophysical observations can also limit the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter , terrestrial laboratories experiments provide complementary information and have their unique advantages . in this regard ,",
    "it is especially interesting to mention that the collective flow and particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions have constrained the eos of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath10 up to about five times the normal nuclear matter density to a narrow range  @xcite .",
    "however , there are still many challenges and uncertainties in pinning down precisely the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "one of the major remaining uncertainties is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath11 , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . to constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy ,",
    "many terrestrial nuclear experiments have been carried out recently or planned .",
    "depending on the techniques used , some experiments are more useful for exploring the symmetry energy at low densities while others are more effective at high densities .",
    "for instance , heavy - ion reactions , especially those involving radioactive beams , provide a unique means to probe the @xmath11 over a broad density range  @xcite . in fact , some significant progress has been made very recently by studying the isospin diffusion  @xcite and isoscaling  @xcite in heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies .",
    "the analysis of these phenomena based on transport theories of heavy - ion reactions and thermodynamical models of nuclear multifragmentation has limited the @xmath11 in a range much narrower than that spanned by various forms of the @xmath11 currently used in astrophysical studies in the literature . moreover ,",
    "the lower bound of the @xmath11 extracted from the heavy - ion reactions is consistent with the rmf prediction using the fsugold interaction that can reproduce not only saturation properties of nuclear matter but also structure properties and giant resonances of many finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the sizes of neutron skins in heavy nuclei are sensitive to the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities , see , e.g. , refs .",
    ". however , available data of neutron - skin thickness obtained using hadronic probes are not accurate enough to constrain significantly the symmetry energy .",
    "interestingly , the parity radius experiment ( prex ) at the jefferson laboratory aiming to measure the neutron radius in @xmath12 via parity violating electron scattering ( jefferson laboratory experiment e-00 - 003 ) @xcite hopefully will provide much more precise data and thus constrain the symmetry energy at low densities more tightly in the near future . on the other hand , at supranormal densities ,",
    "a number of potential probes of the symmetry energy have been proposed  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "several experiments to probe the high density behavior of the symmetry energy with high energy radioactive beams have been planned at the csr / lanzhou , fair / gsi , riken and the nscl / msu .",
    "while the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter has not been completely determined yet , it is still very interesting to examine astrophysical implications of the eos constrained by the latest terrestrial laboratory experiments mentioned above .",
    "global properties of spherically symmetric static ( non - rotating ) neutron stars have been studied extensively over many years , for recent reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , properties of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars have been investigated to lesser extent .",
    "models of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars have been constructed only by several research groups with various degree of approximation ( see @xcite for a review ) . in a recent work  @xcite",
    "we have reported predictions on the gravitational masses , radii , maximal rotational ( kepler ) frequencies , and thermal properties of ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars . in this work ,",
    "using the nuclear constrained eoss we calculate the momenta of inertia for both spherically - symmetric ( static ) and ( rapidly ) rotating neutron stars using well established formalisms in the literature .",
    "such studies are important and timely as they are related to the astrophysical observations in the near future .",
    "in particular , the moment of inertia of pulsar @xmath13 in the extremely relativistic neutron star binary psr j0737 - 3039 @xcite may be determined in a few years through detailed measurements of the periastron advance @xcite .",
    "in this section , we first outline the theoretical tools one uses to extract information about the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we put the special emphasis on exploring the density - dependence of the symmetry energy as the study on the eos of symmetric nuclear matter with heavy - ion reactions is better known to the astrophysical community and it has been extensively reviewed , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "we will then summarize the latest constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy extracted from studying isospin diffusion and isoscaling in heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies .",
    "finally , we address the question of what kind of isospin - asymmetry , especially for dense matter , can be reached in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "heavy - ion reactions are a unique means to create in terrestrial laboratories dense nuclear matter similar to those found in the core of neutron stars . depending on the beam energy , impact parameter and the reaction system , various hadrons and/or partons",
    "may be created during the reaction .",
    "to extract information about the eos of dense matter from heavy - ion reactions requires careful modelling of the reaction dynamics and selection of sensitive observables . among the available tools ,",
    "computer simulations based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) transport theory have been very useful , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "the evolution of the phase space distribution function @xmath14 of nucleon @xmath15 is governed by both the mean field potential @xmath16 and the collision integral @xmath17 via the buu equation @xmath18 normally , effects of the collision integral @xmath17 via both elastic and inelastic channels including particle productions , such as pions , are modelled via monte carlo sampling using either free - space experimental data or calculated in - medium cross sections for the elementary hadron - hadron scatterings  @xcite .",
    "information about the eos is obtained from the underlying mean - field potential u which is an input to the transport model . by comparing experimental data on some carefully selected observables with transport model predictions using different mean - field potentials corresponding to various eoss , one",
    "can then constrain the corresponding eos . the specific constrains on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy that we are using in this work",
    "were obtained by analyzing the isospin diffusion data  @xcite within the ibuu04 version of an isospin and momentum dependent transport model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "an isospin and momentum - dependent interaction ( mdi )  @xcite is used . with this interaction , the potential energy density @xmath19 at total density @xmath20 ,",
    "temperature @xmath21 and isospin asymmetry @xmath22 is @xmath23 in the mean field approximation , eq .",
    "( [ mdiv ] ) leads to the following single particle potential for a nucleon with momentum @xmath24 and isospin @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for neutrons ( protons ) , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are all parameters given in ref .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ mdiu ] ) contain the momentum dependence of the single - particle potential , including that of the symmetry potential if one allows for different interaction strength parameters @xmath37 and @xmath33 for a nucleon of isospin @xmath38 interacting , respectively , with unlike and like nucleons in the background fields .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the nucleon isoscalar potential estimated from @xmath39 agrees with the prediction of variational many - body calculations for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite in a broad density and momentum range @xcite .",
    "moreover , the eos of symmetric nuclear matter for this interaction is consistent with that extracted from the available data on collective flow and particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions up to five times the normal nuclear matter  @xcite . on the other hand , the corresponding isovector ( symmetry )",
    "potential can be estimated from @xmath40 . at normal nuclear matter density , the mdi symmetry potential agrees very well with the lane potential extracted from nucleon - nucleus and ( n , p ) charge exchange reactions available for nucleon kinetic energies up to about @xmath41 mev  @xcite . at abnormal densities and higher nucleon energies , however , there is no experimental constrain on the symmetry potential available at present .",
    "the different @xmath29 values in the mdi interaction are introduced to vary the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear equation of state fixed .",
    "specifically , choosing the incompressibility @xmath42 of cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath43 to be @xmath44 mev leads to the dependence of the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the @xmath29 parameter according to @xmath47 with @xmath48 .     in the mdi interaction . taken from @xcite . ]    with the potential contribution in eq .",
    "[ mdiv ] and the well - known contribution from nucleon kinetic energies in the fermi gas model , the eos and the symmetry energy at zero temperature can be easily obtained .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ mdisyme ] , adjusting the parameter @xmath29 leads to a broad range of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , similar to those predicted by various microscopic and/or phenomenological many - body theories . as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , only equations of state with @xmath29 between -1 and 0 have symmetry energies in the sub - saturation density region consistent with the isospin diffusion data and the available measurements of the skin thickness of @xmath12 using hadronic probes .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to note that the symmetry energy extracted very recently from the isoscaling analyses of heavy - ion reactions is consistent with the mdi calculation using @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 with @xmath49 is also consistent with the rmf prediction using the fsugold interaction  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider only the two limiting cases with @xmath49 and @xmath50 as boundaries of the symmetry energy consistent with the available terrestrial nuclear laboratory data .",
    ".the parameters @xmath51  ( mev ) , @xmath52 , @xmath53  ( mev ) , @xmath54  ( mev ) , and @xmath55  ( mev ) for different values of @xmath29 .",

    "( [ eq.15 ] ) with the parameters listed in table  [ tab.4 ] .",
    "it is seen that the condition @xmath57 extracted from studying the glitches of the vela pulsar does put a strict lower limit on the radius for a given eos .",
    "it also limits the maximum mass to be less than about @xmath58 for all of the eoss considered .",
    "similar to the total momenta of inertia the ratio @xmath56 changes more sensitively with the radius as the eos is varied .",
    "recent experiments in terrestrial nuclear laboratories have narrowed down significantly the range of the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter although there are still many remaining challenges and uncertainties . in particular ,",

    "we found that the moment of inertia of psr j0737 - 3039a is limited in the range of @xmath59 @xmath3 .",

    "the corresponding fractional momenta of inertia @xmath56 of the neutron star crust are also constrained .",
