    "we note that the phase @xmath18 is automatically cancelled and that the last equation is a linear combination of the first three equations , i.e. , eqs . , and .",
    "therefore we have a well defined problem as there are four independent partial differential equations and four fields , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in the limit of time independent fields ,",
    "it is clear that only eq . and survive as @xmath21 and @xmath22 are solutions to the above equations .",
    "however time dependent solutions require to turn on @xmath23 and @xmath20 in order for the eom to be gauge invariant and self - consistent .",
    "we can now introduce the boundary conditions needed to solve the eom .",
    "following the standard ads / cft dictionary , close to the boundary we impose , m_t&=&(t , x)-(t , x)/r+  , [ muin ] and @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where we have set @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the charge density and @xmath29 is the chemical potential . before the quench",
    "we impose @xmath30 so that @xmath31 is the order parameter , o(x , t ) _ 2(x , t ) .",
    "[ param ] since we do not consider the case of a finite super - current we can safely set @xmath32 . at the horizon",
    "we impose that @xmath33 and that the rest of functions have no singularities .",
    "the next task is to define the thermal quench and to solve the eom by a suitable numerical algorithm .",
    "we aim to study the time evolution of the order parameter @xmath34 after a quench , namely , an abrupt change in the system .",
    "following ref.@xcite we induce the quench by turning on the source in the expansion of scalar around the boundary , @xmath35 with _ 1 = j ( vt ) [ que].we note that with our choice of coordinates the order parameter is to a good approximation still given by @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 the source goes from zero to @xmath38 very quickly which we expect to excite the system to a far - from equilibrium state .",
    "we keep the chemical potential constant , @xmath39 and let the charge density vary . at @xmath40",
    "we assume the system is described by a homogeneous and static solution of the eom with @xmath41 .",
    "the eom evolves this initial homogeneous and static solution to a solution that verifies the above boundary condition for the scalar close to the boundary .",
    "we choose @xmath42 so that the system is always superfluid , namely , @xmath43 where in our quantization , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we stay relatively close to @xmath45 so that the probe limit that we employ is still a good approximation . in order to solve the coupled partial differential equations we used the spectral method @xcite .",
    "we discretize the eom on a three dimensional chebyshev grid with @xmath46 points along the @xmath47 direction and @xmath48 points along the @xmath49 direction , and up to @xmath50 points along the @xmath11 direction .",
    "we study the time evolution for different values of @xmath51 .",
    "an important comment is in order . for technical reasons we do not have much flexibility to tune these parameters .",
    "if @xmath52 is very large then the perturbation is very slow so it is not really a quench . moreover",
    "it will take a long time to observe any interesting effect .",
    "for @xmath52 too small the perturbation is very fast , a true quench , so we expect a relatively fine structure in the time and space evolution of the order parameter which can not be resolved by the maximum number of points that we can simulate .",
    "more specifically we need that the coherence length which controls the spatial inhomogeneities be larger than the cutoff induced by the finite lattice spacing .",
    "that constraints the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "as was mentioned previously the problem of the dynamics of a holographic superconductor after a quench has already been investigated @xcite but in the limit of spatial homogeneity . here",
    "we show that a thermal quench makes the order parameter spatially inhomogeneous at least for the abrupt changes of temperature that we explore in this paper .",
    "more importantly we provide compelling evidence that these solutions have a lower free energy than the homogeneous ones .",
    "results for the quench with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the time evolution is similar for different spatial points .",
    "however the spatial dependence strongly depends on time . for short times",
    "it is almost spatially homogeneous however , for longer times , spatial oscillations of growing amplitude are clearly observed .",
    "the dependence on @xmath11 seems to be oscillatory which suggests that only few fourier modes are excited by the quench . for smaller @xmath52 or larger",
    "@xmath38 we expect a more intricate pattern .",
    "however it would require a smaller lattice spacing which is beyond our numerical capabilities .",
    "the wavevectors @xmath57 of the oscillations of the order parameter is inversely proportional to the superconducting coherence length @xmath58 with @xmath59 an integer . for sufficiently strong quenches",
    "this coherence length does not have to correspond to the equilibrium one but rather to the one at which the evolution became non adiabatic @xcite .",
    "this is nothing but a consequence of the kibble - zurek mechanism .",
    "physically this relatively simple oscillating pattern is an indication that the initially homogeneous order parameter decays into two states of finite and opposite momentum .",
    "finally we stress that even though the temperature is well defined across the sample , namely the chemical potential @xmath29 is uniform , the order parameter @xmath60 still develops a spatial dependence that grows with time",
    ".    these findings are consistent with those previously obtained @xcite for weakly coupled superconductors in the condensed matter literature .",
    "physically the spatial inhomogeneities @xcite are a consequence of re - arrangements of the order parameter in space and time after a quench which are compatible with the conservation of energy and momentum @xcite .",
    "similar results , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , are observed for other quench parameters .    in summary , for all quenches",
    ", we see that the superconductor will eventually become spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "next we investigate whether these inhomogeneous solutions correspond to the physical state of minimum energy . for that purpose",
    "we compare the free energy of the homogeneous and non - homogeneous solutions for long times around @xmath61 so that spatial inhomogeneities are more clearly observed .    the free energy @xmath62 is directly related to the on shell action @xmath63 @xcite . in order to evaluate @xmath63 it is convenient to integrate by parts and use the equations of motion which results in , s_os=_z=0",
    "d^3 x[-m_t m_t+ h m_x m_x+ h^2 m_rm_r ] - + d^4 x [ -+ m_r^2 ^2 ] , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 stands for the derivative with respect to z. we work in the grand canonical ensemble characterized by a fixed @xmath29 . it is possible to show that boundary contributions have divergences coming from the scalar contribution .",
    "fortunately this divergence can be removed by adding a counterterm .",
    "the resulting renormalized free energy is given by , @xmath67+\\int d^4x [ \\frac{m_t^2}{h z^2}\\rho-\\frac{m_x^2 \\rho^2}{z^2}+\\frac{h}{z^2}m_r^2\\rho^2 ] \\label{freee}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is already suitable to compute the free energy for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions at four different times which are close to @xmath68 .",
    "the results , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , provide clear evidence that for all quenches the inhomogeneous solution has always a lower free energy .",
    "this is a confirmation that , in general , thermal quenches not only make the order parameter time dependent but also space dependent .",
    "therefore spatial inhomogeneity is an intrinsic ingredient in the dynamics of a strongly coupled superconductor after a homogeneous thermal quench .    in conclusion",
    "we have studied the time evolution of a holographic superconductor after abruptly turning on the source of the scalar field .",
    "for all the quenches studied the solution with the lowest free energy is spatially non - uniform .",
    "time oscillations become unstable as spatial non homogeneities develop . to a good approximation",
    "the spatial dependence is a simple oscillatory function with an amplitude that increases with time until reaches , in the range of times studied , a constant value .",

    "<S> a typical example is the study of the spontaneous generation of defects @xcite in a bose gas after a temperature quench across the superfluid transition which is qualitatively described by the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more quantitative theoretical results are known @xcite in the more tractable problem of the dynamics of a zero dimensional mean - field superconductor after a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical study @xcite of the far - from equilibrium time evolution of a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductor resulted , in a certain region of parameters , in undamped time oscillations of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however it was later @xcite realized that for system sizes larger than the superconducting coherence length the quench can excite finite momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> this results in spatial inhomogeneities of the order parameter that make the time oscillations unstable . exact results in a one dimension quantum spin - chain that is driven from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic @xcite confirm this picture . despite these advances there is not yet a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe quantitatively most of these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the recent introduction of the holographic principle , also called the ( anti de sitter / conformal field theory ) ads / cft correspondence @xcite , in this context @xcite has broaden considerably the theoretical tools to tackle non - equilibrium problems . in the context of holographic superconductivity @xcite , the problem we study here , there are already several studies that employ ads / cft techniques to describe the time evolution of the order parameter after a thermal @xcite or quantum @xcite quench . in these papers </S>",
    "<S> it was assumed that the order parameter was spatially uniform . </S>",
    "<S> this is a useful simplification since the gravity equations of motion depend only on two instead of three variables . </S>",
    "<S> however from the above discussion it is plausible that spatial inhomogeneities play a important role in the dynamic evolution of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed recent ads / cft calculations have shown @xcite that a coupling to an axion field or a topological chern - simon term can induce a spontaneously breaking of translational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> spatially inhomogeneous solutions of the gravity equations are also a crucial ingredient in the recent description of two dimensional turbulence @xcite by holographic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics after a soft quench across a thermal or quantum critical point suggests @xcite that spatially inhomogeneous solutions might be stable . in the context of heavy ion collisions </S>",
    "<S> it was recently studied the far - from equilibrium dynamics in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore timely to ask whether the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry can also be induced by a quench . </S>",
    "<S> here we respond this question affirmatively . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of the order parameter of a holographic superconductor after a quench induced by turning on the source of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> even though the initial state and the quench are spatially homogeneous we have observed that , for all quenches studied , the order parameter becomes spatially inhomogeneous for sufficiently long times . </S>",
    "<S> this spatially non - uniform solution has a lower free energy than the homogeneous one . </S>",
