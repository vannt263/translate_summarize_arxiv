    "figure [ fig : uvpsc_feh_b](b ) shows the same 4.0 kg magnetic mass track required to fit the secondary in the age - radius plane over - suppresses the effective temperature .",
    "this causes the model to be too cool compared to the empirical value .",
    "intuitively , one might suggest lowering the surface magnetic field strength so as to maintain agreement in the age - radius plane while allowing for a hotter effective temperature .",
    "however , all values of the surface magnetic field strength that provide agreement in the age - radius plane produce models that are cooler than the empirical temperature .    how might we interpret the remaining temperature disagreement ?",

    "we feel this scenario is unlikely considering the temperatures are hot enough where large uncertainties associated with complex molecular bands are not present .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in table [ tab : deb_rad_core ] seem large enough to encompass the actual value .",

    "this idea has continually motivated modelers to freely adjust the convective mixing length . however , while mlt is not entirely realistic and allows for such an arbitrary choice of the mixing length , arbitrary reduction without a definite physical motivation ( other than providing better empirical agreement ) is not wholly satisfying .",
    "glossing over the specific reasons for mixing length reduction does not fully illuminate the reasons for the noted discrepancies .    instead of applying an arbitrary adjustment to the convective mixing length , we modify the convective mixing length parameter according to the relation developed by @xcite . using asteroseismic data",
    ", they provide a relation between the mixing length parameter and stellar physical properties ( i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath2 , and [ m / h ] ) .",
    "their formulation indicates that convection is less efficient ( smaller mixing length ) in low - mass , metal - poor stars as compared to the solar case . modifications to the convective mixing length are , therefore , no longer arbitrary and may not take on any value that happens to allow the models to fit a particular case .",
    "the @xcite relation is based on models using an eddington @xmath56 relation to derive the surface boundary conditions , meaning they require a solar calibrated mixing length of 1.69 .",
    "our use of phoenix model atmosphere structures to derive the surface boundary conditions and treatment of atomic diffusion of helium leads to our higher solar calibrated mixing length of @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore use the @xcite relation to derive the relative difference between the empirically derived mixing length and their solar calibrated value , keeping their fit coefficients fixed .",
    "new mixing lengths for the stars in uv psc are scaled from our solar mixing length using this relative difference . for a metallicity of @xmath51dex",
    ", we find a mixing length of @xmath58 for the primary and @xmath59 for the secondary of uv psc .",
    "resulting mass tracks are shown in figure  [ fig : uvpsc_amlt ] . directly altering convection in this manner",
    "does not provide an adequate solution . reducing the mixing length inflates both of the stellar radii ( figure [ fig : uvpsc_amlt](a ) ) and forces the temperature at the photosphere to decrease",
    "( see figure [ fig : uvpsc_amlt](b ) ) .",
    "the mixing length primarily affects the outer layers of each star , where energy is transported by super - adiabatic convection .",
    "a lower mixing length implies that there is less energy flux across a given surface within the convection zone .",
    "since the star must remain in equilibrium , the outer layers puff up to increase the energy flux , thereby reducing the effective temperature .    inflating",
    "the primary component means the models of the secondary must now agree with the observed properties at an age younger than 7.2 gyr .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : uvpsc_amlt](a ) , where the vertical shaded area anchoring the system s age to uv psc a is shifted left of where it was in figure  [ fig : uvpsc_nmag](a ) by 0.5gyr .",
    "a weaker magnetic field is now required to alleviate the radius disagreement with the secondary due to inflation caused by a reduced mixing length .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvpsc_amlt](a ) shows a magnetic model with a surface magnetic field strength of 3.0 kg .",
    "we do not find agreement between the model and empirical radius , but more importantly , figure  [ fig : uvpsc_amlt](b ) demonstrates that the secondary s effective temperature is too cool . increasing the surface magnetic field strength to produce agreement in the age - radius plane would only worsen the lack of agreement in the @xmath2-radius plane .",
    "thus , reducing the mixing length is unable to provide relief to the magnetic over - suppression of the effective temperature in figure [ fig : uvpsc_feh_b](b ) .",
    "we must seek another method to rectify the effective temperature of the magnetic model .",

    "updating our adopted metallicity ( and consequently , the helium abundance ) has a non - negligible effect the structure and evolution of the uv psc components .",
    "stars with masses above @xmath60 are similarly affected by altering the chemical composition .",
    "for example , increasing the metallicity , and therefore the helium abundance , will increase the stellar radii and decrease the effective temperature .",
    "this is a result of changes to the _ p - p _ chain energy generation rate due to helium and the influence of both helium and heavy metals on bound - free radiative opacity .    adopting a lower metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath61 ,",
    "while maintaining a solar calibrated @xmath62 , for uv psc increases the effective temperature of both standard model components and shrinks their radii at younger ages . doing so also removes the effective temperature agreement between models and observations of uv psc a. these effects are demonstrated for standard models in figures  [ fig : uvpsc_nmag](a ) and ( b ) , where we have plotted mass tracks with [ fe / h ] @xmath61 . accurately reproducing the observed stellar properties now requires use of magnetic models for _ both _ components .",

    "mass tracks including a magnetic field are shown in figure [ fig : cu_cnc_mag ] .",

    "the perturbation age was pushed to 100myr when using a 3.5 kg model to ensure model convergence immediately following the perturbation .",
    "we performed numerical tests to confirm that altering the perturbation age does not influence results along the ms .",

    "however , the 2.5 kg model extends the maximum age from 6gyr to 10gyr . unlike models of the secondary , neither of the magnetic models of the primary produce agreement near the zams . instead , agreement is obtained between 900myr and 6gyr . to create agreement between the model and observed radius near the zams , our models would require a stronger surface magnetic field strength .    the need for a stronger magnetic field in the primary depends on the real age of the system .",
    "@xcite invoked the possible cmg membership to estimate an age .",
    "the cmg is thought to be approximately 350  400 myr ( see section [ sec : yygem ] ) .",

    "this can be readily explained by the depth of the convective envelope in the stars of cu cnc . at @xmath100 ,",
    "the stars are expected to have deep convection zones that extend from the stellar surface down to about 55% of the stellar radius .",
    "lithium is destroyed ( @xmath101 k ) at a depth located considerably closer to the stellar surface than the convection zone boundary .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : li7_burn ] .",
    "lithium will be mixed down to the base of the convection zone where it will rapidly burn , leading to a complete absence of lithium by 20myr . introducing a strong magnetic field ( 3.5 kg )",
    "reduces the size of the convection zone in cu cnc a by 7% and by 9% in cu cnc b. in contrast , to preserve lithium the size of the convection zone would have to be reduced by nearly 30% .",
    "this corresponds to the base of the convection zone moving from 55% to 70% of the total stellar radius .",

    "a search of the _ rosat _ bright source catalogue for castor a and b yield the same data as is found when searching for yy gem , indicating that _ rosat _ can not spatially resolve these three systems .",
    "castor a and b are both binaries , thought to have m - dwarfs companions , meaning that _ rosat _ is detecting x - ray emission from up to six sources .",
    "similarly , cu cnc has a @xmath144 companion , cv cnc , another m - dwarf binary system .",
    "both systems are likely contributing to the @xmath143 listed in the _ rosat _ bright source catalogue .",
    "distances to the systems are calculated using updated _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite , except for yy gem , for which no parallax is available .",
    "instead , we adopt a distance of @xmath145 pc , which has been estimated from earlier investigations @xcite .",
    "the distances allow for the calculation of the total x - ray luminosity per star , which we quote in table [ tab : rad_rosat ] .    our estimates for the deb surface magnetic fluxes , surface magnetic field strengths , and their associated errors",
    "are given in table [ tab : rad_bfield ] .",
    "we also include the surface magnetic field strengths required by our models for comparison .",
    "the x - ray data reveal that the magnetic field strengths required by our models are probably too strong .",
    "we demonstrate this visually by the dark blue diamond symbols in figure [ fig : lx_mx_rad ] .",
    "since the magnetic models reproduce the observed stellar radii , the surface area of the model is equal to the observed stellar surface area .",
    "thus , the larger magnetic fluxes observed from the models suggest the magnetic field strengths are too strong .",
    "the data suggest that the only realistic magnetic field strengths may be those of uv psc . however , the data points for uv psc lie outside the domain of the empirical data set . whether this extrapolation is valid",
    "remains unclear .",
    "even if we assume the extrapolation is valid , uv psc b lies just above the @xmath146 error bounds of the linear correlation .",
    "conversely , uv psc a lies just inside the boundary .",
    "we must therefore be cautious with our interpretation of the accuracy of our models for uv psc .",
    "this is further reinforced by noting that only two g - dwarfs ( the spectral type of uv psc a ) were included in the data set and are therefore under represented .",
    "direct measurements of g - dwarf surface magnetic field strengths show they are around @xmath147 g @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the surface magnetic field strength derived for uv psc a from the x - ray luminosity relation , but inconsistent with our model predictions .",
    "what is clear from figure [ fig : lx_mx_rad ] and table [ tab : rad_bfield ] is that the magnetic field strengths required by the models are too strong for the stars in yy gem and cu cnc .",
    "the models of yy gem need a magnetic field strength that are a factor of six too strong .",
    "similarly large magnetic fields are needed by the models for the stars of cu cnc .",
    "taking a more qualitative approach , the magnetic field strengths required by our models for yy gem and cu cnc appear within the realm of possibility . numerous studies of m - dwarfs find that surface magnetic strengths of a few kilogauss are quite common @xcite .",
    "however , these debs would then have noticeably stronger magnetic fields for their observed x - ray luminosity than the rest of m - dwarf population .",

    "there is currently no reliable method for measuring the magnetic field strengths present inside stars .",
    "therefore , we elect to compare the theoretical magnetic field strengths required by our models with those predicted by 3d mhd models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "table [ tab : int_fs ] presents the peak interior magnetic field strengths for the models presented above for both the dipole and the gaussian field profiles ( see below ) .",

    "* ) . in the immediate context , `` solar - like ''",
    "is loosely taken to mean stars with a radiative core and a solar - like rotation profile .",
    "the peak magnetic field strengths of our models appear consistent with those predicted from 3d mhd models . furthermore , while helioseismic investigations have yet to reveal the interior magnetic field profile for our sun , initial indications suggest the peak magnetic field strength is below @xmath152 kg @xcite .",
    "estimates place the strengths in the vicinity of several tens of kg @xcite .      given the results that the model surface field strengths are likely too strong , we seek to reformulate our magnetic perturbation .",
    "we first consider some of the assumptions used to formulate our magnetic models presented in @xcite and used in section [ sec : ind_deb ] .",
    "we have identified three key assumptions : ( 1 ) our prescribed magnetic field radial profile , ( 2 ) that convective elements are spherical and that the plasma obeys the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , and ( 3 ) that the dynamo is driven completely by rotation .      in the models presented up to this point ,",
    "we have followed the formulation described in @xcite .",
    "there , we arbitrarily assumed that the magnetic field strength radial profile was a dipole configuration falling off as @xmath153 from a pre - defined peak field strength location .",
    "the location of the peak magnetic field strength was taken to be at the base of the convective envelope , nominally the stellar tachocline .",
    "note that in fully convective objects , the peak magnetic field strength is located at @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to reduce the required surface magnetic field strengths if we instead use steeper radial profile .",
    "this would produce a stronger magnetic field at the tachocline for a given surface magnetic field strength .    to this end",
    ", we define a gaussian radial profile .",
    "the tachocline is still the location of the peak magnetic field strength , now defined to be the peak of a gaussian distribution .",
    "the radial profile is then defined by @xmath155\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the width of the gaussian and @xmath157 is the radial location of the tachocline .",
    "the adopted width of the gaussian is arbitrary . in most applications",
    ", it would be reasonable to set the width of the gaussian to a constant value .",
    "for instance , a value of @xmath158 was favored by @xcite . however , since we will be considering stars with varying convection zone depths ( not only the sun as in * ? ? ? * ) , we felt a single value would not be appropriate .",
    "instead , we define @xmath156 as a function of the convection zone depth .",
    "this allows us to localize the magnetic field in thin convection zones and distribute the magnetic field in fully convective stars , thereby maintaining seemingly realistic values for the peak magnetic field strength ( see table [ tab : int_fs ] ) .",
    "the width of the gaussian was fixed to @xmath158 in fully convective objects and @xmath159 in the sun .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath160 a direct comparison of the shape of the magnetic field profiles used in this study is given in figure [ fig : rad_prof ] .",
    "two masses are shown to make clear the variable width of the gaussian .",
    "figure [ fig : gau_dip ] illustrates the influence of using the gaussian radial profile .",
    "we plot the relative difference in the radius evolution between the gaussian and dipole radial profiles for a series of stellar masses .",
    "all of the models have an equivalent surface magnetic field strength of 2.0 kg and a solar metallicity . despite the increased magnetic field strength at the tachocline ( see table [ tab : int_fs ] and figure [ fig : gau_dip ] ) , using a gaussian radial profile instead of a dipole profile has a largely sub-1% effect on model radius predictions .",
    "therefore , we find no compelling reason to alter our default field strength profile .    two additional comments on the results presented in figure [ fig : gau_dip ] .",
    "first , the two radial profiles produce similar results despite the peak magnetic field strengths differing by about an order of magnitude .",
    "it would seem that the deep interior field strength is relatively unimportant in stars with radiative cores .",
    "instead , the surface magnetic field strength appears to be primarily responsible for driving the radius inflation .",
    "this is consistent with the previous study by @xcite .    to understand why",
    ", we plot the difference between the temperature gradient of the ambient plasma , @xmath161 , and the adiabatic gradient , @xmath162 , as a function of density in figure [ fig : del_dela ] .",
    "consider the non - magnetic model .",
    "when the line dips below the zero point , radiation carries all of the excess energy .",
    "near the stellar surface , where the density , @xmath163 , is small , @xmath161 is noticeably super - adiabatic , indicative of inefficient convective energy transport .",
    "deeper in the star , where @xmath164 , the temperature gradient is super - adiabatic , but only slightly ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "this suggests convective energy transport is highly efficient .",
    "our magnetic field implementation modifies @xmath162 by a factor proportional to @xmath166 , where @xmath167 in equation ( [ eq : nu_delx ] ) , @xmath168 at constant @xmath169 and @xmath170 , a magnetic compression coefficient , and @xmath171 is the gradient of the magnetic energy per unit mass , @xmath172 , with respect to the total pressure , @xmath169 ( also see equation ( [ eq : fc12_nu ] ) ) .",
    "deep in the stellar interior , @xmath173 , and @xmath174  @xmath175 .",
    "this is not sufficient to inhibit convection deep within the star",
    ". the exact situation can be more complicated and is discussed further in section [ sec : disc ] . near the surface",
    ", however , any inhibition of convection causes a steepening of @xmath161 , forcing radiation to carry more energy .",
    "we then expect to see a growth of the region near the stellar surface where radiation carries all of the flux , as is seen in figure [ fig : del_dela ] .",
    "the structural changes caused by the steep temperature gradient near the surface are enough to reconcile the models with the observations before the deep interior magnetic field strength becomes appreciable in magnitude so as to inhibit convection .",
    "therefore , the outward movement of the convection zone boundary occurs largely as a response to changes near the stellar surface .",
    "next , we see in figure [ fig : gau_dip ] that the @xmath12 track displays a sharp upturn near 1 gyr .",
    "the model is too young to be undergoing rapid evolutionary changes .",
    "instead , we believe this is related to the physical properties of the star near the boundary of the convection zone",
    ". as we just discussed , the magnetic field strengths for both profiles are typically too weak near the tachocline to affect stellar structure",
    ". however , this is not true for a @xmath12 model .",
    "the convection zone is thin and convection is generally super - adiabatic throughout .",
    "this results in the gaussian radial profile having a stronger effect on the properties of convection .",
    "we now also see why the gaussian radial profile has a weaker influence on the stellar radius as we decrease the stellar mass .",
    "convection in the deep interior becomes more adiabatic ( re : efficient ) at lower masses .",
    "the technique advanced by @xcite introduces a number of free parameters that govern the interaction between an imposed magnetic field and the stellar plasma .",
    "one of these parameters , @xmath177 , governs the amount of pressure exerted on the plasma by a magnetic field and was investigated in @xcite .",
    "another parameter , @xmath176 , controls the relationship between the magnetic energy gradient of a convecting element and that of the surrounding plasma .",
    "physically , @xmath176 is related to the geometry of the convecting element and the conductivity of the plasma .",
    "for instance , assuming that convecting elements are spherical and that the plasma is infinitely conducting , we found that @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "although stellar interiors may be considered , for all practical purposes , infinitely conducting , this is not necessarily the case in the stellar envelope .",
    "changing @xmath176 so that it is no longer fixed to 1 introduces an additional term in the convective buoyancy equation . this term can either increase or decrease the buoyancy force felt by a convecting element , depending on the sign of the plasma magnetic energy gradient and the precise value of @xmath176 ( see equation ( 57 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our studies ,",
    "the magnetic energy gradient is decreasing toward the model center throughout the stellar envelope .",
    "thus , decreasing @xmath176 from 1 slows the buoyant motion of a convective element thereby reducing the convective flux .    instead of attempting to physically motivate a value for @xmath176",
    ", we take the approach of testing an extremal value . by setting @xmath179",
    "we maximize the lorentz force term mentioned above , given our radial profile .",
    "results of changing the value of @xmath176 from @xmath180 to @xmath179 are shown in figure [ fig : f_par ] . as with figure",
    "[ fig : gau_dip ] , we plot the relative difference in the radius evolution for a series of mass tracks .",
    "all of the models were calculated with a @xmath63 kg magnetic field and a dipole field profile ( see the previous section ) .",
    "the largest mass model shown is @xmath181 as models with larger masses failed to converge for a @xmath63 kg magnetic field with @xmath182 .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : f_par ] that lowering the value of @xmath176 can have a significant impact on the model radius evolution .",
    "differences between 2% and 9% were observed , depending on the mass of the model .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to study the effect of setting @xmath179 on the individual deb stars discussed above .    setting @xmath182 reduced the magnetic field strengths required to reconcile model radii by about half .",
    "the model of yy gem , for instance , only requires a surface magnetic field strength of 2.5 kg compared to the 4.3 kg required with @xmath183 .",
    "however , the reduced surface magnetic field strengths are still too strong compared with values estimated from x - ray emission .",
    "models of uv psc are in better agreement with the x - ray predicted values , but we have already given reasons to be skeptical of these predictions .",
    "whether or not we have reason to believe that @xmath176 should be zero is a more difficult question . geometric considerations about convecting elements",
    "have long been debated in standard mlt , but they ultimately have little impact on model predictions @xcite .",
    "however , when considering magnetic mlt , convective element geometry may come to matter .",
    "quantifying the effects of plasma conductivity on @xmath176 is far more difficult .",
    "it is safe to assume that the stellar plasma is highly conducting throughout a majority of the stellar interior , where temperatures exceed @xmath184k and hydrogen is completely ionized .",
    "near the surface , free electrons from hydrogen ionization are no longer available , meaning conductivity is decreased , but not necessarily zero .",
    "free electrons from other species ( e.g. , ca and na ) keep the plasma at least partially conducting . physically motivating an expression for @xmath176 in terms of the plasma conductivity and convective bubble geometry would be a worthwhile endeavor .",
    "we plan to investigate this in a future study .",
    "ultimately , we have shown that the value of @xmath176 , while of consequence , does provide enough leverage to bring our models into agreement with the observations using realistic surface magnetic field strengths .",
    "the final assumption that we identified was that the magnetic field is `` driven '' completely by rotation .",
    "by doing so , we have allowed for the unintended consequence that the magnetic field strength  both the surface and the interior  can grow without limit .",
    "there is no natural limit imposed upon the field strengths as the mechanism from which the field is drawing energy ( i.e. , rotation ) is neglected entirely .    limiting the magnetic field strengths , however ,",
    "does not alter the ease by which a magnetic field can induce stellar inflation .",
    "what it can do is validate or invalidate the required surface magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , if we reconsider the physical source of the magnetic field , it can lead to new methods of including magnetic fields in stellar evolution codes .",
    "there are questions as to whether the solar magnetic field is generated at the tachocline by the strong shear induced by rotation ( i.e. , the standard parker model ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or if it is primarily generated within the solar convection zone by turbulent convection without explicit need for a tachocline @xcite .",
    "generation of a magnetic field from turbulent convection would suppress convective velocity fluctuations thereby reducing the total heat flux transported by convection .",
    "early three - dimensional magneto - convection simulations support this assessment @xcite . given that thick convective envelopes are a ubiquitous feature of low - mass stars ,",
    "it is not unreasonable to posit that suppressing the total heat flux transported by convection would strongly impact stellar structure .    assuming that the magnetic field sources its energy directly from the kinetic energy of turbulent convection has important consequences for a magnetic theory of convection .",
    "consider a single convecting bubble .",
    "if the bubble is traveling with some velocity , @xmath185 , it has a kinetic energy equal to @xmath186 , where @xmath163 is the mass density of the plasma . now , suppose some of that kinetic energy is used to generate the local magnetic field . by conservation of energy , we must have that @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the convective velocity after generation of a magnetic field and the final term is the magnetic energy .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that a characteristic convecting bubble is responsible for generating the magnetic field only in its vicinity .",
    "this local treatment is a purely phenomenological approach and gives an upper limit to the effects of a turbulent dynamo , but provides a reasonable zeroth - order approximation within the framework of mlt .",
    "the result is that the characteristic convective bubble will have a lower velocity in the presence of a magnetic field , @xmath189 the last term on the right hand side is equal the square of the local alfvn velocity , @xmath190 the diversion of energy into the magnetic field can significantly reduce the total convective flux , as the convective flux is proportional to @xmath191 .",
    "this reduction in convective flux forces the radiative temperature gradient to grow steeper by an amount proportional to @xmath192 .    to include these effects , we re - derived the equations of mlt given in @xcite .",
    "the convective velocity and convective flux were modified to account for the loss of energy to the magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to find convergence when numerically solving the system of equations .",
    "closer inspection of the coefficients in our new quartic equation ( see equation ( 65 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed that there was no real root in the outer portions of the stellar envelope .",
    "the low density present in the envelope drives up @xmath192 , causing the range of our final equation to lie above zero for all real values of the convective velocity .",
    "we also attempted to modify the `` non - adiabaticity '' equation ( equation ( 58 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so as to model the transformation of turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy as an effective heat loss . however , we were again unable to obtain convergence for the resulting quartic equation .",
    "we are continuing the investigate this issue .",
    "instead , we opted to first solve the mlt equations as normal and then modify the results to mimic the conversion of turbulent kinetic energy to magnetic energy .",
    "the convective velocity is reduced by the alfvn velocity , as in equation ( [ eq : u_conv_t ] ) .",
    "while energy is transferred to the magnetic field , we assume that the energy is still confined to the local region under consideration , thereby reducing the total flux of energy across the region . assuming that energy flux is conserved",
    ", radiation must attempt to carry additional energy flux .",
    "this leads to an increase in the local temperature gradient of the ambient plasma that is proportional to the total energy removed from the convecting element .",
    "specifically , @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the characteristic squared velocity of an unimpeded convecting bubble over a pressure scale height ( @xmath195 ) . in the definition of @xmath196 , we find the local gravitational acceleration @xmath197 , the convective mixing length parameter @xmath11 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion @xmath198 .",
    "increasing the temperature excess increases the buoyancy of a convective element , increasing its velocity .",
    "however , for now , we concern ourselves only with the simple first - order approximation and neglect the immediate feedback on the convective velocity .",
    "we again compute a series of models using this new modified mlt and compare the relative differences in radius evolution to our original formulation .",
    "these tracks are shown in figure [ fig : mlt_new_ab ] .",
    "we assume a @xmath147 g surface magnetic field strength with a dipole radial profile and @xmath180 .",
    "stabilization of convection , or a modified schwarzschild criterion , is neglected , leaving only the reduction of convective flux to influence the convective properties .",
    "the @xmath181 , @xmath0 , and @xmath199 tracks in figure [ fig : mlt_new_ab ] show slightly different characteristics .",
    "models assuming a turbulent dynamo readjusted to the presence of the magnetic field at an older age than did the models with the rotational dynamo . despite appearances ,",
    "all perturbations were introduced at an age of @xmath200 gyr .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig : mlt_new_ab ] that this new method of handling magneto - convection can significantly reduce the surface magnetic field strength required to inflate model radii .",
    "we recomputed models for uv psc , yy gem , and cu cnc using the best fit metallicities found in section [ sec : ind_deb ] .",
    "we were able to achieve model convergence for the stars in yy gem and cu cnc .",
    "models of the stars in uv psc with surface magnetic fields greater than @xmath201 g , required to correct the model radii , did not converge .",
    "we also recomputed models for @xcite , but ran into the same convergence issues .",
    "we are continuing to investigate this issue .",
    "the resulting magnetic field strengths required for yy gem and cu cnc a and b were @xmath202 kg , @xmath202 kg , and @xmath203 kg , respectively .",
    "the surface magnetic field strengths derived from sourcing the magnetic field energy from convection are nearly identical to the value estimated from x - ray emission .",
    "this agreement lends credence to our latest approach , at least for lower mass models .",
    "we found it difficult to attain model convergence using this approach for models with masses greater than about @xmath204 .",
    "stronger magnetic fields were required than could be achieved with the present model configuration .",
    "this was a consequence of the alfvn velocity exceeding the convective velocity at some point within the convective envelope .",
    "below that approximate mass limit the turbulent dynamo approach can inflate stellar radii with relative ease compared to our original formulation . whether this is indicative of the actual dynamo processes acting in each star",
    "is not clear .",
    "it is thought that the dynamo mechanism begins shifting from a rotationally driven dynamo to a turbulent dynamo somewhere around @xmath205 ( early - m ; pg .  228 in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which would suggest yy gem has a predominantly rotational dynamo .",
    "we explore possible tests to delineate between the two processes using stellar models in the next section .",
    "section [ sec : des ] presents a second approach to modeling the effects of magnetic fields on thermal convection . instead of acting to stabilize convection through the modification of the schwarzschild criterion ,",
    "the method acts to reduce the efficiency of convection .",
    "ultimately , the two approaches represent different physical mechanisms by which a star may produce its magnetic field .",
    "a dynamo that sources its energy primarily from rotation will act to stabilize convection and will not drain the energy from convective elements . on the other hand , a turbulent dynamo will tend to exhaust the kinetic energy available from convection .",
    "the magnetic field created by a turbulent dynamo may also act to stabilize convection , but this effect is secondary in our models .",
    "the magnetic field strengths required to inflate a star following the turbulent dynamo approach are considerably weaker than those required when assuming a rotationally driven dynamo . given the two different mechanisms that may be producing stellar magnetic fields , it is worth exploring whether or not the two approach produce any discernible differences between two otherwise identical stars .",
    "we have found the surface magnetic field strengths will be different , but is the stellar interior structure different between the two ?",
    "figure [ fig : int_prof ] shows the run of density within three different model interiors : one standard , non - magnetic model and two magnetic models with different dynamo methods .",
    "each model was computed with a mass of @xmath206 , a metallicity of @xmath207 dex , and evolved to an age of 360 myr  the properties of the yy gem stars .",
    "the non - magnetic model has a radius smaller than the actual radius of the yy gem ( here considered a single star ) .",
    "surface magnetic field strengths used in the magnetic models were those required to reconcile model radii with observations ( @xmath138 kg and @xmath202 kg for the @xcite prescription and turbulent dynamo , respectively ) .",
    "overall , introducing a magnetic field causes the density profile to steepen within the models with little to no change in the central density .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : int_prof ] , the magneto - convection methods produce identical results ( the two lines are lying on top of one another ) despite having different magnetic field strengths throughout . only near the surface of the model ( outer 0.2% by radius ) do the two methods produce noticeable differences .",
    "we compared the sound speed profiles of the three models , as well , and found similar results .",
    "the two magnetic models were characterized by slower sound speed throughout compared to the standard model ( as expected since they show lower densities ) .",
    "differences between the two magnetic models were again noted in the outermost layers , where the sound speed of the turbulent dynamo model followed the sound speed of the non - magnetic model before deviating and tracking the rotational dynamo model throughout the rest of the model interior .",
    "even if one could perform seismology on stars in this mass range , differences in the outermost layers would be unobservable .",
    "thus , for all practical purposes , the two magnetic models produce identical results .",
    "finally , we confirmed that the radius to the convection zone boundary was equivalent in the magnetic models . in the non - magnetic model ,",
    "the convection zone boundary was located at @xmath208 , but it receded to @xmath209 and @xmath210 for the magnetic models .",
    "therefore , it appears that the only way to differentiate between the two proposed methods is to measure a star s surface magnetic field strength .",
    "similar methods for incorporating the effects of a magnetic field have been performed previously .",
    "these previous studies have separately looked at magnetic stabilization of convection @xcite and the reduction of convective efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results presented in this paper with those earlier studies .",
    "qualitatively , our initial approach to modeling the magnetic interaction with convection @xcite is very similar to the method favored by @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath211 , a `` magnetic compression coefficient , '' appearing in our modified schwarzschild criterion ( equation ( 53 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is essentially equal to the @xcite convective inhibition parameter , @xmath212 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath213 comparing with the magnetic inhibition parameter presented by @xcite , @xmath214 where @xmath177 , the ratio of specific heats , is of order unity .",
    "their formulation is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "one significant difference is that our approach introduces a magnetic energy gradient , @xmath171 , in the stability criterion .",
    "this gradient determines how the magnetic field , characterized by @xmath211 , interacts with convection .",
    "the @xmath171 term appears in our equations because we allow the magnetic pressure gradient to influence the equilibrium density ( equation ( 34 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite restricted themselves to simple field geometries in a medium with uniform density .",
    "it is for this reason that we favor our approach and the inclusion of @xmath171 in the stability criterion .",
    "figure [ fig : logxlogp ] shows how the magnetic energy varies as a function of pressure for our two radial profiles .",
    "immediately it can be seen that the two profiles differ significantly near the base of the convection zone around @xmath215 . throughout a large portion of the convection zone ,",
    "the gradient is dominated not by the magnetic field radial profile , but by the density profile .",
    "density increases steeply with radius in the outer regions of the star . since @xmath216 ( @xmath217 )",
    "is inversely proportional to density , we see a decrease in @xmath216 in the outer layers . a negative gradient in figure [ fig : logxlogp ]",
    "implies that the magnetic field has a stabilizing effect on convection .",
    "since the gradient in density dominates , the effect of magneto - convection is rather independent of the radial profile ( so long as the magnetic field is an increasing function of depth from the surface ) .",
    "deeper in the star , where the two radial profiles begin to deviate , we see that there is a change in slope for the gaussian profile . in this region ,",
    "the magnetic field strength gradient begins to dominate .",
    "since the dipole profile has a shallower slope through the interior the change in slope occurs deeper in the star .",
    "a positive magnetic energy gradient in figure [ fig : logxlogp ] has a destabilizing effect on convection  convection becomes more favorable .",
    "however , since this change in slope occurs within an already convectively unstable region , the overall effect on stellar structure is minimal .",
    "one may then postulate that the dipole profile , with it s almost continuous negative magnetic energy gradient should induce larger changes on stellar structure .",
    "but , to maintain a negative slope the magnetic field strength can not rise too rapidly , meaning the value of @xmath211 remains small .",
    "given our model s dependence on @xmath171 in the stability criterion , we expect our required magnetic field strengths to be about a factor of 25 larger than those required by @xcite .",
    "subsequent works incorporating the @xcite magnetic inhibition parameter do not explicitly model any of the three systems we have presented ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , drawing from the general conclusions of those works , it appears that they regularly require surface magnetic field strengths of about 0.5 kg to produce models consistent with observations .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude less than what we have presented in section [ sec : ind_deb ] using our original method @xcite .",
    "only part of this difference can be accounted for by our inclusion of @xmath171 in the stability criterion .",
    "the rest of the difference may result from our incorporation of the magnetic field in the density equation of state .",
    "additional tests must be carried out to assess the various contributions to these differences .",
    "the tactic used in section [ sec : des ] has attempted to quantify a reduction in convective efficiency .",
    "@xcite had previously explored this concept , although they did so by arbitrarily reducing @xmath11 .",
    "although reducing @xmath11 can be considered conceptually different from our approach in section [ sec : des ] , the two are remarkably similar .    convective efficiency can be defined using the framework of mlt by considering heat losses that are `` horizontal '' to the radial motion of a bubble @xcite .",
    "the efficiency , @xmath218 , can be expressed as @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath221 is the radiation constant , @xmath222 is the speed of light in a vacuum , and @xmath223 is the opacity . since the convective efficiency is proportional to both @xmath188 and @xmath11 , we may compare reductions in @xmath188 with the reductions in @xmath11 used by @xcite .    consider a reduction in @xmath188 caused by a magnetic field that has a strength that is some fraction , @xmath224 , of the equipartition field strength , @xmath225",
    ". then the ratio of the convective efficiency in the presence of a magnetic field to the non - magnetic efficiency is @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , to achieve the same results by reducing @xmath11 , we need only multiply the solar @xmath11 by @xmath227 .",
    "we then find that @xmath228^{1/2}.      \\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ] this assumes that the convective velocity is unaffected by changes in mixing length .",
    "allowing for changes in convective velocity , the exponent on the mixing length term in equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) can be larger .",
    "we now have a quantitative description of the degeneracy between magnetic inhibition of convection and reducing the convective mixing length @xcite in terms of a fraction of the equipartition magnetic field strength .",
    "@xcite considered multiple values for @xmath11 , including @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "these drastically reduced @xmath11 values correspond to @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "we find that our models do require such strong magnetic fields , at least in the outer layers .",
    "the model of yy gem in section [ sec : des ] has @xmath233 throughout a large portion of the outer envelope . @xmath224",
    "decreases from @xmath234 at the photosphere ( where @xmath235 ) to @xmath236 at the point where we match the envelope to the interior .",
    "this is the result of prescribing a magnetic field radial profile that is independent of @xmath224 .    to make the comparison more direct , we compare the interior structure of the magnetic model with that from a reduced @xmath11 model .",
    "our models required @xmath237 to reproduce the observed radius of yy gem , corresponding to @xmath238 , for reference .",
    "based on figure 1(a ) of @xcite it appears that they require @xmath239 to reproduce the properties of yy gem .",
    "we compare the density distribution of our reduced @xmath11 and magnetic model in figure [ fig : int_amlt_prof ] .",
    "we find no significant difference .",
    "it is apparent that our magnetic model produces results consistent with reduced @xmath11 models .      up to this point",
    "we have avoided any mention of specifically incorporating effects due to star spots .",
    "previous magnetic investigations have accounted for dark spots by reducing the total flux at the model photosphere @xcite .",
    "reductions of photospheric flux were combined with the aforementioned magneto - convection techniques to reconcile model radii with observations of debs @xcite . however , as we have shown , our models do not explicitly require spots to produce agreement with observations .",
    "this can be understood by considering that there is a degeneracy between effects due to spots and effects due to magneto - convection @xcite .",
    "generally , the total flux leaving the model photosphere is reduced . by including spots , magnetic field strengths required by the models to reproduce observations",
    "would be decreased .",
    "we elected to not include spots explicitly for two reasons : ( 1 ) spots are the manifestation of inhibited , or suppressed , convection , and ( 2 ) average surface magnetic field strengths are more easily measured than spot properties",
    ".    spots are surface blemishes caused by a reduction in convective energy transport .",
    "therefore , we are of the opinion that modeling effects of magnetic fields on convection is a more direct way to model effects from spots .",
    "convective properties required by our models represent the average global properties of convection , producing a convective flux that is between the increased convective flux in unspotted areas and the reduced convective flux below spots .    possibly of greater importance , however , is that surface magnetic field strengths are directly observable",
    ". if effects of spots on stellar structure are distinct from magneto - convection formulations , differences should appear between measured surface magnetic field strengths and those required by stellar models .",
    "the problem with immediately including spots is that required spot properties are difficult to validate , especially for m - dwarfs . including spots in stellar models",
    "requires the specification of a free parameter that describes a surface coverage of black ( @xmath240k ) spots equivalent to a desired surface coverage of gray ( @xmath241k ) spots @xcite . measuring",
    "either the effective coverage of black spots or the actual coverage of gray spots on real stars is a highly uncertain process .",
    "therefore , it may be better to probe whether spots must be considered independently from magneto - convection by comparing pure magneto - convection models to magnetic field observations to look for discrepancies between surface magnetic field strengths .      figure [ fig : int_prof ] showed that magnetic models have a lower density throughout their interior than do non - magnetic models .",
    "this is not unexpected if we consider that the magnetic field acts to inflate the radius of the model .",
    "however , the reduction in mass density throughout the stellar interior affects the sound speed profile , which has implications for seismic analyses .",
    "we plot the sound speed profile for two @xmath242 models in figure [ fig : dcs_rad ] .",
    "the sound speed is defined as @xmath243 where @xmath169 is the total pressure ( gas + radiation + magnetic ) and @xmath163 is the mass density . using the total pressure to define the sound speed will suffice for exploratory purposes .",
    "the models have a scaled - solar composition of [ fe / h ] = @xmath244 dex .",
    "one model has a magnetic field with a surface field strength of @xmath202 kg using the turbulent dynamo formulation .",
    "note that the density profile for these two models are shown in figure [ fig : int_prof ] .    comparing the sound speed between the two models",
    ", we see that the magnetic model has a sound speed that is slower by about 5% .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ fig : dcs_rad ] shows the relative sound speed difference between the two models with respect to the non - magnetic models .",
    "we define @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the sound speed in the non - magnetic model and @xmath247 is that for the magnetic model .",
    "the change in sound speed between the two models affects the @xmath248-mode frequencies and frequency spacing , which consequently alters the interpretation of seismic data .",
    "imagine that observational data is obtained for a @xmath242 star that has a @xmath202 kg magnetic field .",
    "these two facts about the star are unknown to the observer . instead",
    ", the observer has taken great care to obtain high resolution spectra with sufficiently high signal - to - noise . from this data",
    "they are able to ascertain the effective temperature , @xmath2 , and the approximate composition .",
    "they also have precise photometric data that allows for a seismic analysis . to first order",
    ", they are able to obtain the stellar radius from the large frequency splittings .",
    "the properties they derive for the star are @xmath249 , @xmath250 k , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath251 .    with these properties , what inferences would the observer make about the star ?",
    "using a grid of non - magnetic dartmouth models @xcite the observer would estimate the mass of the star to be roughly @xmath252 . or",
    "approximately 10% larger than the actual mass .",
    "the age of the star would be difficult to estimate in this particular case due to the lack of significant radius evolution of low - mass stars on the ms .",
    "one concession , is that the models would not match the observed @xmath2 within the @xmath146 limit quoted above .",
    "however , one can easily find a match within @xmath253 .",
    "moreover , the sound speed profiles between the higher mass non - magnetic models and the lower mass magnetic models are quite similar .    as we have seen in section [ sec :",
    "yygem ] , given a radius , @xmath2 , and metallicity , one should be able to derive the appropriate mass for this star . with magnetic models , a slight degeneracy in mass and magnetic field strength",
    "would be introduced , as varying the magnetic field at a given mass can alter the radius and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the true solution would be encompassed by the formal uncertainties .",
    "regardless , it will be more accurate than if only non - magnetic models were used .",
    "future investigations exploring the effects of a magnetic perturbation on the pulsation analysis and the use of magnetic models for mass determinations are warranted .",
    "while the case above was exploratory and does not represent the typical stars selected for asteroseismic analysis , the conclusions should be valid for all stars with an outer convective envelope .",
    "magnetically active stars are also not favored for asteroseismology .",
    "there are issues with removing possible photometric variations due to spots . however , the lack of photometric variability from spots is not necessarily indicative of an inactive star @xcite .",
    "the primary effect of introducing a magnetic perturbation is that model radii are increased and @xmath2s are decreased .",
    "what has not been discussed is that model luminosities show a marginal decrease .",
    "this means the radius increase does not precisely balance the cooling of the @xmath2 , in contrast with what has been assumed previously ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while there is no luminosity change immediately after the perturbation is introduced , the reduction in luminosity occurs over thermal timescales .",
    "the models readjust their internal structure to compensate for the reduction of convective heat flux .",
    "these changes in the stellar surface properties can influence studies of extra - solar planets ( exoplanets ) around low - mass stars .",
    "transiting exoplanets have radii that are directly proportional to the radii of their host stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . determining",
    "the radius of a low - mass host star is difficult .",
    "interferometry allows for the direct measurement of the stellar radius , but is only available for the brightest ( i.e. , nearest ) targets @xcite .",
    "one could attempt to perform an asteroseismic analysis , but it would suffer due to the intrinsic faintness of low - mass stars and also from the considerable photometric variability that is characteristic of these stars . in lieu of other methods ,",
    "stellar evolution models are often used to aid in the interpretation of transiting exoplanetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "owing to a lack of available magnetic model grids , these studies have relied exclusively on standard stellar evolution models .",
    "the use of magnetic models can have an impact on these studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the metallicity and @xmath2 for the low - mass stars tagged as planet candidates in the _ kepler _ mission @xcite .",
    "they then interpolated within dartmouth isochrones @xcite to determine stellar radii .",
    "had they used magnetic stellar models , for a given @xmath2 , the stellar radius would be larger , with the precise factor dependent on the magnetic field strength assumed . this would result in larger , less dense ( and therefore less earth - like ) planets .    estimating the surface magnetic field is the largest hindrance to using magnetic models .",
    "stars in the _ kepler _ field are typically distant , meaning x - ray measurements will not necessarily be available .",
    "deep observations of the _ kepler _ field with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ could provide x - ray magnetic activity information .",
    "alternatively , it might be feasible to obtain optical spectra and use the h@xmath4 equivalent widths to estimate magnetic activity .",
    "h@xmath4 is less revealing , as we are not aware of a direct relation linking h@xmath4 equivalent widths to magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , it has been shown that h@xmath4 equivalent widths correlate , to some extent , with x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "regardless , the presence of h@xmath4 in emission would be indicative of an active star . at that point",
    ", several magnetic models could be used to constrain the stellar radius .",
    "this paper addressed the question of how the presence of a magnetic field affects the structure of low - mass stars with a radiative core .",
    "we approached this problem by taking a careful look at three deb systems that show significant radius and @xmath2 deviations from standard stellar evolution models . using the magnetic stellar evolution models introduced in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we attempted to reproduce the observational properties of uv psc , yy gem , and cu cnc .    after finding that the magnetic models were able to reconcile the stellar models with the observed radii and @xmath2s ( consistent with the findings of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it was shown in section [ sec : surf_field_str ] that the surface magnetic field strengths were likely too strong .",
    "this was determined by taking the coronal x - ray luminosity as an indirect diagnostic for the surface magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the surface magnetic fields , the interior field strengths are of a plausible magnitude , consistent with the range of field strengths predicted to be within the sun by 3d mhd models @xcite .",
    "we then attempted to reduce the surface magnetic field strengths while still maintaining the newfound agreement between stellar models and deb observations .",
    "the most plausible explanation we uncovered is that kinetic energy in turbulent convective flows is actively converted into magnetic energy . introducing changes to mlt that mimic",
    "this physical process yielded accurate models with surface magnetic field strengths nearly equal to those predicted by x - ray emission .",
    "we were unable , however , to implement this prescription for the stars of uv psc .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the chosen magnetic field profile , which caused the models to fail to converge .",
    "we note that by invoking the `` turbulent dynamo '' approach , we are able to generate substantial radius inflation with relatively modest ( sub - kg ) magnetic fields .    beyond direct comparisons to observational data , we explored additional implications of the present study .",
    "we found that different theoretical descriptions of the physical manifestation of magneto - convection lead to similarly inflated stars and produce nearly identical stellar interiors .",
    "this was evidence by the radial density profile for models invoking the methods presented in @xcite , section [ sec : des ] ( this work ) , and @xcite , which were all nearly identical .",
    "the latter uses a reduced mixing length approach to simulate the introduction of a turbulent dynamo . we provide a variable , @xmath224 , to translate a reduction in mixing length into a magnetic field strength ( normalized to the equipartition field strength , which depends on the convective velocity ) .",
    "we also argue that asteroseismic studies should be relatively unaffected by structural changes in the stellar models .",
    "asteroseismic studies typically know the stellar composition and effective temperature .",
    "anomalous values of the @xmath2 due to magnetic fields should provide a clue that magnetic fields are required . for a given density profile",
    ", it is difficult to reproduce the @xmath2 for a star of a given mass without a magnetic field .",
    "if this happens , it might be a hint to adopt magnetic models .",
    "otherwise , if the @xmath2 is ignored , then masses would typically be overestimated by about 10% .",
    "magnetic models will , however , have an immediate impact on the estimated radii of transiting exoplanets .",
    "the radii of transiting exoplanetary radii scale with the stellar radius .",
    "this is but one reason that further exploration of the role of magnetic fields in low - mass stars is required .",

    "estimates of its x - ray luminosity include contributions from cu cnc , as discussed in section [ sec : cucnc1 ] .",
    "only for cv cnc did we correct for this confusion .",
    "overall , uncertainty in the stellar radius affects the magnetic flux while the lack of spatial resolution affects the x - ray luminosity .",
    "therefore , we believe our estimates are robust , particularly given that figure [ fig : lx_mx_rad ] is plotted using logarithmic units , where a factor of two does not contribute to a significant shift in the data .",
    "the regression line and associated uncertainty limits shown in figure [ fig : lx_mx_rad ] were obtained by performing an ordinary least squares ( ols ) regression .",
    "a standard ols was selected as we are not attempting to establish a causal relationship between @xmath128 and @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "our primary concern is developing a relationship that permits a prediction of @xmath128 given a value for @xmath127 .",
    "following the recommendations of @xcite and @xcite , we perform an ols@xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the predictor variable and @xmath260 is the variable to be predicted .",
    "note that we transformed the variables to a logarithmic scale because the data extends over several orders of magnitude in @xmath128 and @xmath127 .",
    "the result of the ols analysis yielded a regression line @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the mean value of @xmath263 taken over the entire sample .",
    "a shift of the dependent variable was performed prior to the regression analysis . by doing this , we were able to minimize the error associated with the @xmath264-intercept .",
    "however , the standard deviation of the mean , @xmath265 , becomes the largest source of error .",
    "we found @xmath266 , where we took @xmath267 we opted for computing the standard deviation with @xmath268 because of our small sample ( 27 data points ) so as to provide a conservative error estimate ."

    "<S> agreement between model predicted surface magnetic field strengths and those inferred from x - ray observations can be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its energy from convection . </S>",
    "<S> this approach makes the transport of heat by convection less efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in other studies . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of the aforementioned systems are reported . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop an expression relating a reduction in the convective mixing length to a magnetic field strength in units of the equipartition value . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with those from previous investigations to incorporate magnetic fields to explain the low - mass deb radius inflation . </S>",
