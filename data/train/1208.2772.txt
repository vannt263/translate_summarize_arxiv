    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems with a compact star ( neutron star or black - hole ) accreting matter from a low - mass star ( usually k , m dwarf or red giant ) while they revolve around each other .",
    "occasionally most of these systems undergo a large increase in x - ray luminosities ( by a factor more than 1000 ) displaying peak x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "these x - ray outbursts last for a few weeks to months except in some of the lmxbs in which they last up to a few years or rarely a decade as well .",
    "the sources with these long x - ray outbursts ( @xmath2 1 year ) are also known as quasi - persistent lmxbs . during these outbursts ,",
    "the majority of the x - rays are emitted in the inner accretion disk while the optical / infrared ( oir ) light is emitted due to the reprocessed emission in the outer accretion disk and the surface of the companion star . in the quiescence state ,",
    "the oir light dominantly comes from the low - mass companion star and allows us to identify the companion star which is important to constrain the mass of the compact object .    during the last decade",
    ", many faint to very - faint x - ray transients have been discovered with peak x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these sources are discovered  in the galactic plane and a large fraction of them were discovered through the thermonuclear bursts @xcite .",
    "these bursts have so far been observed only from the neutron star lmxbs hence probably these faint transients are also members of lmxbs .",
    "however the current instability models that explain the transient behaviour of lmxbs ( e .. g , @xcite ) can not explain the low peak x - ray luminosities of these faint systems .",
    "it is possible that these sources are accreting from the stellar wind of a companion star @xcite or they have a small accretion disk , which indicate a small orbit that can only accommodate a very small donor star - e.g. , brown dwarfs or white dwarfs - the latter are called ultra - compact x - ray binaries with extremely short orbital periods ( @xmath4 80 minutes ; @xcite ) . to confirm these proposed scenarios ,",
    "there have been efforts to identify the oir counterpart of them ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , however most of the times , high extinction and crowded oir fields in the galactic plane hamper the detection and identification of the real counterpart . in this paper",

    "we note that this magnitude differs by 0.2 mag as compared to the previous reporting of our observations @xcite and we believe this could be related to the calibration of the observations which was done with respect to the 2mass during the previous analysis and ukirt observations in this paper .",

    "however the fact that xmm1747 is lying in a very crowded field in the nir bands , which is also suggested by detection of two stars in the _ chandra _ error circle of the source show that the chance coincidence of detection of a foreground star is very high . also due to the high extinction towards the source",
    ", we can not deny that the real counterpart might not have been detected . from the magellan observations , we measured the limiting magnitude of 20.0 mag in the @xmath44 band .",
    "hence if the real counterpart was indeed not detected during our observations , then the observed @xmath44 band magnitude of the counterpart would be 20.0 mag or fainter , which indicate a star of spectral type later than k -type , which is not unexpected for lmxbs .    for sax1806 , we detected a nir star of magnitude 17.21 mag in @xmath44 band during the x - ray outburst , consistent with its _ chandra _ error circle .",
