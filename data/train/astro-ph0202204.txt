    "in the typical hierarchical clustering scheme of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , sub - galactic clumps are formed from gravitational collapse of small initial density perturbations , and those clumps progressively merge and collapse to become galaxies of larger masses . merging processes increase ( decrease ) the number density of bright ( faint ) galaxies , and enhance the clustering amplitudes of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity functions ( lfs ) and clustering properties of high-@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) galaxies are , thus , essential for understanding the galaxy formation .",
    "recent observational efforts at optical wavelengths have revealed two major classes of high-@xmath21 galaxies which are suitable for studying lfs and clustering properties of distant galaxies .",
    "one class of high-@xmath21 galaxies is lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xcite ) which are selected by their uv - continuum features redshifted to optical wavelengths . galaxies by photometric redshift techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since photometric redshift techniques also use essentially the lyman break feature for selecting them , we refer to , for simplicity , those selected by photometric redshifts as lbgs throughout this paper . ] since lbgs are identified by their strong continuum break , they are generally limited to uv - continuum bright galaxies .",
    "such bright high-@xmath21 galaxies can be well investigated .",
    "the lf of lbgs at @xmath23 @xcite has a larger @xmath24 than that of the local uv - selected galaxies @xcite , but its normalization , @xmath25 , is comparable within a factor of two for the lbgs and for the local galaxies ( see also @xcite ) . the apparent size of lbgs at @xmath23 is @xmath26-@xmath27 ( @xmath28kpc for @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) in a half light radius @xcite .",
    "lbgs at @xmath29 show stronger clustering than the underlying dark matter @xcite .",
    "a hint of mergers has been found for lbgs at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the other class of high - z galaxies is lyman @xmath1 emitters ( laes ) which are identified by their redshifted ly@xmath1 emission with narrow - band imaging @xcite .",
    "laes are thus high-@xmath21 galaxies which have a relatively strong ly@xmath1 emission whose rest - frame equivalent width , @xmath30 , is @xmath31 .",
    "most of the detected laes tend to have fainter continua than lbgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated number density of laes down to @xmath32 is @xmath33deg@xmath34 per unit @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the size of laes at @xmath35 is as small as @xmath36 ( @xmath37kpc for @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) in a half light radius @xcite .",
    "an indication for a large scale structure formed by laes at @xmath35 has been reported by @xcite from a combination of their three blank field surveys , although other blind searches have not found such clumpy distributions @xcite .",
    "searches of laes on targetted fields have found strong clustering of laes around quarars @xcite , radio galaxies @xcite , high redshift clusters @xcite , and overdensities in the lbg distribution @xcite .",
    "since laes are fainter and smaller than lbgs and some laes have strong clustering , it is possible that laes are dominated by sub - galactic clumps which subsequently form massive galaxies . indeed , @xcite have proposed that laes are sub - galactic clumps .",
    "if high-@xmath21 laes are dominated by sub - galactic clumps , the lf of laes is expected to show a steep decline toward the bright end .",
    "the clustering amplitude of laes should be larger than that of lbgs on small scales ( @xmath38kpc or @xmath39 ) where the correlation amplitude is sensitive to the fraction of merging galaxies .    in this paper , we report on luminosity functions and clustering properties of laes at @xmath40 , based on our deep ( @xmath41 ) and wide - field ( @xmath42arcmin@xmath0 ) broad- and narrow - band imaging of the subaru deep field .",

    "we regard an object as a lae when it satisfies the following selection criteria simultaneously ,    @xmath68    the first criterion corresponds to an equivalent width ( @xmath20 ) to be @xmath69  in the observed frame ( @xmath70  in the rest frame at @xmath40 ) .",

    "since the ly@xmath1 continua of high-@xmath21 objects are absorbed by neutral hydrogen of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , @xmath3-band fluxes are expected to be weaker than @xmath4-band fluxes for @xmath40 objects .",
    "figure [ fig : cc ] demonstrates that this criterion efficiently rejects low-@xmath21 emitters but selects @xmath40 galaxies whose igm absorptions are stronger than 0.5 @xmath72 , where @xmath72 is the median opacity of the igm given by @xcite .",
    "the third criterion is placed to reject break objects whose spectra have a spectral trough on the bluer side of the @xmath5-band .",

    "these three criteria collectively select laes at @xmath40 with a low contamination from low-@xmath21 interlopers .",
    "there are a total of 87 objects that meet all the criteria simultaneously down to @xmath63 and @xmath74 , where @xmath74 is the @xmath75 limiting magnitude of the i band .",
    "the color criterion , @xmath76 , can be securely imposed on objects detected over a @xmath77 level in @xmath4 ( @xmath61 ) by using their @xmath3 magnitudes or a @xmath78 upper limit ( @xmath79 ) . among the 87 selected objects ,",
    "62 objects brighter than @xmath61 have a secure @xmath76 limit .",

    "we have estimated photometric contamination and completeness of the lae sample .",

    "we need to take two kinds of incompleteness into account ; one is the incompleteness of @xmath4-band detection , and the other is the incompleteness due to our sample being @xmath5-limited . the latter incompleteness is equivalent to missing small-@xmath20 emitters of faint @xmath4 magnitudes .- dependent incompleteness , our @xmath5-limited sample of laes may miss large-@xmath20 emitters of faint @xmath5 magnitudes , since the limiting magnitude of @xmath5 and @xmath4 for our sample selection is @xmath63 and @xmath74 .",

    "a similarly large fraction of contaminants may be expected for the lf of @xmath103 laes .",

    "prior going to investigate the clustering properties of laes , we examine the spatial homogeneity of our data .",
    "we find that the photometric zero points of our data are accurate within 0.1 mag over the whole field of view , since we find that psf - like objects make a single sharp stellar locus in the two - color ( @xmath120 vs. @xmath121 ) plane .",
    "then we examine possible spatial differences in the source detection efficiency by ( 1 ) examining the number densities of @xmath5-band detected objects in small ( @xmath122 ) areas covering the survey region , ( 2 ) measuring the limiting magnitudes in 2700 small ( @xmath123 ) areas for each of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 images , and ( 3 ) estimating the detection completeness of laes from monte - carlo simulations in the same manner as in @xcite but assuming model lae spectra ( see caption of figure [ fig : cc ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , @xcite calculate the averaged ( luminosity weighted ) stellar age from the combination of the rest - frame uv and the rest - frame optical flux , by taking advantage of their near - infrared data .",
    "since we discuss the averaged feature of laes , we use here @xcite s result . ]",
    "a combination of these two findings suggests that galaxies less luminous in uv continuum are on the average older .",
    "if we assume here that uv - continuum luminosity correlates positively with the stellar mass , the suggestion above implies that less massive galaxies tend to be older , which is qualitatively consistent with a hierarchical merging scenario such as cdm models .",
    "we find a clear clustering signal of the laes at @xmath153 .",
    "the amplitude of angular correlation function ( figure [ fig : acorr ] ) is @xmath13 arcsec@xmath14 , and it is about 40 times larger than that of lbgs at @xmath154 @xcite , @xmath155 arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "however , since the selection function in the direction of redshift of the lae sample is about 20 times narrower than that of lbgs , the clustering amplitude of @xmath40 lae in the real space is found to be comparable to that of @xmath18 lbgs as described below .",
    "the clustering amplitude can be translated into the correlation length using limber equation , given the redshift distribution of the sample . assuming that the redshift distribution of the laes is a tophat shape of @xmath153 , we estimate the correlation length , @xmath156 , of the laes to be @xmath15 mpc .",
    "can be approximated by a triangle ( see figure [ fig : sed_response]a ) .",
    "we calculate the correlation length assuming the redshift distribution to be a triangle whose center and fwhm are @xmath152 and @xmath157 , to obtain a slightly larger value , @xmath158mpc . ]",
    "foreground contaminations to the sample dilute an apparent clustering amplitude of laes .",
    "when the fraction of contaminants is @xmath159 , the apparent @xmath134 value can be reduced by a factor of up to @xmath160 ; the maximum reduction occurs when the contaminants are not at all clustered . in reality , the contaminants in our sample will be a sum of emission - line galaxies at several redshifts , and thus would be clustered very weakly on the sky .",
    "if we assume that @xmath159 is 40% for our lae sample ( see section [ sec : selection_sample ] ) and that contaminants are not clustered , we obtain the contamination - corrected correlation length to be @xmath161mpc .",
    "this is the maximum @xmath156 value permitted .",
    "these raw and contamination - corrected values of @xmath156 are larger than that of @xmath18 lbgs obtained in @xcite ; @xmath162mpc for the raw value and @xmath163mpc for the contamination - corrected value .",
    "the mean uv luminosity of laes in this study is fainter than that of @xmath18 lbgs studied in @xcite , since our lae sample includes galaxies down to @xmath164 mag , which is @xmath165 mag fainter than the faintest galaxy in @xcite s @xcite lbg sample .",
    "@xcite have found in their @xmath23 lbgs that @xmath156 increases with the uv luminosity . if this holds for lbgs at @xmath18 and laes at @xmath40 , our lae sample should give a smaller value of @xmath156 than @xcite s @xcite lbg sample .",
    "however , no such trend is seen ; the @xmath156 of @xmath40 laes is even larger than that of @xmath18 lbgs .",
    "this may imply that @xmath40 laes have a higher biasing factor against the underlying dark matter than @xmath18 lbgs .",
    "( in this discussion , we assume that clustering properties of galaxies do not significantly evolve from @xmath40 to @xmath18 ) .",
    "the general trend that @xmath156 increases with halo mass may not necessarily hold for laes , since their clustering might be enhanced due to , say , unknown evironmental effects which produce galaxies with strong ly@xmath1 emission lines .",
    "however , we can not rule out at present the possibility that the dark halo masses of laes are higher than our expectations from their luminosities .",
    "the laes in our sample have nearly the same dynamic range both in ly@xmath1 luminosity ( @xmath166 ) and in uv - continuum luminosity ( @xmath167 to @xmath168 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : acorr_seg ] shows , however , that the difference of clustering amplitude is seen not for uv sub - samples but only for ly@xmath1 sub - samples . hence the degree of clustering is probably more strongly dependent on ly@xmath1 luminosity than uv - continuum luminosity .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact found above that @xmath40 laes show stronger clustering amplitude than @xmath94 lbgs in spite of the former being fainter in uv - continuum luminosity .",
    "@xcite have found in their @xmath23 lbg sample that older lbgs ( in terms of mean stellar age ) have a stronger ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "if this is also the case for laes , laes with a stronger ly@xmath1 emission will be older on the average .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that laes more luminous in ly@xmath1 emission are more strongly clustered , if we assume that the biasing factor is higher for older galaxies .",
    "we have found that laes dominate at the fainter part of the uv lf of galaxies at @xmath94 .",
    "we have also found a clear clustering signal in our @xmath40 lae sample . @xcite",
    "have made the hypothesis , from their findings of @xmath35 laes being compact , that laes may be sub - galactic clumps located in groups or sheets of collapsed dark matter .",
    "our two findings seem to be consistent with the hypothesis .",
