    "the theory of information has been revolutionized by the discovery that quantum algorithms can run exponentially faster than their classical counterparts , and by the invention of quantum error - correction protocols @xcite .",
    "these fundamental breakthroughs have lead scientists and engineers to imagine building entirely novel types of information processors . however , the construction of a computer exploiting quantum  rather than classical ",
    "principles represents a formidable scientific and technological challenge .",
    "while quantum bits must be strongly inter - coupled by gates to perform quantum computation , they must at the same time be completely decoupled from external influences , except during the write , control and readout phases when information must flow freely in and out of the machine .",
    "this difficulty does not exist for the classical bits of an ordinary computer , which each follow strongly irreversible dynamics that damp the noise of the environment .",
    "most proposals for implementing a quantum computer have been based on qubits constructed from microscopic degrees of freedom : spin of either electrons or nuclei , transition dipoles of either atoms or ions in vacuum .",
    "these degrees of freedom are naturally very well isolated from their environment , and hence decohere very slowly .",
    "the main challenge of these implementations is enhancing the inter - qubit coupling to the level required for fast gate operations without introducing decoherence from parasitic environmental modes and noise . in this review",
    ", we will discuss a radically different experimental approach based on quantum integrated circuits .  here",
    ", qubits are constructed from _ collective _ electrodynamic modes of macroscopic electrical elements , rather than microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that these qubits have intrinsically large electromagnetic cross - sections , which implies they may be easily coupled together in complex topologies via simple linear electrical elements like capacitors , inductors , and transmission lines .",
    "however , strong coupling also presents a related challenge : is it possible to isolate these electrodynamic qubits from ambient parasitic noise while retaining efficient communication channels for the write , control , and read operations ?",
    "the main purpose of this article is to review the considerable progress that has been made in the past few years towards this goal , and to explain how new ideas about methodology and materials are likely to improve coherence to the threshold needed for quantum error correction .      before starting our discussion",
    ", we must warn the reader that this review is atypical in that it is neither historical nor exhaustive .",
    "some important works have not been included or are only partially covered .",
    "we amply cite work by our own , at the risk of irritating the reader , but we wanted to base our speculations on experiments whose details we fully understand .",
    "we have on purpose narrowed our focus : we adopt the point of view of an engineer trying to determine the best strategy for building a reliable machine given certain design criteria .",
    "this approach obviously runs the risk of presenting a biased and even incorrect account of recent scientific results , since the optimization of a complex system is always an intricate process with both hidden passageways and dead - ends .",
    "we hope nevertheless that the following sections will at least stimulate discussions on how to harness the physics of quantum integrated circuits into a mature quantum information processing technology .",
    "for an integrated circuit to behave quantum mechanically , the first requirement is the absence of dissipation . more specifically , all metallic parts need to be made out of a material that has zero resistance at the qubit operating temperature and at the qubit transition frequency .",
    "this is essential in order for electronic signals to be carried from one part of the chip to another without energy loss  a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the preservation of quantum coherence .",
    "low temperature superconductors such as aluminium or niobium are ideal for this task @xcite .",
    "for this reason , quantum integrated circuit implementations have been nicknamed superconducting qubits .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the quantum integrated circuit must be cooled to temperatures where the typical energy @xmath0 of thermal fluctuations is much less that the energy quantum @xmath1 associated with the transition between the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for reasons which will become clear in subsequent sections , this frequency for superconducting qubits is in the 5 - 20 ghz range and therefore",
    ", the operating temperature temperature @xmath4 must be around 20 mk ( recall that 1 k corresponds to about 20 ghz ) .",
    "these temperatures may be readily obtained by cooling the chip with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "perhaps more importantly though , the electromagnetic temperature  of the wires of the control and readout ports connected to the chip must also be cooled to these low temperatures , which requires careful electromagnetic filtering .",
    "note that electromagnetic damping mechanisms are usually stronger at low temperatures than those originating from electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the techniques @xcite and requirements @xcite for ultra - low noise filtering have been known for about 20 years . from the requirements @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy gap of the superconducting material , one must use superconducting materials with a transition temperature greater than about 1k .",
    "quantum signal processing can not be performed using only purely linear components . in quantum circuits",
    ", however , the non - linear elements must obey the additional requirement of being non - dissipative .",
    "elements like pin diodes or cmos transistors are thus forbidden , even if they could be operated at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "there is only one electronic element that is both non - linear and non - dissipative at arbitrarily low temperature : the superconducting tunnel junction ( also known as a josephson tunnel junction @xcite ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1-jjab ] , this circuit element consists of a sandwich of two superconducting thin films separated by an insulating layer that is thin enough ( typically @xmath81 nm ) to allow tunneling of discrete charges through the barrier .  in later sections we will describe how the tunneling of cooper pairs creates an inductive path with strong non - linearity , thus creating energy levels suitable for a qubit .",
    "the tunnel barrier is typically fabricated from oxidation of the superconducting metal .",
    "this results in a reliable barrier since the oxidation process is self - terminating @xcite .",
    "the materials properties of amorphous aluminum oxide , alumina , make it an attractive tunnel insulating layer .  in part because of its well - behaved oxide , aluminum is the material from which good quality tunnel junctions are most easily fabricated , and it is often said that aluminium is to superconducting quantum circuits what silicon is to conventional mosfet circuits . although the josephson effect is a subtle physical effect involving a combination of tunneling and superconductivity , the junction fabrication process is relatively straightforward .",
    "superconducting junctions and wires are fabricated using techniques borrowed from conventional integrated circuits .",
    "quantum circuits are typically made on silicon wafers using optical or electron - beam lithography and thin film deposition .",
    "they present themselves as a set of micron - size or sub - micron - size circuit elements ( tunnel junctions , capacitors , and inductors ) connected by wires or transmission lines .",
    "the size of the chip and elements are such that , to a large extent , the electrodynamics of the circuit can be analyzed using simple transmission line equations or even a lumped element approximation .",
    "contact to the chip is made by wires bonded to mm - size metallic pads .",
    "the circuit can be designed using conventional layout and classical simulation programs .",
    "thus , many of the design concepts and tools of conventional semiconductor electronics can be directly applied to quantum circuits . nevertheless , there are still important differences between conventional and quantum circuits at the conceptual level .      at the conceptual level ,",
    "conventional and quantum circuits differ in that , in the former , the collective electronic degrees of freedom such as currents and voltages are classical variables , whereas in the latter , these degrees of freedom must be treated by quantum operators which do not necessarily commute .",
    "a more concrete way of presenting this rather abstract difference is to say that a typical electrical quantity , such as the charge on the plates of a capacitor , can be thought of as a simple number in conventional circuits , whereas in quantum circuits , the charge on the capacitor must be represented by a wave function giving the probability amplitude of all charge configurations .",
    "for example , the charge on the capacitor can be in a superposition of states where the charge is both positive and negative at the same time .",
    "similarly the current in a loop might be flowing in two opposite directions at the same time .",
    "these situations have originally been nicknamed macroscopic quantum coherenceeffects by tony leggett @xcite to emphasize that quantum integrated circuits are displaying phenomena involving the collective behavior of many particles , which are in contrast to the usual quantum effects associated with microscopic particles such as electrons , nuclei or molecules .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly mentioning how quantum integrated circuits satisfy the so - called divicenzo criteria for the implementation of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the non - linearity of tunnel junctions is the key property ensuring that non - equidistant level subsystems can be implemented ( criterion # 1 : qubit existence ) . as in many other implementations ,",
    "initialization is made possible ( criterion # 2 : qubit reset ) by the use of low temperature .",
    "absence of dissipation in superconductors is one of the key factors in the quantum coherence of the system ( criterion # 3 : qubit coherence ) .",
    "finally , gate operation and readout ( criteria # 4 and # 5 ) are easily implemented here since electrical signals confined to and traveling along wires constitute very efficient coupling methods .",
    "we consider first the simplest example of a quantum integrated circuit , the lc  oscillator .",
    "this circuit is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2-lc ] , and consists of an inductor @xmath9 connected to a capacitor @xmath10 , all metallic parts being superconducting .",
    "this simple circuit is the lumped - element version of a superconducting cavity or a transmission line resonator ( for instance , the link between cavity resonators and @xmath11 circuits is elegantly discussed by feynman @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion of the @xmath11 circuit are those of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is convenient to take the position coordinate as being the flux @xmath12 in the inductor , while the role of conjugate momentum is played by the charge @xmath13 on the capacitor playing the role of its conjugate momentum .",
    "the variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 have to be treated as canonically conjugate quantum operators that obey @xmath14 = i\\hbar $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the circuit is @xmath15 , which can be equivalently written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number operator for photons in the resonator and @xmath18 is the resonance frequency of the oscillator .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters of the circuit hamiltonian are not fundamental constants of nature .",
    "they are engineered quantities with a large range of possible values which can be modified easily by changing the dimensions of elements , a standard lithography operation .",
    "it is in this sense , in our opinion , that the system is unambiguously macroscopic .",
    "the other important combination of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the characteristic impedance @xmath19 of the circuit .",
    "when we combine this impedance with the residual resistance of the circuit and/or its radiation losses , both of which we can lump into a resistance @xmath20 , we obtain the quality factor of the oscillation : @xmath21 .",
    "the theory of the harmonic oscillator shows that a quantum superposition of ground state and first excited state decays on a time scale given by @xmath22 .",
    "this last equality illustrates the general link between a classical measure of dissipation and the upper limit of the quantum coherence time .      in practice",
    ", the circuit shown in fig .  [ fig : fig2-lc ] may be fabricated using planar components with lateral dimensions around 10 @xmath23 m , giving values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 approximately @xmath24 nh and @xmath25 pf , respectively , and yielding @xmath26ghz and @xmath27 .",
    "if we use aluminium , a good bcs superconductor with transition temperature of 1.1 k and a gap @xmath28 200 @xmath29 , dissipation from the breaking of cooper pairs will begin at frequencies greater than @xmath30ghz .  the residual resistivity of a bcs superconductor decreases exponentially with the inverse of temperature and linearly with frequency , as shown by the mattis - bardeen ( mb)formula @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the resistivity of the metal in the normal state ( we are treating here the case of the so - called dirtysuperconductor @xcite , which is well adapted to thin film systems ) . according to mb , the intrinsic losses of the superconductor at the temperature and frequency ( typically 20 mk and 20 ghz ) associated with qubit dynamics can be safely neglected .",
    "however , we must warn the reader that the intrisinsic losses in the superconducting material do not exhaust , by far , sources of dissipation , even if very high quality factors have been demonstrated in superconducting cavity experiments @xcite .",
    "although the intrisinsic dissipation of superconducting circuits can be made very small , losses are in general governed by the coupling of the circuit with the electromagnetic environment that is present in the forms of write , control and readout lines . these lines ( which we also refer to as ports ) have a characteristic propagation impedance @xmath33 , which is constrained to be a fraction of the impedance of the vacuum @xmath34 .",
    "it is thus easy to see that our @xmath11 circuit , with a characteristic impedance of @xmath35 , tends to be rather well impedance - matched to any pair of leads .",
    "this circumstance occurs very frequently in circuits , and almost never in microscopic systems such as atoms which interact very weakly with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we live in a universe where the ratio @xmath36 , also known as the fine structure constant 1/137.0 , is a small number . ] .",
    "matching to @xmath37 is a useful feature because it allows strong coupling for writing , reading , and logic operations . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", the challenge with quantum circuits is to isolate them from parasitic degrees of freedom . *",
    "the major task of this review is to explain how this has been achieved so far and what level of isolation is attainable .",
    "*      while our example shows that quantum circuits can be mass - produced by standard microfabrication techniques and that their parameters can be easily engineered to reach some optimal condition , it also points out evident drawbacks of being macroscopic  for qubits .",
    "the engineered quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be written as    @xmath38    * the first term on the right - handside denotes the static part of the parameter .",
    "it has * statistical variations * : unlike atoms whose transition frequencies in isolation are so reproducible that they are the basis of atomic clocks , circuits will always be subject to parameter variations from one fabrication batch to another . thus prior to any operation",
    "using the circuit , the transition frequencies and coupling strength will have to be determined by diagnostic  sequences and then taken into account in the algorithms . *",
    "the second term on the right - handside denotes the time - dependent fluctuations of the parameter .",
    "it describes * noise * due to residual material defects moving in the material of the substrate or in the material of the circuit elements themselves .",
    "this noise can affect for instance the dielectric constant of a capacitor .",
    "the low frequency components of the noise will make the resonance frequency wobble and contribute to the dephasing of the oscillation .",
    "furthermore , the frequency component of the noise at the transition frequency of the resonator will induce transitions between states and will therefore contribute to the energy relaxation .",
    "let us stress that statistical variations and noise are not problems affecting superconducting qubit parameters only .",
    "for instance when several atoms or ions are put together in microcavities for gate operation , patch potential effects will lead to expressions similar in form to eq .",
    "( [ fluctuat - lc ] ) for the parameters of the hamiltonian , even if the isolated single qubit parameters are fluctuation - free .",
    "not all aspects of quantum information processing using quantum integrated circuits can be discussed within the framework of the lc circuit , however .",
    "it lacks an important ingredient : non - linearity . in the harmonic oscillator",
    ", all transitions between neighbouring states are degenerate as a result of the parabolic shape of the potential . in order to have a qubit , the transition frequency between states @xmath39 and @xmath40 must be sufficiently different from the transition between higher - lying eigenstates , in particular 1 and 2 .",
    "indeed , the maximum number of 1-qubit operations that can be performed coherently scales as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the quality factor of the @xmath43 transition .",
    "josephson tunnel junctions are crucial for quantum circuits since they bring a strongly non - parabolic inductive potential energy .",
    "at low temperatures , and at the low voltages and low frequencies corresponding to quantum information manipulation , the josephson tunnel junction behaves as a pure non - linear inductance ( josephson element ) in parallel with the capacitance corresponding to the parallel plate capacitor formed by the two overlapping films of the junction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1-jjab]b ) .",
    "this minimal , yet precise model , allows arbitrary complex quantum circuits to be analysed by a quantum version of conventional circuit theory . even though the tunnel barrier is a layer of order ten atoms thick",
    ", the value of the josephson non - linear inductance is very robust against static disorder , just like an ordinary inductance  such as the one considered in section 3  is very insensitive to the position of each atom in the wire .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point .",
    "let us recall that a linear inductor , like any electrical element , can be fully characterized by its constitutive equation . introducing a generalization of the ordinary magnetic flux , which is only defined for a loop",
    ", we define the * branch flux of an electric element * by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the space integral of the electric field along a current line inside the element . in this language ,",
    "the current @xmath46 flowing through the inductor is proportional to its branch flux @xmath47 :    @xmath48    note that the generalized flux @xmath47 can be defined for any electric element with two leads ( dipole element ) , and in particular for the josephson junction , even though it does not resemble a coil .",
    "the josephson element behaves inductively , as its branch flux - current relationship @xcite is :    @xmath49 \\label{nl - inductor}\\ ] ]    this inductive behavior is the manifestation , at the level of collective electrical variables , of the inertia of cooper pairs tunneling across the insulator ( kinetic inductance ) .",
    "the discreteness of cooper pair tunneling causes the periodic flux dependence of the current , with a period given by a universal quantum constant @xmath50 , the superconducting flux quantum @xmath51 .",
    "the junction parameter @xmath52 is called the critical current of the tunnel element .",
    "it scales proportionally to the area of the tunnel layer and diminishes exponentially with the tunnel layer thickness .",
    "note that the constitutive relation eq .",
    "( [ nl - inductor ] ) expresses in only one equation the two josephson relations @xcite .",
    "this compact formulation is made possible by the introduction of the branch flux ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3-iphi ] ) .",
    "the purely sinusoidal form of the constitutive relation eq .",
    "( [ nl - inductor ] ) can be traced to the perturbative nature of cooper pair tunneling in a tunnel junction .",
    "higher harmonics can appear if the tunnel layer becomes very thin , though their presence would not fundamentally change the discussion presented in this review .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 is called the gauge - invariant phase difference accross the junction ( often abridged into phase ) .",
    "it is important to realize that at the level of the constitutive relation of the josephson element , this variable is nothing else than an electromagnetic flux in dimensionless units . in general",
    ", we have    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the phase difference between the two superconducting condensates on both sides of the junction .",
    "this last relation expresses how the superconducting ground state and electromagnetism are tied together .",
    "the josephson element is also often described by two other parameters , each of which carry exactly the same information as the critical current .",
    "the first one is the josephson effective inductance @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the reduced flux quantum .",
    "the name of this other form becomes obvious if we expand the sine function in eq .",
    "( [ nl - inductor ] ) in powers of @xmath12 around @xmath58 .",
    "keeping the leading term , we have @xmath59 .",
    "note that the junction behaves for small signals almost as a point - like kinetic inductance : a 100nm@xmath60100 nm area junction will have a typical inductance of 100nh , whereas the same inductance is only obtained magnetically with a loop of about 1 cm in diameter . more generally , it is convenient to define the phase - dependent josephson inductance    @xmath61    note that the josephson inductance not only depends on @xmath62 , it can actually become infinite or negative !",
    "thus , under the proper conditions , the josephson element can become a switch and even an active circuit element , as we will see below .",
    "the other useful parameter is the josephson energy @xmath63 .",
    "if we compute the energy stored in the junction @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "in contrast with the parabolic dependence on flux of the energy of an inductance , the potential associated with a josephson element has the shape of a cosine washboard .",
    "the total height of the corrugation of the washboard is @xmath66 .",
    "a direct application of the non - linear inductance of the josephson element is obtained by splitting a junction and its leads into 2 equal junctions , such that the resulting loop has an inductance much smaller the josephson inductance .",
    "the two smaller junctions in parallel then behave as an effective junction @xcite whose josephson energy varies with @xmath67 , the magnetic flux externally imposed through the loop : @xmath68 here , @xmath69 the total josephson energy of the two junctions .",
    "the josephson energy can also be modulated by applying a magnetic field in the plane parallel to the tunnel layer .",
    "if we leave the leads of a josephson junction unconnected , we obtain the simplest example of a non - linear electrical resonator . in order to analyze its quantum dynamics",
    ", we apply the prescriptions of quantum circuit theory briefly summarized in appendix  [ app : quantumcircuittheory ] . choosing a representation privileging the branch variables of the josephson element",
    ", the momentum corresponds to the charge @xmath70 having tunneled through the element and the canonically conjugate position is the flux @xmath71 associated with the superconducting phase difference across the tunnel layer . here ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are treated as operators that obey @xmath74 = i$ ] .",
    "it is important to note that the operator @xmath72 has integer eigenvalues whereas the phase @xmath55 is an operator corresponding to the position of a point on the unit circle ( an angle modulo @xmath75 ) .    by eliminating the branch charge of the capacitor ,",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the coulomb charging energy corresponding to one cooper pair on the junction capacitance @xmath78 and where @xmath79 is the residual offset charge on the capacitor .",
    "one may wonder how the constant @xmath79 got into the hamiltonian , since no such term appeared in the corresponding @xmath11 circuit in section 3 .",
    "the continuous charge @xmath79 is equal to the charge that pre - existed on the capacitor when it was wired with the inductor .",
    "such offset charge is not some nit - picking theoretical construct .",
    "its physical origin is a slight difference in work function between the two electrodes of the capacitor and/or an excess of charged impurities in the vicinity of one of the capacitor plates relative to the other .",
    "the value of @xmath79 is in practice very large compared to the cooper pair charge @xmath80 , and since the hamiltonian  ( [ single - junction ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath81 , its value can be considered completely random .    such residual offset charge also exists in the lc circuit",
    ". however , we did not include it in our description of section 3 since a time - independent @xmath79 does not appear in the dynamical behavior of the circuit : it can be removed from the hamiltonian by performing a trivial canonical transformation leaving the form of the hamiltonian unchanged .",
    "it is not possible , however , to iron this constant out of the junction hamiltonian  ( [ single - junction ] ) because the potential is not quadratic in @xmath73 .",
    "the parameter @xmath79 plays a role here similar to the vector potential appearing in the hamiltonian of an electron in a magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ single - junction ] ) thus depends thus on three parameters which , following our discussion of the @xmath11 oscillator , we write as    @xmath82    in order to distinguish the static variation resulting from fabrication of the circuit from the time - dependent fluctuations .",
    "while @xmath83 can be considered fully random ( see above discussion ) , @xmath84 and @xmath85 can generally be adjusted by construction to a precision better than 20% .",
    "the relative fluctuations @xmath86 and @xmath87 are found to have a @xmath88 power spectral density with a typical standard deviations at 1 hz roughly of order 10@xmath89 hz@xmath90 and 10@xmath91 hz@xmath90 , respectively , for a junction with a typical area of 0.01 @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the noise appears to be produced by independent two - level fluctuators @xcite .",
    "the relative fluctuations @xmath93 are much less known , but the behavior of some glassy insulators at low temperatures might lead us to expect also a @xmath88 power spectral density , but probably with a weaker intensity than those of @xmath87 .",
    "we refer to the 3 noise terms in eq .",
    "( [ intrinsic - noises ] ) as offset charge , dielectric and critical current noises , respectively .",
    "the first - order problem in realizing a josephson qubit is to suppress as much as possible the detrimental effect of the fluctuations of @xmath79 , while retaining the non - linearity of the circuit .",
    "there are three main stategies for solving this problem and they lead to three fundamental basic type of qubits involving only one josephson element .      the simplest circuit is called the cooper pair box  and was first described theoretically , albeit in a slightly different version than presented here , by m. bttiker @xcite .",
    "it was first realized experimentally by the saclay group in 1997 @xcite .",
    "quantum dynamics in the time domain were first seen by the nec  group in 1999 @xcite .    in the cooper pair box ,",
    "the deviations of the residual offset charge @xmath79 are compensated by biasing the josephson tunnel junction with a voltage source @xmath94 in series with a gate  capacitor @xmath95 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 - 3qbts]a ) .",
    "one can easily show that the hamiltonian of the cooper pair box is @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the charging energy of the island of the box and @xmath98 .",
    "note that this hamiltonian has the same form as hamiltonian  ( [ single - junction ] ) .",
    "often @xmath99 is simply written as @xmath100 since @xmath94 at the chip level will anyway deviate substantially from the generator value at high - temperature due to stray emf s in the low - temperature cryogenic wiring .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig6 - 2energies - vs - ng ] we plot the first few eigenenergies as a function of @xmath99 for @xmath103 and @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the cooper box is to quantum circuit physics what the hydrogen atom is to atomic physics .",
    "we can modify the spectrum with the action of two externally controllable electrodynamic parameters : @xmath99 , which is directly proportional to @xmath94 , and @xmath69 , which can be varied by applying a field through the junction or by using a split junction and applying a flux through the loop , as discussed in section 3 .",

    "it is often important to realize that even if the control parameter has a very stable value at the level of room - temperature electronics , the noise in the electrical components relaying its value at the qubit level might be inducing detrimental fluctuations .",
    "an example is the flux through a superconducting loop , which in principle could be set very precisely by a stable current in a coil , and which in practice often fluctuates because of trapped flux motion in the wire of the loop or in nearby superconducting films .",

    "the three basic quantum circuit types discussed above illustrate a general tendency of josephson qubits . if we try to make the level structure very non - linear , i.e. @xmath180 , we necessarily expose the system sensitively to at least one type of intrinsic noise .",
    "the flux qubit is contructed to reach a very large non - linearity , but is also maximally exposed , relatively speaking , to critical current noise and flux noise . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase qubit starts with a relatively small non - linearity and acquires it at the expense of a precise tuning of the difference between the bias current and the critical current , and therefore exposes itself also to the noise in the latter .",
    "the cooper pair box , finally , acquires non - linearity at the expense of its sensitivity to offset charge noise .",
    "the search for the optimal qubit circuit involves therefore a detailed knowledge of the relative intensities of the various sources of noise , and their variations with all the construction parameters of the qubit , and in particular  this point is crucial  the properties of the materials involved in the tunnel junction fabrication .",

    "the qubit optimization problem is also further complicated by the necessity to readout quantum information , which we address just after reviewing the relationships between the intensity of noise and the decay rates of quantum information .",
    "a generic quantum state of a qubit can be represented as a unit vector @xmath181 pointing on a sphere  the so - called bloch sphere .",
    "one distinguishes two broad classes of errors .",
    "the first one corresponds to the tip of the bloch vector diffusing in the latitude direction , i.e. along the arc joining the two poles of the sphere to or away from the north pole . this process is called energy relaxation or state - mixing",
    ". the second class corresponds to the tip of the bloch vector diffusing in the longitude direction , i.e. perpendicularly to the line joining the two poles .",

    "we define precisely the relaxation and decoherence rates and show that they are directly proportional to the power spectral densities of the noises entering in the parameters of the hamiltonian of the qubit .",
    "more precisely , we find that the decoherence rate is proportional to the total spectral density of the quasi - zero - frequency noise in the qubit larmor frequency .",
    "the relaxation rate , on the other hand , is proportional to the total spectral density , at the qubit larmor frequency , of the noise in the field perpendicular to the eigenaxis of the qubit .    in principle , the expressions for the relaxation and decoherence rate could lead to a ranking of the various qubit circuits : from their reduced spin hamiltonian , one can find with what coefficient each basic noise source contributes to the various spectral densities entering in the rates .",
    "in the same manner , one could optimize the various qubit parameters to make them insensitive to noise , as much as possible .",
    "however , before discussing this question further , we must realize that the readout itself can provide substantial additional noise sources for the qubit .",
    "therefore , the design of a qubit circuit that maximizes the number of coherent gate operations is a subtle optimization problem which must treat in parallel both the intrinsic noises of the qubit and the back - action noise of the readout .",
    "we have examined so far the various basic circuits for qubit implementation and their associated methods to write and manipulate quantum information .",
    "another important task quantum circuits must perform is the readout of that information . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "the difficulty of the readout problem is to open a coupling channel to the qubit for extracting information without at the same time submitting it to noise .",
    "ideally , the readout part of the circuit  referred to in the following simply as readout should include both a switch , which defines an off  and an on  phase , and a state measurement device . during the off phase , where reset and gate operations take place , the measurement device should be completely decoupled from the qubit degrees of freedom . during the on phase ,",
    "the measurement device should be maximally coupled to a qubit variable that distinguishes the 0 and the 1 state . however , this condition is not sufficient .",
    "the back - action of the measurement device during the on phase should be weak enough not to relax the qubit @xcite .",
    "the readout can be characterized by 4 parameters .",
    "the first one describes the sensitivity of the measuring device while the next two describe its back - action , factoring in the quality of the switch :    * the measurement time @xmath182 defined as the time taken by the measuring device to reach a signal - to - noise ratio of 1 in the determination of the state . * the energy relaxation rate @xmath183 of the qubit in the on state .",

    "an important quantity to optimize is the readout fidelity . by construction , at the end of the on phase , the readout should have reached one of two classical states : 0@xmath186 and 1@xmath186 , the outcomes of the measurement process .",
    "the latter can be described by 2 probabilities : the probability @xmath187(@xmath188 ) that starting from the qubit state @xmath189 ( @xmath165 ) the measurement yields 0@xmath186(1@xmath186 ) . the readout fidelity ( or discriminating power )",

    "the fidelity and speed of the readout , usually not discussed in the context of quantum algorithms because they enter marginally in the evaluation of their complexity , are actually key to experiments studying the coherence properties of qubits and gates .",
    "a very fast and sensitive readout will gather at a rapid pace information on the imperfections and drifts of qubit parameters , thereby allowing the experimenter to design fabrication strategies to fight them during the construction or even correct them in real time .",
    "we are thus mostly interested in single - shot  readouts @xcite , for which @xmath193 is of order unity , as opposed to schemes in which a weak measurement is performed continuously @xcite . if @xmath194 , of order @xmath195 identical preparation and readout cycles need to be performed to access the state of the qubit .",
    "the condition for single - shotoperation is    @xmath196    the speed of the readout , determined both by @xmath182 and @xmath185 , should be sufficiently fast to allow a complete characterization of all the properties of the qubit before any drift in parameters occurs . with sufficient speed , the automatic correction of these drits in real time using feedback will be possible .    rapidly pulsing the readout on and off with a large decoupling amplitude such that    @xmath197    requires a fast , strongly non - linear element , which is provided by one or more auxiliary josephson junctions .",
    "decoupling the qubit from the readout in the off phase requires balancing the circuit in the manner of a wheatstone bridge , with the readout input variable and the qubit variable corresponding to 2 orthogonal electrical degrees of freedom . finally , to be as complete as possible even in presence of small asymmetries",
    ", the decoupling also requires an impedance mismatch between the qubit and the dissipative degrees of freedom of the readout . in the next subsection ,",
    "we discuss how these general ideas have been implemented in 2nd generation quantum circuits .",
    "the first three examples we have chosen involve a readout circuit which is built - in the qubit itself to provide maximal coupling during the on phase , as well as a decoupling scheme which has proven effective for obtaining long decoherence times .",
    "the last example incorporates a novel dispersive readout .",

    "the levels in the cubic potential are metastable and decay in the continuum , with level @xmath198 having roughly a decay rate @xmath199 500 times faster than the decay @xmath200 of level @xmath17 .",
    "this strong level number dependence of the decay rate leads naturally to the following readout scheme : when readout needs to be performed , a microwave pulse at the transition frequency @xmath201 ( or better at @xmath202 transfers the eventual population of level @xmath25 into level @xmath203 , the latter decaying rapidly into the continuum , where it subsequently loses energy by friction and falls into the bottom state of the next corrugation of the potential ( because the qubit junction is actually in a superconducting loop of large but finite inductance , the bottom of this next corrugation is in fact the absolute minimum of the potential and the particle representing the system can stay an infinitely long time there ) . thus ,",
    "at the end of the readout pulse , the sytem has either decayed out of the cubic well ( readout state 1@xmath186 ) if the qubit was in the @xmath165 state or remained in the cubic well ( readout state 0@xmath186 ) if the qubit was in the @xmath189 state .",
    "the dc - squid amplifier is sensitive enough to detect the change in flux accompanying the exit of the cubic well , but the problem is to avoid sending the back - action noise of its stabilizing resistor into the qubit circuit .",
    "the solution to this problem involves balancing the squid loop in such a way , that for readout state 0@xmath186 , the small signal gain of the squid is zero , whereas for readout state 1@xmath186 , the small signal gain is non - zero @xcite .",
    "this signal dependent gain is obtained by having 2 junctions in one arm of the squid whose total josephson inductance equals that of the unique junction in the other arm .",

    "it is worthwhile to ask at this point if we could improve the material properties to improve the coherence of the qubit , assuming all other problems like noise in the control channels and the back - action of the readout have been solved . a model put forward by one of us ( jmm ) and collaborators shed some light on the direction one would follow to answer this question .",
    "the @xmath88 spectrum of the materials noises suggests that they all originate from 2-level fluctuators in the amorphous alumina tunnel layer of the junction itself , or its close vicinity .",
    "the substrate or the surface of the superconducting films are also suspect in the case of @xmath117 and @xmath209 but their influence would be relatively weaker and we ignore them for simplicity .",
    "these two - level systems are supposed to be randomly distributed positional degrees of freedom @xmath211 with effective spin-1/2 properties , for instance an impurity atom tunneling between two adjacent potential wells .",
    "each two - level system is in principle characterized by 3 parameters : the energy splitting @xmath212 , and the two coefficients @xmath213 and @xmath214 of the pauli matrix representation of @xmath215 ( @xmath216 here is by definition the energy eigenbasis ) .",
    "the random nature of the problem leads us to suppose that @xmath213 and @xmath214 are both gaussian random variables with the same standard deviation @xmath217 . by carrying a charge",
    ", the thermal and quantum motion of @xmath211 can contribute to @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "likewise , by modifying the transmission of a tunneling channel in its vicinity , the motion of @xmath211 can contribute to @xmath220 .",
    "we can further suppose that the quality of the material of the junction is simply characterized by a few numbers .",
    "the essential one is the density @xmath221 of the transition frequencies @xmath222 in frequency space and in real space , assuming a @xmath223 distribution ( this is necessary to explain the @xmath88 behavior ) and a uniform spatial distribution on the surface of the junction .",
    "recent experiments indicate that the parameter @xmath221 is of order @xmath224 .",
    "then , assuming a universal value for @xmath225 which is independent of frequency , only one coefficient is needed per noise , namely , the average modulation efficiency of each fluctuator .",
    "such analysis provides a common language for describing various experiments probing the dependence of decoherence on the material of the junction .",
    "once the influence of the junction fabrication parameters ( oxidation pressure and temperature , impurity contents , and so on ) on these noise intensities will be known , it will be possible to devise optimized fabrication procedures , in the same way perhaps as the @xmath88 noise in c - mos transistors has been reduced by careful material studies .",
    "the logical thread through this review of superconducting qubits has been the question what is the best qubit design ? .",
    "because some crucial experimental data is still missing , we unfortunately , at present , can not conclude by giving a definitive answer to this complex optimization problem .    yet , a lot has already been achieved , and superconducting qubits are becoming serious competitors of trapped ions and atoms .",
    "the following properties of quantum circuits have been demonstrated :    * coherence quality factors @xmath226 can attain at least 2@xmath227 * readout and reset fidelity can be greater than 95% .",
    "* all states on the bloch sphere can be addressed . *",
    "spin echo techniques can null out low frequency drift of offset charges . *",
    "two qubits can be coupled and rf pulses can implement gate operation . *",
    "a qubit can be fabricated using only optical lithography techniques .",
    "the major problem we are facing is that these various results have not been obtained at the same time in the same circuit , although succesful design elements in one have often been incorporated into the next generation of others .",
    "the complete optimization of the single qubit plus readout has not been achieved yet .",
    "however , we have presented in this review the elements of a systematic methodology resolving the various conflicts that are generated by all the different requirements .",
    "our opinion is that , once noise sources are better characterized , an appropriate combination of all the known circuit design strategies for improving coherence , as well as the understanding of optimal tunnel layer growth conditions for lowering the intrinsic noise of josephson junctions , should lead us to reach the 1-qubit and 2-qubit coherence levels needed for error correction @xcite . along the way , good medium term targets to test overall progress on the simultaneous fronts of qubit coherence , readout and gate coupling are the measurement of bell s inequality violation or the implementation of the deutsch - josza algorithm , both of which requiring the simultaneous satisfaction of properties a)-e ) .",

    "the problem we are addressing in this section is , given a superconducting circuit made up of capacitors , inductors and josephson junctions , how to systematically write its quantum hamiltonian , the generating function from which the quantum dynamics of the circuit can be obtained .",
    "this problem has been considered first by yurke and denker@xcite in a seminal paper and analyzed in further details by devoret@xcite .",
    "we will only summarize here the results needed for this review .",
    "the circuit is given as a set of branches , which can be capacitors , inductors or josephson tunnel elements , connected at nodes .",
    "several independent paths formed by a succession of branches can be found between nodes .",
    "the circuit can therefore contain one or several loops .",
    "it is important to note that a circuit has not one hamiltonian but many , each one depending on a particular representation .",
    "we are describing here one particular type of representation , which is usually well adapted to circuits containing josephson junctions . like in classical circuit theory ,",
    "a set of independent current and voltages has to be found for a particular representation .",
    "we start by associating to each branch @xmath228 of the circuit , the current @xmath229 flowing through it and the voltage @xmath230 across it ( a convention has to be made first on the direction of the branches ) .",
    "kirchhoff s laws impose relations among branch variables and some of them are redundant .",
    "the following procedure is used to eliminate redundant branches : one node of the circuit is first chosen as ground . then from the ground , a loop - free set of branches called spanning tree is selected .",
    "the rule behind the selection of the spanning tree is the following : each node of the circuit must be linked to the ground by one and only one path belonging to the tree . in general , inductors ( linear or non - linear ) are preferred as branches of the tree but this is not necessary . once the spanning tree is chosen ( note that we still have many possibilities for this tree ) , we can associate to each node a node voltage  @xmath231 which is the algebraic sum of the voltages along the branches between ground and the node .",
    "the conjugate node current@xmath232 is the algebraic sum of all currents flowing to the node through capacitors only .",
    "the dynamical variables appearing in the hamiltonian of the circuit are the node fluxes and node charges defined as    @xmath233    using kirchhoff s laws , it is possible to express the flux and the charge of each branch as a linear combination of all the node fluxes and charges , respectively . in this inversion procedure ,",
    "the total flux through loops imposed by external flux bias sources and polarisation charges of nodes imposed by charge bias sources , appear .",
    "if we now sum the energies of all branches of the circuit expressed in terms of node flux and charges , we will obtain the hamiltonian of the circuit corresponding to the representation associated with the particular spanning tree . in this hamiltonian ,",
    "capacitor energies behave like kinetic terms while the inductor energies behave as potential terms .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath11 circuit written in section 2 is an elementary example of this procedure .",
    "once the hamiltonian is obtained it is easy get its quantum version by replacing all the node fluxes and charges by their quantum operator equivalent .",
    "the flux and charge of a node have a commutator given by @xmath234 , like the position and momentum of a particle :    @xmath235 & = & i\\hbar\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can also show that the flux and charge operators corresponding to a branch share the same commutation relation .",
    "note that for the special case of the josephson element , the phase @xmath236 and cooper pair number @xmath237 , which are its dimensionless electric variables , have the property :    @xmath238 = i\\ ] ]    in the so - called charge basis , we have    @xmath239    while in the so - called phase basis , we have    @xmath240    note that since the cooper pair number @xmath237 is an operator with integer eigenvalues , its conjugate variable @xmath236 , has eigenvalues behaving like angles , i.e. they are defined only modulo @xmath75 .    in this review , outside this appendix , we have dropped the hat on operators for simplicity .",
    "from appendix  [ app : quantumcircuittheory ] , it easy to see that the hamiltonian of the cooper pair box leads to the schrodinger equation    @xmath241 \\psi _ { k}\\left ( \\theta \\right ) = e_{k}\\psi _ { k}\\left ( \\theta \\right)\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath242 and energies @xmath243 are solutions of the mathieu equation and can be found with arbitrary precision for all values of the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath244@xcite .",
    "for instance , using the program mathematica , we find    @xmath245 \\\\ \\psi _ { k}\\left ( \\theta \\right ) & = & \\frac{e^{in_{g}\\theta } } { \\sqrt{2\\pi } } \\left\\ { \\mathcal{m}_{c}\\left [ \\frac{4e_{k}}{e_{c}},\\frac{-2e_{j}}{e_{c } } , \\frac{\\theta } { 2}\\right ] + i(-1)^{k+1}\\mathcal{m}_{s}\\left [ \\frac{4e_{k } } { e_{c}},\\frac{-2e_{j}}{e_{c}},\\frac{\\theta } { 2}\\right ] \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath246`[r , q ] , `    @xmath247`[a , q , z ] , `    @xmath248`[a , q , z ] . `",
    "we start by introducing the spin eigenreference frame @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 consisting of the unit vector along the eigenaxis and the associated orthogonal unit vectors ( @xmath250 is in the @xmath252 plane ) .",
    "for instance , for the cooper pair box , we find that @xmath253 , with @xmath254 , while @xmath255 .",
    "note that these rates have both a useful and rigorous meaning only if the evolution of the components of the average bloch vector follows , after a negligibly short settling time , an exponential decay .",
    "the @xmath262 and @xmath263 rates are related to the nmr spin relaxation times @xmath264 and @xmath265 @xcite by      the @xmath265 time can be seen as the net decay time of quantum information , including the influence of both relaxation and dephasing processes . in our discussion of superconducting qubits",
    ", we must separate the contribution of the two types of processes since their physical origin is in general very different and can not rely on the @xmath265 time alone .",
    "the relaxation process can be seen as resulting from unwanted transitions between the two eigenstate of the qubit induced by fluctuations in the effective fields along the @xmath267 and @xmath268 axes . introducing the power spectral density of this field",
    ", one can demonstrate from fermi s golden rule that , for perturbative fluctuations ,              since the fluctuations @xmath273 can be related to the impedance of the environment of the box@xcite , an order of magnitude estimate of the relaxation rate can be performed , and is in rough agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the decoherence process , on the other hand , is induced by fluctuations in the effective field along the eigenaxis @xmath216 .",
    "if these fluctuations are gaussian , with a white noise spectral density up to frequencies of order several @xmath274 ( which is often not the case because of the presence of 1/f noise ) we have      in presence of a low frequency noise with an 1/f behavior , the formula is more complicated@xcite .",
    "if the environment producing the low frequency noise consists of many degrees of freedom , each of which is very weakly coupled to the qubit , then one is in presence of classical dephasing which , if slow enough , can in principle be fought using echo techniques .",
    "if , on the other hand , only a few degrees of freedom like magnetic spins or glassy two - level systems are dominating the low frequency dynamics , dephasing is quantum and not correctable , unless the transition frequencies of these few perturbing degrees of freedom is itself very stable .",
