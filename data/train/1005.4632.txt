    "we introduce a very simple effective theory in which the standard model is supplemented by a spontaneously broken @xmath4 gauge symmetry , the massive gauge boson of which acts as a portal to the standard model ( sm ) by coupling to the top quark .",
    "this type of setup arises naturally in models of  partial compositeness \" in which the top quark acquires its large mass ( after electro - weak symmetry breaking ) through large mixing with composite states in a new strong sector , as in 4d duals to randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian contains @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a dirac fermion which is a singlet under the sm gauge interactions but is charged under @xmath4 and turns out to play the role of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the usual abelian field strength for the @xmath9 ( hyper - charge boson ) , @xmath10 is the @xmath9 coupling to right - handed top quarks , and @xmath11 is the coupling to right - handed wimps .",
    "@xmath12 is the wimp mass .",
    "one can easily include a coupling to the left - handed top ( and bottom ) .",
    "our choice to ignore such a coupling fits well with typical rs models @xcite , balancing the need for a large top yukawa interaction with control over corrections to precision electro - weak observables .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 encapsulates the strength of kinetic mixing between the @xmath2 and sm hyper - charge bosons .",
    "we have included hyper - charge-@xmath9 kinetic mixing through the term proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "such a term is consistent with the gauge symmetries , and even if absent in the uv , will be generated in the ir description by loops of top quarks can be engineered to vanish in the uv , for example , by embedding @xmath4 into a larger gauge group which breaks down at scales of order @xmath14 . ] .",
    "the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath13 generates an effective coupling of sm states to the @xmath9 , and through electro - weak symmetry breaking , mass mixing of the @xmath9 with the sm @xmath15 gauge boson resulting in a coupling of @xmath6 to the sm @xmath15 boson .    in this approach ,",
    "most of the standard model is fundamental , but with the wimp , higgs , and right - handed top largely composite .",
    "the higgs couples strongly to composite fields , and the amount of admixture in a given sm fermion determines its mass @xcite . in this picture , the @xmath2 is one of the higher resonances , built out of the same preons as the wimp and @xmath16 .",
    "rs theories provide a very motivated picture of the uv physics , but more generically , in any theory containing composite wimps and composite top quarks belonging to a common sector one would expect strong couplings between them as a residual of the strong force which binds them , and perhaps negligible coupling to the rest of the standard model .    if the @xmath2 mixes with the electro - weak bosons , this results in strong constraints from precision data .",
    "we circumvent these constraints by considering a @xmath2 whose mixing with the @xmath15 is kinetic . at large @xmath2 masses",
    "this is not operationally different from the mass - mixing case , but it allows us to consider lower mass @xmath2s which are not ruled out by precision data .",
    "mediated production of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at clic.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      since the coupling of @xmath2 to light sm fermions is suppressed by the small kinetic mixing factor , the best probe of the dark sector is through the top portal . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath2 can be produced by being radiated from top quarks , as illustrated in fig.[fig : diagram ] .",
    "there are very interesting signals at the lhc @xcite . in this note",
    ", we look at the prospects at @xmath0 colliders . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection ] , we show the leading order cross section at clic for @xmath19 production , as calculated by calchep 2.5.4 @xcite . depending on the masses and couplings , the @xmath2 will predominantly decay into @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or into light fermions .",
    "decays into top quarks lead to four - top events with a very large cross section compared to the sm four - top rate , which leads to a characteristic same - sign di - lepton signature @xcite ( see also @xcite for studies of a @xmath22 final state at the lhc ) .",
    "the right - handed nature of the @xmath2 coupling to top quarks implies top polarisation also provides an interesting observable .",
    "when the @xmath2 decays into wimps , a @xmath23 missing energy final state results , which is particularly compelling at high energy @xmath0 colliders such as clic .",
    "we present preliminary results of an analysis aimed at characterising these signals in multi - tev @xmath0 collisions .",
    "signal events are generated using calchep , assuming @xmath24 , and subsequently hadronised with pythia  6.125  @xcite .",
    "we assume the beams to be unpolarised .",
    "events are processed through full detector simulation using the geant-4-based mokka  @xcite program and reconstructed with marlin - based  @xcite processors assuming a version of the ild detector  @xcite , modified for physics at clic .",
    "the performances most relevant to the analysis of these events are a relative parton energy resolution at 1  tev @xmath25  0.08 - 0.10 , charged particle momentum resolution @xmath26 = 2@xmath2710@xmath28  gev@xmath29 , track extrapolation resolution of 5  ( @xmath30 m ) @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "we perform jet clustering forcing the number of jets to the number of top quarks expected in the signal final state of interest .",
    "jet reconstruction is performed with the durham algorithm  @xcite . in this preliminary study",
    "we do not account for machine induced backgrounds and do not attempt to perform a detailed top reconstruction through the identification of its @xmath33 decay , which will need to be evaluated in a more refined analysis .",
    "we now discuss both signatures in turn .",
    "the standard model background for @xmath34 is dominated by @xmath35 , which , at 3 tev , has a cross section of 4.1 fb . by comparison , the signal cross section for @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 gev",
    ", @xmath38 is 16.5  fb ( note that this choice of parameters leads to the correct relic density for dark matter @xcite ) . for a higher mass @xmath39 gev",
    ", the cross section is 7.6  fb .",
    "the event selection requires 2 @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of natural jets obtained with the durham algorithm for @xmath42 = 0.0025 , more than 50 particles with @xmath43 0.5  gev , total reconstructed energy in the detector larger than 500  gev , transverse energy larger than 250  gev , event thrust larger than 0.75 and sphericity lower than 0.30 .",
    "the missing energy in the event , @xmath44 , appears to be the best discriminating variable against the sm @xmath45 `` irreducible '' background .",
    "figure  [ fig : t4 ] shows the @xmath46 invariant mass distribution for 1  ab@xmath29 of integrated luminosity at 3  tev .",
    "the signal is clearly visible over a negligible sm background . for @xmath47 = 360  gev",
    "there are 240 signal events in the mass peak around the generated @xmath2 mass .",
    "the @xmath2 mass can be determined with a statistical accuracy of @xmath48  3.5  gev .    to conclude , @xmath3 and multi - top production are expected signatures for several processes at , and beyond , the tev frontier .",
    "they have the advantage that the irreducible sm background is small so that they can provide clean probes of new physics .",
    "they also carry experimental challenges from the reconstruction of a large number of partons , with missing energy and leptons .",
    "the prospects for studying these signatures at the lhc are promising @xcite . in this contribution",
    ", we started investigating these signatures at @xmath0 colliders using a template model but it is clear that this work can be useful to other models having similar final states .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussion with jean - jacques blaising , marcel vos and ambroise espargilire .",
    "we are grateful to the organisers of the lc09 workshop in perugia for their invitation to an interesting and well - organised meeting .",
