    "<S> systems with long - range interactions quenched into a metastable state near the pseudospinodal exhibit nucleation that is qualitatively different than the classical nucleation observed near the coexistence curve . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed nucleation droplets in our langevin simulations of a two - dimensional model of martensitic transformations and have determined that the structure of the nucleating droplet differs from the stable martensite structure . </S>",
    "<S> our results , together with experimental measurements of the phonon dispersion curve , allow us to predict the nature of the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications for nucleation in many solid - solid transitions and the structure of the final state .    </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding challenge in the physics of solid - solid phase transformations is to understand the nucleation and growth of the transformed phase in strain based materials such as martensites , ferroelectrics , and multiferroics . although ideas based on classical nucleation theory have been invoked to describe nucleation phenomena in these materials  @xcite , it is possible that the presence of long - range elastic forces substantially influences the probability of nucleation and subsequent growth that determines processing and material behavior . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the transformation susceptibility determined by nucleation is one of the basic factors for the hardenability of steels . </S>",
    "<S> even though heterogeneous nucleation , which is sensitive to the distribution of appropriate structures in the parent phase from which product phase nuclei may be triggered , has long been considered important for martensites  @xcite , homogeneous nucleation also has been observed if the transformational driving force is sufficiently large . however , due to the difficulty of experimentally determining nucleation droplet structure in martensites  @xcite , very little is quantitatively known about the morphology of the nucleating droplet or `` embryo , '' including its size distribution or nucleation rate for homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation . the aim of this work is to probe for the first time the nature of the nucleating droplet and associated fluctuations by performing mesoscale simulations using realistic nonlinear models for martensites . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the classical theory does not accurately describe the structure of the nucleating droplet , but that concepts associated with nucleation near a spinodal  @xcite account for the observed droplet morphology . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our work provides the basis for investigating nucleation in systems where long - range elastic forces crucially determine the morphology .    </S>",
    "<S> long - range elastic interactions are important in strain based materials , such as martensites , and result from the requirement of compatibility of strain components which is necessary to preserve the continuity of the elastic media  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to systems with long - range interactions as near - mean - field , and use several characteristics of mean - field theory to study nucleation in these systems . </S>",

    "<S> the error in the nucleation time is much less than for @xmath28 because the slower growth in @xmath147 for @xmath39 makes fewer of the interventions ambiguous . a snapshot of the field at @xmath157 is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these results are important for nucleation in many functional materials with long - range interaction in which strain couples to some other physical variable , e.g. polarization ( in ferroelectrics ) , magnetization ( in magnetoelastics ) , and other multiferroics . </S>",
    "<S> we found that in elastic systems the description of nucleation is subtle due to the presence of bulk / interface elastic compatibility contraints that are manifested as long - range interactions . in summary , when the austenite is quenched to near the pseudospinodal , the structure of the nucleation droplet is different than the structure of the stable martensite phase . if the curvature of the phonon dispersion curve at small @xmath51 is positive , then @xmath28 and the droplet is homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> if the curvature is negative , then @xmath39 and the droplet is modulated with a wavelength @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters we used are consistent with austenite to martensite transitions in fepd . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , therefore that the classical nucleation picture is not applicable to these transitions and that the spinodal nucleation scenario is the better approach to understanding these transitions . </S>"
