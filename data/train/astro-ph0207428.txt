    "einstein and rosat observations show that at high energies most nearby ( spiral ) galaxies are dominated by a relatively small number of discrete , compact , but highly luminous x - ray sources .",
    "these so - called ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) have luminosities of @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , far in excess of the eddington limit for spherical accretion onto a neutron star ( roberts and warwick 2000 ) .",
    "nearly 20% of ulxs appear to be associated with supernova remnants ( snr , roberts et  al .",
    "2002 ) , while the rest are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object .",
    "one possibility is that ulxs represent the missing class of intermediate mass ( @xmath7m@xmath8 ) black holes ( colbert and mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "however , recent chandra observations reveal a strong association between ulxs and active star - forming regions ( fabbiano et  al .",
    "2001 , lira et  al .",
    "2002 ) , that are far too young to contain massive black holes ( king et  al .",
    "subsequently , at least two alternative scenarios have been proposed . in the first , ulxs are stellar mass black hole binaries undergoing a period of super - eddington accretion ( e.g. watarai et  al .",
    "2001 , begelman et  al . 2002 ) . in the second ,",
    "the apparent super - eddington luminosities are due to the beamed x - ray emission from an otherwise normal intermediate / high - mass x - ray binary ( king et  al .",
    "2001 , georganopoulos et  al . 2002 ) . while both scenarios tie in neatly with the observed association between ulxs and active star forming regions ( long et  al .",
    "2002 , terashima and wilson 2002 , zezas et  al .",
    "2002 ) , the latter requires a significantly larger number of ulxs to be present .",
    "roberts et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) identified the first optical counterpart to a ulx , ngc  5204  x-1 , based on its chandra position and optical multi - fibre spectroscopy .",
    "the counterpart , located within 1  of the nominal chandra position , displays a blue featureless continuum and is surrounded by an ionized bubble of gas with a diameter of some 360  pc ( pakull and mirioni 2002 ) . here , we present archival hst / wfpc2 v and i band images of this source , together with an improved analysis of the multi - fibre data .",
    "these data allow us to place more robust constraints on the nature of the counterpart , and thus obtain a deeper insight into the ulx phenomenon .",
    "we have obtained archival hst / wfpc2 v and i band ( f606w and f814w ) images of the dwarf magellanic type galaxy ngc  5204 ( fig  1 - upper panel ) .",
    "this data ( now public ) was obtained as part of an ongoing hst / wfpc2 snapshot survey of nearby dwarf galaxies ( seitzer , pi ) .",
    "the hst / wfpc2 v and i band images ( fig  1 , lower panel ) show that the optical counterpart can be resolved into at least two sources , here designated hst-1 and hst-2 , separated by 0.47  .",
    "we also identify a third source designated hst-3 , located 0.8  to the east of the nominal chandra position .",
    "this source was not detected in the fibre data of roberts et  al .",
    "but due to its close proximity remains a possible counterpart to the ulx .",
    "the observed separations correspond to distances of 10@xmath016  pc at the distance of ngc  5204 ( 4.8  mpc ) .",
    "we have performed psf fitting photometry on the v and i band images using hstphot ( dolphin 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , only one image was available in each filter , hampering cosmic ray rejection . given the difficulty of identifying real point sources , we decided against iterative adjustment of hstphot s standard psfs on the basis of the fit residuals .",
    "the chip positions , ra , dec , v and i band magnitudes ( referenced to a 0.5  aperture ) , colours , and distances from the nominal chandra position ( @xmath9 ) , are quoted in table  1 for each source .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     our hstphot photometry reveals that all sources are blue ( i.e. @xmath10 decreases with increasing @xmath11 ) , consistent with the finding of roberts et .",
    "for a single unresolved source .",
    "however the two fainter sources are significantly bluer than hst-1 .",
    "the combined magnitudes of hst-1 and hst-2 are 20.1 in v and 19.6 in i , with a v@xmath0i colour of 0.5 .",
    "these magnitudes are referenced to a 0.5  aperture , becoming 20.0 and 19.5 when corrected to infinite aperture .",
    "we do not include hst-3 in the combined magnitude estimate , as it does not fall within the same fibre in the data of roberts et  al .",
    "the best - fit chandra position for the ulx ( determined using wavdetect ; freeman et  al .",
    "@xmath1213  29  38.61 , @xmath13 + 58  25  05.7  is located 0.34  east of hst-1 .",
    "the 1@xmath14 error associated with the chandra reference frame is @xmath15 ",
    "( aldcroft et  al .",
    "however , errors of up to 1.0  are not uncommon when linking the chandra and hst reference frames ( see e.g. grindlay et  al .",
    "thus while hst-1 is the preferred location for the optical counterpart , neither hst-2 or hst-3 can be ruled out .",
    "we have reanalysed the optical multi - fibre data on ngc  5204  x-1 from roberts et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) with the aim of improving the photometric accuracy of their spectrum .",
    "this allows a direct comparison of their results with our new results from hstphot .",
    "our new analysis takes better account of fibre throughput corrections ( using an improved throughput image , with repeatability errors of @xmath16% ) and contamination by the nightsky background .",
    "more importantly , we have also tried to correct for diffuse emission from within the host galaxy .",
    "the reconstructed multi - fibre image of our source , shows that emission from the optical counterpart lies within a single central fibre and its surrounding nearest 6 neighbours .",
    "if we adopt the procedure followed by roberts et  al . and correct for nightsky background only , we derive a v - band magnitude of 19.9 . this is 0.2 magnitudes fainter than found by roberts et  al . ; this difference is due partly to our improved throughput correction and partly to the use of a median ( instead of a mean ) nightsky background .",
    "as noted above , we have also tried to account for diffuse emission from the host galaxy , which shows a clear west - east gradient ( see fig  1 ) .",
    "we do this by taking a median of the local background continuum over 18 fibres arranged in a hexagonal ring @xmath17 arcseconds from the source .",
    "this avoids including source flux in the background fibres . as in roberts et  al . the resultant spectrum ( fig  2 ) is blue and featureless at the resolution of our instrument ( 6  per 2 pixel resolution element ) .",
    "however , removal of local galaxy contributions results in a cleaner , fainter , and marginally bluer spectrum . the measured flux near 5500    translates to a v - band magnitude of @xmath18 .",
    "this is 0.7  mag fainter than the magnitude quoted by roberts et  al . and 0.4  mag fainter than that derived from the hst / wfpc2 v - band image .",
    "the discrepancy between the wht v - band flux estimate and that determined directly from the hst / wfpc2 v - band image most likely results from the intermittent presence of high cloud during some of the ground - based observations .",
    "this gives an indication of the accuracy of the absolute spectral flux calibration of the fibre data .",
    "roberts et  al . ( 2001 ) found that the optical counterpart to ngc  5204  x-1 was unlikely to be a galactic foreground object , but could not rule out the possibility that it was a background bl  lac .",
    "this was because the derived x - ray to optical slope @xmath19 , lies well within the parameter range occupied by bl  lacs .",
    "however , a recent measurement of the radio - flux at 8.3 ghz with the vla ( wong et  al . 2002 ) , shows the source to be radio faint ( @xmath20j ) , yielding an upper limit to @xmath210.08 .",
    "this places the source well outside the parameter space occupied by bl  lacs and confirms the status of ngc  5204  x-1 as a bona - fide ulx .",
    "the hst / wfpc2 colours show that our composite wht spectrum , which is dominated by the brighter and significantly redder source , must flatten towards longer wavelengths .",
    "based on the colours alone , hst-1 has an apparent spectral type f2-f5 , hst-2 is type a2 , and hst-3 type b5-b6 ( zombeck 1990 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the three sources are @xmath22 ( hst-1 ) , @xmath23 ( hst-2 ) , and @xmath24 ( hst-3 ) , which at the bare minimum requires @xmath251 - 2 f supergiants , @xmath252 - 3 a2 supergiants , and @xmath252 - 3 b5 supergiants respectively .",
    "however , a much more likely scenario is that the colours are representative of young stellar clusters .",
    "indeed there is increasing evidence to support such an idea .",
    "zezas et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) find several instances of ulx / young stellar cluster coincidences in the antennae galaxies .",
    "further , based on its location and colour , one of the two optical counterparts to the known ulxs in ngc  4565 has been associated with a globular cluster located in the outer bulge of this galaxy ( wu et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in figure 4 we show v@xmath0i colours as a function of age for three stellar cluster models .",
    "each model assumes a single instantaneous burst of star formation .",
    "the adopted stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is here represented by a powerlaw with slope 2.35 between the low- and high - mass cut - offs and approximates the classical salpeter imf ( salpter 1955 ) , appropriate for most observations of star - forming regions .",
    "two of the models are from the starburst99 models of leitherer et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the solar metallicity model of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) , which highlights the effect of adopting a smaller lower mass cut - off .",
    "if each of our sources represents a stellar cluster , and the clusters are co - eval , then fig  4 shows that the observed v@xmath0i band colours are broadly consistent with young stellar clusters with ages between @xmath26  yrs .",
    "furthermore , asuming that the clusters have the same metallicities , then the low - metallicity model is inconsistent with the v@xmath0i colour of hst-1 , and the age constraint is tightened to between @xmath27  yrs .",
    "this timescale is much shorter than the formation timescale of a low mass x - ray binary , @xmath28  yrs , but is consistent with the formation timescale of an intermediate / high mass x - ray binary , @xmath29  yrs ( king et  al .",
    "2001 ) .    by comparing the absolute v - band magnitudes , with the v - band magnitudes predicted by the nuclear starburst99 models of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we estimate the number of cluster members to be between several hundred ( hst-3 ) and a few thousand stars ( hst-1 ) .",
    "we note that the upper limit to our source `` sizes '' ( a few pcs at the distance of ngc  5204 ) are consistent with cluster sizes determined for nearby starburst galaxies ( 2 - 3 pcs , see meurer et  al . 1995 ) .",
    "we have used archival hst / wfpc2 v and i band images to show that the previously reported optical counterpart to the ultra - luminous x - ray source ngc  5204 x-1 , can be resolved into two sources separated by 0.47  . we have also identified a third possible counterpart 0.8  east of the nominal chandra position .",
    "all three sources appear blue ( i.e. @xmath10 decreases with increasing @xmath11 ) , with the fainter sources being significantly bluer .",
    "psf fitting photometry with hstphot yields source magnitudes of 20.3 , 22.0 and 22.4 in v. assuming that all three sources are co - eval , the v@xmath0i band colours suggest that ngc  5204  x-1 lies within a young ( @xmath3010  myr ) stellar cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that ulxs are intermediate / high - mass x - ray binaries .",
