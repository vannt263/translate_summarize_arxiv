    "the scalar channels in the region up to 1 gev became a stumbling block of qcd .",
    "the point is that both perturbation theory and sum rules do not work in these channels because there are not solitary resonances in this region .    at the same time",
    "the question on the nature of the light scalar mesons is major for understanding the mechanism of the chiral symmetry realization , arising from the confinement , and hence for understanding the confinement itself .",
    "the qcd lagrangian is given by + @xmath8=@xmath9 + @xmath10 is a diagonal matrix of quark masses , @xmath11=@xmath12=@xmath13 @xmath10 mixes left and right spaces .",
    "but in chiral limit , @xmath14@xmath150 , these spaces separate realize @xmath16 flavour symmetry , which , however , is broken by the gluonic anomaly up to @xmath17 as experiment suggests , confinement forms colourless observable hadronic fields and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry with massless pseudoscalar fields .",
    "there are two possible scenarios for qcd at low energy .",
    "1 . non - linear @xmath7 model .",
    "2 . linear @xmath7 model ( lsm ) .",
    "the experimental nonet of the light scalar mesons , @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , @xmath20(700 - 900 ) , @xmath21 and @xmath1 mesons , suggests the @xmath16 lsm .",
    "hunting the light @xmath7 and @xmath20 mesons had begun in the sixties already and a preliminary information on the light scalar mesons in pdg reviews had appeared at that time .",
    "but long - standing unsuccessful attempts to prove their existence in a conclusive way entailed general disappointment and an information on these states disappeared from pdg reviews .",
    "one of principal reasons against the @xmath7 and @xmath20 mesons was the fact that both @xmath22 and @xmath23 scattering phase shifts do not pass over @xmath24 at putative resonance masses .",
    "situation changes when we showed that in lsm there is a negative background phase which hides the @xmath7 meson in @xmath2 .",
    "it has been made clear that shielding wide lightest scalar mesons in chiral dynamics is very natural .",
    "this idea was picked up and triggered new wave of theoretical and experimental searches for the @xmath7 and @xmath20 mesons .",
