    "granular gases ( gases of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles ) exhibit a plethora of symmetry - breaking instabilities and clustering phenomena @xcite .",
    "their investigation is useful both for testing and improving the models of granular flow , and for a deeper understanding of far - from - equilibrium dynamics in general . in this work",
    "we focus our attention on a recently discovered phase separation instability which occurs in a prototypical two - dimensional granular system : an assembly of monodisperse hard disks in a box , colliding inelastically with each other and driven , at zero gravity , by a rapidly vibrating or thermal wall .",
    "an immediate consequence of the inelasticity of the particle collisions is the formation of a laterally uniform cluster ( the stripe state ) at the wall opposite to the driving wall @xcite .",
    "both granular hydrodynamics and direct molecular dynamic simulations show that this simple clustering state can exhibit spontaneous symmetry - breaking instability leading to phase separation : coexistence of dense and dilute regions of the granulate ( droplets and bubbles ) along the wall opposite to the driving wall @xcite .",
    "this far - from - equilibrium phase separation is strikingly similar to the gas - liquid transition in the classical van der waals model .",
    "the objective of this work is a systematic investigation of the steady states in this system and computation of the phase diagram starting from the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics .",
    "granular hydrodynamics is expected to be an accurate leading order theory when the mean free path of the particles is much less than a characteristic inhomogeneity scale of the problem , and the mean time between two consecutive collisions of a particle is much less than any time scale the hydrodynamics attempts to describe .",
    "in addition , we should work with sufficiently low particle densities , when an account of binary collisions and volume exclusion effects is sufficient @xcite .",
    "as will be shown below ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the requirement that the mean free path be small compared to the inhomogeneity scale implies in this system that particle collisions must be nearly elastic .    for steady states with a zero mean flow ,",
    "granular hydrodynamic equations reduce to granular _ hydrostatics _ , see section 2 .",
    "the hydrostatic problem is fully described by three scaled parameters introduced below : the area fraction of the particles @xmath0 , the aspect ratio of the box @xmath1 and the effective hydrodynamic inelastic heat loss parameter @xmath2 @xcite . by solving the hydrostatic equations numerically ,",
    "we obtain , in section 2 , the spinodal line and the critical point of the phase separation in the limit of @xmath3 .",
    "section 3 deals with the same limit of @xmath3 but , in addition , assumes a close proximity to the critical point .",
    "here we find the spinodal and binodal ( coexistence ) lines analytically and determine the structure of the steady - state domain wall , separating the more dense and less dense stripes in the lateral direction .",
    "effects of finite aspect ratio @xmath1 are addressed in sec .",
    "4 . these include suppression of the phase separation by heat conduction in the lateral direction and a change from a supercritical to subcritical bifurcation .",
    "section 5 includes a brief discussion of the results and proposes directions of future work .",

    "these relations were derived by analogy with those obtained in the framework of a successful but still empiric enskog theory @xcite .",
    "detailed comparisons with molecular dynamic simulations shows that the error margin of the enskog heat conductivity can reach as much as 10 - 15 percent @xcite .",
    "still , these relations seem to be the best available constitutive relations for moderate densities .",
    "importantly , most of the analytical results in this work are written in a more general form which only assumes a navier - stokes structure of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the jenkins - richman s relations are used only for computing numerical factors .",
    "energy input at the thermal wall balances the energy loss due to inter - particle collisions , so we assume that the system reaches a steady state with a zero mean flow . therefore , the full hydrodynamic equations reduce to hydrostatic equations : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the granular pressure , @xmath21 is the granular temperature , @xmath22 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath23 is the rate of energy loss by collisions .",

    "as was already mentioned , for the hydrodynamics to be quantitatively accurate , the mean free path of the particles must be much less than any hydrodynamic length scale .",

    "whose size is comparable to the mean free path , hydrodynamics is inapplicable , while the particle velocity distribution significantly deviates from maxwell distribution : the temperature of the incoming particles is less than that of the outgoing particles [ as the outgoing particles have their normal velocity randomized according to a maxwell distribution with a ( fixed ) higher temperature ] .",

    ", the pressure of the system is reduced ( notice that the density does not change in this order ; it can change only in the next , burnett order ) .",

    "@xmath321 implies an extremely small inelasticity @xmath322 . despite the severe limitation intrinsic to it ,",
    "the nearly elastic case is conceptually important , just because hydrodynamics is supposed to give here a quantitatively accurate leading order theory .",
    "an interesting direction for future work is the phase separation _ dynamics_. here the hydrostatic equations should give way to the full set of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "close to the critical point , however , a reduced description of the dynamics should be possible .",
    "it has been suggested that such a description is provided by the  van der waals equation \" @xcite .",
    "though the van der waals equation does capture qualitatively much of the phenomenology of the phase separation as seen in the md simulations @xcite , its systematic derivation from the equations of granular hydrodynamics is still lacking , and the coefficients of the normal form are yet unknown .",

    ", fully agree with those predicted from the van der waals normal equation .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ bin120 ] ) provides quantitative relations between the yet unknown coefficients of the van der waals equation .",
    "another avenue of future work requires going beyond hydrodynamic description , as it includes two types of fluctuations in this system .",
    "the first of them was observed in molecular dynamic simulations inside the spinodal region at @xmath323 ( that is , far from the critical point ) in a wide region of aspect ratios around the finite - size threshold value @xmath312 @xcite .",
    "it was found that these fluctuations dominate the dynamics of the system , so they were called giant fluctuations .",
    "the second type of fluctuations is expected to occur , by analogy with the classical van der waals phase transition , in a close vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the fluctuations in these two regimes should be describable in the framework of  fluctuating hydrodynamics \" of landau and lifshitz @xcite , generalized to granular gases in the limit of nearly elastic collisions .",

    "the fluctuations appear in this approach as a hydrodynamic response of the system to the langevin noise .",
    "unfortunately , this exciting direction of work is hindered by the fact that the langevin term , which accounts for the discreteness of the inelastic energy loss in the energy equation , has yet to be calculated @xcite .",
