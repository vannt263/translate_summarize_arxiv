    "multiterminal ( mt ) source coding , which was introduced by berger @xcite and tung @xcite in 1977 , defines the problem of separate compression and joint decompression of multiple correlated sources subject to distortion constraints .",
    "finding the achievable rate region for the general mt problem is very hard , hence research has been focusing on the quadratic gaussian case when the sources are jointly gaussian and the distortion measure is the mean - squared error .",
    "the sum - rate part of the achievable rate region of the quadratic gaussian mt problem is of particular interest and has been characterized for several special instances .    by connecting the quadratic gaussian mt source coding problem to the quadratic gaussian ceo problem @xcite , wagner _",
    "@xcite showed sum - rate tightness of the berger - tung ( bt ) rate region for the two - terminal and positive - symmetric cases .",
    "@xcite then provided an alternative proof based on an estimation - theoretic result , which also leads to a sufficient condition for bt sum - rate tightness .",
    "yang and xiong @xcite started with a generalized quadratic gaussian ceo problem and proved sum - rate tightness in the bi - eigen equal - variance with equal distortion ( beev - ed ) case .",
    "although the beev - ed case satisfies the sufficient condition given in @xcite , the proof technique for the converse theorem is different and examples more explicit .",
    "wang _ et al .",
    "_ s sufficient condition @xcite is so far the most inclusive condition for bt sum - rate tightness , and its converse proof consists of the following steps .",
    "first , a set of @xmath0 virtual sources , referred to as the remote sources , were constructed such that the given @xmath0 mt sources can be viewed as independently gaussian corrupted versions of the remote sources .",
    "then , they used an estimation - theoretic result in conjunction with the semidefinite partial ordering of the distortion matrices to give a lower bound on the mt sum - rate .",
    "finally , an optimization problem was formulated to find the best lower bound over possible ( conditional and unconditional ) distortion matrices , with the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) condition given and simplified to prove their main result .",
    "an important assumption that enables their proof is that the observation noises between the virtual remote sources and the mt sources are independent gaussian with a _ diagonal _ covariance matrix .",
    "since the rate - distortion function for independent gaussian random sources is completely known , this assumption dramatically simplifies the lower bound and hence the optimization problem .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new and more inclusive sufficient condition than wang _",
    "s @xcite for bt sum - rate tightness .",
    "the main novelty is to consider a larger set of remote sources , such that the observation noises between the mt and remote sources have a _ block - diagonal _ covariance matrix , instead of a diagonal matrix as assumed in @xcite . by restricting the noise covariance matrix to have @xmath1 @xmath2 diagonal blocks and @xmath3 @xmath4 diagonal blocks",
    ", we build a connection between the @xmath0-terminal problem and @xmath1 two - terminal problems with _ matrix - distortion _ constraint .",
    "unfortunately , although the original quadratic gaussian two - terminal source coding problem with _ individual _ distortion constraint has been completely solved @xcite , the exact minimum sum - rate for its variant with a matrix - distortion constraint is still unknown in general .",
    "a composite lower bound is already provided by wagner _ et al .",
    "we partially improve the composite lower bound in this paper , using a technique inspired by wang _",
    "s work @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this improvement can be infinitely large in some extreme cases .",
    "however , our new lower bound does not always match the bt upper bound , leaving a bounded gap between them .",
    "our new lower bound for the matrix - distortion constrained two - terminal problem is then utilized to give a new sum - rate lower bound on the @xmath0-terminal problem . after forming an optimization problem to search for the best @xmath0-terminal lower bound , we characterize the generalized kkt condition based on the subgradient @xcite of the objective function , which is convex , continuous , but non - differentiable .",
    "finally , our new sufficient condition is obtained by simplifying the subgradient - based kkt condition .",
    "examples with tight sum - rate bound are also given .",
    "the set of sum - rate tightness problems defined by our new sufficient condition subsumes all previously known tight cases , including wagner _",
    "s positive - symmetric case , wang _ et al . _ s sufficient condition , and yang and xiong s beev - ed case , thanks to the following two novelties .",
    "first , replacing wang _",
    "s independence assumption on the observation noises with a block - independent one leads to a larger repertoire of remote sources that serve as the basic tools for deriving the sum - rate lower bound .",
    "second , the partially improved composite bound for the matrix - distortion constrained two - terminal problem gives a wider range of subgradients , hence a more relaxed subgradient - based kkt condition .",
    "it is worth noting that , our new condition even includes degraded cases where the target distortions are not simultaneously achieved in the optimal bt scheme .",
    "this is the first time a degraded case is proved to have a tight bt sum - rate bound .",
    "in addition , the technique introduced in this paper might be further generalized to allow @xmath5 ( or even larger ) block size in the observation noise covariance matrix to yield even more new tight cases , if one can explicitly give a lower - bound on the corresponding matrix - distortion constrained three - terminal problem .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives the formal definition of the quadratic gaussian mt source coding problem and reviews existing results on sum - rate tightness .",
    "section iii studies the two - terminal source coding problem with matrix - distortion constraint , and provides an improved lower bound on the sum - rate .",
    "section iv states our main results on a new sufficient condition for sum - rate tightness , and presents a degraded example belonging to the block - degraded case that satisfies our new condition .",
