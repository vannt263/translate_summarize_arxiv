    "this poses a unique problem for defining the trajectory of a _ billiard ball _ [ idx : snowflakebilliard](i.e .",
    ", a pointmass traversing the interior of the planar region bounded by the koch snowflake @xmath0 ) . specifically , when this pointmass collides with the boundary @xmath0 with unit speed , the absence of a well - defined tangent results in multiple choices for the angle of reflection , meaning there is a priori no well - defined angle of reflection . in @xcite",
    ", we provided experimental evidence in support of the existence of certain periodic orbits of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , we stated several conjectures about the existence of a well - defined billiard @xmath4 and the dynamical equivalence between the conjectured billiard flow on @xmath4 and the associated geodesic flow on the proposed corresponding ` _ _ fractal flat surface _ _ ' .",
    "one of the main objectives of the present paper is to investigate what one means by _ reflection _ in the snowflake boundary and to establish the existence and describe the topological and geometric properties of particular families of periodic orbits ( and/or of their footprints ) of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath4 .    in short , the point of view adopted here is to define certain `` periodic orbits '' of @xmath4 as suitable ( inverse ) limits of certain `` compatible sequences '' of periodic orbits of its ( inner ) rational polygonal billiard approximations @xmath2 . using this definition and a study ( conducted in  3 ) of the periodic orbits of the @xmath3th prefractal billiard approximation [ idx : omegaksi]@xmath2 , for each fixed @xmath1 , we characterize and describe ( in terms of the ternary expansion of their initial basepoint ) the periodic orbits with an initial direction making an angle of @xmath9 with the horizontal in @xmath5 .",
    "more specifically , we are able to construct what we call the _ footprint _ of the _ primary piecewise fagnano _ and _ piecewise fagnano _ orbits , and _ stabilizing periodic orbits _ of @xmath4 ( all in the direction of @xmath9 ) . as of now",
    ", the only family of well - defined orbits of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath4 is the family consisting of what we call _ stabilizing orbits_. that which we propose to be a piecewise fagnano orbit of @xmath4 has a footprint @xmath12 that is the inverse limit of footprints ( of piecewise fagnano orbits ) of the prefractal approximations . a footprint of a prefractal approximation amounts to the poincar section of the billiard map describing the billiard flow on the corresponding phase space .",

    "generalized piecewise fagnano orbits_. again , there really is no orbit to speak of , nor is there any footprint to speak of .",

    "this paper draws upon various subjects in mathematics .",
    "so as to accommodate a diverse audience of readers , we make a considerable effort in developing the necessary background material in  2 . in particular , we give a thorough description of the billiard flow associated with a billiard table @xmath20 with ( piecewise ) smooth boundary @xmath21 .",
    "we also recall the notion of a _ flat surface _ and how one can construct a flat surface from a _ rational polygonal billiard table _",
    "( that is , a planar billiard table whose boundary is a polygon with interior angles that are rational multiples of @xmath22 ) . in this context ,",
    "a flat surface is a mathematical device used to rigorously describe the billiard flow on @xmath20 in terms of the geodesic flow on the surface .",
    "in addition , we recall the definition of _ inverse limit _ and explain how the cantor set @xmath10 can be viewed as the inverse limit of an _ inverse limit sequence _ of its prefractal approximations , denoted by @xmath23 , with the index @xmath3 corresponding to the approximation with @xmath24 many points . similarly , the snowflake curve @xmath0 can be viewed as the inverse limit of its prefractal approximations @xmath13 . here , @xmath13 is the @xmath3th ( inner ) polygonal approximation to @xmath0 , and hence defines a rational polygonal billiard table @xmath2 .",
    "since the theory of rational polygonal billiards is very well developed ( see , e.g. , [ gastvo , gu1,guju12,husc , kaha2,kaze , mas , masta , ve13,vo , zo ] ) , it is then natural to define the dynamics on the fractal `` billiard table '' @xmath4 in terms of the dynamics on its prefractal approximations @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "much of the focus of this paper will be to first obtain a good understanding of the periodic orbits of @xmath2 , and then to provide a plausibility argument as to why we can view piecewise fagnano orbits on @xmath4 as suitable ( inverse ) limits of appropriate sequences of piecewise fagnano orbits on @xmath2 , for @xmath1 .",
    "it is our intention that those familiar with the topic of mathematical billiards and not fractal geometry find readily accessible the basic notions of self - similarity and that of an iterated function system ( ifs ) .",
    "we briefly describe these notions by means of a simple example in  [ subsec : compseqpf ] and refer the reader to various references for further details ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we prove that the _ prefractal flat surface _ @xmath6 associated with the koch snowflake prefractal billiard @xmath2 is a _ _ branched cover _ _ of the _ hexagonal torus _ @xmath8 .",
    "we then use this result to show that initial directions of periodic orbits in the billiard @xmath5 are exactly the initial directions of periodic orbits in the billiard @xmath2 , and vice - versa .",
    "this key fact serves as the foundation for  4 .",
    "it is there that we develop much of the machinery necessary to describe what we call _ compatible sequences of periodic orbits_. further discussion about the nature of particular points in the unit interval @xmath25 [ idx : unitinterval](which we always view as the base of the equilateral triangle @xmath26 ) gives rise to specific _",
    "compatible sequences_. we note that  4 is very dense , serving as a strong foundation for  5 . while the addressing system used in  5 ( and introduced and used in @xcite ) may seem to make some of the tools developed in  4 redundant , in principle , many of the proofs of the results in  5 demonstrate the interconnectedness of the two sections , making the implicit ( and even explicit ) dependence of  5 on  4 readily apparent .    therefore , we model the structure of  5 on that of  4 , so as to allow the reader to draw parallels more quickly and to see how the results in  4 influence our later study of the periodic orbits of the koch snowflake billiard .",
    "in  4 , we show that directions for which an orbit @xmath27 of @xmath2 are periodic are exactly the same for which an orbit @xmath28 of @xmath5 is periodic .",
    "this aids us in constructing what we call a _ compatible sequence of closed orbits_. we focus our investigation on orbits with an initial direction of @xmath9 . as such",

    "[ subsec : plausibilityargument ] , we then provide a plausibility argument for the existence of what we call a _ piecewise fagnano orbit _ of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we close  5 by conjecturing the existence of _ generalized piecewise fagnano orbits _ of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath4 .",
    "considering the fact that the field of `` fractal billiards '' is still in its infancy , we provide many open questions and conjectures in  6 .",
    "in particular , we stress that @xmath4 does not constitute a well - defined mathematical billiard , in the sense that we have not provided a well - defined phase space , let alone a geodesic flow on such a phase space .",
    "such a mathematical object has yet to be precisely defined , but the work we have laid out in  5 and the remarks made in  6 indicate a possible path for constructing such a phase space and geodesic flow .",
    "in addition to determining the nature of such a geodesic flow and whether it could be dynamically equivalent to the billiard flow , we ask questions regarding the _ ergodic _ nature of the conjectured geodesic and billiard flows on the hypothesized ` fractal flat surface ' and the corresponding fractal billiard .",
    "we then state an open question asking whether or not it is possible to construct analogs of various classical trace formulas ( e.g. , the gutzwiller trace formula ) which can be used , in the classical billiard case , as a tool for connecting the length spectrum of particular billiards and the eigenvalue spectrum of the laplacian defined on their associated fractal drums .    in the long - term , we hope that the present ( preliminary ) study of the koch snowflake billiard will help lay the foundations for a general theory of fractal billiards .      at this point , we would like to provide the reader with an index of notation .",

    ", we will attempt to establish some sufficient condition for the fractal analogue of the veech dichotomy to hold for other fractal flat surfaces .",
    "another important and long - term goal for the continuation of this project is the study of the connections between the length spectrum ( i.e. , the lengths of the periodic orbits of the given fractal billiard ) and the spectrum of the dirichlet or neumann laplacian ( or of another hamiltonian ) on the associated fractal drum ( or ` drum with fractal boundary ' , as in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the relevant references therein ) .",
