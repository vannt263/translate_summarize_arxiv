    "mimo schemes also offer the potential for significant performance gains in a variety of other metrics .",
    "standard transceiver architectures for these schemes include linear precoding and equalization , and the combination of linear precoding and decision feedback equalization ( dfe ) , which offers the potential for improved performance over the linear approach while maintaining comparable complexity . for scenarios in which accurate channel state information ( csi ) is available at both the transmitter and the receiver ,",
    "there is a well established framework that unifies the design of linear transceivers under many design criteria @xcite .",
    "a counterpart for the design of systems with dfe has recently emerged @xcite .",
    "this framework was also extended to mimo systems with pre - interference subtraction at the transmitter in @xcite . however , in many scenarios , such as frequency division duplex systems , obtaining accurate csi at the transmitter may require a considerable amount of feedback to the transmitter .",
    "an approach that allows the designer to limit the required amount of the feedback is to quantize the transmitter design . in these limited feedback schemes",
    "@xcite , the receiver uses its csi to choose the best transmitter design from a codebook of available designs , and then feeds back the index of this precoder to the transmitter .",
    "this strategy has been considered for beamforming schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , unitary precoding with linear equalization ( e.g. , @xcite ) . and",
    "unitary precoding for orthogonal space time block codes @xcite . for zero - forcing dfe schemes , a limited feedback scheme in which the receiver feeds back the order of interference cancellation was proposed in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the design of a limited feedback scheme for systems with a ( general ) linear precoder at the transmitter and zero - forcing dfe at the receiver .",
    "our designs are based on a unified framework , developed herein , for the joint design of the precoder and the zf - dfe in the presence of perfect csi .",
    "this framework embraces a wide range of design criteria that can be expressed as functions of the mean square error ( mse ) of each data stream , including minimization of the total mse , minimization of the average bit error rate ( ber ) , and maximization of the gaussian mutual information .",
    "in particular , we show that the optimal precoder for systems with a zero - forcing dfe is the same for all these criteria ; a property that can not be achieved by a linear transceiver .",
    "furthermore , we show that the optimal precoder for these objectives is a scaled unitary matrix that is isotropically distributed ( over the stiefel manifold of unitary matrices ) . using this distribution",
    ", we show that codebooks constructed from grassmann subspace packings minimize an upper bound on an average distortion measure , and hence are excellent candidates for the codebook in limited feedback schemes for systems with zero - forcing dfe .",
    "in contrast , the application of grassmann codebooks in limited feedback schemes with linear receivers ( e.g. , @xcite ) involves an inherent compromise , because the optimal precoder in the presence of perfect csi and a total power constraint is not unitary . since the scheme that we propose involves",
    "the construction of codebooks for isotropically distributed unitary matrices , our scheme subsumes that in @xcite , in which the precoder is , by construction , a permutation matrix .",
