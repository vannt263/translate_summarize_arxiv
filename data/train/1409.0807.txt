    "quantification of quantum correlations in composite quantum systems is a topic of great current interest @xcite . for pure states",
    "such correlations can be identified with entanglement , which can be measured by the entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "entanglement has been shown to be useful as a resource for quantum teleportation @xcite and pure state based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "for mixed states , however , the situation becomes more complex and different measures have been introduced , such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has recently become clear that entanglement is not the only type of non - classical correlation that a mixed quantum state can exhibit @xcite .",
    "most separable mixed states states , defined as convex mixtures of product states @xcite , can still possess a non - zero value of the quantum discord @xcite , defined as the minimum difference between two quantum versions of the classical mutual information , or equivalently , the classical conditional entropy @xcite . and",
    "a finite discord has been shown to be present @xcite in the mixed state based algorithm of knill and laflamme @xcite , able to achieve an exponential speed up over the classical algorithm with vanishing entanglement @xcite . since then , several other measures of non - classical correlations for mixed states , sharing common basic properties with the quantum discord , were introduced @xcite , and various operational implications of discordant states have been provided @xcite .",
    "entropy optimization is a central feature in many of these measures . in particular , the quantum discord for a bipartite system",
    "requires the minimization of the von neumann conditional entropy obtained as a result of a local measurement on one of its components , over all such measurements , which turns its evaluation difficult ( recently shown to be np - complete @xcite ) in the general case .",
    "this conditional entropy is also interesting by itself , since it measures the average conditional mixedness of the unmeasured component after a measurement on the other . for pure states",
    ", this conditional entropy vanishes for _ any _ local measurement based on rank one projectors , as the post - measurement state will be pure and separable .",
    "the optimization problem arises then only for mixed states , for which the degree of mixedness of the unmeasured side depends on the measurement performed on the other side .",
    "in addition , its minimum represents the entanglement of formation between the unmeasured component and a third partner purifying the whole system @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the general properties of this measurement dependent conditional entropy for _ general _ entropic forms .",
    "this allows , in particular , to consider simple entropies like the so - called linear entropy ( a quadratic form in the state @xmath1 ) , which is directly related to the purity and whose minimization in a qudit - qubit system for measurements on the qubit can be exactly determined @xcite . in this work we first provide a clear geometric picture of the optimization problem in a qudit - qubit system in terms of the _ correlation ellipsoid _ , which represents the set of post - measurement states of the unmeasured side and depends on the correlation tensor @xmath2 of the system and the reduced state of the qubit",
    "it is shown that the exact optimization of the quadratic entropy directly follows the largest semi - axis of this ellipsoid , maximizing correlation access .",
    "we then extend this approach to a general entropic form , deriving a quadratic ( in @xmath2 ) approximation to the conditional entropy valid for a sufficiently small correlation ellipsoid .",
    "the optimization problem becomes then equivalent to the minimization of a @xmath0 quadratic form , being thus exactly solvable and similar to that for the quadratic entropy with an _ effective _ correlation tensor which takes into account the local concavity of the entropy .",
