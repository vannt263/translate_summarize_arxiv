    "the appearance of directed motion enhanced by thermal fluctuations has been named after the ratchet effect @xcite .",
    "the idea of applying the ratchet mechanism to model pumps has already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "prost and co - workers @xcite studied the transport of an asymmetric pump with a simple two - level model and quantified how vectorial symmetry plus dissipation creates a macroscopic motion , even in the absence of any externally applied gradient .",
    "astumian and derenyi @xcite investigated a chemically driven molecular electron pump in which charge can be pumped through a tiny gated portal from a reservoir at low electrochemical potential to on at the same or higher electrochemical potential by cyclically modulating the portal and gate energies .",
    "kosztin and schulten @xcite studied the fluctuation - driven molecular transport through an asymmetric potential pump and three transport mechanisms : driven by potential gradient , by an external periodic force and by nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "nonadiabatic electron heat pump was investigated by rey and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they presented a mechanism for extracting heat metallic conductors based on the energy - selective transmission of electrons through a spatially asymmetric resonant structure subject to ac driving .",
    "wambaugh and co - workers @xcite studied the transport of fluxons in superconductors by alternating current rectification .",
    "they found that at nonzero temperatures , the asymmetric geometry of the ratchet sawteeth automatically converts applied ac inputs into a net dc motion of fluxons . in their another work @xcite , they studied how inertia and particle pair interactions can induce transverse rectification of particle flows driven through square arrays or chains of triangular defects perpendicularly to their symmetry axis . recently , sancho and gomez - marin @xcite presented a model for a brownian pump powered by a flashing ratchet mechanism . the pumping device was embedded in a finite region and bounded by particle reservoirs .",
    "their emphasis is on finding what concentration gradient the pump can maintain .",
    "the previous works on pump were on the consideration of the energy barriers .",
    "the present work is extend to the study of the molecular pump to the case of the entropic barriers .",
    "the entropic barriers may appear when coarsening the description of a complex system for simplifying its dynamics @xcite .",
    "we emphasize on finding how the brownian particles can be pumped through an asymmetric tube from a particle reservoir at low concentration to one at the same or higher concentration in the presence of an unbiased external force .",
    "our other task is on investigation what factors can affect the pumping capacity .",
    "we consider overdamped brownian particles moving in an asymmetric finite tube [ fig .",

    "when the particles move in a confined media , its movement equation can be described by the fick - jacobs equation @xcite which is derived from the 3d ( or 2d ) smoluchowski equation after elimination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coordinates by assuming equilibrium in the orthogonal directions .",
    "the complicated boundary conditions of the diffusion equation in irregular channels can be greatly simplified by introducing an entropic potential that accounts for the reduced space accessible for diffusion of the brownian particle .",

    "the positions of the negative peak and positive peak are determined by the parameters of the system . in order to illustrate the transport behavior , currents @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath44 versus @xmath17 for @xmath61",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath62 and @xmath55 , @xmath59 is more than @xmath63 , so the current @xmath44 is positive .",

    "in fact , the sign of the current is determined by the asymmetry of the tube .",
    "the corresponding shape of the tube is given by fig .",
    "it is obvious that the initial coordinate @xmath17 determines the asymmetry of the tube .",
    "when the left space of the tube is bigger than the right ( @xmath64 ) , the particles run to the right in the presence of the unbiased external force .",
    "the particles move to the left when the right space is bigger ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "there is no current for the symmetric tube ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "hence , the system can pump the particles from the left to the right for @xmath62 and @xmath55 .",
    "we take @xmath64 in the rest study .",
    "we now focus on the maximum concentration ratio at both end of the tube .",
    "the analytical results are given by eq .",

    ", we investigate the pumping capacity and see how the concentration ratio depends on temperature @xmath10 , the radius @xmath69 at the bottleneck and the amplitude @xmath21 of the external force .",

    "the curve is observed to be bell shaped .",
    "when @xmath70 , the particles can not reach all space of the tube and the effect of the asymmetric entropic barrier disappears and there is no pumping capacity ( @xmath71 ) . when @xmath72 , the effect of the unbiased external force disappears and the pumping capacity goes to zero , also",
    ". therefore , there is an optimized value of @xmath10 at which the ratio takes its maximum value , which indicates that the thermal noise can facilitate the particles pumping .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 as a function of the radius @xmath69 at the bottleneck is plotted in fig .",
    "when @xmath73 , no particle can pass through the tube , thus , @xmath74 . with increasing of the radius @xmath69 , the effect of the asymmetric entripic barrier reduces and the pumping capacity decreases .",
    "figure 7 shows the ratio @xmath67 vs the amplitude @xmath21 of the unbiased external force . when @xmath75 , only the effect of the asymmetric entropic barrier exists , so the system has no pumping capacity .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 saturates to @xmath76 in the large amplitude @xmath21 limit .",
    "therefore , the pumping capacity is maximum when @xmath21 takes an optimized value .      in fig .",
    "8 , the current @xmath44 versus temperature @xmath10 is presented for different values of @xmath78 at @xmath79 . for lower values of @xmath78",
    "the current is larger . when @xmath77 , the current is negative for both too low or too high temperature .",
    "when @xmath70 , the effect of the asymmetric entropic barrier disappears , the concentration difference dominates the transport , thus , the current is negative .",
    "when @xmath72 , the effect of the unbiased external force disappears , the transport is dominated by the concentration difference and the particles move to the left . if the concentration difference exceed its maximum value , the current will be always negative .",
    "figure 9 shows the current @xmath44 as a function of the radius @xmath69 at @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the curve is observed to be bell shaped .",
    "when @xmath73 , the tube is jammed and the particles can not pass through the tube .",
    "when @xmath81 , the effect of the asymmetric entropic barrier disappears , and the current is dominated by the concentration difference , thus the current is negative .",
    "so there exists an optimized value of @xmath69 at which the current takes its maximum value .",
    "in this study , we study the transport of brownian particles moving in an asymmetric finite tube in the presence of an unbiased external force . the pumping device is embedded in a finite region and bounded by two particle reservoirs .",
    "it is found that the particles can be pumped from low concentration reservoir to higher concentration reservoir . when @xmath51 , the current is positive for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , zero at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , negative for @xmath86 .",
    "the sign of the current is determined by the asymmetry of the tube .",
    "the maximum ratio of the concentrations ( @xmath68 ) at both ends of the tube is also studied .",
    "we can find that there is an optimized value of temperature @xmath10 ( or the amplitude @xmath21 of the external force ) which gives the maximum ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 decreases with increasing the radius @xmath69 at the bottleneck of the tube .",
    "we also study the current @xmath44 as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that the current can tend to its maximum value when @xmath10 or @xmath69 take the optimized value .",
    "though the model presented does not pretend to be a realistic model for a biological pumps , the results we have presented have a wide application in many systems , such as na , k - atpase pumps @xcite , membrane proteins @xcite , and electron pumps @xcite .",
