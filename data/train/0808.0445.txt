    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heavy fermion system has attracted much attention as a subsequent study of high - temperature superconductors and has recently been one of the central issues in the study of strongly correlated electron systems . for example , the heavy fermion material ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 shows a rapid change in the hall coefficient as a function of magnetic field at zero temperature , which is accompanied by the antiferromagnetic ( af ) to paramagnetic ( pm ) phase transition.@xcite also , heavy - fermion  like behavior is observed in the system of @xmath1he bi - layers adsorbed on graphite.@xcite generally speaking , competition between the magnetic ordering of localized spins through the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky)@xcite interaction and the nonmagnetic states induced by the kondo screening@xcite brings about the observed anomalous behaviors in heavy fermion materials . from the theoretical point of view , the periodic anderson model ( pam)@xcite is one of the simplified models for heavy fermion systems , which is believed to describe the competition between magnetic ordering and kondo singlet formation observed in heavy fermion materials .    in 2d quantum systems ,",
    "the symmetry - broken magnetically ordered state can be realized in the ground state at zero temperature and therefore one needs a method of calculation appropriate for infinite - size systems in the thermodynamic limit . in this paper",
    ", we therefore use the variational cluster approach ( vca)@xcite based on the self - energy functional theory ( sft)@xcite to consider the 2d periodic anderson model at half filling .",
    "although the self - energies of the small clusters are used in the vca calculations and thus the long - range spin fluctuations beyond the cluster size are not taken into account , the quantum fluctuations within the cluster are treated exactly in this approach .",
    "we may therefore expect that this approach should be applicable to describe the possible symmetry breaking of the model in the thermodynamic limit beyond the simple mean - field theory .",
    "we want to point out that the present calculation is the first one where the vca is applied to the 2d pam , as far as we know .",
    "we will show that , by means of vca , the symmetry breaking due to the af ordering of localized spins occurs in the strong coupling region , whereas in the weak coupling region , the kondo insulator without symmetry breaking is realized .",
    "the critical interaction strength will thereby be determined .",
    "we will also calculate the staggered magnetic moment as a function of the interaction strength and show that the phase transition is of the second order .",
    "we will furthermore calculate the single - particle spectra and densities of states ( dos ) to discuss the effects of electron correlation on the quasiparticle band structure .",
    "we will thus show how the system changes from the af insulator , kondo insulator , to the band insulator , with decreasing the interaction strength .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we present our model and method of calculation . in sec .  [ sec : results ] , we present our results of calculations for the stability of the af ordering , staggered magnetic moment , single - particle spectra , and dos by vca .",
    "we summarize our work in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider the pam defined on the 2d square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 is the annihilation operator of an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 in the conduction - electron @xmath7 ( @xmath8-electron @xmath8 ) orbital , and @xmath9 is the electron number operator in the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "@xmath10 is the hopping parameter between the nearest - neighbor @xmath7 orbitals , @xmath11 is the on - site hybridization parameter between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals , @xmath12 is the on - site repulsion on the @xmath8 orbital , and @xmath13 is the energy level of the @xmath8 orbital with respect to that of the @xmath7 orbital set to be the origin of energy . in the following calculations , we consider the symmetric case , i.e. , the case with @xmath14 .",
    "we also focus on the electron densities at half filling , i.e. , @xmath15 electrons in the @xmath16 unit cells , where the unit cell contains one @xmath7 and one @xmath8 orbital .",
    "we hereafter set @xmath17 as the unit of energy and we change the value of the interaction strength @xmath12 .",
    "let us first briefly review the formulation of sft@xcite and present the method of calculation of the magnetic ordering by vca@xcite in order to make our paper self - contained .",
    "we consider the system of the hamiltonian @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the one - particle and interaction parameters of @xmath21 , respectively . in general , the grand potential is given from the stationary point of the self - energy functional @xmath22=f[\\sigma]+{\\rm tr}\\ln[-(g_0^{-1}-\\sigma)^{-1}],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 are the legendre transform of the luttinger - ward potential @xmath25 $ ] and the bare green function , respectively . the rigorous variational principle @xmath26/\\delta\\sigma=0 $ ] gives the dyson equation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the physical green function .    in the above expression ( 2 ) , @xmath23 $ ] is a universal functional of the self - energy ; i.e. , @xmath23 $ ] remains unchanged for an arbitrary reference system of the hamiltonian @xmath29 that has the same interaction part as the original system has , but with modified one - particle parameters .",
    "we here introduce the restriction of the space of the exact self - energies of the original system to the set of exact self - energies of the reference system . because of this restriction",
    ", the following procedure becomes approximate but it enables us to obtain the grand potential of the original system from the stationary point of the @xmath30 functional @xmath31=\\omega ' & + & { \\rm tr}\\ln[-(g_0^{-1}-\\sigma({\\bm t'}))^{-1 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & -&{\\rm tr}\\ln[-({g'}_0^{-1}-\\sigma({\\bm t'}))^{-1 } ] , \\label{eq : omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath30 , and @xmath33 are the grand potential , exact self - energy , and bare green function of the reference system , respectively . the condition @xmath34/\\partial{\\bm t'}=0 $ ] gives an appropriate reference system that describes the original system approximately .    in vca",
    ", we first divide the original infinite lattice into the finite - size identical clusters . by switching off the hopping parameters between the identical clusters , we construct the reference system as an assembly of the exactly solvable finite - site clusters .",
    "one of the major advantages of vca is its ability to describe the symmetry - breaking long - range order by introducing suitably chosen fictitious symmetry - breaking weiss fields in the set of variational parameters @xmath35 . in order to discuss the competition between the af ordering and kondo screening in the parameter space , we here introduce staggered magnetic field @xmath36 on the @xmath8 orbitals in the cluster hamiltonian as a variational parameter .",
    "we thus obtain the hamiltonian of the reference system , @xmath37 , which is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the label of the clusters , @xmath5 and @xmath40 are the labels of the sites within the cluster @xmath39 , and @xmath41 .    in the present study ,",
    "we use a 6-site ( @xmath42 ) cluster to search for the stationary point of @xmath43 $ ] with a condition @xmath44/\\partial h'=0 $ ] as discussed above .",
    "we should note that the shape of the cluster introduced as a reference system is not commensurate with the af ordering .",
    "we therefore treat a 12-site ( @xmath45 ) cluster as a supercell by combining the two 6-site clusters .",
    "we treat the intercluster hopping elements as well as the hopping elements between the supercells `` perturbatively'';@xcite i.e. , we use the self - energies of the 6-site clusters to calculate the green function of the original infinite system as well as that of the reference systems ( an assembly of the identical 12-site clusters ) via the dyson equation and obtain the values of @xmath43 $ ] for various values of @xmath36 by using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "+    it is known that the af ordering of the @xmath8 electrons is realized in the ground state of the strong coupling region of pam ( as well as kondo - lattice model ) in 2d.@xcite we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ critical ] , where the calculated values of @xmath43-\\omega[\\sigma(0)]$ ] per site for several values of @xmath12 near the critical point are shown .",
    "we find the following : ( i )  the value has a minimum at a finite value of @xmath36 for @xmath46 , which indicates that the symmetry - broken af ordering is stabilized for @xmath46 .",
    "( ii )  the value of @xmath36 at which @xmath43-\\omega[\\sigma(0)]$ ] has a minimum approaches 0 with decreasing @xmath12 to @xmath47 .",
    "( iii )  the critical value of @xmath12 is determined as @xmath48 .",
    "this value is comparable to ( but is slightly smaller than ) the result of the quantum monte carlo calculation@xcite where the value @xmath49 is reported .",
    "the reason of the overestimation of the af stability in vca may be explained as follows : in the vca calculation , we use the cluster representable self - energies , i.e. , exact self - energies of small clusters , as the trial self - energies .",
    "thus , the long wave - length spin fluctuations beyond the cluster size are not taken into account.@xcite also , we use the staggered magnetic field on the @xmath8 orbitals @xmath36 as a single variational parameter , which suppresses the quantum spin fluctuations . this may also be responsible for the overestimation .",
    "( iv )  for @xmath50 , we find the minimum at @xmath51 , which indicates that there is no long - range af ordering in the system .",
    "+    in fig .",
    "[ moment ] , we show calculated results for the staggered magnetic moment of the @xmath8 orbitals @xmath52 and @xmath7 orbitals @xmath53 per site at zero temperature , which are defined by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the grand potential of the system per site and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is the external staggered magnetic field acting on the @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) orbitals . we find the following : ( i )  the staggered magnetic moment of the @xmath8 electrons decreases continuously to 0 when we decrease the value of @xmath12 from the strong coupling region to @xmath58",
    "thus , the phase transition is of the second order .",
    "( ii )  the staggered moment of the @xmath7 electrons also shows the similar behavior but the polarization is of the opposite sign .",
    "( iii )  the obtained staggered moments may be overestimated as in the case of the hubbard model in 2d,@xcite which is due again to the overestimation of the stability of the af ordered state in vca as discussed above .",
    "we also point out that the calculated staggered moments @xmath52 and @xmath53 are found to show a power - low behavior in the vicinity of the transition point as @xmath59 with the exponent @xmath60 , which is consistent with the mean - field value @xmath61 within the numerical accuracy .",
    "thus , the vca calculation , which neglects the long - range spin fluctuations beyond the cluster size , gives the results equivalent to those of the simple mean - field approximation at least in the description of the critical behaviors such as the critical exponent .",
    "+    we then calculate the single - particle spectra@xcite defined by the imaginary part of the `` fourier transform '' of the optimized physical green function.@xcite we also calculate the dos from the @xmath62-space integration of the imaginary part of the optimized physical green function .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , where we use the af brillouin zone when the system is in the symmetry - broken af state ( see figs .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ) , but for nonmagnetic states , we use the standard first brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( c ) ) .    in fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( a ) , i.e. , for @xmath63 , we can first identify the `` upper and lower hubbard bands '' for the @xmath8 electrons , which are almost dispersionless and are separated by an energy @xmath64@xmath12 .",
    "we can also identify the lower - energy dispersive bands in fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( a ) . here",
    ", we use the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) dispersion to fit the spectra .",
    "the sdw dispersion can be obtained by diagonalizing the sdw hamiltonian @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 where a and b are the sublattice indices , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the effective hybridization parameter and effective energy level of the @xmath8 orbital , respectively , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the staggered magnetic moment of the @xmath8 ( @xmath7 )",
    "orbitals , and @xmath71 .",
    "we assume @xmath69 and @xmath70 to have the values obtained in eqs .",
    "( 6a ) and ( 6b ) and we fix @xmath68 to be 0 .",
    "we determine the value of @xmath67 so as to reproduce the size of the sdw gap .",
    "we find that the fitting works well for the dispersions of the lower - energy bands but the spectral weight on the @xmath8 orbital differs very much from that of the vca calculations since the upper and lower hubbard bands for the @xmath8 electrons do not appear in the sdw spectral functions .",
    "we then find the value @xmath72 from the fitting , indicating that the quasiparticle is not quite heavy .",
    "in other words , with increasing @xmath12 , the af ordering occurs in 2d before the quasiparticle mass is strongly enhanced .    in fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( b ) , i.e. , for @xmath73 , we find that the localized energy level is not well defined but there is a band repulsion in the spectra at @xmath74 .",
    "the spectral weight of the @xmath8 electrons becomes large near the fermi energy for all the momenta .",
    "also , by comparing the results of the non - interacting case ( @xmath75 ) , the sharp peak just below the fermi energy is observed in the partial dos of the @xmath8 orbital ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that this peak not only arises from the hybridization but is caused by the many - body resonance , which corresponds to the kondo resonance peak in the metallic state .    in fig .",
    "[ spectra ]  ( c ) , i.e. , for @xmath76 , where there is no af ordering in the system , we find that the spectra look very similar to the spectra of non - interacting case . however , we again find that the localized energy level is not well defined but there is a weak band repulsion in the spectra at @xmath74 .",
    "+    to clarify the behavior in the weak - coupling region where there is no af ordering , i.e. , @xmath50 , we calculate the spin and charge gaps defined as @xmath77 and @xmath78/2 $ ] , respectively , where @xmath79 is the ground - state energy of a cluster with @xmath80 up - spin and @xmath81 down - spin electrons .",
    "because the two - particle green functions can not be calculated directly from vca , we here use an exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters .",
    "we use the 8-site , 16-orbital cluster with periodic boundary condition to calculate the ground - state energies and estimate the spin and charge gaps . in fig .",
    "[ gap ] , we show the ratio of the spin gap to the charge gap @xmath82 thus obtained as a function of @xmath12 , where the result only at @xmath50 ( with @xmath58 determined in sec .",
    "iii a ) is shown because no phase transition occurs in finite - size systems .",
    "we find @xmath83 for all values of @xmath12 @xmath84 , indicating the system to be in the regime of the kondo insulator;@xcite i.e. , there is no long - range af ordering , where localized spins are screened by the formation of the kondo singlet state .",
    "as @xmath12 decreases to 0 , we find that the two gaps tend smoothly to the same value , i.e. , @xmath85 , indicating the system tends to the non - interacting band insulator .",
    "in summary , we have applied the vca based on the sft for the first time to consider the symmetric pam at half - filling in 2d .",
    "we have thus demonstrated the validity of the approach by discussing in particular the competition between antiferromagnetism and kondo screening in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature .",
    "we have shown that the symmetry - broken af ordering of localized spins is realized in the strong coupling region @xmath46 and the kondo insulating behavior is realized in the weak coupling region @xmath50 .",
    "we have determined the critical interaction strength as @xmath48 .",
    "we have calculated the staggered magnetic moment as a function of the interaction strength and have shown that the phase transition is of the second order .",
    "we have also calculated the single - particle spectra and density of states .",
    "we have thereby discussed the effect of electron correlations on the quasiparticle band structure .",
    "we have applied an exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters to calculate the ratio of the spin gap to charge gap in the weak coupling region and found that the kondo insulating state continuously tends to the non - interacting band insulator with decreasing the value of @xmath12 to 0 .",
    "we thus have shown that the present approach is very useful for considering the electronic states of pam in 2d . to improve the accuracy of our results",
    ", one may introduce additional variational parameters , such as the hopping terms , to take into account the quantum fluctuations more efficiently and suppress the overestimation of the stability of the af ordering , which we want to leave for future studies .",
