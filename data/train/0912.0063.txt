    "@xmath0 the catenoid is the simplest minimal surface in @xmath1 except the plane . it is obtained by revolving the catenary about an axis . the catenoid has been characterized by many authors .",
    "for instance :    * the catenoid is the only nonplanar minimal surface which is a surface of revolution ( bonnet @xcite ) . *",
    "the catenoid is the only complete embedded minimal surface of total curvature @xmath2 ( osserman @xcite ) . *",
    "a complete minimal surface with two annular ends and of finite total curvature is the catenoid ( schoen @xcite ) . *",
    "a complete embedded nonplanar minimal surface of finite total curvature and genus zero is the catenoid ( lpez and ros @xcite ) .    for more interesting characterizations",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , one can also characterize a proper subset of the catenoid . + in 1869 , enneper @xcite proved that a compact nonplanar minimal surface which is generated by one - parameter family of circles is part of the catenoid or riemann s example . in 1956 , shiffman @xcite proved that a minimal annulus bounded by two horizontal circles is foliated by horizontal circles .    in this paper we will also characterize a proper subset of the catenoid .",
    "our characterizations involves the hypothesis of a constant contact angle along the boundary of the minimal surface as follows :    let @xmath3 be an immersed minimal annulus such that @xmath4 consists of two @xmath5 planar jordan curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 . if @xmath3 makes a constant contact angle with a plane @xmath8 along @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , then @xmath3 is part of the catenoid .",
    "let @xmath3 be an immersed minimal surface with boundary and let @xmath12 be one component of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath12 is a circle and @xmath3 meets a plane along @xmath12 at a constant angle , then @xmath3 is part of the catenoid .",
    "note that in theorem 1.1 it is not necessary to assume that the planes @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parallel .",
    "also it should be mentioned that wente @xcite proved every embedded annular capillary surface in a slab is a surface of revolution .",
    "but he also constructed many examples of immersed non - zero constant mean curvature ( henceforth abbreviated as cmc ) annular capillary surfaces lying in a slab which are not surfaces of revolution @xcite .",
    "the author would like to express his gratitude to professor j. choe for his guidance and encouragement .",
    "@xmath0 first , we review the hopf differential .",
    "let @xmath3 be an annulus in @xmath1 which is the image of a conformal immersion @xmath15 of a planar annulus @xmath16 .",
    "suppose @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the isothermal coordinates on @xmath19 determined by @xmath15 .",
    "we can write the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form of @xmath3 as follows @xmath20 @xmath21 the hopf differential is the quadratic differential defined by @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "then the codazzi equation implies the following lemma .",
    "( see @xcite or @xcite . )",
    "@xmath25 is holomorphic on a cmc surface .",
    "second , we review some properties of umbilic points of a cmc surface .",
    "umbilic points of @xmath3 are the zeros of @xmath25 .",
    "lines of curvature of @xmath3 flow smoothly except at umbilic points .",
    "they rotate sharply around at an umbilic point .",
    "so we can define the rotation index of the lines of curvature at interior umbilic points .",
    "+ now we extend the rotation index to a boundary point . let @xmath26 be a boundary point .",
    "we choose @xmath27 which is a conformal immersion of a half disk @xmath28 into the regular surface @xmath3 mapping the diameter @xmath29 of @xmath30 into @xmath4 .",
    "the lines of curvature of @xmath3 can be pulled back by @xmath15 to a line field on @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is a line of curvature of @xmath3 , then this line field can be extended smoothly to a line field @xmath33 on @xmath34 by reflection about the diameter @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath33 has the well - defined rotation index at @xmath35 and furthermore , the rotation index does not depend on the choice of immersion @xmath15 .",
    "so we can naturally define the rotation index of the lines of curvature at the umbilic point @xmath36 to be half the rotation index of @xmath33 at @xmath35 .",
    "( @xcite , lemma 2 ) + let @xmath3 be a non - totally umbilic immersed cmc surface which is of class @xmath5 up to and including the boundary @xmath4 .",
    "if the @xmath4 are lines of curvature , then we have the following .",
    "+ ( a ) the boundary umbilic points of @xmath3 are isolated .",
    "+ ( b ) at an interior umbilic point the rotation index of lines of curvature is not bigger than @xmath37 .",
    "+ ( c ) at a boundary umbilic point the rotation index of lines of curvature is not bigger than @xmath38 .",
    "we now recall bjrling s theorem ( see @xcite ) . let @xmath39\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^3 $ ] be any real analytic curve and @xmath40\\rightarrow \\mathbb{s}^2 $ ] be any real analytic vector field perpendicular to the tangent vector of the curve @xmath41 . by the analyticity of @xmath42 , there are unique analytic extensions @xmath39\\times(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}^3 $ ] , and @xmath40\\times(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}^3 $ ] , where @xmath43 is a small enough positive number . using these extensions , we define the unique immersion of surface as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45\\times(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon).$ ] by a straightforward computation , this is a minimal immersion that extends @xmath42 and @xmath46 in the sense that for @xmath47\\times \\{0\\}$ ] , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the surface normal .",
    "_ proof of theorem 1.1 .",
    "_ * step 1 . *",
    "we claim that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parallel .",
    "+ let @xmath50 be a conformal immersion of @xmath3 . because @xmath3 is a minimal surface , @xmath51 on @xmath19 , where @xmath52 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath3",
    "so we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the outward pointing unit conormal vector along @xmath9 , @xmath10 . by the boundary maximum principle @xcite , @xmath55 ( see ,",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath56 be the domain bounded by @xmath6 .",
    "the projection of @xmath57 to @xmath13 is a normal vector field of @xmath6 , and it is constant length . by the divergence theorem on @xmath58 ,",
    "we see that the non - zero vector @xmath59 is perpendicular to @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , the non - zero vector @xmath60 is also perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
    "( [ eq : rt ] ) implies that the two vectors are linearly dependent .",
    "so @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parallel . +",
    "* step 2 . *",
    "we claim that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are convex .",
    "+ the terquem - joachimsthal theorem @xcite says that if @xmath63 is a line of curvature in @xmath64 , then @xmath12 is also a line of curvature in @xmath65 if and only if @xmath64 and @xmath65 intersect at a constant angle along @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath6 is a line of curvature of @xmath13 and @xmath3 meets @xmath13 in a constant contact angle along the @xmath6 , @xmath6 is also a line of curvature of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 is a line of curvature of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath66 , @xmath67 be the principal curvature of @xmath3 along @xmath6 , @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we want to show that neither @xmath66 nor @xmath67 has zeros .",
    "first , let us suppose that @xmath68 has zeros at finite points @xmath69 on @xmath70 , @xmath71 then @xmath69 , @xmath10 are the boundary umbilic points .",
    "let @xmath72 be the interior umbilic points . by the poincar - hopf theorem and lemma 2.2 , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the euler characteristic of @xmath3 and @xmath75 is the rotation index at @xmath76 .",
    "therefore neither @xmath77 nor @xmath78 has zeros .",
    "second , suppose either @xmath77 or @xmath78 has zeros at an infinite number of points . by lemma 2.1 , @xmath25 is a holomorphic function . since @xmath79 @xmath7 are compact sets , the hopf differential @xmath25 of @xmath3 is identically zero on the one or both of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "so @xmath25 is identically zero .",
    "this means that @xmath3 is a planar annulus . since @xmath11",
    ", this case can not happen .",
    "hence both @xmath66 and @xmath67 can not have zeros .",
    "let @xmath80 be the curvature of @xmath9 in @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath81 , @xmath80 can not be zero .",
    "so both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are convex .",
    "in fact they are strictly convex .",
    "+ * step 3 .",
    "* we claim that @xmath3 is part of the catenoid .",
    "+ by step 2 the total curvature of @xmath4 is @xmath82 . so by @xcite , @xmath3 is embedded ( see , figure 1 ) .",
    "+ hence we know that @xmath3 is a surface of revolution by @xcite .",
    "but we give a sketch of the proof for the sake of completeness .",
    "+ let @xmath18 be a unit vector in @xmath13 .",
    "now we apply the alexandrov reflection principle @xcite with the one - parameter family of plane @xmath83 which is orthogonal to @xmath18 . increasing @xmath84",
    "one gets a first plane @xmath85 that reach @xmath3 ; that is @xmath86 , but if @xmath87 then @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the part of @xmath3 lying in @xmath90 , @xmath91 and let @xmath92 be the symmetry of @xmath89 about @xmath83 .",
    "first , let us assume the first touching between @xmath3 and the reflected surface @xmath93 by @xmath94 for some @xmath95 occurs at an interior point . by the hopf maximum principle , @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath94 .",
    "second , let us assume the first touching between @xmath3 and @xmath96 for some @xmath97 occurs at a boundary point . since the contact angle is constant , the normal vector of @xmath3 at the touching point coincides with that of the reflected surface @xmath96 at the touching point .",
    "so we can use the hopf boundary maximum principle , then @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath98 .",
    "otherwise , let us assume the first touching between @xmath3 and @xmath99 for some @xmath100 occurs at a corner .",
    "similarly the second case , the normal vector of @xmath3 at the corner coincides with that of the reflected surface @xmath99 at the corner . because of constant of the contact angle we can apply the serrin s boundary point lemma at a corner ( lemma 2.6 of @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath101 .",
    "+ since the first touching must occur at an interior point , a boundary point or a corner , @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath102 . + by using the reflection principle for another unit vector @xmath103 in @xmath13 , we get that @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath104 . hence , we conclude that @xmath3 is a rotational surface , @xmath105 , it is part of the catenoid .",
    "@xmath106 +        _ proof of theorem 1.2 .",
    "_ without loss of generality denote the circle by @xmath107 .",
    "since the surface has constant contact angle @xmath108 along the @xmath42 , the surface normal vector becomes @xmath109 .",
    "then bjrling s formula ( [ eq : c1 ] ) yields the unique minimal surface @xmath110 @xmath111 for each @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "this means that the minimal surface is foliated by coaxial circles .",
    "so @xmath3 is part of the catenoid . @xmath106",
    "lemma 2.1 , lemma 2.2 and the poincar - hopf theorem hold for cmc surfaces .",
    "so we drive a characterization of a sphere after an additional assumption .",
    "let @xmath3 be an immersed non - zero cmc annulus such that @xmath4 consists of two @xmath5 planar jordan curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 . if @xmath3 makes a constant contact angle with a plane @xmath8 along @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , @xmath3 has at least one umbilic point",
    ". then @xmath3 is part of a sphere .",
    "if @xmath3 has only finite umbilic points then it is contradiction to the poincar - hopf theorem .",
    "so @xmath3 has infinitely many umbilic points .",
    "since the hopf differential @xmath25 is holomorphic , it is identically zero .",
    "hence , @xmath3 is part of a sphere .",
