    "<S> this demonstrates that our results are robust and do not depend on the specific values of the parameters , as long as there is soc and a finite concentration of low energy quasiparticles at the impurity sites as in the experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically the robustness of the zbs due to soc can be understood to be due to a combination of suppression of the superconducting gap by soc in the @xmath7 case and the properties of magnetic impurities in nearly isotropic gap superconductors . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , soc produces a relatively large spin splitting that pushes one fermi surface towards the x - point and the other towards the @xmath29-point . on the other hand , in @xmath7 pairing , the pairing potential changes sign between these two points in the brillouin zone </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as one fermi surface moves towards the @xmath31-point , the pairing amplitude is suppressed , so that one of the fermi surfaces would have a smaller gap . </S>",
    "<S> this suppressed gap is still quite isotropic and as shown in the appendix , for such isotropic fermi surfaces , one can prove that an infinitesimal magnetic impurity will support sub - gap states just as in the case of the shiba problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the gap is suppressed by soc , then the impurity - induced sub - gap state is pinned to live inside the smaller gap , even in the presence of a magnetic field , explaining the robustness of the zero bias peak to zeeman splitting . since the coherence peaks from the larger gapped fermi surfaces are expected to be larger </S>",
    "<S> , the smaller gap could appear as a pinned peak inside a larger gap .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the robust zbss induced by the multiple magnetic impurities for @xmath7-wave superconductor in the presence of soc . </S>",
    "<S> this addresses the so - called class - d anti - localization mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a large number of bound states to magnetic impurities in a superconductor with soc is described by random - matrix theory in symmetry class d. this symmetry class shows no level repulsion at zero energy . because of this , the disorder averaged density of states ( or the density of states of a large number of weakly localized bound states ) is expected to show a peak at zero energy quite generically independent of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in the present context , nearby multiple shiba impurities provide a second mechanism ( aside from soc ) of reducing the magnitude of local gap near a given magnetic impurity . by the argument given in the appendix , the zero bias peak at the given impurity </S>",
    "<S> will then stay pinned at zero energy even if the value of the soc is smaller , provided there is overlap of wave functions from states localized at nearby impurities . </S>",
