    "right after pauli formulated the neutrino postulate , fermi introduced the field theoretical treatment of the process @xmath3 in the early 1930 s @xcite .",
    "this is the first known example of a @xmath4-theory . in the ensuing years other forms of nuclear @xmath5 decays",
    "were observed , which prompted gamow and teller to formulate an @xmath6-theory .",
    "the concept of a new class of interactions , the _ weak interactions _",
    ", had just emerged .    both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 theories were fused into the @xmath7 theory by sudarshan and marshak and also independently by feynman and gell - mann in the late 1950 s , motivated by the discovery of parity non - conservation in weak interactions by lee and yang ( theoretically ) and wu and telegdi ( experimentally ) .    in this context",
    "the weak interactions are described by an effective lagrangian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant and the weak current @xmath10 has the @xmath7 structure .",
    "@xmath10 can be separated into weak leptonic @xmath11 and weak hadronic @xmath12 currents , namely , @xmath13 , where the leptonic current can be written directly in terms of the lepton fields whereas the hadronic one can be decomposed into parts having definite flavor su(3 ) transformation properties and can be written in terms of quark fields @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath14 however , faces many problems and can not be taken as a self - consistent quantum field theory of weak interactions . among other aspects ,",
    "_ i _ ) it is not renormalizable ; _ ii _ ) at high energies it leads to a violation of unitarity , i.e. , it brings in probability non - conservation ; and _ iii _ ) it has no room for neutral currents .    with the advent of gauge theories ,",
    "the cornerstone of the theory of weak interactions became the su(2)@xmath15u(1 ) weinberg - salam theory , which currently possesses a quite impressive experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "further work , both theoretical and experimental , has finally yielded to the standard model of elementary particles , which embodies our knowledge of the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to briefly review the achievements of the past thirty years of theoretical activity in baryon semileptonic decays ( bsd ) from the mexican perspective .",
    "we give a detailed account of bsd , focusing on techniques to the calculation of radiative corrections to observables which have been the major contribution of local research groups .",
    "the paper opens with a historical account of the development of the theoretical approach and continues with an application to the evaluation of radiative corrections to the spin - asymmetry coefficient of the emitted baryon .",
    "numerical results are discussed afterwards .",
    "the paper closes with a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "in dealing with the radiative corrections ( rc ) to bsd it is very important to have an organized systematic approach to deal with the complications that accompany them .",
    "these rc depend on an ultraviolet cutoff , on strong interactions , and on details of the weak interactions , other than the effective @xmath7 theory .",
    "in other words , they have a model - dependent part @xcite .",
    "they also depend on the charge assignments of the decaying and emitted baryons .",
    "their final form depends on the observed kinematical and angular variables and on certain experimental conditions . over the years",
    ", our approach to the calculation of these rc has been to advance results which can be established in as - much - as possible once and for all .",
    "this task is considerably biased by the experimental precision attained in given experiments and by the available phase space in each decay .",
    "a systematic study of the calculation of rc in bsd was initiated back in 1980 @xcite following an approach originally introduced by sirlin @xcite for the electron energy spectrum in neutron decay and later extended to the decay of polarized neutrons @xcite .",
    "an expression for the electron energy spectrum including radiative corrections was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was accurate enough to allow experimental analyses to be performed in a model - independent fashion , provided hard bremsstrahlung photons are experimentally discriminated . at that time , those results were not directly applicable to the experiments being performed , which had lower statistics and made no provision to discriminate against hard photons .",
    "later , in the same spirit , the rc to the differential decay rate of polarized neutral and charged baryons were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . from that result , obtaining the rc to the decay rates and angular coefficients was straightforward .",
    "this was the first attempt to obtain rc to integrated observables .",
    "a step further was taken in 1987 , when in order to improve previous results on the rc to the electron energy spectrum of baryon @xmath5 decay @xcite , a new theoretical expression was obtained , this time including all terms of order @xmath16 where @xmath1 is the four - momentum transfer and @xmath2 is the mass of the decaying baryon @xcite .",
    "the result is suitable for model - independent analyses of very - high - statistics experiments , without any experimental constraint on the detection of hard inner - bremsstrahlung photons . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the bremsstrahlung contribution to bsd can be computed in a model - independent way up to terms of first order in @xmath1 , by using the low theorem @xcite .    in the meantime , new high - statistics experiments in bsd @xcite made dalitz plot ( dp ) measurements feasible and the application of rc was necessary .",
    "much of the work had already been advanced in early calculations for the energy spectrum of the charged lepton and for the decay distribution of polarized baryons @xcite , so the new task was to adapt the results for the dp . in this respect ,",
    "an expression for the dp of semileptonic decays of charged and neutral baryons including rc to order @xmath17 and neglecting terms of order @xmath18 was introduced in ref .",
    "the virtual rc presented no new complications .",
    "in contrast , the bremsstrahlung rc became rather involved .",
    "the approximation implemented in that work was that the real photons are not observed directly but indirectly when the energies of the final baryon and charged lepton are found not to satisfy the final three - body overall energy - momentum conservation .",
    "in consequence , a detailed kinematical analysis for determining the integration limits over the photon variables was mandatory .",
    "besides , the infrared divergence in the bremsstrahlung had to be identified carefully along with the finite terms that accompany it . a proper choice of variables yielded the integrations feasible .",
    "no doubt this paper marked an important path toward new results .",
    "the immediate application was to the computation of rc to the dp to order @xmath16 , both for charged @xcite and neutral @xcite decaying baryons .",
    "in summary , from the early years of research we learned that following the analysis of sirlin of the virtual rc in neutron beta decay @xcite and armed with the theorem of low for the bremsstrahlung rc @xcite one can show that the model - dependent contributions to both corrections ( introducing new form factors ) contribute to orders @xmath19 with @xmath20 , while orders @xmath21 lead to model - independent final expressions , because their model dependence is absorbed into the already existing form factors .",
    "the rc to bsd obtained to these latter orders are then suitable for model - independent experimental analyses and are valid to an acceptable degree of precision in the near and intermediate future : they will be useful in bsd involving heavy quarks .",
    "there are six different charge assignments in bsd , namely , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that it is not necessary to calculate each case separately .",
    "the final results of the last four cases can be directly obtained from the final results of the first two cases .",
    "this saves a considerable amount of effort , since only the first two cases need be calculated in detail",
    ". such detail requires the choice of specific kinematic situations .",
    "it is the dp that is normally studied experimentally .",
    "however , energy - momentum conservation may allow to discriminate events where photons are emitted carrying away energy such that the bsd is placed outside the so called three - body region ( tbr ) of the dp of non - radiative bsd .",
    "the events with those photons belong to what we have referred to as the four - body region ( fbr ) .",
    "in addition , when the initial baryon is polarized the angular correlations between that polarization and the emitted baryon and the emitted charged lepton involve different rc , and it is not possible to obtain the final results of one correlation from the final results of the other correlation . back in the middle 1990 s the systematic study of rc to bsd was complete to both orders @xmath28 and @xmath29 for unpolarized decaying baryons so it was time to tackle new problems by considering the polarization of either the decaying or emitted baryons .",
    "after some work , the analysis was finished to order @xmath28 for polarized decaying baryons , covering the spin - final baryon momentum and spin - final charged lepton momentum angular correlations @xcite .",
    "those results were indeed useful for obtaining theoretical expressions for the angular spin asymmetry coefficients of the emitted baryon and charged lepton , respectively . within our approximations and after producing some numbers , our results agreed well with others already published @xcite .    nowadays",
    "our goal has been extended to cover both the spin - final baryon momentum and the spin - final charged lepton angular correlations to order @xmath29 of both neutral and negatively charged decaying baryons , restricted to the tbr .",
    "the former problem has been already solved @xcite whereas the latter is in progress .",
    "a further analysis will take into account the fbr contribution to the rc @xcite and also the polarization of the emitted baryon .",
    "this will be done in the near future .",
    "let us mention that up to this order our results will be useful in high - precision experiments involving heavy quarks .",
    "in the next sections we will describe how to apply our methods to get the rc to the tbr of the spin - final baryon momentum angular correlation to order @xmath29 .",
    "basically we borrow some recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite and analyze the case of a negatively charged decaying baryon in order to illustrate the procedure .",
    "for definiteness , let us consider the bsd @xmath30 and let @xmath6 denote a negatively charged baryon and @xmath31 a neutral one , so that @xmath32 represents a negatively charged lepton and @xmath33 its accompanying antineutrino .",
    "the four momenta and masses of the particles involved in process  ( [ eq : equno ] ) will be denoted by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , and by @xmath2 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite .",
