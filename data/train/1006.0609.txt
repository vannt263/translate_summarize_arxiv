    "galaxy redshift surveys will become an increasingly important source of cosmological information .",
    "the ongoing sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) will measure redshifts for 1.5 million luminous red galaxies over 10000deg@xmath1 , providing cosmic variance limited constraints out to @xmath2 .",
    "the next generation of ground - based surveys , using multi - object spectrographs on 4 m class telescopes will push this cosmic variance limit to @xmath3 ( e.g. bigboss ; @xcite ) .",
    "when going beyond these redshifts the space based experiments have benefits of no atmospheric contamination and larger angular coverage compared to the ground based surveys .",
    "european space agency ( esa ) _ euclid _ mission @xcite , currently in the definition phase , will be able to measure redshifts for galaxies out to @xmath4 , thus measuring large - scale structure for the full range of redshifts over which dark energy dominates , according to standard models . given the precision that these surveys will achieve , it is interesting to consider exactly how the measurements from these surveys can be used to measure the parameters of different cosmological models .",
    "future cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite will render the cosmological information available from the large - scale shape of the galaxy power spectrum or correlation function @xcite less interesting .",
    "instead , analyses will focus on using the galaxy distribution as a standard ruler to measure the expansion of the universe , and use the anisotropy and amplitude of clustering to measure the growth of structure within it @xcite .",
    "galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying matter density field and , on very large scales ( @xmath5 ) , the ratio between galaxy and matter power - spectrum is scale - independent and the galaxy distribution can be assumed to be a fair sample of matter overdensities . following the cosmological principle ,",
    "the galaxy distribution is expected to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic and measured correlation functions and power - spectra should be spherically symmetric in real space .",
    "one of the simplest measurements to make is the large scale amplitude of the galaxy 2-point clustering signal .",
    "however , this can not be simply related to the amplitude of fluctuations in the matter field because of galaxy bias and redshift space distortions ( rsd ) .",
    "galaxy bias arises through the physics of galaxy formation , which means that galaxies do not form a poisson sampling of the matter distribution .",
    "in addition dark matter haloes that host galaxies are biased with respect to the matter distribution .",
    "rsd are present because the measured redshift of a galaxy is not only caused by the hubble expansion but also has a contribution from the comoving peculiar velocity of each galaxy with respect to the hubble flow .",
    "since the peculiar velocities of individual galaxies depend on the overdensity field , the resulting clustering signal will be angle dependent @xcite .",
    "rsd have been measured using both correlation functions and power - spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when we use the galaxy distribution as a standard ruler , we have to model not only the distance to the galaxies , but also the rate at which distance changes with redshift : if we match surveys of small regions of the universe at different redshifts , then we need to match both the angular size ( related to the distances to the regions ) , _ and _ the depths of the regions . if we get the ratio of these two projection effects wrong , we see an anisotropic clustering pattern , which is called the alcock - palczynski ( ap ) effect @xcite",
    ". this effect is partially degenerate with the rsd @xcite . for a standard ruler that is small relative to scales over",
    "which cosmological expansion becomes important , we need the angular diameter distance @xmath6 to project each part of the survey to the correct distance , and the derivative of the radial distance @xmath7 to give each segment the correct depth @xcite .    because measurements of geometry and rsd are correlated , the cosmological parameter measurements will also be correlated .",
    "the choice of cosmological model to test , which acts as a prior on the measurements also acts to correlate the measured parameters .",
    "in fact , as we show in this paper , these two effects are strongly coupled : the importance of the measurement correlation depends on the model to be tested . consequently it is important when making predictions for future surveys to clearly set out the cosmological model selection .",
    "for example , rsd are often parametrised by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bias , @xmath11 is the rms amplitude of fluctuations in the matter field in spheres of radius @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the linear growth function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    ", where @xmath15 is a @xmath16 mode of matter overdensity and @xmath17 is a scale factor at arbitrary time @xmath18 of normalization .",
    "@xmath14 is a scale - independent function of redshift only on large scales in gr , but is also a function of @xmath16 on small scales and in modified theories of gravity . ] in fact , this dependence follows from certain assumptions about the universe , which also affect the geometrical constraints ( see section  [ sec : survey_measurements ] ) .",
    "it is therefore unphysical to make assumptions for one measurement but not for the other . in this paper",
    "we consider how the choice of model affects the coupling between geometrical constraints and rsd , moving from simple assumptions about the universe to specific parametrizations of different models .    in order to demonstrate these effects",
    "we predict measurements that could result from a possible survey configuration undertaken by the _",
    "euclid _ satellite .",
    "we use the baseline parameters for this survey considered by the _",
    "assessment team , which we briefly describe in section  [ sec : euclid ] . in section  [ sec : survey_measurements ] we review the measurements that can be made from galaxy surveys , and the fisher matrix formalism by which predictions are usually made for galaxy surveys is introduced in section  [ sec : fisher ] .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] discusses the models and how they affect the power spectrum .",
    "we show how the choice of model strongly affects predictions in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in sec .",
    "in order to consider the ( often hidden ) effect of the cosmological model assumption on ap and rsd measurements , we consider the baseline _ euclid _ spectroscopic galaxy survey as outlined in the _ euclid _ assessment study report @xcite . _ euclid _ is a proposed mission to study dark energy through an imaging survey of galaxy shapes , exploiting galaxy weak lensing and a spectroscopic survey of galaxy redshifts exploiting the bao technique for measuring cosmological evolution . in this paper",
    "we only consider the cosmological information available from the spectroscopic component of the mission .",
    "_ euclid _ is currently in the definition phase with possible launch date of 2017 . while these parameters can be treated as representative for a possible survey that could be provided by the _",
    "experiment , the baseline is expected to evolve as the definition phase progresses and consequently these numbers may not match the final survey achievable by this experiment .",
    "we assume that _ euclid _ will provide a galaxy redshift survey over a 20000deg@xmath1 sky area , and will measure redshifts for emission line galaxies over the redshift range @xmath19 with the precision of @xmath20 .",
    "the number density of galaxies follows the assumption that we can obtain redshifts for 50% of galaxies with h-@xmath21 emission stronger than @xmath22ergs@xmath23@xmath24 , following the number density distribution described in @xcite . these galaxies are biased tracers of the mass distribution , and we adopt the redshift dependent bias relations of @xcite .",
    "we fit to the power spectrum over wavenumbers @xmath25 for bins with @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    ", we cut this maximum scale approximately linearly to only fit to scales @xmath28 at @xmath29 to match the increasing scale of non - linear structure at low redshift @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of different survey parameters to the ability of constrain cosmological models parameters will be studied in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will only consider cosmological measurements resulting from using rsd and from using galaxy clustering as a standard ruler .",
    "we do not consider additional constraints from the relative clustering amplitude on small and large scales .",
    "if the galaxy separation is small compared with the distance to the galaxies , overdensities and velocities are small , the galaxy velocity field is irrotational , and the continuity equation holds , then we can write the redshift - space overdensity as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the divergence of the velocity field , and @xmath32 is the cosine of the angle between wavevector @xmath33 and the line - of - sight @xcite . in this case",
    "the redshift - space power spectrum @xmath34 consists of three components @xmath35 where a subscript @xmath36 refers to the galaxies and a subscript @xmath37 refers to the velocity divergence .",
    "the power spectra can be directly related if we can assume that the linearised euler , continuity and poisson equations hold in a perturbed frw universe , and we can write @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth factor @xmath14 .",
    "the three power spectra now have the same shape , and there are now only two free parameters , which can be chosen to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , giving the amplitudes ( rms in spheres of radius @xmath12 ) of the real - space galaxy overdensity field and velocity divergence field .",
    "we therefore see that , in order to write the rsd dependency in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we have already had to assume that the universe follows a frw model . using @xmath40 and @xmath10 as parameters ,",
    "the measured redshift - space galaxy - galaxy power spectrum is traditionally related to the real space matter power spectrum through @xmath41    hereafter , for simplicity and without loss of generality , we drop @xmath11 from the rsd parameters , although it should be remembered that the constraints are dependent on the amplitude of the matter overdensity field .",
    "if we drop the assumption of a frw model , then we can still try to constrain these parameters , but eq .  ( [ eq : rsd ] ) no longer holds . eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsd ] ) also assumes that we know the cosmological geometry in order to estimate galaxy separations . obviously we can not make this assumption as we wish to measure both the rsd and the cosmological geometry from the measured power spectrum .    in all subsequent computations",
    "we will use linear kaiser formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsd ] ) to model rsd on large scales and we will also assume that bias is not a function of @xmath16 .",
    "numerical simulations show that both these assumptions are approximations even on very large scales ; linear rsd theory does not agree with simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galaxy bias displays scale dependence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even on the scales of @xmath5 .",
    "we presume that using linear theory as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsd ] ) still gives accurate estimate of the fisher matrix for the galaxy survey , even though when analysing real data the nonlinear effects in rsd and bias must be dealt with properly .",
    "we only consider galaxy clustering on radial scales that are sufficiently small that there is negligible cosmological evolution across them . in this case ,",
    "an angular standard ruler measures @xmath42 , and a radial standard ruler measures @xmath43 , where @xmath6 is the ( comoving ) angular diameter distance , @xmath44 is the derivative of the radial distance , and @xmath45 is the scale of the ruler . for bao",
    ", this scale corresponds to the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch .",
    "if , on the other hand , we use the full correlation function or power spectrum as our ruler , this corresponds to the average scale of the features .",
    "forcing the observed ruler to be the same size in radial and angular directions gives the alcock - palczynski test @xcite . in order to simplify the equations we drop the explicit dependence on @xmath45 and consider that the geometry only depends on @xmath46 and @xmath47 : it is worth remembering that errors presented for these parameters are actually errors on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "to analyse galaxy clustering data we have to adopt a fiducial cosmological model .",
    "the angular and radial distances in our fiducial model will be different from real distances by the factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 where quantities without a hat are computed in a fiducial model and hat denotes real value . and @xmath52 in previous literature . here",
    "we change the symbols to @xmath53 and @xmath54 to avoid unnecessary confusion with the growth rate @xmath40 . ]",

    "the galaxy power - spectrum is scaled by the additional factor @xmath58 because the reference cosmology under(over)estimates the survey volume by the factor of @xmath59 .",

    "however , the importance of this degeneracy is tightly coupled with the degree of freedom allowed in the models to be tested .",
    "we have argued that a consistent approach needs to be adopted - any assumptions that are required to model the rsd should also be applied to the standard ruler measurements and vice - versa .",
    "one of the most important assumptions for the rsd follows from the assumption of a frw cosmology : if a frw model is assumed when analysing structure growth then , logically , it should also be assumed when analysing the geometry .",
    "care must also be taken when making predictions for future surveys to consider how a survey will actually be analysed .",
    "perhaps the best procedure for how to test and constrain different cosmological models comes from the wmap team ( e.g. @xcite ) , who first fitted the `` simple '' @xmath0cdm model , and then looked for deviations from this .",
    "there is a strong argument that future galaxy surveys , such as those made possible by the _",
    "satellite should be analysed using a similar methodology . in this paper",
    ", we have argued that looking for deviations around the baseline assumption of a @xmath0cdm model greatly reduces the effect of the degeneracy between rsd and the ap effect . as the model is relaxed and more parameters are introduced ,",
    "then the degeneracy does become more important for specific parameters .",
    "i.e. we can fit and constrain the @xmath0cdm model to a high degree of accuracy , and we can find deviations around this model , but degeneracies mean that we can not then tell how or why such deviations exist if we include too many degrees of freedom .",
    "a parameter fit can be considered either as a measurement , or as a consistency check : for example , fitting the data with a @xmath0cdm model with the @xmath111 model for structure growth can be considered a test of general relativity : we can test whether @xmath145 . however , as we have seen , such tests based on the galaxy survey data are coupled with tests of the geometrical model . in effect , this changes the sensitivity to deviations from the cosmological standard model to different directions . changing the figure of merit to be based on different parameters will simply change the sensitivity direction .",
    "this could be chosen based on how measurements are made ( as in @xcite ) , or based on theoretical prejudice . here",
    "we argue that , rather than changing the fom , we should simply consider the most likely way in which the data will be analysed .",
    "it seem unlikely that we will only look for deviations by changing both the dark energy equation of state ( e.g. moving to a wcdm model ) , and simultaneously allowing growth of structure to vary ( e.g. moving to a @xmath111 model for structure growth ) .",
    "instead we will look for deviations around the @xmath0cdm model in particular directions and in combination .",
    "we provide a c - program available at http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/~samushil/downloads/fish4d that makes use of publicly available gsl library , to compute a fisher matrix and expected errors on @xmath9 and other cosmological parameters .",
    "this should enable our results to be checked , and constraints from both geometry and rsd to be jointly predicted for any future survey .",
