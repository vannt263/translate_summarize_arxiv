    "the three methods employed in this work suggest that the internal rotation profile of  is differential , with the central regions rotating more than twice faster than stellar surface .",
    "rigid body rotation can be discarded for this star at a level of confidence of more than @xmath180 and @xmath181 when we consider uncertainties in the observed frequency separations of @xmath182 and @xmath183hz , respectively . by averaging our results according to the three method employed",
    ", we estimate that the core to surface rotation ratio is @xmath184 .    up to now , only our sun ( schou et al . 1998 ) and two pulsating @xmath185 cephei stars  hd 129929 ( dupret et al . 2004 ) and @xmath186 eridani ( pamyatnykh et al . 2004 ) ",
    "are known to be rotating differentially with depth .",
    "our results for   can be considered as the first asteroseismic evidence of differential rotation with depth for an evolved star .",
    "finally , the fact that the internal rotation profile of the prototypical star , which is rotating as a rigid body , is apparently very different than that obtained here for   could be indicative that pg1159 stars are the result of different evolutionary channels and different mass - loss histories , as suggested by recent theoretical evidence ( althaus et al .",
    "our results call for the need of similar analysis for other well studied gw vir stars .",
