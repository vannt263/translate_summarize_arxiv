    "l723 is an isolated molecular cloud located at a distance of @xmath5  pc @xcite and with a systemic velocity of @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it harbors a low  mass , class 0 , young stellar object , first identified by the iras satellite , iras 19156 + 1906 @xcite , with a bolometric luminosity of 3.4  l@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the properties of the protostar in the ir to mm wavelength range have been object of several studies @xcite .",
    "iras 19156 + 1906 is associated with a co outflow with a quadrupolar morphology @xcite .",
    "this outflow consists of a pair of bipolar lobes aligned along the east  west direction ( position angle @xmath9 ) and another pair of bipolar lobes aligned roughly in the north - south direction ( @xmath10 ) , with iras 19156 + 1906 located at their common center @xcite .",
    "the east  west ( ew ) pair of lobes , and in particular the blueshifted , eastern lobe , is associated with several herbig - haro ( hh ) objects @xcite",
    ". very large array ( vla ) observations at 3.6  cm reveal two sources , vla  1 and vla  2 , toward the center of outflow @xcite , although vla  1 is likely a background source @xcite .",
    "vla  2 shows the characteristics of a thermal radio - jet ( jet  like morphology and partially optically thick free - free emission ) , and was first identified as the powering source of the ew pair of molecular lobes @xcite .",
    "recent , very sensitive , sub - arcsecond angular resolution ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) vla observations at 3.6 cm and 7 mm resolve vla 2 into several components .",
    "the two brightest sources at 3.6  cm , vla  2a and 2b , are separated by @xmath13 ( 90 au in projection ) and are possibly tracing embedded protostars @xcite .",
    "vla  2a is associated with extended emission along a @xmath14 .",
    "two additional sources , believed to also trace embedded protostars are identified at 7  mm : vla  2c , located at the position of the water maser emission @xcite , and vla  2d , located @xmath15 southeast of vla  2a .",
    "@xcite suggest that the co high velocity emission and the hh objects are tracing three different outflows .",
    "one of them is the ns outflow possibly powered by vla  2b .",
    "the other two are what previously was considered as the ew pair of lobes : one of the outflows has a @xmath16 and is powered by vla  2a , whereas the other one seems to be a `` fossil '' outflow with a @xmath17 .",
    "high angular resolution ( 35 ) vla observations of l723 carried out by @xcite , show that the nh@xmath18  emission arises from a v - shaped structure that traces the dense molecular envelope around the embedded protostars .",
    "this structure is elongated roughly east - west and is 0.15  pc long , with a mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the ammonia maps show evidence of heating and line broadening toward vla 2 . a second spot of heating",
    "is observed @xmath20 west of vla 2 .",
    "this western hot spot ( whs here after ) is interpreted by @xcite as a very young protostar with and age shorter than @xmath21  yr . the nh@xmath18structure is only partially traced by cs and n@xmath0h@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the dense envelope of l723 was also observed at sub - millimeter wavelengths ( @xmath23 m and @xmath24 m ) by @xcite and @xcite using the continuum scuba camera of the jcmt .",
    "a strong millimeter source was found , peaking at the position of vla 2 , with a large extension that matches the high - density gas traced by nh@xmath18 .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the molecular and dust emission at scales of @xmath25  au around the low  mass star forming region of l723 . in   2 we describe the observational procedure with the sma . in ",
    "3 we describe the main results obtained with the sma data . in   4 we present an analysis of the dust and h@xmath0co  emission . in   5",
    "we discuss the possible evolutionary scenarios of the sources in the region .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 8antenna sma array at mauna kea at 1.3 millimeters in 2004 august ( compact configuration ) .",
    "the phase center was set at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the phase calibrator used was qso 1925@xmath28211 , and qso 1749@xmath28096 was used as a reference calibrator",
    ". absolute flux and bandpass calibration was done by observing uranus and jupiter , respectively .",
    "the sma correlator has a bandwidth of 2  ghz with 24 partially overlapping windows ( chunks ) of 104  mhz .",
    "all the chunks had 128 channels , except the second chunk which was configured to have 512 channels .",
    "the correlator was setup to observe the h@xmath0co   line in the second chunk of the lower side band .",
    "maps were made with the @xmath29 data weighted by the associated system temperatures and using a robust weighting of 0.0 ( continuum data ) , 0.5 ( h@xmath0co ) and 1 ( other line data ) .",
    "table  [ tobserva ] lists the basic information about the resulting maps , including the frequency of the lines or continuum , the channel resolution ( for line observations ) , the resulting synthesized beam and the @xmath30 noise of the maps .",
    "the 1.35  mm continuum map shows that the emission is clearly resolved into two components , l723 sma 1 and sma 2 , with similar intensities ( see figure  [ fdust ] ) and separated by @xmath1 ( 880 au in projected distance ) with a position angle of @xmath31 .",
    "these two components were previously detected by @xcite at 3  mm .",
    "the strongest component , sma  2 , is associated with vla 2a , 2b and 2c , 3.6  cm and 7  mm continuum sources that are probably young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "the other component , sma  1 , is only detected at 3  mm @xcite and marginally at 7  mm ( source vla 2d : carrasco et al . 2008 ) and does not have known counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "table  [ tdust ] gives the values of position , intensity , flux densities and the deconvolved sizes for both mm sources obtained by fitting a gaussian to each component .",
    "the two sources are partially resolved at scales of about @xmath32@xmath33 ( 300600  au ) .",
    "naturally weighted maps were obtained in order to better estimate the total flux of the double core and to try to detect the whs .",
    "the total flux density detected by our observations for sma  2 and sma  1 is @xmath34  mjy , which is 22  mjy higher ( @xmath3520% ) than that from the map shown in figure  [ fdust ] , obtained with a robust weight of 0 .",
    "this excess is possibly due to the better sensitivity of the natural weighted map to weak and extended emission .",
    "no emission is detected with the sma at the position of whs , with a 3-@xmath36 upper limit of 4.2  mjy  beam@xmath7 .",
    "gaussian tapers were applied to the visibilities to increase the beam size and see if the whs could be detected , which yielded negative results .",
    "the mass of the circumstellar material traced by the dust emission at mm wavelength , where it is optically thin is : @xmath37 with @xmath38 the gas  to  dust ratio , @xmath39 the distance , @xmath40 the flux density , @xmath41 the dust mass opacity coefficient and @xmath42 the planck function for a blackbody of dust temperature @xmath43 .",
    "the major source of uncertainty in the mass derivation is the poor knowledge of the distance ( @xmath44  pc ) . to derive the mass we adopted @xmath45 @xcite , a dust mass opacity of @xmath46  @xmath47  g@xmath7 @xcite . to estimate the temperature of the dust",
    ", we used the vla nh@xmath48 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) maps from @xcite , which have a slightly higher angular resolution ( @xmath49 ) than the sma maps . following the standard analysis procedure for these two ammonia lines",
    ", we obtain that at the sma  1 , sma  2 and whs peak positions the ammonia rotation temperature is @xmath50  k , which converted to the gas kinetic temperature of the gas is @xmath51  k @xcite",
    ". table  [ tmass ] gives the mass derived for the different components using this value for the dust temperature .",
    "the total mass of the emission detected by the sma is @xmath52  @xmath53 , which is only a small fraction , @xmath54% , of the dense envelope detected at larger scales @xcite .",
    "whs has a very small mass , @xmath55  @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fform ] shows the channel maps for the h@xmath0co  line .",
    "the h@xmath0co  emission is concentrated around the two mm continuum sources , sma  1 and sma  2 , although in most of the channels sma  2 has brighter h@xmath0coemission than sma  1 . toward sma  2 the h@xmath0co  emission peaks at or very close to the dust emission peak , whereas around sma  1 the peak emission is , in some channels , displaced to the se ( only at @xmath56  km  s@xmath7  the h@xmath0co  peaks at the same position as the dust ) .",
    "the kinematics of the two sources is difficult to disentangle because their separation is similar to the angular resolution .",
    "the first order moment of the emission shows velocity gradients along the two cores with velocity shifts up to @xmath57  km  s@xmath7 . although there is not a clear simple trend , the emission east of sma  1 is clearly blueshifted with respect to the rest of the region .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the h@xmath0co  emission ( second - order moment map : see fig .",
    "[ fmom ] ) changes little around the two cores , with values within the range of 0.5 to 0.7  km  s@xmath7 , which corresponds , for a gaussian line , to a full width at half maximum of 1.2 to 1.7  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this velocity dispersion range is larger than the one measured from vla nh@xmath18 observations , @xmath58  km  s@xmath7@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fespectra ] shows that the spectra of h@xmath0cohas larger line widths that those of nh@xmath18  ( note that the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions have hyperfine components , which broadens the line , specially for the ( 1,1 ) ) .",
    "since vla  2 is a thermal radio jet with a well defined orientation @xcite , position - velocity ( pv ) plots along ( @xmath59 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath60 ) to the radio jet orientation were made crossing vla  2 , which lies at the peak of sma  2 ( figure  [ fpv ] ) .",
    "the pv plot along the radio jet direction passes very close to sma  1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fpv ] ) . in the direction perpendicular to the jet , the h@xmath0co  shows a velocity gradient ( @xmath61  km  s@xmath7  within @xmath62 around vla  2 ) that could be indicative of rotation . in the direction along the radio jet",
    "there is overlap of the emission between sma  2 and sma  1 .",
    "nevertheless , at the position of sma  1 the h@xmath0co  emission shows a relative minimum . in figure  [ fpv ]",
    "we also show the pv plot centered on sma  1 with a position angle of @xmath63 , nearly perpendicular to the pv along the vla  2 radio jet direction .",
    "this pv plot shows two weak peaks at different velocities , @xmath64@xmath65 and 11.9  km  s@xmath7 , that are slightly shifted in position ( @xmath66 ) .    as in the case of the continuum emission ,",
    "no emission is detected at the position of the ammonia whs ( see fig .  [ fespectra ] ) .",
    "the 3-@xmath36 upper limit from the sma map is 0.53  jy  beam@xmath7   ( 2.4  k ) .      the sio  line is marginally detected towards the sma  1 and sma  2 system ( see figure  [ fsio ] ) .",
    "the emission appears clumpy and elongated in the nw - se direction ( @xmath67 ) , with the strongest emission about @xmath68 se of sma  1 .",
    "taking into account the fact that the sio is a tracer of molecular shocks , the emission appears relatively `` quiescent '' : it is only slightly redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity ( the emission is detected in the @xmath69 and 12.44  km  s@xmath7  channels ) and the line - width , @xmath70  km  s@xmath7 , is only slightly larger than that of the lines tracing the dense circumstellar material such as h@xmath0co  and ammonia .",
    "the emission is apparently more associated with sma  1 , but given the complex outflow activity in the region @xcite it is difficult to elucidate with which outflow and powering source it is associated .",
    "nevertheless , at the sio velocity and location there is strong co emission ( see channel maps from lee et a. 2002 ) , which suggests that the sio is tracing a region of interaction between the dense envelope and the outflow @xcite .",
    "several hyperfine transitions of the cn rotational transition were detected ( fig .",
    "[ fespe ] ) .",
    "the strongest line is a blend of three hyperfine lines , the @xmath71= ,  and  of the @xmath72= set .",
    "the @xmath72= , @xmath71=  hyperfine line is also marginally detected .",
    "although there are other hyperfine transitions within the bandwidth their relative intensities were too small to be detected ( see fig .",
    "[ fespe ] ) .",
    "the integrated intensity of the detected transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fmol ] ) shows that the emission is concentrated around vla  2 , being only weakly detected towards sma  1 .",
    "we also marginally detected the dcn  line toward the two sources ( figs .",
    "[ fmol ] and [ fespe ] ) . despite the poor spectral resolution ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath7 ) , these two molecules show emission at the ambient molecular gas velocity with narrow line widths ( @xmath73  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the dust emission from sma  1 and sma  2 are partially resolved with sizes of several hundred au , which suggest that a significant contribution to the emission is possibly coming from the infalling envelopes around the disks .",
    "figure  [ uvplot ] shows clearly that the correlated amplitude in the visibility data centered on vla  2 comes mostly from an extended component , although there is also a weaker unresolved component , with a flux density of @xmath74  mjy , that appears to be dominant at visibility radii larger than @xmath75  k@xmath76 . to better characterize this apparently compact component ,",
    "additional maps were obtained using only visibilities that have a radius in the @xmath29 plane larger than 45  k@xmath76 .",
    "the resulting map of the emission from sma  1 and sma  2 appears to be compact .",
    "both sources are unresolved with fluxes of @xmath77 and @xmath78  mjy for sma  2 and sma  1 , respectively .",
    "this is about one third of the total flux density detected by the sma for each source . a gaussian fit to sma  2 using the task imfit of aips yields an upper limit of the diameter of @xmath79 : the other source , sma  1 , is too weak to do the same fitting . in any case , the compact dusty components seem to arise from a structure with a radius of @xmath80  au . without proper modeling",
    "it is not possible to elucidate whether this compact component traces the disk or the inner part of the envelope .",
    "interestingly , the peaks of the two components are slightly shifted ( @xmath81 ) with respect to the peak position given in table  [ tdust ] .",
    "this could be produced by a somewhat asymmetrical distribution of the gas and dust in the envelope , which will not be a surprise because of the multiplicity detected with the vla at the center of sma  2 .",
    "the compact component of sma  2 coincides well with the centimeter source vla  2a detected by @xcite ( the position of the dust is @xmath82(j2000)@xmath83 and @xmath84(j2000)@xmath85 ) .",
    "the peak of the sma  1 compact component ( @xmath82(j2000)@xmath86 and @xmath84(j2000)@xmath87 ) is displaced to the northwest with respect to vla  2d by @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fdust4 ] ) . given the weak detection of this source at both 1.35 and 7 mm ( 5 and 4-@xmath36 respectively ) further more sensitive observations are needed to confirm this displacement .    in order to characterize the properties of the double cores we modeled the dust emission assuming , for simplicity , that it arises from two independent optically  thin twin circumstellar envelopes with a radial density and temperature profiles at the position of the dusty sources detected with the sma .",
    "the model integrates the dust emission assuming spherical symmetry from an inner radius , @xmath89 , to an outer radius of @xmath90  au ( this value is somewhat arbitrary and does not affect the fit because the emission at these scales is filtered out by the sma ) . we do not include the possible contribution from the circumstellar disks , since it is possible that at this stage the disks are small , with a radius of @xmath91  au , @xcite .",
    "the three possible protostars associated with sma  2 are separated by a projected distance of @xmath92 or 270  au @xcite , below the angular resolution of our observations . if these sources are truly nearby protostars , it is possible that there is a cavity in the envelope between these sources . to check whether there is a significant cavity , we used different radii of 30 , 100 and 180  au",
    "we adopted the density profile expected for an infalling envelope , @xmath93 , up to an infall radius , @xmath94 .",
    "beyond @xmath94 we used a @xmath95 density profile . in order to minimize the free parameters in the model",
    ", we adopted a @xmath96  au , the value found by @xcite .",
    "for a dusty cloud heated by an internal source , the temperature radial profile can be characterized as @xmath97 @xcite , where @xmath98 is the dust emissivity spectral index .",
    "the value used is @xmath99 , which was derived from 850 and 450  @xmath100 m scuba observations @xcite .",
    "we adopted an 1.35  mm dust opacity of @xmath101  @xmath47 , which should be adequate for dusty particles with ice mantles at densities of about 10@xmath102  @xmath103  according to @xcite .",
    "additional free parameters were the density @xmath104 and temperature @xmath105 at a radius of 1,000  au .",
    "intensity profiles were obtained for each set of @xmath89 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 and converted to a 2-d image map .",
    "these modeled maps were multiplied by the primary beam response of the sma antennae , assumed to be @xmath106 at 1.35  mm .",
    "two sets of visibility data were generated : one obtained by subtracting the modeled map to the visibility continuum data of the sma observations .",
    "the other set was obtained by replacing the values of observed visibilities with the values expected from the modeled map .",
    "maps of the residual and of the model were obtained from the visibilities using the same parameters as the sma maps shown here .",
    "the _ rms _ and _ bias _ was finally computed for these residual maps .",
    "the bias is defined as the absolute flux density of the residual on a given region ( the region where the emission is detected ) .",
    "the models with an inner radius of 180  au can not reproduce well the sma data , which suggests that if there is an inner cavity ( produced by the presence of a multiple protostellar system ) , it is not big enough to affect the simple model used here . with respect to the solutions with an inner radius of 30 and 100  au , there is , for both , a family of possible solutions in the @xmath105@xmath104 plane .",
    "the plot of the _ rms _ for these two inner radii in the range of densities and temperatures computed are shown in figure  [ fresidumodel ] .",
    "the best set of solutions can be expressed as @xmath107 @xmath108^{-1.2}$ ]  @xmath103  and @xmath109^{-1.2}$ ]  @xmath103  for the 30 and 100  au inner radius , respectively .",
    "the vla ammonia maps from @xcite can be used to further constrain the model . at the positions of sma  1 and sma  2 the kinetic temperature estimated from the nh@xmath18  ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) maps is @xmath110",
    "k ( see   [ resultdust ] ) .",
    "since the beam of the vla maps is @xmath111 , it is reasonable to adopt the value of @xmath112 or 520  au , as the radius at which the gas is at 25  k. this implies that the temperature profile of the dust can be written as @xmath113  k. the previous two equations that give the best set of solutions yield a density profile of @xmath114 @xmath115  @xmath103for @xmath116  au , and of @xmath117  @xmath103   for @xmath118  au .",
    "figure  [ uvplot ] shows that the correlated flux in the visibility domain for the model with @xmath119  au , @xmath120  k and @xmath121  @xmath103  fits reasonably well the sma data . the synthetic maps from the model and from the residuals for this particular solution also show the remarkable similitude with the l723 dusty binary system ( see fig .  [ fmapmodel ] ) .",
    "indeed , from the residual map obtained using only the longest baselines ( see right panels of fig .",
    "[ fmapmodel ] ) the model of the binary envelope can account within the @xmath30 level of the map the compact , apparently unresolved , component of the two dusty sources , without the need of invoking the presence of an accretion disk ( see the discussion section ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the residual map done using all the visibilities shows some significant residuals ( at a @xmath122-@xmath36 level ) : there are some positive residuals northeast of sma  2 and extended negatives on the southern side of the dust emission from both sma  1 and sma  2",
    ". these residuals could be due to the departure from the spherical symmetry of the data .",
    "we can also compare the density we found with the value derived by @xcite by modeling the spectral energy distribution of l723 .",
    "they estimated that at 100 au the density is @xmath123  @xmath103 , which is a factor 2.6 to 3.4 lower than what we derive for @xmath120  k. this difference could be due to the different dust opacity and the different density profile used .",
    "the derived density distribution can be used to estimate the mass of the two envelopes .",
    "the equivalent radius of the sma shortest baselines in the visibility domain ( @xmath124  k@xmath76 ) is @xmath125 ( 1125  au ) .",
    "the combined mass for the two envelope within a radius of 1125  au is in the 0.140.36  @xmath53  range for a temperature range of @xmath12030  k and of @xmath119100  au .",
    "these values are compatible with the mass estimated in table  [ tmass ] .    as an additional test for the model",
    ", we have used a 3.2  mm continuum map obtained with the bima array .",
    "these observations were carried out in september 2003 in the c configuration . the continuum was observed simultaneously with the n@xmath0h@xmath22 10 and ch@xmath18oh @xmath126@xmath127  a and @xmath128@xmath129  e lines ( masqu , girart & estalella , in preparation ) .",
    "the dust model was extrapolated to this wavelength , and the standard position of the bima antennas at the c configuration were used to create a synthetic bima map using the same procedure as the one described for the sma .",
    "the synthetic maps were obtained for the @xmath116  au , @xmath120  k and @xmath121  @xmath103  model .",
    "figure  [ fbimamodel ] shows that the model also reproduces reasonably well the bima map .",
    "once the dust emission was successfully modeled , we modeled the h@xmath0coemission using the one dimensional version of ratran @xcite .",
    "this is a monte carlo code that calculates the radiative transfer and excitation of molecular lines .",
    "the code is formulated from the viewpoint of cells rather than photons , which allows the separation of local and external contributions of the radiation field .",
    "this gives an accurate and fast performance even for high opacities @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0co   collisional rates used were derived by @xcite and were downloaded from the leiden atomic and molecular database @xcite .",
    "we modeled the emission as arising from two cores with the same density and temperature profile , as suggested by the dust modeling .",
    "since there is a family of possible solutions , we fixed the temperature and density profiles derived in the previous section that agrees with the ammonia rotational temperature : @xmath113  k and @xmath130  @xmath103(the solution for @xmath131  au ) .",
    "the kinematics is not well resolved with our observations , so we assume that the gas is in free - fall collapse .",
    "this is marginally suggested by the line profile at the position of sma  1 and sma  2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fmodel2 ] and   [ stwin ] ) .",
    "we adopted a velocity field for the free - falling gas of @xmath132  km  s@xmath7   and an intrinsic linewidth of 0.6  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "using these values the modeled line width was similar to the h@xmath0co  values measured with the sma and , in any case , the use of these values should not affect critically the derivation of the h@xmath0co  properties @xcite .    to run",
    "ratran we adopted a fixed h@xmath0co  abundance within a shell with an inner and outer radius @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , with the abundance being zero outside the shell .",

    "abundance , @xmath135p  h@xmath0co@xmath136 $ ] . since the h@xmath0co  emission is significantly different between the two envelopes , we made synthesized maps using different sets of ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135p  h@xmath0co@xmath136 $ ] ) values for sma  1 and sma  2 .",
    "synthesized maps with 16 channels and with a spectral resolution of 0.28  km  s@xmath7  were generated .",
    "we took into account that the systemic velocity of the h@xmath0co  between the two cores differs by @xmath137  km  s@xmath7  ( see table  [ tform ] ) .",
    "the maps were multiplied by the primary beam of the sma and then converted to visibilities .",
    "maps of the model and of the residuals ( generated by subtracting the model to the data in the visibility domain ) were made in the same fashion as for the sma dust emission maps ( see   [ modeldust ] ) .",

    "in order to find the best set of solutions , we computed separately the @xmath141 parameter for the spectra at the sma  1 and sma  2 positions and for the total flux density within a region of @xmath142 centered around the twin envelopes .",
    "table  [ tratran ] shows the range of the best fits found .",
    "the range of parameters is better constrained for sma  2 than for sma  1 .",
    "this is due to its higher intensity and its apparently more compact size .",
    "indeed , the model yields solutions that imply that the h@xmath0co  around sma  2 should arise from the inner region of the envelope . more specifically , the outer radius can not be significantly larger than 600 au , but not lower than 300  au ( otherwise the emission would be unresolved , which is not the case ) .",
    "the sma  2 abundance is also relatively well constrained , @xmath135p  h@xmath0co@xmath136\\simeq(3$]@xmath143 . for sma  1 , the best set of solution yields h@xmath0co  abundances in the range @xmath135p  h@xmath0co@xmath136\\simeq(8$]@xmath144 , but with values always lower than for sma  2 :",
    "the best solutions are found when sma  2 abundances are a factor of 3 to 10 higher than for sma  1 .",
    "another difference with respect to sma  2 is that the best models for sma  1 have a larger outer radius than for sma  2 , @xmath1455000 au .",
    "figure  [ fmodel1 ] shows the synthesized model , the sma data and the residual for one of the best solutions found ( see the figure caption for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fmodel2 ] shows the spectra toward sma  1 and sma  2 for the same model and for the sma data .",
    "these figures show that the models fit the observations reasonably well , although the residuals appear up to about a 4-@xmath36 level . in spite of the good match between the synthesized and observed spectra for the two sources ,",
    "the model reproduces better the morphology of sma  2 than that of sma  1 .",
    "the morphology mismatch between sma  1 and the synthesized map occurs for all the models .",
    "this suggest that the emission , specially from sma  1 , departs from the idealized spherical model used with the assumption that the h@xmath0co  arises only within a shell . indeed ,",
    "the position ",
    "velocity cuts in two orthogonal directions centered on sma  1 ( see fig .  [ fpv ] ) show a double peak in one of them and what roughly appear to partially be a `` donut '' , centered on sma  1 , in the other cut ( partially because of the overlap with sma  2 in the nw side ) .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath0co  emission may not come from the shell of a spherical envelope but from a contracting and somewhat flattened shell or torus .",
    "for example , such a case was more clearly observed in the cs emission associated with the dense core ahead of hh  80n @xcite .",
    "the marginal evidence that the h@xmath0co  arises from a torus supports the idea that the emission does not come from a spherical configuration .",
    "however , despite the limitations of the adopted approach , given the limited signal - to - noise ratio obtained and the use of only one transition , the results from the modeling should be regarded as a good first approximation to the properties of h@xmath0co  in these two cores .",
    "the derived p ",
    "abundances are compatible with the value found by @xcite , @xmath146 , from single - dish observations , and are also within the range of values found for the so  called outer part of the circumstellar envelopes associated with class 0 sources @xcite , which are defined as the region where temperatures are lower than @xmath147  k. in the inner region of the envelopes , where the temperature is @xmath148  k , the icy grain mantles evaporates and molecular abundances are expected to increase significantly : the h@xmath0co  reaches abundances between @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xcite . our model did not take into account this warm component .",
    "nevertheless , the reasonable solutions found in this paper imply that the total amount of h@xmath0co  in the inner warm region is not significant , despite the very high h@xmath0co  abundance expected .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for l723 , the warm region is very small due to its low total bolometric luminosity , 3.4  l@xmath8 ( the temperature of 100  k is reached at a radius of 10  au ) .",
    "the dust emission reveals two similar substructures , with sma  2 being only slightly more massive than sma  1 ( table  [ tdust ] ) .",
    "in fact , the modeling of the emission suggest that within the observational uncertainties ( sensitivity and angular resolution ) the dust properties of the two cores can be accounted as arising from `` identical '' twin cores",
    ". however , these twin cores have different molecular properties .",
    "the cn and h@xmath0co   emission is stronger in sma  2 than in sma  1 .",
    "in fact , the modeling carried out in ",
    "[ smodelform ] shows that the h@xmath0co  associated with sma  2 has a higher molecular abundance ( by a factor 310 ) and arises from a more compact region than in sma  1 . in both cores , the line width of the h@xmath0co  lines",
    "are clearly larger ( by up to 50% ) than those of nh@xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath0co emission is more compact than the nh@xmath18  emission , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "these two features taken together are a good indication of the presence of radial velocity gradients , with increasing velocity with decreasing radius to protostars .",
    "both infall and rotation velocities are expected to have this behavior .",
    "the presence of a blueshifted peak slightky higher than the redshifted one at the position of the two cores ( fig .",
    "[ fmodel2 ] ) is an additional marginal evidence of infall motions .",
    "previous observations find clear star formation signatures associated with the sma  2 core .",
    "first the presence of a well studied thermal radio jet , vla  2a , pinpoint the position of a protostar that is powering the east  west molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "vla high angular resolution observations reveal the presence of a water maser , and 7  mm and 3.6  cm sources ( vla 2b and 2c ) @xmath151 around vla  2a @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpret these as a young stellar system , which is forming in the 150  au vicinity ( in projected distance ) around vla 2a .",
    "in addition , they find that vla  2b may be powering the north - south molecular outflow .",
    "this stellar system is being formed inside the sma  2 core .",
    "in contrast , there are not known signs of outflow activity towards sma  1 , yet .",
    "there is only marginal dust emission detected at 7  mm , labeled as vla 2d @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study and analysis of sma  1 and sma  2 show that they have almost identical properties ( mass , and density and temperature distribution ) and that there is marginal evidence of infall motions in both .",
    "however , the h@xmath0co  abundance towards sma  2 is significantly higher than in sma  1 .",
    "since sma  2 shows clear outflow activity , in contrast with sma  1 , this suggests that sma  2 is more evolved ( due to a higher infall rate or because it is older ) . in any case",
    ", they are not `` identical '' twin cores but `` fraternal '' twin cores .",
    "the total mass derived from the sma observations is less than 10% of the whole dense core , derived from scuba jcmt observations at 850 and 450 @xmath100 m @xcite or from vla nh@xmath18  observations @xcite .",
    "that is , the mass accreting to the protostars ( or to the disks ) at scales of @xmath152  au is only a small part of the dense core . in addition , from the modeling we found that the dust emission detected by the sma at 1.35  mm seems to arise from the dense twin envelopes , sma 1 and sma 2 , and within the limits of our sensitivity there is no need to invoke to the presence of protostellar disks .",
    "that means that the contribution from the disks at 1.35  mm should not be higher than @xmath153  mjy ( the 5@xmath36 value of the continuum residual map of fig .",
    "[ fmapmodel ] ) . assuming that the disk has a temperature of 50 k , the upper limit of the disk mass is @xmath154  m@xmath8",
    ". this mass would be higher if the dust emission from the disk is not optically thin , but it would be lower if the temperature is higher . in any case , this suggests that the disk mass is less than 10% of the mass of each of the twin cores .",
    "thus , the large scale ( 0.1  pc ) molecular envelope traced by nh@xmath18  or scuba contain most of the mass or , in other words , it is still the major reservoir of mass to keep the star formation going on",
    ". therefore , l723 seems to be in a very early phase of star formation .",
    "it is clear that fragmentation is occurring at different levels .",
    "the @xmath155  pc scale molecular envelope has fragmented at the center and at scales of @xmath3  au into two cores , sma 1 and sma 2 . at the same time , at least one of these cores , sma  2 , has undergone additional fragmentation at scales of @xmath4au , forming a multiple stellar system .",
    "however , we note that within the uncertainties , the sma 2 can be modeled a single envelope down to a radius of 30 au .",
    "it is interesting to note that whatever is the fragmentation process that is acting in the different scales ( turbulence , the initial magnetic field and angular momentum configuration ) is occurring within a 0.1  pc dense envelope that appears to be very quiescent at scales of few thousands au outside its center according to the nh@xmath18  data @xcite : line widths of only @xmath156  km  s@xmath7   and small velocity gradients , of 3  km  s@xmath7  pc@xmath7 .",
    "we present continuum and line 1.35  mm high angular resolution observations ( @xmath157 ) carried out with the sma toward the low  mass protostellar region in the l723 dark cloud .",
    "we detected emission of the dust , the h@xmath0co   , dcn and sio  transitions , as well as a few lines of the cn transition .",
    "we performed a radiative transfer analysis of the dust emission as well as for the h@xmath0co  line in order to constrain the physical and chemical conditions of the two cores .",
    "the main results of the paper can be summarized as :    1 .",
    "the dust emission arises from two similar cores , sma  1 and sma  2 , separated by @xmath1 ( 880 au in projected distance ) and with masses of 0.06 and 0.08  m@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "they are partially resolved , with deconvolved sizes of @xmath35500  au .",
    "sma  2 is associated with vla  2 and water maser emission .",
    "we modeled the dust emission from the two cores assuming that the cores have a density and temperature radial distribution of the type : @xmath93 and @xmath158 .",
    "we found that within the uncertainty achieved , the two cores can be considered almost `` identical '' twins .",
    "the best set of solutions are those with a density and temperature that match the following expression : @xmath159^{1.2}$ ]  @xmath103   ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the density and temperature at a radius of 1000  au ) .",
    "the model shows that all the emission detected can arise from the cores , with possibly no evidence of contribution from the accretion disk , which yields an upper limit of the disk mass of @xmath160  m@xmath8 .",
    "the h@xmath0co  emission is concentrated around the two mm continuum sources , sma  1 and sma  2 , although the emission is brighter toward sma  2 .",
    "the kinematics of the two sources is difficult to disentangle because their separation is similar to the angular resolution .",
    "nevertheless , there is marginal evidence of infall motions in both sources ( double peak line , with brighter blueshifted component ) , of a velocity gradient around sma  2 indicative of rotation , and that the h@xmath0co  in sma  1 arises from a contracting and somewhat flattened structure .",
    "the linewidth of h@xmath0co  has values in the 1.21.7  km  s@xmath7  range , which is @xmath3550% larger than the values measures for the nh@xmath18  lines by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0co  emission was modeled adopting the density and temperature profile constrained by the dust emission .",
    "we used ratran assuming a fixed p ",
    "h@xmath0co  abundance within a shell with a inner and outer radius @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , being the abundance zero outside the shell .",
    "reasonable models were found for a p ",
    "abundance range of @xmath161@xmath143 and ( 8@xmath144 for sma  2 and sma  1 , respectively , but with the sma  1 abundance lower than for sma  2 by a factor 3 to 10 .",
    "the best models are those that have a more compact emission in sma  2 ( @xmath162600 au ) than in sma  1 ( @xmath1455000 au ) .",
    "h@xmath0co  abundances found are compatible with the value of the outer part of the circumstellar envelopes associated with class 0 sources .",
    "the total amount of h@xmath0co  in the inner warm region of the circumstellar envelopes ( where @xmath163  k ) is not significant , despite the very high h@xmath0co  abundance expected ( e.g. ; maret et al .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for l723 , the warm region is very small ( a radius of @xmath164  au ) due to its low total bolometric luminosity , 3.4  l@xmath8 .",
    "the dcn and cn lines arise from the same region than the dust and h@xmath0co .",
    "the cn emission peaks clearly toward sma  2 , whereas the dcn shows similar emission in sma  1 and in sma  2 .",
    "sio is detected marginally at slightly redshifted velocities around sma  1 and sma  2 , and is possibly tracing a region of interaction between the dense envelope and the outflow .",
    "the western hot spot ( whs ) , detected by @xcite from nh@xmath18observations as a spot of local heating , is not detected by the sma ( line and continuum ) observations .",
    "the non  detection of the 1.35  mm emission yields an upper limit of the whs mass of @xmath1650.01  m@xmath8 . 6 .",
    "the above results suggest that although sma  1 and sma  2 cores have almost identical physical properties ( density and temperature distribution ) , they are rather `` fraternal '' twin cores , with sma  2 being in a more evolved stage .",
    "thus , sma  2 is harboring an active multiple low ",
    "mass protostellar system ( vla  2a , 2b and 2c ) , powering at least one molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are not signs of outflow activity towards sma  1 .",

    "fragmentation is occurring at different levels at the center of the l723 dense molecular cloud : at scales of @xmath3  au the cloud has fragmented into two cores , sma 1 and sma 2 , and sma  2 has undergone additional fragmentation at scales of @xmath4au , forming a multiple stellar system @xcite . whatever is the fragmentation process that is acting at the different scales ( turbulence , the initial magnetic field and angular momentum configuration ) it is occurring within a 0.1  pc dense envelope that appears to be at larger scales .",
