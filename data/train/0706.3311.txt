    "blue straggler stars ( bsss ) are stars located above and blue - ward of the main sequence ( ms ) turn - off in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . they were first discovered in a globular cluster ( m3 , sandage 1953 ) , and are mainly observed in star clusters ( fusi pecci et al . 1992 ; ferraro et al .",

    "( 1991 ) and mateo , fischer & krzeminski ( 1995 ) first indicated the existence of a large number of stars brighter than the turn - off mass in the sextans dsph .",
    "mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that these stars might be ordinary ms stars substantially younger than the bulk of the other stars .",
    "bss candidates have been found in varying numbers in most dsphs , such as sculptor ( e.g. , hurley - keller , mateo & grebel 1999 ; monkiewicz et al .",
    "1999 ) , draco ( aparicio , carrera & martnez - delgado 2001 ; hereafter a01 ) and ursa minor ( carrera et al . 2002",
    "; hereafter c02 ) .    the issue of whether these stars are young or bsss has not been quantitatively addressed because there were not suitable models of bss formation with predictive power with which to compare the observations .",
    "this also means that our proper understanding of the star formation history of these ` predominantly old ' dsphs remains in doubt .",
    "has there actually been low - level star formation in the last 8@xmath010 gyr in these galaxies or can they really be considered ` fossil ' galaxies ?",
    "thus , in order to reconstruct the star formation history of dsphs , it is crucial to understand whether the observed bss candidates are true bsss rather than younger stars .",
    "a second unsolved question about bsss is their formation mechanism itself .",
    "bsss are believed to have been somehow refuelled with hydrogen after the ms phase . however , the refuelling mechanism is still unknown .",
    "it has been proposed ( mccrea 1964 ) that mass transfer in isolated binaries can lead to the formation of bsss . on the other hand",
    ", bsss could be the products of stellar collisions , occurring during ( or triggered by ) three- and four - body encounters ( davies , benz & hills 1994 ; sigurdsson , davies & bolte 1994 ; lombardi et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the first case ,",
    "i.e. mass - transfer bsss ( mt - bsss ) , bsss can form if binaries are allowed to quietly evolve until they start the mass - transfer phase .",
    "this implies that the local density should not be too high , otherwise gravitational interactions will perturb the mass transfer . in the second case ,",
    "i.e. collisionally born bsss ( col - bsss ) , the density must be sufficiently high to guarantee a short collision time - scale .    in globular clusters",
    "both processes might occur , as in the high - density core we find the perfect conditions for col - bss formation , while in the periphery mt - bsss can originate from isolated binary evolution . in some circumstances ,",
    "the features of the observed bss population can be explained only by invoking a joint contribution by these mechanisms ( leonard 1989 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1992 ; bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ; sills & bailyn 1999 ; hurley et al . 2001 ) .",
    "for example , in some globular clusters the bss radial distribution is bimodal ( ferraro et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ; zaggia et al .",
    "1997 ; ferraro et al . 2004",
    "; sabbi et al .",
    "2004 ) , with a central peak , a minimum at intermediate radii , and a further rise at the periphery .",
    "dynamical simulations by mapelli et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 , hereafter m04 , m06 , respectively ) showed that this bimodal distribution can be reproduced only by requiring the central bsss to be mainly col - bsss , and the peripheral bsss to be mt - bsss .",
    "also the luminosity function of bsss in some globular clusters ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ; sills & bailyn 1999 ; sills et al .",
    "2000 ; ferraro et al . 2003 ; monkman et al .",
    "2006 ) suggests the coexistence of col - bsss and mt - bsss . in dsphs",
    "the collisional formation of bsss should be impossible , as the central density of these galaxies never reaches sufficiently high values to allow stellar encounters .",
    "thus , we expect bsss in dsphs to be solely mt - bss type .",
    "in this paper we seek to quantify the potential bss population characteristics in dsphs and thereby learn more about bss formation and evolution , and also about the star formation history in dsphs .",
    "first of all , we check whether the main characteristics ( such as radial and luminosity distribution ) of bss candidates in dsphs are more consistent with those predicted by theoretical models of bsss , or if they are more similar to ms young stars . at the same time",
    ", we would like to test whether the proposed formation mechanisms for bsss also work in dsphs , i.e. whether the bss candidates in dwarf galaxies can be connected with mt - bsss .",
    "we focus on the bss population of two dsphs , ursa minor and draco ( see table  1 ) .",
    "these are among the faintest and most diffuse dwarfs in the local group ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 , hereafter ih95 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "they also appear to be among the most dark matter dominated objects we know about ( kleyna et al .",
    "2003 ; wilkinson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "ursa minor and draco are also among those dsphs of the local group where star formation appeared to cease early on ( @xmath1 gyr ago , see mateo 1998 ; hernandez , gilmore & valls - gabaud 2000 ; a01 ; c02 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "in both these galaxies a significant number of bss candidates have been detected ( a01 ; c02 ) .",
    "if the observed bss candidates in these two dsphs can be explained as young ms stars , the existence of bsss in dwarf galaxies can probably be safely rejected . however , if instead these stars do behave like authentic bsss , then ursa minor and draco should be really considered two fossil galaxies , where star formation indeed completely stopped many gyr ago . furthermore , by studying such diffuse systems we can also learn about the properties of bsss in a much less dense environment than a globular cluster .",
    "in section 2 we present the data on which our analysis is based . in section 3",
    "we discuss the observational features of bss candidates , with particular emphasis on the luminosity function and radial distribution characteristics . in section 4",
    "we describe our dynamical simulations and compare the results with observations .",
    "a comparison with previous work on bss candidates in dwarf galaxies and globular clusters , is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "the isaac newton telescope ( int ) wide field camera ( wfc ) is a mosaic of four 4k @xmath2 2k eev chips , offering a field of view of @xmath30.29 square degrees .",
    "it is mounted in the prime focus of the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope on la palma .",
    "the @xmath4-band ( harris filter ) and @xmath5-band ( sdss - like)wfcsur / technical / filters/ ] data extend beyond the tidal radius in both draco and ursa minor ( see the upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : spatial ] ) . they were taken as part of the int wide field survey ( mcmahon et al 2001 ) during 2002 with an average seeing of 1  arcsec and in generally photometric conditions .",
    "the images were processed in the standard way with the int wfc pipeline ( irwin & lewis 2001 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional instrumental signature removal includes provision for : non - linearity correction at the detector level ; bias and overscan correction prior to trimming to the active detector areas ; flatfielding ; and fringe removal in the @xmath5-band .",
    "catalogue generation follows the precepts outlined by irwin ( 1985 , 1996 ) and includes the facility to : automatically track any background variations on scales of typically  20 - 30 arcsec ; detect and deblend images or groups of images ; and parameterise the detected images to give various ( soft - edged ) aperture fluxes , position and shape measures .",
    "the generated catalogues start with an approximate world coordinate system ( wcs ) defined by the known telescope and camera properties ( e.g. wcs distortion model ) and are then progressively refined using all - sky astrometric catalogues [ e.g. united states naval observatory ( usno ) catalogue of astrometric standards , automated plate measuring machine ( apm ) catalogue , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) ] to give internal precision generally better than 0.1 arcsec and global external precision of  0.25 arcsec or better .",
    "these latter numbers are solely dependent on the accuracy of the astrometric catalogues used in the refinement .    all catalogues for all ccds for each pointing are then processed using the image shape parameters for morphological classification in the main categories : stellar ; non - stellar ; noise - like .",
    "a sampled curve - of - growth for each detected object is derived from a series of aperture flux measures as a function of radius . the classification",
    "is then based on comparing the curve - of - growth of the flux for each detected object with the well - defined curve - of - growth for the general stellar locus .",
    "this latter is a direct measure of the integral of the point spread function ( psf ) out to various radii and is independent of magnitude , if the data are properly linearised , and if saturated images are excluded . the average stellar locus on each detector is clearly defined and is used as the basis for a null hypothesis stellar test for use in classification .",
    "the curve - of - growth for stellar images is also used to automatically estimate frame - based aperture corrections for conversion to total flux .",
    "the photometric standards observed during the run ( mainly landolt 1992 and spectrophotometric standards ) are automatically located in a standards database and used to estimate the zero - point in each passband for every pointing containing any of these standards .",
    "the trend in the derived zero - points is then used to assign a photometric quality index for each night and also as a first pass estimate for the magnitude calibration for all the observations .",
    "various quality control plots are generated by the pipeline and these are used to monitor characteristics such as the seeing , the average stellar image ellipticity ( to measure trailing ) , the sky brightness and sky noise , the size of aperture correction for use with the optimal aperture flux estimates ( here optimal refers to the well - known property that soft - edged apertures of roughly the average seeing radius provide close to profile fit accuracy , e.g. naylor 1998 ) .",
    "the ` optimal ' catalogue fluxes for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 filters for each field are then combined to produce a single matched catalogue for each pointing and the overlaps between pointings are used to cross - calibrate all the catalogues to a common system with typical accuracy 1 - 2 per cent across the survey region .",
    "the final step is to produce a unique catalogue for the whole region by removing spatially coincident ( within 1 arcsec ) duplicates .    as a final stage",
    "the data are convertedwfcsur / technical / photom/ ] from the instrumental wfc @xmath4 and @xmath5 passbands to the johnson - cousins @xmath4,@xmath6 system to obtain the standard cmd shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] .      from these data we selected three different populations : bsss , red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "the last two populations are considered good tracers of the overall light from the galaxy , and we use them as a comparison for bss distributions . for all these populations we adopt more conservative selection criteria with respect to previous works ( see e.g. a01 ; c02 ; lee et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter l03 ) , in order to minimize the contamination by stars of different populations .",
    "the regions of the cmd we associate with bsss , rgb and hb stars are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] as boxes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in particular , for bsss we chose the @xmath4 and ( @xmath4-@xmath6 ) range to be ( i ) sufficiently above the turn - off , in order to avoid contamination from the ms , ( ii ) blue - ward of the rgb , avoiding not only contamination from these stars but especially the region of the cmd most affected by the galactic foreground , ( iii ) red - ward of a possible faint extension of the very blue extended hb .",
    "furthermore , we select a narrow strip of rgb stars ( box 2 ) , to limit the effect of binaries and errors in magnitude .",
    "the large number of rgb stars in the sample allows us this conservative choice .",
    "finally , the hb region is divided in two different regions , approximately corresponding to the red hb ( rhb ) and the blue hb ( bhb ) . as it has already been noted ( c02 ) ,",
    "the hb in ursa minor is substantially bluer than in draco .",
    "we also checked that these more restrictive selection criteria do not significantly affect our results both for the radial and for the luminosity distribution ( see next section for the comparison with l03 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] we can see that the bss candidates appear to be slightly less concentrated than both hb and rgb stars . the relative frequency of bsss is low especially within 1 @xmath34 , and there are hints of a maximum at a distance 1.5 @xmath35 .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this distribution is the absence of a central peak in the relative bss frequency , which is present in nearly every globular cluster .",
    "the distributions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are marginally consistent with flat distributions . in fact , if we try to fit @xmath37 with a flat distribution , the minimum non - reduced @xmath38 is 8.4 ( corresponding to a level of the flat distribution equal to 0.129 ) and 4.9 ( for a level of the flat distribution equal to 0.130 ) , for draco and ursa minor analysis are 5 for draco and 6 for ursa minor ( see fig .",

    "the resultant null hypothesis probability for a flat distribution is only @xmath39 for draco and @xmath40 for ursa minor .",
    "similarly , to fit @xmath36 with a flat distribution , the minimum non - reduced @xmath38 is 2.6 ( corresponding to a level of the flat distribution equal to 0.243 ) and 1.0 ( for a level of the flat distribution equal to 0.288 ) , for draco and ursa minor , respectively .",
    "the resultant null hypothesis probability for a flat distribution is @xmath41 for draco and @xmath42 for ursa minor .",
    "we also checked the probability that @xmath37 and @xmath36 are consistent with a distribution rising in the central bin and flat elsewhere . for draco , we found that this probability drops below 0.05 if the central bin is a factor of 1.00 ( 1.49 ) higher than the outer ones in the case of @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) . for ursa minor",
    ", the probability drops below 0.05 if the central bin is a factor of 1.45 ( 2.42 ) higher than the outer ones in the case of @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , we can conclude that the observed distribution of @xmath36 and especially @xmath37 are hardly consistent with a central rise like the one we observe in most of globular clusters ( m06 ) .",
    "if bss candidates were young ms stars , we would expect them to be more concentrated than older stars , consistent with observations where metal - rich ( younger ) stars are typically more centrally concentrated than metal - poor ( older ) stars ( e.g. tolstoy et al .",
    "2004 , battaglia et al . 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of bss does not show the clumping which could be expected in the case of a young population ( e.g. , fornax dsph ; battaglia et al .",
    "thus , the observed radial distribution of bss candidates suggests ( even if does not prove ) that these stars are bsss and not a young population .",
    "are these observed radial distributions consistent with models of bss formation and evolution ? according to the model by m04 and m06 , most bsss in the core of a dense host system form from collisions .",
    "a central peak in the relative bss frequency is expected only if a sufficiently large number of col - bsss can form .    the absence of any central peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is consistent with this model .",
    "in fact , in dsphs the stellar density , even in the core , is so low that stellar collisions are unlikely to occur ( where @xmath43 is the collision cross - section , @xmath44 the number of stars in the core , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the stellar number density and velocity dispersion in the core ) , is more than a factor of @xmath47 smaller in dsphs than in globular clusters . ] , and col - bsss can not form .",
    "the dearth of bsss in the centre is also favoured by the inefficiency of dynamical friction in dsphs : even if bsss have higher mass than both rgb and hb stars , it takes too long for them to sink to the centre .",
    "furthermore , m04 and m06 also predict that mt - bsss ( see section 4 ) have a relative frequency that is almost flat in the centre and slightly rising in the periphery .",
    "this implies that bss candidates in draco and ursa minor do behave like mt - bsss , whereas they are unlikely to be col - bsss .",
    "we compared our definitions of bsss and other populations with those used by l03 and tested the robustness of different choices .",
    "l03 adopt a wider definition of bss , and normalize the frequency of bsss to the number of sub - giant branch ( sgb ) stars .",
    "we used both our definition of bsss and normalization to the rgb stars and the l03 definition adapted for the distances and reddenings of draco / ursa minor , combined with a normalization to sgb stars .",
    "we do not observe any significant difference .",
    "this suggests that our results are reasonably independent of the bss selection criteria , and also of the stellar population we choose as a normalization control sample ( hb , rgb or sgb ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] it can also be seen that hb stars also seem to be slightly less concentrated than rgb stars .",
    "this again is consistent with trends seen in other dsph ( harbeck et al . 2002 ; l03 ; tolstoy et al . 2004 ; battaglia et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that older populations tend to be less centrally concentrated .",
    "in particular the blue old stellar populations ( bhb , blue rgb , etc ) tend to be less concentrated than their red counterparts ( rhb , red rgb , etc ) . however , as in the case of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath48 is also statistically consistent with a flat distribution .",
    "the luminosity distribution is another important indicator of bss properties .",
    "recent papers ( ferraro et al . 2003 ; monkman et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest a correlation between the brightness of bsss and their radial distance from the the centre of a globular cluster .",
    "bright bsss tend to be more concentrated than the faint ones . in turn",
    ", if the model of m04 and m06 is correct , such a correlation suggests that the centrally concentrated col - bsss tend to be brighter than mt - bsss .",
    "this scenario makes sense , as col - bsss should conserve a large fraction of the mass of the colliding progenitors ( benz & hills 1987 , 1992 ; sills et al .",
    "2001 ; freitag & benz 2005 ) , whereas the mass - transfer process is not as efficient ( pols & marinus 1994 ; tian et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in dsphs , where only mt - bsss are likely to form",
    ", we do not expect to see a correlation between the brightness of bsss and their radial position .",
    "this prediction is completely supported by the observed bss luminosity distribution of draco ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , left panel ) and ursa minor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the open histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] show the total luminosity distribution , while the light and heavy hatched histograms show the luminosity distribution of bsss which are located outside and within @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "according to the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , the probability that light and heavy hatched histograms are drawn from the same distributions is @xmath49 both for draco and for ursa minor .",
    "thus , there is no statistically significant difference between these distributions , indicating no dependence of the luminosity function on the radial distance .",
    "this fact is at odds with the findings by l03 , who observe a correlation between the brightness of bsss in sextans and their radial distance . since ( as we checked ) our luminosity distributions do not change by adopting the bss selection criteria by l03 , we suggest that this is due to an intrinsic difference between sextans and draco / ursa minor ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the data presented in the previous sections show that bss candidates in draco and ursa minor behave like mt - bsss . as a further check , we ran for draco and ursa minor the same kind of dynamical simulations that were performed by m04 and m06 for bsss in globular clusters .",
    "we adopt the upgraded version of the code by sigurdsson & phinney ( 1995 ) already described in m04 and m06 .",
    "the code integrates the dynamics of bsss , under the influence of the galactic potential , of dynamical friction ( using chandrasekhar formula ) and of distant encounters with other stars .",
    "also three - body encounters are implemented in the code ; but they are unimportant in the runs for dsphs .",
    "the potential of the host galaxy is represented by a time independent multimass king model .",
    "the classes of mass are the same as in m04 , and the assumed turn - off mass is 0.8 @xmath50 . to calculate the potential , we input the observed core density ( @xmath45 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath46 ) of draco and ursa minor (",
    "the adopted values are listed in table  1 ) , and we modify the value of the central adimensional potential , @xmath18 ( defined in sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) , until we reproduce the concentration and the density profile of the galaxy under consideration . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the density profiles of the best - fitting king models are compared with the data of ih95 . as expected ,",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath18 is a factor 5@xmath020 lower than the common values assumed in globular clusters .",
    "bsss are generated with a given position , velocity and mass .",
    "initial positions are randomly chosen according to a probability distribution homogeneous in the radial distance from the centre .",

    "masses larger than @xmath72 tend to be discarded by observations , both in our data ( see appendix  b ) and in globular clusters ( ferraro et al .",

    "in fact , the core radius of ursa minor is approximately twice as large as that of draco . in physical units ,",

    "the runs labelled as f1 in the case of both draco and ursa minor have been set up by taking the best - fitting parameters ( runs labelled as a1 ) and adding a small kick velocity @xmath82 to bsss born inside @xmath34 .",

    "the good agreement with data is evident : the model has @xmath83 for draco ( 5 data points ) and @xmath84 for ursa minor ( 6 data points ) . in summary ,",
    "the dynamical simulations reproduce the observations very well for all the possible mt - bss masses and lifetimes in the range allowed by the models .",
    "the best fit is achieved for the model with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for draco , and with @xmath87 and @xmath88 for ursa minor .",
    "however , all @xmath51 from 0 to @xmath34 are acceptable , as well as all the @xmath52 within @xmath89 from the best - fitting value .",
    "thus , bss candidates are consistent with a population initially distributed in an isothermal sphere between the centre of the galaxy and the tidal radius .",
    "this result agrees with the model of bss formation from mass - transferring binaries , and hints that bss candidates in draco and ursa minor are real mt - bsss .",
    "bsss have been observed in most globular clusters and at least in four dsphs : draco ( a01 ) , sculptor ( hurley - keller et al .",
    "1999 ) , sextans ( l03 ) , and ursa minor ( c02 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our findings with previous papers on both dsphs and globular clusters .",
    "previous studies of draco ( a01 ) and sculptor ( hurley - keller et al . 1999 ) do not report information about the radial distribution or the luminosity of bsss . however , hurley - keller et al . ( 1999 ) calculate the ratio @xmath90 in the inner region of the galaxy ( a box of 15@xmath9115 centred on the centre of the galaxy ) and in the outer one .",
    "they find that this ratio changes only by a factor 1.5 between the inner and the outer region , suggesting that bsss are not very concentrated .",
    "on the other hand , a01 suggest that bss candidates in draco are consistent with a population of intermediate age stars .",
    "in fact , they find a red clump population in the cmd diagram , which might support this interpretation .",
    "this hypothesis can not be ruled out also in the case of our data ( see discussion in appendix  b ) .",
    "c02 analysed the ratio of the number of ` blue plume ' stars ( corresponding to a wider definition of bss ) and the number of hb stars as a function of radius ( see their fig .",
    "10 ) in ursa minor .",
    "they find an almost flat distribution , whereas we note a small rise in the relative frequency of bsss around @xmath92 , but given the large error bars , our distribution is also consistent with a flat one ( @xmath93 with 6 data points ) .",
    "however , not only was the definition of bss in c02 different , but also the observed photometric bands : c02 build their cmd by plotting a _",
    "` v ' _ magnitude , which is actually the average between @xmath94 and @xmath95 magnitudes , versus the ( @xmath96 ) colour .",
    "thus , our results and those of c02 are not directly comparable . the most important fact is that both c02 and our findings suggest that there is no central peak of bsss in ursa minor .    as we already mentioned in section 3 ,",
    "l03 show both the radial and the luminosity distribution of bss candidates in sextans .",
    "furthermore , their data are more easily comparable with ours , as they use the same filters . however , even if we adopt the same definition of bss and the same normalization as l03 , we do not find in either draco or ursa minor any correlation between the brightness and the radial position of the bsss , unlike that reported by l03 in sextans .",
    "this discrepancy is unlikely due to the lack of statistics in our data , because , when we adopt the same selection criteria as l03 , the number of bsss rises to 198 in draco and 212 in ursa minor , which is quite close to the sample of l03 ( i.e. @xmath97 bsss ) .    the difference here might be due to statistical fluctuations , or could simply be connected with the intrinsic properties of sextans , which are quite different from those of draco and ursa minor .",
    "for example , sextans has a higher concentration index ( @xmath98 ) with respect to both draco and ursa minor , and it is very extended ( @xmath34= 16.6 and @xmath99 , ih95 ) . l03 show the radial distribution of bsss only within @xmath100 , without information about external bsss .",
    "it has recently been claimed that the centre of sextans contains a kinematically distinct stellar population , which might be associated with a star cluster ( kleyna et al .",
    "2004 ; but also see walker et al .",
    "indeed , the correlation between position and brightness of bsss could be explained by invoking the presence of a star cluster . in this case , the bright bsss , more concentrated toward the centre , could be col - bsss or even young stars formed in the star cluster ; whereas the faint bsss are mt - bsss , like those in draco and ursa minor .",
    "( we note that the distribution of faint bsss alone in sextans is quite similar to the distribution of the entire bss sample in draco and ursa minor . )",
    "what are the main differences between bsss in dsphs and bsss in globular clusters ?",
    "are there any globular clusters whose bsss behave like those in dsphs ?",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the distribution of @xmath101 of draco and ursa minor together with that of 47  tucanae and @xmath102 centauri ( from m06 ) .",
    "we chose 47  tucanae and @xmath102 centauri , because they have very different bss populations .",
    "47  tucanae is a sort of prototype for bsss in globular clusters : it clearly shows the bimodal bss relative frequency , which has been observed in more and more globular clusters in the last few years ( ferraro et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ; zaggia et al . 1997 ; ferraro et al . 2004",
    "; sabbi et al . 2004 ; warren , sandquist & bolte 2006 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "the clusters which do not have a bimodal distribution , in general show only the central peak of bsss , which rapidly drops outside the core ( see e.g. ngc1904 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "the bimodal distribution might be explained by requiring that the central peak is populated mainly by col - bsss , the external increase is due to mt - bsss which have not yet sank to the centre , and the minimum of the bss distribution is connected with the efficiency of dynamical friction ( m04 , m06 ) .",
    "in fact , the position of the minimum has been found to be equal to the maximum distance ( @xmath103 ) from the centre at which dynamical friction is able to bring binaries ( progenitors of mt - bsss ) into the core within the lifetime of the cluster ( m04 , m06 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "globular clusters without the external rise ( e.g. ngc1904 ) are expected to be poor in mass - transferring binaries , or not to have formed mt - bsss in the last gyrs .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] it is clear that the distribution of bsss in draco and ursa minor is completely different from that of a typical globular cluster like 47  tucanae . in particular , it seems that draco and ursa minor have only the peripheral rise of bsss , and completely lack the central peak .",
    "as we already discussed in section  3 , this supports the idea that the central peak in globular clusters is due to col - bsss , whereas the external rise is due to mt - bsss .",
    "instead , @xmath102 centauri is unique among the globular clusters where bsss have been already observed .",
    "in fact , @xmath101 and @xmath37 in @xmath102 centauri are both consistent with a flat distribution .",
    "m06 suggested that this distribution might be the product of both the lack of col - bsss in the core of @xmath102 centauri ( its core density being quite low ) and the inefficiency of dynamical friction .",
    "in fact , due to the joint effect of a low central density ( @xmath104 stars pc@xmath16 ) and of a high velocity dispersion ( @xmath105 km s@xmath13 ) , the dynamical friction time - scale in @xmath102 centauri is a factor of @xmath106200 longer than in 47  tucanae . as",
    "dynamical friction is inefficient , binaries do not sink into the centre , and the minimum in the bss distribution does not appear .    in this sense",
    ", @xmath102 centauri appears as something midway between the other globular clusters and the dsphs .",
    "different from dsphs , it can still form col - bsss in the centre , because its core density is considerably higher than that of dsphs ; but its dynamical friction is inefficient in moulding the shape of bss distribution , exactly as in dsphs . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] even suggests the idea of continuity between 47  tucanae , @xmath102 centauri and the two dsphs : as the central density of the system decreases , the central peak disappears , and the bss distribution becomes less and less concentrated .    in line with this idea",
    "is the distribution of @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) , which in 47  tucanae and in many other globular clusters is @xmath107 , in @xmath102 centauri is @xmath73 , while in draco and ursa minor it does not even appear in the plot , because it is consistent with 0 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we note that , apart from the bss distribution , @xmath102 centauri displays several features which are indicative of an object midway between globular clusters and dsphs : the metallicity spread , the evidences for rotation , the large mass and the low concentration are quite atypical for a globular cluster ; so that some authors ( zinnecker et al . 1988 ; freeman 1993 ; ideta & makino 2004 ) claim that @xmath102 centauri is not a real globular cluster , but the nuclear remnant of a dwarf galaxy .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] it is also apparent that the level of @xmath36 ( @xmath109 ) in draco and ursa minor is comparable with the level in 47  tucanae and @xmath102 centauri , analogous to most of the globular clusters ( see e.g. m06 ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the fraction of bsss versus hb stars in these two dsphs and in globular clusters are similar .",
    "this fact indirectly supports the hypothesis that bss candidates in ursa minor and draco are real mt - bsss .",
    "in fact , if all the bsss are mt - bsss , @xmath36 should reflect both the ratio of lifetimes and the fraction of stars in suitable binaries , and should be constant for the same turn - off mass and metallicity populations , if the binary fraction is constant .",
    "in this paper we addressed the problem of bss candidates in dsphs in general , and in draco and ursa minor in particular .",
    "there are two fundamental open questions about bsss in dsphs : i ) whether they are authentic bsss or young stars ; and ii ) what is their formation mechanism ?",
    "we analysed both the radial and the luminosity distributions of these stars , and we compared the data with dynamical simulations of bsss .",
    "the main feature of the observed radial distribution of bsss , normalized to rgb or hb stars , is the absence of a central peak .",
    "even if the young stars interpretation can not be dismissed ( at least for draco ; see appendix  b ) , this suggests that bss candidates in draco and ursa minor are actually true bsss .",
    "furthermore , the almost flat radial distribution is consistent with theoretical models ( m06 ) for mt - bsss , i.e. bsss which formed by mass transfer in isolated binaries .",
    "also the luminosity distribution , which does not show any correlation with the position of bsss , agrees with theoretical models of mass - transfer bss formation .",
    "these findings support the model by m04 and m06 , which explains the formation of bsss by the joint contribution of stellar collisions and mass transfer in isolated binaries .",
    "this model was originally developed only for globular clusters , but we find that it works also for dsphs .",
    "as predicted by m06 , the presence of a central peak in the relative frequency of bsss is due to col - bsss , and can be explained only if both stellar collisions and dynamical friction are efficient .",
    "the peak tends to disappear if the central density of the system is too low and/or its dynamical friction time is too long .",
    "this idea was confirmed by the absence of any central peak in @xmath102 centauri , and now we find that this result is even stronger in draco and ursa minor .",
    "low - density systems , where stellar collisions do not occur , can form only mt - bsss , whose initial distribution mirrors the distribution of the progenitor binaries .",
    "the less efficient the dynamical friction , the more the bss distribution is similar to the distribution of progenitor binaries .",
    "this idea is fully supported by draco and ursa minor bsss : the best - fitting simulations are based on an isothermal distribution between ( approximately ) the core and the tidal radius , as we would expect for a distribution of primordial binaries .",
    "furthermore , momany et al .",
    "( 2007 ) recently analysed the bss candidates of 8 dsphs ( draco and ursa minor among them ) and found a statistically significant anti - correlation between the relative frequency of bss candidates ( @xmath36 , calculated over the entire galaxy ) and the total luminosity of the dsph .",
    "if bss candidates were young ms stars rather than real bsss , such anti - correlation would not make sense .",
    "thus , from our analysis as well as from momany et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we conclude that bss candidates in draco and ursa minor behave like real mt - bsss , rather than young ms stars .",
    "this suggests ( even if it does not definitely prove ) that draco and ursa minor are fossil galaxies , where star formation was completely suppressed many gyrs ago .",
    "this scenario is also confirmed by recent simulations ( mayer et al .",
    "2007 ) , which indicate that draco and ursa minor , two of the closest dsphs to the milky way , had all their gas removed @xmath110  gyr ago , probably by tidal shocks and ram pressure exerted by the milky way .",
    "the fossil nature of draco and ursa minor would make them a natural place to study the conditions at the earliest epochs of galaxy formation .    on the other hand",
    ", it would be interesting to throughly study the nature of bss candidates in other dsphs , like sextans , where star formation probably lasted longer",
    ". the main goal would be to understand whether , and what fraction of , these stars are authentic bsss , in order to disentangle the history of bss formation from that of ms stars .",

    "fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : cmd_draco_full ] ) . removing",
    "such contamination is important , especially in the outer regions of the dsphs .",
    "we note that , although we refer only to ` foreground ' removal , the methods outlined below work equally well for the subtraction of the contamination by compact background objects .      in order to estimate the foreground contamination for rgb stars and bsss",
    ", we adopt the following method , both in draco and in ursa minor .",
    "first of all , we assume that all stars redder than ( @xmath111)=1.5 and with @xmath4 in the [ 19.5 , 23 ] range ( hereafter vrs , i.e. very red stars ) are in the foreground .",
    "in fact , the vrs region of the cmd ( box 5 in fig . [",
    "fig : cmd_draco_full ] ) should not be populated by stars belonging to draco , nor to ursa minor)@xmath1122.0 and the same @xmath4 magnitude range .",
    "no significant difference was found in our results . ] .",
    "second , we expect that all the stars which are outside @xmath113 do not belong to the dsph , independent of their colour and magnitude .",
    "this is useful because the draco data extend well beyond @xmath113 , and we can select a subset of ` external ' stars , which we define to include all the stars whose elliptical radial distance from the centre exceeds @xmath11=45.1.    we can therefore count the number of vrs , rgb and bss equivalents with @xmath114 ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , respectively ) , and we derive the ratios @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .    these ratios should be independent of position , as we have tested this in two ways .",
    "first of all , we looked for fluctuations of the surface density of vrs stars as a function of radius .",
    "although small fluctuations are present , the overall density can be considered constant in the whole draco field ( it is consistent with a constant value of 0.94 vrs / arcmin@xmath120 , with reduced @xmath1210.8 over 23 radial bins ) . as a further test",
    ", we split the ` external ' region into its eastern and western half and checked that there is no statistically significant difference between the values of @xmath122 and of @xmath123 which were obtained in the two halves .",
    "the foreground contamination of the @xmath5-th elliptical annulus can be estimated by counting the number @xmath124 of vrs stars in the annulus , and converting it into the expected number of foreground bsss ( rgb stars ) through the factor @xmath123 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "then , the corrected number of bsss ( rgb stars ) is simply @xmath125 where @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) is the number of bsss ( rgb stars ) observed in the annulus .    in the case of ursa minor",
    ", we do not have enough data at large radial distances from the centre , and therefore can not obtain a local estimate for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "for this reason , we use the values obtained for draco also for ursa minor .",
    "this is not optimal , but not unreasonable , as the two dsphs are at comparable galactic latitudes .",
    "the above procedure for rgb and bsss could also be used for hb stars . however , for hb stars we adopt a more straightforward technique , making use of the fact that the foreground does depend on colour , whereas it is nearly independent of magnitude ( at least in the range considered in our cmd ) .",
    "such a fact can not be exploited in the case of rgb and bsss , because it requires a cmd region which is both in the same colour range as bsss or rgb , and is populated by foreground stars only .",
    "however , for hb stars , the dashed regions labelled by 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd_draco_full ] are at exactly the same ( @xmath111 ) range of the regions ( labelled 3 ) where hb stars are selected , and are almost exclusively populated by foreground stars .    in order to account for the different foreground level for rhb and bhb stars , we further divided region 4 of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd_draco_full ] into two sub - regions : a blue one with the same colour range of bhb , and a red one with the same colours of rhb",
    ". we will refer to stars in the two sub - regions as to the fgbhb , and the fgrhb stars , respectively .    then , the corrected numbers of rhb ( bhb ) stars in the @xmath5-th annulus are @xmath128 where @xmath129(@xmath130 ) is the number of rhb ( bhb ) stars which was actually observed in the annulus , @xmath131(@xmath132 ) is the number of fgrhb ( fgbhb ) stars in the annulus , and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) is a correction factor which accounts for the different extensions of the various regions in the cmd .",
    "foreground subtraction is then carried out by subtracting the number of fgbhb ( fgrhb ) stars in the annulus ( after a correction accounting for the ratios of the cmd areas ) from the number of bhb ( rhb ) stars in the annulus .",
    "we note that this method of foreground subtraction has a slight dependence on the radial distance , the foreground level within the core radius being generally higher than outside .",
    "this is because , in addition to subtracting milky way stars in the foreground component , this technique also accounts for extra - effects ( like binaries , blending , errors in the observed magnitude and contamination from other stellar types , like rgb ) .    as a sanity check , we compared the distribution of hb stars obtained by using this method of foreground subtraction and that obtained using the same procedure as for rgb and bsss .",
    "the differences in the inner annuli are negligible . in the outer annuli ( @xmath135 , where @xmath34 is the core radius )",
    "the difference is larger , but remains within the ( quite large ) poissonian error bars .",
    "although we have shown that the properties of the observed bss population are fully compatible with the expectations for ` real ' bsss , the ` young star ' interpretation provided by a01 for draco still remains viable .",
    "a more direct test of the nature of this population can be performed by looking for other hints of a relatively young population .",
    "actually , the a01 interpretation of the bsss in draco was based on the observation of a small concentration of stars in a region of their cmd ( the ` red clump ' , i.e. region 13 of their fig .",
    "13 ) which should not be populated if no star formation occurred in the last 10 gyr .",
    "we plotted a set of theoretical isochrones over the draco and ursa minor cmds)=0.03 for both galaxies , a value for which a vast consensus exists .",
    "the distance modulus of ursa minor was chosen to be 19.41 [ bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and c02 found 19.41@xmath1360.12 and 19.40@xmath1360.10 , respectively ] .",
    "the distance modulus of draco is more controversial , as recent determinations yielded relatively different values : a01 , and bonanos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found compatible values ( 19.5@xmath1360.2 and 19.40@xmath1360.15@xmath1360.02 , respectively ) ; but bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a significantly higher value ( 19.84@xmath1360.14 ) .",
    "we adopted the intermediate value of 19.60 .",
    "we can not make an estimate from our data , as the tip of the rgb in our wfc data is beyond the saturation limit .",
    "] , varying both the age and the metallicity of the stellar population ( see fig .",
    "b1 for some examples ) . from such isochrones",
    "it is clear that bsss lie close to the isochrones describing low - metallicity ( @xmath137\\leq-1.5 $ ] , perfectly compatible with current estimates for draco and ursa minor ) stellar populations with ages between 2 and 3 gyr .    for draco we chose to combine a chabrier ( 2003 ) log - normal imf with an isochrone for an age of 2 gyr and a metallicity [ fe / h]=-2.0 , in order to estimate the number of stars which should be expected in other regions of the cmd if all of the observed bsss are actually part of an intermediate - age population . within this scenario ,",
    "the regions where we expect the maximum number of intermediate - age stars and the minimum contamination from the old population , are :      in table  b1 we list the theoretical predictions from the isochrones ( @xmath138 ) , the total number of stars observed in each cmd region ( @xmath139 ) , the estimated foreground contamination ( @xmath140 ) , and the number of observed stars after the foreground subtraction ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "it is clear that the predictions from the young star hypothesis are quite compatible with our observations of draco : the ratio of faint bsss to bright bsss is slightly lower than expected ( @xmath142 instead of @xmath143 ) , but the difference is just at the @xmath144 level ; on the other hand , the predicted number of young ms and red clump stars is perfectly compatible with observations , as both these cmd regions are likely to be contaminated by the old draco stellar population ( old ms stars close to the turn - off for the young ms region , rgb and especially - given the partial superposition of the two regions - hb stars for the red clump region ) .",
    "we applied the same method also to ursa minor , using an isochrone age of 2.5 gyr .",
    "results are summarized in table b2 , where we omitted the young ms region because of the very strong contamination from the old ms .",
    "the number of stars in the red clump region appears to be extremely close to the prediction from the young stars hypothesis , but a strong contamination is surely present , as the red clump selection box ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) largely superimposes with the hb ( see fig .",
    "such a strong contamination accounts for most of the ` excess ' stars in the considered cmd region .",
    "however , the young star hypothesis might still be viable , because most of the red clump stars might be ` hidden ' within the hb .    in summary ,",
    "the interpretation that bss candidates in draco are intermediate - age stars can neither be ruled out , nor be confirmed by the isochrone method applied to our observations",
    ". only a spectral analysis of stars in the red clump region could solve the uncertainty . in ursa minor such",
    "an interpretation is hardly compatible with current data ( see also c02 ) , but can not be completely ruled out .",
    "we point out that in both galaxies the mass of the intermediate - age population needed to explain the bss candidates is just about @xmath147 , which is a very small fraction of the mass of draco or ursa minor . if the age spread is @xmath148 1 gyr , the implied star formation rate is @xmath149 , comparable to the estimates shown in figs .",
