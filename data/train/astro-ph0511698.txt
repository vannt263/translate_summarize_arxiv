    "for a given initial mass function ( imf ) , the total expected amount of metals @xmath14 formed at a given time @xmath15 is simply the integral of the star formation history ( sfh ) or star formation rate density ( sfrd ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and others ) : i.e. , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean stellar yield @xcite .",

    "our knowledge of the cosmic metal budget is still highly incomplete , contrary to the situation at redshift @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "until very recently , it was thought that only a small fraction ( 20% ) of the budget is actually accounted for when one adds the contribution of the forest ( @xmath26  ) , damped   absorbers ( dlas ) ( @xmath27  ) , and galaxies such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite .    over the last decade , numerous samples of @xmath5 galaxies have emerged thanks to the increasing size and sensitivity of near - infrared detectors and to the availability of ultraviolet - sensitive instruments . on the one hand , the @xmath28 lyman break technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such an analysis suggests that galaxy populations at z@xmath62 only contribute about 50% to the total metal budget . in paper  iii",

    "the last piece of information needed to estimate the contribution of the bx galaxies to the metal budget is their metallicity .",

    ".    the more evolved sub - sample of the bx sources , namely bx@xmath42k20 galaxies , are rarer ( by a factor of 10 ) , but more massive ( by a factor of 5 ) , and more metal rich ( by a factor of 2 ) .",
    "thus , they double the total contribution of ` bx ' galaxies to the metal budget .",
    "the metal density of this subsample is : @xmath75 or 8%  of the metal budget .",
    "thus , the rare @xmath3-bright galaxies at @xmath5 are a major source of metals in the budget .",
    "we are still far from closing the metal budget however . if we take these numbers at face - value , as much as 18%  of the metals could be in bx galaxies .    regarding the ` bzk ' selection of @xmath37 galaxies by @xcite , we note that the mean redshifts for bzk / sf ( star - forming ) galaxies and bzk / pe ( passive evolving ) galaxies is @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively @xcite . focusing on the @xmath5 subsample ( i.e. , bzk / sf )",
    ", @xcite showed that the ` bx ' selection criteria and that the ` bzk / sf ' selection criteria overlap significantly ( @xmath78% ) to @xmath79 .",
    "we therefore view these two populations ( bx and bzk / sf ) as two strongly overlapping samples which do not require separate analyses of their contribution to the metal budget at z@xmath62 .",
    "having now considered a substantial number of samples of galaxies selected at z@xmath62 , we can now estimate the total metal budget in galaxies .",
    "we have estimated that 5% ( @xmath80% ) of the metals are in @xmath81 smgs ( brighter than 3  mjy ; as shown in paper  i ) , 18@xmath425%  in uv - selected and @xmath82-selected galaxies , and 5%  in dlas",

    "however , equation  [ eq : total : galaxies ] is a lower limit given that we really only considered the bright end ( @xmath84l@xmath85 ) of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "one obvious criticism of our approach is that given the limited depth of the selection images and the obvious incompleteness , could the metals hide in low luminosity / low mass galaxies ?",
    "while it is difficult to estimate what the contribution of the faint end of the luminosity function might be to the total metal budget , perhaps considering the local population of galaxies might be useful as a guide . in the local universe , while galaxies at the faint - end of the luminosity function are more numerous than the luminous galaxies , they are also more metal - poor ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    for the local universe",

    "50%  ( or more ) of the metal budget lies in the faint end of the lf .",

    "if we assume for simplicity that our numbers and estimates are appropriate for l@xmath13 and more luminous galaxies and that the z@xmath62 galaxies have a similar relative fraction of metals above and below l@xmath13 , it would suggest that we need to correct our total metal estimate by about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is likely an over - estimate of the true correction necessary for the faint end of the luminosity function and shows that the total contribution to the metal budget is roughly 60%  or less .",
    "in addition , this sum might also count some of the galaxy types twice , given that we effectively extrapolate to the faint end of the lf for each of the samples . given these caveats",
