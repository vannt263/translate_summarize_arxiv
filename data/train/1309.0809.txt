    "the mass distribution of the milky way inside @xmath18 is uncertain in many respects .",
    "while good measurements exist of the rotation curve , these do not allow the separation of the major galactic components : bulge , halo , and stellar and gas disks . hence the relative contributions as well as",
    "the density profiles of these components are still very uncertain .",
    "determining these is fundamental to our understanding of the milky way s formation and evolution and to evaluating the importance of dark matter within the visible extent of galaxies . because the milky way is in many ways an anchor point for empirical relations used to determine the physical properties of external galaxies ,",
    "this ultimately has a large impact on the study of the low - redshift universe @xcite .",
    "the structure , size , and mass of the milky way s disk in particular are poorly known .",
    "measurements of the radial scale length of the disk over the last few decades have produced values anywhere in between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview ) . while photometric measurements have improved with the advent of wide - area surveys with accurate photometry , systematic uncertainties in the distance scale significantly limit the precision and accuracy of photometrically measured scale lengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such measurements only trace the radial luminosity profile of the tracer stars rather than the mass profile of the disk .",
    "this is especially problematic as it has recently become clear that the stellar disk contains abundance - distinct subcomponents with scale lengths ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath21 @xcite , and in particular that the thicker disk components in the milky way have a much shorter scale length than the thin disk @xcite .",
    "thus , more than ever it is important to measure the mass - weighted radial profile , which can be achieved using the dynamics of tracer populations .",
    "there are currently no plausible dynamical measurements of the scale length of the disk . while there are global potential fits to a variety of dynamical data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these can not measure the scale length without strong prior assumptions as there have been no dynamical data and models that constrain the disk scale length to date ; because of this , the disk s scale length is the most important unknown in disentangling the contributions from the disk and the dark halo to the mass distribution near the disk @xcite .    in external galaxies ,",
    "rotation curves are often decomposed into disk and halo contributions using the maximum - disk hypothesis @xcite : the disk component is assumed to contribute the maximum amount possible without exceeding the rotation curve anywhere ; in practice this means that such maximal disks contribute @xmath22 of the rotation velocity at the peak of the disk rotation curve , allowing for the contribution of a bulge and a cored halo @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for or against the maximum - disk hypothesis is scant : e.g. , @xcite argues against spiral galaxy disks being generically maximal based on the residuals from the tully - fisher relation , while detailed gas kinematics shows that some disks , particularly fast rotators , are maximal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see @xmath23  [ sec : cfexternal ] for more discussion of this ) .",
    "ultimately , this is due to the fact that directly measuring and decomposing the mass profile of external disks is close to impossible .",
    "however , because mass - to - light ratios for external spiral galaxies are calibrated using the maximum - disk hypothesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fate of the maximum - disk hypothesis is intimately connected with many conclusions regarding the stellar - mass content of the low - redshift universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether the milky way has a maximum disk is unknown @xcite and determining whether it does is important since it can provide a robust data point for the discussion of the maximum - disk hypothesis and because it could be used to calibrate dynamical measurements of the radial profile of external galaxies . because the local midplane density and the local surface density are reasonably well measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whether the milky way s disk is maximal hinges on whether it has a short stellar disk mass scale length .    because the rotation curve reflects the sum of the radial in - plane accelerations contributed by the various galactic components , precise measurements of the radial profile and mass of only the disk also allows the radial profile of the dark - matter halo to be constrained .",
    "measurements of the local density of dark matter have significantly improved recently @xcite , but there are no dynamical constraints on the radial profile of dark matter at @xmath24 .",
    "the large microlensing optical depth measured toward the bulge argues for a relatively shallow halo profile @xcite , although this constraint has been relaxed compared to @xcite due to the downward revision of the optical depth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of the local dark matter density since 2001 @xcite .",
    "measuring the radial profile of dark matter in the inner milky way would be invaluable for analyses of dark - matter indirect detection toward the galactic center and for comparing the milky way to the predictions from cosmological simulations : a milky - way - like galaxy is presumed to have an inner dark - matter profile close to the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ; @xcite ) profile seen in simulations or steeper due to the adiabatic contraction that is expected to occur when the milky way s massive disk forms within the dark matter halo .    in this paper , we constrain the mass distribution in the inner milky way by measuring the vertical force at @xmath25 as a function of radius between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . because the vertical force and the surface density are approximately proportional near the disk @xcite , this quite directly measures the radial surface - density profile near the disk , allowing the mass - weighted scale length of the disk to be obtained without any prior assumptions derived from stellar number counts ; we measure the radial profile of the mass rather than that of the luminosity .",
    "we measure the vertical force as a function of radius using modeling based on simple , parameterized , six - dimensional ( phase - space ) , three - action distribution - functions ( dfs ) , developed by @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that this approach should work well when applied to subsets of galactic disk stars with very similar elemental abundances , so called mono - abundance populations ( maps ) .",
    "in a recent series of papers , we @xcite demonstrated that these constitute structurally - simple disk populations .",
    "such populations can hence be described well by few - parameter families of distribution functions , which allows a full likelihood - based exploration of the joint posterior distribution function ( pdf ) of dynamical ( gravitational potential ) and df parameters . in this paper",
    ", we apply this methodology for the first time to a real data set , g - type dwarfs from the sdss / segue survey @xcite .",
    "each map , i.e. , each distinct , abundance - selected stellar subset , can act as a separate tracer population of the gravitational potential .",
    "we focus our efforts in this paper on measuring the dynamical quantity of interest that is most robustly determined for each map .",
    "this turns out to be the vertical force at @xmath3 at a _ single _ galactocentric radius for each map , where the radius is determined directly from the dynamical pdf for each map ; because the maps span a wide range in orbital distributions , this leads to measurements between @xmath28 and @xmath29 for 43 maps .",
    "we use these new measurements in combination with constraints on the rotation curve , primarily from terminal - velocity measurements , and with measurements of the local vertical profile of the vertical force to constrain the mass distribution at @xmath24 and its decomposition into disk and dark halo contributions . because our measurements are at @xmath3 , we strongly constrain the properties of the milky way s disk , finding a relatively short mass scale length of @xmath30 and deriving precise measurements of the local column density of stars and of the total mass in the disk . we find that the milky way s disk is maximal , providing about @xmath31 of the rotational support at 2.2 radial scale lengths ( @xmath32@xmath13@xmath14 ; the rotational support is @xmath33 ) .",
    "as the halo contributes very little to the rotation curve and the vertical force at @xmath34 , we only weakly constrain the radial profile of the dark matter , but we nevertheless obtain a first constraint : @xmath17 at 95% confidence for a model in which @xmath35 .    the outline of this paper",

    "the distances to the sample stars range from @xmath44  kpc to nearly 4  kpc , with stars somewhat closer to the disk plane being sampled by the lines of sight at lower galactic latitudes",
    ". the effective minimal distance limit of the stars ( 600  pc ) implies that the vertical heights below one scale height ( @xmath45 ) of the thinner disk components is not well sampled by the g - dwarf data . as in bo12",
    ", we employ a signal - to - noise ratio cut of s / n @xmath46 .",
    "we transform distances and velocities to the galactocentric rest - frame by assuming that the sun s displacement from the midplane is 25 pc toward the north galactic pole @xcite , that the sun is located at 8 kpc from the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the sun s vertical peculiar velocity with respect to the galactic center is @xmath47 @xcite . in particular , we note that none of the results in this paper are affected by the details of the sun s peculiar motion in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we use the uncertainties on the distances , line - of - sight velocities , and proper motions to calculate the uncertainty in the vertical velocities , but otherwise we assume that distance uncertainties are negligible ( which is a good approximation because the typical distance uncertainty of @xmath48 is much smaller than any galactic spatial gradient ) .",
    "uncertainties are typically 10% in distance , @xmath49  mas yr@xmath50  in proper motion @xcite , and @xmath51 to @xmath52 in line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the distance errors are obtained by marginalizing over the color and apparent - magnitude errors that enter the photometric distance relation ( equation  ( a7 ) of @xcite , i08  hereafter , see also bo12d ) , which is assumed to have an intrinsic scatter of 0.1 mag in the distance modulus .",
    "these uncertainties lead to tangential velocity uncertainties that are @xmath53 at @xmath54 and a smaller contribution than that to the vertical velocity uncertainty ( depending on galactic latitude ) .",
    "stars in our sample at such large distances are either far from the plane as part of a population with a large velocity dispersion , or closer to the galactic center , where the velocity dispersion is larger by @xmath55 because it rises exponentially with a scale length of @xmath56 ( bo12c ) .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic dispersion is larger than the typical velocity - measurement uncertainty for all populations analyzed below .    motivated by the analysis in bo12  and @xcite , we treat in what follows maps as independent tracer populations of the galactic potential , whose fits provide independent constraints on the potential . operationally maps are defined here as stars whose @xmath57 $ ]  and @xmath58 $ ]  lie within bins @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 wide , as in bo12 .",
    "one significant change to the distances that we made for the current analysis is that we have placed the distances on the scale of @xcite , an09  hereafter , which was used in many other analyses of the segue g and k - dwarf samples ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which appears to provide more accurate distances from the kinematical tests of @xcite .",
    "these distances are typically @xmath61 smaller than the distances calculated using the i08  relation . because our method for correcting for color and metallicity biases in the sample selection requires a simple photometric distance relation ( see @xmath23  [ sec : method ] and  [ sec : normint ] below ) , we apply a single distance factor to the stars in each map  calculated as the mean distance modulus offset between the i08  and an09  relations for the stars in the map , taking into account the map s @xmath62 and @xmath57 $ ]  distributions ( see figure 1 of bo12d for the difference between the i08  and an09  distance scales as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath57 $ ] ) .",
    "these distance factors are shown in figure  [ fig : andistance ] .",
    "as discussed below , we have checked that our measurements of the surface density as a function of radius are affected by only a few percent by the difference between these two distance scales and are therefore much less sensitive to distance systematics than might be assumed ( but we stress that the an09  distances are more accurate and therefore the correct distances to use ) .",
    "because dynamical modeling such as that performed in this paper essentially succeeds by finding the gravitational potential that makes the observed velocities consistent with their observed spatial distribution in a dynamical steady state , the detailed understanding of the data sampling function that was crucial for bo12b and bo12d is again an important ingredient for the present analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix a of bo12d for a full description of the segue  g - star selection function .",
    "we begin with a segue  g - dwarf sample that has about 28,000 stars with acceptably well - determined measurements , but here we only use those 23,767 stars that fall within well - populated ` mono - abundance ' bins in the ( @xmath57$],@xmath58 $ ] ) plane ( bo12d ; a bin is well - populated when it contains more than 100 stars ; the maximum number of stars in a bin is 789 ) .",
    "furthermore , we exclude maps whose best - fit scale length in bo12d was larger than @xmath63 .",
    "we exclude these maps because their radial profile can not be well - fit with the simple df ansatz that we make below .",
    "these maps are all @xmath57$]-poor and have @xmath58 $ ]  close to solar ; they are primarily associated with the outer disk ( see figure 7 in bo12d ) .",
    "this removes 17 maps and leaves 16,653 stars in 45 maps . for reasons discussed below , we remove 2 maps from this sample ,",
    "such that the final data sample consists of 16,269 stars in 43 maps .",
    "while stellar dynamics overall is a long- and well - established field @xcite , the best ways to model large discrete data sets with full phase - space information are still being developed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in what follows",
    ", we analyze each map  separately and independently with the end goal of constraining the total surface density to @xmath64@xmath65 , abbreviated as @xmath66at a _ single _ galactocentric radius for each map . in this and the following section we describe all of the steps involved in fitting each map  as a population in a dynamical steady state in order to measure the gravitational potential and how we translate this into a single , robust measurement of @xmath67  at a single radius for each map .",
    "our measurements of @xmath66 assume that the rotation curve is flat ; if this is not the case , then we show in @xmath23  [ sec : systematics ] that we still robustly measure the vertical force at @xmath3 .",
    "the basic ingredients of the fitting procedure are :    * each map  is fit as a population of stars drawn from a quasi - isothermal df ( @xmath68 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this form for the df has a number of free parameters related to the radial density profile of the tracer population and the radial and vertical velocity dispersions and how they change with @xmath69 .",

    "the @xmath68  is a function of the orbital actions @xmath70 . for the fit",
    "we only need the @xmath71 transformation , which for the disk orbits in our sample can be efficiently , accurately , and precisely computed using a stckel approximation of the potential for any reasonable form of the potential near the galactic plane @xcite .",

    "we use a bulge + stellar disk + gas disk + dark halo model that a priori has many free parameters . for the present application we fix at fiducial values all but two of these parameters , the stellar disk scale length and the relative halo - to - disk contribution to the radial force (= circular velocity squared ) at @xmath72 .",

    "* we determine the probability of the position  velocity data ( the likelihood ) for each set of df + potential parameters using an expanded version of the methodology described in @xmath23  3.1 of bo12d , carefully accounting for the sample selection .",
    "the calculation of the effective survey volume consists of a nine - dimensional integral , whose fast computation is discussed in  [ sec : normint ] .",
    "we only use the vertical velocity component of the data and marginalize the six - dimensional qdf over the velocity components in the plane , because the planar motions do not constrain the vertical force and they may be affected by non - axisymmetric streaming motions .",
    "the fitting procedure is discussed in @xmath23  [ sec : fit ] . * for each map  we determine the full joint pdf for the df and the potential parameters . by marginalizing this over the df parameters we obtain constraints on the potential that include uncertainties in the determination of the correct df .",
    "the details on how we explore the pdf are given in @xmath23  [ sec : details ] .",
    "from the properties of the df we determine the galactocentric radius @xmath69 at which @xmath66 is best constrained for each map  and we calculate @xmath66 and its uncertainty @xmath74 from the pdf .",
    "this is described in @xmath23  [ sec : indivresults ] .",
    "we now describe these various steps in more detail .",
    "we use the quasi - isothermal df first proposed by @xcite and later refined by @xcite to fit the dynamics of a single map .",
    "bo12  found that the radial and vertical density profiles of individual maps are well represented by single exponentials and that the vertical velocity distribution is isothermal , i.e. , the vertical velocity dispersion is constant with height above the plane .",
    "further investigation of the galactocentric radial velocities showed that the radial velocity dispersion is also isothermal ( unpublished ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these properties of maps can be reproduced by assuming that the df is a quasi - isothermal df of the form of @xcite .",
    "therefore , in what follows we fit each map  as a single qdf .",
    "this is a simple way of including abundance information to separate different populations into the general approach followed by @xcite , where disk stars with any abundance were fit using a superposition of a large number of qdfs . in the current application , abundances are used to group stars that presumably can be fit using just a single qdf .",
    "the requirement that a map  can be modeled using a single qdf drives our fine - grained pixelization of the ( @xmath57$],@xmath58 $ ] ) plane .",
    "the form for the qdf as it is used here is that of @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is given by @xmath77\\\\    & \\qquad \\times\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\kappa      { \\ensuremath{j_r}}}{\\sigma_r^2(r_c)}\\right)\\ , .",

    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are free functions of @xmath81 , which indirectly determine the radial profiles of the tracer density , the radial velocity dispersion , and the vertical dispersion .",
    "however , it should be noted that these are merely _ scale _ profiles , as opposed to the actual , physical profiles that can be calculated by taking the appropriate moments of the df . in principle",

    "the diagonal edges in the distribution of @xmath117  and @xmath118  ( the radial action and the angular momentum , see below ) are due to the fact that circular orbits far from the solar neighborhood ( i.e. , outside of the bounds of our sample ) are not represented in our data set .",
    "similarly , in the distribution of the vertical action @xmath119 , stars with small vertical actions ( @xmath120small vertical energies ) are missing in our sample because of the effective lower limit on the vertical height of the stars in our sample ; stars with low vertical action do not reach high enough above the plane of the disk to be included in our sample .",

    "the difference between the stckel and adiabatic approximations is small for most observables , except for the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid .",

    ", it is the radius at which @xmath67  is most robustly determined . from the pdf of the dynamical parameters",
    ", we can then calculate the mean @xmath66 and its uncertainty at that radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustraterbest ] illustrates this procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdfs ] shows that the degeneracy in the pdf of the dynamical parameters , and therefore the correlation between @xmath67  and the disk scale length , is different for different maps .",
    "thus , the radius at which @xmath67  is best determined is different for the various maps .",
    "this is plausible as stars of a given map , found in the solar vicinity , are drawn from tracer populations of very different scale lengths ( bo12d ) .",
    "we expect that maps with abundances that are close to solar measure @xmath67  at a radius that is close to the solar circle , because these stars dominate the local population of stars and they spend much of their orbits close to the solar circle .",
    "likewise , we expect that the @xmath192-old  maps , which have short scale lengths and large velocity dispersion ( bo12 ) , spend a much larger fraction of their orbit at smaller radii and therefore measure @xmath67  closer to the galactic center .    to test whether this expectation is borne out in practice , and therefore , whether the procedure of determining the radius at which @xmath67  is best measured makes sense , we have calculated the median of the mean orbital radii of the data in each map .",
    "we use a simplified model for the milky way s gravitational potential that is the same as that used in sec .",
    "5.4 and figure 7 of bo12d , but the details of the mass model for the milky way used are unimportant for the calculation of the mean orbital radii . as we are interested in the vertical dynamics , we time - average over the orbits weighting by the midplane density ( @xmath237 vertical oscillation frequency squared ) .",
    "these median mean - orbital - radii for each map  are plotted against the radii with the most robust @xmath67  determination in figure  [ fig : rbest_vs_rmean ] , color - coded by @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : rbest_vs_rmean ] that there is a strong correlation between the radii calculated in these two entirely different manners ( apart from a single outlier in the lower - right corner ) .",
    "therefore , we can be confident that the procedure for calculating the radius at which each map  best measures @xmath67  provides a good definition for this radius .",
    "the color - coding confirms the expectation that @xmath192-old  maps constrain @xmath236 at radii much smaller than @xmath72 , while @xmath192-young  maps measure @xmath67  at positions close to the sun s .",
    "maps that are intermediate between these two measure @xmath67  at intermediate radii .",
    "one of the more @xmath192-young  maps in figure  [ fig : rbest_vs_rmean ] falls far from the relation defined by the other maps ( best @xmath67  radius of @xmath238 for a mean orbital radius of @xmath239 ) .",
    "however , this single map  does not influence any of the results obtained below .",
    "below , we quote results using the best radius as determined from the pdf ; if we instead require the measurements of the vertical force to be at the median of the mean orbital radii of the stars in each map , the best - fit surface - density and vertical - force profiles are unchanged , albeit with slightly increased uncertainties on the scale lengths .      even though the data from the different maps were sampled by the same survey centered on the solar radius ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) , they constrain @xmath66 at quite different radii . as a consequence",
    ", we can measure the galactic disk s surface density profile .",
    "for each map  we calculate the mean @xmath66 and its uncertainty @xmath74 at the best radius @xmath69 from moments of the pdf of the dynamical parameters .",
    "thus , we condense each map s dynamical information into the best single measurement of the milky way s mass distribution for that map .",
    "the surface densities thus measured are shown in figure  [ fig : surf ] and tabulated in table  [ table : surf ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : surf ] shows that the maps provide a highly precise measurement of @xmath66 between @xmath238 and @xmath240 and that the results from all 43 maps are in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "from a purely phenomenological perspective this measurement of @xmath66 can be well - characterized by a single exponential @xmath241 with formal uncertainties of @xmath242 in the normalization and @xmath243 in the scale length .",
    "however , we have no reason to expect that the real physical @xmath66 is a single exponential , as the mass distribution is made up of various disk components and the halo .",
    "we discuss this further in @xmath23  [ sec : potentialfit ] below , where we fit mass models .",
    "an alternative way of presenting our results is as measurements of the vertical force at @xmath3 , which we denote by @xmath244 , instead .",
    "these measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : kz ] and are also tabulated in table  [ table : surf ] . as with the measurements of @xmath66 , the radial dependence of the vertical force is well - fit by an exponential as @xmath245 again with formal uncertainties of @xmath242 in the normalization and @xmath243 in the scale length . as expected based on the vertical jeans equation and shown explicitly in the following section ,",
    "our @xmath246  measurements are more robust with respect to changes in the assumptions about the derivative of the circular velocity ( i.e. , the `` slope of the rotation curve '' ) .",
    "therefore , when using our measurements to constrain dynamical models of the milky way , it may be preferable to use the @xmath247 measurements rather than the @xmath236 , especially when considering models where the rotation curve is significantly non - flat .",
    "this is the approach we follow in @xmath23  [ sec : potentialfit ] below .",
    "we have assumed @xmath248 throughout the analysis .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath72 is to shift our measurements of @xmath66 and @xmath247 such as to keep @xmath249 constant ( i.e. , our measurements are at a fixed distance from @xmath72 ; see also @xmath23  [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "therefore , our measurements can be shifted to a different value of @xmath72 by keeping @xmath249 ( see table  [ table : surf ] ) constant .",
    "the measured @xmath66 or @xmath247 in figures  [ fig : surf ] and [ fig : kz ] and tabulated in table  [ table : surf ] are 43 new , independent constraints on the milky way s mass distribution and gravitational potential .",
    "they can be combined with other constraints , such as measurements of the vertical mass distribution as in @xcite and @xcite , and constraints on the rotation curve from the terminal velocity curve or based on stellar tracers .",
    "this is the approach that we take in @xmath23  [ sec : potentialfit ] , where we show that the map  measurements of @xmath66 quite directly constrain the disk scale length and through combination with data on the rotation curve can be used to disentangle the disk- and halo contributions to the mass distribution in the inner milky way .",
    "rrrrrrrr    [ table : surf ]      the results in the previous section are obtained in the fiducial model in which we use the an09  distance scale for the g - type sdss dwarfs and we fix the parameters of the gravitational potential model such that @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 . in this section",
    "we determine the impact of these choices and find them to be small and largely inconsequential for the measurement of @xmath66 and especially @xmath247 , and for the dynamical analysis in @xmath23  [ sec : potentialfit ] below .",
    "we assess the impact of systematic distance uncertainties by performing the analysis of the map  dynamics when using the distances of i08  instead of the an09  distances in our fiducial model .",
    "as discussed in @xmath23  [ sec : data ] , the i08  distances are typically @xmath253 larger than the an09  distances to g - type dwarfs , with the detailed relative distance factors given in figure  [ fig : andistance ] . as discussed in bo12d , the impact of unresolved binaries is such that distances would be @xmath254 larger , so the difference between the results obtained using i08  distances and those derived from an09  is a good proxy for understanding the impact of typical systematic distance uncertainties affecting the data .",
    "we expect the impact of systematic distance uncertainties to be such that @xmath255 , with @xmath256 and similar for @xmath246 . this is because roughly @xmath257 , such that if the measurement is dominated by proper motions , such as when one observes the vertical motions of disk stars far from the sun , @xmath258 . similarly , if the measurement primarily depends on the line - of - sight velocities , which is the case when measuring @xmath67  at @xmath72 by looking at the motions of stars near the galactic poles , @xmath259 .",
    "because the measurement of @xmath67  has contributions from both proper motions and line - of - sight velocities , we expect @xmath67  to scale with distance in a manner that is in between these two extremes .",
    "we expect the scaling to be different for different maps , as maps that measure @xmath67  at smaller @xmath69 rely more on proper motions than maps that measure @xmath67  closer to the solar circle .",
    "we show the comparison between the measured @xmath67  obtained using the i08  distances with those derived from the an09  distances in figure  [ fig : systematics_dist ] .",
    "the difference in the measured @xmath67  is shown for each map  at the radius at which the map  best measures @xmath67  determined for the fiducial model .",
    "the dashed lines show the approximate locus of the linear and inverse scalings with distance discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this figure shows that the impact of the systematic distance shift between the two distance scales is small for the majority of the maps .",
    "maps that measure @xmath67  at @xmath260 rely more on proper motions and their measured @xmath67  therefore scales close to linear with the distance scale .",
    "most of the maps that measure @xmath67  at @xmath261 are only affected at the few percent level by the uncertainty in the distance scale .",
    "@xmath244 is affected in the same way as @xmath67 .",
    "the overall impact of the change in the distance scale between that of i08  and an09  on @xmath66 is small .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : systematics_dist ] that the effect of using the larger distances is to slightly steepen the @xmath66 profile .",
    "the best - fit exponential approximations to @xmath66 and @xmath247 obtained using the i08  scale , using the optimal radii derived from the pdfs for the i08  scale are @xmath262 which is very close and within the statistical uncertainties of the result obtained using the an09  scale ( equation  [ [ eq : bestfitsig ] ] ) .",
    "therefore , the impact of systematic distance uncertainties on the measurement of @xmath66 and @xmath247 is insignificant , at the level of @xmath263 .    to determine the impact of the rather constrained fiducial model for the gravitational potential , we repeat the measurement of @xmath66 for different choices for the most important fixed parameters of the potential .",
    "foremost among these is the normalization of the potential , characterized by the local circular velocity in our parameterization .",
    "we have fixed this to @xmath250 in the fiducial model . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : systematics1 ]",
    "we compare the results when using @xmath264 to those obtained for the fiducial model , again at the radius determined using the fiducial model .",
    "we see that the impact of changing the potential normalization is close to zero for almost all maps and in all cases the shift is much smaller than the random uncertainties .",
    "the dashed line in this figure shows the expected difference if @xmath265 , the expected scaling if the measured surface - density were wholly dependent on the normalization of the potential ( or equivalently , of the rotation curve ) , that is , if we were not really measuring @xmath67  or @xmath246 .",
    "@xmath247 behaves the same when changing @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , in the second panel we compare the results obtained using @xmath266 to those from the fiducial model ; these two sets of results are again nearly indistinguishable and the difference is much smaller than the @xmath265 expectation ( dashed line ) .",
    "note in this case that the measured value for @xmath250 for the bins that measure @xmath67  at @xmath267 is at the edge of the prior range for @xmath266 , which artificially lowers the inferred @xmath67  for these maps ( this is clear from an inspection of the pdfs ) . the best - fitting exponential approximations to @xmath66 and @xmath247 measured from the @xmath268 results are @xmath269 and those from the @xmath270 results are @xmath271 therefore , the scale length of @xmath66 hardly changes and the normalization is only affected by a few percent , which is similar to the statistical uncertainties in the fit .",
    "we have also performed an extreme test where we set @xmath272 , far beyond any reasonable setting for this parameter .",
    "setting @xmath159 to @xmath273 shifts the prior on @xmath66 in figure  [ fig : prior - surface - range ] upward such that many of the best - fit @xmath67  in figure  [ fig : surf ] lie on the edge or slightly outside the prior range .",
    "we find that the measured @xmath236 for @xmath159 are all on the lower edge of the prior , such that they clearly indicate that @xmath67  is in reality lower than what is allowed by the @xmath274 prior . even in this extreme case ( which should not be trusted ,",
    "since all measured @xmath67  are on the edge of the prior ) , the scale length of the best - fitting exponential is @xmath275 and the normalization only changes to @xmath276 .",
    "this change in normalization is only @xmath277 , while @xmath278 has changed by @xmath226 .",
    "this and the results for @xmath279 and @xmath280 confirm that we are primarily measuring @xmath67  ( or @xmath246 ) such that the assumed normalization of the potential is unimportant as long as it permits the inclusion of the actual @xmath67 .    in the fiducial model , the scale height of the stellar disk",
    "is fixed to @xmath251 , which is the mass - weighted scale height inferred from the map  decomposition of bo12  and agrees with dynamical measurements of the disk scale height based on @xmath281 @xcite .",
    "however , the mass - weighted scale height of the disk is still quite uncertain . because we are primarily measuring @xmath67  using the vertical kinematics",
    ", we do not expect our results to depend on the disk scale height , which for any reasonable value changes the vertical distribution of disk matter below approximately @xmath34 , but not above it ( as at most a few disk @xmath282 are above @xmath34 ) .",
    "we have repeated the analysis above using a scale height of @xmath201 , which is at the low end of plausible values of this parameter .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : systematics1 ] demonstrates that the inferred @xmath236 for all maps barely change when using a different stellar - disk scale height , and all changes are within the random uncertainties of the measurement .",
    "the inferred @xmath66 and @xmath247 are almost exactly the same as those measured using the fiducial potential model : @xmath283 and @xmath284    the final important parameter of the gravitational - potential model is the slope of the rotation curve , set to @xmath285 in the fiducial model . from the vertical poisson equation",
    "it is clear that the slope of the rotation curve changes the surface density measured from vertical kinematics by adding approximately @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "locally this amounts to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath287/0.1)\\]]@xmath288 given the current uncertainty in the slope of the rotation curve ( see below ) . however , we expect the vertical force @xmath289 to be unaffected by this , because the vertical jeans equation shows that @xmath289 is constrained by the vertical dynamics only and that it does not depend on the slope of the rotation curve .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig : systematics1 ] show the change in the measured @xmath67  and @xmath246  ( gray diamond symbols ) when changing the assumed slope of the rotation curve .",
    "this changes the slope of the model rotation curve at all @xmath69 and the dashed lines show the expectation from the simple calculation given in the previous paragraph assuming that the change is such that @xmath290 at all @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that the measurements of @xmath67  are strongly and systematically affected by the change in the slope of the rotation curve , especially near @xmath72 .",
    "the inferred @xmath66 profile changes by about twice the random uncertainties : @xmath291 however , the measured @xmath244 is much less affected by the change in the slope of the rotation curve and the change in @xmath246  is well within the random uncertainties for all maps .",
    "the inferred @xmath247 profile changes only by about @xmath292 : @xmath293 therefore , the inferred @xmath246  are more robust to changes in the assumed rotation curve .",
    "when using our measurements in analyses where the rotation curve is varied or assumed to be very different from the flat rotation curve in our fiducial model , we recommend using the @xmath246  measurements instead of the @xmath67  measurements .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of changing the value of @xmath72 .",
    "one would expect that our measurements , which are based on a volume centered on the sun , are at constant distances from the assumed @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we should find that a measurement of @xmath236 or @xmath244 at @xmath69 for @xmath248 is at @xmath294 , where @xmath295 , for a different value of @xmath72 .",
    "we have performed the full @xmath236 measurement for the two maps in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] using @xmath296 and have found that the inferred @xmath236 and @xmath244 is indeed shifted by @xmath297 for these maps , such that their measured @xmath67  and @xmath246  are the same as for the fiducial @xmath72 , but at galactocentric radii that are @xmath298 larger .",
    "we are therefore confident that this holds for the measurements from all of the maps .",
    "table  [ table : surf ] contains a column that lists the radius @xmath299 at which @xmath67  and @xmath246  is measured ; this value should be kept constant when changing the assumed value of @xmath72 .",

    "below , we are primarily interested in determining the mass scale length of the stellar disk and this measurement is mainly dependent on the logarithmic slope of the surface density profile . as this slope does not depend on the assumed value of @xmath72 , we do not vary @xmath72 in the analysis below .",
    "the measurement of the vertical force profile between @xmath238 and @xmath240 presented in the previous section provides a strong new constraint on mass models for the inner milky way .",
    "we explore these constraints in this section .",
    "we find that the stellar disk scale length is largely constrained by the measurements of @xmath247 , but we also consider additional data on the rotation curve and the local vertical mass distribution to separate the disk and halo contributions to the total mass .",
    "these additional data are described in @xmath23  [ sec : adddata ] .",
    "the results of mass - model fits to these data are presented in @xmath23  [ sec : fitresults ] .",
    "+    as additional constraints on the mass distribution in the inner milky way , we use data on the rotation curve and the vertical mass distribution near the sun .",
    "the rotation - curve data that we use are in the form of terminal velocities measured through hi and co emission . in the fourth quadrant",
    "we use the hi data from @xcite and in the first quadrant we use the co data from @xcite , both binned into bins of @xmath300 .",
    "these terminal velocity measurements are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : bestfit ] . because the terminal velocities are characterized by wiggles on the order of @xmath52 that are likely due to the effects of non - axisymmetry , we model these data very conservatively by assuming that they have an uncertainty of @xmath301 correlated over @xmath302 .",
    "this makes sure that wiggles typical of non - axisymmetry do not affect our results . because the terminal velocities depend on the sun s peculiar velocity in the plane of the milky way through terms proportional to @xmath303 and @xmath304 , we further marginalize over such terms in the fits below , so that any effects of non - axisymmetry and the sun s peculiar velocity do not affect the analysis .",
    "we further use constraints on the local slope of the rotation curve .",
    "such constraints exists , e.g. , from the measurement of the oort constants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the kinematics of masers in the disk of the milky way @xcite , or from the kinematics of stars throughout the disk @xcite .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath305 of @xcite encompasses the results from these different analyses , we use it to represent the current uncertainty in the logarithmic slope of the rotation curve .",
    "we represent the @xcite measurement with the simple analytic form @xmath306 which approximately matches the pdf for @xmath305 of @xcite . we stress that we do _",
    "not _ use any measurements of the circular velocity itself .",
    "this way we can assess what direct measurements of the mass distribution combined with measurements of the _ shape _ of the rotation curve ( but not its normalization ) constrain the circular velocity to be .",
    "finally , we also include measurements of the vertical mass distribution near the sun , @xmath281 .",
    "a number of such measurements exist in the literature and we use the results from @xcite , which are the best measurements of @xmath281 to date and they are consistent with all other measurements .",
    "we only use the measurement of @xmath307 and the measurement of the stellar disk surface density @xmath308 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath309 is consistent with our much tighter measurement in @xmath23  [ sec : surfresults ] and therefore it does not contain much additional information , but the measurement of the stellar disk surface density is useful for separating the contribution from the disk and the dark halo to the mass budget .",
    "we use the same mass model as described in @xmath23  [ sec : potential ] , except that we replace the bulge model with an exponentially cut off power - law with a power - law exponent of @xmath206 , a cut - off radius of @xmath310 , and a mass of @xmath311 , because this is a more realistic model for the mass distribution of the bulge ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we fit this to various combinations of ( a ) the measurements of @xmath247 of @xmath23  [ sec : surfresults ] , ( b ) the terminal velocity data , ( c ) the constraint on the local slope of the rotation curve from equation  [ eq : dlnvcdlnrprior ] , and ( d ) the measurements of @xmath309 and @xmath312 from @xcite .",
    "we now vary all five of the basic parameters of the mass model , that is , the stellar disk mass scale length and scale height , the circular velocity , the relative halo - to - disk contribution to @xmath235 , and the local @xmath313 .",
    "none of the considered data really constrains the stellar scale height , but its value is uncorrelated with the value of the other parameters ; we let it vary between @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",

    "figure  [ fig : pdf_rd_vcdvc ] shows the joint pdf for the stellar disk scale length and the contribution of the stellar disk to the circular velocity at 2.2 scale lengths ( @xmath316 the peak of the disk rotation curve ) .",
    "the latter parameter determines whether the milky way s disk is maximal using the definition of @xcite , according to which a disk is maximal when its contribution to @xmath155 at 2.2 scale lengths is @xmath317 .",
    "we show the constraints from different combinations of the dynamical constraints .",
    "the red curves show the contours of the pdf based on the @xmath247 measurements from this paper only , while the black curves give the constraints based on all of the dynamical data .",
    "it is clear that the measurements of @xmath247 from this paper alone measure the scale length , largely independent of the contribution to the mass from the other galactic components .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_rd_vcdvc ] also shows that the additional dynamical data from @xmath23  [ sec : adddata ] does not constrain the stellar disk scale length .",
    "the joint pdf for the scale length and disk - maximality parameter based on the rotation curve and @xmath281 does show the familiar relation that for the disk to be maximal , the disk scale length needs to be small .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath247 measurements from this paper are the single most important existing dynamical constraint on the stellar disk scale length of the milky way .",
    "the result from the combined fit to all dynamical data gives @xmath318 the combination of the @xmath247 measurements and the additional dynamical data shows that the disk is maximal since @xmath319    these measurements of the stellar disk scale length and its contribution to the rotation curve allow us to derive the mass of the disk .",
    "we can measure the surface density of the stellar disk because the additional data on the rotation curve described in @xmath23  [ sec : adddata ] combined with the @xmath247 measurements from this paper allow us to disentangle the stellar and dark - halo contributions to @xmath66 .",
    "we find that the surface density of the stellar disk at @xmath72 is @xmath320 , for a total surface density to @xmath3 of @xmath321 , @xmath322 of which is assumed to be in the thin ism layer . as a consequence of ours being a full 3d dynamical model ,",
    "this measurement of @xmath163 is a real measurement of @xmath163 as opposed to a measurement of @xmath309 converted to @xmath163 .",
    "the fact that it agrees so well with the local normalization of our measured @xmath66 profile in equation  ( [ eq : bestfitsig ] ) is due to the fact that the local slope of the circular velocity curve is very close to flat in our best - fit model ( see below ) .",
    "our measurement of the local surface density to @xmath3 is consistent with all previous measurements ( which are really @xmath309 measurements ) but with a smaller uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we note in particular that the measurement of @xcite of @xmath323 is consistent with our measurement ; our much smaller errorbar leads to a much tighter measurement of the local dark matter density ( see below ) .",
    "as mentioned above , none of the dynamical data in @xmath23  [ sec : adddata ] constrain the mass scale height of the stellar disk : we obtain a flat pdf for @xmath137 over the prior range @xmath324 . to illustrate how @xmath137 can be constrained using measurements of the ( surface density ) at heights different from @xmath325",
    ", we fit the dynamical data from @xmath23  [ sec : adddata ] together with the constraint on the total midplane density at @xmath72 from @xcite : @xmath326 . while all of the other dynamical parameters are unchanged ,",
    "in this case we do constrain the mass scale height : @xmath327 , in good agreement with the measurements from star counts ( @xmath328 , see above and bo12d ) and constraints from the vertical profile of @xmath329 ( @xmath330 at @xmath331 confidence ; @xcite ) .    using our measurements of the disk mass scale length and the local disk normalization",
    ", we can derive the total mass of the disk , to the extent that a characterization of the disk with a single scale length makes sense .",
    "we find that the total stellar disk mass is @xmath332 .",
    "under our assumption that the local ism column density is @xmath322 and that the ism layer has a scale length twice that of the stellar disk , the ism contributes @xmath333 for a total ( stars+gas ) disk mass of @xmath334 . note that in our model the ism layer s scale length is tied to that of the stellar disk and that the local normalization is fixed",
    "therefore , the mass of the ism layer is perfectly correlated with that of the stellar disk , and the uncertainty in the total disk mass would be @xmath335 .",

    "we do not discuss this here in detail as this needs to be looked at carefully , accounting for the mix of different components of the disk and their radial dispersion profiles ( which are poorly constrained currently ) , and for the finite thickness of the disk .",
    "a plausible way toward measuring the local dark halo density profile is to combine the rotation curve , which measures the total mass as a function of radius but is relatively insensitive to the flattening and therefore can not separate the disk s contribution from the halo s , with independent measurements of the disk contribution as a function of radius , as provided in this paper . the constraints on the halo parameters  the local normalization @xmath346 and power - law index @xmath192 in @xmath347from",

    "however , the combination of these two dynamical probes allows us to put a first constraint on the radial profile .",
    "the combination gives @xmath350 this encompasses a cored halo as well as an nfw halo , although very steep halo density profiles are ruled out .",
    "we constrain the local dark matter density to be @xmath351 , consistent with more direct measurements of this quantity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which measure the dark matter density using the vertical dependence of @xmath352 ( @xmath353 ) rather than the radial dependence of @xmath246  as we do here .",
    "finally , while we do not measure the local circular velocity in a direct manner , we do constrain it indirectly in its guise of providing the normalization of the forces in our model and thus setting the mass scale . a comparison between the value of @xmath159 measured in this way and more direct measurements",
    "can therefore test whether the vertical dynamics is consistent with the planar dynamics .",

    "the constraints from the terminal velocities alone show the familiar degeneracy , indicating that the terminal velocities only measure a combination of @xmath155 and the slope of @xmath354 .",
    "the constraints from the vertical dynamics ( red curves ) have a different degeneracy and strongly disfavor rising rotation curves .",
    "the combination of the terminal velocities and the vertical dynamics therefore measures the properties of the circular velocity curve , and we find that @xmath355 and @xmath356 , consistent with a flat rotation curve .",
    "these measurements are consistent with the recent apogee measurements of @xcite , which are shown for comparison .",

    "a combination of the data considered in this paper with the apogee results gives @xmath360 and @xmath361 . as the measurements of this paper and the apogee measurements are very different in the way that they probe the dynamics of the disk ,",

    "figure  [ fig : rotcurves ] shows a different representation of all of the results described in this section . shown",
    "are the total rotation curve and its decomposition into stellar - disk and halo contributions .",
    "the total and stellar - disk rotation curves are quite tightly constrained by our dynamical data .",
    "this is mostly due to our precise measurement of the stellar disk scale length , which was made possible by our measurements of @xmath247 over @xmath363 .",
    "the dark halo contributes significantly less to @xmath354 than the stellar - disk at all @xmath364 .",

    "we believe that this paper presents the first dynamical measurement of the milky way disk s mass profile . other measurements of the scale length are either based on star counts and it is therefore unclear whether they trace all of the mass in the disk ( e.g. , @xcite , bo12d ) , or they are based on previous dynamical data that leave the scale length essentially unconstrained ( @xcite ; figure  [ fig : pdf_rd_vcdvc ] ) unless strong priors are used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it turns out that our best - fit model for the mass distribution in the inner @xmath165 of the milky way is similar to that of model i in @xcite , which has a maximal disk with a scale length of @xmath19 .",
    "if star counts do trace the underlying mass distribution , then we can compare our dynamically - inferred scale length with that measured from star counts .",
    "there have been many measurements over the last few decades of the radial scale lengths of the thin and thick - disk components spanning a wide range between @xmath365 and @xmath20 .",
    "these measurements have greatly improved over the last few years with the advent of larger - area surveys with precise multi - band photometry leading to better photometric distances .",
    "for example , @xcite measured a scale length of @xmath366 from hst star counts of m dwarfs , whose distribution is expected to trace that of the underlying stellar mass , and @xcite found from an analysis of sdss star counts that the thin disk scale length is @xmath367 .",
    "both of these are somewhat larger than the scale length measured in this paper .",
    "this offset may be due to systematic uncertainties in the photometric distances used by analyses of star counts .",
    "another , in our view more likely explanation is that these analyses did not take into account that the radial scale lengths of different stellar disk components vary strongly .",
    "in particular , the scale lengths of the old , thick components of the disk are only @xmath368 ( @xcite ; bo12d ; @xcite ) .",
    "this lowers the scale length of the mass profile compared with that of the thin - disk components , an effect which is larger at @xmath153 , where most of our @xmath67  measurements lie .    a proper comparison between the dynamically - inferred scale length and that measured from star counts should therefore take into account the full , complex structure of the disk .",
    "bo12  showed that the disk is made up of many components with scale lengths ranging from @xmath19 for the oldest populations to @xmath21 for the younger populations .",
    "the mass scale length of the stellar disk is determined by the sum of all of these components , whose combined density profile defines an effective disk scale length at every radius .",
    "this effective disk scale length based on the re - assembly of the map  decomposition of bo12  is shown in figure  [ fig : map_rd ] ( the map  scale lengths of bo12d have been re - scaled to the an09  distance scale ) .",
    "the stellar mass profile derived from summing over all maps is not a single exponential , but has a profile whose effective disk scale length increases smoothly from @xmath368 in the inner disk to @xmath369 at @xmath370 .",
    "the dynamical measurement from this paper compares well with that inferred from star counts : the dynamical estimate falls short of the star - counts measurement by about @xmath292 .",
    "nevertheless , this comparison lends credence to the interpretation that the stars in the galactic disk are indeed the dominant contributors to the ` dynamically inferred disk mass ' derived here . with measurements in the outer disk at @xmath371",
    ", the map  star - counts model predicts that one should dynamically measure a mass scale length @xmath372 .",
    "we can further compare our dynamical measurement of the stellar - disk surface density at @xmath72 , @xmath373 , with estimates based on direct star counts .",
    "estimates of the total amount of ordinary stellar matter are @xmath374 ( @xcite;bo12b ) with an additional @xmath375 contributed by stellar remnants and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these estimates have uncertainties of a few @xmath376 , which includes the uncertainty in the shape of the initial mass function at low masses ( see bo12b ) .",
    "thus , our dynamical measurement of the disk mass properties is in excellent agreement with direct star - counts .",
    "that the dynamical and star - counts measurements of the stellar - disk scale length and of the local stellar surface density agree so well is evidence that basically all of the mass in the stellar disk is accounted for by ordinary stellar matter orbiting under the influence of newtonian gravity .",
    "our results leave little room for a dark disk component in the milky way @xcite , because the presence of such a component would increase our estimates of the local surface density and of the mass scale length . similarly , in the mond theory of modified gravity the local surface - density to @xmath3",

    "@xcite , such that we expect for @xmath380 that @xmath381 .",
    "this prediction is in @xmath382 tension with our measurement of @xmath321 .",
    "furthermore , in mond the dynamically - inferred disk scale length ( i.e. , that inferred from @xmath383 measurements ) is predicted to be @xmath384 larger than that measured from star counts @xcite , so we would expect to dynamically measure a scale length of @xmath385 .",
    "this is @xmath386 removed from our measurement of the mass scale length .",
    "we emphasize that these are preliminary tests of mond based on the bekenstein ",
    "milgrom @xcite formulation of mond and that these tests should more fully take into account the uncertain structure of the baryonic disk .",
    "however , it is clear that the measurements from this paper and further improved measurements of the vertical forces in the milky way are key to improved tests of modified gravity models such as mond on galaxy scales .",
    "our measurement of the mass scale length of the disk now makes our measurement of the galactic disk mass the most accurate estimate to date .",
    "our measurement of @xmath387 compares well with the range found by @xcite ( who also assume @xmath248 ) , who estimated the stellar - disk mass as a function of an assumed scale length .",
    "our measurement of the scale length falls at the lower end of their considered range where their stellar disk mass is @xmath388 .",
    "our estimate of the baryonic mass in the galaxy of @xmath389 also agrees with their estimate of @xmath390 .",
    "however , it is important to note that ours is a purely dynamical measurement , while flynn s value relies on assumptions about the stellar mass function in the disk and about the manner in which mass traces light .",
    "both measurements are similarly affected by the uncertainty in @xmath72 .",
    "the measurements of the milky way s disk mass scale length and stellar mass from this paper allow us to make comparisons of the milky way with external galaxies , e.g. , through the tully - fisher relation , initially put forth by @xcite , more precise .",
    "a main source of systematic uncertainty in @xcite was the uncertainty in the value of the radial scale length , which a priori could have been anywhere between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our measurement of @xmath391 removes this source of uncertainty . using @xcite s calculations of the total @xmath392-band luminosity of the milky way we find that @xmath393 ( @xmath394 ) . using a bulge luminosity of @xmath395 @xcite ,",
    "we find that @xmath396 combined with our measurement that @xmath355 , this allows us to place the milky way onto the tully - fisher relation defined by nearby disk galaxies : it falls well within the @xmath292 scatter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as this relation predicts @xmath397 for @xmath398 with a scatter of @xmath399 .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of the tully - fisher relation , the milky way is a typical galaxy .",
    "the decomposition of the milky way s rotation curve into the contributions from the stellar disk and the dark - matter halo in @xmath23  [ sec : fitresults ] has shown that the milky way s disk is maximal by the definition of @xcite .",
    "this appears to be in conflict with arguments based on the lack of correlation between tully - fisher velocity residuals and disk size for external galaxies @xcite , which have been used to argue against disks being maximal .",
    "however , whether this really shows that _ all _ disks are sub - maximal is far from clear , as dynamical modeling of gas kinematics in various galaxies and constraints from spiral structure have shown that some disks , especially those with @xmath400 , are maximal @xcite , while being consistent with the considerations of @xcite .",
    "measurements of the vertical velocity dispersions of external galaxies have been interpreted to indicate that disks are substantially sub - maximal ( e.g. , @xcite and more recently @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such measurements rely on the same dynamical principles as those employed in this paper s measurement , but these are much more difficult to apply in external galaxies without strong assumptions .",
    "it is essentially impossible to measure both the scale height and the vertical velocity dispersion for any individual external galaxy ; further the velocity dispersions obtained from integrated light do not trace the older , dynamically - relaxed stellar populations very well . as such , these measurements are afflicted with systematic uncertainties , which have not been sufficiently investigated .",
    "the fact that the milky way would appear substantially sub - maximal in the analysis of @xcite while the detailed dynamical modeling in this paper indicates otherwise may be a sign of these systematic uncertainties as a proxy for that of @xmath289 and use the latter as a proxy for the disk scale length .",
    "neither of these are good proxies in the milky way : in bo12c we measured the scale length of @xmath401 to be @xmath402 , which is much longer than that of @xmath289 found in @xmath23  [ sec : surfresults ] ; in this paper we find that the scale length of @xmath289 is significantly longer than that of @xmath403 .",
    "as @xcite use the scale length of @xmath401 to estimate galaxy disks central surface density @xmath404 , these effects lead one to underestimate @xmath404 and the maximality parameter of external disks . ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pizagno ] we compare our measurements of the milky way disk s properties to those derived from a sample of 81 disk - dominated galaxies from @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite in using the measurements of the disk scale lengths , stellar masses , and circular velocities at 2.2 disk scale lengths to derive the disk s contribution to the rotation curve at 2.2 disk scale lengths . in detail , we scale the stellar masses down by 20% to correct them for the presence of any bulge component and we lower the observed scale lengths by 10% as these scale lengths are measured from @xmath405 and @xmath169-band images , which are typically larger than the @xmath406-band scale length , which better traces the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the top panel shows that the milky way falls nicely within the stellar - mass  disk - maximality relation derived from the @xcite data .",
    "however , the milky way s scale length is quite different from that of external galaxies with similar stellar masses : for its stellar mass , the milky way would be expected to have scale length of @xmath407 , albeit it with a large scatter of @xmath368 ; this is clear from the color - coding of the points in the top panel of figure  [ fig : pizagno ] .",
    "following @xcite , we also consider the relation between the disk s surface density ( @xmath408 ) and the fraction of the circular velocity contributed by the disk .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pizagno ] .",
    "the short scale length that we measure for the milky way has the effect of putting the milky way at the upper edge of the observed surface densities , but the milky way still falls along the general trend determined by external galaxies .    therefore , if the milky way is atypical in any way , it is because of its short scale length .",
    "however , the mass - weighted scale length is only poorly measured for external galaxies , because variations in the mass - to - light ratio with radius may hamper the photometrically measured disk profiles .",
    "the analysis in this paper has used the properties of maps as measured in bo12  to justify modeling the maps as phase - mixed , steady - state stellar populations that lend themselves to simple dynamical models .",
    "this has worked well and all maps lead to a consistent measurement of the vertical mass distribution near the disk .",
    "the single - qdf - per - map  model provides a good fit to the spatial and kinematic properties of maps , as explicitly shown in the detailed comparisons between the data and the best - fit dynamical models in  [ sec : datamodel ] .",
    "thus , the maps are indeed well - described by the action - based qdf , as first proposed by @xcite , although with the caveat that we have not modeled the radial and azimuthal velocities .",
    "the fact that all maps can be described by the qdf adds further to the evidence that maps are simple dynamical building blocks of the ( local ) disk , as first proposed by bo12 .",
    "in particular the maps with scale heights and velocity dispersions intermediate between those of the canonical thin and thick disk are real dynamical populations .",
    "if these intermediate maps would have arisen because of abundance errors , as was already strongly argued against based on their observed spatial properties and kinematics in bo12 , we would not expect to be able to model them using a consistent dynamical model .",
    "for example , we would expect that the vertical profile measurements would be dominated by the stars in the thin component , while the dispersion measurements would be dominated by the stars in the thicker , kinematically - warmer component , which would strongly overestimate the surface density ( by a factor of 3 or more ) .",
    "the fact that this does not happen strongly argues that the intermediate maps are real , phase - mixed stellar populations in a dynamical steady state .",
    "in this paper we have used six - dimensional dynamical fitting employing three - action - based distribution functions , in order to model abundance - selected stellar populations from the segue survey , fully accounting for the selection function and deriving dynamical constraints while marginalizing over properties of the df .",
    "we have used this in particular to obtain a measurement of @xmath67  ( or @xmath246 ) at a single galactocentric radius for each map , thus dynamically measuring for the first time the radial profile of the surface density near the disk .",
    "these measurements are given in table  [ table : surf ] and they present stringent new constraints on the mass distribution in the inner milky way .    we have used these new measurements of @xmath247 in addition to ( weak ) existing measurements of the terminal velocity curve between @xmath164 and @xmath72 , the contribution of the disk to the local surface density , and the local slope of the rotation curve to constrain the gravitational potential between @xmath164 and @xmath165 . we find that our new measurements of @xmath247 provide the only dynamical constraint able to measure the dynamical ( mass - weighted ) disk scale length ; in combination with the other dynamical constraints we can measure the properties of the milky way s disk to great precision and find @xmath409 where @xmath410 includes the contributions from ordinary stellar matter , stellar remnants , and brown dwarfs and @xmath411 .",
    "we further find that @xmath412 the systematic uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in @xmath72 : increasing @xmath72 from our fiducial value of @xmath214 to @xmath340 increases the estimated masses by @xmath339 .",
    "the disk mass @xmath413 includes the mass of the stellar disk , @xmath414 , as well as the mass of the ism layer ; @xmath415 is the total baryonic mass of the milky way , including the stellar and ism disks and the bulge .",
    "these direct dynamical measurements of the stellar disk s properties are in good agreement with measurements derived from star counts , leaving little room for dark matter in a disk - like configuration . with a scale length this short , the milky way s disk",
    "is maximal by the definition of @xcite : we find that @xmath416 at 2.2 disk scale lengths .",
    "this paper s measurement of the disk mass will also be particularly valuable when measuring the dark halo s flattening from constraints on the potential at larger heights .",
    "for example , @xcite measured the total potential flattening at @xmath417 from the plane from fitting an orbit to the cold gd-1 stream , but found that the uncertainty in the mass of the disk did not allow for this to be turned into an interesting constraint on the halo s flattening .",
    "using our measurement of the disk mass , the gd-1 data indicate that the halo density flattening is @xmath418 , but it is clear that a more rigorous combination of these measurements and further progress in the dynamical fitting of tidal streams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are necessary to robustly measure the halo s flattening .",
    "these measurements of the disk s properties allow us to separate the contribution from the disk and the halo to the rotation curve , as shown in figure  [ fig : rotcurves ] .",
    "the halo does not contribute much to the milky way s rotation curve at @xmath364 . in turn",
    "this means that our constraints on the radial profile of the dark halo are relatively weak . nevertheless , these are the first dynamical constraints on the radial distribution of dark matter at @xmath364 and we find for a model @xmath419 that @xmath17 at 95% confidence ( where @xmath420 indicates that our measurement is based on dynamical data at @xmath421 ) .",
    "further measurements of the vertical mass distribution ( e.g. , @xmath422 at @xmath423 and @xmath424 ) would significantly improve this constraint .",
    "the dynamical modeling performed in this paper is complex , computationally expensive , and currently limited to exploring only a few parameters of the gravitational potential .",
    "it provides a full generative modeling framework in which selection effects , observational uncertainties , nuisance parameters , outlier models , and other data issues can be naturally included using a likelihood - based approach .",
    "we have dealt with the computational complexity by focusing our efforts on the measurement of a single dynamical constraint derived from each dynamical sub - sample of stellar tracers ( maps ) : the vertical force at @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is clear that the fitting procedure to each map  can yield much more information than this . in particular ,",
    "each sub - sample could be used to also measure the vertical profile of the vertical force within the segue sample s spatial volume , which should lead to better constraints on the radial profile of the dark - matter halo .",
    "ultimately , this is what is required for the optimal analysis of gaia data .",
    "the analysis in this paper has demonstrated 3d , 3-action dynamical modeling of disk populations using observations of individual stars in the context of a real data set with all of the complexities of a non - trivial selection function and data uncertainties .",
    "but it is clear that further development of this technique , especially in more efficiently exploring the dynamical pdf , is necessary before the gaia data arrive .",

    "the alternative models slightly overestimate or underestimate the width of the distribution , depending on whether their disk is too heavy or too light . from figures  [ fig : datamodel_zdist_aenhanced ] and [ fig : datamodel_vzdist_aenhanced ] it is clear that the number - count measurements are the most informative , such that the dynamical fit works essentially as follows : ( a ) for a given potential , the qdf parameters are adjusted to match the observed number counts without regard as to whether the vertical velocities are fit well ; ( b ) the best - fitting potential is the one for which these qdf parameters also fit the vertical velocity distribution .",
    "this is essentially the same procedure that was used more explicitly by @xcite .",
    "figure  s  [ fig : datamodel_zdist_aintermediate ] and [ fig : datamodel_vzdist_aintermediate ] show similar comparisons for the intermediate maps .",
    "these demonstrate that the vertical number counts are matched well , although with a slight overprediction of the scale height around @xmath439 .",
    "heavier and lighter disks ( with changes to @xmath67  around @xmath440 for intermediate maps ) again predict almost the same vertical profile .",
    "figure  [ fig : datamodel_vzdist_aintermediate ] shows that the distribution of vertical velocities as a function of height is excellently fit by the best - fit dynamical model ; the predictions of the heavier and lighter disks are obviously ruled out for these populations .",
    "finally , figure  s  [ fig : datamodel_zdist_apoor ] and [ fig : datamodel_vzdist_apoor ] show data  model comparisons for the @xmath192-young  populations , split only into two radial and vertical bins here because only about @xmath441 stars have @xmath37 } } > -0.1{\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{dex}}}$ ] in our selection of the segue g - type dwarfs .",
    "the comparison is therefore not as fine - grained as for the @xmath192-old  and intermediate divisions , but the correspondence between the data and the model are similar as for the other divisions : the vertical number - count profiles are predicted to be similar for the best - fit potential and the heavier- and lighter - disk alternative models ; the distribution of the vertical velocities clearly prefers the best - fit model over the alternatives .",
    "the fact that both the vertical number counts and the distribution of vertical velocities is matched in detail by our 3-action based qdf model proves that a description of these populations as dynamically - relaxed populations makes sense .",
    "however , the detailed comparison of the vertical number - counts of the best - fit dynamical model and the data for all three sub - divisions shows a slight underprediction of the number counts at @xmath442 and @xmath443 , which is likely due to substructure that is not captured by our model . clearly ,",
    "investigation of the residuals from the best - fit dynamical models for maps in the future will be useful for determining the fine - grained orbital structure of maps , which may contain traces of dynamical or accreted substructures .",
