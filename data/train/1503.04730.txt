    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze the ring structure of @xmath11 and construct an explicit basis of @xmath11 canonically associated to a generic component @xmath17 of the moment map @xmath18 ( see page ) .",
    "the restrictions of the basis elements to the fixed points , i.e. their images in @xmath16 , determine the equivariant structure constants .",
    "a result of kirwan guarantees that there always exists a basis for @xmath11 associated to a generic component of the moment map , the elements of this basis being called _ kirwan classes _ ( see @xcite for the equivariant cohomology setting , and proposition [ existence kirwan ] for a generalization of this idea to equivariant k - theory ) .",
    "this basis is , however , not unique .",
    "several authors have added different conditions that would ensure this basis to be unique , i.e. to be _ canonically _ associated to a generic component of the moment map .",
    "for example , guillemin and zara @xcite study this problem for the equivariant cohomology ring of _ gkm spaces _",
    "( see section [ gkm section ] ) .",
    "the elements of the basis they introduce are called equivariant thom classes , and should be thought of as the  equivariant poincar duals \" to the closures of the unstable manifolds @xmath19 of a generic component @xmath17 of the moment map with respect to an invariant metric . when such closures are smooth , these equivariant poincar duals can be computed explicitly in terms of the @xmath7 representations on the normal bundle of @xmath20 .",
    "however in general such manifolds are not smooth , and in this case the restrictions of the equivariant thom classes to the fixed point set are analyzed by means of the combinatorics of the gkm graph . in @xcite goldin and tolman study a similar problem on hamiltonian @xmath7-spaces , and introduce basis elements for the equivariant cohomology ring which are canonically associated to a generic component @xmath17 of the moment map .",
    "however in both cases , in order for the basis elements to exist and be unique , there is an essential requirement on @xmath17 : it needs to be _ index increasing _",
    "( see definition [ ii and nii ] ) .",
    "this is satisfied for example when the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath17 with respect to an invariant metric meet transversally .",
    "in @xcite guillemin and kogan introduce equivariant k - theory classes which are a basis of the equivariant k - theory ring @xmath21 of a hamiltonian @xmath7-space ( as a module over the equivariant k - theory of a point ) .",
    "however no explicit connection is given between such basis and the  natural \" basis given by the k - theoretical equivariant poincar duals to the closures of the unstable manifolds ( in the case in which there exists an invariant metric for which these are all smooth ) .",
    "to express the extra conditions imposed on kirwan classes , guillemin and kogan introduce the _ local index map _ , that associates to each class in @xmath21 and each fixed point @xmath22 an element of @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath23 can be identified with @xmath24 , the representation ring of @xmath7 .",
    "inspired by this idea , we present a slightly different definition of local index of an equivariant k - theory class @xmath25 at a fixed point @xmath26 @xmath27 and give an explicit combinatorial recipe for computing it ( see definition [ definition local index ] in section [ section local index ] ) . using this notion we introduce a basis for the equivariant k - theory ring of a symplectic toric manifold @xmath0 which is canonically associated to a generic component of the moment map , both in the index increasing and non - index increasing case .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following .",

    "we prove the claims of the above theorem in two separate propositions : uniqueness is proved in proposition [ uniqueness ] , existence in proposition [ existence canonical ] .",
    "moreover , we show that in the index increasing case these classes are indeed the equivariant poincar duals to the flow - up manifolds @xmath28 ( see lemma [ def kirwanclasses ] and prop .  [ classes from cohomology are canonical ] ) .",
    "note that we require our classes @xmath45 to have local index @xmath46 on @xmath28 , not only at @xmath30 as in @xcite . as a consequence , the trivial bundle @xmath47 is an element of our basis of i - canonical classes , while it does not belong to the basis exhibited in @xcite .",
    "moreover , when @xmath0 is a complex projective space endowed with the standard toric action , the basis of i - canonical classes consists of powers of the ( equivariant ) prequantization line bundle ( see example [ projective space ] ) .",
    "another important advantage of our approach is that the local index , and thus also the i - canonical classes , is easy to calculate directly from the combinatorics underlying the symplectic toric manifold , as we demonstrate by various examples .",
    "we give explicit formulas for the elements of this basis when the component of the moment map is index increasing , and inductive formulas otherwise .",
