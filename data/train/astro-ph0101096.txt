    "the study of the parsec scale properties of radio galaxies is crucial to obtain information on the nature of their central engine , and provides the basis of the current _ unified theories _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which suggest that the appearance of active galactic nuclei strongly depends on orientation . in the _ high - luminosity unified scheme _ , quasars and powerful radio galaxies ( fr ii , @xcite )",
    "are suggested to be the same class of objects but seen at different viewing angles .",
    "similarly , the _ low - luminosity unified scheme _ assumes bl - lacs to be the beamed population of radio galaxies of low - intermediate luminosity ( fr i ) .    to get new insight in the study of radio galaxies at pc resolution",
    ", we undertook a project of observations of a complete sample of radio galaxies selected from the b2 and 3cr catalogs @xcite . since both catalogs have been selected at low frequencies , the source properties are dominated by the unbeamed extended emission and are not affected by observational biases related to orientation effects .    in the appendix we present new images and data for 12 galaxies of our sample and give short notes reviewing also published results .",
    "after 10 years high quality images and data are available for all sources in the sample , so that we can derive and discuss general properties of the whole sample .",
    "we will use here a hubble constant h@xmath1 = 50 km sec@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and a deceleration parameter q@xmath1 = 0.5 ( note that different cosmological constants have been used in previous papers on the same sample ) .",
    "in table 1 we give the list of radio galaxies .",
    "the complete sample @xcite , consisting of 27 radio galaxies from the b2 and 3cr catalogs , satisfies the following criteria :    declination @xmath3 10@xmath4    galactic latitude b @xmath3 15 @xmath4    arc - second core flux density at 5 ghz ( s@xmath5 )  @xmath6 100 mjy    apparent visual magnitude of the associated galaxy m@xmath7 @xmath8 20 , for 3cr sources .    with respect to the original list presented in @xcite",
    ", we give a more accurate flux density measurement of the core at arc - second resolution , when available , to minimize the contamination from the jet(s ) flux density .",

    "we are aware that it results in a selection effect in favor of objects with a beamed core i.e. oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight . despite this effect ,",
    "the sample is dominated by low - intermediate power fr i radio galaxies and by extended steep spectrum fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "the vlbi study of a sample selected without any restrictions on the core flux density is in progress .    in fig .",
    "1 we show a plot of the observed core power versus total radio power for the present sample . the line represents the correlation found by @xcite . as expected from the core flux density selection effect , most of present sources have a core radio power higher than average with respect to their total radio power .",
    "we will use the available observational data to constrain the jet velocity and orientation for all the sources of our sample . in the following we briefly summarize the methods used .",
    "other methods are possible e.g. the x - ray non thermal nuclear emission could be used to derive a possible doppler factor according to the synchrotron - self - compton model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , they do not give significant limits because of the large uncertainties in the available data .",
    "assuming that the jets are intrinsically symmetric , the jet velocity ( @xmath9c ) and orientation ( @xmath10 ) , can be constrained from the jet to counter jet brightness ratio r , according to the formula    r = ( 1 + @xmath9 cos@xmath10)@xmath11 ( 1 - @xmath9 cos@xmath10)@xmath12    we assume a jet spectral index @xmath13 = 0.5 with s@xmath14 .",
    "the validity of this formula depends on the degree of isotropy of the intrinsic synchrotron emissivity in the jets .",
    "here we assume that the parsec scale jet emissivity is isotropic ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "@xcite found a general correlation between the core and total radio power in radio galaxies . since the total radio power was measured at low frequency and is therefore not affected by doppler boosting , the core emission derived by the total radio power is not boosted . assuming that sources are oriented at random angles the best fit value corresponds to the average orientation angle ( 60@xmath4 ) and the observed dispersion of the core radio power around the best fit line reflects the different orientation angles ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we can use this correlation to derive the expected intrinsic core radio power from the total galaxy radio power and , comparing it with the observed core radio power , to estimate the source orientation .",
    "here we have re - analyzed the correlation given in @xcite to take into account new better quality data of the core flux density at 5 ghz .",
    "moreover , we added the radio quasars with the same selection criteria used for radio galaxies , since all sources with @xmath10 in the range 0@xmath4 - 90@xmath4 should be included , to derive the correct correlation .",
    "the new correlation ( scaled for the different cosmological constants used here ) is very similar to the previous one :    log p@xmath5 = ( 0.62@xmath150.04 ) log p@xmath16 + ( 7.6 @xmath15 1.1 )    where p@xmath5 is the arc - second core radio power at 5 ghz and p@xmath16 is the total radio power at 408 mhz . to take into account the core variability , we have allowed the core flux density to vary within a factor of two from the measured one .",
    "proper motion is detected in 7 sources , for which we can derive the apparent velocity @xmath17  c. from this value we can constrain the intrinsic jet velocity and orientation as follows :    @xmath9 = @xmath17/(@xmath17 cos @xmath10 + sin",
    "@xmath10 )    .    in this paper",
    "we will assume that the jet bulk velocity and the pattern velocity have comparable values ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in table 2 and figures 2 and 3 , we give for each source the estimated range of the jet velocity and orientation with respect to the line of sight derived from the methods previously discussed .",

    "in the present sample , there are 13 fr i radio galaxies : one ( 3c338 ) shows a clear two - sided structure , three show a short counter - jet ( ngc 315 , 3c66b , and 1144 + 35 ) , and nine have a one - sided morphology",

    "however , 1144 + 35 shows intermediate properties between fr i sources and bl - lac type objects @xcite and 3c 274 is a peculiar source ( see sect .",
    "two sources ( ngc 315 and 3c 66b ) show evidence of an accelerating jet near the core ( 1 - 5 parsec ; see appendix ) .",
    "parsec scale jets are always collimated near the core ( with the exception of 3c  274 , @xcite ) and appear rather uniform in brightness , with the presence of possible jet substructures at any distance from the core . in 3c  274",
    "it is well known that the jet appears limb - brightened ; a similar structure is visible in 1144 + 35 at about 20 pc from the core ( projected ) .",
    "we can not exclude that a limb - brightened morphology could be present in a larger number of sources , but higher sensitivity and higher resolution data are necessary to reveal it ( see sect .",

    "we find evidence of a limb - brightened jet structure in this distant region ; in 3c 264 the jet is well collimated and narrow up to @xmath19 100 pc and it shows a strong widening , filaments and a possible helical structure at a larger distance from the core . at a shorter distance from the core ( 1 to 50 pc ) we have in all cases centrally peaked jets , except 3c  274 . in a few cases (",
    "see e.g. 3c  66b ) there is a sharp change in the jet brightness , but no critical scale was found . only for a few sources",
    "can we obtain images on linear scales smaller than 1 pc . in these cases , we see a collimated , centrally peaked jet with the exception of 3c  274 . in this source ,",
    "an extended jet emission is visible , possibly related to the collimation process .",
    "a strong collimation of the jet occurs on apparent scales -1.1em 0.04 pc from the central engine ( see @xcite ) .      among the fr",
    "ii sources , one shows a symmetric two - sided structure ( 3c452 ) while five have a one - sided jet ( 3c109 , 3c303 , 3c346 , 3c382 , and 3c390.3 ) .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with the unified scheme model predictions , because 3c452 the only narrow line fr ii galaxy in our sample , while other fr ii galaxies are well known broad line radio galaxies .",
    "the main jet in the pc scale image is always on the same side with respect to the core as the main kpc scale jet , and the jet position angles are in agreement within a few degrees .",
    "this is expected if the jet asymmetry present in fr ii radio galaxies is due to the doppler effect in jets moving at relativistic velocities in the pc and kpc scale .",
    "comparing parsec scale jets in fr i and fr ii sources we note that in our images fr i jets show a uniform brightness when observed with a good uv - coverage , while fr ii jets show a structure characterized by the presence of a few blobs .",
    "this difference is difficult to quantify and could be related to a difference in the jet properties .",
    "we exclude that it could be an effect due to the _ clean _ procedure and poor uv - coverage , since the three fr ii images presented here for the first time were obtained with an array of 17 telescopes ( see appendix ) .",
    "no evidence of a larger jet velocity in fr ii than in fr i sources is present in our data ( see fig .",
    "the compact sources there include two bl - lac type objects ( mkn 421 and mkn 501 ) , four low power compact sources ( lpc : 0222 + 36 , 0331 + 39 , 0648 + 27 , and 1217 + 29 ) , one compact symmetric object ( 0116 + 31 ) and one compact steep spectrum source ( 0258 + 35 ) .    the two bl - lacs show high velocity pc - scale jets oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight . in mkn 421 we see a complex jet with no evidence of a limb - brightened structure whereas in mkn 501 a limb - brightened jet is well visible at @xmath19 50 pc from the core ( de - projected ) .    in two lpc sources there is evidence of fast jets oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight . in one case ( 0331 + 39 ) the jet is visible for more than 50 pc and could be limb - brightened starting at about 15 pc from the core ( de - projected ) . in 0222 + 36",
    "no jet was detected , but the core dominance suggests a source orientation at a small angle with respect to the line of sight and some relativistic boosting due to a relativistic jet not visible in our images .",
    "the evidence of relativistic jets oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight and the absence of an extended structure at arc - second resolution , suggests that these sources could be classified as intermediate or low power bl - lac sources whose observed core power is too low to dominate the optical emission and therefore are classified as galaxies .",
    "we remember that lpc sources do not have a steep radio spectrum .",
    "ngc 4278 shows diffuse emission on a linear scale smaller than 1 pc .",
    "all the radio emission is confined within this small size source .",
    "no jet like structure is clearly visible and no constraint can be given on the source orientation .",
    "more observations are necessary to properly discuss this source .",
    "for the cso and css source we refer to the comments given in the appendix .",
    "there are several strong and widely accepted lines of evidences for the existence of relativistic bulk velocities in the parsec scale jets of radio galaxies : the observed super - luminal motions , the rapid variabilities , the observed high brightness temperatures , the absence of strong inverse - compton emission in the x - ray and the detection of a high frequency emission ( gamma ray ) for the two bl - lacs mkn 421 and 501 all seem to require relativistic bulk speeds with lorentz factor ( @xmath0 ) -1.1em 3 .",
    "the results , discussed in the previous sections , confirm that radio jets move at high velocities on the mas scale .",
    "since in many cases we can only give a lower limit to @xmath0 , to better investigate this point we assumed different @xmath0 values and we tested if the derived source properties were in agreement with the observational data .",
    "once a jet velocity is assumed , the jet orientation is constrained by the observational data and it is possible to compute the corresponding doppler factor @xmath20 ( @xmath20 = ( @xmath21 for each source ( in table 3 we present the estimated orientation angle and doppler factor ranges assuming @xmath0 = 5 ) .",
    "then , from the value of @xmath20 and of the measured radio power , we can derive the intrinsic core radio power for each source : p@xmath22 = p@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 ( assuming @xmath13 = 0 ) . in table 4",

    "this source would agree with the correlation displayed in fig .",
    "4 with a doppler factor @xmath19 1 , which would imply a jet orientation in the range 35@xmath440@xmath4 and not smaller than 19@xmath4 .",
    "such a value is in contrast with the high super - luminal motion found with optical data ( see the discussion in @xcite ) unless a high jet velocity ( @xmath0 @xmath3 12 ) is assumed ( see @xcite ) . even taking into account that most of the total radio power in 3c 274 at low frequency is due to the large extended halo emission ,",
    "whose origin and relation with the core radio power is poorly understood ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and that therefore the total radio power to be used in the correlation should be probably much lower , the large discrepancy between 3c 274 and the other sources persists .",

    "the total energy ( u@xmath28 ) in the radio source lobes is :    u@xmath28 @xmath29 p@xmath30 @xmath24 v@xmath31    @xcite where v is the source volume and p@xmath28 is the lobe radio power .    assuming that the global energy is proportional to the energy carried out by the jets and that the lobe radio power is the total radio power at 408 mhz , we can derive that :    p@xmath5 @xmath29 p@xmath32 @xmath24 v@xmath31/t    where t is the radio source age .",
    "the result , p@xmath5 @xmath29 p@xmath33 , is very similar to the slope computed from the core ",
    "total radio power correlation ( 0.62 ) .",
    "the time dependence is too low to be relevant if we take into account that the source volume is proportional to t@xmath34 with _ a _ @xmath19 3 resulting in a final time dependence of t@xmath35 and that most of the sources used to derive the correlation between the core and total radio power are old sources .",
    "the small dispersion found and the estimated correlation persists if sources are not too far from the equipartition condition .      the differences in the kpc scale between fr i and fr ii sources are well known and established .",
    "the most relevant difference related to the present discussion is the evidence that kpc scale jets in fr ii sources are still relativistic or mildly relativistic up to the hot spot region , while kpc scale jets in fr i sources are strongly decelerated and become sub - relativistic within 1 - 5 kpc from the core , with typical velocities of a few thousands km / sec .    in this paper",
    "we show that parsec scale jets are highly relativistic in fr i and fr ii sources .",
    "therefore the difference between fr i and fr ii sources on the kpc scale are not related to the parsec scale velocity , but to a larger scale effect .",
    "two different scenarios can be considered :    \\a ) fr ii sources have a higher intrinsic jet power which can maintain relativistic jets up to the hot spot region ;",
    "\\b ) fr i sources have a higher density interstellar medium which decelerates the jets .",
    "the first case implies a correlation between the total or core radio power of fr ii sources and the jet velocity , and therefore jets in fr i should have on average a lower @xmath0 value .",
    "this is not the case from present results , where no difference in the jet velocity has been found in fr i and in fr ii sources .",
    "moreover the correlation between the core and total radio power does not show any difference among fr i and fr ii sources .",
    "if fr ii sources have higher velocity jets we should see some discontinuity in the core - radio power correlation going from low to high powers .",
    "if the interstellar medium ( ism ) in fr i is denser than in fr ii , we should see : i ) lower polarized flux and higher rotation measure in fr i than in fr ii , if the ism is ionized . in ngc",
    "315 @xcite found a very deep limit in the polarized flux density , but data are missing for a comparison between fr i and fr ii sources .",
    "ii ) fr i jets should show a more prominent limb - brightening structure with respect to fr ii sources because of a larger interaction with the surrounding medium . as discussed in the next sub - section ,",
    "the few sources with an evident limb - brightened jet structure on the parsec scale are low power ( fr i ) radio galaxies or bl - lac type sources .    in conclusion",
    ", our results do not support the idea that large scale differences between fr i and fr ii sources are due to intrinsically more powerful and faster parsec scale jets in fr ii sources .",
    "there is evidence that the jet velocity in fr i sources slowly , but continuously , decreases because of the jet interaction with a dense ism , and becomes sub ",
    "relativistic on the kpc scale .",
    "@xcite derive that a structure in the jet velocity field , with a fast spine surrounded by a slow velocity layer , is necessary to account for the discrepancies among observational data for fr i radio galaxies and bl - lac objects .",
    "a two - velocity jet model was developed by @xcite and supported by observational evidence in some fr i sources . in a two velocity jet , seen at a significant angle to the jet ,",
    "the emission from the inner portion of the jet is strongly de - boosted , making it weak to invisible .",
    "in contrast , the outer , slower portions of the jet have lower doppler de - boosting and therefore may appear brighter .",
    "such a jet if observed at proper resolution , would appear as a hollow cone , i.e. limb - brightened .    in our sample",
    "a limb - brightened structure is clearly present in 3c  274 , 1144 + 35 and mkn 501 and could be present in 0331 + 39 .",
    "we note that the detection of such structure may not be easy : it should be well visible in polarized images ( see @xcite for mkn 501 ) which are difficult to obtain because of the low percentage of polarized flux ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while good angular resolution and high sensitivity are needed in total intensity images . moreover to distinguish the two velocity regions a critical orientation is crucial to have the low velocity external region brighter because of doppler beaming and the inner fast region fainter because it is de - boosted .",
    "this is the case of 1144 + 35 and mkn 501 .",
    "we also note that the two velocity structure is not visible at the jet beginning , but at some distance from the core .",
    "we interpret this as evidence of the presence of an interaction between the jet and the external medium , i.e. the outer layer velocity decreases because of the interaction with the surrounding medium , and this deceleration becomes significant at some distance from the core .",
    "the de - projected distance , where the shear layer is visible , is about 50 pc for 1144 + 35 and mkn 501 , and 2030 pc for 0331 + 39 , where it could be present .",
    "this suggests that jet imaging in the sub - arcsecond scale ( i.e. 50  100 pc ) is likely to be best suited for the detection of limb - brightened structures .",
    "most of our images can track the milliarcsecond jets only out to a few parsecs and only for mkn 421 and 3c 264 high quality images from a few pc to hundreds of parsecs are available , with no evidence for limb - brightening .",
    "both sources have a complex morphology because of projection effects and jet sub - structures .",
    "we conclude that a two  velocity structure in parsec scale jets is present in a few sources , but with the available data we can not confirm if this kind of structure is present in all sources or only in some of them because of different jet interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "future observations with the extended vla will solve this point .",
    "in this paper we presented new images at parsec resolution for 10 galaxies ( see appendix ) , and maps at different frequencies for 2 more sources . thanks to these new data",
    "at least one high quality image at parsec resolution is available for all the sources of our sample .",
    "fr i radio sources are characterized by the presence of highly relativistic parsec scale jets , whose orientation with respect to the line of sight , is in agreement with the predictions of unified scheme models .",
    "fr ii sources have a radio morphology very similar to fr i radio galaxies and jet velocities are in the same range .",
    "a new symmetric two - sided jet was found in the narrow line fr ii radio galaxy 3c 452 .",
    "lpc sources show relativistic jets at a small angle to the line of sight .",
    "we suggest that most of lpc sources are intermediate bl - lacs where the observed nuclear emission is too faint to be dominant with respect to the parent galaxy radiation because of the intermediate jet orientation angle and/or the faint nuclear power .    assuming different jet velocities , we derived the corresponding intrinsic core radio power , and we correlated it with the low frequency total radio power .",
    "we found that the core to total radio power ratio is in very good agreement with the correlation derived from the analysis of b2 and 3cr catalogs assuming a jet bulk speed in the range @xmath0 = 3  10 .",
    "the dispersion around the best fit is small as expected since we have removed the differences due to the orientation angle .",
    "this result confirms that sources with different kpc scale morphology and radio power , are similar on the parsec scale .",
    "the slope of the correlation is in agreement with the expected value from equipartition conditions .",
    "the similarity of radio morphology and jet velocity on the parsec scale is in contrast with the large difference on the kpc scale between high and low power radio sources .",
    "we briefly discussed the reason of this difference , and suggested that it could be due to a denser ism in low power radio sources .",
    "a strong interaction between the relativistic jet and the surrounding medium can produce a decrease of the jet velocity and therefore fr i jets will become sub - relativistic after a few hundreds of parsecs and sub  relativistic within a few kiloparsecs .",
    "conversely , jets in fr ii sources are mildly relativistic up to the hot spot region . a systematic higher @xmath0 value in fr ii sources is excluded by the present data",
    ".    a decrease in the jet velocity in low power sources should give rise to different morphological properties in parsec scale images .",
    "one major difference could be the presence of a two velocity regime in low power source jets responsible of the limb - brightened structures .",
    "we discussed the difficulty to image such jet structure and we noted that the few sources with a limb - brightened structure are low power sources .",
    "this could be evidence of the interaction between the jet and the ism producing a jet deceleration in low power sources .",
