    "we do not know how and when luminous elliptical galaxies were assembled .",
    "traditional models assume that all ellipticals are @xmath10 years old , having experienced very little mass evolution after their initial collapse ( e.g. , searle , sargent , & bagnuolo 1973 ) . in contrast , galaxy formation models in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies predict that massive galaxies were assembled in many generations of mergers , and ellipticals experienced their last major mergers at @xmath11 ( kauffmann 1996 ; baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "ideally , the evolution of the mass function is determined directly from mass measurements .",
    "an alternative approach is to determine the evolution of the merger fraction with redshift .",
    "mergers in present - day rich clusters are rare because the probability of a low velocity encounter is small . if cluster ellipticals formed in mergers these must have occurred before or during the initial collapse of the cluster ( roos & aarseth 1982 ; merritt 1984 ) .",
    "morphological studies of intermediate redshift clusters have shown that mergers were indeed more common at earlier times ( lavery & henry 1988 [ lh88 ] ; lavery , pierce , & mcclure 1992 [ lpm92 ] ; dressler et al .",
    "1994 [ d94 ] ; couch et al .",
    "1998 [ c98 ] ) .",
    "these studies indicate merger fractions of @xmath12% in clusters at @xmath13 .",
    "however , since these mergers are generally blue and of low luminosity they are probably not very massive ( e.g. , c98 ) . furthermore , dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that disturbed galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters are generally disrupted disks rather than major mergers .",
    "these results indicate that massive cluster ellipticals were assembled at even higher redshift .",
    "recently it has become possible to extend morphological studies of rich clusters to @xmath14 ( e.g. , lubin et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this _ letter _ , we present results from a large area survey of the x - ray selected cluster 054 at @xmath0 .",
    "we determine the merger fraction using an @xmath15 selected sample of 81 confirmed cluster members covered by a large hst wfpc2 mosaic .",
    "we assume @xmath16mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the 054 field was observed with lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10 m keck ii telescope .",
    "objects were selected on the basis of their @xmath15 band magnitude in a @xmath20 diameter aperture ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "these magnitudes were measured from a 900s keck image , with @xmath22 seeing .",
    "spectra were taken through six multi - slit masks on 1998 february 28 and march 1 .",
    "the slit masks were designed to maximize the observed number of galaxies with @xmath23 in the area covered by our hst imaging .",
    "typical exposure times were 2400s .",
    "a cross - correlation program was used to determine redshifts for 186 galaxies ; 80 are cluster members . within the area covered by our hst imaging",
    "the completeness of our sample is 73% to @xmath24 .",
    "the new redshifts were combined with samples of donahue et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and tran et al .",
    "( 1999 ) giving a total of 89 confirmed cluster members .",
    "we obtained a large hst wfpc2 mosaic of 054 , consisting of six independent pointings in two filters ( f606w and f814w ) .",
    "integration times were 6500s in each passband and at each position .",
    "81 confirmed cluster members are located within the hst mosaic .",
    "accurate magnitudes and colors were determined from the wfpc2 images .",
    "morphological classifications of the spectroscopically confirmed members were performed by pvd , mf , and df , using the f814w images ( restframe @xmath25 ) . the classification methods and details of our survey",
    "are described in van dokkum ( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that it is difficult to distinguish ellipticals from s0s , even at low redshift ( e.g. , jrgensen & franx 1994 ) .",
    "the most surprising result of our survey is the high fraction of galaxies classified as `` merger / peculiar '' .",
    "we classified @xmath2% as mergers , compared to @xmath26% ellipticals , @xmath26% s0s , and @xmath27% spirals .",
    "merging galaxies are counted as one object .",
    "images of the mergers are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "the mergers display a variety of features : double nuclei ( e.g. , 997 ) , tidal tails ( e.g. , 1760 ) , and interacting doubles with distorted morphologies ( e.g. , 1340 ) .",
    "we emphasize that all classified galaxies , including the mergers , are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members .",
    "the merger fraction of 17% is significantly higher than in lower redshift clusters , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1a the mergers extend to high luminosities : five of the sixteen brightest galaxies were classified as mergers .",
    "only seven out of sixteen were classified as ellipticals or s0s , two of which ( 1584 and 710 ) have a luminous companion within 2050minkpc .",
    "the median luminosity of the mergers is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 at @xmath0 ) .",
    "the majority of the mergers will probably evolve into elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 , barnes 1998 ) , thereby increasing the number fraction of massive ellipticals at later times",
    ". however , not all mergers form ellipticals .",
    "simulations indicate that disks can survive mergers between galaxies of very different mass ( barnes 1998 ) , and so some mergers may evolve into s0s ( e.g. , galaxy 1583 ) .",
    "most mergers show no evidence for the presence of gas to form a new disk : only 15% of the mergers have ew 727@xmath30 .",
    "the merger fraction is remarkably high , given the short timescale for the merging process ( @xmath31gyr ; e.g. , rix & white 1989 ) . from the fact that the merger fraction is similar to the elliptical fraction we estimate that @xmath5% of present - day cluster ellipticals ( and probably a small fraction of s0s ) were assembled in mergers at @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that a significant fraction of cluster ellipticals have undergone major structural change at @xmath11 .",
    "a possible concern is that some of the mergers are misclassified .",
    "several show two galaxies separated by @xmath32 ( 1050minkpc ) in a common envelope without obvious tidal features ( e.g. , galaxies 997 and 1163 ) .",
    "one could argue that these objects are not bound , but chance projections along the line of sight .",
    "we have calculated the probability of chance projections from simulated galaxy distributions , by randomizing the position angles of galaxies with respect to the bcg and north .",
    "the expected number of galaxy pairs with separations @xmath33 is smaller than one .",
    "furthermore , both galaxies of most merging pairs were placed in the @xmath34 wide slits .",
    "no double peaks were seen in the cross - correlation functions , implying @xmath35 for the brightest merging pairs .",
    "both arguments are strong evidence that the galaxies are bound , and that we are witnessing mergers in progress .",
    "the merger fraction in 054 is surprisingly high , given the high velocity dispersion of the cluster ( @xmath36 ; tran et al.1999 ) .",
    "since the progenitors of the mergers must have had low relative velocities , the mergers are probably taking place in cold subclumps which are falling into the cluster .",
    "this is supported by the spatial distribution of the mergers , shown in fig .",
    "[ spatial.plot ] .",
    "the mergers occur preferentially in the outskirts of the cluster , consistent with recent infall .",
    "we note that the spatial distribution of the mergers is strong aposteriori evidence against chance projections .",
    "furthermore , the cluster itself is irregular and elongated , as indicated by the iso - density contours in fig .",
    "[ spatial.plot ] and the x - ray distribution ( donahue et al .",
    "our data suggest that the cluster consists of three clumps at the same radial velocity .",
    "we infer that the mergers are possible because the cluster is viewed before final virialization , and hence before stripping of the halos of infalling subclumps .",
    "in most cases the merging galaxies are bulge - dominated , red , and have no detected 727 emission . hence , they are mergers between ellipticals , s0s or sas . the most striking examples of these gas poor mergers are galaxies 997 and 1163 .",
    "in contrast to mergers in the nearby field ( liu & kennicutt 1995 ) , the star formation rate is very low , although several galaxies have enhanced balmer lines indicating a modest recent star burst .",
    "a major puzzle is how and when the progenitors of the mergers lost their gas .",
    "the ages of the mergers relative to the other cluster galaxies can be estimated from their location in the color - magnitude diagram ( fig.[cm.plot ] ) .",
    "mergers are indicated with @xmath37 symbols .",
    "the median color of the mergers is modestly bluer ( by @xmath38 magnitudes in @xmath39 ) than the cm relation defined by the early - type galaxies , indicating their luminosity weighted ages are @xmath40% lower ( worthey 1994 ) . assuming that galaxies on the cm relation formed their stars at @xmath41 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "1998b ) , the stars in the mergers have a luminosity weighted mean formation redshift @xmath7 .",
    "we conclude that the mean stellar ages of present - day cluster ellipticals are much larger than the ages of their last major mergers .",
    "we note in passing that only three of the mergers satisfy the butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) criteria for a blue galaxy . assuming @xmath42 ( worthey 1994 ) we find the blue fraction in 054 is @xmath43% ; @xmath44% of the blue galaxies are spirals .",
    "we test whether the colors of the mergers are consistent with measurements of the scatter in the cm relation at @xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the cm relation of the existing es and e / s0s at @xmath0 is low at @xmath45 in restframe @xmath39 , consistent with the results of stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for other high redshift clusters .",
    "the scatter in the combined sample of ellipticals and mergers ( i.e. , the sample of _ future _ ellipticals ) is much higher , at @xmath46 .",
    "this scatter will decrease at later times , because fractional age differences between galaxies will be smaller ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "we have evolved the cm relation forward in time using the simple models presented in van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , and find that the @xmath39 scatter in the cm relation of ellipticals and mergers will be @xmath47 at @xmath48 , and only @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the observed scatter in the cm relation at low and intermediate redshift ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al .  1997 ; stanford et al .  1998 ;",
    "van dokkum et al .",
    "the large number of mergers in 054 implies strong evolution in the merger fraction from @xmath50 to @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[evorate.plot ] , which shows the evolution of the merger fraction in rich clusters with redshift .",
    "solid symbols are cl1358 + 62 at @xmath51 and 054 at @xmath0 .",
    "we determined the merger fraction in cl1358 + 62 from a sample of 194 confirmed cluster members imaged with wfpc2 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "the merger fraction in this cluster can be compared directly to that in 054 , since the sample selection , field size ( in mpc ) and classification method are identical .",
    "merger fractions for other rich clusters were estimated from the literature ; in order of increasing redshift from dressler ( 1980 ) , lh88 , c98 , lpm92 , and d94 .",
    "these merger fractions are based on ground based imaging of blue galaxies ( lh88 , lpm92 ) or visual classifications of hst images ( d94 , c98 ) .",
    "the evolution of the merger rate can be parameterized by @xmath52 .",
    "we find @xmath53 .",
    "the best fit is indicated with the solid line .",
    "it is interesting to compare the evolution of the merger fraction in clusters to that in the field .",
    "the broken line in fig.[evorate.plot ] is a fit to the fraction of field galaxies in close pairs , from patton et al .",
    "a direct comparison with the cluster data is difficult because the latter are based on visual classifications , which include both close pairs and merger remnants .",
    "we note , however , that these fractions are comparable in the outer parts of 054 .",
    "although the normalisation is uncertain , the _ rate _ of evolution can be compared directly . both the cluster environment and the field show strong evolution . the evolution in clusters might even be stronger than in the field",
    "this result is mainly driven by the very low merger fraction in low redshift clusters .",
    "the rapid evolution in the cluster environment could be due to an enhanced accretion rate onto clusters at high redshift , and/or enhanced merging during the collapse of massive clusters .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the merger fraction correlates with the dynamical state of clusters .",
    "the increase with redshift of the merger rate of massive galaxies is in qualitative agreement with predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 , baugh et al .",
    "1996 ) , although it is a challenge to explain both the recent assembly of massive early - types and the early formation of their stars .",
    "the presence of the mergers in 054 is direct evidence against formation of massive ellipticals in a `` monolithic '' collapse at very high redshift .    assuming merging does not alter the shape of the mass function , the mergers cause an increase in @xmath54 of @xmath55%",
    "this can be contrasted to the strong evolution in the number density of massive field galaxies inferred by kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) from the lack of luminous @xmath56-band selected galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "although this result is still uncertain , this may imply that massive galaxies in the field were assembled more recently than those in clusters .",
    "this study demonstrates that large field studies with hst , in combination with deep spectroscopy from the ground , can show directly how galaxy formation proceeded .",
    "the large field was essential , since the mergers are preferentially located in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "similar observations of high redshift clusters and the field would be valuable to test whether the results for 054 are typical .",
