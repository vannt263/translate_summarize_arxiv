    "electrical and heat conductivities are fundamental properties characterizing a crystal and their evaluation allows to determine whether a given material is suitable or not for a specific application . for instance",
    ", a piezoelectric material should be an electrical insulator to avoid current leakages when an electric field is applied  @xcite , while other applications as electronic or thermoelectric devices may require a conductor .",
    "recently , nanostructured materials have also attracted attention in the literature .",
    "the reduced size of such systems can change significantly their heat transport properties or improve their performance in specific applications .",
    "this happens for example in sintered powder nanocomposites , which can display a thermoelectric efficiency better than their bulk counterparts  @xcite .",
    "advances in simulation techniques and the increase of computational power allow nowadays to calculate and predict such properties in inexpensive ways and compare with experiments .",
    "moreover , to study and design new materials , it becomes ever more important to be able to predict material properties even before the material is experimentally synthesized , providing in this way guidance and search criteria ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for this aim , it is convenient to use theoretical techniques which are general enough to take into account broad classes of materials , as it is the case for plane - wave methods based on density - functional theory that we will use in this paper  @xcite .    among the transport properties of crystals ,",
    "thermal and electrical transport is currently being intensively studied in the literature , due to the interest in finding more efficient thermoelectric materials to be used for energy harvesting and waste heat recovery  @xcite . to assess the performance of a thermoelectric material",
    ", one can use the figure of merit @xmath2 , defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath5 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath6 is the thermal conductivity ( electronic+ionic ) and @xmath7 is the temperature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since a large @xmath2 coefficient indicates that the material could be a good thermoelectric , one should therefore try to maximize the seebeck coefficient @xmath5 and the electrical conductivity @xmath4 and at the same time reduce the thermal conductivity @xmath6 .",
    "these properties , however , are coupled and a balance between them is required in order to achieve a high figure of merit .",
    "currently , the best - performing commercially available bulk thermoelectric materials have a @xmath2 slightly above 1 at room temperature or above  @xcite , while the highest zt for a laboratory material engineered at the nano- and microscopic scale is 2.2  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "while for the calculation of the density of states ( dos ) one needs only the band energy dispersion @xmath8 over the brillouin zone , for the evaluation of electrical and thermal transport properties also band velocities are required ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : semiclassical - transport ] ) : @xmath9    a typical approach for the calculation of @xmath10 is to evaluate the band structure on a dense @xmath11 grid in the brillouin zone in reciprocal space , and to use a finite - difference method to evaluate its derivatives . to achieve convergence on transport properties , however",
    ", a very dense @xmath11 grid is required due to the steepness of the fermi ",
    "dirac distribution near the fermi energy .",
    "since with first - principles methods the solution of the eigenvalue problem is costly ( in general it scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the system size , and is directly proportional to the number of @xmath11 points in the brillouin zone ) , some form of interpolation of the bands is extremely beneficial  @xcite in order to complete the calculation within reasonable computation times , even more so if more accurate and costly electronic - structure approaches ( such as many - body perturbation theory ) are used  @xcite .",
    "this finite - difference procedure for the calculation of the band velocities , however , may be a source of error if the interpolation provides an incorrect band ordering near crossings .",
    "furthermore , only bands in an energy region of width @xmath14 around the chemical potential @xmath15 are relevant ; thus , in semiconductor systems we only need a detailed description of the bands near the band gap .",
    "it is then highly desirable to use models in which only this relevant energy window is considered .",
    "for all the above reasons , we present in this work our boltzwann code to evaluate electron transport properties in a semiclassical formalism using a maximally - localized wannier function ( mlwf ) basis  @xcite to interpolate first - principles plane - wave ( pw ) results . with this approach , we can accurately evaluate transport quantities by solving the eigenvalue problem on a coarse @xmath11-point reciprocal - space grid .",
    "once mlwfs have been obtained from this coarse @xmath11 grid , they can be used as a tight - binding basis to interpolate the band structure on a denser @xmath11 grid at a significantly smaller computational cost  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the strong exponential localization of the wfs ( see @xcite and secs . ii.g and vi.a of  @xcite ) , the results can match with excellent accuracy the full plane - wave calculations  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the wannier representation , the band derivatives can be evaluated analytically at an arbitrary @xmath11 point without the need to rely on finite - difference methods ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : velocity - interp ] ) , producing numerically stable results even at band crossings and near weak avoided crossings  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassical - transport ] we summarize the most relevant results of the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory that are used in the boltzwann code . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : wf - basis ] , we briefly introduce some fundamentals in the definitions and use of wannier functions , and in particular on how they can be used to interpolate band velocities at a generic @xmath11 point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : code - details ] the boltzwann code is presented and the relevant input parameters are described .",
    "finally , as a verification , in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] we use boltzwann to evaluate the thermal properties of two skutterudite systems ( cosb@xmath0 and coge@xmath1s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the results are compared with those obtained with the boltztrap code  @xcite , which uses a different scheme to interpolate the bands . a comparison with the experimental seebeck coefficient of cosb@xmath0  @xcite is also provided .",
    "the basic transport equations for the current density @xmath16 and the electronic heat current @xmath17 for a system in the presence of an electric field @xmath18 and a temperature gradient @xmath19 are given by  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are rank - two tensors which reduce to scalars for isotropic media ; @xmath21 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath22 is the seebeck coefficient , and the thermal conductivity @xmath24 is defined as ( minus ) the heat current per unit of temperature gradient in open - circuit conditions ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) and thus it is given by @xmath26 we stress that the heat current @xmath27 discussed here contains only the electronic contribution to the thermal transport ; to take into account also the ionic contribution , phonon  phonon scattering processes must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "note also that , especially in semiconductors and insulators , the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is the dominating one .",
    "we derive the expressions for the tensors @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the framework of the semiclassical transport theory using the boltzmann transport equation . a convenient general way of describing the collisional term in the boltzmann equation is to define a lifetime @xmath31 for an electron on band @xmath32 at wavevector @xmath11 .",
    "then , we obtain the following expressions for the transport tensors as a function of the chemical potential @xmath15 ( that depends on the doping of the system in a semiconductor ) and of the temperature @xmath7  @xcite : @xmath33_{ij}(\\mu , t)&=    e^{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}de\\left(-\\frac{\\partial        f(e,\\mu , t)}{\\partial e}\\right)\\sigma_{ij}(e),\\\\ \\label{eq : eq - seebeck }   [ \\bm{\\sigma}\\bm{s}]{}_{ij}(\\mu , t)&=    \\frac{e}{t}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}de\\left(-\\frac{\\partial        f(e,\\mu , t)}{\\partial e}\\right)(e-\\mu)\\sigma_{ij}(e),\\\\ \\label{eq : eq - thermal }   [ \\bm{k}]{}_{ij}(\\mu , t)&=    \\frac{1}{t}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}de\\left(-\\frac{\\partial        f(e,\\mu , t)}{\\partial e}\\right)(e-\\mu)^{2}\\sigma_{ij}(e).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are cartesian indices , @xmath36 denotes the matrix product of the two tensors , and @xmath37 is the derivative of the fermi  dirac distribution function with respect to the energy .",
    "moreover , we have defined the above quantities in terms of the transport distribution function ( tdf ) @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 where the summation is over all bands @xmath32 and over all the brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath8 is the energy for band @xmath32 at @xmath11 and @xmath40 is the @xmath41th component of the band velocity at @xmath42 given in eq .  .",
    "the most simple approximation that we adopt for the results shown in sec .  [ sec : application ] is to assume that the lifetime @xmath31 is independent both of @xmath32 and @xmath11 , and to choose the value @xmath43 by fitting the experimental values for , e.g. , the experimental electrical conductivity at a given temperature .",
    "this constant relaxation - time approximation is often adopted in first - principles calculations  @xcite , and despite its simplicity it often turns out to be a good approximation for bulk materials , even in the case of anisotropic systems  @xcite .",
    "this approximation can be relaxed if one is provided with a model for @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , one can take into account an energy dependence for the relaxation time  @xcite or calculate @xmath45 from first - principles considering explicitly the electron - phonon scattering mechanisms  @xcite . for sintered powders , instead ,",
    "a different model is more physically motivated , i.e. , the assumption of a constant mean free path , which is taken to be of the order of the grain size  @xcite . in any case , the boltzwann code presented here can be simply adapted to take into account any advanced model for lifetimes by using a @xmath46 and @xmath47dependent @xmath45 in eq .  .",

    ", two energy windows are defined .",
    "first , an outer energy window ( with @xmath56 ) is considered , and all original bloch states within this window are considered to construct wfs ( note that the number @xmath57 of bloch states in this window may vary from one @xmath11 point to another ) . then , an inner `` frozen '' window may be additionally defined ( with @xmath58 ) , where all bloch states are forced to be preserved . at this point",
    ", one has to map for each @xmath59 ( via a set of @xmath60 rectangular matrices ) the @xmath61 states onto an equal or smaller number of @xmath13 orthonormal bloch - like states , from which the wannier functions can be extracted by minimizing @xmath54 as described above .",
    "this mapping is obtained by enforcing a requirement of optimal smoothness across the brillouin zone of the `` disentangled '' subspace ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this way",
    ", one obtains at each @xmath11 point a new set of bloch functions , @xmath62 , that are those used to construct mlwfs by means of the transform in eq .",
    "( the superscript @xmath63 indicates that these are the bloch states used to construct mlwfs , and define the `` wannier '' gauge ) .",

    ", we compare our results for both systems with those obtained with the boltztrap code  @xcite .",
    "boltztrap is based on a smoothed fourier interpolation of the bands  @xcite , and finite differences are used to evaluate band derivatives .",
    "while this may lead to incorrect results for the derivatives at band crossings , it has been shown on selected systems to be negligible if the @xmath11 sampling is dense enough  @xcite . in the boltztrap calculations",
    ", we start a @xmath143 @xmath11 mesh from a non - self - consistent calculation performed with quantum espresso .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosb3-elcond ] we plot the electrical conductivity for cosb@xmath0 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath15 for the three temperatures @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146  k , and compare these results with those obtained by boltztrap code , showing excellent agreement .",
    "analogous plots for the seebeck coefficient @xmath5 and the @xmath147 coefficient of eqs .   and",
    "are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosb3-seebeck ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : coges - thermcond ] for electrical conductivity , seebeck coefficient and @xmath147 coefficient , respectively .",
    "also in this case the agreement between the two codes is very good , providing a validation of boltzwann .",
    "we also emphasize here that , since the first - principles band structure is reproduced correctly by the wannier interpolation only within the frozen window , discrepancies between the results of the two codes are to be expected when @xmath15 is outside the frozen window .    - and @xmath133-doped cosb@xmath0 .",

    "theoretical results are obtained assuming the experimental doping value and excluding effects due to intrinsic carriers .",
    "[ fig : exp - comparison - cosb3],width=377 ]    it is also instructive to compare our results with some experimental measurements , despite the known limitations of boltzmann transport theory  @xcite , and of lda in describing correctly the band gap of semiconductors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - comparison - cosb3 ] we compare in particular the experimental results for two ( te or pd ) @xmath32-doped cosb@xmath0 samples and one as - grown @xmath133-doped sample from caillat _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in order to reproduce the experimental results for the seebeck coefficient as a function of the temperature",
    ", we have to find consistently the chemical potential @xmath150 that reproduces the experimental doping level .",
    "to this aim , we use the boltzwann code to calculate the seebeck coefficient @xmath151 on a grid of @xmath152 and @xmath153 values , and we also calculate at the same time the density of states ( dos ) . for each given temperature @xmath7 , we then integrate the dos times the fermi distribution function and we find the value of the chemical potential @xmath150 that reproduces the experimental doping by means of a bisection algorithm . in this calculation , we neglect the effects of minority carriers . finally , we interpolate the @xmath151 grid obtained with boltzwann to obtain the value @xmath154 that is plotted in fig .

    "fig : exp - comparison - cosb3 ] .",
    "we observe a very good agreement at low temperatures , as also demonstrated before by wee _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for one of the experimental samples . at higher temperatures , deviations from the experiment",
    "are expected and can be at least partially attributed to the minor carriers starting to play a significant role  @xcite . moreover , while in the constant relaxation - time approximation the seebeck coefficient @xmath5 does not depend on @xmath44 , actual variations of @xmath44 over the brillouin zone may also be a cause of discrepancy .",
    "we have implemented and tested a new fortran module to obtain transport properties ( electrical conductivity , seebeck coefficient , electronic thermal conductivity ) in a semiclassical transport framework and using a maximally - localized wannier function basis to interpolate band structures and band velocities .",
    "we have verified the results of our code on the two skutterudite systems cosb@xmath0 and coge@xmath1s@xmath1 comparing the results with the publicly available boltztrap code , and have found a very good agreement of the results obtained with the two codes . a major advantage of this approach is the increased accuracy of the results due to the proper treatment of band crossings , thanks to the possibility of obtaining analytical expressions for the band derivatives in the wannier functions basis , and a much reduced computational cost .",
    "these advantages become even more relevant or essential in the case of very large systems , where many intersecting folded bands in the brillouin zone can be found . moreover , provided a model for the dependence of @xmath44 on the band index @xmath32 and on the quasimomentum @xmath11",
    ", the code can also be easily extended beyond the constant relaxation - time approximation .",
    "the code has been included as a boltzwann module inside the existing wannier90 code .",
    "it can therefore be used in combination with any code that provides an interface to wannier90 such as quantum espresso , abinit , siesta , fleur , wien2k , vasp , castep , ",
