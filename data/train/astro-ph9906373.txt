    "an outstanding unknown in @xmath0-ray  astronomy is the nature of a population of high - energy @xmath0-ray  sources at low galactic latitude which were first identified using the cos - b satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , these sources were studied in greater detail by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the high - energy @xmath0-ray  sources at high latitudes , which are typically associated with active galaxies , several dozen apparent point sources of high - energy @xmath0-rays at latitudes @xmath11 have as yet not been identified with astronomical objects . however , a handful of low - latitude sources has been identified with young , energetic radio pulsars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this suggests that many of the unidentified sources are also young pulsars .",
    "this hypothesis has been considered in various studies , many of which suggest that the majority , if not all , of the unidentified sources are pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "sturner & dermer ( 1995 ) suggested that many of the sources are not pulsars but rather are a result of cosmic ray interactions with gas in supernova remnants . with the egret  spatial resolution generally limited to tens of arcminutes , identification of discrete high - energy @xmath0-ray sources",
    "is difficult using spatial coincidence alone , explaining why this problem has remained open so long .",
    "rotation - powered pulsars permit a straightforward determination of the nature of a @xmath0-ray  source using the signature pulsed emission . indeed the crab and vela pulsars are long - known to be strong sources of pulsed @xmath0-rays .",
    "egret  has provided unambiguous and/or strong evidence for pulsations from five other rotation - powered pulsars ( see table  [ ta : psrs ] ) .",
    "five of the six pulsars having the highest values of the parameter @xmath12 , where the spin - down luminosity @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the pulse period and @xmath15 its rate of increase ) and @xmath16 is the distance to the source , are established sources of high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsations . finding rotation - powered pulsars at @xmath0-ray  energies is important because those detected thus far have their maximum luminosities in this energy range .",
    "thus @xmath0-rays  may hold the key to the poorly understood pulsar energy budget and emission mechanism , in which mechanical energy of rotation is efficiently converted into non - thermal high - energy radiation .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-rays   whether at the neutron star polar cap ( e.g. @xcite ) or in the outer magnetosphere ( e.g. @xcite )  is still debated . in this paper",
    "we examine high - energy @xmath0-ray  data from the direction of two young , energetic pulsars which are good candidates for observable @xmath0-ray  pulsations .",
    "psr  b1046@xmath158  is a 124  ms radio pulsar having characteristic age 20  kyr and spin - down luminosity @xmath17  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "it was discovered in a survey of the galactic plane for radio pulsars ( @xcite ) , and has an unremarkable radio average pulse profile , characterized by a single narrow peak having width @xmath188  ms at 1.4  ghz ( figure  [ fig:1046prof ] ) .",
    "its pulsed radio emission is highly linearly polarized and shows a slow position angle variation across the pulse , suggestive of conal emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dispersion measure of 129.01@xmath90.01  pc  @xmath19 toward this pulsar implies a distance of 2.98@xmath90.35  kpc ( @xcite ) . in the rank - ordered @xmath12 list ,",
    "psr  b1046@xmath158  falls ninth , with six of the eight above it known @xmath0-ray  pulsars , five of those six being high - energy @xmath0-ray sources ( see table  [ ta : psrs ] ) .",
    "the pulsar s position lies near the 95% confidence contour for the second egret catalog source 2eg j1049@xmath15847  ( @xcite ) .",
    "thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported a pulsed flux 99.9% confidence upper limit for energies above 100  mev of @xmath20  photons  @xmath7  s@xmath8 for a 50% duty cycle pulse .",
    "they noted , however , a `` hint '' of a pulsation for psr  b1046@xmath158  above 1  gev , having probability of chance occurrence of 14% .",
    "as reported in a companion paper , pivovaroff , kaspi & gotthelf ( 1999 ) have detected x - rays from the direction of the pulsar ; that emission is not pulsed and is probably due to a synchrotron nebula .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath16107  is a 63  ms pulsar having characteristic age 63  kyr and @xmath21  erg  s@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it exhibits a narrow double peaked radio pulse profile having width 3.4  ms at 1.6  ghz .",
    "its radio emission is highly linearly polarized , showing a slow positional angle variation suggestive of conal emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar s dispersion measure of 270.55@xmath90.14  pc  @xmath19 implies a distance of 7.1@xmath90.9  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "ranking by @xmath12 , it is 23rd , well above the known @xmath0-ray  pulsar psr  b1055@xmath152 ( whose distance may well be overestimated ; see @xcite and references therein ) though well below several sources which have not been detected by egret ( @xcite ) .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath16107  is spatially coincident with the unidentified egret source 2eg j1103@xmath16106  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath0-raysource has pulsar - like properties : it has a hard spectrum and is not time variable .",
    "however the second egret catalog noted marginal evidence for the source being extended .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath16107  has been detected as an unpulsed x - ray source ( @xcite ) ; this emission is best explained as being due to nebular synchrotron emission powered by the pulsar wind .",
    "given the importance of identifying @xmath0-ray  pulsations in radio pulsars as well as establishing the nature of the unidentified egret sources , additional egret exposure of the eta carina region was obtained .",
    "we report here on an analysis of egret data for psr  b1046@xmath158  obtained between 1991 may and 1997 october , and for psr  j1105@xmath16107  between 1993 july and 1997 october . in  [ sec : obs ] we summarize the egret observations used in our analysis . in  [ sec : results ] we report our findings , showing evidence for @xmath0-ray  pulsations from psr  b1046@xmath158 , but none from psr  j1105@xmath16107 .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ is sensitive to photons in the energy range from approximately 30  mev to 30  gev , using a multi - level spark chamber system to detect electron - positron pairs resulting from @xmath0-rays .",
    "a nai calorimeter provides energy resolution of 20 - 25% , and a plastic scintillator anti - coincidence dome prevents triggering on events not associated with high - energy photons .",
    "the detector thus has negligible background .",
    "the detector is described in more detail in thompson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and references therein .",
    "the data sets used in this analysis consist of archival data , as well as pi data for cycles 5 and 6 .",
    "data sets included event utc arrival times accurate to 100  @xmath22s , energy , measured direction of origin , satellite location , and other information .",
    "a summary of the observations of psrs  b1046@xmath158  and j1105@xmath16107  is presented in tables  [ ta:1046obs ] and [ ta:1105obs ] .",
    "the timing analysis was done using the interactive software pulsar which has been described elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) and is based on the tempo software package ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "event arrival times are first reduced to the solar system barycenter and then folded using a contemporaneous ephemeris derived from radio monitoring .",
    "young pulsars are notorious for displaying timing irregularities , namely glitches and long - term timing `` noise '' ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the pulsars in question are no exception ( @xcite )",
    ". timing noise alone can result in phase deviations as large as a full cycle over a year or two , while glitches can result in so large a phase deviation that only unusually dense observations can permit unambiguous phase determination .",
    "such deviations can not be tolerated when searching for @xmath0-ray  pulsations over many years , particularly when expecting weak pulsations , as even small deviations could broaden the signal beyond detectability .",
    "for this reason , we have used contemporaneous radio ephemerides determined by timing observations made at the 64-m radio telescope at parkes , australia .",
    "most radio observations were done at a central frequency near 1500  mhz , with some at 430 and 660 mhz . prior to 1995 , all data were obtained using filter - bank timing systems ( 2 @xmath23 64 @xmath23 5  mhz at 1520  mhz and 2 @xmath23 256 @xmath23 0.125  mhz at 430 and 660  mhz ) that have been described elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) . most data from after 1995 were obtained using the caltech correlator - based pulsar timing machine ( @xcite ) , which has @xmath24 lags across 128  mhz in each of two separate frequency bands . typically , correlator observations were made at central frequencies of 1420 and 1650  mhz simultaneously .",
    "filter - bank data were recorded on tape and folded off - line ; correlator data were folded on - line .",
    "resulting folded profiles were convolved with high signal - to - noise templates to yield topocentric pulse arrival times .",
    "resulting arrival times were analyzed using the standard tempo pulsar timing software package together with the jpl  de200 ephemeris ( @xcite ) .",
    "ephemerides for folding the @xmath0-ray  data were determined piecewise using a minimum of some two dozen arrival times per valid interval , with rms residuals well under the @xmath0-raybinning resolution in all cases .",
    "the ephemerides used are provided for each egret viewing period in publicly accessible machine - readable format at http://www.atnf.csiro.au / research / pulsar / psr / archive/.    since the range of radio frequencies observed at each epoch was not generally sufficiently large to determine dispersion measures with high precision , we assume that the dispersion measures do not vary significantly .",
    "substantial variations would result in changes in the pulse phase extrapolated from the radio ephemeris to the effectively infinite @xmath0-ray  frequency according to the cold plasma dispersion law .",
    "this could cause smearing of the pulse profile .",
    "we can test the plausibility of our assumption of a constant dispersion measure ( dm ) using the results of backer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who empirically characterized variations in dm for several pulsars .",
    "as neither pulsar considered here lies within a detectable supernova remnant ( @xcite ) , the very large dm variations observed for the crab and vela pulsars , usually attributed to their unusual environments , are unlikely to be present . from the empirical findings of backer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , for psr  b1046@xmath158 , the maximum dm variation per year expected is @xmath180.01  pc  @xmath19 . over the @xmath188",
    "yr duration of the experiment described here , this amounts to a variation in pulse phase of @xmath181.2@xmath25 , a factor of @xmath1840 smaller than our binning resolution . for psr",
    "j1105@xmath16107 , the dm variation could be an order of magnitude larger , however the experiment in this case spans only @xmath184  yr . the phase variation then could be as large as @xmath181.1@xmath26 , smaller , but only by a factor of @xmath184 , than our binning resolution .",
    "we conclude that dm variations are certainly negligible for psr  b1046@xmath158 , and probably negligible for psr  j1105@xmath16107 .",
    "the energy dependence of the point - spread function of the egret detector can be characterized by the function @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the half - angle of the cone encircling the actual source direction and which contains 67% of the events having energy @xmath29 in mev ( @xcite ) . in our timing analysis",
    ", we used all events within @xmath28 .",
    "the source directions are ( j2000 ) ra 10@xmath30  48@xmath31  12@xmath32.6(3 ) , dec @xmath158@xmath33  32@xmath34  03@xmath35.75(1 ) for psr  b1046@xmath158  ( @xcite ) , and ( j2000 ) ra 11@xmath30  05@xmath31  26@xmath32.07(7 ) , dec @xmath161@xmath33  07@xmath34  52@xmath36 for psr  j1105@xmath16107  ( @xcite ) , where the numbers in brackets are @xmath37 uncertainties .",
    "the total number of counts folded is given for each viewing period in tables  [ ta:1046obs ] and [ ta:1105obs ] for psrs  b1046@xmath158  and j1105@xmath16107 , respectively .",
    "spatial analysis of @xmath0-ray  data is done using the likelihood ratio test ( @xcite ) .",
    "the significance of a point source is found using a test statistic @xmath38 that compares the likelihood of the distribution of counts ( which is governed by poisson statistics ) having occurred under the null hypothesis of no point source , with that with a point source present , given the instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "mattox et al . have shown that a point - source significance in units of the standard deviation is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the likelihood under the assumption of a point source and @xmath42 is that under the null hypothesis .",
    "the likelihood itself is given by @xmath43 where the product is over pixel @xmath44 that contains @xmath45 counts , and the model prediction is @xmath46 .",
    "in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] , we present the folded light curve for psr  b1046@xmath158  for energies above 400  mev .",
    "the significance of the apparent modulation can only be established using appropriate statistical tests .",
    "the optimal test is the h - test ( @xcite ) , which provides a figure of merit for a folded light curve that is independent of the number of bins or of the phase of the putative signal .",
    "for this reason , the h - test is superior to the standard @xmath47 test ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further , the h statistic has been shown to be optimal when considering a light curve having unknown pulse morphology . in this sense , it is superior to the @xmath48 test ( @xcite ) which can be done for specified numbers of harmonics only . for the light curve in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] ,",
    "the h statistic is 22.5 , which has a probability of @xmath2 of having occurred by random chance , with 5 harmonics indicated .",
    "this corresponds to an equivalent normal distribution deviation of @xmath49 from the null hypothesis of no pulsations . for reference , @xmath50 for 10 bins ( 9 degrees of freedom ) ;",
    "the probability of this value or higher having occurred by chance is @xmath51 ( 3.1@xmath52 ) .",
    "the @xmath53 statistic has value 33.8 ; the probability of this value or higher having occurred by chance is @xmath54 ( 4.1@xmath52 ) .",
    "note that there is effectively only a single trial folding period .",
    "since we considered two pulsars , these probabilities should be multiplied by a factor of two .",
    "although we did not search independent energy bands , the choice of 400  mev lower energy cutoff was made to optimize the significance ; we discuss this further below .",
    "we have checked the robustness of our result in several ways .",
    "first , we divided the total data set into two halves of approximately equal size and verified that the signal is seen in both , albeit at reduced significance , as expected .",
    "for the first half data set ( mjds 4838649361 ) , we find h=16.7 , which has probability @xmath55 , while for the second half data set ( mjds 4936150728 ) we found h=15.0 , having probability @xmath56 .",
    "these statistics are for @xmath57  mev .",
    "second , we verified that the signal persisted when the energy - dependent cone opening angle ( eq .  [ eq : theta ] ) was increased to include 99% of the counts from the known source direction ; in this case we found h=12.5 , which has probability @xmath58 .",
    "note that zero is suppressed in the light curve shown in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] .",
    "the observed pulsed fraction for @xmath57  mev is @xmath59 .",
    "the off - pulse @xmath0-rays  may originate as diffuse galactic emission  the pulsar is located in the complicated eta carina region , tangent to the carina spiral arm , which is known to contain significant diffuse emission and many discrete sources .",
    "( @xcite ) . in  [ sec:1046spatialres ]",
    "we describe a spatial analysis that indicates that a small fraction of the off - pulse could be emission from psr  b1046@xmath158 itself .",
    "one way to check for the presence of contaminating diffuse emission is to utilize the different expected spectra of diffuse and pulsed signals . in figure  [ fig:1046stats ]",
    "we show , in the lower panel , results of three statistical tests as a function of lower cutoff energy .",
    "the probability shown is that of finding the value of the statistical test , or higher , for a profile consisting of folded photons having energies above the cutoff . the upper panel shows the number of photons included in the analysis , here done for counts within @xmath28 .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior is as expected : the diffuse emission has a softer spectrum than those of the known @xmath0-ray  pulsars , so as the lower energy bound is increased , the significance of the pulse should increase until the pulsar signal is too photon - starved to be detected .",
    "furthermore , the egret psf narrows with increasing energy ( eq .",
    "[ eq : theta ] ) , so diffuse emission and nearby confusing point sources are preferentially removed as the lower energy bound is increased given advance knowledge of the pulsar position ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the sudden decrease in significance when the lower energy cut changes from 400 to 600  mev is unexpected , given the smooth decrease in the number of counts .",
    "this could indicate a spectral cutoff in the pulsed emission , or could simply be a result of the poor statistics for the pulse profile ; it could also suggest the apparently significant modulation is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the detection of pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray  emission from psr  b1951 + 32 by ramanamurthy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) was done by considering events selected from a cone of fixed angle with respect to the pulsar position , as a compromise between maximizing signal from the source and minimizing background contamination .",
    "we have carried out the same analysis for psr  b1046@xmath158 , using a fixed cone of @xmath60 half - angle .",
    "we chose this size cone as it resulted in a comparable total number of events as for the energy - dependent cone .",
    "for the fixed cone , we find h@xmath61 , corresponding to a probability of @xmath62 ( 4.0@xmath52 ) , an improvement over the energy - dependent - cone results .",
    "this supports the reality of the pulsations .",
    "however , not all the profile statistics improve for the fixed cone ; for example , the @xmath47 statistic drops to 25.3 , corresponding to a probability of @xmath63 ( 3.0@xmath52 ) , still statistically significant , but less so than with the energy - dependent cone .",
    "ramanamurthy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported high - energy @xmath0-raypulsations from the radio pulsar psr  b0656 + 14 using photons that had been `` weighted '' according to their energy and direction , and the known telescope response .",
    "we have employed a similar algorithm to theirs in considering the apparent modulation seen in the unweighted data .",
    "each event is assigned a weight which is equal to the probability that a specific @xmath0-ray  originated from the point source ( rather than as diffuse galactic emission ) , @xmath64 where psf@xmath65 is the energy - dependent egret point spread function , the probability per steradian for a photon of energy @xmath29 to be detected at a measured angle @xmath66 from the source .",
    "@xmath67 is the ratio of diffuse galactic counts per steradian to source counts at energy @xmath29 .",
    "as the combinations of weights within phase bins are , unlike the unweighted data , not described by poisson statistics , the same statistical tests do not apply .",
    "instead , we considered the simple statistical standard deviation of the binned values , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "we used monte carlo simulations of profiles to determine the probability of chance occurrence of a profile having this statistic .",
    "simulated profiles of weighted data were made by randomly varying the phases . in this way , for @xmath70  mev , we found that the probability of obtaining a profile having the same modified @xmath47 statistic or higher for the folded , weighted data was 0.026 .",
    "thus the significance of the detection decreases using the weights .",
    "this was not expected .",
    "however , given the evidence below in favor of the association , it does not eliminate the possibility that pulsed flux is being detected from psr  b1046@xmath158 ; the decrease in significance could be due to the poorly known pulsed @xmath0-ray  spectrum ( which was assumed to be a power law of index 1.97@xmath90.07  see  [ sec : spectrum ] ) or to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "we have conducted a likelihood analysis ( @xcite ) of the egret data for psr  b1046@xmath158  ( see  [ sec : spatial ] ) for @xmath57  mev events . in the analysis , the model for the diffuse galactic flux of hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was used , and the flux of nearby sources in the second egret catalog ( @xcite ) was estimated simultaneously with that from the position of psr  b1046@xmath158 .",
    "a point source at the pulsar position was detected with a significance of @xmath71 .",

    "the distribution of egret events is consistent with the egret psf ; we find a reduced @xmath47 of 1.3 for the sum of all events for cycles 16 of the egret mission .",
    "a similar analysis was done for different rotational phases .",
    "phase - resolved event maps for @xmath57  mev were made for peak 1 ( phases 0.3000.475 ) , interpeak 1 ( 0.4750.675 ) , peak 2 ( 0.6750.825 ) , and interpeak 2 ( 0.8250.300 ) .",
    "the peak 1 and peak 2 maps were combined to form an `` on - pulse '' map .",
    "the interpeak 1 and interpeak 2 maps were combined to form an `` off - pulse '' map .",
    "for the on - pulse map , a point source at the position of psr  b1046@xmath158  was detected with a significance of @xmath74 , corresponding to an estimated 203@xmath925 @xmath0-ray events .",
    "for the off - pulse map , a point source at the position of psr  b1046@xmath158  was detected with a significance of @xmath75 corresponding to an estimated 144@xmath929 @xmath0-ray events .",
    "the distribution of egret events was consistent with the psf for both the on- and off - pulse phase selections .",
    "the egret position estimate was also consistent with that of psr  b1046@xmath158  for both the on- and off - pulse phase selections .",
    "thus , significant flux is detected during both the on- and off - pulse phases , and it appears that both the pulsar and diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission contribute to the emission represented by the suppressed zero in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] .",
    "we also subdivided the on - pulse map into two , by making separate maps for peak 1 and peak 2 data .",
    "both peak 1 and peak 2 show a point source at the position of the pulsar , with significances of 6.0@xmath52 and 8.4@xmath52 , respectively .",
    "maps of `` residual '' flux were also made for both the on- and off - pulse phase selections by subtracting the counts distribution for nearby sources , counts corresponding to an isotropic flux of @xmath76  photons  @xmath7  s@xmath8  sr@xmath8 , and counts corresponding to diffuse galactic flux ( with an empirically determined scaling factor of 0.242 for the model of hunter et al .",

    "( 1996 ) found that 2eg j1049@xmath15847  had a spectral index of 2.0@xmath90.1 , and noted that the @xmath0-ray  source had properties consistent with the known @xmath0-ray  pulsar population , as well as the positional coincidence with psr  b1046@xmath158 .",

    "using the results of the on - pulse spatial analysis (  [ sec:1046spatialres ] ) together with the reported 3eg point source flux ( @xcite ) and spectrum ( bertsch et al . 1999 ) , we derive a pulsed flux for @xmath57  mev of @xmath6  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath8 , which corresponds to an efficiency for conversion of spin - down luminosity into pulsed @xmath57  mev @xmath0-rays of 0.011@xmath90.03 for 1  sr beaming , assuming @xmath81  kpc . using the derived total pulsed fraction (  [ sec:1046time ] ) , the total number of counts and the exposure yields consistent results . the observed",
    "flux is consistent with previously published upper limits ( thompson et al . 1994 ) .",
    "mclaughlin et al . ( 1996 ) quantified the variability of egret sources and showed that known @xmath0-ray  pulsars are not variable , in contrast to all known @xmath0-ray - loud active galaxies for which accurate @xmath0-ray  flux measurements have been made .",
    "they further analyzed the variability of the unidentified egret sources and concluded that 2eg j1049@xmath15847  is non - variable , consistent with its identification as an energetic rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "an analysis of the larger data set used to produce the 3eg catalog reveals no evidence for variability from the source , consistent with its identification as a rotation - powered pulsar ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath0-ray  profile shown in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] lends some support to its interpretation as pulsations from psr  b1046@xmath158 .",
    "note that in the profile , the difference in height between the two peaks is not statistically significant , and the bin resolution is optimal .",
    "the two peaks , having separation 0.36@xmath90.13 in pulse phase , is reminiscent of the @xmath0-ray  profile of the vela pulsar ( e.g. @xcite ) , which has comparable spin - down parameters .",
    "similar @xmath0-ray  pulse profiles are also observed for the crab pulsar , geminga , and psr b1951 + 32 ( thompson 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "hard x - ray observations of the vela pulsar reveal a pulse profile that is similar to that at @xmath0-ray  energies ( @xcite ) ; this suggests that hard x - ray observations of psr  b1046@xmath158  could confirm its identification as a source of pulsed @xmath0-rays .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that the profile of other well - established high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsars is not as clearly double peaked .",
    "for example , psr  b1706@xmath144 , whose spin - down parameters most closely resemble those of psr  b1046@xmath158 , has a @xmath0-ray profile whose morphology could be interpreted , within the limited statistics , as either single or double peaked with small peak separation .",
    "therefore the double peaked profile in figure  1 does not lend unambiguous support to the proposed association .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  pulse s offset from the single radio pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1046prof ] ) is similar to those seen in the known high - energy @xmath0-ray  pulsars .",
    "the offset in time between the peak of the radio pulse and the approximate centroid of the first of the two @xmath0-ray  peaks shown in figure  [ fig:1046prof ] is 0.19@xmath90.12 in pulse phase , with the uncertainty dominated by the poor profile statistics .",
    "the phase offset to the approximate midpoint between the two apparent pulses is 0.37@xmath90.13 .",
    "the uncertainty in these numbers due to the uncertainty of 0.01  pc  @xmath19 in the single - epoch dm measurement (  [ sec : intro ] ) is negligible .",
    "this offset is similar to those of the other @xmath0-ray  pulsars having similar @xmath0-ray  pulse morphologies , namely the crab ( considering the radio precursor as the analog of the psr  b1046@xmath158  radio pulse ) , vela , and psr b1951 + 32 ( @xcite and references therein ) . these show an approximate empirical trend of radio@xmath0-ray  phase offset that increases with characteristic age ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed radio/@xmath0-ray  offset for psr  b1046@xmath158  is in agreement with this trend , which predicts an offset in the approximate range 0.320.38 .",
    "in addition to thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) noting a hint of a @xmath0-raypulsation from psr  b1046@xmath158 , fierro ( 1995 ) discussed a possible association between the pulsar and 2eg j1049@xmath15847  in detail .",
    "he noted the positional coincidence as well as the plausibility of the implied spectral and energy properties of the putative @xmath0-ray  pulsar .",
    "he also noted the absence of variability in the source .",
    "yadigaroglu & romani ( 1997 ) used a statistical test that quantifies the probability for positional coincidence of unidentified egret sources with nearby young objects .",
    "they identified the psr  b1046@xmath158  / 2eg j1049@xmath15847  association using this analysis .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1998 ) argued that the psr  b1046@xmath158  / 2eg j1049@xmath15847  association was plausible on the basis of predictions from a version of the outer gap model of @xmath0-ray  production in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "if the association between psr  b1046@xmath158  and 2eg j1049@xmath15847  is correct , then this is only the eighth pulsar to show evidence for high - energy @xmath0-raypulsations .",
    "the poor statistics in the folded profile and the presence of significant off - pulse emission preclude detailed analysis of the @xmath0-ray  emission properties .",
    "nevertheless , the pulsar s apparent @xmath0-ray  properties resemble those of other known @xmath0-ray  pulsars , particularly the crab and vela pulsars and psr b1951 + 32 ( radio and @xmath0-ray  pulse morphologies and phase offset ) .",
    "psr  b1046@xmath158  further shares a property common to all other known `` older '' @xmath0-ray  pulsars ( that is , excluding the crab and psr b1509@xmath158 ) , namely that its maximum luminosity appears to be in the high - energy @xmath0-ray  range .",
    "by contrast , pivovaroff et al . ( 1999 ) show that psr  b1046@xmath158 s efficiency for conversion of @xmath82 into x - rays in the asca range is only @xmath83 .",
    "we now consider what the implications of the possible @xmath0-raypulsations from psr  b1046@xmath158  are for models of @xmath0-ray  emission from rotation - powered pulsars . if the pulsations are real , the observed phase offset of the radio pulse is difficult to understand in the context of models in which the @xmath0-rays  are produced by particles which are accelerated along open field lines near the neutron star by electric fields ( e.g. @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the radio emission is thought to arise in the same polar cap region , so the radio pulse should be observed between the @xmath0-ray  peaks , which result from emission from a hollow cone .",
    "the conal geometry results from the smaller radius of curvature of magnetic field lines near the polar cap rim ( see harding 1996 for a review ) .",
    "this radio/@xmath0-rayphase problem has been noted for other @xmath0-ray  pulsars as well , e.g. vela ( @xcite ) ; the results reported here argue that the problem is general . also",
    ", emission beams in the polar cap model tend to be narrow and aligned with the magnetic and spin axes ( e.g. @xcite ) ; this can pose a problem for the pulsar birth rate . however , the radio phase offset problem , as argued by harding & muslimov ( 1998 ) , seems general to both the polar cap @xmath0-ray  emission model as well as to geometric models of thermal x - ray pulsations , while the relative phases of the latter two are consistent .",
    "polar cap models therefore make a testable prediction regarding the phase of the peak of any thermal x - ray emission that may one day be detected from psr  b1046@xmath158 .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray  pulse morphology and radio phase offset for psr  b1046@xmath158  are , by contrast , well explained in the outer gap model . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission is produced in the charge - depleted region between the closed magnetic field lines and the velocity of light cylinder ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the double peaked @xmath0-ray  pulse morphology in this model arises from a single pole s outer gap that has uniform emissivity along its field lines but in which the radiation is subject to significant relativistic aberration and time - of - flight delays through the magnetosphere ; the expected pulse morphology for most viewing geometries is double peaked , as long as the magnetic inclination is not small .",
    "the morphology and phase are also consistent with the geometry proposed by manchester ( 1996 ) in which the radio emission is produced in the outer gap as well .",
    "the outer gap model predicts bridge emission between the two @xmath0-ray  peaks , whose outer edges should be sharp ; this could be tested with an improved @xmath0-ray  pulse profile .",
    "this model results in large beaming fractions that are consistent with the pulsar birth rate ; this implies that most , if not all , of the unidentified egret low - latitude sources that have constant fluxes are young rotation - powered pulsars ( @xcite ) , although most of them will not be detectable in radio waves from earth because of smaller radio beaming fractions .",
    "we note , however , that recently reported very tentative evidence for @xmath0-ray  emission from the millisecond pulsar psr  j0218 + 4232 ( @xcite ) could pose a problem for the outer gap model , which predicts that millisecond pulsars should not be detectable in high - energy @xmath0-rays  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial analysis of the egret data presented in  [ sec:1046spatialres ] showed evidence for off - pulse emission consistent with coming from a point source coincident with the pulsar . for @xmath57  mev , this emission has flux @xmath84  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath8 , which corresponds to @xmath85% of @xmath82 , for isotropic emission .",
    "the poor spatial resolution of egret obviously precludes a firm association between the pulsar and this unpulsed emission , although we note that off - pulse @xmath0-ray  emission has been seen for the crab , vela and geminga pulsars , with that of the crab possibly originating in the surrounding nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "since we find no evidence for @xmath0-ray  pulsations for psr  j1105@xmath16107 , we set an upper limit on the fraction of @xmath82 that is converted into high - energy @xmath0-rays  beaming in our direction .",
    "the counterpart to 2eg j1103@xmath16106  in the 3eg catalog , 3eg j1102@xmath16103 , has flux @xmath86  photons  @xmath7  s@xmath8 for @xmath10  mev , and photon index @xmath87 ( @xcite ) . using these numbers , we infer with 99% confidence that psr  j1105@xmath16107  converts less than @xmath88  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath8 and @xmath89  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath8 for duty cycles of 0.5 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "these limits correspond to efficiencies for conversion of spin - down luminosity of less than 0.014 and 0.006 for 1  sr beaming and assuming a distance of 7  kpc , for duty cycles 0.5 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "these limits are not constraining on models of @xmath0-rayemission .",
    "we have found evidence for @xmath0-ray  emission from the young , energetic radio pulsar psr  b1046@xmath158 , which , if correct , establishes a counterpart for the previously unidentified high - energy @xmath0-ray  source 2eg j1049@xmath15847  ( gev j1046@xmath15840 , 3eg j1048@xmath15840 ) .",
    "the evidence can be summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) psr  b1046@xmath158  has the ninth highest value of @xmath12 of the known radio pulsars , with six of the eight higher slots occupied by known @xmath0-ray  pulsars .",
    "this suggests that psr  b1046@xmath158  is likely to be detectable in @xmath0-rays .",
    "( ii ) the radio pulsar is spatially coincident with the unidentified egret source 2eg j1049@xmath15847 .",
    "( iii ) the folded light curve for @xmath73  mev , obtained using contemporaneous radio ephemerides , is characterized by an h - test statistic 22.5 ; the chance probability of this value or higher having occurred is @xmath90 .",
    "this number should be multiplied by a factor of two for the two pulsars we searched .",
    "( iv ) a spatial likelihood analysis of on- and off - pulse data reveals a point source coincident with the radio pulsar position whose significance is much greater on - pulse than off ( 10.2@xmath52 versus 5.8@xmath52 ) .",
    "( v ) the only hard x - ray point source detected in the 95% egret error box is spatially coincident with the pulsar ( pivovaroff et al .",
    "( vi ) the @xmath0-ray  light curve morphology resembles those of other the known @xmath0-ray  pulsars ( the crab and vela pulsars , geminga , and psr  b1951 + 32 ) , namely , two narrow peaks separated by @xmath180.4 in pulse phase .",
    "( vii ) the inferred radio/@xmath0-ray  phase offset is consistent with trends seen for other pulsars .",
    "the implied efficiency for conversion of spin - down energy into @xmath57  mev @xmath0-rays , 0.011@xmath90.003 for @xmath81  kpc and 1  sr beaming , is consistent with those seen for other pulsars .",
    "we also found evidence for spatially unresolved unpulsed @xmath0-ray  emission from the pulsar position , as has been reported for the crab , vela and geminga pulsars .",
    "if the association between psr  b1046@xmath158  and 2eg j1049@xmath15847  emission exists , it should be confirmed by glast , the planned gamma - ray large area space telescope , which will provide significantly higher angular resolution and more detector area than egret .",
    "it may be possible to confirm the @xmath0-raypulsations by detecting magnetospheric x - ray pulsations from psr  b1046@xmath158  at hard x - ray energies .",
    "the similarity of this pulsar s rotational parameters and high - energy @xmath0-ray  efficiency to those of psr  b1706@xmath144 suggest tev emission might be detectable .",
    "thermal emission from the initial cooling of this young neutron star may also be detectable .    if the association between psr  b1046@xmath158  and 2eg j1049@xmath15847  holds , that seven of the top nine pulsars ranked by @xmath12 are @xmath0-ray  pulsars ( with one of the two remainders not having been studied at @xmath0-ray  energies  see table  1 ) implies at the very least that the radio and @xmath0-raybeams are aligned closely , or that @xmath0-ray  beams are wide .",
    "in fact , the morphology of the observed @xmath0-ray  pulse and the phase offset of the radio pulse provide support for the outer gap model of @xmath0-rayemission ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this model predicts that an improved @xmath0-ray  profile should find bridge emission between the pulses whose outer edges should be sharp . in this model ,",
    "most or all of the unidentified egret sources that have constant fluxes are young rotation - powered pulsars like psr  b1046@xmath158 , though most radio beams will not be detectable from earth due to small radio beaming fractions . our analysis of egret data from the direction of psr  j1105@xmath16107finds no evidence for @xmath0-ray  pulsations .",
    "this pulsar converts at most 0.014 ( 99% confidence ) of its spin - down power to @xmath10  mev @xmath0-rays  beamed in our direction , assuming 1  sr beaming , a duty cycle of 0.5 , and a distance to the source of 7  kpc .",
