    "integrability of string dynamics in ads spaces is one of the most actively discussed topic of the last decade due to its important role in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "string equations have the most simple and symmetric form in conformal coordinates .",
    "the conformal gauge freedom of string dynamics in @xmath7 can be fixed by turning the spherical part of the virasoro constraint to a positive constant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "then , the ads part of the constraint becomes @xmath9 and the string description splits in two schemes of pohlmeyer reduction @xcite .",
    "they lead to generalized sin - gordon and sinh - gordon equations for the sphere and ads space , respectively .",
    "these equations allow a lax pair representation , which is a basis for the integration of string dynamics .",
    "details of this approach and the related list of references one can find in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if strings propagate only in ads space ( the case @xmath10 ) , the described gauge fixing procedure fails .",
    "however , the pohlmeyer scheme can be modified in a conformally invariant form @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach was effectively used in @xmath6 , providing there a new set of interesting string solutions @xcite .",
    "the pohlmeyer scheme is usually formulated in terms of a linear system of differential equations for a basis along the string surface .",
    "this basis is formed by the tangent and orthogonal vectors to the surface and , therefore , the equations of the linear system contain components of the first and the second fundamental quadratic forms .",
    "the consistency conditions for the linear system provide dynamical equations and chirality relations for the worldsheet variables .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied general aspects of pohlmeyer reduction for ads strings in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "motivated by the alday - maldacena conjecture @xcite , we have extended the pohlmeyer scheme to the spacelike surfaces , where the chiral conditions are replaced by holomorphic ones . to simplify the discussion , we turned the worldsheet chiral ( or holomorphic ) functions to constants .",
    "locally this is always allowed due to the conformal freedom .",
    "however , information about some nontrivial string worldsheets might be encoded in global properties of chiral or holomorphic functions ( as in @xcite ) and , therefore , such solutions could be lost by a simple gauging .",
    "gauge fixing in string theory is a subtle problem even in flat spacetime .",
    "it appears that the standard light cone gauge string surfaces in 3d minkowski space are singular .",
    "namely , the induced metric tensor is degenerated at some points or lines of the surface , and the scalar curvature diverges there .    among the new solutions constructed in @xcite",
    "there are the spiky strings @xcite , which become important ingredients in ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "note that the spiky singularities also correspond to the degeneracy of the induced metric tensor .",
    "a natural question related to non regular string surfaces is to understand the character of singularities and their role in quantized string theory . in the present paper",
    "we study this problem for timelike closed strings in three dimensions .",
    "we start with the analysis of the flat case . using a gauge fixing for the components of the fundamental quadratic forms , we integrate the linear system of the pohlmeyer scheme and realize that the obtained surfaces are associated with the standard lightcone gauge strings .",
    "then we shown that the chiral @xmath11 and the antichiral @xmath12 components of the second quadratic form do not have fixed signs in the lightcone gauge .    to analyze the sector with fixed signs of @xmath11 and @xmath13 we use the gauge , which turns these functions to constants @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "the consistency condition in this gauge reduces to the liouville equation , and the periodicity of closed string worldsheets fixes the monodromy class of liouville fields by the matrixes @xmath16 .",
    "these are singular liouville fields , which are parameterized by the virasoro coadjoint orbits of the vacuum configurations @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are nonzero integers @xcite .",
    "the vacuum configurations of the liouville field describe oscillating circular and rotating spiky strings .",
    "the shape of a spiky string configuration at a fixed time essentially depends on the relative sign between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as well as on the values of @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "the virasoro coadjoint orbits define internal degrees of freedom of spiky strings , providing their ` conformal deformations ' .    in section 3 we consider strings in @xmath6 . here",
    "we ` improve ' the integrability of string dynamics by adding the wz - term to the action , which turns the system to the @xmath1 wzw theory with virasoro constraints @xcite .",
    "this model , called @xmath1 or @xmath24 string , was a subject of intensive study in the 90 s ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "we apply again the pohlmeyer type scheme . using the isometry between @xmath25 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the scheme is formulated in a form equivalent to 3d minkowski case , which allows to use some results of the previous classification here .",
    "namely , the kac - moody currents have the same parameterization as the worldsheet tangent vectors in @xmath0 .",
    "the next step is the integration of the kac - moody currents to string worldsheets embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the main difference with the flat case arises just at this point .",
    "another difference is related to the calculation of the worldsheet metric , which involves the string solution , and not only the chiral currents , as in @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and discuss open problems . some technical details are shifted to the appendixes .",
    "in this section we analyze string dynamics in 3d minkowski space @xmath0 within the scheme of pohlmeyer reduction @xcite .",
    "this approach sheds new light to known results of string theory in flat spacetime . the scalar product in @xmath0 we denote by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the coordinates of @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a closed string with periodic boundary conditions @xmath29 .",
    "the derivatives with respect to the lightcone coordinates @xmath30 @xmath31 are denoted by @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the pohlmeyer scheme for string dynamics is applied in the conformal gauge @xmath34 where @xmath35 satisfies the free field equation @xmath36    the conformal gauge conditions ( [ conformal gauge ] ) provide the relation @xmath37 the timelikeness of the string worldsheet implies @xmath38 and , therefore , the non zero component of the induced metric tensor can be parameterized by @xmath39 however , it has to be noted that the induced metric can be degenerated @xmath40 at some points or lines of the string worldsheet , where the tangent vector @xmath41 becomes lightlike .",
    "these singular points correspond to @xmath42 , though the functions @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) remain smooth ( differentiable ) there .    to follow the pohlmeyer scheme , we introduce a basis @xmath45 in @xmath46 formed by the vectors @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which is an unit vector orthogonal to the string surface @xmath50    then , from ( [ conformal gauge])-([b dot b ] ) one finds the following linear system of equations for the ` moving ' basis along the string world sheet @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the components of the second fundamental form on the worldsheet @xmath54    the consistency conditions for the linear system ( [ partial b ] ) are @xmath55    all these equations are invariant under the conformal transformations @xmath56 together with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 here are monotonic and they satisfy the monodromy conditions @xmath61 this symmetry is a remnant of the reparameterization invariance of string theory in the conformal coordinates .",
    "one can use this invariance to remove remaining non physical degrees of freedom and simplify the integration procedure .",
    "we follow this scheme in the next two subsections .",
    "the functions @xmath62 and @xmath12 are assumed smooth and periodic , like the components of the tangent vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we specify two different classes of @xmath65 @xmath66 . the first class is formed by the functions which change signs in the interval of periodicity , whereas @xmath62 and @xmath66 have no zeros for the second class .",
    "the gauge fixing conditions differ for these classes are different .",
    "after integration of the linear system ( [ partial b ] ) we realize that the first class corresponds to the standard lightcone gauge and the second class describes spiky and oscillating circular strings .",
    "the scheme proposed in this subsection is quite similar to the one used in @xcite and @xcite . before integration of the linear system ( [ partial b ] ) we have to find solutions of the consistency conditions ( [ gauss eq ] ) .",
    "these conditions are satisfied by the following simple parameterization @xmath67",

    "therefore , the periodicity of the functions @xmath71 @xmath53 and @xmath72 is a necessary , but not a sufficient condition for periodicity of @xmath70 .    the integration of the linear system ( [ partial b ] ) with @xmath73 @xmath53 and @xmath74 given by ( [ u = f ] ) is done in appendix a and it leads to @xmath75 @xmath76 here @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 are @xmath80-independent @xmath0-valued vectors , which arise as integration constants in solving ( [ partial b ] ) .",
    "the map from the vectors @xmath81 to @xmath82 is invertible and the orthonormality conditions for the basis @xmath82 is equivalent to @xmath83 these conditions are realized by @xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 is the standard orthonormal basis in @xmath0 , with @xmath87 the scalar and exterior products of these basis vectors @xmath88 are given by the metric @xmath89 and the levi - civita @xmath90 tensors , respectively . with @xmath91 , the algebra of exterior products yields @xmath92 and @xmath93 using then ( [ u = f ] ) , the normal vector ( [ n = f bar f ] ) can be written in a lorentz invariant form @xmath94 other realizations of ( [ e.e ] ) are obtained by lorentz transformations of ( [ e = e_a ] ) .",
    "the tangent vectors to a closed string worldsheet @xmath95 and @xmath96 are periodic chiral and antichiral vector functions respectively .",
    "hence , the functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 in ( [ b = f ] ) have to be periodic as well and they enjoy the fourier mode expansions @xmath99 in addition , the periodicity of @xmath70 requires equality of the zero modes of @xmath100 and @xmath101 these conditions are given by @xmath102 eqs .",
    "( [ fourier modes])-([p = bar p ] ) define the class of @xmath103 @xmath104 leading to periodic @xmath70 .",
    "these string surfaces , besides @xmath105 and @xmath106 depend on the parameters of lorentz transformations of the basis ( [ e = e_a ] ) and also on three integration constants related to the final equations @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    the general solution of the consistency conditions ( [ gauss eq ] ) , given by @xcite @xmath109 ^ 2}{2\\phi'(z)\\,\\bar\\phi\\,'(\\bar z)}\\ , \\,u(z)\\,\\bar u(\\bar z)~,\\ ] ] depends on two chiral ( @xmath110 ) and two antichiral ( @xmath111 ) functions .",
    "the parameterization ( [ u = f ] ) defines a ` constraint surface ' in the space of fundamental quadratic forms and it can be treated as a gauge fixing condition .",
    "in fact , a gauge fixing condition in ( [ g - solution ] ) can be written in the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant . then , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 we obtain ( [ u = f ] ) .    in order to find independent parameterizing variables of string surfaces",
    "@xmath116 it is important to analyze the remaining freedom of conformal transformations in ( [ u = f ] ) .",
    "this analysis is done in appendix b. it shows that the freedom of conformal transformations in ( [ u = f ] ) is described by three parameters @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the first two correspond to translations in the chiral and antichiral sectors .",

    "this means that the parameters related to the transformations ( [ e mapsto 1 ] ) and ( [ e mapsto 2 ] ) can be neglected , since the corresponding freedom is encoded in dilatations of @xmath129 and translations of @xmath68 and @xmath121 .",

    "in particular , the @xmath141- components of the transformed tangent vector @xmath142 is not constant anymore .",

    "we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ b = f , p ] ) indeed describes the general form of the tangent vectors .    from ( [ b = f , p ] )",

    "<S> the closed string dynamics in @xmath0 and @xmath1 is studied within the scheme of pohlmeyer reduction . in both spaces </S>",
    "<S> two different classes of string surfaces are specified by the structure of the fundamental quadratic forms . the first class in @xmath0 is associated with the standard lightcone gauge strings and the second class describes spiky strings and their conformal deformations on the virasoro coadjoint orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these orbits correspond to singular liouville fields with the monodromy matrixes @xmath2 . the first class in @xmath1 is parameterized by the liouville fields with vanishing chiral energy functional . </S>",
