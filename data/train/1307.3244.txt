    "@xmath0  carinae ( hereafter @xmath0  car ) is now recognized to be a massive binary system in a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath1 ) . the primary star , @xmath0  car  a , is in the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase , with a luminosity of @xmath2 and mass of about @xmath3 .",
    "it is surrounded by a massive stellar wind ( @xmath4  m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , @xmath7  kms@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that interacts with a companion , @xmath0  car  b , that has not been detected directly yet .",

    "@xmath0  car  b is in front of @xmath0  car  a at apastron , and the orbital angular momentum vector is parallel to the symmetry axis of the bipolar homunculus nebula that surrounds the system .",
    "projected on the sky , at apastron , the secondary star directly illuminates and photo - ionizes the circumstellar material within 1200 au of the binary system primarily to the northwest , where the material is primarily approaching the observer .",
    "the companion star spends most of the orbit near apastron , so that the undisturbed wind from @xmath0  car  a is located on the far side of the system , red - shifted as seen from earth , and largely unaffected by the ionizing radiation from @xmath0  car  b.    during periastron passage , @xmath0  car  b approaches within @xmath14 au of @xmath0  car  a , leading to rapid changes in the shape of the wind - wind interaction surface and confinement of the far - uv flux from @xmath0  car  b. hydrodynamical simulations ( * ? ? ?",

    "2013 , in preparation ) show that , after each periastron passage , a highly - distorted volume of hot , low density secondary wind pushes outward into the slow , high - density primary wind , leading to the formation of a thin , high density wall surrounding the lower density , trapped wind of @xmath0  car  b. this dense wall is accelerated to velocities somewhat higher than the terminal velocity of @xmath0  car  a and expands both in the orbital plane and perpendicular to it , creating a thin , high - density sheet of trapped primary wind material .",
    "using spectral imaging maps from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ stis _ ) , on board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) , we identify structures which are consistent with these walls of compressed primary wind material .",
    "we identify three partial arcs formed by the close passage of @xmath0  car  b around the primary star over the last 3 orbital cycles , and using the _ stis _ maps , we determine their space velocity and age .",
    "observations using _ hst / stis _ were accomplished through three guest observer programs , 12013 ( 2010 october 26 ) ,",
    "12508 ( 2011 november 20 ) , and 12750 ( 2012 october 18 ) , using the g430 m and g750 m gratings , centered at 4706  and 7283 , respectively , in combination with the @xmath15  aperture .",
    "an extended region , covering @xmath16 to @xmath17 , centered upon @xmath0  car , was mapped using @xmath18  spacing offsets at p.a .",
    "constrained by the spacecraft .",
    "exposures were approximately 30 seconds using crsplit=2 .",
    "an additional 7 position sub - map , also centered on @xmath0  car , employed shorter exposures to allow for potential saturation of continuum on the central positions .",
    "data were reduced with _",
    "gto http://www.exelisvis.com/productsservices/idl.aspx[]-based tools similar to the standard pipeline reduction tools @xcite , but with improved ability to spatially align the spectra to sub - pixel accuracy . for each emission line of interest ,",
    "continuum levels were fitted for each spatial position along the aperture and a re - sampled data cube was generated , with the coordinates of right ascension and declination at @xmath18  spacing , and doppler velocity at 20  kms@xmath6 intervals .    since we are interested in structures formed in the primary wind around periastron , here we focus only on the following low - ionization lines : [ ] ( @xmath19 , 4776.05 , 4815.88 , 7157.13 ) , are in  , in vacuum . ] and [ ] ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "observations from program 12013 ( 2010 october 26 ) did not include maps of [ ]  @xmath21 and [ ]  @xmath22 .",
    "visual examination of iso - velocity images in each data cube revealed multiple arcs in the low - ionization spectral lines used in this work .",
    "sample images are presented in figure  [ fig : panel ] for the [ ]  @xmath23 transition .",
    "these arcs are visible between p.a . @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we identified at least three sets of partial arcs , labelled a1 , a2 , and a3 in figure  [ fig : refimg ] .",
    "the two innermost arcs , a1 and a2 , are conspicuously detected in all of the transitions from [ ] and [ ] .",
    "the outermost arc , a3 , is very faint .",
    "these arcs are not artifacts of the hst / stis point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "hst / stis _ psf diffractive rings vary slowly with wavelength , are symmetric about the central core and have amplitudes substantially weaker than the partial rings apparent in the images @xcite .",
    "as shown in the discussion below , these features correlate with multiple forbidden line structures seen at different wavelengths , expanding away from the central source .",
    "comparison of the same iso - velocity image for different epochs ( 2010 october 26 , 2011",
    "november 20 , and 2012 october 18 ) revealed that a1 , a2 , and a3 move outward from the central source ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) . because a3 is faint and hard to see in all the images , and a1 is affected by uncertainties in the continuum subtraction method close to the central source",
    ", we concentrate our analysis on a2 .",
    "we note , however , that all three arcs seem to expand at the same rate , but some extended parts become very distorted or diluted , which makes the determination of accurate positions a difficult task .",
    "the position of the eastern portion of a2 , relative to the central source , was measured using a radial flux profile cut along its direction ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) . for each dataset ( 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 ) , we extracted the flux profile between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the emission from a2 is strongest .",
    "we used three different methods for measuring the peak position in the radial flux profile curve .",
    "the first is a simple gaussian model , which is a good approximation when the flux profile of the shell is somewhat symmetric .",
    "the second method relies on the barycenter of the flux profile , and the third , developed by @xcite , is based on the analysis of the derivative of the observed profile .",
    "the position of the peak is the median value of these methods .    a comprehensive study comparing several methods to determine peak positions with sub - pixel accuracy , including the three methods used here , was done by @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for further details .",
    "based upon the individual measurement errors , we estimate an accuracy of 0.25 pixel ( 0.013 ) for the position of the shell using the median value of the three methods mentioned before",
    ". the total error , however , may be larger than that because it is dominated by the dispersion in the measured position for various forbidden lines .",
    "we note that a2 is moving outwards with a proper motion @xmath28yr@xmath6 , on the plane of the sky ( figure  [ fig : posvel](a ) ) , a value suspiciously close to the pixel size . however , many other regions across the field of view are fixed in position from image to image , giving us confidence that the images are all spatially registered correctly .",
    "furthermore , the motion of portions of a2 depends on the local doppler velocity ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ fig : posvel](a ) ) .",
    "hence , the detected motion is not caused by a systematic misalignment of the images .",
    "the projected radius ( @xmath29 ) , at a given doppler velocity ( @xmath30 ) , of a shell moving with space velocity @xmath31 , during a time @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33    taking the difference of the projected radius of a2 , at two epochs separated by a time interval @xmath34 , leads to @xmath35    setting the observations made in 2010 oct .",
    "26 as baseline , we have @xmath36 and @xmath37  yr , for the two subsequent datasets .",
    "thus , we used the measured projected position for a2 in the range @xmath38  kms@xmath6 ( this is the small angle regime , where @xmath39 ) to estimate the space velocity , which resulted in @xmath40  kms@xmath6 .",
    "the age of a2 , @xmath41 , in 2010 , is thus obtained from @xmath42  yr , where @xmath43 is the average projected distance of a2 , relative to the central source , at that epoch .",
    "assuming that a1 is moving at the same constant space velocity as a2 , then , for a given epoch , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average projected distance of a1 from the central source , and @xmath46 is its age . in 2010 and 2011 , a1 was too close to the central source to be accurately measured .",
    "thus , we used the observations of 2012 to measure the position and then estimate the age . in 2012",
    ", we have @xmath47 , resulting in @xmath48  yr .",
    "the relation described in equation  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) also applies to a3 , resulting in @xmath49  yr , since it was observed at @xmath50 in 2012 .",
    "the rather large errors are dominated by uncertainties in the position due to the proximity to the central source for a1 , and the weak emission of a3 .    correcting for the time interval between the 2012 and 2010 observations , and comparing the ages in 2012 , we finally have @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53  yr .",
    "this means that each shell is created approximately 5.6  yr after the earlier one , showing that they are directly tied to the orbital period of the binary system ( @xmath54  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to test for the consistency of our results across the range of doppler velocities where a2 is observed , we adopted a simplified model in which we consider a2 to be part of a spherical shell centered on @xmath0  car , and allowed it to expand , at a constant space velocity of @xmath55  kms@xmath6 , during the corresponding age of a2 at each epoch of observations ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in figure  [ fig : posvel](a ) ) .    at line of sight velocities near zero ,",
    "a spherical model reproduces the observations very well , with standard deviations @xmath59",
    ". however , it fails to match the observed position of a2 at red - shifted velocities @xmath60  kms@xmath6 ; a2 moves slower than predicted .",
    "the final standard deviation for the spherical model is @xmath18 , in the range from @xmath61 to @xmath62  kms@xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : posvel](b ) shows the comparison between the observed and the expected motion of shells formed during various periastron passages , and moving at 475  kms@xmath6 .",
    "despite showing an offset between the expected and observed position at a given time , their slope are the same , which gives support to our derived space velocity and the assumption that the shells are expanding at the same rate .",
    "we used the critical density for each forbidden line , calculated using the http://www.chiantidatabase.org[chianti ] atomic database , to infer the typical local densities of the arcs .",
    "the outermost arc , a3 , seen in the [ ] transitions but weakly in the [ ] , must have a density in the range @xmath63  @xmath64 .",
    "the strong [ ] emission from a1 and a2 , indicates that their densities must be @xmath65  @xmath64 .    assuming that a2 is half a spherical shell ( _ cf . _",
    "figure[sim ] ) with average radius of @xmath66 ( projected distance from the central source , at zero doppler velocity , in 2010 ) and thickness @xmath67 ( since we can not spatially resolve the arcs ) , and using the critical density calculated before , we estimate a total mass of @xmath68  m@xmath5 , for solar metallicity .",
    "models for the primary star predict that its wind density should drop below @xmath69  @xmath64 for projected distances greater than 0.2  @xcite .",
    "since we detected arcs exceeding @xmath69  @xmath64 out to 0.6 , this is naturally explained by the primary wind being compressed  a factor of @xmath70  by the secondary wind during periastron passage .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the average age difference between the arcs is approximately @xmath71  yr , nicely matching the binary system s period .    the primary mass - loss rate required to produce a shell with the same mass and geometry as a2 , over a time interval equal to the binary s period , is @xmath72  m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , in agreement with the results from radiative transfer spectral modeling @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that our result must not be taken as a strict lower or upper limit , since the actual geometry and thickness of a2 may be different from what we assumed .",
    "simulations using 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( 3d sph ) reveal compressed regions of the primary wind formed during the periastron passages and maintained for multiple cycles by the hot , low density , residual secondary wind ( figure  [ sim ] ) .",
    "these simulations predict that these compressed regions accelerate from the primary wind terminal velocity ( @xmath73  kms@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to about @xmath74  kms@xmath6 ( t. madura et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . ) , which is consistent with our derived expansion velocity of @xmath55  kms@xmath6 for the shells .",
    "the departure from spherical symmetry for high red - shifted doppler velocities suggests that the shells do not expand with the same velocity in all directions .",
    "this is explained by the fact that 3d sph simulations show that material located in the orbital plane moves faster than material located off the plane .",
    "thus , the observed doppler velocity is a combination of velocities from different emitting regions along a specific viewing angle , which , in turn , depends upon the orientation of the shells on the sky , ultimately defined by the orbital orientation .    during periastron passages ,",
    "sph 3d simulations show that the secondary star creates a cavity deep within the primary wind , pushing a shell outwards .",
    "since the low density secondary wind is moving at @xmath75  kms@xmath6 , the interaction with the high density , relatively slow primary wind results in the formation of a high density , thin shell accelerated to velocities slightly higher than the terminal velocity of the primary wind .",
    "hence , the geometry of the shell is strongly affected by the physical parameters of the binary system , and the projected appearance on the sky is defined by the inclination of the orbital plane .",
    "the latitudinal extent of the shells is controlled by the asymptotic opening angle , @xmath76 , of the wind - wind collision region , given by @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the ratio of the secondary to the primary wind momentum , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity of the wind , and the subscript a and b refer to the primary and secondary star , respectively .",
    "assuming fixed parameters for the secondary wind , a large primary mass loss rate decreases the bow shock opening angle @xmath76 , so that the compressed primary wind material is trapped near the orbital plane ( figure[sim](c ) ) ; a low mass - loss rate increases @xmath76 , and the compressed primary wind can extend well off the orbital plane ( figure[sim](d ) ) .",
    "this means that the geometry of the circumstellar arcs is an excellent diagnostic of the primary mass - loss rate : a lower mass loss rates produces a nearly continuous arc seen in projection around the star , while a higher mass loss rate produces a shorter , broken arc .",
    "the existence of a discontinuity in the arcs that we observe , more pronounced in a1 as a lack of emission at p.a.@xmath81 , yields a lower limit to the mass - loss rate of the primary star .",
    "sph simulations in 3d show that such broken rings are only apparent if the primary mass - loss rate is above @xmath82  m@xmath5yr@xmath6 , which suggests that , at least for the last event , the primary mass - loss rate must have exceeded this value .",
    "our results also constrain the orbital orientation , with periastron occuring between @xmath83 , _",
    "i.e. _ , during periastron , the primary star is between the observer and the secondary star .",
    "the opposite configuration , where the secondary , at periastron , is between the observer and the primary star , would produce blue - shifted shells seen to the northwest of the central source , rather than the red - shifted features to the southeast that we observe .",
    "finally , we note that our results assume a constant shell space velocity .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure[fig : posvel](b ) , there is an offset of 0.07  between the expected and the observed distance from the central source as a function of time . we know , from the comparison between the derived space velocity ( 475  kms@xmath6 ) and the terminal velocity of the primary wind ( 420  kms@xmath6 ) , that this offset is due to the acceleration that these shells experienced at some point during the early stages of their formation .",
    "thus , the ages derived in this letter are overestimated , _",
    "i.e _ the shells are younger .",
    "nevertheless , the difference of 5.6  yr between them remains the same , validating their connection with the orbital period .",
