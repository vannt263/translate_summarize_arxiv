    "the cosmological constant has an interesting history .",
    "its pre - history dates back to 1896 , when von seeliger @xcite and neumann @xcite introduced an attenuation factor in the newtonian potential , @xmath30 , in order to resolve the non - convergence of the gravitational force in newtonian cosmology for an infinite homogeneous distribution of matter @xcite . in 1917",

    "lematre @xcite was the first to understand that the cosmological constant can be interpreted as a force of `` cosmic repulsion '' ( see also @xcite ) . in the newtonian context , the modified poisson equation including the cosmological constant is @xmath33 , leading to the homogeneous static solution @xmath34 .",
    "] after the discovery of the expansion of the universe , predicted theoretically by friedmann @xcite and lematre @xcite , and ascertained by the observations of hubble @xcite , einstein considered the cosmological constant as `` the biggest blunder of his life '' @xcite , and banished it .",
    "in 1932 , einstein and de sitter @xcite published a short paper describing the expansion of a pressureless universe without cosmological constant .",
    "this is the so - called einstein - de sitter ( eds ) model . in this model ,",
    "the universe undergoes a decelerating expansion .",
    "the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe in recent years @xcite revived the interest in the cosmological constant since a positive cosmological constant can precisely account for such an acceleration . )",
    "was first considered by de sitter @xcite in the context of a _",
    "static _ universe .",
    "it was understood later by lematre @xcite that de sitter s solution actually describes a universe expanding exponentially rapidly with time .",
    "] at present , the standard model of cosmology is based on a pressureless dark matter fluid ( @xmath35 ) with a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is the cold dark matter ( @xmath14cdm ) model . from the observations ,",
    "the cosmological constant has the value @xmath37 .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath14 is equivalent to a constant energy density @xmath38 , called dark energy , associated with an equation of state @xmath39 involving a negative pressure .",
    "some authors @xcite have proposed to interpret the cosmological constant in terms of the energy of the vacuum . however , when one tries to explain the cosmological constant in relation to the vacuum energy , one is confronted to the so - called `` cosmological constant problem '' @xcite because quantum field theory predicts that the vacuum energy density should be of the order of the planck density @xmath40 which is @xmath27 orders of magnitude larger than the value of the cosmological density @xmath41 deduced from the observations . to circumvent this problem",
    ", some authors have proposed to abandon the cosmological constant @xmath14 and to explain the acceleration of the universe in terms of a dark energy with a time - varying density associated to a scalar field called `` quintessence '' @xcite .",
    "this mysterious concept of `` dark energy '' adds to the other mysterious concept of `` dark matter '' necessary to account for the missing mass of the galaxies inferred from the virial theorem @xcite and to explain their flat rotation curves @xcite . as an alternative to quintessence , kamenshchik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a heuristic unification of dark matter and dark energy in terms of an exotic fluid with an equation of state @xmath42 , called the chaplygin gas .",
    "this equation of state provides a model of universe that behaves as a pressureless fluid ( dark matter ) at early times , and as a fluid with a constant energy density ( dark energy ) at late times , yielding an exponential acceleration similar to the effect of the cosmological constant .",
    "however , in the intermediate regime of interest , this model does not give a good agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , generalizations of the chaplygin gas have been considered @xcite .",
    "we note that an equation of state corresponding to a constant negative pressure @xmath43 also provides a heuristic unification of dark matter and dark energy , and is simpler @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this equation of state is consistent with the observations since it gives the same results as the @xmath14cdm model although its physical justification is different .",
    "therefore , we can realize a simple unification of dark matter and dark energy by assuming that the universe is filled with a single dark fluid with a constant pressure .",
    "however , this model has two drawbacks .",
    "since it has no free parameter , it can not account for ( small ) deviations from the @xmath14cdm model . on the other hand ,",
    "a constant equation of state can not describe dark matter halos .",
    "indeed , since there is no pressure gradient ( @xmath44 ) , this model behaves similarly to the cdm model where @xmath35 , and generates cuspy density profiles at the center of the halos @xcite .",
    "this is problematic because observations of dark matter halos favor density cores instead of cusps @xcite .",
    "cores can be naturally explained by assuming that dark matter halos are collisional and that they are described by an equation of state @xmath45 that strictly increases with the density so that pressure gradients can counterbalance the gravitational attraction .",
    "therefore , if we want to realize a successful unification of dark matter and dark energy , the idea is to consider a dark fluid with an equation of state @xmath45 increasing slowly with the density .",
    "a natural idea is to consider a polytropic equation of state where the pressure is a power of the density with a small index @xmath46 .",

    "by contrast , in the usual inflationary scenario @xcite , the temperature decreases during the inflation and one must advocate a phase of re - heating ( not very well understood ) to account for the observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the polytropic model generates a value of the entropy as large as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to introduce a generalized polytropic model based on a quadratic equation of state that describes simultaneously the early inflation , the intermediate decelerating expansion , and the late acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "] however , this distinction is only asymptotic and , in the intermediate regime , it is not possible to separate these two components unambiguously because they do not appear additively in the energy density @xmath4 unless @xmath55 , which is equivalent to the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "model ii corresponds to an equation of state of the form @xmath56 with @xmath48 , where the pressure is a power of the rest - mass density . in this model , the energy density @xmath4 is the sum of two terms : a rest - mass energy @xmath57 and an internal energy @xmath58 . since @xmath59 ,",
    "the rest mass term mimics dark matter .",
    "when @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , the internal energy term mimics dark energy .",
    "this decomposition leads to a natural , and physical , unification of dark matter and dark energy , and elucidates their mysterious nature . in order to account for the observations",
    ", these polytropic models must be relatively close to the @xmath14cdm model , equivalent to a constant negative pressure .",
    "this implies that the polytropic index @xmath60 must be close to zero . for @xmath55 ( i.e. @xmath61 )",
    ", we recover the @xmath14cdm model exactly . for @xmath60 different from zero",
    ", we can study deviations from the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "the polytropic models have been confronted to the observations in order to constrain the values of the admissible index @xmath60 or @xmath62 . for model",
    "i , it is found that @xmath63 @xcite . for model",
    "ii , it is found that @xmath64 ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) @xcite .",
    "although these polytropic models are interesting in themselves , we anticipate a problem in order to _ justify _ them from a fundamental theory . actually , it is possible to justify a polytropic equation of state by assuming that the dark fluid is made of a self - interacting scalar field representing , for example , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "a polytropic equation of state with @xmath66 arises from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with a power - law potential @xmath67 or from the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation with a power - law potential @xmath68 .",
    "however , it is hard to imagine how one can justify from fundamental arguments why the universe is described by a polytropic equation of state with a `` curious '' index equal , for example , to @xmath69 . the most natural value of the polytropic index is @xmath55 corresponding to a constant pressure but , in that case , the gp and kg equations degenerate .",
    "furthermore , a polytropic equation of state with @xmath55 has no pressure gradient , which is problematic to account for the flat core of dark matter halos as previously mentioned .    in this paper",
    ", we develop another idea that was sketched in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "we propose to describe the universe by a single dark fluid with a logotropic equation of state of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rest - mass density , @xmath2 is a reference density , and @xmath3 is the logotropic temperature .",
    "this equation of state was introduced phenomenologically in astrophysics by mclaughlin and pudritz @xcite to describe the internal structure and the average properties of molecular clouds and clumps .",
    "it was also studied by chavanis and sire @xcite in the context of tsallis generalized thermodynamics @xcite where it was shown to correspond to a polytropic equation of state with @xmath70 and @xmath71 in such a way that @xmath72 is finite . as a generalized temperature associated with a generalized entropy called log - entropy @xcite ( see appendix [ sec_log ] ) . ]",
    "this limit is very relevant to the present cosmological context because we precisely require an equation of state with a polytropic exponent close to @xmath55 . _",
    "therefore , the logotropic equation of state is a natural , and serious , candidate for the unification of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "_ since the pressure must increase with the density , the logotropic temperature must be strictly positive ( @xmath73 ) which is satisfying from a thermodynamical point of view . in the early universe , the dark",
    "fluid behaves as pressureless dark matter ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and , in the late universe , it behaves as dark energy ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the logotropic model depends on a single parameter @xmath11 ( dimensionless logotropic temperature ) , where @xmath74 is the cosmological density . for @xmath13",
    ", we recover the @xmath14cdm model with a different justification . for @xmath15",
    ", we can describe deviations from the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "using cosmological constraints , we find that @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath75 , the universe is normal for @xmath76 ( the energy density decreases as the scale factor increases ) and becomes phantom afterwards ( the energy density increases with the scale factor ) . actually , the logotropic model breaks down before entering in the phantom regime because the velocity of sound exceeds the velocity of light when @xmath77 .",
    "however , this moment is quite remote in the future .    since the logotropic equation of state",
    "is expected to provide a unification of dark energy and dark matter , it should also describe the structure of dark matter halos . in this respect ,",
    "the logotropic equation of state has several nice properties .",
    "first of all , since the pressure increases with the density , pressure gradients prevent gravitational collapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles , in agreement with the observations @xcite . on the other hand , the universal rotation curve of logotropic dark matter halos is consistent with the observational burkert profile @xcite up to the halo radius . while the burkert density decreases as @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , we note that the profile of dark matter halos close to the core radius decreases as @xmath17 @xcite in agreement with the logotropic profile .",
    "on the other hand , some galaxies such as low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have rotation curves that strictly increase with the distance .",
    "these galaxies are particularly well isolated and little affected by tidal effects . in other cases , tidal effects or complex physical processes ( e.g. incomplete relaxation ) have to be taken into account",
    ". this can affect the behavior of the density profile and of the rotation curve at large distances and explain how we pass from a @xmath17 behavior to a @xmath78 behavior . ] finally , and very interestingly , if we assume that all the dark matter halos have the same logotropic temperature @xmath18 ( a consequence of our model ) , we find that their surface density @xmath79 is constant .",
    "this result is in agreement with the observations , where it is found that @xmath80 has the same value @xmath81 for dark matter halos differing by several orders of magnitude in size @xcite , a result unexplained so far . using this observational result",
    ", we obtain @xmath21 .",
    "then , we show that the mass enclosed within a sphere of fixed radius @xmath22 has the same value @xmath23 for all the dwarf halos , in agreement with the observations of strigari _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "this so far unexplained result is a direct consequence of the logotropic equation of state . finally , assuming that @xmath24 , where @xmath82 is the planck density , we _ predict _ @xmath21 , in perfect agreement with the value obtained from the observations .",
    "we approximately have @xmath26 $ ] where @xmath27 is the famous number occurring in the ratio @xmath28 between the planck density @xmath83 and the cosmological density @xmath12 .",
    "this value of @xmath18 is sufficiently low to satisfy the cosmological bound @xmath84 and sufficiently large to differ from cdm ( @xmath13 ) and avoid density cusps in dark matter halos .",
    "therefore , a logotropic equation of state is a good candidate to account both for galactic and cosmological observations .",
    "this may be a hint that dark matter and dark energy are the manifestation of a single dark fluid .",
    "finally , it may be less problematic to theoretically justify the logotropic model than a polytropic model with an index @xmath69 for example @xcite .",
    "indeed , the logotropic equation of state has a universal functional form ( logarithmic ) while the polytropic model depends on an unknown index @xmath60 . as shown in detail below",
    ", the logotropic model removes the degeneracy of the polytropic model when @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , there is some hope to justify the logotropic model from a fundamental field theory .",
    "if we assume that the dark fluid is made of a self - interacting scalar field , representing for example becs , we find that the logotropic equation of state arises from the gp equation with an inverted quadratic potential @xmath85 or from the kg equation with a logarithmic potential @xmath86 . to our knowledge",
