    "we start by defining the `` strong - coupling limit '' of this model , in which the interaction strengths are large compared to the one - electron energies . here",

    "[ app : strong ] we present details and prove that the statements we make here are asymptotically exact in this limit .    by the strong coupling limit",
    "we formally mean that we consider the model in the limit @xmath28 , where all the interactions , @xmath29 and the hopping matrix elements , @xmath21 and @xmath30",
    ". even in this limit , the physics depends on the finite ratios of the various interaction strengths . in particular",
    ", we will always assume that the following inequalities are satisfied : @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , consistent with chemical intuition .",
    "( somewhat more restrictive inequalities must be assumed in order to prove all the stated results , as is discussed explicitly in appendix a. ) finally , since the hopping matrix elements depend exponentially on separation , we set @xmath33",

    "of course , this degeneracy is resolved for finite interaction strengths when antiferromagnetic super - exchange interactions , with @xmath38 , are included . however , in the strong - coupling limit , this ( and most of the other spin - physics we will encounter ) involves energy scales that vanish as @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; we will therefore ignore this physics at first , and then return to it when we consider ",

    "is that if the doped hole is added to an oxygen on a given row , all states with energy near @xmath46 involve disturbances which are confined to the same row .",
    "any state which involves a non - colinear disturbance , such as the bent - hole exciton in [ states]e , costs infinite energy in the strong coupling limit .    in this limit , therefore , the number of holes on each row and each column of the lattice are separately conserved quantities , and the charge dynamics is purely one - dimensional .",
    "more precisely , in appendix [ app : strong ] we show that , to leading order in the strong coupling expansion and for @xmath52 , each row @xmath53 has a conserved quantity @xmath54 , and each column @xmath55 a conserved quantity @xmath56 , which qualitatively correspond the number of hole quasiparticles on that row or column .",

    "an important qualitative point to recognize here is that the fermi pressure is a decreasing function of @xmath35 which vanishes as @xmath81 .",
    "various correlation functions can be accurately estimated , as well , from the well known theory of the 1d luttinger liquid .    for @xmath82",
    ", the system is again insulating , with one hole on each site . expanding about this limit ,",
    "for @xmath83 small , yields a result similar to those obtained for small @xmath26 .",
    "other interesting states occur in the vicinity of various commensurate values of @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , @xmath84 corresponds to commensurability 2 in the spinless fermion problem , where an incompressible cdw state is the ground state of this strongly interacting problem .",
    "indeed , given the large number of exact , or well controlled approximate results that can be obtained for the 1deg , and the ease with which quantum monte - carlo simulations can be employed to flesh out the analytic results quantitatively , we consider the problem of a single , cu - o row to be a solved problem .",
    "this also means that a large number of `` fully nematic '' states can also be completely characterized . a fully nematic state is defined to be one in which which doped holes are placed only on rows ( or only on columns ) . since holes on neighboring rows do not interact at all ( unless we were to add longer range interactions to the model ) , the dynamics of the holes on each row are determined by the same 1d hamiltonian we have just analyzed . this does not constitute a complete solution of the problem , since states in which some doped holes lie on rows , and others on columns are still complicated , and require additional analysis to characterize .",
    "however , we will show below that , under many circumstances , the ground state is fully nematic .",
    "we now move from the analysis of the hole dynamics along a single row or column , to study the phases of the full two - dimensional model .      at @xmath82",
    "there are two holes per unit cell , and in the ground state each cu and o site along each row is occupied by exactly one hole , while the o sites along columns are empty .",
    "the energy per unit cell of this state is @xmath85 .",
    "there is a second , degenerate , ground state obtained by exchanging rows and columns .",
    "each ground state spontaneously breaks the the @xmath86 rotational invariance of the square lattice but is translationally invariant since all unit cells are equivalent .",
    "furthermore these strong coupling ground states at @xmath82 have a charge gap .",
    "hence this phase is a _",
    "nematic insulator_.      in this limit ( still with @xmath88 ) the _ charge _ degrees of freedom define a classical lattice gas which can be mapped precisely to an antiferromagnetic ising model on the oxygen lattice with exchange coupling @xmath89 . here",
    "spin - up indicates an occupied state and spin down an unoccupied state . under this mapping ,",
    "the magnetization of the ising model is @xmath90 and the nel state is the insulating nematic state .",
    "the phase diagram of this model , shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , is well known  @xcite . for @xmath91 ,",
    "there is a continuous finite temperature transition from a high temperature disordered phase to the low temperature nel phase .",
    "however , at a critical @xmath92 , there is a tricritical point , such that for @xmath93 the transition is discontinuous . at low temperatures , for any @xmath94 ,",
    "there is two - phase coexistence between a ferromagnetic ( @xmath36 mott - insulating ) and a nel ( @xmath82 insulating nematic ) phase .    at elevated temperatures ,",
    "this classical phase diagram is relatively insensitive to the addition of perturbations to the hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , even for @xmath95 , the phase diagram is hardly altered by quantum effects so long as @xmath96 . however , at low temperatures , additional longer range interactions , either added explicitly to the model or induced by quantum fluctuations , can affect the nature of the stable phases substantially .",
    "for instance , even at the classical level , including the effect of weak coulomb repulsion between holes on second - neighbor o orbitals will stabilize an electronic crystalline phase in a narrow range of @xmath26 near @xmath97 and at low enough temperatures . here",
    "the doped holes form a period 2 ( wigner crystal ) density wave along each row , while the o s along vertical bonds remain undoped . more generally , at low @xmath98 and intermediate @xmath26 , the phase diagram is complex and dependent on details .",
    "however , for @xmath26 near 0 or 1 , we will see that quantum effects generically stabilize homogeneous quantum nematic phases , shown as shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      at low temperatures , @xmath102 , quantum effects are important , even for small @xmath103 .",
    "we start by addressing the nature of the low temperature phase for @xmath100 .",
    "since the doped - holes are fermions , one would generally expect an associated fermi pressure which tends to favor a uniform state . as shown in eq.([fermipressure ] ) , the 1d dynamics of the doped holes imply that the fermi pressure @xmath104 , rather than the stronger @xmath105 dependence of a 2d fermi gas . however , absent any attractive effective interactions between doped holes the fermi pressure is always sufficient to stabilize a uniform phase at small @xmath26 .",
    "( effective attractions can arise from magnetic fluctuations but are negligible at strong coupling . )    more specifically , an upper - bound to the ground state energy per site , @xmath106 , at all @xmath26 is given by the energy of the fully nematic state , @xmath107 , _ i.e. _ the ground state energy of the 1d emery model computed from eq.([hrow ] ) or eq.([hc ] ) .",
    "it can easily be imagined that there is an isotropic state ( or a less nematic nematic state ) that has lower energy .",
    "however , while the properties of such an isotropic state can not be computed exactly , a simple estimate shows that for @xmath108 , the ground state is always nematic .    to see this",
    ", we compare the energy of the nematic phase with that of an isotropic version of this phase . if we ignore the interactions between doped holes on rows and columns , the isotropic phase would have lower energy , since there are twice as many 1d systems each with 1/2 the density of doped holes , resulting in a factor of 4 reduction in the fermi pressure .",
    "now , for @xmath26 small enough , the contributions to the ground state energy from the @xmath20 coupling between holes on crossing cu - o rows and columns is a is regular function of @xmath26 , free of infrared divergences .",
    "in particular , when two doped holes approach each other at the intersection of a row and column , the repel each other strongly , and the probability of such an interaction is proportional to @xmath109 . thus , the energy per site of the nematic state is @xmath110 , while that of the isotropic state is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is an effective repulsion between holes on intersecting rows and columns .",
    "manifestly , at small enough @xmath26 , the nematic state has lower energy .",
    "the fermi pressure similarly stabilizes the uniform phase for @xmath91 . here",
    "the nematic character of the resulting uniform phase is considerably more obvious : the nematic phase consists of an array of luttinger liquids ( one per row ) with an effective luttinger charge parameter @xmath113 and an effective charge velocity @xmath114 .",
    "low order corrections to the strong coupling limit resolve the spin - degeneracies we have neglected , and produce other important changes in the physics , which we will discuss elsewhere ; here we comment on a few salient features .      in the undoped mott insulator at @xmath36 ,",
    "the most obvious induced interaction @xcite is the super - exchange interaction between nearest - neighbor cu spins , which to leading ( 4@xmath115 ) order in @xmath45 is @xmath116\\{1+(u_p+2\\epsilon)/(2u_d)\\}$ ] .",
    "however , unlike the one - band model , under some circumstances , for the strong coupling limit of the emery model other higher order interactions can be comparable in magnitude to this interaction . thus , there is a 4-spin ring exchange interaction on a plaquette generated at 8@xmath115 order , which does not vanish for @xmath117 .",
    "( for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we get @xmath120 while the leading order contribution to @xmath121 is @xmath122 . ) thus , whereas the mott insulating ground state at @xmath36 of the single band model is inevitably magnetically ordered , the emery model has , in addition , quantum disordered ( likely dimerized ) phases .      for any of the conducting phases discussed above , the corrections to strong coupling not only resolve the spin degeneracies , but also lead to important changes in the charge dynamics at asymptotically low energies . in particular , under most circumstances , we expect that the peculiar non - fermi liquid behavior resulting from the strictly 1d dynamics of the strong coupling limit will be destroyed at vanishing temperatures by induced interactions ( either proportional to @xmath22 or @xmath123 ) which permit holes to hop from a row to a column .",
    "these couplings will either lead to a crossover to fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures , or to a broken symmetry ground state .",
    "however , so long as these interactions are weak , they can not restore the point group symmetry , so the nematic character of the resulting states should be robust @xcite .",
    "moreover , as is characteristic of quasi 1d systems , the non - fermi liquid character will still be manifest at non - zero temperatures , energies , or wave - vectors .",
    "the fact that the model considered has regions of two - phase coexistence , and others where various susceptibilities ( including the compressibility ) are large , means that the low temperature physics can be strongly modified by the effect of even weak additional interactions . of these",
    ", the most obvious is the long - range coulomb interaction , which always frustrates phase separation and instead results in various locally inhomogeneous phases such as stripe and bubble phases .      at least at strong coupling , the mott insulating state at @xmath36 is strongly particle - hole asymmetric : added electrons ( @xmath124 ) remove holes from the cu sites ; these  doped electrons \" have no local tendency to be dynamically confined to rows or columns .",
    "it has long been accepted that the emery model provides a reasonable description of the relevant electronic degrees of freedom in the cuprates . in this paper , we have obtained theoretically well controlled results in a strong coupling regime of this model . although cluster calculations suggest that this limit may not be entirely appropriate in the real materials , the insights obtained here may nevertheless capture important features of the physics .",
    "perhaps the most salient feature of the results obtained here is the existence of a strongly nematic phase in a significant portion of the phase diagram .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of the same model in the weak coupling limit , where it behaves in similar fashion to the single band hubbard model in which such a phase , if it occurs at all , is confined to special fillings associated with the proximity to van hove singularities  @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of the existence of a nematic phase  @xcite in the cuprates was recently reviewed in ref .",
    "the other feature of the phase diagram is the existence of a large region of two - phase coexistence - phase separation .",
    "this may be the simplest example of a generic tendency of highly correlated systems to form inhomogeneous states  @xcite .",

    "it is apparent from the structure of the cu - o lattice , that for every cu site @xmath0 it is possible to define four triangles , located respectively ne , nw , sw and se of the cu site , and each having the cu site and two adjacent o sites for its vertices ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) . we will label a triangle @xmath137 according to its cu vertex @xmath0 and by a pair of labels @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath140 corresponds to the triangle ne of @xmath0 , @xmath141 to the triangle nw , etc .",
    "we denote by @xmath142 the total hole occupancy of triangle @xmath143 : @xmath144 by using this notation we can equivalently write @xmath135 in terms of the hole occupancy of each triangle and of the occupancy of the cu and o sites :        ( strictly , in the strong coupling limit , violating the inequalities of eq .",
    "[ eq : ineq ] can lead to major restructuring of the ground state .",
    "for instance , for @xmath146 , the system phase will separate for any @xmath147 , albeit if @xmath45 is not infinitesimal , quantum effects may lead to inhomogeneous ordered states . indeed , close to the `` fully frustrated '' point @xmath148 , interesting forms of quantum order - from - disorder effects can arise .",

    "all other states are separated from these zero energy states by a finite energy gap .",

    "( @xmath151 is the total number of cu sites on this lattice . )    to analyze the strong coupling limit to lowest order in perturbation theory , we confine our attention to the zero energy subspace of the full hilbert space .",

    "<S> we show that there exists a limit ( which is not wildly unphysical ) of the emery model about which a number of exact statements are possible . specifically , despite the fact that the model itself possesses the symmetries of the square lattice , the electron dynamics is quasi - one - dimensional in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to establish the existence of various electronic liquid crystalline phases @xcite , including especially an ising- nematic phase @xcite which spontaneously breaks the four - fold rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice . </S>"
