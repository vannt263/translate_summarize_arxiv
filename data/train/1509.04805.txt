    "commercial wireless networks are evolving towards higher frequency reuse by deploying smaller cells to meet increasing demand for mobile data services . in a heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) , macro cells provide for wide area coverage and for serving highly mobile users , whereas dense deployment of femto , pico , and/or micro cells , possibly with distributed antennas , can support much higher data rates per unit area .",
    "the energy consumption due to information and communication technologies worldwide is rising rapidly  @xcite .",
    "as the number of base transceiver stations ( btss ) increases , it is ever more important to manage their energy consumption .",
    "an active macro bts consumes 40 to 80 watts on transmission , whereas the total power consumption is typically hundreds to well over 1,000 watts , which includes the power for signal processing , computation , cooling , and radio frequency power amplification ( see , e.g. , @xcite  and references therein ) .",
    "hence , savings from transmit power control alone are relatively limited .",
    "much more significant power savings can be accomplished by turning a bts off or switching it to deep sleep mode . in this paper , we study how to support given traffic with as few active small cells as possible to conserve energy in a hetnet . because it may take many seconds to reactivate a bts in deep sleep  @xcite , the on - off decision should rely on the _ aggregate _ traffic and average channels conditions collected over a period , possibly lasting a minute or more .",
    "cell activation / deactivation thus occurs on a much slower timescale than channel - aware scheduling , which typically occurs over time slots of a few milliseconds  @xcite .",
    "the central problem considered here is how to jointly optimize spectrum allocation and user association to minimize the number of active cells . without loss of generality , we focus on downlink data transmissions .",
    "the problem formulation in this paper builds upon prior work  @xcite .",
    "the following two features distinguish this paper and  @xcite from most existing work on energy - efficient resource management in the literature , including  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider stochastic packet arrivals to user traffic queues in lieu of static data rate requirements .",
    "stochastic traffic better models the challenges for small cells as they have much more pronounced traffic variations than macro cells .",
    "the proposed slow timescale resource management adapts to the average traffic load , thus avoiding frequent on / off updates due to varying user equipment ( ue ) data rates .",
    "second , the formulation here facilitates the maximum amount of spectrum agility .",
    "specifically , by considering all possible reuse patterns , arbitrary ( possibly nonconsecutive ) spectrum can be allocated to a link from any bts to any ue ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the full - spectrum reuse ( i.e. , all btss use all available spectrum ) assumed in  @xcite .",
    "the optimization problem formulated here is a mixed integer program , where cell activation decisions are expressed as binary variables .",
    "the problem is solved numerically using an iterative algorithm based on reweighted @xmath0 minimization  @xcite .",
    "the method was interpreted as majorization - minimization in  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite uses the same method to solve the cell activation and user association problem under full - spectrum reuse and static rate requirements .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed resource management method achieves significant energy savings as well as throughput gains in a typical hetnet .",
    "in particular , the performance advantages of spectrum agility is demonstrated by comparing with the method in  @xcite . as previously noted in  @xcite ,",
    "spectrum agility is crucial for improving network throughput .",
    "intuitively , improved spectrum allocation allows more btss to be turned off .",
    "furthermore , a silent bts causes no interference to other cells , so that the remaining btss may attain higher spectral efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "this may present additional opportunities for turning off btss and adding more energy savings .",
    "the proposed method offers a different tradeoff between performance and complexity than in  @xcite .",
    "the scheme in  @xcite is computationally feasible for a hetnet with hundreds of btss , whereas the method here is feasible for a cluster of at most 20 to 30 btss due to a large number of additional spectrum allocation variables in the optimization problem .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section  [ sec : sysmod ] .",
    "the optimization problems are presented in section  [ sec : opt ] , and the algorithms are introduced in section  [ sec : alg ] .",
    "simulation results are presented in section  [ sec : sim ] , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we consider the downlink of a hetnet with @xmath1 btss , including @xmath2 macro btss and @xmath3 pico btss .",
    "denote the set of macro and pico btss as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the set of all the btss .",
    "all btss operate on the same licensed band of @xmath7 hz .",
    "the frequency resources are assumed to be homogenous on a slow timescale .",
    "the key to total spectrum agility is the notion of _ pattern _  @xcite .",
    "a pattern over a set of time - frequency resources is a subset of transmitters sharing the resources . in the downlink ,",
    "a pattern @xmath8 is a subset of @xmath9 , and all btss in @xmath8 have simultaneous access to the frequency band associated with the pattern . assuming known transmit power spectral densities ( psds )",
    ", a particular pattern determines the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) and hence the spectral efficiencies of all links in the network .",
    "the allocation problem can then be formulated as how to divide the resources among all @xmath10 patterns . in a simple example with only 2 btss , there are only patterns : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which denote the patterns used respectively by bts 1 and bts 2 exclusively , the pattern used by both btss , and the pattern used by none , respectively . for every pattern @xmath15 ,",
    "let @xmath16 be the fraction of total bandwidth allocated to it .",
    "clearly , @xmath17 and any efficient allocation would set @xmath18 .",
    "macro btss , @xmath19 randomly deployed pico btss and @xmath20 user groups . ]    at the slow timescale considered it is reasonable to treat users near each other with similar quality of service ( qos ) requirements as a _",
    "group_. denote the set of all user groups as @xmath21 . an example hetnet model with @xmath22 btss and @xmath20 user groups",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topo ] , where each group of ues is assumed to be located at the center of each hexagon ( as in  @xcite ) . for ease of characterizing the delay as the objective ,",
    "the aggregate traffic of group @xmath23 ues is modeled by poisson traffic arrivals with arrival rate @xmath24 .",
    "the packet length is exponentially distributed with average length @xmath25 .",
    "it is possible to adopt a different traffic and queueing model ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume each bts assigns different spectrum resources to different user groups .",
    "this can be viewed as statistically multiplexing the packet streams from different user groups .",
    "the packets from the same group of ues are served according to a ` first in first out ' policy .",
    "hence , each user group effectively has a virtual queue .",
    "we also assume multiple btss can serve the same group of ues .",
    "we assume bts @xmath26 transmits to its ues with fixed flat transmit psd , @xmath27 .",
    "the spectral efficiency of the link @xmath28 under pattern @xmath8 depends on the receive power and the interference .",
    "for concreteness in obtaining numerical results , we use shannon s formula to obtain : @xmath29 in packets / second , where @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 otherwise , @xmath33 is the power gain of the link @xmath28 , and @xmath34 is the noise psd at group @xmath23 ues . the link gain @xmath33 includes pathloss and shadowing effects over the slow timescale considered in this paper . hence @xmath33 is a constant in each decision period independent of the frequency .",
    "if small scale fading is included in @xmath33 on the slow timescale , then ergodic spectral efficiency must be used instead of  , since the decision period spans many coherence time intervals .",
    "all packets intended for group @xmath23 ues arrive at an m / m/1 queue .",
    "denote the bandwidth allocated to bts @xmath26 to serve group @xmath23 ues under pattern @xmath8 as @xmath35 .",
    "the service rate for this queue contributed by bts @xmath26 under pattern @xmath8 is @xmath36 .",
    "this rate is guaranteed regardless of the activities of the other btss and queues .",
    "the total service rate for queue @xmath23 is a linear function of the bandwidths : @xmath37hence the average packet sojourn time of the m / m/1 queue for group @xmath23 ues takes a simple form  @xcite : @xmath38where @xmath39 , so @xmath40 if @xmath41 .",
    "the basic energy - efficient resource allocation problem is formulated as :    p1 [ eq : opt ] @xmath42    where :    * the variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the vector forms of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "* is the total energy cost of the network , where @xmath51 constrained by   is a binary variable indicating whether pico bts @xmath26 is on or off , and @xmath52 is the power cost of pico bts @xmath26 if it is active .",
    "while the macro btss are assumed to be always on to provide basic coverage , it is easy to include their on - off decisions as variables as well .",
    "* is the service rate of each user group as given in  . *",
    "guarantees that , for every pattern @xmath8 , the total bandwidth a bts allocates to all groups does not exceed the bandwidth assigned to pattern @xmath8 . *",
    "states that a pico bts @xmath26 uses no spectrum if it is off and uses at most 1 unit of bandwidth if it is on . *   * is the qos constraint for each user group , where @xmath53 is the maximum delay allowed for group @xmath23 ues . the constraint is equivalent to letting @xmath54 in   satisfy @xmath55 . in lieu of qos , quality of experience ( qoe )",
    "can be considered using the proposed framework as well . to achieve this",
    ", each user group can be further divided into smaller groups representing different rate , delay and other qos preferences .",
    "also , qoe may be modeled a general user - dependent utility function @xmath56 .",
    "* constrains the total system bandwidth to be one unit .",
    "the formulation  [ eq : opt ] addresses joint user association , spectrum allocation , and bts activation all under one framework . the objective and all the constraints",
    "are linear .",
    "solving  [ eq : opt ] minimizes the energy cost by turning off pico btss not needed to satisfy the delay requirements .",
    "one concern with  [ eq : opt ] is that the spectrum is divided into up to @xmath10 patterns ( segments ) , which may be impractical for all but very small networks .",
    "fortunately , we can use carathodory s theorem to show that there exists an optimal allocation that uses no more than @xmath57 patterns .",
    "[ thm : spec ] there exists an optimal solution of  [ eq : opt ] in which @xmath45 is @xmath57-sparse , i.e. , @xmath58    we first reformulate  [ eq : opt ] by defining a new set of variables @xmath59 , which represent the fraction of spectrum under pattern @xmath8 that bts @xmath26 allocates to group @xmath23 . the constraints   then become :    p2 [ eq : p2 ] @xmath60    this problem ,  [ eq : p2 ] , where @xmath59 replaces @xmath61 , is clearly equivalent to  [ eq : opt ] . solving  [ eq : p2 ] , the actual spectrum allocations are given by @xmath62 .    in the remainder of this proof , we show that if a solution @xmath63 to  [ eq : p2 ] exists , then there exists a @xmath57-sparse @xmath64 and rate tuple @xmath65 such that @xmath66 is feasible .",
    "this attains the original objective   because @xmath46 remains the same .",
    "we shall verify the feasibility constraints pertaining to @xmath67 , including  ,  ,  , and  .",
    "suppose @xmath45 has more than @xmath57 nonzero elements .",
    "let its support be @xmath68 ( @xmath69 if @xmath70 ) .",
    "let us define a @xmath57-vector @xmath71 for every @xmath72 with its elements determined by @xmath73 .",
    "according to  , a convex combination of the vectors @xmath74 with @xmath75 as coefficients form the optimal rate tuple : @xmath76 by carathodory s theorem , @xmath43 can be represented as a convex combination of no more than @xmath77 of those vectors , denoted as @xmath78 . moreover , either @xmath43 is on the boundary of the convex hull of @xmath79 or it is an interior point . in either case , there exists @xmath65 on the boundary that dominates @xmath43 in every dimension . clearly , @xmath65 is the convex combination of at most @xmath57 vectors from @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , there exists @xmath64 satisfying   with support @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 which implies  . because @xmath65 dominates @xmath43 in every dimension ,   is satisfied .",

    "requires that @xmath85 for every @xmath23 and every @xmath72 with @xmath86 , which implies that   remains true for @xmath64 , because its support is dominated by that of @xmath45 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the algorithm to be introduced for solving  [ eq : opt ] is related to the majorization - minimization approach in  @xcite , which is based on reweighted @xmath0 minimization proposed in  @xcite . to facilitate a fair comparison ,",
    "we formulate an analogous problem to the one in  @xcite for cell activation and user association under the current framework . with minor changes ,",
    "the optimization problem in  @xcite becomes :    p3 [ eq : opt2 ] @xmath87    where all variables have the same physical meaning as in  [ eq : opt ] . the key change from  [ eq : opt ] to  [ eq : opt2 ]",
    "is that only full spectrum reuse is allowed , where the spectral efficiency of the link @xmath28 is @xmath88 .",
    "[ eq : opt2 ] optimizes user association and the pico bts on / off selection to minimize the energy cost .",
    "the performance of allocations based on  [ eq : opt ] and  [ eq : opt2 ] will be compared in section  [ sec : sim ] using numerical examples .",
    "the objective   is equal to the weighted @xmath89 norm of @xmath46 : @xmath90 where for any real number @xmath91 , @xmath92 if @xmath93 and @xmath94 otherwise .",
    "hence [ eq : opt ] admits an equivalent formulation with the objective function changed to   and with   relaxed to @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96 .",
    "[ eq : opt ] can also be generalized to utility functions of the form : @xmath97 subject to the same constraints , where @xmath98}$ ] indicates the fraction of the total bandwidth used by bts @xmath26 .",
    "the objective   is highly versatile .",
    "for example , letting @xmath99 accounts for the transmit power consumption being proportional to the bandwidth allocation ; letting @xmath100 incorporates the cost of delay in the objective , where @xmath101 accounts for the tradeoff between energy and delay .",
    "with the weighted @xmath89 norm   as its objective , [ eq : opt ] is a mixed integer program .",
    "it is generally difficult to solve due to its combinatorial nature .",
    "such optimization problems frequently appear in sparse signal recovery , portfolio optimization , and statistical estimation . in this paper , we present an algorithm based on a low - complexity method , called _ reweighted @xmath0 minimization _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic algorithm for solving  [ eq : opt ] consists of iterating between solving a convex optimization problem with weighted @xmath0 norm relaxation of the @xmath89 objective  , and updating the weights .",
    "the continuous convex optimization problem based on @xmath0 relaxation is :    p4 [ eq : opt3 ] @xmath102    where the objective function becomes a weighted @xmath0 norm of @xmath46 in lieu of the weighted @xmath89 norm .",
    "compute @xmath103 and the corresponding optimum @xmath104 by solving  [ eq : opt3 ] with @xmath105 as the weights . 2 .",
    "update the weights by @xmath106 .",
    "3 . @xmath107 .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] states the iterative procedure .",
    "it starts with the weights @xmath108 as a vector of all ones . in the @xmath109th iteration",
    ", the algorithm first computes @xmath103 by solving   with @xmath110 as the weights .",
    "in fact , this is a simple linear program .",
    "the weights are then updated as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is some small number . if @xmath113 , the weight @xmath114 is the inverse of @xmath51 .",
    "hence @xmath115 is a good approximation of @xmath116 .",
    "we can also view @xmath114 as a penalty term . if @xmath117 is large , then @xmath118 , whereas if @xmath117 is small , then @xmath119 , so that @xmath51 is more likely to be driven to 0 in the following iteration .",
    "the algorithm terminates if either the maximum number of iterations @xmath120 is reached or convergence  ( according to some predefined threshold @xmath121 ) is achieved .",
    "an alternative explanation of algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] based on the majorization - minimization approach is given in  @xcite .",
    "it makes use of the following property of the @xmath89 norm  @xcite : @xmath122 for @xmath123 , where @xmath124 the majorization - minimization method can be regarded as solving a sequence of minimization problems , where in each instance it minimizes a surrogate function that locally majorizes the true objective function ( see  @xcite for more details ) . for a concave and differentiable function @xmath125 ,",
    "a simple and effective majorization - minimization update is : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the feasible set of the problem . since for every @xmath128 , @xmath129 is concave on @xmath130 , substituting   and   into",
    ", we obtain : @xmath131 where @xmath127 is the feasible set of  [ eq : opt3 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that   is exactly what algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] computes in each iteration .",
    "hence algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] can be viewed as using the majorization - minimization method to minimize the approximate objective : @xmath132 .",
    "the concavity of @xmath133 and   imply @xmath134 , which establishes the convergence of algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] .      algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] mainly deals with the combinatorial nature of  [ eq : opt ] introduced by the binary variables @xmath46",
    ". however , the number of variables in  [ eq : opt3 ] is @xmath135 due to the @xmath10 frequency patterns .",
    "we next reduce the complexity and improve the convergence speed somewhat using the fact that switching each bts off halves the number of available patterns .",
    "there are two important properties of  [ eq : opt3 ] and algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] .",
    "first , if @xmath84 , according to   and  , then @xmath69 for every @xmath8 that contains @xmath26 .",
    "second , if @xmath112 is close to 0 , once algorithm 1 decides to switch a certain bts off in some iteration , it is unlikely to be reactivated in later iterations .",
    "this is because the weight @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath84 is typically much larger than that corresponding to any other nonzero element .",
    "based on these two properties , a refined version of algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] is proposed in algorithm  [ alg : refine ] , which reduces the dimensions of the feasible set during the iterations .",
    "compute @xmath103 and the corresponding optimum @xmath104 by solving  [ eq : opt3 ] with @xmath105 as the weights .",
    "update the weights by @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath138 @xmath139 3 .",
    "@xmath107 .",
    "the only change from algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] is that the btss turned off at the end of each iteration are eliminated from future optimizations if a certain condition is met .",
    "namely , if some @xmath51 becomes zero in any iteration , we then compare the sum of the penalties on all nonzero components , @xmath140 against the penalty on any zero component up to a scale factor , namely , @xmath141 . if the total penalty on the nonzero terms is smaller , the pico btss with zero @xmath51 will be ignored in future iterations , i.e. , future optimizations of  [ eq : opt3 ] will be considered for the reduced pico bts set @xmath142 .",
    "analogous to algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] , algorithm  [ alg : refine ] can be regarded as updating a sequence of objective functions @xmath143 in the same form , but with @xmath144 updated in each iteration . with slight abuse of notation ,",
    "corresponds to the ( possibly reduced ) set @xmath144 . here",
    "@xmath145 is evaluated by setting any @xmath146 not in the original @xmath144 to zero .",
    "] we have @xmath147 .",
    "it is also easy to show that @xmath148 .",
    "hence the values of the approximate objective @xmath149 after each iteration form a monotonically decreasing sequence , which establishes the convergence of algorithm  [ alg : refine ] .    to avoid a premature reduction of the feasible set , the weights on active and inactive btss",
    "are compared in algorithm  [ alg : refine ] .",
    "when @xmath150 , it is easy to see that an off bts in the current iteration will not be turned back on in the next iteration according to algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] .",
    "this is because the total reduction of the objective achieved by turning off all currently active btss in the next iteration is not enough to compensate for the increased cost due to reactivating a single currently inactive bts . by setting the scale factor @xmath151 small enough , the off btss that are eliminated from the feasible set",
    "are unlikely ( albeit still possible ) to be turned on again according to algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] .",
    "if @xmath152 pico btss are removed from @xmath144 , the number of variables is reduced by a factor of @xmath153 , which results in a @xmath153 complexity reduction in future iterations .",
    "the performance of algorithms  [ alg : l1 ] and  [ alg : refine ] will be compared in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "algorithms  [ alg : l1 ] and  [ alg : refine ] can be used to solve  [ eq : opt3 ] if the function @xmath125 in   is convex .",
    "the only difference then is that the continuous optimization problem in each iteration is a convex optimization problem instead of a linear program .      the post processing in  @xcite rounds up the continuous relaxation of user associations to binary associations",
    "this is not an issue in the model considered here since user association over a slow timescale is indirectly determined by the amount of resources allocated to each group .",
    "however , a different post processing can be used to improve the delay performance without increasing the energy cost , since the objective   only depends on the binary variables @xmath46 . here",
    "post processing is executed after a solution of  [ eq : opt ] is obtained .",
    "the process is performed over the subset of active btss , with all off btss removed from the formulation . specifically , the post processing is to solve the following problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    p5 [ eq : opt4 ] @xmath154    where objective   is the average packet sojourn time in the network .",
    "[ eq : opt4 ] is a convex program and is much easier to solve than  [ eq : opt ] .",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : sim ] that post processing can greatly improve the delay performance in the light traffic regime .",
    "the post processing is helpful if the objective only depends on the @xmath89 norm .",
    "we can also consider the generalizations in section  [ subsec : gen ] to minimize the total combined cost of energy and delay .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples .",
    "in particular , we compare the performance of algorithms  [ alg : l1 ] and  [ alg : refine ] for solving  [ eq : opt ] as well as the performance of algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] for solving  [ eq : opt2 ] , which basically corresponds to the scheme of  @xcite .",

    "both algorithms converge within two iterations .",
    "in fact , both algorithms immediately realize that all pico btss should be turned off under such light loads .",
    "hence the reduction of the feasible set in algorithm  [ alg : refine ] never happens . in the moderate and heavy traffic regimes ,",
    "algorithm  [ alg : refine ] takes fewer iterations due to the feasible set reduction .",
    "the runtime using algorithm  [ alg : refine ] is reduced by as much as 42 times compared to algorithm  [ alg : l1 ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] .",
    "the shorter runtime is due to both faster convergence and lower computational complexity in each iteration with reduced dimensions .",
    "a central controller needs to know the traffic intensity of all ue groups and the spectral efficiency of all links ( i.e. , @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) in order to perform the proposed energy - efficient global resource management .",

    "the proposed algorithms can efficiently optimize a network cluster with up to 20 btss .",
    "the improved performance is at the cost of increased computational complexity for exploiting spectrum agility .",
    "the main drawback of the current problem formulation is that the complexity scales exponentially with network size due to the combinatorial patterns . in practice , many of the @xmath10 patterns in a large hetnet can be easily ruled out , i.e. , two btss far apart will not interfere with each other , and a ue will not be served by a bts far away . extending this approach to much larger hetnets is ongoing work .",

    "<S> next generation ( 5 g ) cellular networks are expected to be supported by an extensive infrastructure with many - fold increase in the number of cells per unit area compared to today . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy consumption of base transceiver stations ( btss ) is an important issue for both economic and environmental reasons . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> an optimization - based framework is proposed for energy - efficient global radio resource management in heterogeneous wireless networks . specifically , with stochastic arrivals of known rates intended for users , the smallest set of btss is activated with jointly optimized user association and spectrum allocation to stabilize the network first and then minimize the delay . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme can be carried out periodically on a relatively slow timescale to adapt to aggregate traffic variations and average channel conditions . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the energy consumption and increases the quality of service compared to existing schemes in the literature . </S>"
