    "tunneling is , like interference , a characteristic property of waves .",
    "this effect occurs both in non - relativistic quantum mechanics and in electrodynamics . although the time dependent differential equations of both theories are fundamentally different in their structure , theoretical calculations yield analogous results for the traversal time of the maximum of a wave packet s modulus .",
    "these calculations are based on the stationary phase approximation @xcite as well as on a scattering ansatz @xcite . for sufficiently long barriers ,",
    "the time delay is independent of the thickness and , thus , can correspond to arbitrary large effective velocities of the maximum of a pulse for crossing the barrier .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with results obtained by nimtz and enders in tunneling experiments with evanescent microwaves in a waveguide with a frequency below cut - off @xcite . in these experiments the evanescent waveguide region , i.e.  the barrier ,",
    "is realized by an undersized region in between normal sized regions of a waveguide line . due to the inhomogeneous cross section of the waveguide",
    ", we could nt obtain an analytic expression for the transmission coefficient .",
    "therefore , a recent microwave experiment @xcite studied a barrier produced by a low - dielectric - constant ( @xmath0 ) region which was placed in a rectangular waveguide of the same cross section , filled with a higher dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "this experimental set - up is illustrated in fig .",
    "the relation between wave number @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 is given by the dispersion formula ( with the vacuum speed of light set to @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the cut - off frequency of the empty waveguide and @xmath7 is the variable dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "therefore a wave of frequency @xmath8 with @xmath9 possesses a real wave number @xmath2 outside the barrier , but on entering the tunnel region with a lower dielectric constant @xmath2 becomes imaginary , and the wave will spatially decay .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the electrodynamic tunneling for a barrier given by a variable dielectric constant .",
    "this set - up is amenable to a rigorous mathematical description .",
    "it was theoretically investigated first by martin and landauer @xcite .",
    "they concentrated on the tunneling of a gaussian pulse with a narrow frequency range . using a scattering ansatz they showed that the time delay of the center of mass depends only on the frequency derivative of the phase of the transmission coefficient . for sufficiently long barriers ,",
    "this delay becomes independent of thickness and thus corresponds to an arbitrary large effective velocity of the center of mass for crossing the tunnel region , which is known as the hartman effect @xcite and has been experimentally verified first by enders and nimtz @xcite .",
    "= 1.0    we want to examine how this effect is related to causality . to carry out this goal ,",
    "the fundamental solution of the given set - up , the retarded green s function , will be constructed analytically assuming causality .",
    "this means that this function vanishes outside the past light cone , i.e. the wave front travels with the vacuum speed of light . with the aid of this solution we will give an analytic expression for the entire transmitted pulse , which has the observed superluminal property of the center of mass .",
    "in addition this allows us to determine the deformation of the pulse caused by crossing the barrier .",
    "it is assumed that the initial pulse is given by a truncated gaussian wave packet located only to the left of the barrier .",
    "the green s function will be obtained using a laplace transform .",
    "the structure of the dipersion formula ( [ dispform ] ) prevents an analytic inversion of this transformation because of the different coefficients in front of @xmath10 outside and inside the barrier , respectively .",
    "therefore we consider in this paper a simplified model for the electromagnetic tunneling effect with dispersion formulas given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 coefficients dropped and cut - off frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 outside and inside the barrier , respectively .",
    "the transmission coefficient of the barrier does not change qualitatively under this simplification .",
    "the model given by these dispersion formulas , together with the maxwell equations , still represents an electrodynamic case of tunneling . within this model the velocity of a wave front @xmath15 is always given by the vacuum speed of light and it is assumed that the dielectric medium influences only the cut - off frequencies themselves .",
    "a similar model consisting of a classical scalar field which satisfies the one - dimensional relativistic klein - gordon equation with a rectangular potential barrier was investigated by deutch and low @xcite . under the condition that the tunneling amplitude is very small",
    ", they found an approximate solution given by a gaussian wave packet , which turns up on the right hand side of the barrier as if its maximum took zero time to cross the barrier .",
    "our goal here is to find an exact solution of the maxwell equations yielding exact values for the tunneling time of the maximum of a gaussian wave packet , which can be compared to the approximate results given by martin and landauer .",
    "furthermore , taking truncated wave packets of variable variance , the influence of these attributes on the tunneling time will be studied .",
    "suppose that an electromagnetic pulse has been generated in the region to the left of the barrier by an appropriate current which has vanished already before the wave front of the pulse reaches the left end of the barrier .",
    "the propagation of this pulse is then determined by the dispersion formulas together with the maxwell equations with vanishing charge current .",
    "one can obtain the propagated field behind the barrier by solving these equations with the pulse located in front of the barrier as initial condition .",
    "this can be done with the aid of the retarded green s function . in the case of the electromagnetic field , this fundamental solution can be written as an antisymmetric tensor @xmath16 , @xmath17 , satisfying the four dimensional wave equation with the dirac distribution at the fixed space - time position @xmath18 as inhomogeneity @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the laplace - beltrami - operator of the minkowskian space time @xcite . beyond that , @xmath21 must allow for the following boundary conditions : first , it has to vanish outside the past light cone at @xmath18 , second its six components have to jump in the respective correct manner at the two boundaries between the propagating and the evanescent region and must take into account the metallic boundary conditions on the surface of the waveguide . in the next section , we will give a solution of this boundary value problem where the axial magnetic component @xmath22 of green s function shall serve as example .",
    "given the relevant field components in front of the barrier at the time @xmath23 , the expression @xmath24",
    "dx^1 dx^2 dx^3\\ ] ] yields the time evolution of the @xmath25 component of the magnetic field behind the barrier @xmath26 in terms of partial derivatives @xmath27 of green s function .",
    "the three - dimensional domain @xmath28 of integration is the interior of the whole waveguide line at time @xmath23 .",
    "we solve the time dependent wave equation ( [ waveeq ] ) by a laplace transform relative to the time @xmath29 for a fixed @xmath18 with the property @xmath30 .",
    "the laplace transform yields , after inversion , a function in the time domain which vanishes _ until _ a certain time is reached .",
    "therefore this method is only suitable to get the advanced green s function .",
    "the retarded green s function , though , can then be obtained by a simple time reflection .",
    "the transformed components of green s function are defined by @xmath31=\\int_0^{\\infty}e^{i\\omega    x^0}g_{\\bar{x}}{}_{\\alpha\\beta}dx^0\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes the laplace transform with @xmath3 in the upper half plane of complex numbers .    for a waveguide with perfectly conducting walls given by the surface @xmath33 , the boundary condition for the electromagnetic field reads @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vector normal to the surface @xmath33 .",
    "this condition is satisfied if one uses a green s function which is invariant relative to the reflections at the four walls of the rectangular waveguide .",
    "this invariant green s function can be decomposed into the characteristic modes of the waveguide .",
    "the result for the laplace transformed components can be written as @xmath36 introducing the antisymmetric tensor @xmath37 with @xmath38 this tensor describes the @xmath39- and @xmath40-dependence of the modes represented by its respective pairs of numbers @xmath41 .",
    "here we have introduced a one dimensional green s function @xmath42 to account for the dependence on the axial coordinate @xmath43 .",
    "only this function contains the dependence on the frequency and will therefore define the time evolution of the field . applying the transformed wave equation ( [ waveeq ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) , we find that the one dimensional green s function has to be a solution of the ordinary differential equation given by @xmath44 \\tilde{g}_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\bar{x}^3,x^3)=\\delta(x^3-\\bar{x}^3 ) \\label{1dgreen}\\ ] ] with the jumping cut - off frequency determined by the simplified dispersion formulas ( [ simpdisp ] ) , i.e. @xmath45 with @xmath46 for a rectangular waveguide .",
    "notice that the cut - off frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath48 change with the type of mode .",
    "thus the one dimensional green s function also depends on the numbers @xmath41 . in eq .",
    "( [ 1dgreen ] ) no boundary terms at zero time emerge from the laplace transform of the second time derivative due to the vanishing of the advanced green s function for @xmath49 and the property @xmath30 .    the one dimensional green s function for ( [ 1dgreen ] ) can be constructed from two linear independent solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation .",
    "these can be chosen as a plane wave traveling from the left - hand side and the right - hand side , respectively , toward the barrier , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the total antisymmetric tensor @xmath52 .",
    "the wave numbers @xmath2 and @xmath53 are given by the dispersion formulas ( [ simpdisp ] ) .",
    "due to the upper half plane analyticity of a laplace transformed function , the square roots in these equations have to be chosen analytic in the upper @xmath3 half plane .",
    "hence the wave numbers always have a positive imaginary part . the respective coefficients",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are uniquely determined by the boundary conditions at the two planes defining the evanescent region between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the coefficients of both solutions are assumed to be equal because of the symmetry of the barrier relative to @xmath60 .",
    "taking into account that the imaginary part of @xmath2 is positive , the asymptotic behavior of the two solutions looks like @xmath61 therefore we can construct green s function in the upper @xmath3 half plane as @xmath62 with the wronskian @xmath63 of @xmath64 and @xmath65 defined by @xmath66    the case @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath26 is the interesting one for the investigation of the tunneling time problem for wave packets . in this case",
    "green s function is suitable to calculate the field behind the barrier for a pulse assumed to be located initially only in the front of the barrier . in this case",
    "the green s function reads @xmath69    we now must consider the respective matching conditions for the components of the electromagnetic field to evaluate the coefficients of the two solutions",
    ". for simplicity let us only look at the calculations for the component @xmath25 .",
    "this component has to be continuous at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore we need the behavior of its partial derivative perpendicular to the boundary - planes of the barrier . the transverse components @xmath70 and @xmath71 are continuous at any position of the two boundary - planes .",
    "hence its partial derivatives parallel to the boundary - planes , i.e. the @xmath39- and @xmath40-derivatives , also have to be continuous at these planes .",
    "the equation div@xmath72 shows that the @xmath43-derivative of the component @xmath25 is continuous at the boundary - planes , too .",
    "these four continuity conditions together yield the coefficients of the corresponding functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 with the common denominator @xmath76 due to the absence of upper half plane zeros of @xmath77 the coefficients are analytic in this half plane .",
    "we find the one dimensional retarded green s function in the time domain after a time reflection . the inverse laplace transform yields , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 with @xmath42 given by eq.([green - icase ] ) .",
    "in the case of the component @xmath25 we now have to consider the transmission coefficient @xmath80 given in ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "note that the expression @xmath81 never vanishes in the upper @xmath3 half plane .",
    "thus , expanding the right - hand side of ( [ tc ] ) with @xmath82 , we find @xmath83 the term @xmath84 is bounded in the upper @xmath3 half plane by @xmath85 and the imaginary part of @xmath53 is always positive in this half plane .",
    "thus the transmission coefficient can be written as a geometric series @xmath86    at this stage we need the simplified dispersion formulas ( [ simpdisp ] ) for an analytic inversion of the laplace transform .",
    "expanding each term of the series with @xmath87 cancels the @xmath10 terms in the numerator .",
    "thus the transformed green s function ( [ green - icase ] ) becomes @xmath88 for our further calculations it is useful to write this as @xmath89 with the new function @xmath90 given by @xmath91 and an effective cut - off frequency @xmath92 . disregarding the factor ahead of the fraction in ( [ fdef ] ) for a moment",

    "even the leading term @xmath111 of the series , and thus @xmath112 , jumps from zero to a finite value at the boundary of the past light cone .",
    "this property of green s function guarantees the causal propagation of every pulse . in opposition to the free space here",
    "the support of green s function is not only the boundary of the light cone but its full interior .",
    "there are two reasons for this feature .",
    "first , consider the first term in eq .",
    "( [ helpf2 ] ) and accordingly the terms of the series @xmath113 given by eq .",
    "( [ helpf1 ] ) .",
    "these terms contribute to the series only when @xmath114 .",
    "thus the @xmath95th term of the series represents the part of the field that leaves the barrier on the right hand side after @xmath115 reflections at its boundaries . for",
    "the second reason take a look at the second term of eq .",
    "( [ helpf2 ] ) .",
    "this term has nothing to do with the barrier itself but arises from the boundary conditions of the wave guide .",
    "notice that the field is reflected there and back from the metallic boundaries while propagating through the waveguide .",
    "this echo effect is described by the integral of the term in question .",
    "this integral represents a distortion in which all excitations that are noticeable at a given position in the time interval @xmath116 $ ] take part .",
    "now we will solve the maxwell equations for a given pulse using green s function determined in the last section . before starting with this calculation we want to simplify green s function .",
    "it has been noticed above that a distortion integral like that of eq .",
    "( [ helpf2 ] ) always arises in the case of guided waves .",
    "however , the tunneling effect itself is described completely by the functions @xmath117 in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ helpf2 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the undistorted delay induced by the tunneling effect only .",
    "therefore , in the following calculations we consider only this term of green s function , i.e. we set @xmath118 to determine the influence of the barrier itself on the transmitted pulse . with this simplification , the studied system has been mapped onto the model investigated by deutch and low @xcite .",
    "their cut off frequency corresponds to our effective cut - off frequency @xmath92 .",
    "notice that , for comparing with experimental results , the contribution of the distortion term to the total transmitted pulse decreases with an increasing difference between the lower cut - off frequency @xmath47 and the central frequency @xmath8 of the pulse .",
    "using now eq .",
    "( [ b3int ] ) , ( [ ansatz1 ] ) with the simplified form ( [ simpgreen ] ) of green s function with @xmath23 , we obtain the component @xmath25 behind the barrier for an arbitrary pulse started in front of the tunneling region .",
    "our calculations will be carried out with a pulse given by a truncated gaussian @xmath119-mode centered at some position @xmath120 in front of the barrier and with central frequency @xmath8 corresponding to the wavenumber @xmath121 . in this case",
    "the relevant and non vanishing field components @xcite are the real parts of @xmath122 with the gaussian envelope @xmath123 the distance between the maximum and the wavefront of the packet is given by the parameter @xmath124 with the property @xmath125 .",
    "the upper boundary of @xmath124 comes from the condition that the wavefront of the initial pulse has to be in front of the barrier at @xmath23 .",
    "this is necessary because the barrier causes deformations of the pulse which are initially unknown .    with this initial pulse one",
    "can carry out the integration in eq .",
    "( [ b3int ] ) using the convolution theorem . changing the integration variable to @xmath126",

    "so we have to do only a finite number of numerical integrations to obtain the component @xmath25 . the envelope of @xmath25 is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] for different barrier thicknesses @xmath134 and fixed central and cut - off frequencies .",
    "the distance @xmath124 between the maximum and the wave front of the wave packet has to be large enough to prevent deformations of the transmitted pulse that arise in the case of a pulse with too large high - frequency components . for this and",
    "the following results @xmath124 has been chosen to be five times the initial variance @xmath135 of the pulse .",
    "due to the trivial dependence of the solution on the coordinate @xmath39 we have always set @xmath136 corresponding to the boundary of the waveguide .",
    "because we have eliminated the echo effect caused by the waveguide itself , the pulse does not change its shape outside the barrier region .",
    "thus the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] correspond to the time evolution of the wave packet measured by an observer at an arbitrary position behind the barrier . to determine the tunneling time of the maximum of the wave packet",
    ", we can use the free propagation of the wave packet outside the barrier , i.e.  the fact that it travels there with the vacuum speed of light without changing its shape .",
    "then the maximum of the packet arrives at the left end of the barrier at @xmath137 .",
    "now let @xmath138 be the value of @xmath131 at which the envelope of @xmath139 has its maximum .",
    "considering the definition of the coordinate @xmath131 , one obtains for the arrival time at the right end of the barrier @xmath140 . thus the tunneling time is given by @xmath138 .",

    "this result agrees with the experimental observation that for sufficiently long barriers the tunneling time is independent of thickness @xcite .",
    "the variance of the transmitted wave packets decreases with increasing barrier thickness .    to determine the dependence of the tunneling time on the central frequency of the initial pulses we have calculated the corresponding transmitted wave packets for a barrier of fixed thickness @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we have considered gaussians with variances both above ( @xmath146 ) and below ( @xmath147 ) the thickness .",

    "but this situation is not possible because the tangential vectors of the curves have to point in the directions of the future light cone .",

    "the closer two neighboring points of the initial pulse at @xmath23 are to the starting point @xmath160 of the bifurcation curve , the more the distance between them is extended by this mapping .",

    "the surprising result of our solutions is the almost exact reconstruction of a gaussian wave packet behind the barrier .",
    "this effect yields a pulse - reshaping @xcite .    to obtain a more physical point of view",
    "one can ask at which time the transmitted pulse exceeds an arbitrary threshold behind the barrier .",
    "due to the damping and squeezing of the transmitted pulse this happens always at a later time compared to a pulse which crosses no barrier .",
    "that means for an observer behind the barrier that he would not detect the tunneled pulse earlier than the freely propagated one , in agreement with causality .",
    "in eq .  ( [ finsol ] ) , we have given an exact analytic expression in the time domain for the causal green s function of a model that describes an ideal case of electromagnetic tunneling .",
    "the structure of this function allows for a reduction to those terms which describe only the pure tunneling effect without the distortions caused by the waveguide . with this reduced green s function",
    ", we calculated the shape of transmitted wave packets for truncated gaussians as initial pulses .",
    "the resulting pulse can be also gaussian - like . in agreement with the approximate result of martin and landauer @xcite and the experiments on microwaves by enders and nimtz @xcite ,",
    "the time delay of the maximum of the pulse becomes nearly independent of the thickness for sufficiently long barriers .",
    "furthermore , the variance of the transmitted packet decreases with increasing barrier thickness . by examining the properties of the energy flow",
    ", we have found consistency of a superluminal pulse maximum with the causality of maxwell s theory .    within this interpretation the energy of the transmitted pulse",
    "can only originate from a connected part behind the wave front of the initial wave packet because the integral curves of the energy flow do not intersect each other . in this sense , the gaussian shape of the transmitted pulse",
    "can only be interpreted as an amazing interference effect . due to the propagation of the wave front with the vacuum speed of light ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain a superluminal maximum if the barrier thickness exceeds the distance between the maximum and the wave front .",
    "thus , in the case of truncated wave packets , the time delay of the maximum does not stay independent of the thickness for all barrier length . in summary",
    ", the results of the tunneling experiments can be obtained from the causal maxwell theory .",
