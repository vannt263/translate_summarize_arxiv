    "the number of the soft partons grows with increasing energy due to quantum branching , which eventually leads to merging and saturation of the partons in the projectile at a certain energy characterized by the scale @xmath0 .",
    "such soft ( wee ) partons are relevant not only in the diffractive process in deep inelastic scatterings but also for thermalization in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the dense transient system at mid - rapidity is initially created through the interactions between the soft partons from the incident nuclei .    in the au - au collisions at the top energy @xmath1 of relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    ", the relevant scale of bjorken s @xmath2 is roughly estimated as @xmath3 with presuming that the bulk of the initial medium is composed of the gluons of momenta @xmath4 .",
    "then , the phenomenological golec - biernat  wsthoff fit  @xcite , multiplied by a nuclear enhancement factor @xmath5 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) gives rise to @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the bunch of the incoming gluons with @xmath7 in the incident nuclei are in the saturation regime .",
    "these gluons are to be described as the classical weizscker - williams fields  @xcite in the first approximation .",
    "such a classical field picture is expected to be more reliable at the energy of large hadron collider ( lhc ) , @xmath8 . at this energy",
    "the saturation scale for the pb - pb collisions will be around @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 times larger than that of rhic .  since it will be shown that the energy density and multiplicity will scale with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ,",
    "the former will become @xmath13 times larger and the latter @xmath14 times larger at lhc than at rhic .  at the same time",
    ", the typical time scale at lhc will be @xmath15 times shorter than at rhic  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will address the initial stage of the nuclear collisions at rhic energy taking the saturation scale as @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "[ this uncertainty comes from the choice of relevant @xmath2 . ]",
    "there are a number of efforts to solve the classical yang - mills equations of motion in order to determine the early - time evolution in the heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies have been performed quite successfully so far  @xcite and also the analytical techniques are developing recently  @xcite based on the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model  @xcite in the cgc picture .",
    "this paper is a continued attempt from ref .",
    "@xcite to give an analytical estimate for the energy deposit and the gluon production from the colliding coherent fields .",
    "it is well known that the initial gauge configuration contains only the longitudinal fields  @xcite .",
    "these longitudinal fields rapidly decay and the nonzero transverse fields are generated in the early - time evolution . however , if we expand the evolution of the energy density in a power series of @xmath18 from the collision time @xmath19 , we find that an ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence in each term , especially in the zeroth order term , i.e.  initial energy density .",
    "this divergence originates from the perturbative tail of the gluon distribution in the mv model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an ansatz of the logarithmic form was proposed by one of the authors to resum this uv singularity . here",
    "we take another way . because the origin of the divergence is in the uv regime where couplings between the classical fields are unimportant",
    ", one should be able to tame the divergent terms within the perturbative framework .",
    "this is indeed the case , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite in a different context and emphasized also in the numerical simulation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall resum all the most uv - singular terms , which results in solving the free - field equation .",
    "the solution is the bessel function in the boost - invariant expanding geometry . at finite proper time @xmath18",
    "we can send the uv cutoff to infinity .",
    "moreover we find that the energy density behaves as @xmath20 at large @xmath18 , consistently with the free - streaming behavior .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath21 reproduces the original uv divergence of the energy density as it should .",
    "our present approach consists of the exact initial condition of the mv model and the following perturbative time evolution .",
    "the saturation effect is fully taken into account in the initial condition in this sense .",
    "we first neglect any nonlinear effect in the time dependence , and therefore the validity of this first treatment is limited to the very early time when the uv modes dominate the dynamics .",
    "this approach recovers the same analytical result as ref .",
    "@xcite in a simple manner .",
    "although the free - streaming region is no longer in the reliable range of the approximation , it is worth estimating the energy and the gluon multiplicity there and comparing them with the empirical values .",
    "next we will examine the size of the nonlinear effect in the time evolution by including a mean - field type resummation in the equation .",
    "our analyses should be useful to grasp deeper understanding of the qualitative feature inherent to the glasma  @xcite , a transient stage from the coherent cgc state decaying to the thermalized plasma state . from our study",
    "two remarks are here in order .",
    "1 ) although the initial energy at the collision point in the mv model contains the uv divergence  @xcite , the momentum spectrum of the energy content and the gluon distribution is well - defined as we will explicitly compute .",
    "the spectrum is quite informative on its own .",
    "2 ) another potential application is the analytical approach toward the glasma instability  @xcite found in the numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "because the instability presumably resides in the very early time where our description of the time evolution works , it is a feasible strategy to examine the stability of field fluctuations on top of the perturbative time evolution .",
    "we will list more future outlooks in the final section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the mv model .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaussian ] , we calculate the correlation functions of the gluon fields and fix the mv model parameter corresponding to @xmath0 for a given infrared regulator . section  [ sec : steps ] is devoted to a guide for our calculation procedures which are divided into the following four sections ; the proper time expansion is discussed in sec .
