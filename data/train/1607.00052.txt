    "note also every hyperplane in @xmath161 crosses every hyperplane in @xmath216 , so that they determine a flat @xmath269 .",
    "moreover since @xmath4 is parallel to one of the hyperplanes in @xmath161 , it is parallel or peripheral to all hyperplanes in @xmath161 .",

    "since the hyperplanes in @xmath216 all intersect the hyperplanes in @xmath159 , we have that @xmath161 has crossing hyperplanes .",
    "it follows that the parallel set @xmath275 for @xmath3 is of the form @xmath276 .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath4 stabilizes @xmath253 , so that @xmath251 stabilizes @xmath253 .        1 .",

    "for any other @xmath283 , we have that the pairs @xmath288 and @xmath289 is of type i or ii . it can not be that both pairs are of type i since @xmath290 .",
    "also , it can not be that @xmath283 is subparallel to both @xmath281 and @xmath280 , for otherwise @xmath291 would be parallel to hyperplanes in @xmath292 and in @xmath293 , but every hyperplane in @xmath292 crosses every hyperplane in @xmath293 in a single point .",
    "thus a line can not be parallel to a hyperplane in @xmath292 and a hyperplane in @xmath293 .",
    "it follows that , without loss of generality , @xmath283 is subparallel to @xmath281 and @xmath294 .",

    "finally , suppose that all the pairs @xmath295 are of type i. thus @xmath296 for all @xmath297 .",
    "thus @xmath6 stabilizes @xmath298 .",
    "if @xmath253 contains squares , then @xmath100 is trivial and @xmath283 stabilizes @xmath253 as required .",

    "<S> in this paper we start the inquiry into proving uniform exponential growth in the context of groups acting on cat(0)cube complexes . we address free group actions on cat(0)square complexes and prove the more general statement that if @xmath0 is a finite collection of hyperbolic automorphisms of a cat(0)square complex @xmath1 , then either there exists a pair of elements in @xmath2 and a pair words of length at most 7 in @xmath3 and @xmath4 which freely generate a free semigroup , or there exists a flat ( of dimension 1 or 2 ) in @xmath1 stabilized by all elements of @xmath0 . as a corollary , we obtain a lower bound for the growth constant , @xmath5{2}$ ] , which is uniform not just for a given group acting freely on a given cat(0)cube complex , but for all non virtually abelian groups acting freely on any cat(0)square complex . </S>"
