    "here , we present new vla h  i  imaging of the starburst galaxies tol1924@xmath1416and iras08339 + 6517   [ @xmath0,@xmath2 ( j2000 ) @xmath3 08:38:23.2 , 65:07:15 ; d @xmath4 80 mpc ( assuming h@xmath5 = 72 kmsec@xmath6mpc@xmath6 ; freedman etal .   2001 ) ] .",
    "both galaxies reveal extended tidal structure in neutral hydrogen and are clearly interacting with nearby companions .",
    "each appears to provide evidence for tidally - induced starburst episodes .",
    "these two systems were chosen for imaging because they exhibit prominent ly@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "hydrogen ly@xmath0  is one of the most important diagnostic emission lines in astrophysics .",
    "it is predicted to be luminous in star - forming galaxies @xcite , and could potentially be used as an indicator of star formation activity in high - redshift systems .",
    "however , this application is not straightforward , since the propagation of ly@xmath0  photons in starburst galaxies appears to be a complex process that depends on many factors intrinsic to both the starburst itself ( e.g. , star formation rate , metallicity ) and to the surrounding galaxy ( e.g. , geometry , kinematics , and dust content ) .    in a large spectroscopic sample of comparatively high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; these systems have typical star formation rates @xmath7 10 m@xmath8yr@xmath6 and are thus directly comparable to more local `` starburst '' galaxies ) , @xcite find various correlations between the emergent ly@xmath0  profile ( i.e. , strengths of absorption or emission ) and characteristics of the ism . in particular , dustier galaxies have less prominent ly@xmath0   emission , or equivalently , redder uv continuum slopes",
    ". ly@xmath0  emission strength is shown to anti - correlate with the kinematic offset implied by the redshift difference between ly@xmath0  emission and low - ionization interstellar absorption lines ; that is , systems with larger outflow speeds usually show less prominent ly@xmath0  emission . finally",
    ", systems with stronger ly@xmath0  emission show lower star formation rates , on average , than systems with weaker ly@xmath0emission .",
    "these correlations suggest that many factors can contribute to the escape fraction of ly@xmath0  from starburst regions .",
    "one of the most important factors that influences ly@xmath0  propagation is resonant scattering . it is well known that due to high resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen in the ism , ly@xmath0  photons can be attenuated by even small amounts of dust .",
    "it is then expected that only young , relatively dust - free galaxies should be prodigious sites of ly@xmath0  production .",
    "low - metallicity starburst galaxies in the local universe may be considered nearby analogs to such objects which are expected in greater numbers at higher redshifts .",
    "thus it was surprising that hst observations of the most metal - poor galaxy known , izw18 , showed only damped ly@xmath0  absorption and no emission @xcite .",
    "in stark contrast , the more metal - rich starburst galaxy haro2 showed prominent ly@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "the effects of resonant scattering can be lessened if there is a velocity difference between the site of ly@xmath0  emission and the surrounding material from which resonant scattering can occur .",
    "this will doppler shift the ly@xmath0   photon out of resonance and increase its chance of escaping the surrounding ism . while this process seems to be complicated ( note , for example , that higher outflow speeds suggest less prominent ly@xmath0  emission profiles in the sample of shapley etal .",
    "2003 ) , it appears that an important factor is the presence or absence of an outflow ( see below ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite measure an average ly@xmath0  offset @xmath9 300kms@xmath6  for the sample of ly@xmath0-emitting lbgs . these observations and the studies of giavalisco etal .",
    "( 1996 ) and @xcite argue for the importance of ism geometry and kinematics in affecting the ly@xmath0  escape fraction .",
    "the studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have examined the characteristics of the ism kinematics which appear to influence the propagation of ly@xmath0  photons in star - forming galaxies .",
    "if static , homogeneous neutral gas with column densities @xmath7 10@xmath10@xmath11 shields the ionized gas , no emission will be detected .",
    "the resonant scattering of the ly@xmath0  photons will lead to increased probability of destruction by any dust which is present . on the other hand",
    ", there may be diffuse ly@xmath0  emission which is detectable on sightlines not coincident with the sources of uv photons .",
    "similarly , if the areal coverage of the neutral gas is not uniform but clumpy , some ly@xmath0  emission may be detectable on favorable sightlines . finally ,",
    "if the velocity structure of the neutral gas is not static but rather outflowing from the ionizing regions ( outflow velocities 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex200kms@xmath6 ) , ly@xmath0  photons to the red of 1216can escape and ly@xmath0  emission may be significant .",
    "this explains the strong ly@xmath0  emission detected in some starburst galaxies with complete spatial coverage by neutral gas which is also comparatively rich in both metals and dust .",
    "these observations were undertaken with these arguments in mind .",
    "our group has obtained new hst / acs imaging of the ly@xmath0  line in a small sample of galaxies ( see kunth etal .  2003 ) , two of which are tol1924@xmath1416  and iras08339 + 6517 .",
    "while these data are only a small segment of the sample that was imaged in ly@xmath0 , they will aide in the interpretation of the ly@xmath0  data .",
    "we note that our h  i  imaging sample does not include systems showing only ly@xmath0   absorption , so we must await a larger sample to draw definitive conclusions on the correlation between h  i  kinematics and the appearance of ly@xmath0  emission . however , the results presented here support the scenario that the geometry and kinematics of the ism are important ( although not the only ) factors that affect the escape probability of ly@xmath0  photons from massive star formation regions .",
    "the nrao very large array ( vla ) was used to obtain h  i   spectral line data for these two systems , as part of observing program ac654 .",
    "tol1924@xmath1416  was observed in the bnc configuration for 180 minutes on 2002 september 30 , while iras08339 + 6517  was observed in the c configuration for 370 minutes on 2002 december 8 &  9 .",
    "the correlator configuration yields a bandwidth of 3.125 mhz , with 64 channels separated by 48.8 khz ( 10.5 kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated using standard methods in the aips environment .",
    "the data were imaged using uniform weighting ; the single - plane rms noise is 1.3 mjybeam@xmath6  for tol1924@xmath1416  and 0.40 mjybeam@xmath6  for iras08339 + 6517 . with the final beam sizes ( 26@xmath1216  for tol1924@xmath1416 , and 21@xmath1216  for iras08339 + 6517 ) , this noise level implies single - plane 3@xmath13 detection thresholds of 2.3@xmath1210@xmath14 @xmath11 and 6.9@xmath1210@xmath15 @xmath11 for tol1924@xmath1416and iras08339 + 6517 , respectively .",
    "with these data we detect extended tidal structure in each of these systems . in both cases",
    "h  i  gas is detected in the target system , in a neighboring galaxy , and in tidal material .      in figure  [ figcap1 ] we present contours of the zeroth - moment ( total column density ) image overlaid on a dss optical image of tol1924@xmath1416 , as well as an intensity - weighted velocity field .",
    "we detect a total integrated flux of 12.6@xmath161.58jykms@xmath6  from the tol1924@xmath1416  system .",
    "this compares well with the single - dish value of 11.4jykms@xmath6  derived from parkes observations in the hipass survey @xcite , suggesting that we have missed little or no flux due to the lack of zero - spacing interferometric elements . at the adopted distance of 37.5 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a total h  i  mass of ( 4.2@xmath160.5)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8 .",
    "inspecting the h  i  data cube allows us to measure the masses of neutral gas clearly associated with both tol1924@xmath1416  and with the companion eso338@xmath1ig04b . in the former",
    "we detect a total mass of ( 1.4@xmath160.2)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8 , and in the latter we find ( 9.3@xmath161.2)@xmath1210@xmath18 m@xmath8 .",
    "the remainder of the system mass , ( 1.9@xmath160.2)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8  or @xmath19 40% , is tidal material ( see figure  [ figcap1 ] ) .",
    "the velocity structures of tol1924@xmath1416  and eso338@xmath1ig04b  have been studied in the h@xmath0line by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the optical and radio velocity fields is very good .",
    "the radio data confirms the weak large - scale ordered rotation in tol1924@xmath1416 , and the very ordered rotation in the companion system .",
    "note that the h  i  associated with the ly@xmath0-emitting system ( tol1924@xmath1416 ) is spread out over @xmath19 80 kms@xmath6  in radial velocity , suggesting that there is not a static screen of neutral gas along the line of sight to the starburst region .",
    "tol1924@xmath1416  shows a variety of interesting characteristics in optical imaging .",
    "@xcite used multicolor hst images to derive the cluster formation history .",
    "the elevated star formation rate ( @xmath19 few m@xmath8yr@xmath6 ) has been present for @xmath19 40 myr , and shows evidence for propagation throughout the disk .",
    "there appears to be little to no reddening in this system , in agreement with expectations based on the sample of lbgs in @xcite . while each of these parameters likely influence the propagation of ly@xmath0   photons through the ism",
    ", our observations suggest that the ism kinematics are also an important factor in this process .",
    "the angular distance between the two galaxies is @xmath19 6.6 , corresponding to a minimum deprojected distance of @xmath19 72 kpc .",
    "the total radial velocity extent is @xmath19 150 kms@xmath6  ( v@xmath20 @xmath3 2830 kms@xmath6 ) , but components exist in both systems at the same velocities .",
    "hence it seems likely that these two systems may now be gravitationally bound .",
    "regardless , the extended nature of the h  i  suggests that the present starburst in tol1924@xmath1416   likely was triggered by a strong gravitational interaction with eso338@xmath1ig04b , and that the different star formation rates in these two otherwise similar systems [ comparable h  i  masses ( see above ) and stellar masses ( see \" ostlin etal .",
    "2001 ) ] are attributable to the recent tidal interaction between them .      in figure  [ figcap2 ] we present contours of the zeroth - moment ( total column density ) image overlaid on a dss optical image of iras08339 + 6517 , as well as an intensity - weighted velocity field .",
    "we detect a total integrated flux of 3.68@xmath160.46jykms@xmath6  from the iras08339 + 6517  system ; this compares well with the single - dish value derived from nanay observations , 3.81jykms@xmath6   @xcite , again suggesting negligible flux loss due to lack of zero - spacing baselines . at the adopted distance of 80 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a total h  i  mass of ( 5.6@xmath160.7)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8 .",
    "we find ( 1.1@xmath160.2)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8  of h  i  to be associated with iras08339 + 6517 . its companion system , 2masxj08380769 + 6508579 , is found to have a total h  i  content of ( 7.0@xmath160.9)@xmath1210@xmath18 m@xmath8 , leaving the remaining ( 3.8@xmath160.5)@xmath1210@xmath17 m@xmath8  to reside in tidal material between the two systems .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the neutral gas ( @xmath19 70% ) in this interacting system has been removed from one or both galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the peak single - plane column density is found in tidal material and is not associated with either galaxy .",
    "@xcite have shown from the analysis of hst / stis high - resolution uv spectroscopy that in front of the central @xmath19 5 kpc ( 13 ) of this galaxy a column density @xmath19 10@xmath21 @xmath11 of neutral gas is outflowing with a velocity of around @xmath1300 kms@xmath6 .",
    "this flow of material leaving the central area of iras08339 + 6517  could be feeding the region between both galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the neutral gas in this intermediate region is approaching us with an average velocity of around @xmath1100 kms@xmath6 .",
    "however , no neutral gas is detected in the stis observations at the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( v@xmath22 @xmath3 5750 kms@xmath6 ) derived from these radio observations .",
    "this implies the existence of finer details in the velocity structure than can be inferred from these h  i  observations ( e.g. , an expanding shell powered by the starburst ; see mas - hesse etal .   2003 ) .",
    "the distance of iras08339 + 6517  ( 80 mpc ) precludes detailed optical studies of the stellar or cluster populations .",
    "inferences about other intrinsic properties of the galaxy must therefore rely on spectral data .",
    "@xcite measure an h@xmath0  flux corresponding to a star formation rate of @xmath19 8 m@xmath8yr@xmath6 ( applying the prescription of * ? ? ?",
    "the measured reddening reaches values as large as e(b@xmath1v ) @xmath3 0.5 mag .",
    ", suggesting substantial amounts of dust in this system .",
    "again we note that these factors likely contribute to the propagation of ly@xmath0  photons .",
    "however , since this starburst region appears to suffer from substantial reddening , the importance of ism kinematics in doppler shifting the ly@xmath0  photons out of resonance appears to be pronounced .    for a measured angular separation of 2.4 ,",
    "the implied minimum separation is 56 kpc .",
    "the h  i  radial velocity extent is @xmath19 300 kms@xmath6 ; this suggests that the neutral gas surrounding iras08339 + 6517  is highly turbulent , having been powered by the release of mechanical energy in the central starburst . at a smaller spatial scale",
    "the turbulence is still higher , as derived from uv spectroscopy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "while we can not definitively state that these galaxies now form a bound system , the effects of the gravitational interaction are pronounced in iras08339 + 6517 .",
    "interestingly , this starburst system shows two peaks of ly@xmath0  emission in our acs imaging , and may be the remnant of an earlier merger in its own right .",
    "on the other hand , the comparatively under - luminous nature of 2masxj08380769 + 6508579  ( i.e. , no obvious massive starburst episode in the current epoch ) suggests that the effects of the interaction have not been as severe for the secondary system .",
    "again , the less - massive system appears to retain a strong component of solid - body rotation .",
    "iras08339 + 6517  also appears to be undergoing organized rotation , but the neutral gas is spread out along the line of sight over @xmath19 80 kms@xmath6 .",
    "vla h  i  imaging of the starburst galaxies tol1924@xmath1416  and iras08339 + 6517  has been presented .",
    "these two systems are remarkably similar in h  i  content , mass , and current evolutionary state . in each ,",
    "we find extended neutral gas between the target and nearby neighbors , suggesting that interactions have played an important role in triggering the massive starbursts in the primary galaxies .",
    "the close proximity of the companions suggests that the interactions were recent , and the similar velocities of both primary and secondary galaxies argues that these systems may end up gravitationally bound .",
    "since both primary systems are intense ly@xmath0  emitters , these data support the interpretation that the ism kinematics are an important mechanism that affects the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from starburst regions . combined with the results on lbgs @xcite , these data have immediate implications for the use of the strength of ly@xmath0  emission in determining star formation rates , since the results will be dependent on the geometry of the ism and other factors ( e.g. , dust , star formation rate ) and not on properties inherent to the starburst being considered . further h  i  observations of ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies ( and , conversely , of starburst systems with no apparent ly@xmath0   emission ) are certainly warranted to further explore the role of the ism in regulating the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from starburst environments .",
