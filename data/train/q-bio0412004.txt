    "the need to maintain the thermodynamic stability of the native state is an important determinant of protein evolution .",
    "this requirement has different effects on the various positions of the protein , depending on their structural environment .",
    "therefore it is crucial to consider the effect of site - specific structural constraints in models of protein evolution , such as those used to estimate phylogenetic distances from the comparison of protein sequences ( nei and kumar , 2000 ) or to reconstruct phylogenetic trees through maximum likelihood methods ( felsenstein , 1981 ) .",
    "the first and simplest models of this kind assumes a gamma distribution of site - specific substitution rates ( see nei and kumar , 2000 ) .",
    "the gamma distribution is flexible enough to interpolate between broad and narrow distributions , and its free parameter improves considerably the fit between models of evolution and multiple sequence alignments .",
    "subsequently , site - specific amino acid frequencies ( halpern and bruno , 1998 ) and site - specific substitution matrices determined for different structural classes ( li and goldman , 1998 ; koshi and goldstein , 1998 ; koshi et al . , 1999 ; thorne , 2000 ; parisi and echave , 2001 ; fornasari et al . , 2002 ) were shown to further improve the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees . in these works ,",
    "site - specificity is either empirically derived from the data or simulated with the help of some protein model . following the latter approach",
    ", we recently showed that a structural property , the principal eigenvector ( pe ) of the contact matrix , is a strong predictor of site - specific amino acid conservation in models of protein evolution with stability constraints ( bastolla et al . , 2004b ) .",
    "we represent the amino acid sequence through a real - valued , site - specific profile , using the interactivity parameters derived by bastolla et al.(2004b ) .",
    "the interactivity scale expresses the strength of effective interactions for each amino acid type , and its main component is the hydropathy .",
    "the interactivity parameters correlate more strongly than other hydropathy scales with thermodynamic quantities like the thermodynamic effect of a mutation , with genomic quantities such as the genome size and the genome - wide gc content in bacterial genomes , and with the main component of substitution matrices , as we discuss in the present paper .    by using the interactivity parameters and the pe as a structural indicator",
    ", we recently derived analytic expressions to predict site - specific amino acid distributions ( porto et al . , 2004b ) .",
    "amino acid distributions with a similar functional form have also been used previously by other authors ( koshi and goldstein , 1998 ; koshi et al .",
    "1999 ; dokholyan et al .  2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "our predictions are in very good agreement with the distributions observed in the protein data bank .",
    "here we consider simple mutational models at the nucleotide level , and we show that they improve the fit between predicted and observed distributions .",
    "interestingly , the mutational model that best fits the observed data is one for which deleterious mutations eliminated by negative selection appear with almost the lowest rate .",
    "we represent a protein structure as a @xmath0 binary contact matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of residues . the element @xmath1 is equal to one",
    "if amino acids @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in contact in the native structure ( i.e.  at least one pair of their respective heavy atoms is closer than @xmath5 ) , and zero otherwise .",
    "the contact matrix is symmetric , so it has @xmath2 real eigenvalues .",
    "the pe is the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue and is indicated by @xmath6 .",
    "this vector maximizes the quadratic form @xmath7 with the constraint @xmath8 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath9 can be interpreted as the effective connectivity of position @xmath3 , since positions with large @xmath9 are in contact with as many as possible positions @xmath4 with large @xmath10 .",
    "all its components have the same sign , which we choose by convention to be positive .",
    "moreover , if the contact matrix represents a single connected graph ( as for single - domain globular proteins ) , the information contained in the principal eigenvector is sufficient to reconstruct the whole contact matrix ( porto et al .",
    ", 2004a ) .",
    "as we will review in this paper , the pe provides a convenient vectorial representation of a protein structure to be used in evolutionary studies .",
    "the effective free energy for a sequence @xmath11 in configuration @xmath12 is estimated through an effective contact free energy function @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a @xmath16 symmetric matrix whose element @xmath17 represents the effective interaction , in units of @xmath18 , of amino acids @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; we use the interaction matrix derived by bastolla et al.(2001 ) . for this interaction matrix the free energy function , eq .  ( [ eq : energy ] ) , is lower for the native structure than for decoys generated by threading ( bastolla et al . , 2001 ) .    the effective energy function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , can be approximated through the main component of its spectral decomposition @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the largest eigenvalue ( in absolute value ) of the matrix @xmath17 and @xmath24 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "the latter is mainly due to the contribution of hydrophobic interactions , as it is well known ( casari et al . , 1992 ; li et al . , 1997",
    "we therefore call the @xmath2-dimensional vector @xmath25 the hydrophobicity profile ( hp ) of sequence @xmath11 ( bastolla et al . , 2004b ) .",
    "the 20 parameters @xmath24 obtained from the principal eigenvector of the interaction matrix are called _ interactivity _ parameters ( ih ) .",
    "we will also use an optimized interactivity scale that was obtained by bastolla et al .",
    "( 2004b ) by optimizing the correlation between the hp and the pe over a large set of proteins . since the pe represents an effective connectivity , we indicate the latter scale with the abbreviation ch .",
    "we consider eleven hydropathy scales , including the two interactivity scales described above .",
    "they are : ( 1 )  the kd hydropathy scale , derived to identify trans - membrane helices using diverse experimental data ( kyte and doolittle , 1982 ) ; ( 2 )  the l76 hydropathy scale , which was derived by using experimental data and theoretical calculations ( levitt , 1976 ) ; ( 3 )  the r88 hydropathy scale , which is based on the transfer of solutes from water to alkane solvents ( roseman , 1988 ) ; ( 4 )  the augmented whilmey - white ( ww ) hydropathy scale , derived to improve recognition of trans - membrane helices ( jayasinghe et al . , 2001 ) ; ( 5 )  the g98 classification of amino acids into polar , hydrophobic , and amphiphylic classes , adopted by gu et al .  ( 1998 ) to investigate the relationship between the hydrophobicity of a protein and the nucleotide composition of the corresponding gene ; ( 6 )  the mp hydropathy scale , derived from statistical properties of globular proteins ( manavalan and ponnuswamy , 1978 ) ; ( 7 )  the av hydropathy scale derived by averaging 127 normalized hydropathy scales published in the literature ( palliser and parry , 2001 ) ; ( 8)  the fp hydropathy scale , derived from the experimental measurement of octanol / water partition coefficients ( fauchere and pliska , 1983 ) ; ( 9 )  the z04 scale , also called buriability , proposed by zhou and zhou ( 2004 ) ; ( 10 )  the interaction scale ih , obtained from the main eigenvector of the interaction matrix @xmath17 used in this work ( bastolla et al .",
    ", 2004b ) ; ( 11 )  the optimized interactivity scale , or connectivity scale ch , which maximizes the correlation with the principal eigenvectors of protein contact matrices for a non - redundant set of protein data bank ( pdb ) structures ( bastolla et al . , 2004b ) .",
    "all these scales have pairwise correlation coefficients ranging from a minimum of @xmath26 ( between the kd and l76 scales ) to a maximum of @xmath27 ( between ih and ch scales ) .      in the structurally constrained neutral ( scn ) model ( bastolla et al . , 1999 , 2002 , 2003a , 2003b ) ,",
    "starting from the protein sequence in the pdb , amino acid mutations are randomly proposed and accepted according to a stability criterion based on an effective model of protein folding ( bastolla et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "this `` structural '' approach has been pioneered by schuster and co - workers , with a series of studies of neutral networks of rna secondary structures ( schuster et al .",
    ", 1994 ; huynen et al . , 1996 ; fontana and schuster , 1998 ) and",

    "tiana et al . , 1998 ; mirny and shakhnovich , 1998 ; dokholyan and shakhnovich , 2001 ; parisi and echave , 2001 ) .",
    "for testing the stability of a protein conformation , we use two computational parameters : ( i )  the effective energy per residue , @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , where @xmath2 is the protein length .",
    "this quantity correlates with the folding free energy per residue for a set of 18 small proteins that are folding with two - states thermodynamics ( correlation coefficient @xmath29 ; u.  bastolla , unpublished result ) ; ( ii )  the normalized energy gap @xmath30 , which characterizes fast folding model sequences ( bastolla et al . , 1998 ) with well correlated energy landscapes ( bryngelson and wolynes , 1987 ; goldstein et al . , 1992",

    "is considered thermodynamically stable if both computational parameters are above predetermined thresholds ( bastolla et al . , 2003a ) .",
    "simulations of the scn model were performed for several protein folds .",
    "they all show the same two features : ( 1 )  after a very long evolutionary time , the protein sequence looses all recognizable similarity with the starting sequence , despite conserving the stability of its native fold .",
    "( 2 )  structural conservation varies across protein positions .",
    "the main structural determinant of evolutionary conservation is the principal eigenvector of the contact matrix .",
    "we obtain site - specific amino acid distributions from the pdb as follows .",
    "first , we select a non - redundant set of single - domain globular proteins , i.e.  sequences with more than 90% homology with other chains in the pdb are excluded . a non - redundant list of proteins is given in the file ` nrdb90 ` , available at the pdb web site .",
    "qualitatively equivalent results were obtained using the list selected with the method by hobohm and sanders ( 1994 ) with the much lower threshold of 25% sequence identity .",
    "globular proteins are selected through the condition that the fraction of contacts per residue should be larger than a length - dependent threshold , @xmath31 .",
    "this functional form represents the scaling of the number of contacts in globular proteins as a function of chain length ( the factor @xmath32 comes from the surface to volume ratio ) , and the two parameters are chosen so as to eliminate outliers with respect to the general trend , which are mainly non - globular structures .",
    "single - domain proteins are selected by imposing the normalized variance of the pe components to be smaller than a threshold , @xmath33 .",
    "multi - domain proteins have large pe components inside their main domains and small components outside them .",
    "the pe components would be exactly zero outside the main domain if the domains do not form contacts .",
    "therefore , multi - domain proteins are characterized by a larger normalized variance of pe components with respect to single - domain ones .",
    "the threshold of @xmath34 eliminates most of the known multi - domain proteins and very few of the known single - domain proteins ( data not shown ) .",
    "the proteins are divided into groups according to their length .",
    "a first group comprises proteins with less than @xmath35 amino acids and contains about @xmath36 sites .",
    "a second group comprises proteins of length between @xmath37 and @xmath38 amino acids and contains @xmath39 sites .",
    "these two groups are joined to improve the statistics in cases where we are not interested in length dependence .",
    "a third group comprises proteins with length between @xmath40 and @xmath41 amino acids and contains @xmath42 sites . within each group ,",

    "this information - theoretical distance measure , however , does not take into account the physico - chemical similarities between amino acids . in the present context , it is natural to focus our attention on the amino acid interactivity @xmath24 , which determines the predicted site - specific distributions .",

    "the procedure described by henikoff and henikoff ( 1992 ) for calculating substitution matrices starts by generating a multiple sequence alignment and counting the amino acid distribution at each position , @xmath57 . for large number of aligned positions ,",

    "using eq .",

    "usually , the eigenvectors @xmath59 of a @xmath0 symmetric matrix @xmath60 are normalized such that their squared components sum to one , @xmath61 .",
    "in this case , the spectral decomposition of the matrix can be expressed as @xmath62 the relative importance of each eigenvector , however , does not only depend on the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath63 , but also on the average eigenvector component . to make this dependence more explicit , it is convenient to transform the eigenvectors in such a way that their average component is zero and their variance is one , _",

    "the first term in the square brackets is the same for all pairs @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the second term is proportional to the sum of the normalized eigenvector components , and the third term is proportional to their product .",
    "therefore , we define two combinations of the eigenvalues and the mean eigenvector components as    @xmath68    and @xmath69",
    "it is well known that hydrophobicity is one of the main determinants of protein thermodynamics .",
    "gromiha et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that properties reflecting hydrophobicity correlate with the stability of buried mutations .",
    "we tested the ability of various hydrophobicity scales to predict the average effect of single amino acid mutations ( bastolla , unpublished ) .",
    "we use a database of more than @xmath70 mutants , selected by guerois et al.(2002 ) .",
    "we average the change in folding free energy for each amino acid substitution present in this database with more than four examples .",
    "these average changes are correlated with the difference of hydrophobicity parameters for various hydropathy scales .",
    "the rationale for testing these correlations is that , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) , it follows that the difference between the effective unfolding free energy of a protein mutated at position @xmath3 and the wild - type is proportional to @xmath71 \\ , \\sum_j c_{ij } \\ , h(a_j)$ ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "lastly , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) numerically for a mutation matrix obtained by considering all nucleotide mutations as equiprobable .",
    "this process has a stationary distribution that is almost proportional to the number of codons of each amino acid .",
    "accordingly , its prediction coincides almost perfectly with the one obtained by choosing @xmath72 proportional to the number of codons , even if detailed balance is not assumed .",
    "this result justifies the approximation of considering matrices that satisfy detailed balance .",
    "results corresponding to various models are summarized in table  [ tab : w ] .      using the mutation matrix @xmath73 and the fixation probability eq .",
    "( [ eq - fix ] ) , we can compute the equilibrium fraction of mutations which are eliminated by negative selection at site @xmath3 with boltzmann parameter @xmath74 ( we omit the index @xmath3 for simplicity ) , @xmath75 the computation of this quantity requires to know the mutation matrix , whereas our assumption of detailed balance only requires to specify the stationary nucleotides frequencies under no selection ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "therefore , we evalutate the rejection rate through the average of the absolute value of the boltzmann parameters @xmath77 .    among the models that we considered , @xmath77 is lowest for the more elaborate model taking into account nucleotide frequencies . among all possible nucleotide frequencies ,",
    "the lowest value of @xmath77 is @xmath78 , and it is attained at nucleotide frequencies close to those giving the optimal fit , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "even lower values of @xmath83 and better fits can be obtained deriving the @xmath72 from the amino acid frequencies observed at specific values of the pe component ( the minimum value of latexmath:[$\\left <    @xmath72 coincide with the frequencies observed at @xmath85 ) , but these values are ad - hoc since they are not the result of a mutational model .",
    "these results suggest that mutation frequencies are set to almost optimize the mutational load .",
    "kinjo and nishikawa ( 2004 ) recently calculated substitution matrices derived from protein alignments with various values of the sequence identity of the aligned proteins .",
    "qualitatively , these substitution matrices measure the tendency of two residue of types @xmath19 and @xmath20 to co - occur at aligned sites .",
    "kinjo and nishikawa noticed that the eigenvector corresponding to the largest positive eigenvalue of the substitution matrices is correlated with the hydrophobicity , and that the corresponding eigenvalue increases with decreasing sequence alignment , corresponding to longer evolutionary time .",
    "we examine the substitution matrices calculated by kinjo and nishikawa for various sequence identities , and we consider for comparison the matrix blosum62 ( henikoff and henikoff , 1992 ) . we also obtain a new substitution matrix from the alignment of pdb structures based on the normalized pe components , as described in materials and methods .",
    "this latter substitution matrix can also be predicted analytically using the formulas for site - specific distributions given above .",
    "its non - diagonal elements are correlated with the corresponding elements of the blosum62 matrix , with @xmath86 .",
    "however its diagonal elements are much smaller than the corresponding blosum elements , since all 20 amino acids can be found with fairly large frequencies at each aligned position .",
    "we calculate the correlation of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest positive eigenvalue of these substitution matrices with the hydrophobicity scales described in materials and methods . for almost all matrices , the largest correlation ( with @xmath87 to @xmath88 )",
    "is found for the optimized interactivity parameters , but the correlation is very high also for other scales , see table  [ tab : hydro ] .",
    "we then computed the normalized eigenvalue of this eigenvector , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ell - prod ] ) . from its behavior as a function of sequence identity",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : subst_mat ] ) one sees that the contribution of the hydrophobicity to the substitution matrices becomes more important for lower identities of the aligned proteins , _",
    "i.e. _ for increased evolutionary time .",
    "the blosum matrix corresponds to an intermediate value , whereas the matrix obtained from aligned pdb structure is completely dominated by hydrophobicity , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : substmat ] ) .",
    "this matrix corresponds to the limit of very long evolutionary time , where all sequence similarity is lost , apart for that originated by the common structural environment expressed by the pe .",
    "therefore , this study of substitution matrices further supports our results on the relationship between the pe and sequence evolution .",
    "it is well known that the hydrophobicity is a major determinant of protein stability and evolution .",
    "we have shown that , among several hydropathy scales , the optimized interactivity scale ( bastolla et al . , 2004b ) is the one best correlated with various thermodynamic and genomic quantities .",
    "the influence of the hydrophobicity on protein stability has two sides : on the one hand , the more hydrophobic a protein is , the more stable is with respect to unfolding ; on the other hand it is less stable with respect to misfolding , so that a careful tuning of the hydrophobic content is needed ( bastolla et al . , 2004a ) .",
    "close to the optimal hydrophobicity , small variations have complex effects that might reduce their impact on fitness .",
    "this is probably the reason why the mutational bias is able to influence hydrophobicity and hence protein folding thermodynamics .",
    "large variations of the mean hydrophobicity , however , are not tolerated in the course of evolution .    in order to achieve folding stability ,",
    "we have predicted that the hydrophobicity should be distributed within the protein sequence in a site - specific manner , which is mainly influenced by a site - specific indicator ",
    "the principal eigenvector of the contact matrix ( pe ) . from the hypothesis that the correlation between the hydrophobicity and the pe is the only condition imposed by folding stability on sequence evolution , we predicted analytically site - specific amino acid distributions to be of boltzmann type , in agreement with simulations of the scn model of protein evolution and with structural alignments of sites with equivalent pe taken from the pdb .",
    "finally , we have discussed how simple mutational models improve the fit between predicted and observed site - specific distributions .",
    "interestingly , the model that provides the best fit is also one with almost the lowest rate of rejected mutations .",
