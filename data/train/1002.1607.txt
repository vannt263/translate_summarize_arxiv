    "first , due to the presence of fugacity factors in ( [ correlated state ] ) , the gutzwiller projection does not change the local densities of spin up ( down ) electrons , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "next , this formalism may , in principle , be systematically extended beyond the second order in the inter - site quantities ( formulas of ref .",

    "also , it can be relatively easily applied to the extensions of hamiltonian ( [ t - j exact ] ) , or to the more complicated symmetry - breaking situations .",

    "next , we have to determine the optimal values of mean - fields appearing in a model .",

    "even if some way of replacing @xmath31 ( [ generalnog ] ) by the operator counterpart may seem more natural than others , there is in fact no unique way of carrying out such procedure .",

    "we present those parts of our approach which are relevant to the present discussion . in section [ results ]",

    "the most of standard mean - field models may be solved by employing two methods .",

    "however , those two routes are equivalent only for mf hamiltonians of the hartree - fock type ( e.g. the bcs hamiltonian ) @xcite . in the case of rmft for the t - j model",
    ", the self - consistency of the mf formalism may be spoiled by unwary application of such variational procedure , for both nonzero temperatures and for @xmath32 .",
    "this due to the non - hartree character of the rmft hamiltonian , caused by mf treatment of the gutzwiller projection .",
    "in such situation , the non variational self - consistent method based on the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations is usually applied to those advanced versions of rmft , @xcite . however",
    ", this route suffers from serious drawbacks @xcite .",
    "the other solution is the appropriate modification of the variational method .",
    "examples of such self - consistent variational mf approach may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the approaches of those references exhibit various degree of generality , and differ from each other with respect to technical details .",
    "yet , all are based on the variational principle of quantum mechanics ( minimization of the expectation value of the hamiltonian ) , applied to the mf case . as such , they are applicable to @xmath32 situation only .",
    "our point of departure is different .",
    "we base our approach ( @xcite ) on the _ maximum entropy principle _",
    "( maxent ) @xcite , which is the basis of bayesian mathematical statistics .",
    "in particular , it may be viewed also as the basis of the standard ( non mean - field ) statistical mechanics @xcite . the application of maxent inference to the non - standard case of mf statistical - mechanical description is a natural extension of this fundamental principle ( @xcite , c.f .",
    "also @xcite ) . to ensure the self consistency of mf description ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce additional constraints , not present in the standard statistical mechanics .",
    "this could be achieved in the most natural manner by the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "explicitly , starting from an arbitrary mf hamiltonian @xmath33 , we define yet another mf hamilton operator @xmath34 according to appearing in ( [ gmf hamiltonian with lambdas ] ) should not be confused with the fugacity factors @xmath16 appearing in eqn .",
