    "in the vicinity of the band edge strong coupling of light with exciton resonances leads to a splitting of the light dispersion , known as polariton effect . besides the well - known fabry - perot modes the spatial dispersion leads to an additional series of interferences of polariton waves above the exciton resonances @xcite .",
    "the behavior of amplitude and phase of the reflected light around these resonances was investigated in @xcite for a @xmath1 znse layer , which was grown on a gaas buffer and cladded by znsse layers .",
    "characteristic changes of the phase were found around the polariton interferences , which in particular are sensitive to the damping of the excitonic resonances .",
    "the theoretical description was based on a broadened elliot formula @xcite for the susceptibility of the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) exciton resonances in the active znse layer including the spatial dispersion .",
    "pekar s additional boundary conditions ( abc s ) @xcite were applied and according to the microscopic approach in @xcite a weak penetration of the polarization into the cladding layers was taken into account .",
    "the good agreement of the experimental results for the reflection with our theoretical model enables to reconstruct the absorbed intensity of a probe pulse in the sample , while the transmitted beam is completely absorbed in the gaas buffer .",
    "+ in this paper we additionally investigate the light emission of the sample at low excitation .",
    "the experimental results are presented in the following section .",
    "a quantum mechanical and many - body description of emission was given in @xcite based on keldysh s technique for photon green s functions ( gf s ) .",
    "however , in this approach spatial dispersion was neglected . a theoretical description of the emission including spatial dispersion is a non - trivial problem . in @xcite",
    "the problem of energy conservation was discussed in the context of the dielectric approximation ( da ) .",
    "recently , starting from energy conservation , one of us ( k.h . ) @xcite presented an exact proof that the ratio between incoherent emission @xmath2 and coherent absorption @xmath3 is given by the polariton distribution @xmath4 which for quasi - equilibrium tends towards a bose distribution . in section  [ secthe ]",
    "we give a short outline of this approach and demonstrate that the theoretical concept agrees with the experimental findings .",
    "our experiments were performed at a sample grown by molecular beam epitaxy and composed of a @xmath0 znse layer , cladded by two @xmath5 @xmath6 layers with a sulfur content of @xmath7 .",
    "the sample was contained in a he - flow cryostat and cooled to a temperature of @xmath8 .",
    "the experiments were carried out using @xmath9 ( fwhm ) pulses with a spectral linewidth of @xmath10 ( fwhm ) centered at different photon energies in order to cover the whole spectral domain between the heavy- and light - hole exciton resonances of the znse layer . for details of the measurement of the reflection",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the emission was detected after excitation with pump pulses , which were focused on the surface of the sample with a spot diameter of @xmath11 under perpendicular incidence .",
    "the emitted light was measured under an angle of @xmath12 by a triple additive grating spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 0.1 mev .",
    "the emission was recorded by integrating the spectrometer s ccd over a train of many pump pulses .",
    "the pulse repetition rate is @xmath13 , which corresponds to a repetition period of @xmath14 .",
    "+ the results of our measurements are presented in fig .",
    "the spectrum of reflectivity is given by solid black lines in both parts of the figure .",
    "the emitted intensity after pumping with pulses ( thin black lines ) centered at two different energies ( left : at the hh - exciton , right : between hh- and lh - exciton ) is presented with dashed red lines .",
    "the emission is scaled to be comparable with the reflectivity .",
    "additionally , the positions of the exciton resonances are marked by vertical dashed lines .",
    "generally , the emission is concentrated on the polariton interference modes",
    ". however , the amplitude of the emission peaks strongly decreases with increasing energy .",
    "in @xcite it was found that in dependence of the geometry of the sample even or odd polariton modes appear more or less pronounced .",
    "as one can see from the figure , this may be different concerning reflectivity and emission .",
    "while in the reflection the first peak directly above the 1s - hh exciton is much higher than the second one , in the emission the weight is shifted more to the second peak .",
    "we demonstrated in our theoretical analysis in section  [ secthe ] that the shape of the emission is related to the distribution function of excited polariton states , which are generated by the pump pulse .",
    "in this section we start with a general description of wave propagation through a slab of finite thickness @xmath15 with the aim to demonstrate that there is a general connection between emission and absorption , summarizing those points of the approach in @xcite which are important for the understanding of the present paper .",
    "the slab is considered to be infinitely extended in the transverse @xmath16-@xmath17-direction , and homogeneously excited . for notational simplicity , te - polarized light propagating freely in the transverse direction is considered .",
    "due to cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath18-axis , the transverse vector potential @xmath19 can be chosen in the @xmath17-direction . assuming steady state conditions , the propagation equation for the averaged field , after fourier transforming with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in this geometry has the structure @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inverse of the retarded photon gf @xmath24 here and in what follows , the variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which enter all equations parametrically",

    "then from ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , and ( [ 13 ] ) , for any frequency @xmath70 and propagation direction @xmath71 , we obtain for the spectrally and directionally resolved energy flow ( emission ) @xmath72 the distribution @xmath4 is accessible to direct observation in experiments measuring the ( incoherent ) emission and the classical absorption , i.e. , transmission and reflection .",

    "the experimental results could not be verified applying ting s abc s @xcite .",
