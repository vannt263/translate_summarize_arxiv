    "it has far - reaching implications for biomedical applications such as the surgical occlusion of cerebral aneurysms , where the friction coefficient is estimated to be well above the critical value reported here and where common simulations ignore deformations of the arterial walls ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "while friction can cause problems during injection @xcite , our results suggest that it is nevertheless highly desirable in order to obtain a broader spatial distribution of loops , which is known to assist in stabilization @xcite .",
    "elastic threads with circular topology develop four different morphologies when flexibly confined @xcite .",
    "we have found in this letter that only two prevail when linear threads are injected instead .",
    "the reason is that elastic rings possess an instability when confined in spherical shells that linear threads do not possess : they are ( initially ) in full contact with the inner surface of the shell and can either buckle away from it or not .",
    "they remain on the two - dimensional surface in rigid spheres and are enabled to pack in a three - dimensional fashion in flexible shells .",
    "linear wires , on the other hand , are never in full contact with the shell , due to their moment - free ends and the injection at a right angle .",
    "they hence avoid being trapped in the energetically unfavorable surface packing configuration , avoiding the instability in the first place .",
    "an open question is the sensitivity of the packing behavior to material nonlinearity .",
    "it could also be worthwhile to determine the functional dependence of the exponents and critical points reported here on the system parameters to obtain a full image of the four - dimensional parameter space ."
