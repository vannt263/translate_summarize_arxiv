    "spin glasses ( sgs ) are the type of random magnets possessing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings , and are characterized by frustration and randomness .",
    "the ordering of sg has been studied quite extensively as a typical example of `` complex system '' and continues to give an impact on surrounding areas @xcite .",
    "most of theoretical and numerical studies on the sg ordering have been based on a simplified statistical model called the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model , in which the spins are put on each site of a regular lattice and interact via the random coupling taking both positive ( ferromagnetic ) and negative ( antiferromagnetic ) signs @xcite .",
    "for the _ ising _ ea model in three dimensions ( 3d ) , it is now well established that the model exhibits an equilibrium sg transition at a finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents of the sg transition evaluated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were compared favorably with those determined experimentally for the ising - like sg compound femntio@xmath3 @xcite .    meanwhile , many of real sg magnets , including the well - studied canonical sgs , _",
    "i.e. _ , dilute magnetic alloys such as cumn , aufe and agmn , are the _ heisenberg - like _ magnets possessing only weak magnetic anisotropy .",
    "thus , an isotropic heisenberg ea model , rather than the strongly anisotropic ising ea model , is expected to be a more realistic model .",
    "experimentally , the existence of a finite - temperature sg transition and of a thermodynamic sg state in real heisenberg - like sg material has been established @xcite .    for the 3d isotropic heisenberg ea model , earlier numerical studies suggested , in apparent contrast to the experimental observation , that the model exhibited only a zero - temperature transition @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , one of present author ( h.k . ) suggested that the model might exhibit a finite - temperature transition _ in its chiral sector _",
    "chirality is a multispin variable representing the handedness of the noncollinear or noncoplanar structures induced by frustration .",
    "it has subsequently been suggested that , in the ordering of the 3d heisenberg sg , the chirality was `` decoupled '' from the spin , the chiral - glass ( cg ) order taking place at a temperature higher than the sg order , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "based on such a spin - chirality decoupling picture of the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg , a chirality scenario of experimental sg transition was proposed @xcite : according to this scenario , the chirality is a hidden order parameter of sg transition .",
    "real sg transition of weakly anisotropic sg magnets is then a `` disguised '' cg transition , where the chirality is mixed into the spin sector via a weak random magnetic anisotropy . for a recent review ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref.@xcite    the chirality scenario is capable of explaining several long - standing puzzles concerning the experimental sg transition @xcite in a natural way , such as the origin of the non - ising critical exponents observed in canonical sgs @xcite , the apparent absence of the heisenberg - to - ising crossover in the measured nonlinear susceptibility @xcite , and the origin of the mean - field - like transition lines ( the so - called at and gt lines ) often observed experimentally in the sg phase diagram in magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the chirality scenario remains to be an attractive hypothesis in consistently explaining various experimental observations for canonical sgs , and hence , it is an important task to examine the validity of the basic assumption underlying this scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ , the occurrence of the spin - chirality decoupling in the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg .    in recent numerical studies of the 3d heisenberg ea model , consensus now seems to appear that the 3d heisenberg sg indeed exhibits a finite - temperature transition @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the transition , especially whether the model really exhibits the spin - chirality decoupling , is still under hot debate @xcite .",
    "the present situation is not completely satisfactory . mentioning some of the recent numerical works : hukushima and kawamura studied the model with the random @xmath5 coupling of modest lattice sizes @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the linear dimension ) but with a rather small number of samples of @xmath8 ( for their largest @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "these authors then concluded that @xmath9 is certainly finite , while @xmath10 is either zero or nonzero but less than @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , supporting the spin - chirality decoupling scenario .",
    "by contrast , lee and young claimed on the basis of their data of the correlation - length ratio @xmath12 of the model with the gaussian coupling that the spin and chirality order at a common temperature , thus no spin - chirality decoupling @xcite .",
    "however , their data suffer from either small lattice sizes of only @xmath13 @xcite or small number of samples of @xmath14 @xcite . recently ,",
    "campos _ et al _ simulated the same model to much larger lattices @xmath15 with larger number of samples @xmath16 , but no data below the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "et al _ claimed that the chiral and spin sectors undergo simultaneously a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition with massive logarithmic corrections .",
    "this interpretation , however , was criticized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    under such circumstances",
    ", we perform here a large - scale mc simulation of the 3d heisenberg sg in order to shed further light on the nature of its spin and chirality ordering .",
    "we exceed the previous simulations by simulating the system as large as @xmath15 to temperatures considerably lower than @xmath17 for large number of samples of order @xmath18 .",
    "note that none of the previous simulations satisfied all these criteria simultaneously .",
    "more importantly , we calculate several independent physical quantities including the correlation - length ratios , the binder ratios , the glass order parameters , the overlap distribution functions and the non - self - averageness parameters , trying to draw consistent picture from these independent quantities , whereas refs.@xcite concentrated almost exclusively on the correlation - length ratio . by controlling the correction - to - scaling effect in our data analysis",
    ", we can locate the chiral and spin transition points as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we then conclude that the sg transition occurs at a nonzero temperature which is located about 10@xmath2115% below the cg transition temperature .",
    "thus , the 3d heisenberg sg exhibits the spin - chirality decoupling .",
    "we also examine the possibility suggested in the previous works that the spin and chiral sectors undergo simultaneously a kt transition @xcite . from our new data of large sizes",
    "@xmath22 covering the temperature range below @xmath23 , we conclude that such a possibility can now be ruled out . in order to corroborate this conclusion",
    ", we also calculate the correlation - length ratio and the binder ratio for the 2d ferromagnetic _ xy _ model , the standard model exhibiting the kt transition , and compare the results with the ones of the 3d heisenberg sg .",
    "both the correlation - length ratio and the binder ratio exhibit quite different behaviors between the two models , demonstrating again that the transition of the 3d heisenberg sg is not of kt - type .",
    "recently , pixley and young questioned the utility of the binder ratio in studying the ordering of vector sg models which is characterized by many - component tensorial order parameter @xcite . to examine the validity of this claim",
    ", we also simulate the ferromagnetic 3d @xmath24 heisenberg model , a model with a large number of order - parameter components @xmath25 . by calculating the correlation - length ratio and the binder ratio of the model , and by comparing them with those of the 3d heisenberg sg ,",
    "we conclude that the binder ratio of the 3d vector sg carries useful information independent of the correlation - length ratio , and should not be regarded as behaving in a trivial manner .",
    "we analyze the critical properties associated with the cg transition . on the basis of a finite - size scaling analysis taking account of the leading correction - to - scaling ,",
    "we get estimates of the cg critical exponents as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the former being the cg correlation - length exponent and the latter the cg critical - point - decay exponent . in fact , these cg exponents are close to the exponent values reported in earlier works , and also turn out to be very close to the sg exponent values experimentally observed for canonical sgs .",
    "in fact , this coincidence gives a strong support to the chirality scenario .    in order to further probe the nature of the cg",
    "ordered state , we also calculate the overlap distribution function and the non - self - averaging parameter ( the so - called @xmath26 parameter ) both for the chirality and the spin .",
    "the cg ordered state turns out to be non - self - averaging .",
    "it also appears to exhibit a peculiar type of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) which closely resembles the so - called one - step rsb .",
    "the behavior of the binder ratio is fully consistent with such a one - step - like rsb picture .",
    "a preliminary account of the simulation was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we define our model and explain some of the details of our numerical method employed .",
    "particular attention is paid to the issue of thermalization , _",

    "recently , campos _ et al _ claimed on the basis of their data of the correlation - length that the chiral and spin sectors undergo simultaneously a kt transition @xcite .",
    "this interpretation , however , was criticized in ref.@xcite .",
    "more recently , lee and young also suggested on the basis of their data of the correlation - length ratios that the system exhibits a `` marginal '' behavior @xcite .",
    "in view of such recent claims on the model , we further examine here the possibility of a kt - type phase transition .",
    "first , we note that , with decreasing the temperature , our data of the cg and sg correlation - length ratios of various @xmath7 do not merge as expected for the kt transition , but intersect , with crossing points shifting to lower temperature for large @xmath7 . for temperatures below the crossing points , the @xmath54 and @xmath55 curves fan out , rather than becoming @xmath7-independent . in order to make a more direct comparison with the behavior of the kt transition",
    ", we calculate the correlation - length ratio @xmath12 for the ferromagnetic 2d _ xy _ model , a standard model displaying the kt transition .",

    "hence , our present data of either the cg or sg correlation - length ratio shown in fig.9 are radically different from the one of a typical kt transition shown in fig.21 : our data of @xmath12 curves of the 3d heisenberg sg are not `` merging''@xcite nor `` marginal '' @xcite , but splay out .",
    "in ref.@xcite , campos _ et al _ performed a kt - type scaling with massive logarithmic corrections for the sg correlation - length ratio @xmath55 , and reported that the data exhibited a good scaling .",
    "we also tried an exactly same scaling plot with the same logarithmic correction term as performed by campos _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and the result is shown in fig.13 .",
    "note that our present data include the low temperature range below @xmath9 which was not covered by the data by campos _",
    "et al_. ( the temperature range where campos _ et al _ reported their scaling plot is indicated by the dashed - line box in our fig.13 . )",
    "as is evident from fig.13 , the kt scaling turns out to be poor , even with invoking a massive logarithmic correction .",
    "we thus conclude that the possibility that the spin and chiral sectors undergo a simultaneous kt - type transition can be ruled out from our present data of the correlation - length ratio .",
    "the peculiar form of @xmath56 with a negative dip shown in fig.10(a ) is consistent with the occurrence of a one - step - like replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) as suggested by hukushima and kawamura @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by the form of the the calculated chiral - overlap distribution below @xmath9 to be shown later in fig.16(a ) , which exhibits a prominent central peak at @xmath170 .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding spin binder ratio @xmath57 shown in fig.10(b ) does not exhibit a crossing nor a merging in the temperature range studied , suggesting that the sg transition temperature , if any , occurs below @xmath171 .",
    "meanwhile , as the size @xmath7 is increased , @xmath57 develops more and more singular form at low temperature , indicating that the associated overlap distribution significantly changes its shape at low temperature .",

    "this feature of @xmath57 strongly suggests the occurrence of a sg transition at a nonzero temperature , @xmath174 . in order to locate @xmath10 from @xmath57 more directly ,",
    "however , we need the large - lattice data at lower temperatures .    in view of the suggestion of the kt - type transition in refs . @xcite and @xcite",

    "pixley and young recently criticized that the binder ratio might not be an appropriate quantity in studying the ordering of vector sgs , arguing that the large number of order - parameter components ( @xmath177 in the heisenberg sg ) might lead to a trivial gaussian distribution even below @xmath17 @xcite . to check the validity of such an expectation ,",

    "one may wonder if what happens if one uses the cg binder ratio in the analysis .",

    "such an exotic behavior of @xmath56 , _",
    "e.g. _ , the existence of a growing negative dip and the non - monotonic size dependence observed in certain temperature range above @xmath9 , is most probably reflecting the peculiarity of the cg ordered state itself , a possible one - step - like rsb feature , not just the sub - leading correction - to - scaling effect .",
    "if the peculiar behavior of @xmath56 arose reflecting the proximity of the nontrivial character of the cg ordered state , the finite - size - scaling analysis would not be applicable to @xmath56 in a straightforward way , at least in the range of lattice sizes studied here .",
    "finally , we wish to refer to the critical properties of the sg transition which is deduced to occur at @xmath243 . in  4 , we already estimated the critical - point - decay exponent from the size dependence of the sg order parameter @xmath59 as @xmath244 .",
    "we also tried a finite - size - scaling analysis of both @xmath55 and @xmath106 , either with or without a correction - to - scaling term , just as we performed for the cg transition .",
    "however , it turns out that the finite - size scaling analysis for the spin - related quantities does not work well for any choice of @xmath10 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 , even if we adjust the assumed parameter values in a wide range .",
    "possibly , the cg order that occurs preceding the sg order affects the scaling property of the spin - related quantities in a non - trivial way , and the data of still larger lattices and/or lower temperatures might be required to determine the critical properties of the sg transition .",
    "in summary , we have studied equilibrium ordering properties of the three - dimensional isotropic heisenberg spin glass by means of extensive monte carlo simulations . by calculating various physical quantities including the correlation - length ratio , the binder ratio , the glass order parameter and the overlap distribution function up to the size as large as @xmath15 and down to temperatures well below @xmath9 , we have given strong numerical evidence of successive cg and sg transitions occurring at @xmath19 and at @xmath247 , respectively .",
    "the sg order sets in at a temperature at least about 10@xmath2115% below the cg order , hence , the occurrence of the spin - chirality decoupling . on shorter length scale of @xmath166 , the spin and the chirality often behave in a similar way , while , on longer length scale of @xmath167 , the chirality shows a stronger ordering tendency than the spin .",
    "the observation supports the view of the trivial spin - chirality coupling at shorter length scale crossing over to the spin - chirality decoupling at longer length scale @xcite",
    ".    one may feel that the relative distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is not so large , but , in fact , it is a sizable difference , much larger than the one observed in other systems exhibiting the spin - chirality decoupling , _",
    "e.g. _ , the 2d regular frustrated _ xy _ model where the difference is known to be about 1% @xcite .",
    "while the sg order in the 3d heisenberg sg occurs at a nonzero temperature , as is consistent with the recent numerical works @xcite , it should be stressed that whether @xmath10 is zero or nonzero is irrelevant to the chirality scenario of refs.@xcite as long as the spin - chirality decoupling occurs , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 .",
    "we have observed a rather strong correction - to - scaling effect in our data , which , we have tried to control via the correction - to - scaling term with the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath248 .",
    "the analysis worked very well at least for the cg correlation length and the cg susceptibility .",
    "hence , our conclusion of @xmath11 appears to be robust against the correction - to - scaling effect .",
    "we have also analyzed the critical properties associated with the cg transition . by mean of a finite - size scaling analysis with including the correction - to - scaling effect , we get an estimate of chiral - glass exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the possibility of a simultaneous spin and chiral transition of the kt - type as suggested in refs.@xcite is ruled out . we have shown that the behaviors of both the correlation - length ratio and the binder ratio are entirely different from those of the 2d ferromagnetic _ xy _ model exhibiting the kt transition , and the kt scaling for these quantities does not work even with massive logarithmic corrections .",
    "the obtained values of the cg exponents are close to the values reported earlier in previous works , while they are entirely different from those of the 3d ising sg .",
    "however , these cg exponents are impressively close to the experimental values of sg exponents of canonical sgs like cumn , aufe , agmn , _ etc _ , _ i.e. _ , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "indeed , this coincidence gives a strong support to the chirality scenario of experimental sg transition of ref.@xcite , since , in this scenario , the experimental sg exponents of weakly anisotropic heisenberg - like sgs like canonical sgs are nothing but the cg exponents of the fully isotropic heisenberg sg revealed via the random magnetic anisotropy .",
    "a very interesting consequence of the chirality scenario is that the chiral - glass transition , _ not the spin - glass transition _ , of the fully isotropic heisenberg sg dictates the experimental sg transition .",
    "experimentally , it remains highly interesting to directly estimate the set of chiral - glass exponents by means of high - precision hall measurements @xcite .",
    "it might also be worthwhile to re - examine the standard spin - glass exponents for various heisenberg - like sg materials by controlling the magnitude of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "although various physical quantities have consistently suggested that the sg order occurs at a temperature lower than the cg transition temperature , a precise estimate of the sg transition temperature and of the corresponding sg exponents still remains to be a rather difficult task , although we get @xmath190 . in any case , the critical properties of the sg transition definitely differ from those of the cg transition , since the associated @xmath251 values are largely different .    by measuring the binder ratio , the overlap distribution function and the non - self - averageness parameter @xmath26 , we have observed that the chiral - glass ordered state is non - self - averaging and exhibits a nontrivial phase - space structure ( rsb ) .",
    "more precisely , we have observed a strong similarity to the systems exhibiting the so - called one - step rsb .",
    "we note that the one - step rsb feature was also observed in the same model in an off - equilibrium simulation probing the breaking pattern of the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "according to the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite , the properties of the sg ordered state of real canonical sgs should be governed by the properties of the cg ordered state of the fully isotropic heisenberg sg .",
    "if so , one - step - like rsb should eventually be an attribute of the sg ordered state of real canonical sgs .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the long - standing common belief in the community , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sg ordered state of real canonical sgs exhibits either the hierarchical rsb ( full rsb ) or no rsb .",
    "after the submission of the manuscript , the authors learned that fernadez _",
    "et al _ also studied the same model by mc simulations up to the size @xmath252 , and suggested that the spin and the chirality might order simultaneously @xcite .",
    "we wish to give a few comments here : first , we have confirmed that the data of @xmath22 reported in ref.@xcite now agree with our present data within the error bars .",
    "( this is somewhat in contrast to the data of ref.@xcite which deviate from our present data by 5 to 6 of our @xmath135 units . ) furthermore , the sg transition temperature reported in @xcite agrees with our present estimate @xmath144 .",
    "the major difference then concerns with the difference in the estimate of the chiral - glass transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy seems to be primarily originated from their @xmath252 @xmath54 data , which comes significantly smaller than the values expected from an extrapolation of the @xmath22 data made in our present analysis .",
    "if the @xmath252 chiral data of ref.@xcite are to be trusted , it means a drastic changeover occurring in the chiral sector between the sizes @xmath15 and @xmath252 .",
    "the physical origin of this size crossover , if any , has yet to be identified .",
    "meanwhile , since we do not have at the moment a plausible explanation of such a size - crossover , and since the equilibration of @xmath252 chiral quantities is the hardest and the number of @xmath252 samples studied in ref.@xcite ( 164 samples ) is significantly smaller than that of other sizes ( 984 samples ) , we feel that the @xmath252 data of ref.@xcite should be cross - checked carefully by independent calculations .",
    "overall , we believe that our present data give strong numerical support to the view that the spin - chirality decoupling occurs in the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg .",
    "then , it also give support to the chirality scenario of experimental sg transitions .",

    "hence , from the comparison of the correlation - length ratio @xmath12 and the binder ratio @xmath75 of the ferromagnetic 2d _ xy _ model and of the 3d heisenberg sg , one might also conclude that the transition of the 3d heisenberg sg is not of the kt - type .      in this appendix",
