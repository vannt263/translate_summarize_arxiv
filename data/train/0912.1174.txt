    "understanding hydrodynamic behaviour of matter in the immediate vicinity of a black hole is extremely important as the emitted radiation intensity from the flow depends on the density and temperature at each flow element at each moment of time .",
    "thus the spectral and temporal properties of emitted radiation is directly determined by the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "early known simulations were carried out by hawley , smarr & wilson ( 1984ab ) .",
    "however , the code may have been executed with flow parameters not giving rise to the steady shocks and as a result , the shocks were found to be propagating outward ( but see , hawley and smarr , 1986 where solutions with shock wave have been presented ) .",
    "chakrabarti & molteni ( 1993 ) and molteni , lanzafame & chakrabarti ( 1994 ) used smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( which preserves the specific angular momentum accurately because the ` particles ' are toroidal in shape ) to simulate one and two dimensional sub - keplerian flows and showed that flows become transonic and also produce standing shocks where they are predicted by well established theory of transonic flows ( chakrabarti , 1990 ; hereafter c90 ) .",
    "formation of steady shocks were seen in simulations which uses a grid based ( total variation diminishing , or tvd ) scheme also ( molteni , ryu & chakrabarti , 1996 ) . of course , if the initial condition of the flow is chosen to be random , the flow may show time dependent behaviour as the steady transonic solution is possible only when the initial parameters are from a definite region of the parameter space .",
    "this was shown to be the case by ryu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ryu , chakrabarti & molteni ( 1997 ) . using the tvd code",
    ", the latter authors showed that if the rankine - hugoniot condition is not satisfied , the shock is likely to oscillate .",
    "the oscillating shocks were also observed in presence of cooling ( molteni , sponholz , & chakrabarti , 1996 ; chakrabarti , acharyya & molteni , 2004 ) and were widely assumed to be the cause of the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in radiations emitted by accretion flows around black holes . since the generic physical processes which cause the oscillations of the shocks , and therefore , the oscillations in the emitted radiation are the same in both the stellar and the massive / super - massive black holes , a thorough study of the nature of shock oscillations and the dependence of the oscillation frequencies on flow parameters is essential .    in this paper , we present the results of a series of simulations which basically sample the entire region of the parameter space spanned by the specific energy and specific angular momentum ( chakrabarti , 1989 ; here after c89 ; c90 ) , i.e. , the parameter space relevant for non - dissipative , non - magnetic and axisymmetric hydrodynamic accretion flows .",
    "we use an axisymmetric grid based tvd code for this purpose .",
    "we obtain a large number of very important results , which , to our knowledge , have never been published before : ( a ) though as per injection condition at the outer boundary , the pre - shock flow properties match with the theoretical results of a constant height inflow , to our surprise , the post - shock flow properties match closely with the theoretical results obtained assuming a hybrid - model inflow ( chakrabarti , 1989 ) .",
    "what this means is that shock locations from simulations may be somewhat different from those of the theoretical result which assumes either the constant height or vertical equilibrium condition in the both sides of the shock .",
    "( b ) the average infall time scale from the post - shock region appears to be a few times longer than the free fall time scale due to turbulence .",
    "( c ) for majority of the flow parameters , the shocks are found to be stable , though they may oscillate around a mean location .",
    "( d ) because of the strong turbulence close to a black hole which is formed due to the interaction of the incoming wave and the flow bounced back from the centrifugal barrier , a weak shock is formed closer to the black hole , though , both the normal outer shock and the inner shock seem to oscillate with the same frequencies ",
    "the outer shock shows more power at lower oscillation frequency and the inner shock shows more power at higher oscillation frequencies .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following : in the next section , we present the procedure of the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) method .",
    "this is similar to what is used in ryu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) paper . in  3 , we test the code with a simple zero angular momentum solution . in molteni ,",
    "ryu & chakrabarti ( 1996 ) , some test results with shock solutions were already presented .",
    "present we discuss results of a large number of simulations and compare the results .",
    "finally in  4 , we make concluding remarks .",
    "the setup of our simulation is the same as in ryu , chakrabarti & molteni ( 1997 ) .",
    "we consider the adiabatic hydrodynamics of axisymmetric flows of gas under the newtonian gravitational field of a point mass @xmath0 located at the centre in cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we also assume that the gravitational field of the black hole can be described by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) , @xmath2 where , @xmath3 and the schwarzschild radius is given by @xmath4 .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath0 , the speed of light @xmath5 , and the schwarzschild radius @xmath6 are assumed to be the units of the mass , the velocity , and the length respectively .",
    "we use @xmath7 , and @xmath8 as the dimensionless distances along x - axis and z - axis in the rest of the paper .",
    "we also assume a polytropic equation of state for the accreting ( or , outflowing ) matter , @xmath9 , where , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the isotropic pressure and the matter density respectively , @xmath12 is the adiabatic index ( assumed in this paper to be constant throughout the flow , and is related to the polytropic index @xmath13 by @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 is related to the specific entropy of the flow . since we ignore dissipation , the specific angular momentum @xmath16 is constant everywhere . in c89 and c90 , the steady solutions were classified according to the conserved flow parameters : the specific energy @xmath17 and the specific angular momentum @xmath18 . at the outer boundary , where matter in injected , the velocity @xmath19 is supplied and the sound speed @xmath20 is computed from @xmath17 from the dimensionless conserved energy : @xmath21 from eq . ( 2 ) , @xmath22 .",
    "we assume a fixed mach number @xmath23 at the outer boundary and @xmath24 , where , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the height and the radial distance of the injected matter at the outer boundary .",
    "the numerical simulation code is grid based using the tvd scheme , originally developed by harten ( 1983 ) .",
    "it is an explicit , second order accurate scheme which is designed to solve a hyperbolic system of the conservation equations , like the system of the hydrodynamic conservation equations .",
    "it is a nonlinear scheme obtained by first modifying the flux function and then applying a non - oscillatory first order accurate scheme to get a resulting second order accuracy . in this way we achieve the high resolution of a second order accuracy while preserving the robustness of a non - oscillatory first order scheme .",
    "the details of the code development are already in ryu et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) and are not presented here .",
    "the calculations have been done in a setting similar to that used in ryu , chakrabarti & molteni ( 1997 ) .",
    "the computational box occupies one quadrant of the @xmath27 plane with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we mimic the horizon ( @xmath30 ) by placing an absorbing boundary at a sphere of radius @xmath31 inside which all the material is completely absorbed . to begin the simulation ,",
    "we fill in the black hole surroundings with a very tenuous plasma of density @xmath32 and the temperature as that of the incoming material .",
    "the incoming gas of density @xmath33 enters the box through the outer boundary located at @xmath34 .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath35 is chosen . in the absence of self - gravity and cooling ,",
    "the density is scaled out , and thus the simulation results remain valid for accretion rate . at the outer boundary , @xmath34 and thus @xmath36 .",
    "all the calculations have been done with @xmath37 cells .",
    "thus , each grid size is @xmath38 .",
    "all the simulations are carried out assuming a stellar mass black hole ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the results remain equally valid for massive / super - massive black holes , only the time and the length are to be scaled with the central mass .",
    "we carry out the simulations till several thousands of dynamical time scales is passed . in reality",
    "this corresponds to a few seconds in physical units .",
    "in molteni et al . ( 1996 ) , we presented the simulation results where the steady state solutions from the theoretical and the numerical methods were compared .",
    "generally , the solutions were reproduced quite well and we do not repeat the tests any more .",
    "first , we run a model where the injected matter has no specific angular momentum @xmath40 . and follow the evolution .",
    "we compare the numerical solution with three models which are respectively the flow with a constant height ( ch ) , the flow with an wedge shaped cross - section ( constant angle : ca ) and the flow which is in vertical equilibrium ( ve ) .",
    "see , chakrabarti & das ( 2001 ) for the definitions of these models . here , the specific energy is chosen to be @xmath41 .",

    "theoretically , the steady shock is supposed to form at @xmath57 in vertical equilibrium model ( table 1 ) . numerically , however , we find that the flow has formed a shock , but it is oscillating around a mean location",
    ". the flow mach number jumps and becomes subsonic at around ( @xmath58 ) . however , the shock location oscillates . in some part in the post - shock region , the flow has a ` negative ' mach number . in this case , the matter actually flows outward , bouncing back from the centrifugal barrier on the equatorial plane . at around ( @xmath59 )",
    "the flow becomes supersonic and again form a relatively weaker ` inner shock ' at around ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this inner shock also oscillates .",
    "several important facts arise out of this exercise : ( a ) the inject matter behaves like a flow of constant thickness in the pre - shock region , ( b ) the mach number variation in the post - shock region is closer to that of the flow in vertical equilibrium .",
    "of course , the back - flow due to the centrifugal barrier is a major factor to influence the post - shock region .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "4 where the velocity vectors have been plotted .",
    "the back - flow diverts the matter from the post - shock region to regions away from the equatorial plane and produces jets and outflows .",

    "the density contours in the post - shock region resemble those of a thick accretion disk ( paczynski & wiita , 1980 ) , though our results are more realistic since the radial velocity is included here .",
    "the shock clearly moves around and the outflow also shows corresponding fluctuations .",
    "the density contours are for @xmath66 , where the density inside a parenthesis gives the interval and left and right numbers are ` from ' and ` to ' density values .",

    "turbulence slows down the flow and consequently , the infall time @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the grid size and @xmath69 is the local radial velocity , is longer than the free - fall time @xmath70 in the post - shock region .",
    "a detailed computation using the radial velocity averaged over @xmath71 grids in the vertical direction and using radial coordinate from the outer shock to the event horizon ) shows that the ratio @xmath72 in this case . in the pre - shock region @xmath73 .",
    "we continue our detailed investigation of the case a. in fig .",
    "6 , we show the variation of the outer ( os ) and the inner shock ( is ) locations ( dimensionless unit ) with time ( in seconds ) .",
    "the oscillating nature settles down after an initial transient phase of @xmath74 .",
    "we clearly see the presence of oscillations in both the shocks , though the amplitudes are larger for the outer shock . the outer shock location oscillates between @xmath75 to @xmath76 and the inner shock oscillates between @xmath77 to @xmath78 .    in fig .",
    "7 ( a - b ) , we present the power density spectrum ( pds ) of the time variation of the shock locations . in ( a ) and ( b ) , the pdss for the inner and the outer shock locations are shown . the outer shock shows a peak at @xmath79hz , but otherwise , both the pdss show strong peaks at @xmath80hz . in the sub - sonic flow of the post - shock region , the movement of the inner shock also perturbs the outer shock location and thus the high frequencies are the same .",
    "as will be discussed later , these oscillations can cause significant modulations of the x - ray intensity and cause the so - called qpos in black hole candidates ( molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti , 1996 ; chakrabarti , acharyya & molteni , 2004 ) .",

    "the mean outer shock location slightly increases when @xmath18 increased from @xmath84 to @xmath85 but subsequently the shock becomes turbulent pressure dominated and not centrifugal pressure dominated and the location does not change even with angular momentum .",
    "the mean inner shock location , on the contrary , shows a tendency to increase with angular momentum .",

    "the ratio @xmath88 of the infall time and the free fall time from the outer shock increases almost monotonically , which are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "we also note that for low enough angular momentum , oscillations at the inner shock influences that at the outer shock . for higher angular momentum , however , the perturbations are greatly washed out due to turbulence . as a result ,",
    "only the inner shock oscillates and qpos are produced at higher frequencies .",
    "it is important to note that both the shocks are coupled together by the flow in between . as a result ,",
    "both the shocks oscillate with higher and lower frequencies .",
    "the behaviour of the power density spectra is very interesting . in fig .",
    "10 we show the results of case d where both the pdss are superimposed .",
    "the solid curve shows the pds of the time variation of the inner shock location while the dotted curve shows the pds of that of the outer shock .",
    "it seems that the inner shock has more power at the higher frequency peak , while the outer shock has more power at the lower frequency peak . assuming that the hard x - rays are produced due to compton scattering of soft x - rays by hot electrons in the post - shock region",
    ", this would mean that the hard x - rays will also modulate with high and low frequencies .",
    "the radiation from the post-(outer)shock region would participate in the quasi - periodic oscillations in the lower frequency and the radiation from the relatively small post-(inner)shock region would participate in the high frequency oscillation .    , ( b ) @xmath85 , ( c ) @xmath93 and ( d ) @xmath83 .",

    "the oscillation frequencies are ( a ) @xmath96 , ( b ) @xmath97 , ( c ) @xmath98 and ( d ) @xmath99hz respectively . ]",
    "we turn our attention to the behaviour of the oscillating shocks where the specific energy of the flow is changed while the specific angular momentum is kept fixed .",
    "the results we show are those of cases ( c - f ) in table 1 . in figs .",

    "12(a - d ) we show the variation of the inner shock location .",
    "we assume @xmath100 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 were used .",
    "since the shocks are primarily centrifugal barrier supported , the locations of the shocks remain at similar distances , though , we see a small increase in the mean shock ( both the inner and the outer ) locations with specific energy .",

    "in this paper , we presented the results of two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of matter accreting on to a black hole .",
    "we systematically chose the flow parameters ( @xmath50 ) from the parameter space which provides complete set of solutions of a black hole accretion flow .",
    "the parameter space was classified into regions which may or may not produce standing shocks ( c89 , c90 ) in an inviscid flow .",
    "the classifications were made using three different models of the flow , namely , a disk of constant thickness , a disk with conical wedge cross - section and a disk which is in vertical equilibrium ( chakrabarti & das , 2001 ) . our motivation was to study whether a simulated result behaves like a theoretical model throughout .",
    "we observed that the flow behaved like that of constant thickness before the shock .",
    "however , in the post - shock region , as the flow expands vertically due to higher thermal pressure , it behaved like that of a flow in vertical equilibrium .",
    "second , the infall time in the post - shock region is several times larger as compared to the free - fall time , especially due to the formation of turbulence in the post - shock region .",
    "third , instead of only one possible shock transition , the flow shows the formation of two shocks , one very close to the black hole ( @xmath123 ) and the other farther away depending on the angular momentum .",
    "both the shocks showed significant oscillations . while the inner shock oscillated faster than the outer shock",
    ", each of them also oscillated at the frequency of the other , though at a lesser power .",
    "these oscillations or their variants are long thought to cause the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in black hole intensity ( molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti , 1996 ; chakrabarti , acharyya & molteni , 2004 ) .",
    "it is possible that not only the intermediate and low frequency qpos are explained by this process , the high frequency qpos may also be explained by the oscillations of the inner shock and the inner sonic point .",
    "however , since the volume of matter , participating in the inner shock oscillation is very small , the modulation at a high frequency would be negligible .",
    "we also observed that the outflows form from the post - shock region .",
    "the rates are specially high , and vary episodically .",
    "the amplitude and frequency of variation of the outflow rate is dictated by the amplitudes and frequencies of the two shocks .",
    "the outflow can be anywhere between @xmath124 to @xmath125 percent of the inflow rate , provided the flow is sub - keplerian . since the keplerian flows are sub - sonic , and therefore , strictly speaking no shocks , the outflows are not possible from a keplerian disk in this model .",
