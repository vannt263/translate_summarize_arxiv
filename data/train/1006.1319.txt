    "gauge symmetry is no doubt the underlying principle of contemporary particle theory .",
    "it is a mathematical or geometrical input rather than a dynamical consequence .",
    "however , some people wonder if there is any physical or dynamical reason that necessitates gauge symmetry@xcite . aside from such attempts ,",
    "one suggestion was made decades ago@xcite that when spin - one bosons are generated as tightly bound composite particles their couplings obey gauge invariance in the limit of vanishing mass .",
    "this was indeed demonstrated in a solvable model with fermions as constituents@xcite . as in most other attempts ,",
    "the model was based on the lagrangian of the nambu - jona - lasinio type with a vector coupling and was , therefore , unrenormalizable , which is the price to pay for solvability .",
    "the conclusion was that all gauge - symmetry breakings as well as unrenormalizability are transformed into the mass of the composite spin - one bosons and that the composite boson mass can be made as small as one likes , but never zero , by making the binding force stronger , that is , infinitely close to gauge bosons but not exactly .",
    "failure to realize genuine gauge invariance is obvious since the lagrangian written in the fields of fermion constituents explicitly violates gauge invariance ; perfect gauge symmetry should not arise where underlying dynamics explicitly violates it .",
    "nonetheless , it is remarkable that gauge noninvariance is entirely transformed into the composite boson mass term .",
    "the gauge boson sector of the electroweak model without a higgs boson was built by the present author@xcite along this line twenty years ago incorporating the proposal of bjorken@xcite and of hung and sakurai@xcite .",
    "consistency of the large @xmath0 expansion as an effective low - energy field theory was analyzed for this model by cohen , georgi , and simmons@xcite , who also suggested how to incorporate quarks and leptons in this heretic electroweak model .",
    "it was immediately after production of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons were confirmed at cern for the first time . since then",
    ", precision of the experimental measurement on the electroweak interaction has risen to test the standard model at the level of the loop corrections .",
    "consequently , the phenomenological models of the late 1980 s are no longer viable , but other options may still exist . until we see an outcome of the large hadron collider experiment ,",
    "we should be prepared for possible surprises and leave all options open for phenomenology . it should be emphasized , however , that the purpose of the present paper is not to build a phenomenologically viable alternative to the standard electroweak theory , but to obtain a better understanding of the generation mechanism of approximate gauge invariance .",
    "even if this mechanism may not turn out to be of use to model building in near future , it is an interesting theoretical subject of discussion in field theory .",
    "we shall find in this paper that the dynamical generation of approximate gauge symmetry is not an accident in the nambu - jona - lasinio model or special to the fermionic constituents .",
    "a natural question arises as to how general this phenomenon is and which inputs are really necessary for this phenomenon to occur .",
    "the present paper first investigates the original fermionic constituent model by a different method and then moves on to explore how the approximate gauge symmetries are generated in the case of bosonic constituents , if at all . after studying the bosonic case , we understand the generation mechanism better and feel more confident that the mechanism is quite general and independent of specific models .",
    "it may appear that our study has some technical resemblance with the phenomenon known as hidden symmetry , the name coined by bando , kugo , and yamawaki@xcite .",
    "however , the hidden symmetry is something that is built in a theory at the beginning in one way or another . in contrast",
    ", we are concerned with the dynamics in which a relevant local symmetry does not exist , hidden or otherwise , at the fundamental level , but emerges only as an approximate symmetry in the low - energy effective lagrangian . in our case the local symmetry is explicitly broken at all levels .",
    "we study how the explicit breakings of local symmetries transform into the lagrangian of composite vector bosons .",
    "our study focuses on a different subject , technically and conceptually , as we shall later comment more .",
    "we start with a short summary of the results from an earlier paper@xcite .",
    "let us think of forming tightly bound vector bosons out of fermions with heavy mass @xmath3 .",
    "we choose that the fermions transform like the fundamental representation of su(n ) , which we refer to as the `` flavor group '' .",
    "the flavor group may be any other group . in order to solve field theory explicitly",
    ", we choose the lagrangian of the nambu - jona - lasinio - type model with @xmath0 families of fermions and make the large @xmath0 expansion .    in reasonably short - handed notations ,",
    "the lagrangian is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are the generators of the flavor su(n ) in the @xmath7 matrices , and the currents @xmath8 ( @xmath6 ) are singlets of the u(n ) family symmetry .",
    "the summation over flavor and family indices has been entirely suppressed in the kinetic energy and mass term . while this lagrangian is symmetric under the global su(n)@xmath9u(n ) symmetry , it is obviously not invariant under gauge rotations of su(n ) or u(n ) on @xmath10 .",
    "when the coupling constant @xmath11 is positive and larger than some critical value , the interaction generates vector bound states of a family singlet that form the adjoint representation of the flavor su(n ) . in the leading @xmath0 order , explicit computation of the infinite fermion chain in fig .",
    "1 allows us to obtain for the bound states not only the mass and the coupling to the fermions but also the triple and quartic self - couplings@xcite .",
    "although quadratic divergence does not appear in the loop diagrams thanks to global current conservation , logarithmic divergences do . we regularize them by the dimensional regularization .",
    "the result is remarkable : all the couplings of the composite vector bosons obey su(n ) gauge invariance .",
    "the effective lagrangian written in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 reads in the standard notation @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the su(n ) adjoint vector fields in an @xmath7 matrix and @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the gauge coupling constant @xmath17 and the boson mass are obtained from the loop diagram as @xmath18 where @xmath19 in the dimensional regularization .",
    "it is only the mass term of the composite vector - boson fields @xmath15 that is not gauge invariant in the effective lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the four - fermion interactions of the original lagrangian of the constituent fermions disappear from @xmath20 , i.e. , nonrenormalizability of the current - current interaction is also transferred entirely into this composite boson mass term .    the composite boson mass squared @xmath21 can be made as small as one likes by increasing the magnitude of the coupling of binding @xmath11 , but it can never reach zero for any finite value of @xmath11 . this is because each loop of the fermion self - energy chain is of the transverse form @xmath22 with @xmath23 by the global current conservation of su(n ) symmetry and consequently iteration of the loops leads to the fermion - antifermion scattering amplitude of the form , @xmath24 since @xmath25 with @xmath26 near @xmath27 , the location of the bound - state pole determined by @xmath28 is at @xmath29 .",
    "notice the importance of @xmath23 in order to have @xmath30 .",
    "this can not be realized without global su(n ) current conservation . for bound states other than spin - parity @xmath31 ,",
    "the natural scale of mass squared is @xmath32 or else @xmath33 ( @xmath34 = momentum cutoff ) .",
    "furthermore we should appreciate that the same global current conservation prevents us from bringing the vector bound - state pole to @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the general theorem@xcite by case - gasiorowicz and weinberg - witten that asserts incompatibility of the charged _ massless _ vector bosons with the lorentz - covariant conserved currents carrying nonvanishing charges . putting it more",
    "simply , a massless spin - one boson can not be obtained in the continuous limit of a massive spin - one boson , as we all know .",
    "if we took literally the limit of @xmath35 , the mass @xmath21 would become zero , i.e. , the composite bosons would look like gauge bosons . in this limit",
    "the entire lagrangian would become @xmath36 alone after rescaling of the fields and therefore trivially gauge invariant .",
    "however , the global currents would not exist by the noether theorem in this pathological gauge - invariant limit .",
    "conflict with the theorem could be thus evaded , but this limit is a case of no interest , physically or mathematically .",
    "how can these gauge - invariant couplings be generated ?",
    "it is easy to understand when one works in the functional integral method@xcite .",
    "the partition function @xmath2 in terms of the @xmath37 fields is given in the euclidean metric by @xmath38 we can replace the current - current interaction by introducing the auxiliary adjoint vector fields @xmath39 as @xmath40 where the added lagrangian term @xmath41 is defined in the minkowski metric by @xmath42 summation over the flavor @xmath43 is understood above and in the following .",

    "( [ af ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) is obvious since one can trivially integrate out the fields @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) after shifting @xmath15 in the functional space .",
    "when we open up @xmath44 and add it to @xmath45 , the current - current interactions cancel out between @xmath45 and @xmath41 , leaving the effective lagrangian @xmath46 in the minkowski metric in the form of @xmath47 the constant in front of @xmath48 should be identified with the gauge coupling @xmath17 so that @xmath49 the functional integration over @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) is equivalent to rewriting the current - current interaction with the @xmath15 exchange at zero - momentum transfer .",
    "this explains the relation in eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) as @xmath50 . while the diagram calculation has determined @xmath51 and @xmath21 individually as given in eq .",
    "( [ gm ] ) , the mass @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ lfa ] ) is still a free parameter .",
    "the reason is that we have not yet incorporated the dynamical information of the fermion loop at this stage of the functional integral formulation .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath52 has no kinetic energy term of @xmath15 so that its equation of motion for @xmath12 reads @xmath53 it simply means that , before letting the vector - bosons propagate , they are made of fermion - antifermion pairs .",
    "the global current conservation @xmath54 assures that the composite fields @xmath55 consist only of spin - one states by @xmath56 leaving out the o(3 ) scalar component at this stage .",
    "we can now proceed to generate the kinetic energy term and the self - couplings of dimension four for @xmath15 from the loop diagrams . with @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ lfa ] ) , iteration of the fermion loops no longer occurs for the two - point function of @xmath15 since there is no four - fermion interaction left in @xmath46 .",
    "the relevant diagrams are only the single fermion - loop diagrams of @xmath15 in the leading order of @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true for the three and four - point functions .",
    "we should notice here that @xmath20 is gauge invariant up to the mass term of @xmath15 since the interaction @xmath57 can be combined with the fermion kinetic energy term into the gauge - invariant form ; @xmath58 the painstaking diagram calculation@xcite for the two , three and four - point functions of @xmath15 was actually unnecessary ; they must come out in the gauge - invariant combination up to the overall constant since the sole term of gauge noninvariance , namely , the vector - meson mass term @xmath59 , does not enter the loop calculation in the leading @xmath0 order",
    ". therefore the radiatively produced lagrangian of dimension four for the fields @xmath15 ought to be in the form @xmath60 an explicit loop - diagram calculation is needed only to obtain the constant @xmath61 . the fermion loop of fig .",

    "( [ renorm ] ) .",

    ", we summarize this section : in the explicitly solvable model of fermionic constituents a set of composite spin - one bosons behave exactly like gauge bosons in the small limit of the composite boson mass even though the fundamental lagrangian is explicitly gauge noninvariant .",
    "gauge noninvariance stays but solely in the mass term of the composite bosons .",
    "since the origin of the boson mass is not spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry , there is no asymmetric vacuum condensate of a scalar field , elementary nor composite .",
    "a hidden symmetry can be introduced in the fermionic model of the nambu - jona - lasinio type , if one wishes , by using its language , but it is always broken in this case .",
    "there is no unbroken phase of the hidden symmetry except for the pathological limit of @xmath35@xcite .",
    "we have chosen the four - fermion binding force here in order to demonstrate all solutions explicitly in the cutoff field theory .",
    "rather than going into a discussion of phenomenological relevance , we explore in the succeeding sections whether this remarkable phenomenon of dynamical gauge - symmetry generation is realized in other models or not , specifically , in the case that the constituents are spinless bosons .",
    "the option of bosons being fundamental particles is even more esoteric phenomenologically and sounds less attractive .",
    "our purpose here is , however , to obtain a better understanding of this generation mechanism of an approximate gauge symmetry from other models .",
    "we would like to see whether the gauge - symmetry generation of the preceding section works in the bosonic constituent models or not .",
    "we emphasize that we do not slip an unbroken local symmetry in our models to look for massless vector bosons as dynamical gauge boson modes .",
    "such a study was done in the @xmath69 a few decades ago ; a local symmetry is present at the beginning as redundancy when its lagrangian is written in some form , then a composite massless vector boson is searched for .",
    "instead we choose models in which there is no local symmetry to start with .",
    "we study whether the explicit breaking can be transformed into the mass term alone in the case of tightly bound vector bosons . unlike the fermionic model , to our knowledge",
    ", our bosonic models have never been studied in the literature .",
    "they show us more clearly what realizes an approximate gauge symmetry as a consequence of compositeness .",
    "let us first study the case of an abelian vector boson since it gives us a good insight into the problem leaving out unnecessary complications .",
    "we form a neutral composite vector boson ( a massive photon ) with charged spinless bosons like @xmath70 having heavy mass @xmath3 .",
