    "we thank michael peskin and eva silverstein for discussions . our work is supported by the department of energy under contract de - ac03 - 76sf00515 .",
    "in this appendix we formalize the conclusions regarding the trapping massless electric or magnetic photons in the theory where a @xmath8 gauge field is higgsed away from @xmath9 but is unbroken inside @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider formally the limit where @xmath97 , so that the photon outside is really infinitely heavy .",
    "the @xmath8 then really only exists inside @xmath9 ; with a lagrangian given by = d^3 x _ -l/2^l/2",
    "dz f^ f_. this just looks like the compactification of a @xmath8 gauge theory from @xmath98 dimensions on an interval of length @xmath11 .",
    "however , the spectrum of the theory at energies beneath the compactification scale @xmath16 depends crucially on the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath99 at @xmath100 .",
    "this is because massless states in the low energy theory must be zero modes in the @xmath101 direction , and are therefore sensitive to the boundary conditions , which may or may not eliminate them . in the present case , the region outside the wall is superconducting , so the appropriate boundary conditions are that the electric field is perpendicular to the wall ( true for any conductor ) and that the magnetic field is parallel to the wall ( which is only true for a superconductor ) ; that is e_x = e_y=0,b_z=0 which can be written more covariantly as f^ab = 0 , a , b = t , x , y .",
    "this makes it clear that a massless photon coupling to electric charge is not present in the low energy theory , it is projected out of the usual kaluza - klein spectrum by the boundary conditions .",
    "the usual kk scalar , corresponding to @xmath102 , remains in the massless spectrum , but does not couple to electric charge .",
    "rather , a massless magnetic photon has been trapped .",
    "indeed , the boundary conditions can also be written as ^a3 = 0 which leaves the zero mode of @xmath103 in the massless spectrum .",
    "this of course works because in @xmath6 dimensions , a scalar is dual to a vector field .    of course in both cases",
    ", we also have a tower of massive states .",
    "this follows from the standard kaluza - klein analysis with the boundary conditions appropriately imposed .",
    "but we can also see it in another way .",
    "let us generalize to the case of an @xmath104 dimensional wall of thickness @xmath11 in an @xmath105 dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath106 be the @xmath104-dimensional coordinates , and @xmath107 the @xmath105th coordinate .",
    "placing an electric charge at the origin , let us compute the electric potential at the point @xmath108 on the wall .",
    "we can enforce the boundary conditions by placing an infinite sequence of image charges of charge @xmath109 at @xmath110 .",
    "the potential is then v(x ) = _ q = -^+ [ pot ] where we have used the expression for the @xmath111 dimensional coulomb potential in terms of its fourier transform .",
    "if we now use the familiar poisson resummation identity _",
    "q=-^ e^i q = 2 _ s = -^ ( - 2 s ) we can perform the integral over @xmath112 , leaving v(x ) = _ s = -^ . note that the integrand is just the @xmath104-dimensional yukawa potential for a field of mass @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the potential can be expressed in terms of a sum over a tower of @xmath104 dimensional massive states .",
    "if we instead place a magnetic charge at the origin , an infinite sequence of magnetic image charges of the _ same _ sign enforce the boundary condition , and the @xmath114 term in eqn.([pot ] ) disappears .",
    "therefore , the potential is due to a sum over @xmath104 dimensional massive fields of mass @xmath115 , which for @xmath116 includes the massless magnetic photon we expect in this case .",

    "<S> .6 in    recently , dvali and shifman have considered the possibility of trapping gauge fields on @xmath1-branes with @xmath2 using confining dynamics in a bulk 3 + 1-dimensional gauge theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these field theoretic branes are very interesting as their higher dimensional generalizations can be used to construct extensions of the standard model with extra dimensions . in such models gravity and possibly some other fields propagate in higher dimensional space - time whereas the standard model matter and gauge forces are confined to ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional branes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from these potential phenomenological applications field theoretic @xmath1-branes also provide a very interesting background for studying the interplay of dynamics in various dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly intrigued by some obvious similarities between these branes and d - branes @xcite in string theory : apart from supporting a gauge field in their world - volume , field theoretic branes also allow color flux - strings to end on them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to further explore the analogy between these branes in field theory and in string theory . more concretely , after reviewing the construction of dvali and shifman and giving some simple generalizations , we consider what happens when @xmath0 of these walls are brought on top of each other . from the analogy with d - branes one </S>",
    "<S> expects that modes of the qcd flux - string become light and contribute to the effective @xmath1 dimensional world - volume field theory . in the case of d - branes the lightest modes are spin-1 fields ( and their superpartners ) , and the @xmath3 gauge symmetry of @xmath0 widely separated d - branes gets enhanced to @xmath4 . in the case of the qcd string the masses of low - lying vibrational modes decrease as [ mass ] m l  ^2 when the length @xmath5 of a long flux tube is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> however which modes of the qcd string become light for small @xmath5 turns out to be different . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue from consistency of the @xmath6 dimensional low energy field theory on the branes that the lightest such mode is not a spin-1 field . </S>",
    "<S> instead we find a scalar whose mass squared is positive for long stretched strings but becomes negative for very small @xmath7 where eq.[mass ] breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> thus for very small separation the scalar condenses and _ reduces _ the gauge symmetry of the effective field theory on the branes . </S>",
    "<S> this understanding of the reduction of gauge symmetry as branes are brought in contact with each other from both a macroscopic effective ( 2 + 1)-d theory as well as from a microscopic ( 3 + 1)-d picture with qcd strings is our central result . as a bonus </S>",
    "<S> we also find that field theoretic branes can be connected by multi - pronged flux tubes corresponding to `` baryonic '' qcd strings .    </S>",
    "<S> to get started we first review the argument of dvali and shifman @xcite and give a simple generalization before moving on to consider what happens when @xmath0 of these walls are brought on top of each other .    in the construction of our walls </S>",
    "<S> we will frequently assume that a gauge group is broken in some region of space but not in others . </S>",
    "<S> we will also have use for matter fields which are very massive in the bulk but light on the walls . in the discussion </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that these effects have been arranged by coupling the theory to a `` black box '' containing appropriate very massive neutral and charged scalars with space dependent vacuum expectation values .    for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we first attempt to localize a @xmath8 gauge field to a region @xmath9 in 3 + 1 dimensional space between @xmath10 , which on distances much larger than @xmath11 would look like a 2 + 1 dimensional wall supporting a @xmath8 gauge field .    the most obvious idea is to arrange for the @xmath8 to be broken outside @xmath9 giving the photon a mass @xmath12 , but unbroken inside @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> then , since the photon is massive outside @xmath9 but massless inside , one may think that there is a massless electric photon in the @xmath6-d theory at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case . to understand this , note that the region outside @xmath9 is superconducting while the region inside is normal vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> now place an electric test charge inside @xmath9 and examine the field strength at another point in @xmath9 a distance @xmath13 away ; if there is a massless photon in the long - distance theory , we should have a @xmath6-d coulomb field in this regime .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.9 in    since the region outside is a conductor , however , the electric field lines emanating from the test charge must end on and be perpendicular to the boundary of @xmath9 , whereas in order to obtain a @xmath14 dimensional force law these field lines would have to be repelled from the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we can solve for the electric field using the method of images , with an infinite number of image charges of alternating signs . </S>",
    "<S> clearly all the multipole moments vanish for such a configuration , and we are left with an exponentially small field for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that there are no fields lighter than the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 of the ( 2 + 1)-d theory , coupling to electric charge . </S>",
    "<S> it is very easy to see ( as we show in detail in the appendix ) that instead , there is a tower of _ massive _ gauge fields with masses quantized in units of @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> this failure suggests the correct way to proceed , however . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we instead place a magnetic charge @xmath17 inside @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> now , because of the meissner effect in the superconducting region , all the magnetic flux lines are repelled from the boundaries and we recover the @xmath6-d magnetic coulomb law . a trivial application of gauss law yields the relationship between the effective @xmath6-d magnetic charge @xmath18 and @xmath17 : = l    of course </S>",
    "<S> , we actually want to localize electric photons on the wall , this can be accomplished by the  t hooft - mandelstam dual of this superconducting picture . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that we begin with a @xmath19 @xmath20 gauge theory , which is broken to a @xmath8 inside @xmath21 by a very massive scalar in the adjoint representation of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk theory is confining at the scale @xmath22 which we take to be @xmath23 , whereas the the @xmath8 inside @xmath9 is free . </S>",
    "<S> if we now place an electric test charge inside @xmath21 , confinement expels the electric field lines from the bulk due to the dual meissner effect , and we recover the @xmath6-d coulomb law for the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this successfully localizes a @xmath8 gauge field to a @xmath6-d wall in a @xmath24-d bulk .    </S>",
    "<S> there are obvious generalizations of this idea . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we have an @xmath25 gauge theory with @xmath26 flavors , which are given a very large mass outside @xmath9 but are massless inside . </S>",
    "<S> then the outside theory is asymptotically free and confines . </S>",
    "<S> the theory inside the region @xmath27 is infrared free at distances short compared to the wall thickness @xmath11 where the coupling evolves according to the @xmath24-d renormalization group equation . </S>",
    "<S> but at length scales long compared to @xmath11 the theory on the wall is @xmath6-dimensional and the coupling evolves according to the @xmath6-d renormalization group equation . at the uv cutoff @xmath16 of the low energy theory the ( 2 + 1)-d gauge coupling </S>",
    "<S> is matched to the higher dimensional coupling as g^2_3(= l^-1 ) = by the same argument as for the @xmath8 case above , this localizes an @xmath25 gauge theory on the @xmath6 dimensional wall . </S>",
    "<S> notice that unlike the @xmath8 case , this ( 2 + 1)-d theory also confines ; however the confinement scale is @xmath28 which can be much smaller than the cutoff @xmath16 if @xmath29 is small . </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to arrange since the 3 + 1-d theory inside @xmath9 can have a small gauge coupling at its uv cutoff and gets ( logarithmically ) weaker as it is scaled into the ir towards @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a range of energies @xmath31 where we can have an unconfined ( 2 + 1)-d @xmath25 gauge theory . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to engineer a large variety of field theoretic branes with different gauge theories living on them .    what happens if we move an electric charge from the wall into the confining bulk @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> the confinement tries to expel the electric field lines , but since a net flux of electric field must be present at large distances by gauss law , a string of electric flux forms between the charge in the bulk and the wall as in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these walls have a second qualitative feature in common with d - branes : strings can end on them . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric qcd @xcite . for a recent discussion of domain walls in softly broken @xmath32 susy gauge theories , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> = 2.in    </S>",
    "<S> we now explore this analogy with d - branes further by considering what happens when we bring two or more of these walls close together . </S>",
    "<S> for concreteness , let us take a case with @xmath20 higgsed to a @xmath8 in two regions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the case where the walls are very well separated @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then at distances longer than @xmath36 we have two @xmath6-d walls with two separate @xmath37 localized on them . </S>",
    "<S> to see that there are really two @xmath37 , simply note that the electric field lines emanating from a charge on @xmath38 can never end on a charge in @xmath39 because of the confining region separating them . </S>",
    "<S> let us further simplify our description by working in the effective theory at distances @xmath40 , where the separation between the walls can not be discerned . </S>",
    "<S> this is then a @xmath41d theory with a @xmath42 gauge group . for the case of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> well - separated walls , this very long distance theory has a @xmath3 gauge symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> next consider the opposite extreme when two walls are sitting very close to each other @xmath43 . at long distances </S>",
    "<S> this case is indistinguishable from having just one wall with thickness @xmath44 , and we only localize a single @xmath8 gauge field in the very long distance theory . therefore , as the walls are brought close together , the long - distance theory sees a @xmath45 of the gauge symmetry from @xmath42 to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this is opposite to the d - brane case , where the gauge symmetry gets enhanced from @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as we will see below , the physics of the two situations is very similar .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first try to understand what is going on purely in the long - distance theory . </S>",
    "<S> as the parameter @xmath47 in the theory is varied , we go from having a @xmath42 symmetry for @xmath48 to just a @xmath8 symmetry for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible interpretation is that the @xmath42 symmetry is higgsed somewhere in the transition where @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> since neither of the walls is special , we expect that @xmath42 must be broken to the diagonal @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this satisfies an interesting consistency check . from the microscopic viewpoint , </S>",
    "<S> when the walls merge to give a new wall of thickness @xmath44 , the ( 2 + 1)-d coupling of the single @xmath8 should be = on the other hand , the gauge coupling determined by higgsing @xmath51 to the diagonal subgroup is = + = + as required .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , purely from considerations of the very low - energy theory , we conclude that some new state becomes light when @xmath50 , and acquires a condensate to spontaneously break @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the condensate must of course be a lorentz scalar , and must be charged under both @xmath37 to break to the diagonal subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest possibility is that as @xmath47 is reduced and becomes smaller than @xmath53 a scalar field @xmath54 of charge @xmath55 under @xmath56 becomes light and then tachyonic , triggering the non - zero condensate @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the existence of such a condensate was deduced by the requirement of a consistent low - energy effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> but we can easily identify a natural candidate for @xmath54 in the microscopic theory . for @xmath58 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a stable configuration corresponding to the qcd string stretching between the walls as shown in figure 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.in    one can imagine forming this string as follows . </S>",
    "<S> place very heavy test quarks @xmath59 inside the confining medium between the walls ; a qcd string of confined color electric flux will stretch between them . </S>",
    "<S> now , move @xmath60 until it is just inside region @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this will cost a great deal of energy @xmath62 , but the resulting string is stable : it can not break since there are no dynamical quark states to pop out of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath59 are inside their respective walls , they are no longer in a confining medium and can be moved off to large distances .- </S>",
    "<S> dimensional theory is itself confining at much longer distances , the energy to move @xmath59 to infinity diverges logarithmically in the ir . ] </S>",
    "<S> the resulting configuration is just a flux tube with field lines coming in from infinity on @xmath38 , through the tube and back out to infinity on @xmath39 ( see figure 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that an observer on @xmath38 sees this as a state of charge @xmath63 under @xmath64 , while his friend on @xmath39 measures this same state to have charge @xmath65 under @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus at least for @xmath67 , we have identified a stable state @xmath54 , the lowest scalar vibrational mode of the qcd string stretching between the walls , with the quantum numbers we are after . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is clear that for large @xmath47 the mass of this mode decreases as @xmath68 as the walls are brought closer . </S>",
    "<S> it is now tempting to speculate that as the walls come very close together , this state gets lighter and lighter until it becomes tachyonic somewhere around @xmath50 and condenses . in other words , we imagine that the mass for @xmath69 as a function of @xmath47 has the form m^2_(d ) = - c_0 ^2 + c_1 ( ^2 d)^2 where @xmath70 are @xmath71 constants . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution proportional to @xmath72 has a classical origin and dominates when the string is long , while the first term reflects a ( presumably quantum - mechanical ) tachyonic instability of the unstretched qcd string . </S>",
    "<S> of course , since the flux tube has a thickness @xmath73 , in the interesting region it is as long as it is thick so a  string \" picture is necessarily heuristic . in terms of the microscopic @xmath24-d description the condensate of the tachyonic scalar can be understood as a spontaneous deconfinement transition of the qcd vacuum between the two walls due to a condensate of flux tubes .    </S>",
    "<S> it is amusing that while the end result of bringing these  branes \" together is very different from the case of bringing d - branes together , the physics has a similar interpretation : the strings stretching between the branes become light and donate their lowest excitations to the effective theory . in the case of d - branes , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - lying excitations of open strings contain gauge fields which enhance the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , our flux - strings have no massless gauge fields so there is no enhancement of gauge symmetry . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the lightest excitation that is donated is tachyonic and further breaks the gauge group ! </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting that the tachyonic instability of the qcd string here does not imply that the theory is sick and should be discarded ; it simply means that the correct vacuum , where the strings have condensed , must be chosen .    </S>",
    "<S> before we move on note that we can obtain some information about the dynamics of flux tubes by simply translating @xmath6 dimensional results into our microscopic description . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the fact that the @xmath6-d @xmath42 theory confines tells us that flux tubes in our picture are confined . </S>",
    "<S> a stable finite energy configuration is a spinning bound state of two flux tubes of opposite flux . in the case of large wall separation </S>",
    "<S> when the flux tubes are long and heavy , this is a non - relativistic bound state but as we tune the distance between the two walls such that the scalar mode @xmath54 becomes light the bound state becomes non - relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> it is amusing that these `` bound states '' of flux are spinning closed flux - strings which overlap both walls .    </S>",
    "<S> we will not discuss at length an obvious generalization to @xmath0 walls with flux tubes stretching between any pair of neighboring walls . </S>",
    "<S> these strings are charged under neighboring @xmath8 and donate the necessary scalar fields to break @xmath74 as all @xmath0 walls are merged .    instead , we can not resist the temptation to describe an interesting generalization with strings corresponding to baryons of the confined gauge theory in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> first note that the above construction of domain walls with trapped gauge fields generalizes to branes of dimension @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> to construct such a `` string '' or `` 1-brane '' consider a patch @xmath27 in the @xmath76 plane where the bulk non - abelian gauge group is broken to @xmath8 as depicted in figure 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 2.in    again , the bulk non - abelian gauge theory is chosen to confine at distances @xmath77 taken to be much shorter than the square root of the area @xmath78 of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this traps a @xmath75 dimensional @xmath8 gauge theory with gauge coupling @xmath79 on the string . </S>",
    "<S> given two such 1-branes with areas @xmath80 and associated @xmath8 gauge theories one can consider bringing the two 1-branes in contact . </S>",
    "<S> again , the low energy theory sees a reduction of the gauge group from @xmath81 to @xmath82 with the interpretation of higgsing of the gauge group via a scalar which becomes light and tachyonic as the two regions are brought within distances of order @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for this interpretation is the matching of @xmath8 couplings which in this case reads = = + = +  . just as in the case of domain walls </S>",
    "<S> a qcd string connecting @xmath83 with @xmath84 has the correct quantum numbers to supply this scalar .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now a situation with a confining gauge group @xmath85 in the bulk and @xmath0 patches with roughly equal areas @xmath86 for @xmath87 on which the running of the @xmath85 coupling has been slowed down . </S>",
    "<S> ( for example , this could be arranged by adding matter fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath85 which have very large masses in the bulk but are light on the 1-branes . ) </S>",
    "<S> then the four dimensional gauge coupling remains small on the @xmath0 patches , and below the matching scale @xmath88 the long distance physics is described by a @xmath75 dimensional @xmath89 gauge theory . as before we can create flux tubes connecting any pair of the various 1-branes by placing a pair of heavy test quarks @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the confined bulk , pulling them apart to form a flux string and then moving the two quarks in two separate regions @xmath86 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of the test quarks we are left with a flux tube which transforms in the fundamental representation of @xmath93 and an antifundamental of @xmath94 .    what happens if we start with @xmath0 test quarks in a color singlet state corresponding to a baryon of the @xmath85 bulk gauge group ? </S>",
    "<S> we can now move each of the test quarks into a different one of the patches @xmath86 ; the flux tubes from each of these quarks meet at a common junction in the bulk where @xmath0 units of flux combine into a color singlet . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of the test quarks we are left with a baryonic @xmath0-pronged flux tube connecting the @xmath0 regions as in figure 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 2.in    </S>",
    "<S> this baryonic string is stable and has a mass of order @xmath95 times the characteristic distance between the various patches . in the low energy </S>",
    "<S> effective @xmath89 theory its lowest vibrational mode would be described by a massive field which transforms in the fundamental representation of each of the @xmath85 s . </S>",
