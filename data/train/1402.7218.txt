    "since the isolation of monolayer graphene almost a decade ago  @xcite , there has been a high interest in the low energy transport and optical properties of not only the monolayer  @xcite but also a few layer graphene systems .",
    "@xcite these properties are determined by the electronic band structure near the @xmath0 point .",
    "the undoped monolayer graphene ( mlg ) is characterized by the universal optical conductivity , @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the transmittance depends solely on the fine structure constant and originates the quantized visible opacity of suspended monolayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "as far as doped graphene is concerned , there are several effects that arise in the optical properties , related to the restrictions introduced on the interband transitions by the state filling and also to the onset of intraband transitions  @xcite . the latter correspond to plasmons and give rise to the interesting and promising field of graphene plasmonics  @xcite .",
    "graphene multilayers offer a new ingredient to the interesting physics and potential applications .",
    "the relatively weak interlayer coupling , on the one hand , implies that they should inherit some properties of the parent material  @xcite , on the other hand , it introduces a new energy scale , of the order of few tenths of the electron - volt , that should yield some new properties .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that there is also a universal optical conductivity in a undoped @xmath2-layer graphene , equal to @xmath3 , that is reached in undoped graphene in the low frequency limit . at the same time , the optical response of doped bilayer graphene reveals intense strongly doping - dependent features in the mid - infrared ( around 0.4  ev )  @xcite .",
    "the origin of these experimentally observed features has been considered theoretically in these works and also , in more detail , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the band structure and the optical conductivity of bilayer graphene were calculated .",
    "some novel plasmonic effects in bernal - stacked bilayer graphene were predicted in the recent work  @xcite . as the number of layers increases beyond @xmath4 , the band structure and",
    "the optical conductivity become dependent not only on @xmath2 but also upon the stacking arrangement .",
    "there are three distinct planar projections of the honeycomb lattice ( usually denoted a , b and c ) and , consequently , @xmath5 distinct @xmath6layer sequences  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the stacking of three layers in a graphene trilayer can be either aba ( also called bernal - type ) and abc ( rhombohedral )  @xcite .",
    "these two different stacking arrangements lead to strikingly different electronic band strucures  @xcite . for instance , it was found that undoped graphene abc trilayer shows many - body correlations with an energy gap , while the bernal - type stacking ( taking place in graphite ) does not lead to a gap  @xcite .",
    "non - bernal stacked multiple graphene layers have attracted a considerable attention related to the prospect of further enhancement of capabilities of graphene - based optoelectronic devices , in particular , thz and ir photodiodes  @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity of abc trilayers has been considered in a number of works  @xcite , in particular , the effect of doping has been analysed  @xcite .",
    "even though trilayer graphene contains , on average , regions of abc and aba stacking in an 15:85 ratio  @xcite , apparently the optoelectronic properties of the latter attracted less attention and we are aware of only one work  @xcite devoted to this topic .",
    "this is notwithstanding the possibility of using far - infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy , along with the common raman scattering technique  @xcite in order to distinguish different trilayer graphene species  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this article is to analyse the spectral characteristics of the optical conductivity of intrinsic and doped aba stacked trilayers .",
    "the mirror - symmetric bernal stacking is the most common in graphene multilayers that can be exfoliated from natural graphite since it shares its crystalline structure  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , one can expect that the electrons in aba trilayers can have a monolayer- or bilayer - like character  @xcite .",
    "we shall present the analytical dispersion relation for the electrons near the dirac point , from which it follows that the band structure of the aba trilayer indeed looks like a superposition of those characteristic of a monolayer and a bilayer , although the latter corrseponds to an effective interlayer hopping constant @xmath7 times larger than the true one .",
    "based on this band structure , we calculate both the interband and intraband ( drude ) contributions to the optical conductivity .",
    "the most interesting result is that the optical absorption of a doped aba trilayer is dominated by a narrow resonant peak at the frequency corresponding to this effective interlayer hopping energy ( approximately 0.56  ev ) .",
    "it is caused by the fact that the dispersion curves corresponding to two bands are nearly parallel for a considerable range of wavevectors near the dirac point .",
    "this effect sometimes is called `` band nesting ''  @xcite in order to distinguish from van hove singularities in the single - particle density of states .",
    "we will show that the intensity of this resonant absorption is approximately proportional to the fermi energy and , therefore , can be controlled by adjusting the gate voltage applied to the graphene layer .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian for non - interacting electrons in the aba stacked trilayer involves three a - type and three b - type sites and includes the essential in - plane ( @xmath8ev ) and interlayer hoppings ( @xmath9ev ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] . these two parameters , connecting atoms that are right on top of each other in adjacent layers , are sufficient to describe the main features of the band structure , such as the type of dispersion of the energy bands and their separation , as confirmed by recent dft calculations  @xcite .",
