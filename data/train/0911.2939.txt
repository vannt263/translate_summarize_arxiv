    "] , while the necessary  breaking and the generation of masses for the exotic fermions is achieved by introducing three pairs of vector - like sm singlets from two pairs of @xmath57 .",
    "the spectrum of exotics is rather complicated in model i. in contrast , in model ii we add the minimal number of exotic particles with rational @xmath0 charges to cancel the @xmath0 anomalies .",
    "this model has the minimal exotic particle content but does not respect the simplest form of gauge coupling unification .",
    "we present the general superpotential and the supersymmetry breaking soft terms for both models .    for concreteness",
    ", we will work in model i ( the @xmath1 embedding ) .",
    "first , we discuss the one - loop effective potential at finite temperature in the t  hooft - landau gauge in the @xmath59-scheme .",
    "we calculate the gauge boson , higgs , neutralino , chargino , squark , and slepton mass matrices , and those for the scalar components of the exotic chiral superfields .",
    "we also calculate the temperature dependent masses for the higgs fields , the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons , squarks , sleptons , and the scalar components of the exotic chiral superfields .",
    "there are two relevant phase transitions as the temperature decreases : the  symmetry is broken at about 1 tev , and the ew symmetry at the weak scale .",
    "we show that there exists strong enough first order ewpt because of the large trilinear term @xmath39 in the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "thus , unlike the mssm , the stop masses can be very heavy compared to the top quark mass .",
    "the ewpt features in model ii or the other possible anomaly - free embeddings are similar , because the exotic particles contributions to the one - loop effective potential at finite temperature are suppressed by their heavy masses .",
    "subsequently , we discuss possible @xmath2 violation introduced by the extended higgs sector of the smssm .",
    "as first pointed out in  @xcite , unlike the mssm in which there is no @xmath2-violation in the higgs sector at tree level , both explicit and spontaneous violation ( denote them as ecpv and scpv ) can occur .",
    "there are five complex parameters in the supersymmetry breaking soft terms and only four gauge - independent higgs phase degrees of freedom , which implies that one of these complex phases can not be removed by field redefinition .",
    "the @xmath2-symmetry of this tree - level potential can therefore be explicitly broken .",
    "in addition , as a result of balancing different terms in the minimization of the tree - level neutral higgs potential , the phases of the higgs fields can obtain non - trivial vevs , which implies that @xmath2 symmetry can also be spontaneously broken .",
    "with loop corrections included , there may coexist vacua at finite temperature with broken and unbroken ew symmetry .",
    "the values of the spontaneous @xmath2 phases are usually different in these vacua .    in this work scpv",
    "provides a direct source for baryogenesis , while its magnitude is mediated by an explicit phase from the secluded sector - violating sources beyond the higgs sector , e.g. , the ones from soft gaugino and sfermion masses , which are generally used for ewbg in supersymmetric models .",
    "though they may provide non - trivial contributions to ewbg , these @xmath2 phases usually suffer strong constraints from electric dipole moments . ] .",
    "these new @xmath2 sources do not introduce significant new contributions to the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron and neutron .",
    "after proper field redefinitions , the @xmath2-violation phases will only appear in the higgs mass matrix through soft masses associated with singlet components .",
    "numerical estimates show that , for typical parameter values , their contributions to edms will be about six or seven orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental upper limits .",
    "these contributions disappear completely in the limit with a trivial explicit @xmath2 phase , where the spontaneous @xmath2 phases are absent in the true vacuum but not where ewbg occurs .    in the early universe the first order ewpt",
    "is realized by nucleating bubbles of the broken phase .",
    "the dynamical properties of these bubbles , such as the wall profile and expansion velocity , can have important influences on the production of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "we also study their physics in detail .",
    "the vevs of the higgs fields ( including both their magnitudes and phases ) are space - dependent , as one crosses the bubble wall .",
    "the bubble wall thickness is estimated by minimizing the action under the kink ansatz  @xcite .",
    "numerical results show that it varies from @xmath60 to @xmath61 as an approximately monotonically increasing function of the phase changes of the higgs fields .",
    "in addition , we argue that the wall velocity in the smssm can not be larger than that in the mssm under the same phase transition condition and thus should be non - relativistic .",
    "this fact implies that ew sphaleron processes have more time to occur and hence will enhance the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "we then systematically study non - local ewbg in both the thin wall and thick wall regimes .",
    "non - local baryogenesis has a great advantage over the local one  @xcite : the baryon number violation processes take place in an effective volume extending from the wall surface to a region in the symmetric phase , and thus we may expect an enhancement in the generation of the baryon asymmetry . according to the bubble wall profile , we calculate the contribution from @xmath3 leptons in the thin wall regime , and the ones from stop , charginos and top quarks in the thick wall regime .",
    "we find that the @xmath2-violating currents induced by stops and charginos are very different from those obtained in the mssm : ( 1 ) the current of the @xmath62 type ( in our formalism , the concrete expression is a little different ) never requires @xmath63 in the bubble wall due to the variance of the relevant @xmath2 phases crossing the wall - violating current of the @xmath64 type for charginos which arises from a resummation of corrections associated with higher order higgs insertions or multiple scattering effects in the bubble wall .",
    "though not suppressed by @xmath65 , the current of this type is usually subdominant unless @xmath65 is suppressed ( in our model it is always subdominant ) . for relevant or more general discussions ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore not discuss the currents of this type . ] ; ( 2 ) there is a new type of @xmath2-violating current at the leading order which is proportional to @xmath66 with @xmath67 and is absent in the mssm .",
    "the @xmath2-violating current of the new type has important influence on the ewbg .",
    "first , the stop contribution can be quadratically enhanced by a large soft @xmath68 parameter .",
    "second , in addition to @xmath3 leptons , top squarks and charginos , top quarks can also play a significant role in the ewbg .",
    "all of these features are results of the scpv - driven ewbg , so they are not sensitive to the concrete embeddings of the smssm .",
    "numerical calculations show that the produced baryon asymmetry is large enough to explain the cosmological observation today .",
    "though the ewbg is directly driven by scpv , there is no dilution problem between matter and anti - matter bubbles .",
    "such a dilution is caused by a @xmath69 discrete symmetry which usually exists in the scpv scenarios . in our work , however , this symmetry has been explicitly broken at tree level by the explicit @xmath2-violating phase .",
    "we also study the correlation between ewbg and cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the smssm .",
    "large trilinear soft parameters ( used for strong enough first order ewpt ) more often arise from gravity - mediated susy breaking , where the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is usually the lightest neutralino .",
    "we study the possibility of describing the ewbg and neutralino cdm in the same framework .",
    "though we do not scan the whole parameter space , we find that there indeed exist some regions where strong enough first order ewpt , large @xmath2 phase variations across the bubble wall , reasonable baryon asymmetry , as well as acceptable neutralino lsp relic density can be achieved simultaneously .",
    "the relevant neutralino mass @xmath70 is close to @xmath71 . finally , we comment briefly on possible cosmological signals : superconducting cosmic strings and gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "we expect that particle emission from the decays of cosmic strings and gws from ewpt may be observed within the foreseeable future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the tree - level higgs potential in the smssm and construct two anomaly - free embeddings in section 2 .",

    "the wall velocity of a new - born bubble is mainly mediated by three kinds of forces : 1 ) the driving force ( @xmath244 ) responsible for the bubbles expansion ; 2 ) the shrinking force ( @xmath245 ) due to the surface tension of the bubbles ( @xmath246 ) ; and 3 ) the friction coming from the plasma ( @xmath247 ) . though some progress has been reported in the mssm recently  @xcite , a systematic study on the dynamics of the bubble wall is still absent in the smssm . in the following",

    "we may well expect that in the smssm the thermal pressure is not smaller than that in the mssm given @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",

    "generally , two parallel approaches are available : the semiclassical force method @xcite and spontaneous baryogenesis  @xcite . the first one is based on the fact that , under the wkb approximation ( @xmath271 ) , a @xmath2-violating mass term in the lagrangian can induce a @xmath2-violating shift in gradients of the dispersion relation at first order .",
    "this @xmath2-violating source then appears in the diffusion equations , interpreted as one kind of  semi - classical \" source .",
    "this approach has been applied to the mssm  @xcite and the non - minimal nmssm  @xcite .",

    "the second approach is a little like the one used in the thin wall regime : the @xmath2-violating source is the particle current reflected by the bubble wall , but the damping and multiple - scattering effects are included .",
    "with @xmath2-violating sources produced , the particles carrying the @xmath2-odd transport charges will undergo a diffusion process outside the bubble .",
    "dynamical baryogenesis requires a slight departure from thermal equilibrium in front of the wall , implying that not all particle `` decay '' processes ( _ i.e. _ , those which affect the charge number density ) are fast or adiabatic compared to the expanding velocity of the bubble wall .",
    "if @xmath272 with @xmath273 being the decay rate and @xmath44 the associated diffusion constant , the processes will be considered as fast , and vice versa . in our calculations , almost all processes included in the diffusion equations are fast , otherwise they will not have enough time to significantly affect the charge number density .",
    "the only exception is the ew sphaleron process .",
    "we assume that they are slow during the diffusion and can be neglected in mediating the charge number density .",
    "we can therefore deal with the diffusion of the particles carrying transport charges and the generation of the net baryon number separately .",
    "we must then : ( 1 ) solve the diffusion equations of the particles carrying the transport charges , and find the number density of all left - chiral particles @xmath274 which carry ew gauge charges ; ( 2 ) insert @xmath274 into the baryon diffusion equation , to find the generated baryon asymmetry .",

    "there are a few experiments under consideration that might detect for the first time a stochastic background of gws , for example , the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , and the big bang observer ( bbo )  @xcite , which is the follow - on mission to lisa .",
    "one of the well - motivated and convincing sources for gws is inflation , and the discovery of a relic gravitational background could be a smoking gun signal from inflation .",
    "another source of the stochastic gws are strong first - order phase transitions .",
    "in contrast with the inflationary spectrum , the spectrum from a phase transition is not flat and has a characteristic peak related to the temperature at which the phase transition took place .",
    "especially , lisa and bbo will have fairly good sensitivity at the frequencies that coincide with the redshifted spectrum of gws produced during an electroweak phase transition at temperatures around 100 gev .",
    "thus , the gw observations will give us information about ewbg since the strong first - order electroweak phase transition is a necessary requirement .",
    "there are two distinct mechanisms that can generate the gws during a first - order electroweak phase transition : the bubble collisions  @xcite and the turbulent motion of the primordial plasma  @xcite .",
    "the gws from the electroweak phase transition have been studied in a model independent way in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the results can be presented as a function of two main parameters : the typical size of the colliding bubbles and the available energy .",
    "it was concluded that a sufficiently strong electroweak phase transition could lead to an observable gw signal at lisa .",
    "however , for a definite model , the bubble size and the available energy are correlated .",
    "thus , it is still very important to study the concrete models in details .",
    "it was found previously that in the mssm the produced amount of gws is orders of magnitude below the lisa sensitivity .",
    "the situation in the nmssm seems much more promising because the trilinear term @xmath504 can naturally lead to a much stronger electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that in ref .",
    "@xcite a rough approximation was used to calculate the bubble configurations , which overestimated the strength of the phase transition and the gw signal  @xcite . moreover , in refs .",
    "@xcite the nmssm , which solves the @xmath27 problem and domain wall problem simultaneously , was considered .",
    "it was shown that the gw signals can be detected at bbo for part of parameter space , but can not be observed at lisa  @xcite .    in the smssm",
    "the strong first - order electroweak phase transitions arises from the trilinear term @xmath504 in the superpotential , which is similar to the nmssm and nmssm .",
    "the gw signals might therefore be detectable at bbo for part of the parameter space , but can not be observed at lisa  @xcite .",
    "as a side comment , the phase transition for the @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking may not be strong first order since the coupling @xmath54 in the trilinear term @xmath505 is small , and one might not be able to observe the gws from the @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "in this paper we discussed ewbg and its correlation with the neutralino cdm in the smssm .",
    "we first constructed two anomaly - free models . in model",
    "i , we embedded the @xmath55 gauge symmetry into a larger gauge symmetry , @xmath1 , whose representations are anomaly - free . we considered three families of sm fermions and one pair of higgs doublets arising from three @xmath1 fundamental representation @xmath56s . to include the sm singlet higgs particles ,",
    "achieve gauge coupling unification and cancel the @xmath0 anomaly , we assumed that three pairs of vector - like sm singlets and one pair of vector - like higgs doublets from two pairs of @xmath56 and @xmath506 are light while the other particles in the two pairs of @xmath56 and @xmath506 are absent or very heavy . in model",
    "ii , we calculated the anomaly - free conditions , and added the minimal number of exotic particles to cancel the @xmath0 anomalies .",
    "we required that all the particles have rational @xmath0 charges .",
    "although we had minimal exotic particles , we lost the gauge coupling unification .",
    "we also presented the general superpotential and the supersymmetry breaking soft terms in both models .",
    "we discussed the one - loop effective potential at finite temperature in the t  hooft - landau gauge and in the @xmath59-scheme .",
    "we showed that there exists a strong enough first order ewpt because of the large trilinear term @xmath39 in the tree - level higgs potential . unlike the mssm",
    ", the stop masses can be very heavy .",
    "the ewpt features in both models are quite similar because the exotic particles contributions to the one - loop effective potential at finite temperature are suppressed due to their heavy masses .",
    "we therefore restricted the detailed analysis to model i.    in the early universe the first order ewpt is realized by nucleating bubbles of the broken phase . crossing the bubble walls ,",
    "the vevs of the higgs fields ( including their magnitudes and phases ) are space - dependent .",
    "because the dynamical behaviors of these bubbles , such as wall profile and expansion velocity , can have important influences on the production of the baryon asymmetry , we also studied their physics in detail .",
    "numerical results show that the bubble wall thickness varies from @xmath507 as a monotonically increasing function of the phase changes of the higgs fields .",
    "we also argued that the wall velocity in the smssm can not be larger than that in the mssm under the same phase transition condition and thus should be non - relativistic .",
    "this fact implies that ew sphaleron processes have more time to occur and hence will enhance the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "we also discussed possible @xmath2 violation introduced by the extended higgs sector . unlike the mssm , where there is no @xmath2-violation at tree level in the higgs sector",
    ", the @xmath2 symmetry can be broken spontaneously as well as explicitly .",
    "with loop corrections included , there may coexist vacua at finite temperature with broken and unbroken ew symmetry .",
    "the values of these spontaneous @xmath2 phases usually are different in these vacua . in our work",
    ", the scpv provides a direct source for baryogenesis while its magnitude is mediated by an explicit one from the secluded sector .",
    "these new @xmath2 sources do not introduce significant new contributions to edms .",
    "after proper field redefinitions , the @xmath2-violation phases will only appear in the higgs mass matrix through soft masses associated with singlet components .",
    "numerical results show that , for typical parameter values , their contributions to edms will be about six or seven orders smaller than the experimental upper limits .",
    "these contributions disappear completely in the limit with a trivial explicit @xmath2 phase , where the spontaneous @xmath2 phases are trivial in the true vacuum but not where ewbg occurs .",
    "subsequently , we systematically studied non - local ewbg in both the thin wall and thick wall regimes .",
    "we calculated the contribution from leptons in the thin wall regime , and the ones from squarks , charginos and quarks in the thick wall regime in terms of the profile of bubble wall . for leptons and quarks ,",
    "the induced @xmath2-violating currents outside the bubbles are proportional to yukawa couplings squared , so we only considered the contributions from @xmath3 leptons and top quarks .",
    "we found that the @xmath2-violating currents for stops and charginos are very different from those obtained in the mssm . due to the space - dependence of the relevant @xmath2 phases",
    ", they do not require a variation of @xmath204 in the bubble wall to have a non - trivial structure at the lowest order of higgs insertion .",
    "in addition , there exists a new type of @xmath2-violating current at the leading order which can contribute to the generation of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath2-violating current of the new type has important influence on the ewbg .",
    "first , the stop contribution can be quadratically enhanced by a large @xmath68 .",
    "second , in addition to @xmath3 leptons , top squarks and charginos , top quarks can also play a significant role in the ewbg .",
    "we emphasize that all of these features are results of the scpv - driven ewbg , so they are not sensitive to the concrete embeddings of the smssm .",
    "numerical results show that the produced baryon asymmetry is large enough to explain the cosmological observations .",
    "after that , we studied the correlation between ewbg and neutralino cdm in the smssm . though we did not scan the whole parameter space",
    ", we found that there exists a region where a strong enough first order ewpt , large @xmath2 phase variations crossing the bubble wall , a reasonable baryon asymmetry , as well as an acceptable neutralino lsp relic density can be achieved simultaneously .",
    "we also commented on possible cosmological signals of the model : superconducting cosmic strings and gws .",
    "particle emission from the decays of cosmic strings and gws from ewpt could be observed within the foreseeable future .",
    "the secluded @xmath0-breaking sector plays an essential role .",
    "it induces ecpv and scpv at tree level in the higgs sector , helping avoid significant new contributions to the edms which may hinder a successful ewbg in supersymmetric models , and also influences the bubble wall physics .",
    "it provides more degrees of freedom to drive the realization of ewbg , and makes the ewbg physics in the smssm very different from those in the mssm and nmssm .",
    "these differences make it interesting to further study the relevant collider implications for the lhc  @xcite , which we will leave to future exploration .",
