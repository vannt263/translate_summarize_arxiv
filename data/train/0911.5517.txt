    "the study of production of photons with large transverse momenta in the hard interaction between two partons in the high - energy hadron collisions , so - called prompt photon production , provides precision tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as well as information on the parton densities within a hadron .",
    "also , these studies are our potential for the observation of a new dynamical regime , namely the high - energy regge limit , which is characterized by the following condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total collision energy in the center of mass reference frame , @xmath2 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd , @xmath3 is the typical energy scale of the hard interaction . at this high - energy limit ,",
    "the contribution from the partonic subprocesses involving @xmath4channel parton ( quark or gluon ) exchanges to the production cross section can become dominant . in the region under consideration",
    ", the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with `` reggeized '' @xmath4channel partons . in this",
    "kinematics , so - called quasi - multi - regge kinematics , the particles ( multi - regge ) or the groups of particles ( quasi - multi - regge ) produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity . in our discussion , the both photons from the photon pair are produced in the central region of rapidity .",
    "the quasi - multi - regge - kinematics ( qmrk ) approach @xcite is particularly appropriate for this kind of high - energy phenomenology .",
    "it is based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons @xcite and reggeized quarks @xcite . in the qmrk approach",
    "we can do calculations with reggeized quarks @xcite that presents an open question in the other uncollinear factorization scheme , namely @xmath5factorization approach @xcite , following which we can operate correctly with off - shell gluons only .",
    "recently it was shown also , that the calculation in the next to leading order ( nlo ) in strong coupling constant within the framework of qmrk approach can be done @xcite .",
    "our previous studies of charmonium and bottomonium production @xcite , open charm production @xcite and inclusive prompt photon production at the desy hera and at the fermilab tevatron @xcite demonstrated the advantages of the high - energy factorization scheme based on the qmrk approach over the collinear parton model as far as the description of experimental data is concerned .",
    "this paper continues our study of the inclusive prompt photon production at tevatron which was performed recently @xcite in the framework of the the qmrk approach .",
    "we consider here the diphoton production at the fermilab tevatron in the central region of rapidity applying the hypothesis of quark and gluon reggeization @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the main contribution to studied process is given by the direct fusion of two reggeized gluons into a photon pair , which is described by the effective reggeon - reggeon to particle - particle vertex .",
    "the contribution from the annihilation of reggeized quark - antiquark pair into a diphoton is not small and it is taken into account additionaly .",
    "we do not take into consideration the contribution of the fragmentation mechanism of the prompt photon production which is strongly suppressed by the isolation cone condition @xcite .    at the stage of numerical calculations we use the kimber - martin - ryskin prescription @xcite for unintegrated quark and gluon distribution functions , with the martin - roberts - stirling - thorne ( mrst ) collinear parton densities for a proton as input @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , the relevant reggeon - reggeon to particle - particle effective vertices are presented and discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , we describe diphoton production spectra at the tevatron collider . in sec .",
    "[ sec : foure ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the phenomenology of strong interactions at high energies , it is necessary to describe the qcd evolution of the parton distribution functions of colliding particles starting with some scale @xmath6 , which controls a non - perturbative regime , to the typical scale @xmath3 of the hard - scattering processes , which is typically of the order of the transverse mass @xmath7 of the produced particle with mass @xmath8 and transverse momentum @xmath9 . in the region of very high energies , in so - called regge limit , the typical ratio @xmath10 becomes very small , @xmath11 .",
    "that leads to large logarithmic contributions of the type @xmath12^n$ ] in the resummation procedure , which is described by the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation @xcite or other bfkl - like ones for unintegrated gluon ( quark ) distribution functions @xmath13 .",
    "correspondingly , in the qmrk approach @xcite , the initial - state @xmath14-channel gluons and quarks are considered as reggeons , or reggeized gluons @xmath15 and reggeized quarks @xmath16 .",
    "they are off - mass shell and carry finite transverse two - momenta @xmath17 with respect to the hadron beam from which they stem .",
    "the advantages of the qmrk approach include : first , it uses gauge - invariant amplitudes and is based on a factorization hypothesis that is proven in the leading logarithmic approximation ; second , it carries over to non - leading orders in the strong - coupling constant , as recently proven @xcite ; third , it works both with reggeized gluons and with reggeized quarks .",
    "the reggeization of amplitudes provides the opportunity to efficiently take into account large radiative corrections to processes in the regge limit beyond what is included in the collinear approximation , which is of great practical importance .",
    "the particle reggeization is known effect in the high - energy quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) for electrons @xcite , and for gluons @xcite and quarks @xcite in qcd .",

    "we need to construct the effective vertices with two photons in the final state , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the first one can be easy obtained from the above mentioned vertices after cutting the contribution from the three - gluon vertex and replacement the quark - gluon vertex by the same quark - photon vertex .",
    "the effective vertex @xmath25 can be obtained using the feynman rules @xcite for the reggeized gluons and the well - known fourth - rank vacuum polarization tensor , which corresponds to the set of quark - box diagrams @xcite .",
    "we perform calculations in the laboratory frame of the tevatron collider , where proton and antiproton beams have equal energies , @xmath26 gev .",

    "@xcite , we do not include on - shell quark spinors in our equations for the effective vertex ( [ ver : qbarq ] ) .",
    "we also used different normalization for the projector @xmath61 , which reads accordingly ref.@xcite as @xmath62 .",
    "our definition implies that the squared reggeized amplitude in the qmrk approach is normalized to the squared parton amplitude for on - shell quarks and gluons when @xmath63 .    at the next step",

    "during last decade the cdf and d0 collaborations at tevatron obtained experimental data for the production of prompt photons : inclusively @xcite , in association with a jet @xcite , in association with a heavy quark ( @xmath106)@xcite , and in pair @xcite .",
    "the inclusive prompt photon production was studied in the qmrk approach in the ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the main mechanism of the inclusive prompt photon production in @xmath107 collisions is the fusion of reggeized quark and reggeized antiquark into a photon , via the effective regeon - reggeon to particle ( to photon ) vertex @xmath108 .",

    "we consider the production of prompt photon pair or diphoton in the framework of the qmrk approach and compare our predictions with the cdf data @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are measured differentially as a function of the diphoton transverse momentum ( @xmath109 ) , the diphoton invariant mass ( @xmath8 ) , and the azimuthal angle between the two photons ( @xmath110 ) . in this experimental analysis",
    ", the isolation condition required that the transverse energy sum in a cone of radius @xmath111 ( in @xmath112 space ) about the photon direction , minus the photon energy , be less than 1 gev .",
    "it is important to note , that the both photons in the cdf experiment @xcite are produced in the central region of rapidity ( pseudorapidity ) @xmath113 .",
    "we can consider such photons as a quasi - multi - regge group of particles .",
    "there are two mechanisms of prompt photon production : the production of direct photons and the production of photons in fragmentation of produced quarks and gluons into photons .",
    "we have obtained @xcite that the contribution of fragmentation mechanism is strongly suppressed by the isolation cone condition , which is applied to the experimental data for the inclusive photon production @xcite .",
    "we estimate one as small , about 5 % , and do not take into account this contribution in the presented analysis too .",
    "the leading contributions in diphoton production are originating from the @xmath18 processes ( [ proc : qq ] ) and ( [ proc : rr ] ) .",
    "the first one is order of @xmath114 , the second one is order of @xmath115 .",

    "the unintegrated distribution functions and the corresponding collinear @xmath119 distribution functions are connected by the normalization condition @xmath120 that ensures the correct transition to the collinear - parton limit of equations ( [ equ : qq ] ) and ( [ equ : rr ] ) .",
    "the reggeized parton cross sections are defined in the following manner @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the flux factor of the incoming particles , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the four - momenta of produced photons .    using the formulas ( [ equ : qq ] ) , ( [ equ : rr ] ) and",

    "it is very interesting to compare the relative weight of different processes in connection with the @xmath138 order which they have .",
    "so , the contribution of @xmath139 process , which is order of @xmath115 , is greater , by factor @xmath140 , than the contribution of @xmath141 process , which is order of @xmath114 .",
    "this fact demonstrates a dominance of the gluon induced interactions at high energies .",
    "we see that suppression by factor @xmath142 is smaller that enhancement of the gluon density over the quark density in a proton at the small @xmath143 .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath144 processes ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , which are order of @xmath147 , would be unimportant for the theoretical approach used here . at first , the events when the diphoton and the quark ( gluon ) jet are produced with close ( pseudo)rapidities are suppressed by the isolation cone condition . at second , the events when the diphoton and the quark ( gluon ) jet are produced with the large ( pseudo)rapidity gap",
    "are included in the presented consideration via the effective vertices for reggeized parton interactions in the uncollinear factorization scheme , in which we use unintegrated over the transverse momentum parton distribution functions .",
