    "the baceo@xmath0 perovskite undergoes three phase transformations starting from the high temperature cubic ( c ) phase : to rhombohedral ( r ) at @xmath4  k , to orthorhombic _ imma _",
    "( o1 ) at @xmath5 670  k and to orthorhombic _ pnma _ ( o2 )  at @xmath6 563  k , as determined by neutron diffraction@xcite and by combined differential scanning calorimetry , dilatometry and x - ray diffraction.@xcite the sequence of phase transformations and the various structures are well characterized in the undoped state of baceo@xmath0 , and even a quantitative description of the spontaneous strains by means of the landau expansion of the free energy has been presented.@xcite instead , the situation is confused when a trivalent dopant , e.g. y@xmath7 , is substituted into the ce@xmath8 place in order to make the material a protonic conductor .",
    "the understanding of the influence of doping on the phase transitions in the perovskite ionic conductors is not only of academic interest .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of phase transformations , especially if accompanied by ordering of the mobile ionic species , protons and o vacancies , is closely related to the mobility of such ions and to the durability of the material in applications like fuel cells or membranes for gas separation.@xcite although various indications have been reported that the transition temperatures in baceo@xmath0 depend on doping and on the hydration state , bek98,kni01,yy03,sva93,kni99,tlr00,kmj05 no systematic study and analysis has appeared yet . according to raman spectroscopy measurements on variously doped baceo@xmath0 , the room temperature structure changes to the more symmetric tetragonal and cubic phases with increasing nd@xmath7 substitution,@xcite but a subsequent neutron diffraction experiment excludes any significant influence on the room temperature orthorhombic structure from nd doping.@xcite for bace@xmath9y@xmath10o@xmath11 ( bcy ) , a change from the o2 to the r structure at room temperature was found at @xmath12 with neutron diffraction,@xcite whereas a later x - ray diffraction study did not show such a transition to rhombohedral at room temperature , but rather impurity phases arising from a more limited y solubility range.kmj05,gld07 more recently , anelastic spectroscopy measurements on bcy showed that passing from the hydrated to the outgassed state with @xmath13 lowers the temperature of the o1-r transition by as much as 250  k.@xcite here we present a more extensive study of the effect of doping and o vacancies ( v@xmath14 ) on the phase transitions in bcy , again based on anelastic measurements .",
    "an interpretation of the observations is proposed , assuming that the driving force for the octahedral tilting instabilities is the mismatch between too long a - o and too short b - o bonds , as usual for abo@xmath15 perovskites ; a minimal model is adopted for the changes with doping and hydration level of the tolerance factor and of the lattice relaxation due to v@xmath14 .",
    "the samples of bace@xmath9y@xmath10o@xmath0 with @xmath16 0 , 0.02 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.3 were prepared as already described,@xcite with starting powders obtained by auto - combustion synthesis,@xcite followed by crystallization in air at 1273  k for 5  h. no oxide impurity phases were detected by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) after synthesis for @xmath17 .",
    "the sample with nominal @xmath18____was not monophasic , since the solubility limit of y in bcy is lower than 0.3 .",
    "in fact , impurity phases are detected by xrd for @xmath19@xcite and by exafs for @xmath20.@xcite we did not determine the exact concentration of y  in solid solution in the @xmath18 sample and in what follows we will set this value to @xmath21 .",
    "the powders were first uniaxially pressed at 50  mpa and then isostatically pressed at 200  mpa obtaining @xmath22  mm ingots , which were sintered at 1773  k for 10  h. the samples were cut as thin bars about 1  mm thick and @xmath23  cm long . in order to make them conducting for the anelastic experiments , their faces where covered with ag paint , or pt paint when temperatures higher than 900  k had to be reached .",
    "we tried with spi - chem conductive platinum paint consolidated at 1270  k , or with 1000    of pt magnetron sputtered directly on the sample surface . unfortunately",
    ", none of these electrodes resisted the anelastic measurements in vacuum @xmath24  mbar in the temperature range 1000 - 1300  k , since in all cases they evaporated away .",
    "this fact rendered the measurements at @xmath25  k difficult , and we could not obtain extensive and reliable data on the r - c transition near 1200  k.    hydration was achieved by maintaining the samples for 1 - 2  h at 793  k in a static atmosphere of @xmath26  mbar h@xmath27o , followed by slow cooling , while outgassing was achieved in vacuum @xmath24  mbar up to 1000  k or during the anelastic experiments .",
    "the resulting variations of the gaseous contents were monitored from the change of weight .",
    "the reaction of equilibrium of the odeficient perovskite with water vapor is h@xmath27o@xmath28v@xmath29o@xmath30oh@xmath31,@xcite where a molecule of water fills one v@xmath14 and provides two protons that may diffuse among o@xmath32 , to which are bound as peroxide ions ( oh)@xmath3 . the superscript dots represent excess @xmath33 charges of the species with respect to the perfect lattice in krger - vink notation . according to this reaction ,  the concentration of v@xmath34 in bace@xmath9y@xmath10o@xmath11h@xmath35 can vary within @xmath36 and concomitantly the concentration @xmath37 of protons within @xmath38 .",
    "it was found that the maximum possible hydration was @xmath39 lower than the theoretical maximum of @xmath40 ; this is usual in the doped cerate and zirconate perovskites , and can be due to partial occupation of the ba sites by the trivalent dopants or to other defects .",
    "the young s modulus @xmath41 was measured by electrostatically exciting the flexural modes of the bars suspended in vacuum on thin thermocouple wires in correspondence with the nodal lines .",
    "besides the 1st flexural mode , the 3rd and sometimes the 5th modes , with frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath43 times higher , could be measured during the same run ; the frequency of the fundamental mode was @xmath44  khz , depending on the sample shape and state .",
    "the data will be presented as real part @xmath45 of the elastic compliance @xmath46 @xmath47 , referred to its extrapolation @xmath48 to 0  k , and elastic energy loss coefficient @xmath49  @xmath50 .",
    "the first is proportional to the square of the sample resonance frequency , @xmath51 , and presents peaks or steps at the structural phase transformations ; the latter was measured from the decay of the free oscillations or from the width of the resonance peak , and presents peaks due to the relaxational motion of point and extended defects@xcite ( v@xmath14 , protons and their complexes with dopants , twin walls , etc . ) . for an elementary relaxation process it isnb72 @xmath52  with maximum at the temperatures at which the defect relaxation time @xmath53 . since @xmath54 is a decreasing function of temperature , usually according to the arrhenius law , the temperature of a thermally activated peak increases with frequency .",
    "the peaks due to the hopping of v@xmath14 and to the reorientation of protons around y dopants have already been identified,@xcite and allow one to monitor the concentrations of such defects and to study their dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the anelastic spectrum of a sample of undoped baceo@xmath0 measured at two frequencies : 1.6 and 8.4  khz .",
    "the real parts @xmath55 are practically coincident at both frequencies and present sharp steps or peaks in correspondence with the three phase transformations at @xmath56  k , @xmath57  k and @xmath58  k. these temperatures are close to those determined by neutron diffraction@xcite and define the temperature ranges of the cubic , rhombohedral and two orthorhombic phases .",
    "we identify @xmath59 of the r - c transformation with the temperature of the kink between almost flat and sharply rising compliance , rather than with the peak at a temperature 65  k lower .",
    "this also coincides with a sharp dip in the absorption .",
    "such a dip is rather anomalous , since usually one finds a peak or more or less rounded step at the onset of a structural transformation , but it clearly separates the rhombohedral region , with absorption due to the motion of domain walls , from the cubic region without appreciable anelastic losses .    ,",
    "measured at 1.6 and 8.4  khz.,width=8 ]    the elastic energy loss coefficient , besides clear anomalies in correspondence with the transitions , has five relaxation peaks in the @xmath60  k temperature range , labeled r4-r8 because there are other relaxation processes at lower temperatures ( see ref . and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] later on ) .",
    "the thermally activated character of these processes is clear from the fact that they are shifted to higher temperature at the higher frequency ( see eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) ) .",
    "y@xmath10o@xmath61h@xmath35 with @xmath13 , measured at @xmath62  khz at various hydration levels , from fully hydrated ( black ) to fully outgassed ( light grey).,width=8 ]    figure [ fig2 ] presents a series of anelastic spectra of a sample of bace@xmath63y@xmath10o@xmath0 with @xmath64 at various stages of hydration , from fully hydrated ( thick black lines )  to fully outgassed ( light grey ) ; these spectra have already been published in a preliminary study@xcite of the effect of varying hydration on the structural and elastic properties of bcy .",
    "the two @xmath65 peaks at lower temperature are labeled as rh and rv , since they are due to hopping of protons , likely around y dopants,@xcite and of v@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "their evolution allows us to confirm that the sample passes from fully hydrated ( rv is absent and rh saturated )  to fully outgassed ( rh is absent and rv saturated ) .",
    "the presence of the intermediate curves ( only few of them are reported ) allows us to ascertain that indeed outgassing shifts the transition at @xmath66 of 250  k to lower temperature , while the transition at @xmath67 is soon smeared and masked by the presence of the former transition , but does not seem to shift appreciably .",
    "measured in the hydrated and outgassed states.,width=8 ]    the effect of y@xmath7  doping on the phase transformations at @xmath66 and @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the elastic compliance curves are plotted of samples having @xmath16 0 , 0.02 , 0.10 , 0.15 and 0.2 in the fully hydrated and fully outgassed states .",
    "there is no outgassed curve at @xmath21 , because the sample broke after the first measurement . with increasing doping , and hence lattice disorder",
    ", there is progressive smearing of the peaks at the transitions , so that @xmath67 becomes more and more difficult to determine .",
    "this is especially true in the outgassed state , where the transition at @xmath66 , whose effects on the elastic compliance are prevalent , shifts consistently to lower temperature and masks the effects of the o2-o1 transition .",
    "note that there is an inversion in the trend of the anelastic spectra between @xmath13 and 0.15 , as discussed later .",
    "the transition temperatures deduced from these curves will be plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .     in an intermediate hydration state ,",
    "measured at three frequencies.,width=8 ]    we finally present an example of @xmath65 curves measured at three different frequencies , where it is particularly clear that the dynamics of the v@xmath14 is not simply that of independent defects , which would give rise to a debye relaxation , eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) , but seems to have an important contribution from cooperative effects , possibly connected with v@xmath14 ordering in the o2 phase .",
    "the @xmath69 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are measured at 3.3 , 18 and 44  khz on a sample with @xmath70 in an intermediate state of hydration where both v@xmath34 and h are present . among the various peaks , with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we recognize rh , probably due to reorientation of h about y dopants,@xcite while rv is certainly due to v@xmath14 , although it is not yet determined whether trapping by y has a role .",
    "the interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is that the intensity of peak rv is a drastically increasing function of temperature , instead of having the @xmath71 dependence expected from eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) .",
    "the effect is not due to o loss during the measurements in vacuum , since the curves at different frequencies are measured during a same run , and we have abundant data showing that the @xmath72 are perfectly reproducible until one does not exceed 500  k. we mention that also the relaxation peak r6 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays a similar behavior , although the divergence of its intensity on approaching @xmath67 might be partially due to overlapping with the narrow dissipation peak associated with the structural transition .",
    "we did not make a thorough analysis of these complicated anelastic spectra , and can not say yet whether r6 involves v@xmath14 , twin walls or both ; it certainly appears that the motion of the v@xmath14 has a high degree of cooperativity below @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the transition temperatures @xmath59 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 plotted versus y doping in both the fully hydrated and outgassed states .",
    "the temperatures @xmath66 and @xmath67 are determined from both the real parts @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the respective @xmath65 curves ( not reported here ) , while @xmath59 is determined from fig .",
    "the o1-r phase transformation is the better characterized in the present measurements and exhibits the largest dependence on doping : an increase of @xmath66 with doping in the hydrated state and an even larger decrease in the outgassed state .",
    "notice that there is a difference of nearly 30  k between outgassed and hydrated state even at @xmath74 , which may be due to the contribution of electronic compensation or to the presence of some defects , _",
    "e.g. _ from non perfect stoichiometry .",
    "the transition at @xmath67 between the two orthorhombic structures is less affected by doping and by o  stoichiometry . differently from that at @xmath66 , it decreases slightly its temperature with doping in the hydrated state , while only at @xmath70 it was possible to verify the lowering of the transition temperature after outgassing , because of the masking effect of the transition at @xmath66 .",
    "the r - c transformation has only one point for the undoped case , because our results are only partial and preliminary , due to the experimental difficulties explained in section ii . in addition , our anelastic experiments are made in high vacuum , so that above 800  k it is impossible to maintain the sample in the hydrated state , and we can only measure reliably the temperature @xmath59 of bcy in the outgassed state . also in the literature there are no data on @xmath59 of doped bcy .    in what follows",
    "we will try to explain the fact that the temperature @xmath75 increases with y doping @xmath1 in the hydrated state , and instead decreases with @xmath1 of an even larger amount in the outgassed state . the uncertainty in the values of @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is smaller than the symbol size , and the fact that the points at @xmath64 and 0.15 do not follow a monotonic trend with doping is likely real and not an experimental vagary .",
    "this anomaly can be put in relation with the observation of a jump or extremum in the doping dependence of several structural parameters of baceo@xmath11 and srceo@xmath11 at a nominal concentration of v@xmath14 @xmath76,@xcite corresponding to @xmath77 in the fully outgassed state .",
    "this phenomenon has been tentatively attributed to ordering of the v@xmath14 commensurate with the lattice during the synthesis at high temperature , hence with possible ordering of the cation dopants that would affect the hydration properties also at lower temperature.@xcite we will ignore this local inversion of the variation of @xmath78 and only consider the positive average derivative of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath1 , and negative derivative of @xmath80 .    in searching for the relevant factors determining @xmath66 , we note that the o1-r transition involves tilting of the o octahedra , without the atomic off - centering accompanying the ferroelectric transitions or additional jahn - teller distortions , since neither ce@xmath8 nor y@xmath7 are jahn - teller active .",
    "bcy is also inert from the magnetic point of view , so that we conclude that the main driving force for the octahedra to tilt is the mismatch between too long b - o bonds ( b  = ce / y )  and too short a - o bonds ( a  = ba ) , as usual for abo@xmath0 perovskites.@xcite the tendency of perovskites to undergo tilting transitions is often expressed in terms of the tolerance factor @xmath81where the mean ionic radii are the effective ones usually taken from shannon s tables.@xcite a value @xmath82 means that the ideal a - o and b - o bond lengths , taken as the sums of the ideal ionic radii , perfectly match the cubic structure , and therefore that the cubic phase should be stable ; @xmath83 means that the b - o bond length is too large with respect to the a - o one , and therefore that the octahedra tend to rotate in order to accommodate the mismatch .",
    "the longer and weaker a - o bonds have larger thermal expansion than the shorter and stronger b - o bonds . for this reason ,",
    "perovskites with @xmath83 already at high temperature further decrease @xmath84 on cooling , until the mismatch between too long b - o and too short a - o bonds is relived by a tilting structural transformation .",
    "usually , with decreasing @xmath84 below 1 , one finds first tilt patterns producing a more symmetric rhombohedral structure and then the more distorted orthorhombic structures.@xcite in this respect , baceo@xmath0 behaves normally , with the cubic phase transforming into rhombohedral @xmath85 and further into orthorhombic o1 ( _ _ i__@xmath86 ) and o2 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the tilt patterns in glazer s notation@xcite are respectively @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the anomaly in the sequence of transformations is the intermediate loss of a tilt system passing from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "yet , the general trend of c , r and ostructures with decreasing @xmath84 is obeyed , and the final @xmath90 tilt system is the usual ground state of tilted perovskites,@xcite also favored by the slightly covalent component of the a - o bonds.gk73,woo97 it can be concluded that the tolerance factor should be the relevant parameter in promoting the structural transformations in bcy .",
    "another indication in this sense is the fact that srceo@xmath0 , having a still smaller @xmath84 due the smaller sr ionic radius , remains in the o2 phase at least up to 1270  k.@xcite    it has been noted that , in perovskites with cation chemical disorder in the a sublattice , the temperatures of the structural , and especially magnetic and electronic transitions appear to be sensitive to both the tolerance factor , which measures the coherent strain effect , and the variance of the a cations sizes , which measures the incoherent part.@xcite in the present case we are dealing only with structural transformations , without the additional critical dependence on the bond angles involved in the electronic and magnetic transitions , and we will just take into account the average effects included in @xmath84 .    for the limited objective of understanding the effect of doping and hydration on the structural transformations , but not their detailed nature , we keep the analysis as simple as possible , following the idea that the driving force for the @xmath93-th tilting transition is the decrease of @xmath84 below some critical value @xmath94 , and therefore that the transition temperatures are proportional to such a driving force , @xmath95the dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath1 can be estimated by assuming vegard s law , namely that the introduction of a molar concentration @xmath1 of defects , each contributing with a change @xmath96 to the ionic volume , causes an isotropic volume change equal to @xmath97 . in addition",
    "we consider a purely ionic picture with each ion having its nominal valence .",
    "the ionic species and their molar fractions , coordination numbers and radii are listed in table i.    .ionic species of bcy and their molar fractions , radii and coordination numbers , according to shannon [ cols= \" > , > , > , > \" , ]     notice that there is no difference between the use of ionic and crystal radii of the shannon tables,@xcite since they all differ by @xmath98   , depending whether they are anions or cations , and the a - o and b - oideal distances are unaffected by the choice .",
    "the tolerance factor of undoped baceo@xmath0 resulting from table i , to be considered as referred to the o2 room temperature structure , is @xmath99 .",
    "dealing with complete outgassing or hydration , we discard the electronic compensation and assume that the chemical formula of bcy with @xmath100 v@xmath14 and @xmath101h@xmath27o is ba@xmath102ce@xmath103y@xmath104o@xmath105oh@xmath106 , with the charge compensation requiring @xmath107hydrated and outgassed states are therefore defined by @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the proton is assumed to form the hydroxide complex ( oh)@xmath3 , whose radius is also tabulated .",
    "the assumption is corroborated by the observation that h fills the hole at the top of the bonding ce @xmath110o @xmath111 valence band , mostly of o @xmath111 character , which is introduced by trivalent doping in dry atmosphere.@xcite certainly , the approximation of a spherical ( oh)@xmath3 ion is inadequate , but this is discussed later on .    the tolerance factor of doped bcy can then be written as @xmath112with @xmath113where @xmath114 , @xmath115 @xmath116  is not very influent because it appears in the same manner in the numerator and denominator of @xmath84 , and the presence of v@xmath14 is not taken into account yet .",
    "it is sometimes assumed that the radius of an v@xmath14 in a perovskite is the same as that of the o@xmath32  ion,@xcite and the fact that o deficient perovskites such as lacoo@xmath11 increase their volume with increasing @xmath100 is attributed to the enhanced radius of the reduced b cation.kkt02c,hsb03,zvp08 in the present case , it is evident that a similar assumption would not explain the marked depression of the transition temperatures of the outgassed state with respect to the hydrated and the undoped states .",
    "such a depression would require an increase of @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ tn1 ] ) , which is not supported by any indication .",
    "the reduction of @xmath117 must arise from the elimination of the b - o - b and a - o - a bonds , whose rigid networks compete against each other , with expansive and compressive pressures respectively .",
    "the introduction of v@xmath14 therefore relaxes the driving force for the tilting structural transformations , reducing it by an amount @xmath118 . in the absence of a more detailed and quantitative estimate of the structural relaxation introduced by v@xmath119",

    "the value of @xmath122 , or more properly the shape of the function @xmath118 , and particularly the value of @xmath100 at which it vanishes , should be connected with the critical concentration of v@xmath14 at which continuum sequences of bonds disappear over some length scale . yet",

    "there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the initial slopes of the curves , due to the above mentioned anomaly between @xmath13 and 0.15 , but the main features can be reproduced with reasonable parameters . this simple reasoning might be applied also to the other two transitions at @xmath59 and @xmath67 , with different values for the critical tolerance factors @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 and possibly also for the proportionality factor @xmath145 because the different structures relax the mismatch between a - o and b - o sublattices at varying degrees .",

    "the o1-o2 transition is the ordering of the v@xmath34 .",
    "in fact , while the v@xmath14 are disordered in their three equivalent o sublattices in the rhombohedral structure and also in the orthorhombic o1 , they are confined to only two sublattices , avoiding the third crystallographically inequivalent sublattice , in the o2 structure.tlr00,kni01 it is not clear whether v@xmath14 ordering is concomitant with the transition or it occurs at a slower rate after the transition is completed .",
    "we have already noted@xcite that a possible sign of cooperative ordering of v@xmath14 is the anelastic relaxation process labeled as r6 , whose intensity seems to diverge on approaching @xmath66 from below , as expected from critical ordering of the elastic quadrupoles associated with the v@xmath14.@xcite a  similar divergence of the relaxation strength @xmath155 is shown in fig .",

    "the fact that the decrease of @xmath67 in the hydrated state is smaller then for @xmath66 , instead , must involve completely different mechanisms .",
    "a possibility is that on cooling the proton localizes itself more and more within the plane perpendicular to the b - o - b bond,@xcite effectively resulting in an increased flattening of the hydroxide ion and hence in a reduction of its effective radius along the b - o - b bond direction .",
    "such an effect , namely an additional reduction of the b - oh - b but not of the a - oh - a bond lengths on cooling , would reduce the mismatch between the two bond networks and result in a stabilization of the higher temperature phase , hence a decrease of @xmath67 .",
    "finally , let us compare these dependencies of the transition temperatures on y doping with those measured by xrd and dilatometry with yb doping.yy03 those data have been considered insufficient,@xcite due to the smallness of the anomalies in the linear expansion , which also exhibit an additional dip not associated with any phase transformation , and the limited number of diffraction peaks that were analyzed . yet ,",

    "the main difference between the two sets of experiments is that @xmath141 with yb  has a much weaker rise with doping than with y and only for _ _  _ _ @xmath159 , while @xmath160 even decreases with doping .",
    "this difference can also be explained within the above model , since the radius of yb@xmath7 is slightly smaller than that of ce@xmath8 , instead of larger as for y@xmath7 , so that with yb it is @xmath161 @xmath162    instead of @xmath163   .",

    "the most complete data are for the intermediate transition between orthorhombic _ imma _ and rhombohedral at @xmath66 ; the data of the transition at the lowest temperature @xmath67 to the orthorhombic _ pnma _ phase are incomplete in the outgassed state , due to overlapping with the transition at @xmath66 , whose effects prevail in the anelastic spectra . of the transition to the cubic phase we could measure only the temperature @xmath56  k in the undoped state .",
    "the main result is that @xmath141 increases roughly as @xmath165 in the fully hydrated state and decreases twice as much in the fully outgassed state .",
    "an anomaly with respect to the monotonic trend between @xmath64 and 0.15 is associated with similar anomalies already observed in various structural parameters at the same doping level , while the average trend is explained with a simple model . as usual",
    ", it is assumed that the main driving force for the structural transformations , which consist of rotations of the bo@xmath166 octahedra ( b = ce , y ) , is the mismatch between the more rigid and compressed network of b - o - b  bonds and the network of ba - o - ba bonds under expansion .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath129 are assumed to be proportional to @xmath167 , where @xmath84 is the tolerance factor measuring the ratio between the ideal ba - o and b - o bond lengths , @xmath168 a critical value of @xmath84 below which the @xmath93-th tilting transition occurs , and @xmath122 a parameter determined by how much the mismatch stress between different types of bonds is relieved by the presence of o vacancies . in this manner",
    "it is possible to explain the experimental @xmath169 data with reasonable parameters , and also to reproduce @xmath170 with @xmath171 0.97 , which is just the lower limit of the known range @xmath150 for cubic perovskites .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath67 , instead , decreases with doping and has a reduced difference between hydrated and outgassed states . these differences with respect to @xmath172",
    "are tentatively explained in terms of a reduction of the mismatch between the bond lengths , due to a flattening of the effective shape of the hydroxide ion perpendicularly to the b - o - b bond during cooling , and to the ordering of the o  vacancies in the _ pnma _ phase .",
