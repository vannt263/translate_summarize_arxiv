    "at this conference we have seen a huge amount of experimental data being presented on @xmath0-physics , data from which we would like to extract fundamental information about the parameters of the standard model and cp - violation , and ( by overconstraining the comparison with the standard model ) to search for signals of new physics .",
    "of course much more data will become available in the coming years .",
    "a major difficulty in achieving the above goals is our inability to quantify non - perturbative strong interaction effects .",
    "lattice qcd provides the opportunity for evaluating these effects _ ab initio _ , and there is indeed a wide - ranging program of numerical simulations of @xmath0-physics . in this lecture",
    "i will briefly review some of the recent progress in lattice studies of @xmath0-physics .",
    "it is not appropriate for me in this talk to discuss technical aspects of lattice calculations in any detail , i will therefore concentrate on presenting results and discussing the potential for future calculations .",
    "i start with some basic facts about lattice calculations in @xmath0-physics . in any simulation the computing resources",
    "are limited , and one therefore has to compromise when minimising competing systematic errors , those due to the granularity of the lattice ( discretization effects ) and finite - volume errors . in current simulations ,",
    "this typically leads to a choice for the lattice spacing ( @xmath4 ) in the range given by @xmath54gev , i.e. @xmath4 is larger than the compton wavelength of the @xmath3-quark .",
    "this means that we can not study the propagation of a physical @xmath3-quark directly and either have to i ) use effective theories , such as the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) or non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) or ii ) calculate physical quantities with the heavy - quark mass @xmath6 in the region of @xmath7 ( the mass of the charm - quark ) , and perform the extrapolation to @xmath8 .",
    "the precision of lattice calculations is limited by systematic uncertainties .",
    "these can be overcome in principle with increased computing resources and much effort is being devoted to reducing these uncertainties ( and in particular to eliminating _ quenching _ ,",
    "i.e. to include vacuum polarisation effects ) .",
    "most , but not all , of the results presented below have been obtained in the quenched approximation .",
    "it should be remembered however , that even in unquenched simulations the masses of the sea quarks are large   decay is kinematically possible . ] .",
    "controlling the effects of sea - quarks is perhaps the major challenge for the lattice community and in recent years we have began to address this challenge .    from lattice simulations",
    "we know how to calculate matrix elements of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are hadrons and @xmath13 is some local composite operator ( several examples of such matrix elements will be discussed below ) . we are not yet in a position to compute matrix elements in which there are two or more hadrons in the initial or final state , and are therefore unable to compute @xmath14 decays amplitudes , but progress is being made in this area ( see sect .

    "sec : nonlept ] below ) .",
    "the plan of this lecture is as follows . in the next section",
    "i briefly review the results for some _ standard _ physical quantities : leptonic decay constants @xmath1 and @xmath15 ; the @xmath2-parameters of @xmath16-@xmath0 mixing and form - factors for semileptonic decays . sect .",

    "the errors will not decrease significantly until we begin to get a serious control of quenching errors .",

    "these effects can only be studied meaningfully if all other variables are kept constant . using results from the milc  @xcite , cppacs  @xcite and nrqcd  @xcite collaborations , c.  bernard estimates that there is about a 20  mev increase in the value of @xmath1 in going from the quenched approximation to the @xmath22 case ( using @xmath23 to set the scale )  @xcite .",

    "for example discretization errors have been studied by using improved actions and/or extrapolating the results to the continuum limit .",
    "it had been suggested that @xmath1 may be significantly lower than the results presented above because of discretization errors ( this suggestion was based on some extrapolations to the chiral limit ) , but this has not survived more careful analyses  @xcite .    when lattice computations of the leptonic decay constants of heavy mesons were beginning there were no experimental data . in 1997",
    "we compiled the ( quenched ) lattice predictions for the decays constants of charmed mesons as  @xcite : @xmath25 the particle data group s review this year quotes @xmath26mev  @xcite as the best experimental result ( and recent results , still with large errors , are compatible with this ) .",

    "i conclude with a brief summary of the main points of this talk :    * lattice simulations are a central tool in the determination of information about fundamental physics from experimental data .",
    "they are being applied to a wide range of quantities in @xmath0-physics . *",
    "the numerical results presented in sections  [ sec : fb]-[sec : mb ] are an important part of the conclusions . * for _ standard quantities _ , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the emphasis is on the control of systematic errors , particularly those due to quenching . for other quantities ( e.g. the applications to inclusive decays discussed in section  [ sec : inclusive ] ) the calculations are just beginning . * for @xmath158 light - meson semileptonic ( and radiative ) decays , the matrix elements are computed at large values of @xmath58 and theoretically motivated extrapolations are performed to lower values of @xmath58 .",
    "where possible , to make optimum use of lattice results , a comparison with the experimental distributions at large values of @xmath58 should be made . * for two - body non - leptonic decays theoretical developments are needed before lattice simulations can provide information .",
    "progress has been made for @xmath146 decays and we can look forward to extensions to @xmath0-physics .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge correspondence with claude bernard and vittorio lubicz with detailed information about new results which were presented at lattice 2000 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank j.flynn , d.lin , g.martinelli and m.testa for many instructive discussions .",
