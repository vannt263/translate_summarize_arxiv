    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are among the most luminous objects in the local universe , with both their luminosities ( @xmath7 emerging mainly in the far - infrared ) and space densities being similar to those of quasars ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "ulirgs have large molecular gas concentrations in their central kpc regions ( e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ) with densities comparable to those of the stars of elliptical galaxies . for increasing infrared ( ir ) luminosities , their mid - ir slopes and silicate depths",
    "also increase , suggesting that their nuclei are more obscured and more compact ( stierwalt et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "kormendy & sanders ( 1992 ) proposed that ulirgs evolve into elliptical galaxies through merger - induced dissipative collapse . in this scenario ,",
    "these mergers first go through a luminous starburst phase , followed by a dust - enshrouded active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phase , and finally evolve into an optically bright , _ naked _ quasar once they either consume or shed their shells of gas and dust ( sanders et al .",

    "we observed the mid - ir spectro - photometric standard star hd  79354 ( cohen 1999 ) before the science target . allowing for overheads ,",
    "this was 20 min before the science observations .",
    "the standard star is used to perform the photometric calibration , estimate the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the science observation , and perform the point spread function ( psf ) subtraction .",
    "we measured the fwhm of the data by fitting the radial profile of the standard star with a gaussian function and obtained a value of @xmath35 .",
    "table  [ tab0 ] summarizes the details of the observations .",
    "we also obtained long - slit mid - ir spectroscopy of the nuclear region of ugc  5101 on the same night .",

    "[ tab0 ] we list the position angles ( pa ) of the slit , measured from the north to the east .",
    "the observing sequence was as follows .",
    "we first took an acquisition image of the galaxy with the si-2 filter , then centered the slit on the peak mid - ir brightness , and finally integrated for the on - source integration times given in table  [ tab0 ] .",

    "2011 ) and the emission contribution by the starburst - subtracted nuclear component at 12@xmath0 m from the gtc / cc spectral decomposition after correcting for the derived foreground extinction ( see table  4 ) , we predict an intrinsic hard x - ray luminosity @xmath41 erg s@xmath6 . applying a bolometric correction @xmath42\\times l_{\\rm 2 - 10 kev}$ ] ( marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) we found a bolometric luminosity between @xmath43 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this range of agn bolometric luminosities is lower than our estimate from the clumpy torus model fit to the unresolved nuclear ir emission and the starburst - subtracted nuclear cc spectrum of ugc  5101 .",
    "gonzlez - martn et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on the other hand , estimated an x - ray luminosity @xmath44 erg s@xmath6 after applying a compton - thick correction to the observed @xmath45kev emission .",
    "if we consider the above bolometric correction , then the agn bolometric luminosity is consistent with the value derived from fitting the clumpy torus models to the unresolved ir emission and starburst - subtracted nuclear cc spectrum with that predict from the hard x - ray vs. 12 @xmath0 m correlation .",
    "the inferred agn bolometric luminosity from the clumpy torus modelling accounts approximately for @xmath46 of the ir luminosity of the system , which is determined using the fluxes in all four iras bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 m ) and the flux - luminosity correlation in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the agn bolometric luminosity ( see table  6 ) this value is consistent with other estimates in the literature .",
    "for instance , lonsdale et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using high angular resolution radio observations estimated a 30% agn contribution in ugc  5101 .",
    "veilleux et al .",
    "( 2009 ) derived a similar value ( @xmath47 ) using a number of spectral mid - ir diagnostics using the _ spitzer_/irs spectroscopy .    in summary ,",
    "despite the fact that the clumpy models do not fit simultaneously all the near- and mid - ir unresolved emission , and starburst - subtracted nuclear cc spectrum of ugc  5101 , the derived agn bolometric luminosity is consistent with estimates using other methods . in our modelling",
    "the agn bolometric luminosity is only a function of the scaling factor of the models to the data , which is driven mostly by the fluxes near the peak of the torus emission . in the case of ugc  5101",
    ", the peak of the best - fit clumpy torus model is at @xmath48 m ( see fig .",
    "[ bcsed ] , left panel ) and the @xmath49-band data point ( observed @xmath50 m ) is the closest to that peak .",
    "therefore even for deeply embedded agn , the modelling of the unresolved nuclear emission and the starburst - subtracted spectroscopy with the clumpy torus models can still be useful for deriving the agn bolometric luminosity , as this quantity is driven by the scaling of the model and is less subject to the detailed modelling of the near and mid - ir sed and the silicate feature .",
    "we have presented new high angular resolution ( @xmath51arcsec ) @xmath52 m mid - ir imaging and @xmath53 m spectroscopy of the nuclear region of the ulirg ugc  5101 using cc on the gtc .",
    "we also analyzed archival _",
    "hst_/nicmos near - ir and subaru / comics @xmath49-band imaging and _ spitzer_/irs spectroscopy .",
    "the presence of pah emission in the nuclear ( central @xmath54pc ) cc spectrum indicates that some of the dust in central region is being heated by the uv radiation of relatively young stars .",
    "therefore , to study the physical and geometrical properties of the obscuring material surrounding the agn of ugc  5101 , it was necessary to disentangle the ir emission presumably due to dust heated by the agn from that due to nuclear star formation and/or stellar emission .    by using galfit we were able to separate the unresolved nuclear emission from the extended host galaxy emission using the near - ir ( 1.60 and @xmath55 m ) and mid - ir ( 8.7 and @xmath50 m ) imaging data .",
    "we also calculated the unresolved emission at @xmath52 m with other methods , namely _ psf - subtraction _ and _ psf - scaling _ and found that the resulting fluxes were similar to those derived with galfit .",
    "in addition , we found that the srsic parameters , which represent the extended emission , derived at near- and mid - ir wavelengths are consistent with each other .",
    "for the mid - ir spectroscopy we used a spectral decomposition method to estimate the emission of the obscuring material around the agn , which we represented as an extinguished power - law continuum .",
    "we also allowed both components to have different foreground extinctions . from the spectral decomposition of the irs data we found an index of the power - law ( @xmath56 ) consistent with the values observed for seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 nuclei ( ramos almeida et al .",
    "2011 ) . given the limited spectral range of the cc spectrum for the decomposition we fixed the index of the power - law and starburst template to those derived for the irs data .",
    "within the uncertainties the starburst - subtracted nuclear fluxes at 8.7 and @xmath57 m cc continuum component are consistent with those derived from the spectral decomposition of the irs spectrum .",
    "in addition , the starburst - subtracted nuclear flux at @xmath52 m is also consistent within the uncertainties with the value derived with the galfit modelling of the cc imaging data .",
    "we also estimated that in the central 393pc of ugc  5101 the power - law component at @xmath52 m and @xmath57 m ( observed wavelengths ) contributes @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the nuclear emission , respectively .    before fitting the unresolved sed of ugc  5101 with the clumpy torus models of nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) , we subtracted the fitted starburst component from the gtc / cc nuclear observed spectrum .",
    "we found that clumpy torus models with a high covering factor and a high foreground extinction ( @xmath60mag ) fit well the silicate feature and unresolved mid - ir emission .",
    "the high value of the foreground extinction is similar to results for other deeply embedded agn in local lirgs and ulirgs ( see e.g. alonso - herrero et al . 2013 and mori et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , the observed unresolved near - ir emission of ugc  5101 is well above the fitted clumpy models .",
    "this could be due to contamination by nuclear stellar emission even at the angular resolution of @xmath61arcsec of the nicmos data or more likely due to the presence of hot dust clouds .",
    "we also showed that the observed @xmath62 m nuclear flux is much higher than the extrapolation to the far - ir of the fitted torus models .",
    "again , this indicates that there is strong nuclear star formation , as also indicated by the presence of pah emission in the cc spectrum , and this component also dominates the far - ir nuclear emission of ugc  5101 .    even though the clumpy torus models are not able to reproduce simultaneously the nuclear unresolved near and mid - ir emission , and the starburst - subtracted gtc / cc nuclear spectrum of ugc  5101 , the derived agn bolometric luminosity ( @xmath63erg s@xmath6 ) is consistent with that estimated from hard x - rays ( gonzlez - martn et al .",
    "2009 ) but higher than that from the @xmath64kev vs. @xmath65 m correlation ( gandhi et al . 2009 ; levenson et al . 2009 ; asmus et al . 2011 ) .",
