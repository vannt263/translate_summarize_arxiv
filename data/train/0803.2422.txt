    "the point is that the momentum assignment for the internal fermion lines is not completely fixed by momentum conservation in the interaction vertices ; it is unique up to a shift of the integration variable .",

    "the reason is , of course , that the mean - field thermodynamic potential includes only the contribution of the fermions , whereas in the bec regime the total number density is dominated by the bosons . in the rbec limit ( that is for @xmath130 ) , both bosons and fermions are excited significantly , and the reliability of the mean - field approximation again improves .    in fig .",

    "the ng bound state is present for all values of the coupling , as guaranteed by the goldstone theorem . on the other hand",
    ", the antiboson pole appears only on the bec side of the crossover , just as in the normal phase .",
    "it should be stressed that the positions of the antiboson poles in @xmath140 and @xmath141 differ , simply because one of the bosons is composed of a gapped and an ungapped ( anti)quark , while the other one of two gapped ( anti)quarks . indeed , the pole in @xmath141 occurs at a smaller ( negative ) @xmath30 ; the corresponding boson is heavier .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath139 the difference is so small that it can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_at_t0 ] .    apart from the presence of the isolated antiboson pole on the bec side of the crossover ( and its absence on the bcs side ) , the qualitative appearance of the spectrum does not change as the coupling is varied . as noted above",
    ", the antiboson pole has different positions in @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the same , of course , holds for the onset of the continuum in these spectra . as we proceed from the bcs to the bec to the rbec regime , the gap in the spectrum of red and green quarks increases , and the difference between @xmath140 and @xmath141 becomes more pronounced .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : antiboson_mass ] we show the coupling - dependence of the two antiboson masses . in the bec regime , they are almost equal and essentially determined by the chemical potential .",
    "however , this changes dramatically in the rbec regime . while the pole in @xmath141 appears near the two - antiparticle continuum ,",
    "now dominated by the large value of the gap , the antiboson pole in @xmath140 is still driven by the chemical potential .",
    "we checked numerically that as the temperature is increased , the mass of the antiboson in @xmath141 follows ( twice ) the value of the gap until very close to the phase transition , where it merges with the mass of the antiboson in @xmath140 .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that in the normal phase , both masses ( being equal ) are determined by the chemical potential .",
    "( lower solid line ) and @xmath141 ( upper solid line ) at zero temperature and momentum . for comparison",
    ", we also show the values of @xmath142 ( dashed ) and @xmath143 ( dotted ) . ]",
    "another fact to note is the order - of - magnitude suppression of the anomalous spectral density @xmath144 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , with the exception of the rbec limit , the gap is much smaller than other scales in the theory such as the fermi energy or chemical potential .",
    "this tiny off - diagonal ( in the nambu space ) element of the correlation function matrix @xmath45 then induces mixing between the bound boson and antiboson states , or in other words , breaks the conservation of the baryon number carried by the quarks .",
    "consequently , the spectral density @xmath145 displays , besides the expected two - particle continuum at positive frequency , also an analogous continuum at negative frequency , yet with much smaller spectral weight . in @xmath146 ,",
    "this continuum is absent due to the existence of the conserved charge of the unbroken @xmath104 .      at nonzero temperature and momentum",
    "the spectrum becomes more rich .",
    "the bound - state peaks acquire nonzero ( even though tiny ) width and the landau damping appears .",
    "having in mind that the low - energy dynamics of the system in the superfluid phase is dominated by the ng bosons , we display in fig . [ fig : gb_spectra_nonzero_t ] the positive - frequency parts of the spectral density @xmath140 ; each panel collects the spectra for several values of the momentum .",
    "the ng excitations are manifested by isolated peaks below the two - particle continuum .",
    "comparison of spectra for temperatures close to zero and to the phase transition reveals the temperature effects : the overall increase of the background due to thermal excitations , and the landau damping , especially strong in the rbec regime .",
    "we can also see how with increasing momentum the ng boson peaks get closer to the continuum ; at a certain point they will reach the continuum and disappear from the spectrum as isolated poles .",
    "2ex     in addition to the full spectra , we also studied the dispersion relations of the ng bosons at zero temperature .",
    "these can be extracted from the spectral densities and , in case of the type - ii ng bosons , compared to the analytical low - momentum prediction from eq . .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gb_dispersions ] .",
    "general consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking in presence of nonzero charge density @xcite require that the dispersion relation of the ng boson in @xmath140 and @xmath141 is , at low momentum , quadratic and linear , respectively .",
    "the scale that defines this low - momentum region is typically set by the symmetry breaking . above this scale ,",
    "the ng boson dispersion relation is no longer fixed by the general properties of symmetry breaking , but rather is determined by the detailed dynamics of the system under consideration . in some cases , the ng boson may even cease to exist at high enough momentum ; in our model , this is reflected by its disappearance in the continuum .",
    "we display the dispersion relations in a logarithmic scale in order to exhibit their power - law behavior .",
    "apparently , the low - momentum region governed by the broken symmetry is indeed defined by the symmetry - breaking scale , i.e. , the gap .",
    "the only exception is the rbec limit where the predicted quadratic dispersion of the type - ii ng boson is observed only below the scale of the chemical potential , which is much smaller than the gap .",
    "this is because above the chemical potential the particles and antiparticles become nearly degenerate and all effects of finite density are strongly suppressed .    in the bec regime",
    ", we can even distinguish three regions of momentum with physically distinct behavior .",
    "first , at @xmath147 , the dispersions of the ng bosons are governed by the broken symmetry and match the classification into type i and type ii .",
    "second , for momenta larger than a few times the gap but smaller than the fermion mass @xmath3 , the dispersions of all ng bosons become quadratic .",
    "this is in accord with the bogolyubov theory of nonrelativistic bec @xcite .",
    "finally , for @xmath148 we enter the relativistic regime and the dispersions become linear again .",
    "( although it can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gb_dispersions ] , the ng bosons disappear in the continuum at @xmath149 .",
    "so in a linear scale , this relativistic domain actually covers a large part of the dispersion relations . )",
    "let us also remark that in the bcs regime , the frequency marking the onset of the two - particle continuum remains strictly constant for all values of momentum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gb_dispersions ] .",
    "the reason is that only in the bcs regime has the dispersion of the fermionic quasiparticles a nontrivial minimum .",
    "consequently , for all momenta @xmath88 up to the fermi momentum , @xmath150 , the pair mode may decay into two fermions both lying on their fermi surfaces .",
    "so the continuum sets at @xmath151 in @xmath140 and at @xmath152 in @xmath141 .",
    "another hint on the range of momentum where the universal predictions of the broken symmetry apply is provided by the size of the coefficients @xmath122 defined by eq . .",
    "fig : gbdispersion ] we plot these coefficients against the inverse coupling . apparently , the coefficient @xmath126 which gives rise to the quadratic onset of the dispersion of the type - ii ng boson , is suppressed in both the bcs and rbec regimes . in the bcs limit , this is because the populations of the gapped and ungapped quarks are almost the same and hence the density of the non - abelian charge @xmath107 goes to zero . in the rbec limit ,",
    "the reason is the above - mentioned particle  antiparticle symmetry .",
    "is plotted by the solid line and @xmath153 by the dashed one . ]",
    "in this paper we studied the relativistic bcs  bec crossover in a class of njl - type models . within the mean - field approximation , we investigated the superfluid phase with particular focus on the collective bosonic excitations .",
    "the formalism we developed is general enough to cover all possible spin - zero pairing patterns .",
    "the calculation of the thermodynamic potential up to one bosonic loop splits into a kinematic and an algebraic part .",
    "the kinematic part is universal and the choice of the pairing pattern enters only through the values of the gap parameters in the fermionic quasiparticle dispersion relations .",
    "the algebraic part bears all necessary information about the pairing pattern and can be done at once by means of a simple trace .    despite the apparent generality of our model lagrangian ,",
    "two extensions are necessary before the model can claim phenomenological relevance for relativistic bcs  bec crossover .",
    "first , it would be desirable to have different chemical potentials for the individual fermion flavors in order to be able to account for external ( e.g. magnetic ) fields , or for the requirement of overall charge neutrality .",
    "second , we should also include fermion ",
    "antifermion pairing channels so that we can describe the constituent quark masses and the competition between the chiral and diquark condensates .    as a particular application",
    ", we described the bcs  bec crossover in the two - flavor color superconductor .",
    "we investigated in detail the spectrum of ng bosons .",
    "their low - momentum behavior was checked to comply with the general consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking at finite charge density .",
    "concretely , the five broken - symmetry generators correspond to one ng boson with a linear dispersion relation , and a doublet of ng bosons with a quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "this agrees with the general counting rules for the ng bosons in lorentz - noninvariant systems @xcite .    at the very end",
    "it should be emphasized once again that the mean - field approximation itself is not sufficient to describe the crossover accurately .",
    "however , the investigation of the spectrum of bosonic collective states that we performed here , is to be understood as a necessary first step towards its systematic improvement .",
