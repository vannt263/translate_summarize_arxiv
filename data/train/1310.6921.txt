    "in a recent work ( see @xcite ) we introduced a method to compare full rankings based on the study of structural properties of a new type of graphs . regarding our proposal ,",
    "any finite set of rankings leads to a graph called _",
    "competitivity graph_. in this paper we analyze the theoretical properties of this graph providing some relationships with some already known families of graphs .",
    "therefore , we are interested more in the tool itself ",
    "the _ competitivity graph _  than in the original focus of the problem  the rankings .",
    "any full ranking of @xmath0 elements can be considered a permutation of @xmath1 .",
    "note that according to this approach it is not possible to consider rankings with ties of two or more elements .",
    "one of the first studies on comparison of full rankings appears in the work of kendall @xcite , where the counting of interchanges between two given rankings plays an essential role . in that seminal paper",
    "the main objective was to introduce a measure of correlation between two rankings  the so - called kendall s measure of correlation .",
    "since then , some papers have been devoted to analyze , compare and extend this coefficient .",
    "for example , in @xcite some metrics to compare rankings can be found .",
    "given some rankings one may be interested in obtaining a consensus ranking : a ranking that _ better _ gathers the information collected in the rankings .",
    "the resulting consensus ranking is also called an aggregated rank , see @xcite .",
    "many studies are devoted to describe techniques for aggregate rankings with an eye on ranking web pages on the internet , see .",
    "e.g. @xcite . the most famous technique to aggregate rankings consists of a markov chain used by the founders of google @xcite . a different approach",
    "consists of finding a permutation that minimizes the crossings over a set of rankings , see @xcite and @xcite for more details on computational complexity .",
    "the concept of _ competitivity graph _ can be considered as a technique of rank aggregation since it is a graph that collects some information ( the crossings ) between pairs of adjacent rankings . when dealing with only two rankings , the _ competitivity graph",
    "_ turns into the well known _",
    "permutation graph _ from graph theory @xcite .",
    "this concept must not be confused with the concept of _ planar permutation graph _ which is a different mathematical object @xcite , @xcite . in this connection",
    "it is necessary to recall that permutation graphs belong to a bigger class of graphs known as _ comparability graphs _ , which is well characterized since the 1960 s ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to highlight that _ comparability graphs _ are also called transitively orientable graphs ( tro ) in the sense that an orientation that preserves transitivity can be set in the graph .",
    "some other papers related to permutation graphs are @xcite , where an algorithm to detect permutation graphs based on testing whether both a graph and its complement are tro graphs is presented , @xcite where an algorithm with a cost of @xmath2 for recognizing permutation graphs is shown , being @xmath3 and @xmath0 the edges and vertices of a graph , respectively , @xcite where a characterization about the connectivity of permutation graphs is provided , and many others ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a new characterization of permutations graph is given in @xcite : the authors introduce the concept of _ cohesive vertex - set order _ based on the connectivity of pairs of vertices to establish a characterization .",
    "we will use this latter characterization as a starting point of some of our analysis on _",
    "competitivity graphs_.    the structure of the paper is the following : after this introduction , section @xmath4 is devoted to introducing some preliminary results and the main definitions , particularly the one of competitivity graphs . in section @xmath5 the relationships among competitivity graphs , comparability graphs and other well known families of graphs are studied .",
    "finally , section @xmath6 is devoted to studying in depth the sets of eventual competitors . moreover ,",
    "an algorithm for computing them directly from the rankings is provided .",
    "given a finite set of elements @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) that we will call _ nodes _ we define a _ ranking _",
    "@xmath9 of @xmath10 as any bijection @xmath11 .",
    "since a ranking is a permutation of the elements of @xmath10 , we can identify rankings with vectors of @xmath12 in the following way : if we take a ranking @xmath11 , we identify @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ,  , @xmath15",

    "given a finite set @xmath21 of rankings we say that the pair of nodes @xmath22 _ compete _ if there exist @xmath23 such that @xmath24 but @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 exchange their relative positions between the rankings @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    the competitiveness between two nodes @xmath28 is strongly related with the fact that @xmath29 is an inversion of a ranking of the family , as the following result shows .",
    "remember that an _ inversion _ in a ranking @xmath9 is a pair of two nodes @xmath29 such that @xmath30    [ equivdef ] given a finite set @xmath21 of rankings , the following conditions are equivalent :    the pair of nodes @xmath29 compete .",

    "_ , once the nodes have been relabeled so that @xmath36 and we have an inversion @xmath29 in ranking @xmath37 , either @xmath18 and @xmath19 exchange their relative positions between @xmath37 and @xmath39 , or @xmath39 also contains the inversion @xmath29 .",
    "the result follows by induction since @xmath40 is a finite set .",
    "if we take a family of rankings @xmath21 we are going to associate it a graph that gives information about the structure of the competitiveness between nodes .",
    "let @xmath21 be a family of rankings of nodes @xmath7 .",
    "we define the _ competitivity graph _ of the family of rankings @xmath40 as the undirected graph @xmath41 , where the set of edges @xmath42 is given by the following rule : there is a link between nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 if @xmath29 compete .",
    "this kind of graphs have already been defined and studied in the particular case of two rankings ( @xmath43 ) .",

    "one of the goals of this paper is showing that there are some deep connections between structural properties of the competitivity graph @xmath56 ( such as connectedness , maximal cliques , ... ) and properties of the rankings and the competitiveness between nodes . as a first example of these relationships we can consider the nodes that compete with a fixed node @xmath57 .    if we take a family of rankings @xmath58 of nodes @xmath7 and we fix @xmath59 , the _ competitivity set _",
    "@xmath60 _ of a node",

    "the sets of competitors are exactly the maximal complete subgraphs ( maximal cliques ) of @xmath56 .",

    "moreover , it can be checked that a set of nodes @xmath63 is a competitors set if and only if @xmath66    the previous remark points out the fact that the maximal cliques of @xmath56 correspond to the sets of competitors . if we consider other structural sets of nodes of @xmath56 , such as the connected components of @xmath56 , we obtain other weaker set of competitors , as the following :    if we take a family of rankings @xmath67 of nodes @xmath7 , we say that a pair of nodes @xmath22 _ eventually compete _ if there exist @xmath68 and nodes @xmath69 such that @xmath70 compete , @xmath71 compete ,  , and @xmath72 compete .    a set of nodes @xmath73",

    "we will follow the notation used in @xcite .",
    "let us start this section by reminding the basic well - known definitions of chordal , comparability and permutation graphs that are the main classic families of graphs that will be compared with the competitivity graphs .",
    "a graph @xmath74 is _ chordal _ if each of its cycles of four or more vertices has a chord , which is an edge joining two nodes that are not adjacent in the cycle .    given any partial ordered set @xmath75 we can associate a directed graph @xmath76 to @xmath75 as defined in @xcite : the vertex set is @xmath10 and there is a link from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , @xmath77 , if @xmath78 .",
    "a graph @xmath74 is a _ comparability graph _ if it is the non - directed graph obtained after removing orientation in @xmath76 for some partial order @xmath79 of @xmath10 .",
    "[ char : compara ] it has been proven @xcite that a graph @xmath74 is a comparability graph if and only if it admits a _ transitive orientation of its edges _ ,",
    "i.e. if there is a directed graph @xmath80 obtained from @xmath81 by orienting each edge in @xmath82 , such that if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 .",
    "comparability graphs are a broadly studied class of graphs , and are related to other families of graphs such as permutation graphs , interval graphs , etc .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we highlight the work of gallai @xcite where the modular decomposition of a graph was introduced as a tool to characterize when a graph is a comparability graph .",
    "a graph @xmath74 is a _ permutation graph _ if its vertices represent the elements of a permutation and each one of its edges correspond to a pair of elements that are reversed by the permutation .",
    "permutation graphs may also be defined geometrically , as the intersection graphs of line segments whose endpoints lie on two parallel lines .",
    "a very useful characterization of permutation graphs is the fact that both the graph @xmath81 and its complement @xmath85 ( the graph with the same set of nodes and links between nodes that are not linked in @xmath81 ) are comparability graphs , i.e. , admit a transitive orientation of its edges , see @xcite .",
    "notice that permutation graphs are both comparability ( by using the last remark ) and competitivity graphs ( simply by considering two rankings : @xmath36 and @xmath86 as the permutation that constitutes the permutation graph ) .",
    "there are several characterizations of permutation graphs , but we point out the following given in terms of _ cohesive vertex - set orders _ ( see @xcite ) .

    "notice that , by using remark  [ char : compara ] , for every comparability graphs there is always a relabeling of the nodes such that satisfies condition  _ ( ii ) _ of definition  [ def : filipina ] ( transitivity ) , since it admits a transitive orientation of its vertices ( in fact , condition  _ ( ii ) _ characterizes comparability graphs ) .",
    "hence we get an alternative proof of the fact that every permutation graph is a comparability graph .    following the essence of the definition of cohesive order ( definition  [ def : filipina ] ) and since condition  _ ( ii ) _ ( transitivity ) characterizes comparability graphs , we can investigate the graphs that verify condition  _ ( i ) _ , introducing the following definition .",
