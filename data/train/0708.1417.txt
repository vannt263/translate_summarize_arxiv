    "most of the recent examples in smooth 4manifold topology have been constructed using the following `` cut - and - paste '' scheme : suppose that the smooth closed 4manifold @xmath1 is decomposed along the embedded 3manifold @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are codimension0 submanifolds of @xmath1 with @xmath5 .",
    "suppose furthermore that @xmath6 is a smooth 4manifold with boundary @xmath7 diffeomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "then a new 4manifold @xmath9 can be constructed by cutting @xmath10 out of @xmath1 and gluing @xmath6 back in .",
    "the topological type of @xmath11 might also depend on the gluing diffeomorphism @xmath12 , but for simplicity we will suppress this dependence in the notation .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 is a tubular neighborhood of a torus of self  intersection 0 and @xmath14 then appropriate choices of @xmath15 give ( generalized ) logarithmic transformations and luttinger surgeries .",
    "the most important topological invariants of a closed smooth 4manifold are the fundamental group @xmath16 , the euler characteristic @xmath17 and the signature @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , in the simply connected case @xmath17 and @xmath18 essentially determine the smooth 4manifold up to homeomorphism @xcite .",
    "the change of @xmath19 and @xmath18 can be very easily determined in a cut - and - paste operation , since these quantitites are additive , while the fundamental group can be computed using the seifert  van kampen theorem .",
    "the determination of the smooth structure is , however , much more complicated .",
    "the most sensitive smooth invariant , the seiberg ",
    "witten function @xmath20 is very hard to compute in general , and although a tqft - type theory ( the monopole floer homology @xcite ) has been developed to compute the seiberg  witten invariants of the result of a cut - and - paste construction , such computations are extremally challenging in practice .",
    "partial knowledge of @xmath21 is provided by taubes famous theorem @xcite , stating that @xmath22 is @xmath23 provided @xmath24 is a symplectic form on @xmath11 ( and @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore we are particularly interested in cut - and - paste constructions which can be performed within the symplectic category .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the following special case of the above cut - and - paste construction : suppose that @xmath26 is a collection of closed symplectic 2dimensional submanifolds of the closed symplectic 4manifold @xmath27 , intersecting each other @xmath28orthogonally according to the plumbing graph @xmath29 . recall that each vertex @xmath30 of the plumbing graph @xmath29 corresponds to a surface ,",
    "hence is decorated by two integers , the genus @xmath31 and the homological square ( or self  intersection ) @xmath32 of the surface , and two verices are connected by @xmath33 edges if and only if the corresponding surfaces intersect each other transversely in @xmath34 ( positive ) points .",
    "we will denote the number of edges emanating from a vertex @xmath30 by @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a tubular neighborhood @xmath36 of the configuration @xmath37 .",
    "assume that @xmath38 is negative definite ( i.e. the corresponding intersection form is negative definite ) , and consider a normal surface singularity @xmath39 with resolution graph @xmath29 .",
    "( it is a result of algebraic geometry @xcite that such @xmath39 exists for every negative definite @xmath38 , although the analytic structure on @xmath40 might not be uniquely determined by @xmath29 . )",
    "suppose finally that @xmath6 is the milnor fiber of a smoothing of the singularity @xmath39 . depending on @xmath41 , such smoothing may or may not exist .",
    "for example , if @xmath41 is a hypersurface singularity ( given by a single equation ) , or more generally it is a complete intersection ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : gen ] ) , then such smoothing always exists .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ t : main ] suppose that @xmath29 is a negative definite plumbing graph which either    1 .",
    "is a tree and has @xmath42 , @xmath43 for all vertices ; or 2 .",
    "@xmath44 holds for every vertex @xmath30 .",
    "suppose furthermore that @xmath45 is a collection of closed symplectic 2dimensional submanifolds of the closed symplectic 4manifold @xmath46 , intersecting each other @xmath28orthogonally according to the plumbing graph @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath41 denote a singularity with resolution graph @xmath29 and @xmath6 the milnor fiber of a smoothing of @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath47 is a closed tubular neighborhood of @xmath48 in @xmath1 , then the 4manifold @xmath49 ( with a suitable , naturally chosen gluing diffeomorphism @xmath15 specified later ) admits a symplectic structure @xmath50 , which can be assumed to agree with the given symplectic structure @xmath51 on @xmath52 .",
    "one way of interpreting this result is the following : consider the singular 4manifold @xmath53 we get by collapsing @xmath48 to a point .",
    "if the singularity of @xmath53 is diffeomorphic to a holomorphic model admitting a smoothing , and @xmath29 satisfies one of the additional hypotheses given in the theorem , then this smoothing can always be `` globalized '' in the symplectic category .",
    "notice that we do not require the singular point to have a holomorphic model in @xmath53 as in @xcite ( where the analytic structure near the singular point is also assumed to be modeled by the holomorphic situation )  we just require the existence of a diffeomorphism . for `` globalizing '' local deformations in the holomorphic category in a similar context , see @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the link @xmath54 of the singularity @xmath39 given by the ( negative definite ) plumbing graph @xmath29 admits a unique ( up to contactomorphism ) milnor fillable contact structure @xmath55 , for which @xmath6 ( with its stein structure originating from the deformation ) provides a stein filling .",
    "in fact , our proof will not use the fact that @xmath6 is a smoothing of @xmath41 .",
    "instead , we will rely on the fact that @xmath6 admits a symplectic structure @xmath56 such that @xmath57 is a strong symplectic filling of @xmath58 . for this reason the chosen analytic structure on @xmath39 is not relevant .    for the convenience of the reader , below we summarize the strategy we will use in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "first we will show that the union @xmath59 of the symplectic surfaces ( of arbitrary genera , intersecting each other @xmath28orthogonally and according to the negative definite graph @xmath29 ) in the symplectic 4manifold @xmath46 admits a compact @xmath28convex neighborhood @xmath60 .",
    "this will be achieved by producing a model symplectic @xmath0-manifold @xmath61 containing a configuration @xmath62 of symplectic surfaces ( intersecting each other @xmath63orthogonally and according to @xmath29 ) , with the same areas and genera as the surfaces in @xmath48 and with a neighborhood system of @xmath63convex neighborhoods of @xmath62 , such that any neighborhood @xmath64 of @xmath65 contains an element of this @xmath66convex neighborhood system .",
    "then a moser type argument shows that any small enough neighborhood @xmath67 is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood @xmath68 of @xmath48 in @xmath69 , and hence @xmath36 contains an @xmath28convex neighborhood @xmath60 . in the construction of @xmath61",
    "we will use simple models for the surfaces which are symbolized by the vertices of the plumbing graph @xmath29 ( similarly to the approach we applied for the central vertex of a starshaped graph in @xcite ) and will apply a toric construction for the edges of @xmath29 ( similarly to the construction along the legs in @xcite ) .",
    "since this construction might be of independent interest , we state it as    [ t : convneighb ] if @xmath70 is a collection of symplectic surfaces in a symplectic 4manifold @xmath46 intersecting each other @xmath28orthogonally according to the negative definite plumbing graph @xmath29 and @xmath71 is an open set containing @xmath48 , then @xmath48 admits an @xmath28convex neighborhood @xmath72 . in particular , the complement @xmath73 is a strong concave filling of its contact boundary .",
    "using grauert s result @xcite it is not hard to show that @xmath48 admits a neighborhood which is a weak symplectic filling of an appropriate contact structure on its boundary .",
    "( a weak filling is one where the symplectic structure is positive on the contact planes on the boundary , as opposed to a strong filling , where the contact structure is induced by a liouville vector field transverse to the boundary . )",
    "therefore the complement of this neighborhood is a weak concave filling , and although in some cases weak convex fillings can be deformed to be strong  @xcite , no similar result for concave fillings is known .",
    "weak fillings , however , are not suitable for the gluing constructions we will apply later , since in the weak case the contact structures do not determine the behavior of the symplectic forms near the boundaries . in the strong case ,",
    "the liouville vector fields allow us to glue symplectic forms when the contact forms agree .",
    "hence we verify the existence of an @xmath28convex neighborhood , providing the desired strong concave filling of the boundary of the appropriate neighborhood .",
    "notice also that in this first step the further assumptions on the plumbing graph @xmath29 ( listed in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of theorem  [ t : main ] ) are not necessary .",
    "after finding the @xmath28convex neighborhood @xmath74 we would like to compare the induced contact structure @xmath75 on @xmath76 to the milnor fillable contact structure @xmath77 on @xmath7 ( given as the 2plane field of complex tangencies on the link ) . to this end we describe an open book decomposition of @xmath78 and ( using a result of @xcite ) relate it to an open book decomposition of the milnor fillable contact structure @xmath79 .",
    "a natural open book decomposition compatible with @xmath80 will be given only under the additional hypothesis that @xmath81 for each vertex @xmath30 of @xmath29 , and the relation to some open book decomposition compatible with @xmath82 will be established in the two cases listed by theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "it is natural to conjecture , however , that these further technical assumptions are unnecessary , hence we state    [ c : main ] the contact structures @xmath80 and @xmath82 are contactomorphic for any negative definite plumbing graph @xmath29 , consequently the symplectic structure @xmath50 on the 4manifold @xmath11 of theorem  [ t : main ] exists for any negative plumbing graph @xmath29 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : gen ] we recall some basics of normal surface singularities . section  [ sec : second ] is devoted to the description of the @xmath28convex neighborhoods of the configuration @xmath83 and hence the proof of theorem  [ t : convneighb ] . in section  [ sec : third ] , under the additional assumption @xmath43 mentioned above , we describe an open book decomposition of @xmath84 compatible with the contact structure induced on the boundary of the @xmath28convex neighborhood , while in section  [ sec : fourth ] we prove theorem  [ t : main ] .",
