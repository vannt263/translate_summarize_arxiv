    "granular fluids are of increasing interest to several scientific communities .",
    "this is partially due to their great relevance in many industrial issues of agricultural , pharmaceutical and chemical significance for packing and transport of grains .",
    "moreover , they raise a number of important conceptual challenges .",
    "a class of these questions , widely investigated in the last two decades or so , involve the form and conditions for a hydrodynamic description , similar to the one for normal , molecular fluids @xcite . in most of the cases , the simplest model of a granular gas at the particle level of description , an ensemble of inelastic hard spheres or disks @xcite ,",
    "is considered .",
    "this model has proven to be able to describe at a qualitative level many of the peculiarities exhibited by real granular gases .    the navier - stokes equation for the energy of a granular gas exhibits two main peculiarities when compared with that for normal fluids .",
    "first , there is a source term associated to the energy dissipation in collisions .",
    "its origin can be easily understood on the basis of mean field arguments .",
    "the other differential feature is the modification of the fourier law for the heat flux , including a new term that couples it to the density gradient .",
    "this new contribution to the heat flux was predicted by kinetic theory methods @xcite , and later on measured in molecular dynamic simulations @xcite . also , some implications of its existence have been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the theoretical formal reasons why this density gradient contribution to the heat flux is present in granular fluids and absent in normal ones has been investigated .",
    "they are related to the time reversal invariance of both the dynamics of the system and the equilibrium distribution function of normal fluids @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "although some physical interpretations of the modification of the fourier law in granular gases have been given , it seems instructive to provide simple intuitive arguments leading to the new term in the fourier law . in particular ,",
    "one of the questions addressed here is to show that mean free path and collision time arguments are enough as to predict the presence of the density gradient contribution to the heat flux for granular fluids , in a similar way as they predict all the transport coefficients in molecular gases , aside from a numerical factor .",
    "another aim of this paper is to discuss a new approximation method to compute navier - stokes transport coefficients of dilute gases starting from their green - kubo representation .",
    "the method is both simple and transparent .",
    "it will be illustrated here for the two coefficients appearing in the modified fourier law .",
    "in the elastic limit the results are the same as those derived by the usual sonine expansion to lowest order , while in the inelastic limit both results are very close .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", the derivation of the generalized fourier law using linear response theory in the context of the boltzmann equation is shortly reviewed .",
    "the relevance of the hydrodynamic part of the spectrum of the linearized boltzmann operator is emphasized .",
    "the formal expressions for the transport coefficients are explicitly evaluated in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] by using an approximation related with the non - hydrodynamic part of the spectrum of the linear boltzmann operator .",
    "the results are shown to be practically equivalent to those that have been obtained by expanding in sonine polynomials keeping only the lowest order .    in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] a much simpler derivation of the modified fourier law is carried out .",
    "it is based on the concepts of mean free time and mean collision time in a dilute gas , generalizing the arguments used in elementary kinetic theory of molecular gases @xcite .",
    "the origin of both contributions to the heat flux , as well as the way in which the inelasticity modifies the usual term proportional to the temperature gradient , show up in a transparent way .",
    "finally , the last section contains a short discussion of some macroscopic effects associated with the new term in the expression of the heat flux .",
    "the specific state considered corresponds to a series of experiements carried out by different groups .",
    "the system considered is a dilute granular gas of smooth inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath0 ) or disks ( @xmath1 ) of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the coefficient of normal restitution @xmath4 will be taken as a velocity - independent constant , although the theory has also been extended to more realistic models in which it depends on the relative velocity of the colliding particles @xcite .",
    "the one - particle distribution function of the system @xmath5 obeys the inelastic nonlinear boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "this equation has a particular solution describing the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the uniform number density , @xmath8 is an isotropic function of the scaled velocity @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the uniform temperature of the system .",
    "it decays monotonically in time according with the haff law , @xmath11 approximated expressions for the distribution @xmath12 and for the cooling rate @xmath13 have been obtained by expanding the function in sonine polynomials and keeping only the lowest order polynomial @xcite .",

    "the interest here is to derive an expression for the heat flux occurring in the system in the direction of the gradients when they are small .",
