    "experimental observation @xcite of the inclusive and exclusive radiative decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 stimulated the study of rare @xmath3 decays on a new footing .",
    "these flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath4 transitions in the standard model ( sm ) do not occur at the tree level and appear only at the loop level .",
    "therefore the study of these rare @xmath3-meson decays can provide a means of testing the detailed structure of the sm at the loop level .",
    "these decays are also very useful for extracting the values of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite , as well as for establishing new physics beyond the sm @xcite .    currently , the main interest on rare @xmath3-meson decays is focused on decays for which the sm predicts large branching ratios and can be potentially measurable in the near future .",
    "the rare and @xmath5 decays are such decays .",
    "the experimental situation for these decays is very promising @xcite , with @xmath6 and hadron colliders focusing only on the observation of exclusive modes with @xmath7 and @xmath8 final states , respectively . at quark level",
    "the process @xmath9 takes place via electromagnetic and z penguin and w box diagrams and are described by three independent wilson coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "investigations allow us to study different structures , described by the above mentioned wilson coefficients . in the sm ,",
    "the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry and invariant dilepton mass distribution in @xmath12 provide information on the short distance contributions dominated by the top quark loops and are essential in separating the short distance fcnc process from the contributing long distance effects @xcite and also are very sensitive to the contributions from new physics @xcite .",
    "recently it has been emphasized by hewett @xcite that the longitudinal lepton polarization , which is another parity violating observable , is also an important asymmetry and that the lepton polarization in @xmath13 will be measurable with the high statistics available at the b - factories currently under construction .",
    "in calculating the branching ratios and other observables in hadron level , i.e. for decay , we have the problem of computing the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian , @xmath14 , between the states @xmath3 and @xmath15 .",
    "this problem is related to the non - perturbative sector of qcd .",
    "these matrix elements , in the framework of different approaches such as chiral theory @xcite , three point qcd sum rules method @xcite , relativistic quark model by the light - front formalism @xcite , have been investigated .",
    "the aim of this work is the calculation of these matrix elements in light cone qcd sum rules method and to study the lepton polarization asymmetry for the exclusive decays .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath9 decay , including qcd corrections [ 1214 ] can be written as _ eff = v_tb v^*_ts _ i=1 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i ( )  , which is evolved from the electroweak scale down to @xmath16 by the renormalization group equations . here",

    "note that the function @xmath25 contains both real and imaginary parts ( the imaginary part arises when the c - quark in the loop is on the mass shell ) .",
    "the decay also receives large long distance contributions from the cascade process @xmath26 .",
