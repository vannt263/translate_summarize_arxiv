    "formation history of galaxies is basically understood as a combination of two fundamental evolutionary processes , i.e. , production of stars and accumulation of dark matter in the standard framework of galaxy formation which is the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models . in order to investigate the formation history of stars , one of the fundamental processes ,",
    "many efforts have been made for searching for high-@xmath8 galaxies up to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "very deep optical - to - near infrared imaging data such as the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) pioneered to detect high-@xmath8 galaxies at @xmath32 .",
    "the photometric - redshift ( photo-@xmath8 ) method accurately identifies the redshifts of all high-@xmath8 galaxies detected in the imaging data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the photo-@xmath8 method has an advantage in identifying high-@xmath8 galaxies with little systematic selection bias .",
    "however , the photo-@xmath8 method requires near - infrared images deep enough to detect faint high-@xmath8 galaxies , as well as multi - band optical images .",
    "thus , application of this technique is limited to small patches of the sky and to small numbers of galaxies at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath33 ) , due to the small field - of - view of near - infrared imagers to date . on the other hand",
    ", the broad - band two color selection technique successfully identifies a large number of high-@xmath8 galaxies detected only in optical bands , which is based on lyman - break ( @xmath34 ) features redshifted to optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies found by this method are called lyman break galaxies , or lbgs .",
    "there are a few thousand of photometrically selected high-@xmath8 ( @xmath35 ) galaxies , and about 1000 galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed to be really located at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the lyman break technique is an ideal method for selecting a large number of high-@xmath8 galaxies and for studying their general properties in a limited telescope time , since the method requires optical images in a few bandpasses .",
    "furthermore , relative sensitivities in optical bands are better than those in near - infrared , and thus the lyman break technique can identify higher - redshift ( @xmath37 ) galaxies than the photo-@xmath8 method .",
    "a problem is that lbgs are generally uv - continuum bright galaxies , since they are identified by their strong lyman breaks .",
    "it is thought that part of high-@xmath8 galaxies escape from the lyman break selection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "care is needed when we discuss properties of high-@xmath8 galaxies using lbg samples .",
    "luminosity function ( lf ) of high-@xmath8 galaxies are obtained to reveal the number density and the star - formation history of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sds iii ) ) .",
    "@xcite find from their large lbg samples that the lf of lbgs at @xmath18 is well fitted by the schechter function with a steep slope , @xmath38 , down to @xmath39 , and that the uv - luminosity density derived by integrating the lf does not change from @xmath18 to @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the cosmic star - formation rate ( sfr ) estimated from the uv - luminosity density does not significantly drop at @xmath32 , which is different from the early report given by @xcite with hdf - n galaxies .",
    "a similar tendency in the cosmic sfr is also reported by @xcite who derive the cosmic sfr at @xmath21 . here",
    ", dust extinction is a critical issue in estimating the cosmic sfr from the uv - luminosity density .",
    "dust extinction of lbgs at @xmath25 has been estimated by @xcite ( see also @xcite for review ) from uv spectral slopes of lbgs .",
    "these authors show that the average ( or median ) dust extinction of lbgs at @xmath25 is @xmath40 , assuming the dust attenuation law of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "global spectral fitting from rest - frame uv to optical seds of lbgs at @xmath25 supports this value @xcite .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy has also yielded similar values of dust extinction using the balmer decrement ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since the dust - extinction correction for",
    "the uv - luminosity ranges from a factor of 3 to 19 ( presented in @xcite and references therein ) , it is a key to determine dust extinction accurately , so as to estimate the real sfr from the uv - luminosity density .    measuring the stellar mass density",
    "@xcite is an independent check for cosmic sfr measurements , since the cosmic sfr is a derivative of the stellar mass density with respect to cosmic time .",
    "@xcite have derived the stellar mass density as a function of redshift up to @xmath18 .",
    "they have found that the stellar mass density at @xmath18 is about 6% of that in the present epoch . however , the stellar mass density at @xmath18 they have estimated is less than that derived by integrating the cosmic sfr given by @xcite ( see @xcite ) , where the cosmic sfr at high redshift ( @xmath41 ) is an extrapolation from measurements at @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to obtain accurate cosmic sfrs at @xmath43 , and examine the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "galaxies produce far - uv photons by their star - formation activities , and these far - uv photons contribute to the ionization of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is also important to measure the star - formation activity of high-@xmath8 galaxies , and investigate the relationship between galaxies and the reionization of the universe .",
    "observational studies of galaxies at @xmath37 were mainly based on data of the hdf - n and hdf - sourth , both of which have only @xmath44 arcmin@xmath2 ( about @xmath45 ) , corresponding to @xmath46 mpc@xmath2 at @xmath13 ( comoving units ) , i.e. , cluster scales in the present - day universe . surveys based on such a small area probably suffer from cosmic variance , i.e. , spatial inhomogeneities of galaxy properties in the universe . cosmic variance is thought to be one of the major ambiguities in the measurements for luminosity function , luminosity density , and star - formation rate etc .",
    "furthermore , small - field surveys do not provide clustering properties of galaxies on large scales which reflect properties of dark matter in galaxies , i.e. , the other fundamental properties of galaxies .    in order to address the issues described above",
    ", we carry out deep and wide - field surveys for high-@xmath8 galaxies with subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; @xcite ) , which is a wide - field ( @xmath47 ) optical imager mounted on 8 m subaru .",
    "we made deep and wide - field imaging for two blank fields during the guaranteed time observations ( gtos ) of suprime - cam .",
    "one blank field is the subaru deep field ( sdf : @xmath48,@xmath49[j2000 ] ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sds i ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sds ii ) ; sds iii ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "2004 in preparation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these fields have little galactic extinction and few bright stars over 1 deg@xmath2 .",
    "thus , these fields are suitable for studying high-@xmath8 galaxies by deep observations with suprime - cam . these two blank fields , sdf and sxdf ,",
    "have also been observed in two subaru observatory key projects .",
    "one is the sdf project ( kashikawa et al . ) .",
    "the sdf project makes very deep observations for the sdf with suprime - cam , multi - slit spectrographs ( e.g. , subaru / focas : @xcite ) , and near - infrared cameras and spectrographs ( e.g. , subaru / cisco : @xcite ) , to study galaxy evolution at @xmath52 . the area surveyed in the sdf project is about 0.2 deg@xmath2 , corresponding to one fov of suprime - cam .",
    "the other is the subaru / xmm deep survey ( sxds ) project ( sekiguchi et al . ) .",
    "the sxds project is a wide - field multi - wavelength survey project .",
    "the field surveyed by suprime - cam in the sxds project is about 1 deg@xmath2 corresponding to 5 fovs of suprime - cam .",

    "this paper is based on the gto data alone , which were taken in 2000 and 2001 .",
    "deeper images ( 3 - 10 hours for each band ) have been obtained in the key projects , but reduction of them is still under way . and @xmath7 data presented in @xcite were taken in the gtos . ]    in this paper , we make large samples of lbgs at @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the deep and wide - field sdf+sxdf data ( sections [ sec : observations]-[sec : photometric ] ) .",
    "we derive lfs of lbgs from the large lbg samples , and investigate the evolution of the lf ( section [ sec : luminosity ] ) .",
    "we calculate dust extinction for our lbgs at @xmath13 , and examine the evolution of dust extinction for star - forming galaxies over @xmath53 ( section [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "we calculate the uv - luminosity density of lbgs at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and investigate the cosmic sfr , the stellar mass density , and the escape fraction of far - uv photons for lbgs at @xmath54 ( section [ sec : evolution ] ) where we use the dust extinction of lbgs obtained in the previous section .",
    "we present clustering properties of these lbgs in the companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sds vi ) . in sds vi",
    ", we combine the results of clustering properties with those of photometric properties shown in this paper using the cdm models , and give more detailed discussions .    throughout this paper , magnitudes are in the ab system @xcite .",

    "these values are the same as those obtained from the latest cmb observations @xcite .",
    "during the commissioning runs of suprime - cam ( november 2000 - november 2001 ) , we carried out multi - band , deep and wide - field optical imaging in two blank fields .",
    "one is the subaru deep field ( sdf : @xmath48,@xmath49[j2000 ] ; sds i ) , and the other is the subaru / xmm deep field ( sxdf : @xmath50,@xmath56[j2000 ] ) .",
    "the central 4 arcmin@xmath2 region of the sdf has very deep @xmath57 and @xmath58 data ( sds i ) .",
    "although the central position of the sxdf is @xmath50,@xmath59 ( j2000 ) ( sekiguchi et al . 2004 in preparation ) , since some bright stars are located in the neighbor of the central position , we choose a southern part of the sxdf which is apart from the center by @xmath60 for our observations .",
    "we observed these two blank fields in the @xmath3- , @xmath4-,@xmath5- , @xmath6- , and @xmath7-band filters which cover the whole optical - wavelength range ( 4000  to 10000 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : response_bvriz ] shows the response of the filters used in these observations .",
    "the response includes atmospheric absorption , quantum efficiency , and transmittance of optical elements of suprime - cam .",

    "[ fig : color_sxdf ] , the upper right corner , where no data exist , corresponds to the position of the w93c2 . ] in addition , one ccd named w67c1 installed in april 2001 showed strong fringes , and we do not use the data taken by this ccd .",
    ", the region in the lower left corner corresponds to the position of the w67c1 .",
    "] we do not use , either , low - s / n regions located around the edge of the fov , which are caused by dithering observations .",
    "after we reject these bad areas , the sxdf image has 653 arcmin@xmath2 for all bandpasses .",
    "similarly , the sdf image has 616 arcmin@xmath2 for the @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath6 , and @xmath7 bands , and 543 arcmin@xmath2 for the @xmath5 band ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .    during the observations , we took images of photometric standard stars , sa92 and sa95 @xcite in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bands , and spectrophotometric standard stars , sa95 - 42 and hz44 @xcite in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands .",
    "these standard stars were observed a few times a night , when the night was thought to be photometric .",
    "spectroscopic redshift data are important to check our selection criteria for lbgs .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic follow - up observations of lbgs detected in our data with faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) on subaru on june 6 , 2002 .",
    "we used one multi - slit mask containing slits for 4 lbg candidates .",
    "we also observed 5 objects selected by other criteria including lyman @xmath26 emitter ( lae ) candidates at @xmath67 ( sds iv ) .",
    "thus , the number of galaxies for which we took spectra is @xmath68 .",
    "we chose the 300 line mm@xmath12 grating with a dispersion of 1.4   pixel@xmath12 and a wavelength coverage of 4700 - 9400 .",
    "the sensitivity decreases in blue wavelengths ( @xmath69 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted a slit width of @xmath70 , which gave a spectral resolution of 9.8 .",
    "we made 2 hr exposure for each object .",
    "the seeing size of the night was @xmath71 .",
    "the continuum flux limit of our spectra was @xmath72 erg s@xmath12 @xmath73 @xmath12 with the @xmath74 significance level .",
    "in addition to these nine spectra , we use 76 spectra given by sds iii which were taken during the guaranteed time observations of focas in 2001 .",
    "the details of the spectra are described in section [ sec : photometric_lbg_definitions ] .",
    "we develop the pipeline software , sdfred , @xcite to reduce suprime - cam data .",
    "the core programs of sdfred are taken from iraf , sextractor @xcite , and the mosaic - ccd data reduction software @xcite .",
    "sdfred includes a set of optimized parameters which are common to any suprime - cam data , and it accepts free parameters dependent on conditions of data .",
    "this pipeline software is open to the public , and a manual of the software and instructions for installation are given in @xcite .",
    "we reduce all the observed data of good quality with sdfred , and make stacked images for all bandpasses .",
    "we align these stacked images using hundreds of stellar objects in each image .",
    "then , we smooth the images with gaussian kernels to match their seeing sizes .",
    "the final images have a psf fwhm of @xmath75 ( sdf ) and @xmath76 ( sxdf ) .",
    "we calculate photometric zero - points from photometry of standard stars with a @xmath77 aperture ( hereafter @xmath78 indicates the diameter of a circular aperture ) .",
    "we use the zero - points obtained in photometric nights with airmass correction @xcite .",
    "we check these photometric zero points using colors of 175 galactic stars calculated from spectra given in @xcite .",
    "since the fov of suprime - cam is large enough to detect more than 100 bright stars with @xmath79 , we can examine the photometric zero - points using various two - color diagrams .",
    "we find that the colors of stellar objects in our data are consistent with those of @xcite s stars , except for some two - color diagrams in which an offset of @xmath80 mag is seen .",
    "such offsets are probably due to photometric errors of standard stars observed in slightly non - photometric conditions .",
    "we correct the zero points by about @xmath80 mag , so that the observed colors of stellar objects match the synthetic colors of @xcite s stars .",
    "the photometric - zero points thus obtained are regarded as more accurate than 0.05 mag .",
    "source detection and photometry are performed using sextractor version 2.1.6 @xcite .",
    "we measure both mag_auto of sextractor and @xmath81 aperture magnitudes ; a @xmath81 aperture diameter is twice as large as the seeing size , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the sdf and sxdf data , respectively . in order to obtain faint psf - like objects with a good signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we do not adopt mag_auto as total magnitudes .",
    "instead , we use for total magnitudes @xmath81 aperture magnitudes after applying an aperture correction of 0.2 magnitude .",
    "we present in section [ sec : photometric_lbg_definitions ] the difference between mag_auto and @xmath81 aperture magnitudes after aperture correction .",
    "we make @xmath6- and @xmath7-detection catalogs for both the sdf and the sxdf data .",
    "we limit the catalogs to @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) for the @xmath6- and @xmath7-detection catalogs of the sdf ( sxdf ) , in order to provide a reasonable level of photometric completeness .",
    "these limiting magnitudes are defined for a @xmath88 diameter aperture .",
    "our @xmath6-detection and @xmath7-detection catalogs contain 45,923 ( 39,301 ) and 37,486 ( 34,024 ) objects for the sdf ( sxdf ) , respectively .",
    "we correct the magnitudes of objects for galactic extinction , @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite for the sdf and sxdf , respectively .",
    "we measure @xmath61 limiting magnitudes of the images , which are defined as the 3 @xmath91 levels of sky noise on a @xmath81 diameter . for each image , we measure sky counts in a number of @xmath88-diameter circular apertures which are located at randomly selected positions in the image . then , we draw a histogram of the sky counts , and fit a gaussian function to the histogram to obtain a @xmath92 noise .",
    "when we fit a gaussian function , we omit the positive tail of the histogram which is affected by objects .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are presented in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "note that we did not simply calculate the @xmath61 limiting magnitudes by scaling a @xmath92 noise in one pixel to a @xmath88 diameter area .",
    "since this simple scaling results in a very optimistic limiting magnitude as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , we use the real noise values measured in @xmath81 apertures .",
    "since we correct geometric distortion of images through the data reduction , relative astrometry is good enough for this work .",
    "relative error is less than 1 pixel ( @xmath93/pixel ) .",
    "however , we need to obtain absolute astrometry for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "we calibrate coordinates of objects using faint objects ( @xmath94 ) given in usno a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "although positional accuracies of usno objects are not so good ( typically @xmath95 ) , there are no other calibrators which are faint enough ( so that they are not saturated in our images ) .",
    "we use 136 ( 97 ) usno objects which are not saturated in the @xmath3-band image in the sdf ( sxdf ) .",
    "they are uniformly distributed over the images .",
    "we obtain the absolute coordinates of our objects with these usno objects .",
    "the errors in the absolute positions of objects in @xmath96 are estimated to be less than @xmath97 arcsec both in the sdf and in the sxdf .",
    "we make three photometric samples of lbgs by the following two - color selections .",
    "the first sample is for lbgs at @xmath15 selected by @xmath101 vs. @xmath102 .",
    "they are referred to as @xmath98-lbgs .",
    "@xmath98-lbgs are galaxies whose lyman break enters into the @xmath3 band and whose flat uv continuum is sampled in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , and these galaxies are identified by their red @xmath101 and blue @xmath102 colors .",
    "similarly , the second is for lbgs at @xmath28 selected by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and we refer to them as @xmath99-lbgs .",
    "the third is for lbgs at @xmath28 selected by @xmath102 and @xmath104 , and we refer to them as @xmath100-lbgs .    for @xmath105 objects , the uv continuum shortward of 1216  is damped by the ly@xmath26 absorption of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) . since the depression at 1216  is as strong as that at 912  ( lyman break ) for galaxies at @xmath37 ,",
    "lbgs identified by the above two - color selections are not `` lyman break '' galaxies but `` lyman break + ly@xmath26 absorption '' galaxies in reality .",
    "the central redshift of these samples is shifted toward lower redshifts than the one calculated by dividing the central wavelength of the bluest band by 912 .",
    "for example , @xmath100-lbgs are expected to be located around at @xmath106 , but the actual redshifts are @xmath107 ( section [ sec : photometric_lbg_completeness ] )",
    ".    figures [ fig : cc_bri_model]-[fig : cc_riz_model ] illustrate how to isolate lbgs from foreground objects including galactic stars .",
    "these figures indicate that lbgs can be isolated from low-@xmath8 galaxies and galactic stars by their red break colors ( @xmath101 , @xmath103 , and @xmath102 ) and their blue continuum colors ( @xmath102 , @xmath104 , and @xmath104 ) . in order to define the selection criteria for lbgs quantitatively , and estimate the sample completeness and contamination , we use 85 spectroscopically identified objects in our fields and 1048 galaxies in the photometric redshift catalog of hdf - n given by @xcite as explained in the following .",
    "our 85 spectroscopically identified objects come from two sources .",
    "one is the sample of 9 objects for which we carried out spectroscopic follow - up observations and the other is the spectroscopic catalog of 76 sdf objects compiled by sds iii .",
    "the nine spectra are ( i ) 4 lbg candidates whose colors are close to those of model galaxies at @xmath108 ( figures [ fig : cc_bri_model]-[fig : cc_riz_model ] ) and ( ii ) 5 objects including lae candidates of sds ii ( see sds iv ) .",
    "we identify that these 4 lbg candidates are real lbgs at @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ( these are sdfj132413.3 + 274207 , sdfj132416.3 + 274355 , sdfj132413.1 + 274116 , and sdfj132410.5 + 274254 in figure [ fig : spec_lbg ] ) . in the 76 spectra , there are two lbgs at @xmath108 : @xmath113 and @xmath114 .. however , one galaxy at @xmath115 has spectroscopic features similar to late - type stars .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of this object is bright , @xmath116 , and its profile is stellar .",
    "therefore , we regard this object as a galactic star .",
    "another lbg at @xmath117 is blended in our image , and we can not detect this lbg as a single object .",
    "thus , we use the remaining two lbgs for our analysis . ] in summary , we have 85 ( @xmath118 ) spectroscopically identified objects at @xmath119 , and 6 among them are found to be lbgs at @xmath108 . out of the rest ( 79 objects )",
    ", three are lbgs at @xmath120 , four are laes at @xmath67 which are only detected in a narrow - band image ( sds ii ) , and the other 72 objects are either blue dwarf galaxies with emission lines , or red late - type galaxies up to at @xmath121 , or late - type galactic stars . figure [ fig : spec_lbg ] shows the spectra and snap shots of the identified 6 lbgs , and table [ tab : lbgs_with_redshifts ] summarizes their properties .",
    "we compare colors of galaxies in our lbg samples with colors of the 85 spectroscopically identified objects .",
    "the 85 spectroscopically identified objects are plotted on the two - color diagrams in figures [ fig : cc_bri_obssim2]-[fig : cc_riz_obssim2 ] ; blue circles are for interlopers and red circles are for lbgs at @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for @xmath98-lbgs , @xmath99-lbgs , and @xmath100-lbgs , respectively .",
    "as expected , spectroscopically identified high-@xmath8 galaxies are located in the upper - left part of the two - color diagrams .",
    "we define the selection criteria for lbgs , so that the criteria select lbgs with a reasonably high completeness and with a low contamination from interlopers .",
    "since the number of spectroscopically confirmed objects is very small ( especially for high-@xmath8 galaxies ) , we determine the selection criteria of lbgs by simulations .",
    "we use the best - fit seds of objects in the hdf - n photometric redshift catalog given by @xcite .",
    "the hdf - n catalog is an appropriate catalog to be compared with our data , since it contains a number of galaxies at @xmath125 calibrated with spectroscopic identifications .",
    "another advantage of the hdf - n catalog is that it has not only blue ( in uv continuum ) galaxies but also red ( in uv continuum ) galaxies which usually escape from lyman break selection criteria .",
    "we already show in figures [ fig : cc_bri_model]-[fig : cc_riz_model ] colors of the 1048 hdf - n galaxies which are calculated by convolving the best - fit seds with the response functions of the suprime - cam filters . since the colors of these hdf - n galaxies are calculated from the best - fit seds , they are free from random photometric noise",
    ". the colors of objects in our catalogs , on the other hand , include random errors whose amplitudes are dependent on apparent magnitudes and local sky fluctuations .",
    "so as to evaluate these random errors , we generate artificial galaxies that mimic the hdf - n galaxies , and distribute them randomly on our original images after adding poisson noise according to their original brightness .",
    "then , we detect these simulated objects and measure their brightness in the same manner as for our photometric catalogs ( section [ sec : observations_data_photometriccatalogs ] ) .",
    "we iterate this process 100 times and derive probability maps of the detected objects in two - color diagrams .",
    "we define low-@xmath8 interlopers as galaxies whose redshifts are lower than @xmath18 in the original photometric - redshift catalog . in figures [ fig :",
    "cc_bri_obssim2]-[fig : cc_riz_obssim2 ] , we show the probability maps of the low-@xmath8 interlopers , i.e. , probability maps of contamination , thus obtained . to derive probability maps of high-@xmath8 galaxies , we carry out additional simulations since the number of high-@xmath8 galaxies in furusawa et al.s ( 2000 ) catalog is not large ( 52 galaxies at @xmath126 ) .",
    "here , high-@xmath8 galaxies are defined as galaxies whose redshifts are close to the expected central redshift given by the color selection for each of the three lbg samples . assuming that the color distribution found for the high-@xmath8 galaxies in the hdf - n catalog is universal and independent of @xmath6 ( and @xmath7 ) magnitude , we make a mock catalog of 1648 galaxies at @xmath127 whose @xmath6- or @xmath7-band magnitudes are scaled from 23.0 mag to 27.0 mag with a 0.5-magnitude interval .",
    "then we distribute these galaxies on our original images and detect them in the same manner as for the estimation of low-@xmath8 interlopers .",

    "similarly , our simulations show that the criteria select about half of the galaxies at @xmath67 ( see figure [ fig : completeness_comb ] ) . in summary , we can well estimate the completeness of high-@xmath8 galaxies as a function of redshift from our simulations .",

    "the boundary of selection criteria of @xcite is very close to the colors of elliptical galaxies at @xmath143 ; the separation between the boundary and the colors of foreground galaxies is only about @xmath144 magnitude in @xmath142 . in reality , the two - color diagram of @xcite shows that their criteria select a number of objects from the outskirts of low-@xmath8 objects color sequence in the brightest magnitude range ( @xmath145 ; figure 2 ( d ) of @xcite ) .",

    "the implicit assumption here is that high-@xmath8 galaxies are ideally characterized by their lyman breaks and flat - uv continuum features .",

    "the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is about one order in number density at @xmath209 .",
    "since the luminosity at 1700 is approximately proportional to the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , the observed decrease in bright lbgs with @xmath209 probably indicates that galaxies with high star - formation activity ( sfr@xmath212 and @xmath213yr@xmath12 for with and without extinction correction : details are described in section [ sec : discussions ] ) are rarer at @xmath21 .",

    "however , we find an excellent consistency between the lfs derived from the sdf and the sxdf . thus the field variance is probably not the main reason for this discrepancy .",
    "second , it is possible that the selection criteria of @xcite would take a large number of contaminants in their lbg sample as discussed in section [ sec : photometric_lbg_definitions ] , resulting in the larger number density of bright lbgs than by ours .",
    "we estimate the star - formation rate of bright lbgs with @xmath357 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : starformationrate ] to be @xmath359yr@xmath12 ( see the upper abscissa axis of figure [ fig : lumifun_comb_sfr ] for the correspondence between @xmath360 and @xmath361 ) .",
    "since the uv luminosity of these lbgs has dust extinction of @xmath362 , the extinction corrected sfr is about a factor of 4 larger than @xmath361 ( section [ sec : dust_dust ] ) .",
    "thus lbgs with @xmath357 have intrinsic @xmath363 of @xmath11yr@xmath12 .",
    "the deficit of @xmath357 lbgs at @xmath21 indicates that the number density of galaxies with high - star formation rate of @xmath11yr@xmath12 drops from @xmath13 to @xmath21 .",
    "our lfs are derived for uv - luminosity or , equivalently , star - formation rate . in general , galaxies with larger sizes and higher star - formation efficiencies have higher star - formation rates .",
    "thus , our findings imply that large galaxies are formed by subsequent mergers of small galaxies and/or that star - formation efficiency increases from @xmath21 to @xmath18 .",
    "the former interpretation supports the picture of hierarchical clustering ( e.g. , @xcite ) in which galaxies experience a number of mergers . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter interpretation is not consistent with predictions from numerical simulations of hierarchical clustering . since the cooling efficiency increases with the density of gas in dark halos",
    ", hot gas cools more efficiently at higher redshifts , resulting in a higher star - formation efficiency at a higher redshift @xcite , which is opposite to the observed evolution .",
    "thus , a decrease in the number density of dark halos predicted by the former scenario should explain the observed evolution of the lf at bright magnitudes .",
    "we calculate the cumulative number density of massive dark halos down to @xmath364 , where lbgs with @xmath365 are expected to reside ( see the companion paper , sds vi ) , and find that the number density of these massive halos is 44% ( at @xmath13 ) and 16% ( at @xmath21 ) of that at @xmath18 .",

    "@xcite report that the faint - end slope of the lf for lbgs at @xmath367 may be as steep as @xmath368 from their deep hst / acs data .",
    "thus , the slope of the lf for lbgs may steepen at @xmath37 . however , these results might conflict with model predictions .",
    "the number density of faint galaxies is predicted to decrease right after the reionization ( @xmath367 ; @xcite ) , since the reionization increases the jeans mass of the igm and thus the minimum mass of forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the average extinction of lbgs at @xmath13 , @xmath17 , is the same as that of lbgs at @xmath18 derived by @xcite from their large sample of @xmath18 lbgs .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of extinction on intrinsic luminosity for @xmath13 lbgs is similar to that for @xmath18 lbgs .",
    "this means that the average dust properties are the same between @xmath18 lbgs and @xmath13 lbgs .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that most of the lbgs seen at @xmath18 started star formation after @xmath13 , i.e. , lbgs at @xmath18 are not descendants of lbgs at @xmath13 .",
    "thus , lbgs at @xmath18 and @xmath13 may be similarly young , and so have a similar amount of dust .",
    "we compare in figure [ fig : madauplot ] the luminosity densities of lbgs at @xmath54 in our samples with those at @xmath18 and 4 which are calculated from the lfs given in @xcite .",

    "although the number density of bright lbgs ( @xmath357 ) significantly decreases toward @xmath21 ( figure [ fig : lumifun_comb_sfr ] ) , the total uv - luminosity density does not change largely .",

    "the ratio of the uv - luminosity density of laes to that of lbgs is @xmath376 at @xmath28 .",
    "since lbg samples are uv - luminosity limited samples ( section [ sec : photometric_lbg_galaxies ] ) , the uv - luminosity density derived from lbgs lf represents the uv - luminosity density of the whole galaxy population ( if an appropriate extrapolation of the lf down to a very faint luminosity is made ) .",

    "on the other hand , @xcite have found no lyman - continuum flux in their two lbgs at @xmath18 , and they set an upper limit for the escape fraction of @xmath392 .",
    "the measurement of @xcite is not consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss that this inconsistency may be due to differences in sample selection . in either case ,",
    "our estimate , @xmath354 , is not seriously conflict with these two previous measurements , if the escape fraction does not change from @xmath21 to @xmath18 .",
    "the escape fraction of lbgs is probably not smaller than @xmath170 .",
    "we compare these @xmath344 values with those of the present - day galaxies .",

    "@xcite have found @xmath401 for ngc 3067 .",
    "the escape fraction of the milky way galaxy has been estimated to be @xmath402 by @xcite .",
    "the average @xmath344 seems to be @xmath403 for present - day galaxies .",
    "this implies that the escape fraction of lbgs at @xmath355 is larger than that of star - forming galaxies at @xmath30 .",
    "we have made large samples of 2,600 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 detected in deep ( @xmath404 ) and wide - field ( 1,200 arcmin@xmath2 ) data of the subaru deep field ( sdf ) and the subaru / xmm deep field ( sxdf ) , and have studied their photometric properties .",
    "the major findings of our study are summarized as follows .",
    "we find that our selection criteria for lbgs can isolate about 90% of all galaxies in a targetted redshift range , if galaxies have sufficiently high @xmath405 ratios ( figure [ fig : photzhist_comb ] in section [ sec : photometric_lbg_galaxies ] ) .",
    "thus , our lbg samples are regarded as nearly uv - magnitude limited samples of high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "the missed 10% galaxies are galaxies attenuated heavily by dust ( @xmath9 ) .    \\2 .",
    "we derive luminosity functions of lbgs at @xmath406 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 in section [ sec : luminosity ] .",
    "we find no cosmic variance between the sdf and the sxdf . then comparing them with that at @xmath407 @xcite",
    ", we find that while the luminosity function of lbgs does not show a large change over @xmath18 and @xmath19 as reported by @xcite , the number density of bright galaxies with @xmath10 ( or galaxies with high star - formation rate of @xmath380 yr@xmath12 with extinction correction ) decreases by an order of magnitude from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we also find that the faint - end slope of the luminosity function may be steeper at @xmath13 than at @xmath18 .",
    "we estimate the dust extinction of lbgs at @xmath408 from the uv - continuum slope measured from @xmath104 color ( section [ sec : dust ] ) . we do not measure dust extinction of lbgs at @xmath409 , because @xmath104 measurements are significantly affected by absorption of the igm and by ly@xmath26 emission ( figure [ fig : redshift_beta ] of section [ sec : dust_uv ] ) .",
    "we find that lbgs with @xmath16 have @xmath279 on average if completeness correction is made to the sample , and that the amount of extinction depends not on apparent luminosity but on intrinsic luminosity .",
    "we find no evolution in dust extinction between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we calculate the uv - luminosity density at 1700  for our lbgs by integrating the luminosity functions derived in section [ sec : luminosity_lbg ]",
    ". then we estimate the cosmic star - formation rate at @xmath13 and @xmath21 from the uv - luminosity density , and compare them with those at @xmath410 given by various authors .",
    "we find that the uv - luminosity density at 1700 , @xmath20 , does not significantly change from @xmath18 to @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "comparing the uv - luminosity density of lbgs at @xmath21 with that of lyman @xmath26 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath67 calculated from the data of sds ii , we obtain @xmath376 .",
    "it implies that about a half ( @xmath27% ) of the star formation at @xmath107 occurs in laes .",
    "we derive the cosmic star - formation rate ( sfr ) at @xmath411 and 5 from @xmath20 of our lbgs ( section [ sec : evolution_star ] ) with correction for dust extinction of @xmath312 obtained in section [ sec : dust_dust ] . combining our measurements with those at @xmath412 given in the literature , we find that the cosmic sfr is almost constant , or shows a possible decline , from @xmath18 to @xmath21 .",
    "we then estimate the stellar mass density at @xmath413 by integrating the cosmic sfr over time , and find that at @xmath414 the stellar mass density based on the cosmic sfr exceeds that derived directly from the stellar mass function by a factor of 3 , while the two estimates agree at @xmath415 .",
    "we estimate the production rate of ionizing photons for lbgs from @xmath20 using the model proposed by @xcite ( section [ sec : evolution_contribution ] ) .",
    "we find that more than @xmath416% of ionizing photons produced by massive stars should escape from lbgs at @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath354 ) in order to keep the igm ionized .",
