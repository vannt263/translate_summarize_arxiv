    "forbidden line components are atomic transitions with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angular quantum number .",
    "they are associated with the mixing of upper states induced by the plasma electric microfield , leading to transitions that are normally disallowed by the selection rules for electric dipole transitions .",
    "this effect should not be confused with forbidden lines associated with magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole or other higher multipole transitions which are well known tools for analysing emission lines from thin astrophysical plasmas , e.g. , a multitude of forbidden lines in planetary nebulae @xcite and he - like triplets in x - ray spectra of stellar coronae @xcite .",
    "the forbidden line components investigated here are not restricted to low densities because they do not involve metastable states .",
    "in contrast , they appear as absorption lines at high densities when line broadening by the stark effect is important .",
    "the most prominent example for numerous forbidden components are neutral helium lines in optical spectra of white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , originally detected in b - type stars by @xcite at  @xmath34471 .",
    "this @xmath4 transition is accompanied by the forbidden @xmath5 component @xmath6 .",
    "detailed descriptions of the physical process associated with the formation of forbidden components in neutral helium can be found , e.g. , in .    to our best knowledge",

    "* ) in plasmas where helium with its forbidden components is not present for that purpose .",
    "the first to investigate the presence of forbidden line components in stellar spectra was , as mentioned , @xcite .",
    "he wrote : `` of the various elements only helium seems to promise any results .",
    "hydrogen shows no new lines outside the balmer components , which are blended .",
    "all other elements are either faint in the stars or not very susceptible to stark effect . ''    at last we can report here on the detection of forbidden line components of a heavier species , namely carbon in stellar spectra .",
    "they occur in hot ( pre- ) white dwarfs , namely , the same two transitions discovered in the plasma experiment by @xcite .",
    "the detection is favored by the conditions encountered in hot white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "broad lines due to strong stark effect and , often , highly enriched carbon abundance .",
    "because of the strong density dependence of the line strengths , they can potentially be used as sensitive gravity indicators in stellar spectra .",
    "we have detected two forbidden components in ultraviolet spectra of three do ( i.e. , he - dominated ) white dwarfs and seven pg1159 ( he - c - o dominated ) stars ( fig.[fig : all ] ) .",
    "the dos effective temperature and surface gravity ranges are @xmath7= @xmath8k and @xmath9 , and their carbon abundances range between c = 0.0015 and 0.021 ( mass fraction ) .",
    "the pg1159 stars are hotter ( @xmath7= @xmath10k ) and have surface gravities between @xmath11= 6.5 and 8 .",
    "their carbon abundances are significantly higher ( c = @xmath12 ) .",
    "all stars have in common that the profiles of the allowed transitions are very broad because of linear stark effect in comparison to most other metal lines ( e.g. , from and visible in some spectra displayed in fig.[fig : all ] ) .",
    "the detected forbidden components are 3p4f ( @xmath5 ; fig.[fig : grotrian ] ) in the blue wing of the allowed 3p4d line at 1108 , and 3d4d ( @xmath13 ) in the red wing of the allowed 3d4f line at 1169 .",
    "their profiles are asymmetric , with the broader wing pointing away from the adjacent allowed line . in some spectra ,",
    "the 3p4f transition can be resolved as two fine - structure components .",
    "the spacing between the allowed and forbidden components is about 0.5 .",
    "all lines are multiplets with noticeable splittings because the energy levels are doublets . in table",
    "[ tab : lines ] , we present the wavelengths of the forbidden components as calculated from the level energies listed in the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) database together with new pseudo - relativistic hartree - fock oscillator strengths computed using the cowan s atomic structure codes @xcite",
    ".    we are confident that the identification of the two absorption features as forbidden components is correct and that they do not stem from other elements .",
    "first , none of the ions hitherto identified in the investigated stars is visible over the entire , large @xmath7  range covered by the stars .",
    "second , the observed asymmetric line profiles are neither expected nor observed from allowed transitions .",
    "we noticed the forbidden lines during previous analyses of some of the stars presented here , however , as yet they remained unidentified .",
    "they are most prominent in the do white dwarfs ( top three spectra in fig.[fig : all ] ) and generally weaker in the hottest pg1159 stars .",
    "as can be judged from the model for rxj2117.1 + 3412 , the 3d4d line in this star is blended by a line , however , the other forbidden component 3p4f is clearly visible .",
    "the displayed spectra are overplotted with models whose relevant parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath11 , carbon abundance ) are given in the right panel of fig.[fig : all ] .",
    "most of them were derived in our earlier work , whilst a few are from work in progress , involving new observations ( see below ) .",
    "for conciseness we abstain from individual references . as representative examples we mention our detailed work on the do white dwarf   and on two pg1159 stars . as to the observations ,",
    "the majority of the spectra from the objects in the present study were recorded with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) .",
    "all were described in the publications mentioned .",
    "spectra of pg0111 + 002 , pg0109 + 111 , and pg1707 + 427 , however , are from our observations recently performed with _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( proposal i d 13769 ) .",

    "appropriate quantum - mechanical calculations for the stark line broadening of forbidden components are not available .",
    "@xcite performed such calculations for the interpretation of laboratory spectra with a computer code presented by @xcite but , to our best knowledge , they were not published . for the 3p4f transition ,",
    "broadening data were published by , however , they are useless in our context because it was assumed an isolated line . at the moment , we are only able to include the lines by assuming linear stark effect ( as for the allowed components ) in the approximation presented by and guessing their strength by arbitrarily upscaling theoretical @xmath14-values computed by us . as an example we show in fig.[fig : all_det ] ( black line ) the result of this procedure in the case of the do white dwarf .",
    "the @xmath14-values required scaling by factors of 400 and 10000 for the 3p4f and 3d4d transitions , such that they amount to about @xmath15 .",
    "the line positions are matched while the asymmetries are not because , obviously , our assumption for broadening is poor .",
    "the extended wings that point away from the allowed line component are not broad enough in the model .",
    "an arbitrary increase of the stark damping constant by a factor of six and a further increase of the @xmath14-values by a factor of two results in a better fit , but then the steep wings pointing towards the allowed line components are too broad ( fig.[fig : all_det ] , dashed blue line ) .",
    "the asymmetric line shape of the forbidden components ( with their steep wing always towards the adjacent allowed line ) is identical to the behaviour of such lines of neutral helium in stellar atmospheres . under certain circumstances",
    ", the asymmetry can be very pronounced as was demonstrated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig.2 ) and was explained by the effect of varying ratios of line widths to the separation of forbidden and allowed components as a function of formation depths of line cores and wings .    the detection of the 3d4d forbidden component at 1171  in the experiment by @xcite ( observed in second order )",
    "was subsequently questioned by @xcite who argued that the respective spectral feature is an impurity line , namely the @xmath3585   2p3s2p@xmath16 line ( at 1171  in fourth order ) . in light of our observations in white dwarfs",
    "we conclude that @xcite indeed saw the 3d4d component , at least contributing to the impurity line .",
    "the forbidden components of originally identified in laboratory plasmas @xcite and now in stellar spectra are @xmath17 transitions , where @xmath18 is the principal quantum number .",
    "the 3d4d forbidden component of lithium - like was also detected by @xcite .",
    "it is located at 749  and therefore not accessible in stellar spectra because of extinction by interstellar neutral hydrogen .",
    "the respective @xmath17 lines of lithium - like have even shorter wavelengths .",
