    "at the molecular and cellular levels , cancer is an evolutionary process @xcite driven by random mutational events @xcite responsible for genetic diversification which typically arises via waves of clonal and sub - clonal expansions @xcite , operating over an adaptive fitness landscape in which darwinian selection favors highly proliferative cell phenotypes which in turn drive rapid tumor growth @xcite .",
    "the tumor environment should be viewed as a complex darwinian adaptive eco - system consisting of cell types which have evolved over many years @xcite . as a result , all but the most well designed and tailored therapeutic strategies often deliver disappointing outcomes and potentially introduce a potent new source of selective pressure for the proliferation of variant cells which develop an enhanced ability to resist future therapeutic assaults @xcite .",
    "the prospects for influencing and controlling such a system are likeliest at the emerging early stages of tumor development when the cell population has not yet been selected for growth and survival , and the tumor size is small .",
    "but by the time a typical tumor becomes clinically detectable ( often after several years of growth ) , it already contains @xmath0 or more malignant cells ( and potentially occupies a volume of @xmath1 ) , some of which may have entered the blood circulation @xcite .",
    "since there is very little human data available in this early subclinical stage of tumor development , computational models can serve as a useful surrogate in this critical developmental stage which clearly influences and determines many important emergent features of the tumor at later stages .",
    "our goals in this paper are to describe a mathematical model for stochastic cell kinetics in the beginning stages of tumor development ( from a single malignant cell ) that includes cell reproduction and death , mutations , evolution , and the subsequent emergence of genetic heterogeneity well documented in many soft - tissue tumors @xcite .",
    "the model is a computational one , driven by a stochastic moran ( birth - death ) process with a finite cell population , in which birth - death rates are functions of cell fitness .",
    "the fitness is determined by the cell s numerical genome in the form of a four - digit binary string capable of undergoing point mutational dynamics with one digit in the string flipping values stochastically .",
    "the corresponding numerical value of the binary string determines whether the cell is healthy ( low - fitness ) or cancerous ( high fitness ) .",
    "these two classes of cells compete against each other at each birth - death event , with fitness calculated according to the payoff matrix associated with the prisoner s dilemma evolutionary zero - sum game @xcite .",
    "the healthy cells play the role of cooperators , while the cancer cells play the role of defectors @xcite .",
    "our goal is to understand how the model parameters : passenger ( @xmath2 ) and driver mutation rates ( @xmath3 ) , selection strength ( @xmath4 ) , birth and death rates , affect tumor growth characteristics , such as tumor growth rates , fixation probabilities of malignant and healthy cell types , saturation rates of cancer cells , and the emergence of genetic heterogeneity in a tumor at later stages of development when the tumor is clinically detectable .",
    "an important outcome of the model is that growth of the cancer cell population is directly influenced by the intratumor heterogeneity ( represented as the distribution of the 4-digit binary strings throughout the cell population ) , with high heterogeneity driving more rapid growth .",
    "the connection between heterogeneity and growth has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we quantify heterogeneity in a tumor using tools from information theory @xcite , as well as quantitative analysis of phylogenetic trees associated with clonal and sub - clonal expansions @xcite in the developing tumor .",
    "because our numerical simulations are carried out from initial conditions corresponding to a homogeneous population of healthy cells ( 0000 ) all the way to a saturated population of cancer cells , we can use the model to test basic dose and scheduling strategies @xcite at the very early stages of tumor development in the subclinical range , well before a tumor would be clinically detectable by current technology .",
    "our point of view is that this emerging subclinical tumor should be more amenable ( and potentially vulnerable ) to a well planned therapeutic assault than a more mature tumor comprised ( on average ) of larger numbers of cells with more aggressive proliferative capabilities ( having undergone generations of selection ) , that are potentially in the early stages of migration to other organs .",
    "more complex features that might influence early stage dynamics , like human - immune response @xcite and the tumor microenvironment @xcite are not included in this model in order to keep things as simple and clear as possible .",
    "the ingredients in our model includes a stochastic birth - death process that is the engine which drives tumor growth , with heritable mutations operating over a fitness landscape so that natural selection can play out over many cell division timescales .",
    "genetic mutations ( point mutations ) are modeled using a four - digit binary string of information that each cell carries with it .",
    "this simple sequence divides the cells into 16 different  genotypes \" , ranging from 0000 up to 1111 , and this information is passed on to the daughter cell during a birth event .",
    "the birth - death replacement process is based on a fitness function defined in terms of interactions quantified by the prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix which operates on two general classes of cells : healthy ( the cooperators ) , and cancerous ( the defectors ) .",
    "natural selection acts on each generation of the cell population as the computational simulation proceeds on a cell division timescale . in this version of the model",
    "we typically simulate up to @xmath5 cell divisions , so our mutation rates are chosen to be relatively high to accommodate these somewhat modest timescales .",
    "see @xcite for discussions on mutation rates in cancer .",
    "the stochastic engine @xcite that drives tumor growth in our model is a finite cell - based moran process consisting of a population of n cells , divided into two sub - populations consisting of @xmath6 cancer cells , and @xmath7 healthy cells . in all of our simulations",
    ", @xmath8 is large enough so that there is not a significant difference between the results from our finite - cell model and the ( deterministic ) replicator equation approach for infinite populations , a connection that is discussed in detail in @xcite . at each time",
    "- step in the simulation , one cell is chosen for reproduction and one cell is chosen for elimination .",
    "the cells are chosen randomly , based on their prevalence in the population pool which , in turn , is weighted by the fitness function based on a chosen payoff matrix .",
    "the probability of choosing a cancer cell at any given step is @xmath9 , while the probability of choosing a healthy cell is @xmath10 .",
    "as it unfolds , the process is a stochastic birth - death process where the total population size , @xmath8 , stays constant and the number of cancer cells in the population , @xmath6 , is the stochastic state variable . at any given step , the probability of transitioning from i cancer cells to j cancer cells is denoted @xmath11 , with @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "these probabilities are determined by the birth / death rates associated with the cancer cell population , which in turn are determined by a cell population fitness function .",
    "each cell carries with it a binary string in the form of a four digit binary sequence from 0000 up to 1111 .",
    "this defines 16 different cell types , which are course - grained into two groups : healthy cells ( 0000 - 1010 ) , and cancer cells ( 1011 - 1111 ) .",
    "these two sub - populations interact at each birth - death time - step with fitness defined in terms of the prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix .",
    "the algorithmic details are shown in the appendix figure [ app1 ] . to set the stage for more complex simulations , figure [ fig1 ]",
    "shows the result of a stochastic simulation ( depicting @xmath6 ) driven by the moran process alone , with no mutations , and no selection .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows three different simulations , one leading to the elimination of all cancer cells via random drift ( red ) , another fluctuates between a mixed cell population after 10,000 cell divisions ( yellow ) , and a third leading to fixation of the cancer cell population ( blue ) after around 5000 cell divisions . the average of 25 stochastic simulations is also plotted ( note that the average will converge to half cancer cells and half healthy cells by the law of large numbers ) . the mean time to fixation of the cancer cell population which starts with ` i ' cells in this simple",

    "the blue curve leads to fixation of the cancer cell population , the red curve leads to elimination of the cancer cell population , and the yellow curve remains fluctuating in a mixed population of cells after 10,000 cell divisions .",
    "an average of 25 stochastic simulations ( black dashed line ) is also plotted.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      to introduce the effect of selection which will regulate cell birth and death rates , we use the prisoner s dilemma evolutionary game in which two players compete against each other for the best payoff .",
    "each has to decide whether to cooperate ( healthy cell ) or defect ( cancer cell ) and each receives a payoff determined from the prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix .",
    "the chosen values in ( [ pd ] ) are relatively standard , but not unique .",
    "more discussion of why the prisoner s dilemma matrix , which models the evolution of defection , is a useful paradigm for cancer can be found in @xcite and some of the references therin . ] , a :    @xmath16    the essence of the prisoner s dilemma game is the two players compete against each other , and each has to decide what best strategy to adopt in order to maximize their payoff .",
    "this 2 x 2 matrix assigns the payoff ( e.g. reward ) to each player on each interaction .",
    "my options , as a strategy or , equivalently , as a cell type , are listed along the rows , with row 1 associated with my possible choice to cooperate , or equivalently my cell type being healthy , and row 2 associated with my possible choice to defect , or equivalently my cell type being cancerous .",
    "your options are listed down the columns , with column 1 associated with your choice to cooperate ( or you being a healthy cell ) , and column 2 associated with your choice to defect ( or you being a cancer cell ) .",
    "the analysis of a rational player in a prisoner s dilemma game runs as follows .",
    "i do not know what strategy you will choose , but suppose you choose to cooperate ( column 1 ) .",
    "in that case , i am better off defecting ( row 2 ) since i receive a payoff of 5 instead of 3 ( if i also cooperate ) .",
    "suppose instead you choose to defect ( column 2 ) .",
    "in that case , i am also better off defecting ( row 2 ) since i receive a payoff of 1 instead of 0 ( if i were to have cooperated ) .",
    "therefore , _ no matter what you choose , i am better off ( from a pure payoff point of view ) if i defect_. what makes this game such a useful paradigm for strategic interactions ranging from economics , political science , biology @xcite , and even psychology @xcite is the following additional observation . _ you will analyze the game in exactly the same way i did ( just switch the roles of me and you in the previous rational analysis ) , so you will also decide to defect no matter what i do_. the upshot if we both defect is that we will each receive a payoff of 1 , instead of each receiving a payoff of 3 if we had both chosen to cooperate .",
    "the defect - defect combination is a nash equilibrium @xcite , and yet it is sub - optimal for both players and for the system as a whole .",
    "rational thought rules out the cooperate - cooperate combination which would be better for each player ( 3 points each ) and for both players combined ( 6 points ) .",
    "in fact , the nash equilibrium strategy of defect - defect is the worst possible system wide choice , yielding a total payoff of 2 points , compared to the cooperate - defect or defect - cooperate combination , which yields a total payoff of 5 points , or the best system - wide strategy of cooperate - cooperate yielding a total payoff of 6 points .",
    "the game becomes even more interesting if it is played repeatedly @xcite , with each player allowed to decide what strategy to use on each interaction so as to accumulate a higher payoff than the competition over a sequence of n games . in order to analyze this kind of an evolving set - up , a fitness function",
    "must be introduced based on the payoff matrix a. let us now switch our terminology so that the relevance to tumor cell kinetics becomes clear . in this case , we randomly select pairs of cells out of the total population at each step , and subject them to a birth - death process , basing our birth rates and death rates on the prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix . thus , in our context , it is not the strategies that evolve , as cells can not change type based on strategy ( only based on mutations ) , but the prevalence of each cell type in the population is evolving , with the winner identified as the sub - type that first reaches fixation in the population .",
    "as the populations evolve , the fitness of the two competing sub - populations can be tracked , as well as the overall fitness of the combined total population of cells .",
    "let us start by laying out the various probabilities of pairs of cells interacting and clearly defining payoffs when there are @xmath6 cancer cells , and @xmath7 healthy cells in the population .",
    "the probability that a healthy cell interacts with another healthy cell is given by @xmath17 , whereas the probability that a healthy cell interacts with a cancer cell is @xmath18 .",
    "the probability that a cancer cell interacts with a healthy cell is @xmath19 , whereas the probability that a cancer cell interacts with another cancer cell is @xmath20 .",
    "the payoffs associated with the healthy cells and cancer cells , obtained by weighting the payoff matrix values with appropriate probabilities , are given by ( following notation in @xcite ) :    @xmath21    @xmath22    this gives rise to the average payoff associated with the population of cells :    @xmath23    based on these formulas , we define the fitness of the healthy cells as :    @xmath24    and the fitness of the cancer cells as :    @xmath25    here , @xmath26 are ` selection strength ' parameters , @xmath27 , that measure the strength of selection pressure on each of the population of cells .",
    "if @xmath28 , there is no natural selection acting on the healthy cell population and the dynamics is driven purely by the moran process . when @xmath29 , the selection pressure on the healthy cell population is strongest and the prisoner s dilemma payoff matrix has maximum effect .",
    "likewise for the parameter @xmath30 and how it controls selection pressure in the cancer cell population .",
    "since therapy imposes selection pressure on different sub - populations of cells , @xmath31 and @xmath30 are the two parameters we alter to administer simulated therapeutic responses .",
    "we discuss this in section  3.5 .",
    "the expected fitness of each of the sub - populations are :    @xmath32    @xmath33    with total expected fitness :    @xmath34    from these formulas , we can define the transition probability of going from @xmath6 to @xmath35 cancer cells on a given step :    @xmath36    the first term represents that probability that a cancer cell is selected for reproduction ( weighted by fitness ) , and a healthy cell is selected for death .",
    "likewise , the transition probability of going from @xmath6 to @xmath37 cancer cells on a given step is :    @xmath38    here , the first term is the probability healthy cell is selected for reproduction ( weighted by fitness ) , and a cancer cell is selected for death .",
    "the remaining transition probabilities are as follows :    @xmath39    it is these simple formulas that drive the subsequent dynamics of the competing populations of cells and determine the emergent features of the forming tumor ( cancer cell population ) .",

    "a mutation diagram is shown in figure [ fig8 ] depicting all of the possible point mutation transitions at each step .",
    "mutations that stay within either of those two ranges do not alter the cell fitness . on the other hand , the driver mutation parameter controls mutations that take a binary string from a healthy cell and , via a point mutation , alter it so that the string becomes a cancer cell . a simple example would be a mutation that alters 1010 ( healthy ) to 1011 ( cancer ) by stochastically flipping the first digit from 0 to 1 . the interested reader can consult the flow diagram in figure [ app1 ] of the appendix for more details of the algorithm .",

    "gompertzian growth arising from multicellular systems occurs in many settings with different physical and biological constraints acting in concert .",
    "hence it appears as if this universal growth curve does not depend on specific physical mechanisms ( e.g. oxygen diffusion , blood supply , tumor microenvironment , etc . ) but more on multi - cellularity and the ability for populations of cells to assume a heterogeneous distribution of functional states , as was described most clearly in kendal s 1985 paper @xcite and documented clinically in breast @xcite and other tumor types .",

    "eqns ( [ cancerbirth ] ) , ( [ cancerdeath ] ) are the governing equations controlling birth / death rates of the cancer cell , healthy cell sub - populations as natural selection plays out . since the proliferation of cancer cells can be thought of as an imbalance of selection pressures on the competing sub - populations in favor of the cancer sub - population , the goal of any therapeutic intervention is to alter this complex imbalance in favor of the healthy cell sub - population .",

    "to summarize the main points forming the framework of our model :    * ( i ) * a tumor is a complex darwinian ecosystem of competing cells operating on an adaptive fitness landscape driven by mutational dynamics and shaped by evolutionary pressures ;    * ( ii ) * the basic competitors in an evolutionary game theory model of tumor development are cell populations with a broad distribution of fitness characteristics course grained into two types : healthy cells ( cooperators ) and cancer cells ( defectors ) .",
    "each of these cell sub - populations attempts to maximize its own fitness ;    * ( iii ) * cell fitness is associated with reproductive prowess and in this respect , healthy cells are less fit than cancer cells ;    * ( iv ) * primary tumors initiate from a single malignant cell that has undergone the appropriate mutational steps and subsequently undergoes clonal and sub - clonal expansion .",
    "polyclonality and heterogeneity are thus seen as emergent features of tumor development ;    * ( v ) * parameters and distributions measured in the detectable range of tumor growth , such as tumor growth rates and fixation probabilities , are emergent features that have developed from a monoclonal state via cell kinetics and evolutionary development taking place in the subclinical regime ;    * ( vi ) * tumor growth is driven by molecular heterogeneity of the cell population comprising the tumor and reflected in the growth equation ( [ eqn23 ] ) ;    * ( vii ) * tumor cell populations are more amenable to therapeutic strategies in the early stages of development , before selection for growth and survival have shaped the environment .",
    "we believe the simple evolutionary model described in this paper , driven by a moran process and shaped by heritable mutations with a fitness landscape based on the prisoner s dilemma evolutionary game is useful in helping to understand early stage tumor growth and how it is influenced by the interplay of a few select small number of key parameters . when a malignant tumor cell population has already exceeded @xmath119 cells , some of which may have entered the circulation or lymphatics and migrated to other sites , the opportunity to control or even shape future events may be limited . attacking tumor heterogeneity",
