    "present predictions of @xmath7 at energies covered by the linear collider differ by large factors@xcite , as we show in fig.[fig1 ] . at @xmath8 different models",
    "can predict values which differ by a factor 3 , and the differences widen as the energy increase .",
    "we plan , in the following , to discuss a work program to reach stable predictions , based on a qcd description of the decrease and the rise of total cross - sections through soft gluon summation ( bloch - nordsieck model ) and mini - jets .     from various models , aspen @xcite , sas@xcite , bsw@xcite , glmn @xcite , bkks @xcite , emm @xcite and cudell et al .",
    "]    there are different reasons why predictions differ so widely one from the other , some of which are related to the fact that there is no calculation to obtain quantitative descriptions of total cross - sections from first principles .",
    "this would not necessarily be a deterrent from making correct predictions , as the @xmath9 case shows . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show present data and some model predictions for the proton case .",
    "another important reason for the variety of predictions is that all models for @xmath0 apply some degree of extrapolation from @xmath1 and @xmath9 data . since , for both photon and proton processes , there are still differences among data at high energy ( although within one or two standard deviations at most ) this ends up doubling the errors in the extrapolation to @xmath0 .",
    "the present range of variability of the high energy data for the photoproduction cross - section is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where present data are shown together with the predictions from the eikonal minijet model ( emm)@xcite .     and predictions from the aspen@xcite and emm@xcite model .",
    "hera data are from zeus @xcite , h1 @xcite and a set of data extrapolated from @xmath10 from the zeus bpc @xcite . ]    as for @xmath0 , it should also be pointed out that at low energies old @xmath0 data have large errors and even lep data @xcite may have a 10% normalization error .",
    "finally , @xmath0 data do not reach a high enough energy to pinpoint how the cross - section rises ( unlike the @xmath9 case ) .",
    "these reasons make widely varying predictions for @xmath7 .",
    "we can distinguish between various models by grouping them as those for which the photon is treated like a proton vs. the qcd models . to the first group there belong also models based on gribov factorization @xmath11 for which @xmath12.the qcd based models include the eikonal minijet model ( emm ) for which @xmath13 .",
    "we show in fig . 4 two different predictions from the emm , which will be discussed shortly .     and fits using the emm , with and without soft gluon resumation .",
    "a work program to reach stable predictions will be based on treating the photon at low energy like a proton , while distinguishing it from the proton at high energy where qcd processes and parton densities may be different for protons and photons . at the same time",
    "it will be important to attempt a unified description for all three processes .",
    "the basic expression for the total hadronic cross - section , to be used throughout this paper , will be based on the eikonal approximation , namely @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a phenomenological parameter introduced to describe the probability that a photon behaves like a hadron .",
    "its value can be fixed from quark counting rules and vector meson dominance , to be @xmath16 , @xmath17 . for @xmath0 processes",
    "[ total ] holds with @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "[ total ] is also used for purely hadronic processes , in which case @xmath19 .",
    "we set @xmath20 and from the expression for the inelastic cross - section , i.e. @xmath21\\ ] ] we identify @xmath22 with the average number @xmath23 of inelastic collisions taking place for any given value of the impact parameter @xmath24 , at energy @xmath25 of the colliding hadrons . in the figures to follow , for all the curves with bloch - nordsieck resummation , for @xmath26 we have chosen the soft part of @xmath23 as coming only from proton proton , as this seems to give the best description for the soft part , whereas for @xmath0 we have chosen the average between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then , for @xmath29 @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "resummation of soft gluons takes place through the fourier transform of the exponentiated soft gluon transverse momentum distribution in @xmath24 space , obtained using the bloch - nordsieck ( bn ) method@xcite , @xmath32 , with @xmath33\\ ] ]    in the bn model , the impact parameter space distribution appearing in the eikonal formalism is then identified with    @xmath34    in our work program , we first obtain a good description of proton data@xcite .",
    "this allows to fix the soft eikonal to be used together with qcd minijets and resummation for protons .",
    "we then try to get a good description of @xmath26 using the soft eikonal , and , subsequently , fix the jet parameters , @xmath35 and densities , to be used with photons .",
    "resummation and its embodyment in the emm constitute a very challenging task : this involves calculating the function @xmath36 , i.e. fix @xmath37 and @xmath38 for each parton parton scattering . in our presently simplified approach",
    ", we shall average the function @xmath39 , and hence @xmath38 , over densities and parton cross - sections , obtaining for @xmath38 a rising function of the energy @xmath25 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "a second crucial point of the bn approach , comes in setting @xmath40 .",
    "this requires the knowledge of @xmath41 as @xmath42@xcite .",
    "we use here the model in @xcite , with an @xmath43 singular but integrable as discussed in @xcite , and such that for @xmath44 , while for @xmath45 . notice that if p is smaller than 1 the integral in the function @xmath36 can be done .",
    "to leading order in @xmath46 the energy dependence which ultimately will soften the rise due to mini - jets , comes from the maximum transverse momentum allowed to a single gluon emitted by the most energetic partons at the beginning of the qcd cascade , valence quarks for the proton , all type of quarks for the photon .",
    "the kinematics for the emission @xcite gives @xmath47 with integration to be done over @xmath48 , the energy of the initial parton - parton subprocess and the jet - jet invariant mass @xmath49 .",
    "averaging over densities @xmath50 with the lower limit of integration in the variable @xmath51 given by @xmath52 .",
    "the bloch nordsieck model is like the emm model with @xmath53 driving the rise .",
    "the fourier transform of soft gluon emission in @xmath54 space gives the impact parameter space distribution of colliding partons .",
    "this introduces an energy dependence in the b - distribution of partons in the hadrons which depends on @xmath35 and the parton densities .",
    "one achieves two main results , a softening effect , and a reduction of the dependence from hard scattering parameters .",
    "the softening effect happens because as @xmath25 increases , the phase space available for soft gluon emission also increases , and with it the transverse momentum of the initial colliding pair due to soft gluon emission .",
    "this leads to more straggling of initial partons and hence to a reduced probability for the collision .",
    "in the proton - proton and proton - antiproton fit with the bloch - nordsieck ( bn ) model , for the average number of collisions , we now write @xmath57 where @xmath58 is obtained using the bn anstz , with a @xmath38 which becomes constant after a slight initial rise .",
    "soft gluon emission has now a twofold effect as the energy increases : with @xmath59 constant or decreasing ( as from regge exchange ) @xmath60 will decrease , whereas , with @xmath61 increasing rapidly , @xmath62 will still increase but not as much as without soft gluons . a good description is obtained with a soft part given by @xmath63 and @xmath64        we show our present description @xcite of @xmath65 and @xmath66 data in fig . [ fig5 ] .",
    "with the previously described expressions , we now turn to @xmath26 , using @xmath67 .",
    "we obtain various fits , depending upon the densities being used for the photon , and the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6],[fig7],[fig8 ] , for each set of densities and various values of @xmath35 .",
    "cross - section , with soft gluon resummation ( bn ) and grv densities in the mini - jet cross - section . ]     cross - section , with soft gluon resummation ( bn ) and grs densities in the mini - jet cross - section , for an indicative set of values for @xmath35 . ]    , [ fig7 ] with cjkl densities and a set of @xmath35 values which fit the high energy data . ]    the present update for @xmath0 is done using the soft part of the eikonal @xmath23 from the average of the proton and the antiproton fit , i.e. @xmath68 , soft resummation for hard scattering , and three types of densities , grv@xcite , grs@xcite and cjkl @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show a comparison between the predictions from the aspen model , the emm without soft gluon emission , and two curves from the emm with inclusion of soft gluons and different parton densities .",
    "we also indicate ( stars ) pseudo data points to be measured at the future linear collider . how predictions for @xmath7 depend upon @xmath35 in the case of cjkl densities , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "similar results hold for other densities .",
    "in this talk we have presented a comprehensive description of proton and photon total cross - sections , based on the use of the eikonal representation and on the hypothesis that qcd jet cross - sections drive the rise of all total cross - sections .",
    "this eikonal minijet model ( emm ) is not fully satisfactory , since the rise with energy thus predicted is either too fast or too slow , depending on the parameters .",
    "it is shown that inclusion of soft gluon emission from initial state partons can give a much more realistic description in all cases , @xmath69 and @xmath0 .",
    "different models are also discussed and compared with the data and with the emm .",
