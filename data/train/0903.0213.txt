    "most of the quantized resistances in these figures match with the inverse of two - terminal conductance observed previously .",
    "@xcite thus , @xmath4 in this region corresponds to the two - terminal ( or hall ) resistance of transmitted edge states . in contrast to the two - terminal results , however , figs .",
    "3(e ) and ( f ) show clear 1/2 plateaus .",
    "this indicates that the disorder effect , which has been regarded as the cause of the observed reduction in the conductance for @xmath16=@xmath17=@xmath212 in the previous study ,  @xcite is negligible in this four - terminal measurement .",

    "this sign change seems to be odd because these plateaus correspond to the _ counterclockwise _ edge states in the region 1 , where @xmath4 is supposed to be negative .",
    "a careful analysis , however , indicates that the @xmath4 for @xmath16@xmath22@xmath23@xmath150 [ the n@xmath24-p@xmath25-n@xmath24 region in fig .",
    "3(a ) and the p@xmath24-n@xmath25-p@xmath24 region in fig .",

    "horizontal lines represent the filling factor @xmath16 where one - dimensional data in figs . 2 and 3 are extracted . ]    the landauer - bttiker formula  @xcite is suitable for studying the one - dimensional edge - state transport where the current through the lead @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is expressed as a linear combination of transmission coefficients ( @xmath30 ) multiplied by the corresponding chemical potentials ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "accordingly , it is required to evaluate the scattering matrix ( @xmath32 ) with the elements @xmath30 s and then solve the linear equations ( @xmath33=@xmath32@xmath34 ) , which is straightforward in our case because the reflection ( @xmath27 ) happens at _",
    "p - n _ interfaces only [ see fig .",
    "this procedure is adopted to obtain @xmath1 and @xmath4 in ref . [ 4 ] for the configuration that is identical to ours .",

    "4(a ) rather than a five - terminal one corresponding to the actual device . since each resistance ( @xmath1 or @xmath4 )",
    "was obtained in a four - terminal configuration , the schematic is equivalent to the real device configuration , namely , @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) in fig .",
    "1(a ) corresponds to @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in fig .",
    "since @xmath42 and @xmath44 depend on the chiral direction of incoming edge states @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for the _ clockwise _ ( _ counterclockwise _ ) edge states in the region 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 changes as the sign of @xmath16 changes at a fixed magnetic - field direction , but it represents the same resistance if both @xmath16 and the magnetic - field direction are altered .",
    "this explains the inversion symmetry shown in fig .",
    "two - terminal resistance in a bipolar configuration studied previously  @xcite corresponds to @xmath45 only in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which is the hall resistance from the @xmath47 transmitted edge states .",
    "it is consistent with our observation shown in figs .",
    "3(e ) and 3(f ) , which correspond to the _ clockwise _ edge states in the region 1 .",
    "but , the information on the reflected edge states is lost in the two - terminal process . on the other hand , @xmath46 represents the eliminated hall resistance by the @xmath27 reflected edge - states , which can be observed only in a four - terminal configuration .",
    "this implies that the average of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , ( @xmath45@xmath48@xmath46)/2 , provides the hall resistance of @xmath26 incoming edge states ( the sign for @xmath46 is reversed because @xmath45 and @xmath46 are measured in the opposite direction with respect to the current flow ) .",
    "thus , if more than a half of the incoming edge states are reflected ( 2@xmath27@xmath20@xmath26 ) , @xmath46 can change the sign , accounting for the odd sign of resistances seen in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1 indicates the difference between the ( two - terminal ) hall resistance of the @xmath47 transmitted and the @xmath26 incoming edge states which is always positive or equal to zero for @xmath27=0 . in consequence , all the unexpected features in @xmath4 as well as the finite value of @xmath1",
    "are well accounted for at least qualitatively .    for a quantitative analysis",
    ", we estimated the number of the reflected edge states ( @xmath27 ) in three different regimes :  @xcite the edge - state - transmission regime ( @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath200 , @xmath26=@xmath49@xmath50@xmath51 ) , partial - equilibration regime ( @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath200 , @xmath26=@xmath49@xmath15@xmath51 ) , and full - equilibration regime ( @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath150 , @xmath26=@xmath49 ) . based on the complete - mode - mixing hypothesis ,  @xcite it is evident that @xmath27 is equal to @xmath49-@xmath51 in the edge - state - transmission regime , where the extra edge states in the region 1 ( @xmath49-@xmath51 ) are forbidden in the region 2 . in the partial - equilibration regime ,",
    "the excess states ( @xmath51-@xmath49 ) circulate in the region 2 while in partial equilibration with the incoming edge states ( @xmath49 ) . finally ,",
    "in the full - equilibration regime , the edge states in the regions 1 ( @xmath49 ) and 2 ( @xmath51 ) circulate in opposite directions , propagating in the same direction along the _ p - n _ interfaces and equilibrate with each other . in the last two regimes",
    ", one can calculate @xmath27 by using the current - conservation relation .",
    "@xcite schematic edge - state circulation and values of the @xmath27 are illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "4(a ) for each regime . with these values of filling factor in eq .",

    "4(b ) and 4(c ) , respectively , with the calculated resistance labeled in each block .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) , unless @xmath16=@xmath17 , @xmath1 becomes positive and is in good quantitative agreement with the observed results as denoted by the broken lines in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are also well reproduced by the calculation as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) as well as fig .",
    "although not shown , the observed -10 t data of @xmath4 [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] are also well fit by the calculation .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath16@xmath200 ( @xmath150 ) at 10 t ( -10 t ) , the calculated @xmath4 becomes positive in the region where @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath150 or @xmath49@xmath202@xmath51 and @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath200 , reproducing the odd sign of resistances found in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "again , all the observed features of @xmath4 are well accounted for in terms of the landauer - bttiker formula .",
    "@xcite since all of these results are linked to the chiral - directional dependence of @xmath4 , one can conclude that edge states in graphene also behave in the same way as those in a conventional 2d electron gas ,  @xcite although the qh effect itself is distinct by the dirac nature of charge carriers .",
    "most of the observed results in the color maps shown in figs . 2 and 3 are quantitatively accounted for .",
    "however , one can distinguish some additional features which appear as a faint diagonal bands crossing from the bottom - right region to the top - left region of the figures in the ranges @xmath3@xmath20@xmath1860 v and @xmath3@xmath15@xmath1830 v near the boundary where @xmath17 changes sign .",
    "in fact , these band structures constitute additional resistance plateaus of @xmath180.24 , @xmath180.07 , and @xmath180.4 as indicated by arrows in figs .",
    "2(c ) , 3(c ) , and 3(f ) , respectively . solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath1@xmath180.24 , @xmath46@xmath180.07 , and @xmath45@xmath180.4 at @xmath26=@xmath49=6 gives almost identical @xmath27 values as @xmath183.54 , @xmath183.52 , and @xmath183.5 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that these unexpected resistance plateaus are all produced by a single 5/2 ( = @xmath26@xmath48@xmath27=6@xmath487/2 ) edge - state transmission for @xmath49=6 , @xmath51=2 , and @xmath16@xmath22@xmath17@xmath200 , just before @xmath17 changes sign or , equivalently , just before the edge - state transmission regime turns into the full equilibration regime .",
    "this state may be related to the disorder in the region 2 , but no related features are present at @xmath16=@xmath17=@xmath212 in our measurement .",
    "@xcite in addition , the disorder effect is not supposed to be significant in our four - terminal measurement .",
    "another possible explanation is based on the fact that the plateaus take place near the boundary between the edge - state transmission and the full - equilibration regimes .",
    "one may imagine the presence of counter - propagating edge states : for instance , @xmath55+@xmath56 _ clockwise _ edge states and @xmath56 _ counterclockwise _ edge states in the region 2 . here , we expect that @xmath56 should be an integer less than 2 , because no fractional qh effect is present  @xcite and the maximum filling factor in the region 2 is two . however , a simple calculation of the total reflection @xmath27 by adding two different @xmath27 values for the _ clockwise _ edge states ( edge - state transmission ) and the _ counterclockwise _ ones ( full equilibration ) leads to @xmath56 much larger than 2 ( about 4.7 , corresponding to @xmath27=7/2 ) , which is far from the expectation .",
    "the discrepancy can arise from the incomplete mode mixing for the counter - propagating edge states , which leads to the 5/2 transmission when only two and a half out of three _ clockwise _ edge states participate in the equilibration process completely .",
    "these counter - propagating edge states may originate from the compressible and incompressible edge states  @xcite formed near the boundary of the graphene by the charge accumulation as suggested for the graphene sheet placed above a global backgate .",
    "@xcite however , the strange diagonal bands observed in our study indicate that the local gate , _ by some means , further enhances the charge accumulation .",
    "_ the presence of the qh ferromagnet states  @xcite can also be considered for the counter - propagating edge states .",
    "but , the zeeman energy in 10 t is only about 20 k ,  @xcite which is much smaller than the energy difference between the lowest and the first exited landau levels , @xmath18700 k.  @xcite although this phenomenon can be understood by assuming both the incomplete mode mixing and the presence of counter - propagating edge states ,  @xcite further theoretical and experimental investigation is required for a conclusive account for the effect .",
    "we studied the edge - state equilibration processes in a locally gated _ p - n - p _ junction of the graphene by measuring the four - terminal qh resistances .",
    "our scheme enables measurements of finite longitudinal and asymmetric diagonal qh resistances , which furnish precise information on the reflected as well as the transmitted qh edge states .",
    "most of our observations are quantitatively analyzed by the landauer - bttiker formula  @xcite based on the complete - mode mixing hypothesis .",
    "but , unexpected resistance plateaus corresponding to the 5/2 transmission of edge states are also observed .",
    "we suggest that it may arise from the incomplete mode mixing and/or the presence of the counter - propagating qh edge states .",
    "@xcite    our simple four - terminal measurement scheme reported here is not sensitive to the contact resistance and the sample geometry , so that it can be conveniently used for the edge - state manipulation of arbitrary - shaped devices such as mach - zehnder interferometers .",
