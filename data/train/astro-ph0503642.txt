    "two neutron - capture processes are important for astrophysical nucleosynthesis of heavy elements .",
    "the first one is a rapid neutron - capture process ( r - process ) that is considered to occur in supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite , and the other is a slow neutron - capture process ( s - process ) in low - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite or massive stars @xcite .",
    "long - lived radioactive nuclei are used as nucleo - cosmochronometers , which are useful for an investigation of nucleosynthesis process history along the galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) before the solar system formation .",
    "a general idea of the nucleo - cosmochronometer was proposed by rutherford about 70 years ago  @xcite .",
    "radioactive nuclei of cosmological significance are rare and only six chronometers with half - lives in the range of the cosmic age 1 @xmath11 100 gyr are known .",
    "they are @xmath12k  @xcite and @xmath13rb  @xcite for the s - process or explosive nucleosynthesis in sne , @xmath14lu  @xcite for the photodisintegration reaction nucleosynthesis in sne ( @xmath3-process ) , and @xmath1re  @xcite , @xmath15th and @xmath16u  @xcite for the r - process . recently",
    "two actinoid elements u and th in a very metal - poor star were detected for the first time  @xcite .",
    "the actinoid nuclei in the old metal - poor star were perhaps created in a single r - process of a sn explosion .",
    "since the initial abundances of @xmath16u and @xmath15th can not be measured directly these abundances should be calculated in the framework of the r - process models .",
    "however the calculated results by many models  @xcite are different from one another and thus a large uncertainty still remains in the estimation with the u - th chronometer .",
    "a pair of nuclei , @xmath1re-@xmath1os , was proposed to be an intentional cosmochronometer to date the r - process  @xcite .",
    "1 shows a nuclear chart and flows of nucleosynthesis processes around the nucleus @xmath1re .",
    "the nucleus @xmath1re is predominantly produced by @xmath17-decay after the freezeout of the r - process and is located outside the main path of the s - process .",
    "the s - process nuclei @xmath18os are not directly produced by the r - process because they are shielded by the stable isobars of @xmath0w and @xmath1re against the @xmath19-decay after the r - process .",
    "the pure s - process nucleus @xmath0os is used for the normalization of the s - process abundances in this mass region . the s - process nucleus @xmath1os is also produced by the cosmoradiogenic @xmath20-decay of @xmath1re .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1re decays to @xmath1os with a half - life of 4.35@xmath2110@xmath22 yr  @xcite , which is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath1re-@xmath1os chronometer has the advantage that applying this chronometer is free from the uncertainty of the initial abundances calculated by the r - process models .",
    "the epoch from an r - process nucleosynthesis event to the present can be evaluated by the present abundances of @xmath1re and @xmath1os after the subtraction of the s - process contributions to these nuclei .",
    "although the initial abundances of @xmath1re and @xmath1os should be calculated using the s - process models , the uncertainty of the calculated s - process abundances is generally smaller than those in the r - process models .",
    "the @xmath1re-@xmath1os chronometer has been applied for studying the gce  @xcite .",
    "this chronometer was also used in analyses of meteorites  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath1re and @xmath1os abundances in iron meteorites and ordinary chondrites were used for evaluating the ages of the meteorites , which were formed from a metal reservoir at the solar system formation . these results lead to an upper - limit estimation of the age of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the half - life of the @xmath20-decay of @xmath1re is affected by stellar environments  @xcite .",
    "the half - life depends on the temperature and the electron density of the stellar environments .",
    "the half - life becomes shorter in high temperature such as @xmath23 @xmath24 10@xmath25 k due to the enhanced bound - state @xmath19-decay in ionized atoms .",
    "this phenomena was verified in a measurement of the change of the half - life of the ionized @xmath0re  @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath1re-@xmath1os system is still an important chronometer in the astronomical observations of old stars and in the analyses of pre - solar grains in primitive meteorites for the chronology of the r - process .",
    "the chemical compositions of the extremely metal - poor stars are enhanced by the production of heavy elements in neutron - capture nucleosynthesis in the first generation stars .",
    "recently astronomical observations with isotope separations have been carried out for several heavy elements such as ba  @xcite and eu  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the pre - solar grains in the primitive meteorites provide samples affected strongly by a single nucleosynthesis event .",
    "heavy elements such as mo , te and ba in the pre - solar grains have already been separated into isotopes .",
    "the origins of these pre - solar grains are considered to be the ejecta of core collapse sn explosions  @xcite .",

    "this isomer was found by lindner about 50 years ago  @xcite , and then seegmiller _ et al . _",

    "therefore the neutron capture cross section to the isomer has not been established  @xcite . the half - life of the ground state of @xmath0re is only 3.718 days , while that of the isomer , 2.0@xmath2110@xmath29 yr , is longer than the timescale of the s - process , 10@xmath31 @xmath11 10@xmath32 yr . the s - process contribution should be , thus , estimated with high accuracy .    in the present work we measure the neutron - capture cross section ratio @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath30 / @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath5 at the thermal energy .",
    "an implication of this path in the abundances of @xmath1re and @xmath1os is discussed using our data in a classical steady - flow model , and an effect to the chronometry is evaluated in a sudden approximation .",
    "in order to measure the ratio of the neutron - capture cross - sections @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath30 and @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath5 at the thermal energy , two thin natural re foils were irradiated with thermal neutrons from the nuclear reactor jrr-4 at the japan atomic energy research institute ( jaeri ) .",
    "two al - co wires were also irradiated simultaneously to monitor the neutron flux .",
    "the samples were irradiated by the reactor neutrons for six hours .",
    "after the irradiation the samples were cooled in a water pool for about four months in order to reduce the background of the unstable isotopes with short half - lives .",
    "four and eight months after the irradiation , @xmath3-rays emitted from the activated samples were measured by two hpge detectors . in addition",
    "sixteen months later , the @xmath3-rays from one sample were measured by one hpge detector .",
    "the weights of the re foils are 43.8 mg and 58.1 mg , whereas the weights of the al - co wires are 1.74 mg and 4.58 mg .",
    "the co element composition is 0.475% .",
    "the natural re sample consists of two stable isotopes , namely @xmath2re ( 37.4% ) and @xmath1re ( 62.6% ) , and thus two unstable isotopes , @xmath0re and @xmath33re , are mainly produced by the neutron capture reactions .",
    "the half - lives of the ground states of these isotopes are @xmath34 days ( @xmath0re ) and @xmath35 hr ( @xmath33re ) , which are much shorter than the @xmath0re isomer .",
    "the average flux of the neutrons is estimated to be 4.37@xmath2110@xmath36 @xmath37s@xmath38 , which is evaluated by a measurement of decay @xmath3-rays after @xmath19-decay from the activated co in the wires .",
    "the @xmath3-rays from @xmath39al can not be measured because a cooling time of four months is much longer than the half - life of @xmath39al .",

    "its half - life is comparable to the cooling time , and hence the intensities are enhanced .",
    "however we observe a 137 kev transition of @xmath0os ( see fig .  4 ) , which is the strongest @xmath3-ray in the decay scheme associated with the isomer .",
    "the yield of the 137-kev @xmath3-ray is contributed not only from the isomer but also from the ground state produced directly by the @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath5 reaction .    in order to obtain the ratio of the neutron - capture cross section between the isomer and the ground state , we select the cooling time of four months after the irradiation for the first measurement . after the cooling , the ground state of @xmath0re is still remained because of its large capture cross - section relative to the isomer .",
    "although the surviving number of the ground state is small , the contribution to the 137 kev @xmath3-ray yield is competitive to the isomer because the decay rate of the ground state is much higher than the isomer . in the second and third measurements",
    "the ground states are not remained .",
    "the yields of the 137-kev @xmath3-ray at the second and third measurements are , thus , proportional to the neutron capture cross section to the isomer .",
    "the number of the nuclei produced by the neutron - capture reaction is proportional to the @xmath19-decay events , which are evaluated from the @xmath3-ray intensity in the measured spectra by applying the following equation of @xmath49 where @xmath50 means the total number of the @xmath19-decays , @xmath51 denotes the peak counts corresponding to the decay @xmath3-rays , @xmath52 the emission probability of the measured @xmath3-ray per decay , @xmath53 the efficiency of the hpge detectors and @xmath54 the correction of the @xmath19-decay during the measurement time .",

    "this fact indicates that the effect of the coriolis interaction on @xmath0re is smaller than that of @xmath111ta .",
    "we therefore assume that the transition between the ground state and the isomer via the ims can be ignored in the typical s - process environment .",
    "the measurement of the transition probability of @xmath0re may be important for the study of the s - process abundance of @xmath1re .",
    "the direct measurement of the transition probability is difficult because the isomer of @xmath0re does not exist in the solar system .",
    "a search for excited states by in - beam @xmath3-ray spectroscopy such as a measurement of excited states of @xmath1re  @xcite would be a further subject .",
    "the @xmath1re - @xmath1os chronometer is useful for the study of the age estimate of an r - process event .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to discuss the effect of the new s - process path on the @xmath1re - @xmath1os chronology .",
    "the contribution from the new s - process path through the @xmath0re isomer has been totally ignored in the past .",
    "we first present the age estimate without the effects of all weak s - process branchings .",
    "in such a case an age of an object which exhibits both the @xmath1re and @xmath1os abundances is calculated by    @xmath115 @xmath116    where @xmath117 means the observed abundance and @xmath118 means the abundance contributed from the s - process .",
    "note that we here adopt a simple model taking a sudden approximation that the r - process occurred at the look back time at @xmath119 = @xmath23 only once .",
    "although the sudden approximation is not generally a good approximation for analyses of the solar materials , it is still useful in analyses of primitive meteorites that have recently been found to be affected strongly by a single supernova r - process episode  @xcite .",
    "this approximation also applies to an analysis of astronomical date such as the abundances of the r - process elements detected in metal - poor stars with isotope separation because the elements on the surface of the old low - metallicity stars are probably generated in a single nucleosynthesis event  @xcite .",
    "we present the age estimation by taking into account the new s - process path to @xmath1re . in this case , eq .  ( [ eq : age1 ] ) should be replaced by    @xmath120 @xmath121    where we assume that the s - process occurred at different look back time @xmath122 from the r - process episode , i.e. @xmath123 , @xmath118 means the contribution by the s - process , @xmath117 means the observed abundance .",
    "the s - process contribution to @xmath1os should be modified by the change of the nucleosynthesis flow at @xmath0re . the s - process contribution to @xmath1re presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) @xmath11 ( [ eq:17 ] ) , which contain all the weak s - process paths . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) the contribution of the new s - process path is expressed by the term of @xmath52 .",
    "substituting the estimated macs ratio of @xmath9 = 1.3% at @xmath8= 30 kev , we obtain the results shown in tables [ table : age1 ] and [ table : age2 ] .",
    "the neutron capture cross sections at @xmath8 = 30 kev are taken from the previous article  @xcite .",
    "those of @xmath18os and @xmath1re are 418 , 874 , 1160 mbarn , respectively .",
    "we use the solar abundances for @xmath124(@xmath1re ) and @xmath124(@xmath1os ) .",
    "@xmath125(@xmath1os ) is calculated from the observed abundance @xmath124(@xmath0os ) = @xmath125(@xmath0os ) . the @xmath124(@xmath0os)/@xmath124(@xmath1re )",
    "ratios in the primitive meteorites or the metal - poor stars may be different from the solar abundance ratio because @xmath124(@xmath1re ) should be enhanced in the sample which is strongly affected by the single r - process event .",
    "we thus introduce a parameter , @xmath126 , which is defined by @xmath127 for allowing the variation of @xmath124(@xmath0os)/@xmath124(@xmath1re ) .",
    "the difference between the calculated ages for @xmath52 = 0 and 1.3% is at most @xmath11 1% in either case @xmath122=5@xmath2110@xmath128 yr ( table [ table : age1 ] ) or 10@xmath22 yr ( table [ table : age2 ] ) . the ages are slightly sensitive to the neutron density .",
    "aoki et al . reported isotope ratios of eu in s - process element rich metal - poor stars and show the possible neutron density range of the s - process environment by comparing their data with the s - process calculation : 10@xmath129 @xmath130 n @xmath130 10@xmath128 @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "thus we also present the age for the neutron density of 10@xmath129 @xmath101 as well as 10@xmath106 @xmath101 in tables [ table : age1 ] and [ table : age2 ] .",
    "the difference between the ages for two different neutron densities is at most @xmath11 2% .",
    "several metal - poor halo stars are thought to form from either the s - process element rich gas @xcite or the r - process element rich material @xcite , which are ejected from progenitor stars .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 can be even larger or smaller than unity .",
    "the primitive meteorites , which are affected by a single supernova r - process , can have the @xmath126 values smaller than unity .",
    "the column of @xmath126 in tables [ table : age1 ] and [ table : age2 ] shows this parameter .",
    "the estimated ages for @xmath52 = 0 and 1.3% under the conditions of @xmath131 1.0 show almost the same results because the absolute nucleosynthesis flow from the s - process decreases with decreasing the @xmath126 value .",
    "in particular , the ages become slightly different with increasing @xmath126 value for the case of @xmath122=10@xmath22 yr ( table [ table : age2 ] ) .",
    "although the effect of the new s - process path seems to be small , the effect is almost the same as those of the other s - process paths under the condition of @xmath126 @xmath130 1.0 .",
    "therefore the direct measurement of the absolute neutron capture cross section of @xmath2re leading to the isomer of @xmath0re at @xmath8=8@xmath1130 kev is important for the @xmath1re - @xmath1os chronometer .",
    "we propose a new s - process path that leads to synthesize @xmath1re and @xmath1os , which form an important nuclear - pair as a nucleo - cosmochronometer of the r - process .",
    "the new path consists of a neutron capture reaction chain from @xmath2re to the isomer of @xmath0re and from the @xmath0re isomer to @xmath1re , namely @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath4(n,@xmath3)@xmath1re , which has been ignored in all previous studies .",
    "we measure the ratio of the reaction cross sections @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath4 and @xmath2re(n,@xmath3)@xmath0re@xmath5 with thermal neutrons provided by a nuclear reactor at the jaeri .",
    "we measure @xmath3-rays after the @xmath19-decay from the re samples by hpge detectors and thereby we obtain the ratio of @xmath6 = 0.54 @xmath7 0.11% .",
    "the maxwellian averaged cross section reaction ratio at the stellar energy @xmath8 = 30 kev is estimated with the help of the statistical model calculation .",
    "the result is used to calculate the s - process abundance of @xmath1re relative to the abundance of @xmath0os in the classical steady - state flow model , which yielded a value of @xmath10 = 0.56 @xmath7 0.35% .",
    "the proposed new s - process path does not make any remarkable change in the @xmath1re-@xmath1os chronometer in the sudden approximation when all other possible s - process branchings are included in the calculation .",
    "this confirms the robustness of the @xmath1re-@xmath1os chronometer which applies to the age estimated by the analyses of primitive meteorites that are presumed to be affected strongly by a single supernova r - process episode .",
    "since the @xmath1re atom in these meteorites most likely has not been astrated in the stellar interior after it was produced in the r - process , the chronometer is free from the change of the half - life of ionized @xmath1re .",
    "we however need further experimental study to measure the cross section precisely at the stellar energy @xmath8=8@xmath1130 kev .",
    "we would like to thank k. takahashi , h. utsunomiya and m. fujiwara for valuable discussions .",
    "we also thank the crew of the nuclear reactor at jaeri . this work has been supported in part by grants - in - aid for scientific research ( 15740168 ) of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology of japan , and the mitsubishi foundation .",
