    "the outburst of the previously unknown variable star v838 monocerotis was discovered in 2002 january by brown ( 2002 ) . by early february v838",
    "mon reached 6th magnitude , but by 2002 may it had returned to quiescence at optical wavelengths . shortly after maximum light , an expanding light echo was discovered by henden , munari , & schwartz ( 2002 ) .",
    "these light echoes have evolved to become the most spectacular display of the phenomenon in astronomical history .",
    "they have been the subject of extensive imaging by ground - based observers ( e.g. , crause et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) and with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) ( bond et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "the eruption of v838 mon was of a very unusual type . in a classical - nova outburst ,",
    "the ejecta expand rapidly , become optically thin , and expose an extremely hot source .",
    "by contrast , v838  mon remained extremely cool throughout its outburst , becoming one of the coolest known stars  in fact it has been called the first l - type supergiant ( evans et al .",
    "in 2005 it developed rapidly strengthening sio maser emission ( claussen et al .",
    "a variety of explanations for the outburst have been proposed , many of them mutually exclusive ( see the recent summary in tylenda & soker 2006 , and the forthcoming proceedings of an international conference on v838  mon  corradi & munari 2006 ) .",
    "these explanations involve either thermonuclear processes ( an unusual nova - like outburst on a white dwarf , a thermonuclear event in a massive star , or a helium shell flash in a post - agb star ) , or the release of gravitational energy ( through stellar or planetary mergers or collisions ) .",
    "a possible new constraint on the nature of v838  mon came from the spectroscopic discovery of a b3  v companion to the variable star ( munari & desidera 2002 ; wagner & starrfield 2002 ) . the companion is unresolved even in _ hst _ images .",
    "light was dominated by the b3  v star , while the cool outbursting star dominated at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we detect no centroid shift of greater than @xmath5 between the blue and red images .",
    "] however , it is not close enough to the variable to have been engulfed when v838  mon expanded to a radius of several au .",
    "two other eruptive objects have attracted attention as possible analogs of v838  mon .",
    "one of them is the  m31 red variable , \" or `` m31 rv , '' which underwent an outburst in mid-1988 that was remarkably similar to that of v838  mon ( bond & siegel 2006 and references therein ) , although not as well observed .",
    "m31  rv occurred in the nuclear bulge of the andromeda galaxy , and is thus at a known distance .",
    "the other is v4332  sgr , a galactic object that had a nova - like outburst in 1994 during which it likewise remained very cool ( martini et al.1999 ; tylenda et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present our serendipitous discovery that v838  mon is a member of a small , young open cluster .",
    "we will use spectral classification and photometry of the cluster members to determine a distance , which we will compare with the direct geometric distance to v838  mon derived from _",
    "polarimetry of the light echoes .",
    "we will also derive a limit to the cluster s age , and will compare the stellar populations surrounding v838  mon and m31  rv .",
    "we will close with a brief discussion of the v838  mon progenitor object , its b3 companion , and some new constraints on the outburst mechanism that result from our observations .",
    "we have been monitoring the spectroscopic development of v838  mon since early 2003 , using the smarts 1.5-m telescope located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) and the boller & chivens ccd spectrograph .",
    "most of our observations have been obtained with a 600 groove  mm@xmath6 grating used in first order ( grating designation `` 26/i '' ) , yielding a fwhm resolution of 4.3    and a wavelength coverage of 35305300   .",
    "the ccd images are bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using standard iraf routines , and the spectra are then extracted from the images using the _ apall _ task .",
    "wavelength calibration is accomplished using he - ar comparison - lamp exposures taken before and after each stellar exposure .",
    "our data are long - slit spectra , in which the slit length projected onto the sky is about @xmath7 , in an east - west direction .",
    "it is not unusual for neighboring field stars to fall onto the slit , but we were surprised when a 16th - mag star lying on the slit almost directly east of v838  mon proved , entirely serendipitously , to have a b - type spectrum .",
    "although v838  mon lies at a low galactic latitude ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , a b - type star as faint as 16th  mag would lie at the outskirts of the galactic disk .",
    "this makes its existence very unusual , especially when lying within a few arcseconds of a star that is itself extraordinary . adding this to the fact that v838  mon has an unresolved b  companion made it appear very likely that the serendipitous star is at the same distance",
    "this in turn raised the possibility that there could be further faint early - type objects in the field surrounding v838  mon .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we have used the smarts 1.5-m telescope to obtain spectra of several more stars in the immediate vicinity of v838  mon . for these exploratory observations we used a 150 groove  mm@xmath6 grating ( designation `` 13/i '' ) , giving a resolution of 17.2    and coverage 31509375   .",
    "most of the neighboring stars have proven to be unrelated foreground stars , but our observations to date have disclosed two further 14th-15th mag b - type stars near v838  mon .",
    "all three of these early - type stars lie within @xmath0 of the variable , or within a projected separation of only 1.3  pc if the distance is @xmath106  kpc ( see below ) .",
    "thus there is little doubt that v838  mon is accompanied by a previously unrecognized sparse , young cluster .",
    "table  1 lists some properties of the new b - type stars near v838  mon .",
    "the coordinates are taken from the nomad-1.0 astrometric catalog ( zacharias et al.2004 ) .",
    "other information in table  1 is explained below .",
    "figure  1 presents a finding chart that identifies the new b  stars , using an arbitrary numbering scheme .",
    "star  7 is the serendipitous b star discovered first , lying nearly directly east of v838  mon ; the other two b stars are numbers 8 and  9 .",
    "all of the other numbered stars marked in figure  1 are unrelated foreground stars , based on our 1.5-m spectroscopic observations .",
    "( in addition , the bright star @xmath10@xmath11 to the northeast of star  4 has colors showing it to belong to the foreground , based on our photometry described below . )",
    "figure  1 illustrates that the cluster is not obvious in a direct image , and as we will see below the reddened b - type members and foreground f - g stars have similar colors ; hence spectroscopic observations are the only practical means for identifying cluster members in this crowded , low - latitude field .",
    "as this paper was being prepared , we became aware that wisniewski , bjorkman , & magalhes ( 2003 ; hereafter wbm2003 ) had already pointed out that our three stars are likely to lie at a similar distance to v838  mon itself , based on the similar polarimetric properties of all four stars .",
    "wisniewski et al .  used a different numbering scheme for these stars , and we give cross references to their star numbers in the second column of table  1 .",
    "photometry for the field surrounding v838  mon has been published by munari et  al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter m05 ) , and cross references to their numbering system are given in the third column of table  1 .",
    "following the serendipitous discovery of the first field b - type star , and our subsequent discoveries of two more b stars with the low - resolution 13/i grating setup , we obtained moderate - resolution of the latter two with the smarts 1.5-m spectrograph and the moderate - resolution 26/i grating . in figure  1",
    "we show these spectra , along with spectra of several classification standards taken with the same setup .",
    "the spectra of stars  8 and  9 are exposures of @xmath12  s and @xmath13  s , respectively , obtained in 2004 december , while the spectrum of star  7 is derived from 26/i spectra of v838  mon taken on 20 nights in 2003 - 2004 in which star  7 also lies on the slit . the exposures on v838  mon were typically @xmath14  s on each night , but since star  7 is not precisely east of the variable not all of its light falls within the slit .",
    "also included in figure  1 is a spectrum of v838  mon itself based on observations on five nights between 2003 february and may , a time when the variable had declined considerably from its 2002 outburst , but was still contributing some light even in this blue spectral range ( note the tio bands longward of h@xmath15 , for example ) .",
    "we classified the three b stars based both upon a visual comparison with the standard stars shown in figure  2 , and upon equivalent - width measurements of the and balmer lines .",
    "the results are given in table  1 and are believed to be accurate to better than one spectral subtype .",
    "we were not able to classify the unresolved b - type companion of v838  mon itself with these methods because of the contamination from the cool component .",
    "however , from a comparison of the equivalent widths of the bluest balmer lines ( h8 , h9 , and h10 ) in v838  mon ( where the contamination is lowest ) and in the standard stars , we find a type of b3  v. this agrees well with the other authors cited in  1 .",
    "we have also been monitoring the field of v838  mon regularly since early 2003 with the smarts 1.3-m telescope and the andicam optical / near - infrared direct camera ( depoy et  al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to derive calibrated photometry of the stars surrounding v838  mon ,",
    "we selected frames obtained on five photometric nights in 2003 - 2004 on which the ru  149 standard field from landolt ( 1992 ) had been observed at a similar airmass ( so as to essentially remove the dependence of the calibration upon variations in atmospheric extinction coefficients ) .",
    "we used standard iraf routines for bias subtraction and flat - fielding of the 2003 ccd frames ( starting in 2003 august , however , andicam data have been reduced through a pipeline at yale university before distribution to observers ) .",
    "we then used the iraf implementation of daophot ( stetson 1987 ) for star finding and to obtain point - spread - function ( psf ) instrumental magnitudes for the stars .",
    "these magnitudes were then transformed to the johnson @xmath16 system using the landolt standards .",
    "the results are given in table  2 .",
    "the internal errors in @xmath3 and @xmath17 are about @xmath180.004 and @xmath180.005  mag , respectively , for the two brighter stars , and about @xmath180.005 and @xmath180.007  mag , respectively , for star  7 . however , since typically only one landolt field was observed per night , the external errors are probably closer to @xmath180.01 - 0.02  mag .",
    "when we compared our photometry with that published by m05 for the same three stars , we found very large discrepancies ( up to @xmath100.7  mag in @xmath3 ) , and we also noted that unusually large errors are listed by m05 for two of the three stars",
    ". variability does not account for the large discrepancies , since we find constancy for all three stars , leaving us with no clear explanation .",
    "we have performed several checks on our photometric measurements , and are confident that our results are reliable .",
    "we can now calculate distances to each of the three b stars , and thus determine a distance to the cluster .",
    "details of the calculations are given in table  2 .",
    "the first four columns repeat the star designations , spectral types , and photometry from table  1 .",
    "the fifth column gives the intrinsic color corresponding to each spectral type , @xmath19 , taken from the tabulation of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the sixth column gives the estimated color excess , @xmath20 .",
    "the color excesses agree well among the three stars , with a mean of @xmath21 and a scatter of about @xmath180.02  mag .",
    "this determination agrees well with those of other authors .",
    "for example m05 found @xmath22 using several different methods .",
    "tylenda ( 2005 ) discusses recent reddening determinations by several authors , and adopts @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these authors have given high weight to methods based on the unresolved b3 companion of v838  mon , which ( as discussed below ) may suffer some local extinction in addition to foreground interstellar extinction .    the next column in table  2",
    "gives the magnitude of each star corrected for extinction , @xmath24 , calculated assuming @xmath25 .",
    "column  8 gives the absolute magnitude corresponding to each spectral type , @xmath26 , again taken from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "the final column gives the distance moduli , @xmath27 , whose mean is 14.0 , or a distance of 6.3  kpc .",
    "the cluster distance modulus has an internal error of about @xmath180.2  mag , based on the scatter among the three stars .",
    "however , systematic errors are undoubtedly larger .",
    "this is indicated by the scatter among different calibrations of the relation between spectral types and absolute magnitudes ( e.g. , lesh 1968 ; schmidt - kaler 1982 ; cramer 1997 ) , which amounts typically to about @xmath180.4  mag . at a distance of 6.3  kpc",
    ", this corresponds to an error of @xmath181.2  kpc .      we can also estimate the distance to our cluster through photometric main - sequence fitting . in the absence of any spectroscopic information",
    ", this method would suffer from the well - known near - degeneracy between extinction and distance for early - type stars ; this is due to fact that the main sequence lies along a steep , nearly straight line in the @xmath28 diagram .",
    "however , with the additional constraints from the spectral types , main - sequence fitting become possible .    to define the main sequence , we chose the lightly reddened open cluster ngc  2362 , which , at an age of @xmath105  myr , has been described as a template for early stellar evolution ( moitinho et  al .  2001 ; hereafter mahl01 ) .",
    "this cluster s unevolved main sequence extends to type b1  v ( johnson & morgan 1953 ) .",
    "we took @xmath29 photometry for ngc  2362 from johnson & morgan and from perry ( 1973 ) , and adopted @xmath30 and @xmath31  kpc from mahl01 .",
    "we then corrected the photometry to the spectroscopic reddening and distance for the v838  mon cluster found above .",
    "the match with the three v838  mon b stars was very good , so we applied just one iteration of adjusting first the reddening of the b stars and then the distance , so as to improve the fit .",
    "this resulted in a v838  mon cluster reddening of @xmath2 and distance modulus @xmath32 ( @xmath33  kpc ) .",
    "the external errors here are similar to those for the spectroscopic parallax , since mahl01 based the distance to ngc  2362 on the schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) zero - age main sequence .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the @xmath28 values for the three b stars as large filled blue circles .",
    "the small open red circles are the johnson - morgan and perry photometry of ngc  2362 , adjusted to the v838  mon reddening and distance found in the previous paragraph .",
    "the fit is excellent , and strongly supports the conclusion that our three b stars do form a physical cluster .    a direct geometrical distance determination for v838",
    "mon has been carried out by sparks et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based on polarimetric imaging of the light echo obtained with _",
    "this result , 5.9  kpc , is in excellent agreement with our determination of 6.2  kpc based on the associated b - type stars .",
    "also plotted in figure  3 , as small filled black circles , is our photometry for all stars within a radius of @xmath34 of v838  mon . for most of these stars",
    "we do not know whether they are cluster members or not , but we do have smarts 1.5-m spectra for six of them that establish them as belonging to the foreground ; these non - members are marked with black stars in figure  3 , and they are numbered in the finding chart in figure  1 .",
    "as figure  3 shows , the foreground f- and g - type stars have similar colors to the reddened b - type cluster members .",
    "this demonstrates that spectroscopic observations are essential to the identification of cluster members",
    ". it would be very interesting to have spectra of the other stars in the vicinity of v838  mon , especially below @xmath35 , where the slope of the main sequence changes ; any of these candidates that proved to be cluster members would provide tighter constraints on the cluster reddening and distance .",
    "we can compare the luminosity of v838  mon with that of the apparently similar object m31  rv ( see  1 ) . at maximum light ( 2002 february 6 ) v838  mon had @xmath36 ( m05 , their figure  1 ) .",
    "for the reddening and distance derived here , this corresponds to an absolute blue magnitude at maximum of @xmath37 .",
    "the brightest @xmath38 magnitude measured for m31  rv during its 1988 outburst was 17.3 ( bryan & royer 1992 ; boschi & munari 2004 ) .",
    "the latter authors , adopting @xmath39 and @xmath40 for m31 , found an absolute magnitude of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the light curve of m31  rv was very poorly sampled around its maximum .",
    "it is more meaningful to compare the luminosities of the two objects at the same well - covered portions of both light curves .",
    "referring to figure  2 of boschi & munari ( 2004 ) , and using their light curves in kron - cousins @xmath42 , we can compare the luminosities at a point just before the rapid fading in the @xmath42 band . for m31  rv ,",
    "this brightness is @xmath43 , and for v838  mon it is @xmath44 . correcting for reddening and distance , the corresponding absolute magnitudes are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "thus , at least at this stage in their outbursts , the absolute luminosities were nearly identical .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , the spectra of our three b - type stars exhibit conspicuous diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) features centered near 4428   .",
    "we measure the average equivalent width of the 4428    dib in these three stars to be about 3.1   .",
    "snow , zukowski , & massey ( 2002 , their fig .",
    "6 ) show that there is a correlation between the dib equivalent width and the amount of interstellar extinction in a large sample of galactic stars , but with considerable scatter . at a reddening of @xmath2 ,",
    "our mean equivalent width is at the upper envelope of the values plotted by snow et  al .",
    "these strong dibs will provide a useful spectroscopic discriminant in future attempts to identify faint members of the v838  mon cluster .",
    "since the three b stars all appear to lie on the zero - age main sequence , we can only set an upper limit to the age of the v838  mon cluster .",
    "by reference to the isochrones and evolutionary tracks of pientrinfini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that this upper limit is about 25  myr . according to these isochrones , the masses of stars  7 , 8 , and 9 are about 4.7 , 6.4 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "v838  mon is accompanied by a previously reported , unresolved b3  v companion . in this paper",
    "we have shown that v838  mon also belongs to a sparse cluster , containing at least three other members , lying at the outer edge of the milky way disk .",
    "the main sequence of this cluster extends up to spectral type b3  v , implying an age of less than 25  myr .",
    "we could thus be tempted to speculate that the outburst of v838  mon in 2002 represents an evolutionary event that occurs in stars of masses @xmath487@xmath49 .",
    "we could even speculate that such events occur in stars whose masses lie near the dividing line between those that explode as type  ii supernovae and those that become white dwarfs more quiescently .",
    "unfortunately , such a speculation appears to be dashed by the recent study of m31  rv by bond & siegel ( 2006 ) .",
    "they used archival _",
    "images that serendipitously included the outburst site of m31  rv , and showed that the population surrounding the object contains exclusively old , low - mass stars belonging to the nuclear bulge of m31 .",
    "there is no young population at all at this site , let alone bright b stars younger than 25  myr .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , tylenda , soker , & szczerba 2005 and references therein ) have attempted to determine the brightness of v838  mon before its 2002 outburst .",
    "the available material for such a determination at optical wavelengths comes from the various photographic sky surveys , and from sky - patrol photographic plates .",
    "archival patrol plates show that the star did not vary over the interval from 1928 to 1994 ( goranskij et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however , kimeswenger & eyres ( 2006 ) have provided evidence suggesting that there was some fading of v838  mon in the late 1990 s , shortly before the onset of the outburst .    in an analysis of high - resolution digitizations of a serc survey plate obtained in 1983 with a j emulsion , kimeswenger & eyres ( 2006 ) report that",
    "v838  mon had a @xmath50 magnitude of @xmath51 . adopting a transformation equation of @xmath52 ( bacher , kimeswenger , & teutsch 2005 and references therein ) , and assuming that v838  mon at that time had the same @xmath17 color as our star  9 , we find that its @xmath38 magnitude in 1983 was 15.66 .",
    "( goranskij et al .",
    "2004 , in an independent analysis based on the lower - resolution scans of the plate material available in the digitized sky survey , find a slightly fainter pre - outburst value of @xmath53 . )",
    "the companion of v838  mon , if it is a normal b3  v star , would be expected to have a luminosity similar to that of our star  9 , also classified b3  v. according to our photometry ( table  1 ) , star  9 has a @xmath38 magnitude of 15.41 .",
    "this is in fact slightly brighter than the actual pre - outburst @xmath38 magnitude of v838  mon found above , suggesting that _ the progenitor of the outbursting object contributed a negligible fraction of the pre - eruption light . _",
    "( even if the unresolved companion were in fact more similar to our slightly later star  8 , which we classified b4  v and has @xmath54 , it still would have contributed _ all _ of the pre - outburst light . )",
    "it is well established that when v838  mon subsided back to quiescence ( at optical wavelengths ) in mid-2002 , it was significantly fainter than before the outburst ( see , for example , the light curves in figure  1 of m05 , and those given by goranskij et al .",
    "this faintness has continued to the present time ; for example , our own recent smarts 1.3-m observation , obtained on 2006 february 19 , shows v838  mon at @xmath55 .",
    "( actually , this is an upper limit to the current brightness of the b3 star , since there is some contribution of light from the outbursting companion ; however , our spectrum of v838  mon in figure  2 indicates that the contribution in the @xmath38 band is relatively small . )    in order to explain this fading by @xmath101  mag , several authors have argued that the progenitor of the outbursting object contributed significant optical light to the pre - outburst magnitude , and that this extra light is now absent or diminished .",
    "m05 , for example , concluded that one component of the binary was a massive star that underwent a thermonuclear event in 2002 .",
    "our observations and distance / reddening determination , however , indicate that the pre - outburst optical light can be attributed _ entirely _ to the b3 companion , and we know that this companion _ is still present_. the actual issue , then , is to explain why the b3 star is now about one magnitude fainter at @xmath38 than it was before the eruption .",
    "we suggest that the explanation is rather prosaic : the b3 companion is close enough to the outbursting component that it is partially submerged in the dust that is being produced copiously and is relatively slowly flowing away from v838  mon .",
    "( barsukova et al .",
    "2006 as well as our own smarts spectra ) .",
    "barsukova et al .",
    "attribute the excitation of these lines to the b3 star , and suggest this indicates that outburst ejecta have reached the vicinity of the b star . ] ( alternatively , the b3 star could be _ behind _ the cool supergiant , with its light shining through the dust envelope . )",
    "if this is true , then we do not need to account for any extra light in the system before the 2002 outburst .",
    "this appears to rule out the presence of any star as massive as star  9 , either near the main sequence or in an evolved , even more luminous state ( as was proposed by m05 ) .",
    "the b3 companion would also be expected to be reddened by a larger amount than the cluster , if our scenario is correct .",
    "however , it is difficult to isolate the color of the b3 star at the present time , because v838  mon itself still contributes significantly to the system light at the @xmath3 band and longward .",
    "our observations have revealed that v838  mon belongs to a young cluster .",
    "this discovery has , however , only deepened the enigma of v838  mon and the similar object m31  rv , because we now know that the former arose from a very young population , whereas the latter belongs to a very old population .",
    "what , then , was the nature of the progenitor objects that produced the outbursts of v838  mon and m31  rv ?",
    "they apparently can exist at both ends of the range of stellar ages .",
    "the luminosity of the progenitor before outburst , at least in the case of v838  mon , was small compared to that of a b3 dwarf .",
    "that would be consistent with the low luminosity of a typical nova - like cataclysmic variable .",
    "however , the young age of the v838  mon cluster would appear to rule out the evolutionary timescale required to produce an accreting white dwarf in a compact binary , a requirement of a nova - like outburst mechanism .",
    "it may be that the stellar - merger scenario advocated in a recent series of papers ( e.g. , tylenda & soker 2006 and references therein ; see also retter et al .",
    "2006 , who advocate a planet - star merger ) can satisfy these new constraints , provided that collisions between low - mass stars ( which exist in all populations ) could produce the required high luminosities , and can be shown to occur often enough . at the moment , however , the nature of these extraordinary outbursts remains one of the leading unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics .",

    "<S> v838  monocerotis is an unusual variable star that underwent a sudden outburst in 2002 . unlike a classical nova , which quickly evolves to high temperatures , v838  mon remained an extremely cool , luminous supergiant throughout its eruption . </S>",
    "<S> it continues to illuminate a spectacular series of light echoes , as the outburst light is scattered from nearby circumstellar dust . v838  </S>",
    "<S> mon has an unresolved b3  v companion star .    during a program of spectroscopic monitoring of v838  mon </S>",
    "<S> , we serendipitously discovered that a neighboring 16th - mag star is also of type  b. we then carried out a spectroscopic survey of other stars in the vicinity , revealing two more b - type stars , all within @xmath0 of v838  mon . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the distance to this sparse , young cluster , based on spectral classification and photometric main - sequence fitting of the three b  stars . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster distance is found to be @xmath1  kpc , in excellent agreement with the geometric distance to v838  mon of 5.9  kpc obtained from _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> polarimetry of the light echoes . </S>",
    "<S> an upper limit to the age of the cluster is about 25  myr , and its reddening is @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the absolute luminosity of v838  mon during its outburst , based on our distance measurement , was very similar to that of m31  rv , an object in the bulge of m31 that was also a cool supergiant throughout its eruption in 1988 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no young population at the site of m31  rv .    using our distance determination </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the b3  v companion of v838  mon is sufficient to account for the entire luminosity of the variable star measured on sky - survey photographs before its outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the b3 star is currently , however , about 1  mag fainter than before the eruption , suggesting that it is now suffering extinction due to dust ejected from v838  mon . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that , whatever the nature of the progenitor object , it was not of high luminosity . nor does it appear possible to form a nova - like cataclysmic binary system within the young age of the v838  mon cluster . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations appear to leave stellar - collision or -merger scenarios as one of the remaining viable explanations for the outbursts of v838  mon and m31  rv . </S>"
