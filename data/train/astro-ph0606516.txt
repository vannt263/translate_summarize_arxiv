    "when a scientist tries to analyze a given observed data set , it is customary to begin by examining the data in various ways , such as plotting the data and looking for patterns . in a second step ,",
    "the scientist proposes a number of physically plausible models that can reproduce the observed data set .",
    "a model fitting procedure is then applied to the data set so that the parameters that characterize each model are inferred .",
    "after all the proposed models are fitted to the data , the next step is to compare them and infer which of the fitted models is the most suitable .",
    "methods for such a task have been developed .",
    "for instance , for models that represent a hierarchical structure , we can use akaike s information criterion @xcite or mallows @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these methods can be applied even in the case that the set of proposed models does not contain the perfect model . in this case , the aim is to select the most optimal one . if the models are of completely different type and do not belong to a hierarchical structure of models , cross - validation type methods can be applied .",
    "however , they can be computationally demanding .    the standard procedure to select the optimum model is to make use of the occam s razor principle ( also known as the principle of parsimony ) .",
    "this principle is commonly applied in science and is usually thought to be an heuristic approach for eliminating unnecessary complex hypothesis .",
    "the principle states that the selected model has to provide an equilibrium between the model complexity and its fidelity to the data . nevertheless , determining the simplest model is often very complicated .",
    "it is usually argued that the number of parameters that parameterizes the model should be smaller than the number of degrees of freedom of the data .",
    "however , it is a difficult matter to estimate the number of degrees of freedom of the data .    an alternative and successful procedure is to consider the problem in terms of a communication process .",
    "assume that a sender s is interested in sending a given observation to a receiver r. several techniques are available for such a task .",
    "the most trivial one is to send the whole amount of data through a given channel .",
    "if the data set is very large , the length of the message will be consequently very large . if s is able to model the observation using a given model , it is wiser and shorter to transmit the model followed by the points in the observation that are not correctly reproduced by the model .",
    "if the model is good and simple enough , the length of the message between s and r will be much shorter than sending the complete observed data set .",
    "this compression will be degraded when the model needed for explaining the observations is made unnecessarily complex .",
    "@xcite was the first in suggesting that the code length could be used for model comparison .",
    "this principle is nowadays known as the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle , which states that we should _ choose the model that gives the shortest description of the data_. in this framework , there is an interplay between models that are concise and easy to describe and models that produce a good fit to the data set and captures the important features evident in the data .",
    "of course , this is neither the only nor the best strategy for such purposes .",
    "however , its application is desirable in comparison with ad - hoc or trial - and - error ways of performing model selection .",
    "the reason is that mdl principle has strong theoretical roots that lie on the kolmogorov complexity theory @xcite .",
    "as we will show , the practical application of the mdl principle is very easy to implement and it constitutes an ideal approach for model selection .",
    "this paper will be focused on one of the version of the mdl principle , the so - called two - part mdl .",
    "this strategy was developed by rissanen in a series of papers published during the seventies and eighties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and summarized in @xcite . we give a brief summary of the main results in section [ sec : theory ] . as shown below , the main idea is to write the description length of a given model applied to a data set as the sum of the length of the code for describing the model and the length of the code for describing the data set fitted by the model .    the interpretation of spectropolarimetric data in solar and stellar observations allows to infer information about the properties of the magnetic field .",
    "almost always , the recovery of the magnetic field vector is based on the assumption of a model .",
    "these models depend on a given amount of variables that can be estimated by fitting the observed stokes profiles . among these models",
    ", we can find the milne - eddington approximation , the lte approximation , the misma hypothesis @xcite , etc .",
    "sometimes , it is clear that a model is the most appropriate when observational clues are available .",
    "however , it is customary that these clues are not present and one relies on one model based on completely or partially subjective reasons .",
    "some of these models are based on an extraordinarily large number of parameters . until now , there is not any critical investigation toward analyzing whether enough information is available in the observations to constraint such a large amount of parameters .",
    "this work is a first step in this direction .",
    "we propose the application of the mdl criterion to quantitatively differentiate between possible models taking into account the information available in the observations .",
    "@xcite related the problem of finite dimensional parameter estimation to the problem of designing an optimal encoding scheme .",
    "we consider the problem of transmitting a set of data from a sender s to a receiver r. the sender must first communicate the type of model that can be used for describing the data .",
    "consider , for instance , a set of points that we want to fit with a polynomial model . in this case , neither the order of the polynomial @xmath1 , nor the value of the parameters of the polynomial @xmath2 are known , so that this constitutes an extremely ill - posed problem .",
    "however , the mdl principle can be used to find the `` most plausible '' model that explains the observed points . in the first step",
    ", the sender has to communicate the order of the polynomial @xmath1 .",
    "when the sender and the receiver agree on the type of model to use , the sender has to communicate the model itself , sending through the channel the @xmath1 parameters @xmath3 . if noise is present or if the proposed model is incomplete , the sender has to additionally communicate the deviations of the model from the data",
    ".    the question of simplicity can consequently be tackled by taking advantage of the work of @xcite .",
    "each model is reduced to bits , the most fundamental information unit .",
    "this allowed to transform the occam s razor principle into a completely functional principle .",
    "the measure of simplicity is just the number of bits required to correctly and univoquely transmit a set of observations by using a model .",
    "the sender s takes a set of observations as input , encodes and sends a message that contains all the information about the model and the data to the receiver r. finally , the receiver decodes the message and produces an output . in information - preserving encoding schemes ,",
    "the output obtained by r has to be identical to the original observation performed by s. let @xmath4 be a set of observations ( dataset ) and @xmath5 a model that is used to describe them .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 represents the length of the code in bits necessary to encode the model @xmath5 .",
    "as well , @xmath7 represents the length of the data encoded using the model @xmath5 ( this term can be alternatively seen as the residual between the data @xmath4 and the model @xmath5 ) .",
    "the total length of the message is : @xmath8 the mdl principle tries to minimize @xmath9 and the model associated with this minimum length is selected as the most plausible model .",
    "the previous analysis can be alternatively viewed from the bayesian perspective ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the aim is to infer a model @xmath5 from a set of observations @xmath4 .",
    "the solution lies in choosing the model that maximizes the posterior probability @xmath10 , which can be expressed as follows with the aid of the bayes theorem : @xmath11 the term @xmath12 can be considered as a normalizing factor and represents the probability that the data set @xmath4 occurs .",
    "the term @xmath13 is the a priori probability of the model , that is , the probability that the model @xmath5 is true before any data set has been observed .",
    "finally , @xmath14 is the likelihood of the data given the model @xmath5 .",
    "the relationship between the mdl formalism given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : length ] ) and the bayes formalism given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayes ] ) is obtained by making use of shannon s optimal coding theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the length of the ideal code for a value @xmath15 of a variable @xmath16 which follows from a known probability distribution @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18 taking the negative logarithm of eq . (",
    "[ eq : bayes ] ) , we obtain : @xmath19 the most plausible model is the one that minimizes @xmath20 , that is , the one that minimizes @xmath21 .",
    "note that we have ignored the influence of @xmath12 since it is a constant that is shared for all the models and it is only associated with the data set . according to shannon s theorem , the minimization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayes_log ] ) is equivalent to the minimization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : length ] ) .",
    "shannon s theorem states the length of the optimal code needed for transmitting a given number @xmath15 whose probability distribution is known .",
    "although extremely important , the theorem can be useless because this probability distribution is usually not known and only approximate values of the length of the message can be obtained .",
    "an example is when one needs to transmit a set of integer or real numbers for which no probability distribution is known .",
    "it has been demonstrated that knowing exactly the encoding scheme is of accesory importance @xcite .",
    "what is fundamental to know is which model gives the minimal length of the message given an arbitrary encoding scheme . in the following , we assume that the probability distribution is not known and we present existing estimations for the length of the message needed for communicating integer and real numbers .",
    "these formulae represent the first estimations that were obtained for the lengths of the message for communicating models @xcite .",
    "since they are not based on any probability distribution for the integer or real numbers , they are known as universal priors @xcite .",
    "assume that we want to encode an integer number @xmath22 in its binary representation .",
    "the binary representation of @xmath22 has a length that can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath23 bits .",
    "if a set of integers are to be encoded , confusion arises if we pack all these binary digits together because the receiver does not know where the representation of the first digit ends and the second digit starts . to resolve this",
    ", one can also encode the length of the binary representation of @xmath22 in binary representation , whose length can also be estimated to be @xmath24 .",
    "the same problem arises again since the receiver does not know the length of this preamble representation .",
    "this problem can be solved by giving the length of the preamble as @xmath25 as another preamble .",
    "this procedure can be iterated until @xmath26 is as close to zero ( and positive ) as desired .",
    "the integer number can be encoded with a scheme that includes these preambles , so that the total length of the code is given by : @xmath27 where the constant @xmath28 is included for consistency ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the symbol @xmath29 is chosen to represent the previous sum . for large numbers , the dominant factor is @xmath23 , so that we can approximately assume that the length of the message for encoding an integer number is of the order of @xmath23 for sufficiently large @xmath22 @xcite . for encoding integers with sign",
    ", we can add a single bit for setting the sign , so that the length of the message is @xmath30 .",
    "the dominant factor is again @xmath23 .",
    "encoding real numbers is more complicated than integer numbers because we would need an infinite number of bits to encode the real number to infinite precision . to solve this in practice",
    ", we have to encode the real number @xmath15 assuming a precision @xmath31 , so that the encoded number @xmath32 fulfills @xmath33 .",
    "once the precision is fixed , we can encode the integer part @xmath34 and the fractional part of @xmath32 separately .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the length of the message is @xmath35 . as stated before , if @xmath15 is large and taking into account that @xmath36 , we can estimate the length of the message for encoding a real number @xmath15 with @xmath37 note that the length tends to zero when the number to encode approaches the precision . in the limit situation that @xmath15 is smaller than the precision , the length takes a negative value that does not have meaning .    with the previous considerations in mind",
    ", the model selection problem can be established .",
    "let @xmath38 be the model that generates the data or the one that is more plausible and that it belongs to a class of @xmath39 models @xmath5 .",
    "consider that each model is parameterized by @xmath40 parameters @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "given a set of observations , our aim is to choose the most plausible model @xmath38 from the set @xmath5 and to estimate the parameters @xmath44 .",
    "the sender splits up the message in two parts .",
    "the first one contains the model itself and the second one contains the departures between the model and the data .",
    "we transmit the information about the model by first encoding the number of parameters that characterizes it and then transmitting the parameters themselves with a given precision @xmath45 associated with each one : @xmath46.\\ ] ] since the @xmath29 function behaves as @xmath23 for sufficiently large @xmath22 @xcite , we can transform the previous formula to : @xmath47.\\ ] ] the previous equation gives the length of the model for encoding the parameters with arbitrary precision @xmath45 .",
    "however , it makes no sense to increase the precision of the parameters unnecessarily because there may be no information in the data for such a task .",
    "it has been demonstrated by @xcite that if the optimum parameters are computed from a large set of @xmath22 observed data points , the precision of the parameters can be effectively encoded with only @xmath48 bits .",
    "the reason for this is that , if the parameters are being estimated from the data , it makes no sense to encode them with a precision larger than the standard error of the estimation . for a typical estimation of the @xmath41 parameter ,",
    "the standard error decreases with the number of data points as @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the code length for encoding a real number with precision @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "if all the points are used for estimating all the parameters , we can rewrite eq . ( [ eq : length_n_params2 ] ) as : @xmath51    additionally , we have to encode the observed data given the model to obtain the length @xmath7 . in the simple case in which we do not have any information about the probability distribution of the data given the model",

    "we assume that integer numbers are saved in a computer using @xmath59 bits , while real numbers are saved in the memory of the computer using @xmath60 bits .",
    "usually , integer numbers are saved using @xmath61 bits , while real numbers can be stored using either @xmath62 or @xmath63 bits depending on the desired precision .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the length of the message that describes the model ( the number of bits required for its storage in the memory of the computer ) by : @xmath64 where the number of bits required for transmitting the number of parameters given by @xmath65 can be usually neglected with respect to the length of the message used for transmitting the parameters themselves . concerning the storage of the data , we consider that the model output is correct when the residual is smaller than a given precision threshold @xmath31 . if the model output is incorrect , we store the difference as a real number with @xmath60 bits , so that the length is given by : @xmath66 the length of the parameters associated with the model increase linearly with the number of parameters , while the length of the data set decreases , with a slope that depends on how well the model fits the data .",
    "the previous encoding schemes have been obtained using universal priors , thus assuming no knowledge at all about the distribution of the values of the data and/or model . however ,",
    "if some information about the probability distribution is known , it can be incorporated in the description of the encoding length through eq .",

    "our aim is to apply the mdl criterion systematically to other similar problems in the future .      as a first application",
    ", we consider the case of principal component analysis ( pca ) de - noising of spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the dataset consists on full - stokes observations of the two at 15648   and 15652   in an extremely quiet region of the solar surface .",
    "this dataset has been used by @xcite to investigate the magnetic properties of the quiet sun .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the observations have been improved by using the pca de - noising technique .",
    "pca is a statistical technique that , given a data set , produces a set of orthogonal vectors and eigenvalues that can be used for decomposing the original data .",
    "these eigenvectors point in the directions of maximum covariance .",
    "the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue points along the direction with the largest covariance in the data and so on .",
    "pca provides an `` optimal '' basis set for decomposing ( and reconstructing ) the data set .",
    "alternatively , it has been used for compressing data ( by saving only the eigenvalues and eigenvectors ) or for efficiently inverting stokes profiles @xcite . for computing the pca decomposition ,",
    "the covariance matrix of the observations has to be diagonalized .",
    "once the eigenvectors @xmath86 ( vectors whose dimension @xmath87 equal the number of wavelenghts in the dataset ) and eigenvalues @xmath88 of the covariance matrix associated with the stokes parameter @xmath89 are obtained , any of the stokes profiles can be decomposed as : @xmath90 where the subindex",
    "@xmath91 refers to the wavelength position .",
    "the previous equation can be alternatively seen as a technique for reconstructing the original signal from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained after the pca decomposition .",
    "the precision of the reconstruction can be modified by changing the value of the number of eigenvectors included ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the pca reconstruction assures that the error of the reconstruction decreases when more eigenvectors are included .",
    "the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues represent the features that are more statistically representative of the dataset , while the noise and particular features are accounted for by the eigenvectors with the smallest eigenvalues . as a consequence , it is possible to get rid of the majority of the noise in the observation by stopping the summation of eq .",

    "of course , this threshold should be chosen consistent with the expected noise in the observations .",
    "the diagnostic of magnetic fields via the interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations is often based on the assumption of a model .",
    "sometimes , the observations themselves do not carry enough information for discriminating among several models .",
    "a similar problem arises when a model can have an arbitrarily large number of parameters and it is not an easy task to select an optimum value of such parameters .",

    "this is not generally the case since stokes i can be also sensitive to the magnetic field in the strong field regime . in analysing internetwork quiet sun stokes profiles , the filling factor of the magnetic component needs to be very small . in such a situation , the emergent stokes i profile fundamentally depends on the properties of the non - magnetic component , while the emergent stokes v profile depends only on the properties of the magnetic component .",

    "the selection of the optimal number of pca components when de - noising observed stokes profiles and the selection of the optimal number of nodes in the temperature and magnetic field depth profile obtained from lte inversion of stokes profiles .",
    "the results show the potential of this technique for model selection , with the advantage of being very simple to calculate .    as the main conclusion of this paper , we propose using the mdl principle as a way to quantitatively select among different competing models .",
    "we propose to include the description length as one of the final outputs of any inversion code .",
    "this makes it very easy to select the optimal model from a proposed set of models based on the framework of the mdl principle .",
    "it is of interest to stress that this principle can be used to select among models that are based on different scenarios .",
    "usually , most complex scenarios translate into more degrees of freedom that may not be constrained by the observations . using the mdl principle , the selected model among all the possibilities might not give the best fit to the observations but it represents the model that produces a good fit with a conservative number of parameters .",
    "as a final remark , a possible future way of research may be how the mdl principle can be implemented as a regularization of the merit function in the existing inversion techniques . as a consequence",
    ", one would end up with an inversion code that automatically selects the optimal model .",
