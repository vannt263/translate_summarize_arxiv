    "since its inception , the inflationary universe scenario @xcite has widely come to be accepted as one of the most promising phenomenological models of the early universe that successfully accounts for the initial conditions of the hot big bangcdm model which purports to account for most cosmological observations , the simplest models of inflation typically account for one ( the spectral tilt ) and post - fit another ( the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum ) .",
    "in contrast , in certain examples of putative models where the universe bounces or is emergent , the amplitude is also fixed by the characteristic scales of the underlying dynamics @xcite . ] . however , the paradigm is not without its conceptual @xcite as well as technical problems , and thus it is of more than just academic interest to study the possibility of alternative cosmological scenarios .",
    "notable attempts motivated by string or m - theory towards this end include @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been some developments in a specific class of non - singular ) remains finite in the einstein frame , although the extrinsic curvature does jump , sourced by a distributional source .",
    "] bouncing string cosmologies @xcite , and in earlier emergent scenarios , see e.g. @xcite . with respect to the former , it has been realized @xcite that initial quantum vacuum fluctuations that exit the hubble radius during a matter - dominated contracting phase acquire a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations on super - hubble scales , representing a _ duality _ of backgrounds that generates the same two point correlation functions @xcite@xmath0 .    in order to propagate the initial spectrum of fluctuations in the contracting or emergent phase on to the final expanding phase , it is necessary to understand their evolution at the transition point .",
    "note that this transition must involve new physics which violates the null energy condition ( nec ) . in the context of bouncing universes , the matching of fluctuations between the phases was studied in a number of specific models in which the bounce was obtained by introducing ghost matter @xcite ( where stability issues for the background are not considered ) and ghost condensate @xcite or galileon @xcite constructions ( where meta - stable violations of the nec are possible ) .",
    "additionally , other models consider modifying gravity at high curvature scales such as in the non - local model of @xcite , in hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite or in mirage cosmology @xcite .    in all of these examples",
    "it was found that on large scales ( length scales larger than the time - scale when the new physics is dominant ) the spectrum of the dominant mode of fluctuations is unchanged across the bounce . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known from studies done in different contexts @xcite that the transition can depend sensitively on details of the background bouncing solution .    in this paper , we study the transition of fluctuations between the contracting and expanding phases in cosmological backgrounds arising from specific string theoretic constructions @xcite in which the bounce is mediated via a stringy s - brane .",
    "our results show that indeed a scale invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations can manifest at late times , given vacuum initial conditions , in a stringy realization of the  matter bounce \" scenario @xcite .",
    "the detailed manner however in which this happens crucially depends on the microphysical realization of the s - brane as a space - filling condensate of non - trivial , massless thermal string states , appearing at the instant the universe attains a critical maximal temperature , reinforcing the message of @xcite .",
    "our work thus lays the basis for studying the evolution of cosmological fluctuations in general models in which the transition between the phases of contraction and expansion is described by stringy s - branes .",
    "specifically , we will study scalar metric fluctuations ( see @xcite for an in - depth survey of the theory of cosmological fluctuations and @xcite for an introductory overview ) . in both the contracting and expanding phases of the induced cosmology",
    ", the gravitational potential @xmath1 obeys an equation of motion which for each fourier mode , labeled by co - moving wavenumber @xmath2 , is a second order ordinary differential equation and hence has two linearly independent solutions . in the expanding phase ,",
    "the dominant mode is constant on super - hubble scales and the second mode is decaying in time . in the contracting phase",
    "there is a growing mode in time and a second constant mode .    in the case of the toy bouncing models mentioned above",
    ", it is found that on scales much larger than the duration of the  new physics phase \" , the coupling between the growing mode in the contracting phase and the dominant mode in the expanding phase is highly suppressed , leading to the conclusion that the spectrum of @xmath1 at late times in the expanding phase is determined by the spectrum of the constant mode in the contracting phase . as shown by durrer and vernizzi @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , in the case of an instantaneous transition between contraction and expansion , the generalization of the israel junction conditions @xcite to spacelike hypersurfaces @xcite implies that the coupling of the growing mode in the contracting phase to the constant mode in the expanding period is _ not _ suppressed unless the matching surface is a constant energy density surface .",
    "this result had important implications for the transfer of fluctuations through examples such as an ekpyrotic bounce .",
    "simple four - dimensional single matter component effective field theory analyses assumed a matching on constant energy density slices @xcite and obtained a deeply blue spectrum of final curvature fluctuations starting from vacuum perturbations in the contracting ekpyrotic phase .",
    "by contrast , in this paper we study the cosmology induced in a concrete string theoretic construction @xcite in which an s - brane mediates the transition between the contracting and expanding phases . in these models ,",
    "the s - brane is _ not _ located on a hypersurface of constant energy density .",
    "instead , it sits on a hypersurface of constant critical string - frame temperature @xmath3 at which point a marginal operator on the worldsheet becomes relevant and induces direct transitions between thermal winding and thermal momentum states , thus interpolating between two different geometric phases of the underlying worldsheet cft .",
    "in the einstein frame the hypersurface is _ not _ isothermal since the temperature @xmath4 is dressed by the dilaton field : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the string coupling .",
    "this yields to a new kind of hypersurface where the combination @xmath7 has a maximal and constant value @xmath8 . as we will shall see further , the precise properties of this isothermal hypersurface yield an unsuppressed mixing between the spectrum of fluctuations of the growing mode of @xmath1 in the contracting phase with that of the constant mode of @xmath1 in the expanding phase , which translates at late times into a scale invariant spectrum for the curvature perturbation @xmath9 .",
    "the role of the s - brane is to glue the geometrical phases associated with the two dual asymptotically cold regimes in a consistent way in the low energy effective theory , and as such , provides the means to _ instantaneously _ violate the nec @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous nature of this violation simply does not permit the time for any gradient instabilities to set in  the microphysical realization of the s - brane as a space - filling defect that mediates the phase transition between distinct geometric phases of the explicit underlying string construction guaranteeing its consistency @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we begin by reviewing the background string construction and its low energy description at length , after which we consider perturbations of the system in longitudinal gauge ( see appendix [ adm4 ] for a discussion of other gauge choices ) .",
    "we then consider matching the perturbations across the s - brane , demonstrating that there is no thermal entropy production by the fluctuations of the s - brane .",
    "we find that due to the specific properties of the stringy s - brane , no isocurvature component is generated at the bounce and a scale invariant spectrum for the curvature perturbation results at late times .",
    "after contextualizing this calculation in the matter bounce scenario , we offer a summary and our concluding thoughts , taking care to highlight the open issues confronting our model .",
    "we consider bouncing string cosmologies that are induced by specific weakly - coupled , thermal configurations of @xmath10 superstrings @xcite compactified to four dimensions .",
    "compactifications with less amount of ( initial ) supersymmetry could also be considered without changing the main conclusions concerning the evolution through the bounce . in order to study the thermodynamic properties of the system",
    ", we employ the euclidean description where the time direction is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to temperature , non - trivial `` gravito - magnetic '' fluxes thread the euclidean time circle , as well as internal spatial cycles responsible for the ( spontaneous ) breaking of the right - moving supersymmetries @xcite .",
    "effectively the fluxes suppress the exponentially growing density of thermally excited oscillator states , curing the hagedorn instabilities of the canonical ensemble and restoring the t - duality symmetry along the euclidean time direction .",
    "the one - loop string partition function is finite for all values of the thermal modulus @xmath11 , and it is invariant under thermal duality : z(r ) = z ( ) , where the self dual , critical radius @xmath12 is of order the string scale . in a large class of type",
    "ii superstring models , the critical radius attains a universal value , @xmath13 ( corresponding to the so - called fermionic point ) , irrespective of the dimensionality of spacetime .",
    "a direct consequence of thermal duality is that the stringy system exhibits two asymptotically cold regimes , at @xmath14 and at @xmath15 , dominated by the light thermal momentum and light thermal winding modes respectively .",
    "each asymptotic regime gives rise to a local low energy effective field theory description , associated with a distinct @xmath16-expansion , with the inverse temperature @xmath17 being proportional to the period of the euclidean time circle or its dual respectively : [ beta(r ) ] = 2r rr_c , = 2 r_c^2r rr_c , where the tilde denotes quantities in the string frame .",
    "( further on , untilded variables will denote einstein frame quantities . ) as a result the temperature in these models never exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath18 , which the system attains at the self - dual fermionic point .    in the regime of light thermal momenta ,",
    "@xmath19 , the partition function is dominated by the thermally excited massless states and is given by @xcite = n^ * _ r ( 2r)^3 + ( e^- r/",
    "r_c ) , where @xmath20 is the volume of our three - dimensional spatial torus , which we can take to be arbitrarily large ; @xmath21 is the number of the effectively massless degrees of freedom and @xmath22 is boltzmann s radiation constant . in the dual regime of light thermal windings ,",
    "@xmath23 , the expression for the partition function becomes = n^ * _ r r^3(2r_c^2)^3 + ( e^- r_c / r_0 ) . in terms of the duality invariant inverse temperature @xmath24 ,",
    "( [ beta(r ) ] ) , the partition function in _ both _ asymptotic regimes is given by = n^ * _ r ^3 + ( e^- / _ c ) , leading to the characteristic equation of state of massless thermal radiation .",
    "the presence of asymptotic supersymmetry in the right - moving string sector ensures that the partition function , and so the resulting equation of state , can be well approximated with that of massless thermal radiation up to temperatures close to the critical one @xcite . in the neighborhood of the self - dual point , the one - loop thermodynamical quantities acquire stringy corrections , including the precise relation between the inverse temperature and the radius of the thermal circle , but the dynamics in the intermediate regime is dominated by genus zero condensates that can materialize at the critical point .    around the critical point @xmath25 , additional thermal states characterized by both non - trivial winding and",
    "momentum charges and masses m^2=14r_c^2(r_c r - r r_c)^2 , become light , giving rise to an enhanced @xmath26 gauge symmetry .",
    "thus the intermediate regime admits a well - defined description in terms of an @xmath27_{k=2}$ ] worldsheet cft , and the effective thermal theory at the critical point is in terms of an @xmath28 gauge theory with massless scalar fields in the adjoint representation .",
    "each asymptotic thermal phase arises as a spontaneously broken symmetry phase as we deform away from the fermionic extended symmetry point .",
    "depending on the number of non - compact directions , the extra massless thermal states induce a conical structure in the one - loop partition function or for one of its derivatives as a function of @xmath11  with three non - compact spatial directions the partition function is smooth but the fourth derivative of @xmath29 is discontinuous ( as a function of @xmath11 )  indicating a non - trivial phase transition between the two asymptotically cold regimes as the temperature varies .",
    "it turns out that the stringy transition at @xmath12 can be resolved in the presence of genus-0 condensates associated with the extra massless states , which mediate transitions between purely thermal winding and purely thermal momentum states . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the equations of motion at the critical point allow such condensates to be realized via non - zero spatial gradients of the corresponding extra massless thermal fields , leading to additional negative pressure contributions in the low energy effective action . in the lorentzian description , where the temperature becomes time dependent",
    ", these contributions can give rise to a spacelike brane ( s - brane ) configuration , materializing along a time slice at which the temperature reaches its critical value @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the brane has finite but string - scale thickness in time , and hence in the low energy effective description , we can treat it as a @xmath30-function source ( since resolving it would require probes with energies that approach the cut - off of the effective theory ) . since the brane is spacelike , its associated energy density will vanish , but it will have negative pressure in the spatial dimensions . away from the @xmath30-function source ,",
    "the effective action is that of the usual low energy degrees of freedom of string theory i.e. of dilaton - gravity coupled to a thermal gas of pressure @xmath31 and energy density @xmath32 .",

    "one possibility is a solution in which the underlying thermal modulus @xmath11 runs from @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly the ( string frame ) temperature grows from small values , reaching its maximal value , @xmath8 , and then drops again to zero . at sub - critical values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the universe is in a contracting phase , while for @xmath35 the universe is expanding . at the critical value of @xmath11",
    ", the s - brane configuration provides the violation of the nec which induces a transition from contraction to expansion ( when the cosmology is viewed in the einstein frame ) .",
    "the dilaton grows in the contracting phase and undergoes an elastic bounce across the brane . in the expanding phase ,",
    "it decreases and asymptotes to a constant value in the future .",
    "hence the dilaton attains its maximal value at the transition point , as set by the brane tension @xcite .",
    "if this critical value of the dilaton is sufficiently small the perturbative analysis can be justified .",
    "therefore , within the setup of @xcite , a bouncing cosmology connecting two asymptotically cold phases results .    in @xcite another class of non - singular string cosmologies was obtained .",
    "by utilizing various fluxes in the effective gauged supergravity description at the extended symmetry point , an  emergent \" phase with constant string frame temperature @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath25 , and constant string frame scale factor @xmath37 , but with growing dilaton can be supported .",
    "the string coupling is very weak in the far past , and so this brany phase can last for a long period of time .",
    "the regime terminates when the gauge condensates decay once the dilaton has reached a sufficiently large value , with the universe entering in the phase @xmath35 described above .",
    "the transition surface can be again described by an s - brane configuration . in the einstein frame",
    ", the emergent phase describes a contracting universe with increasing temperature . in this paper",
    "however , we will focus on the analysis of the cosmological fluctuations in the first cosmological scenario described above , deferring the analysis for the second interesting possibility for future work .",
    "we take note of the fact that the violation of the nec responsible for the bounce follows from the existence of the s - brane sources localized in time , associated to non - trivial spatial gradients for the extra massless thermal scalars @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of the precise equation of state of the thermal system in the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "therefore , in order to be quantitative in what follows , we shall approximate the thermal system with that of massless thermal radiation up to the critical point .",
    "since we are at weak string coupling and since the size of the spatial torus is much larger than the string scale , it is possible to derive an effective action for the cosmological dynamics which is valid both in the asymptotic radiation eras and also close to the critical temperature . in the string frame and in the thin s - brane approximation",

    "the string bouncing cosmology can be connected to early and late epochs of matter domination , thus providing a non - singular realization of the matter bounce scenario .",

    "once the temperature has dropped just below the dilaton mass , @xmath259tev , the dilaton starts to roll towards its minimum , radiating its kinetic energy , eventually undergoing damped oscillations so that it rapidly freezes at its minimum .",
    "thus the matter dominated era is preceeded by a radiation era where the dilaton is frozen .",
    "note that the long wavelength fluctuations in this intermediate , radiation dominated phase are by default adiabatic since the dilaton is fixed and a single fluid dominates the evolution .    by thermal duality symmetry , the cosmological regimes encountered in the expanding phase should appear also in the contacting phase but in reverse chronological order .",
    "hence we begin with a large and asymptotically cold contracting phase where supersymmetry is broken , massive fields dominate the background and the dilaton is fixed .",
    "this is the initial matter - dominated phase of contraction . in this phase",
    "an almost pressureless hydrodynamical fluid dominates the background and sources fluctuations .",
    "we denote its energy density by @xmath263 and its pressure by @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is very small .",
    "there is also a subdominant radiation fluid component ( with equation of state @xmath126 ) which becomes relevant at around the time of equal matter and radiation denoted by @xmath266 .",
    "the dilaton remains frozen at its minimum until the universe has heated to the temperature corresponding to the supersymmetry breaking scale or the dilaton mass , whichever is earlier .",
    "the dilaton then becomes effectively massless and thus dynamical and the description of the fluids given in the earlier sections become applicable : the radiation dominated phase being admixed with the dynamical dilaton whose dynamics become more and more relevant as the s - brane bounce is approached . taking the asymptotic value of the background dilaton field early on in the thermal string gas / dilaton phase to be given by the value of the dilaton at its minimum imposes that the coefficient @xmath207 vanishes , which in turn implies the relation c_3=0",
    "c_=3c _ , with @xmath114 and @xmath113 defined by eqs ( [ solsig ] ) and ( [ solpp ] ) .",

    "for example , a `` baryon''-matter / radiation plasma , where the matter fluid and the radiation component do not decouple , gives rise to a situation where the coefficient @xmath265 is slowly varying and becomes very small in the matter dominated phase . ] .",
    "the speed of sound , given by @xmath268 is correspondingly also small .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ a ] , a convenient way to describe the various states of the fluid matter is via a derivatively coupled scalar field @xmath269 , in terms of which the pressure is written as follows : p = x^1+w 2w=(-12__m^_m)^1+w 2w .",

    "in terms of these we introduce the gauge invariant , canonical variable v= a(_m+(_m^)_0h ) , whose modes satisfy the following equation of motion : v_k^ + ^2(k ) v_k=0 , ^2(k)=c_s^2k^2- a^a . utilizing the expression for the background scale factor @xmath68",

    "this oscillatory behavior at short wavelengths occurs independently of the equation of state coefficient @xmath265 .",
    "it also arises in situations where the speed of sound is slowly varying with time , via the wkb approximation @xcite . at short wavelengths",
    "the spectra of these two @xmath275-modes behave like that of vacuum fluctuations , which is blue .    at long wavelengths on the other hand , @xmath276 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the bessel functions leads to a power law behavior v_k~. vacuum initial conditions for @xmath277  that is , @xmath278 are @xmath2-independent constants  imply that the mode proportional to @xmath273 gives rise to an almost scale invariant spectrum when @xmath279 with @xmath265 small enough , while the @xmath272 mode gives rise to a blue spectrum which is irrelevant on super - hubble scales .    physically , this result can be understood as follows .",
    "the @xmath273 mode increases on super - hubble scales . since",
    "long wavelengths spend more time outside the hubble radius , small @xmath2 modes are boosted relative to large @xmath2 modes , i.e. the spectrum reddens .",
    "what is particular about a matter - dominated phase of contraction is that the growing @xmath273 mode scales as @xmath280 , which is precisely the growth rate needed to convert the initially blue vacuum spectrum to a scale - invariant one .",
    "thus , at the end of the matter - dominated phase of contraction we have [ scav ] v_k ~-b_- ( 32 - 6w )  ||^-1 + 6w ( k2)^-32 + 6w , yielding a power spectrum p_v(k , || ) =    independent of @xmath2 up to small logarithmic corrections .",

    "at early negative times , @xmath294 , when the matter fluid dominates , the speed of sound tends to zero , while at times @xmath295 , it acquires the constant value of @xmath296 .    in order to relate the parameters of the initial matter dominated regime with the parameters of the matter / radiation plasma era , it is convenient to work with the gauge invariant quantity @xmath9 . in terms of the variable @xmath282",

    "the @xmath297-corrections turn out to be key for our considerations .",
    "indeed neglecting them , one would obtain ^0=- c_+ , without any dependence on the relevant @xmath298 mode of the matter dominated regime .",
    "even worse , the @xmath299 mode is irrelevant on super hubble scales as it gives rise to an ultra blue spectrum .",
    "therefore , the relevant contributions to @xmath9 arise from the @xmath297-terms , and more specifically from terms proportional to the @xmath298 mode . neglecting the irrelevant blue modes ,",

    "the smallness of @xmath304 in the matter dominated regime imposes that @xmath300 .",
    "the upper limit is conveniently chosen to lie in the radiation dominated regime , and provides the initial condition for the curvature perturbation for the subsequent cosmological evolution .    as already demonstrated in section [ zeta ] , upon taking into account that the coefficient @xmath207 must vanish , from the onset of the radiation regime and during the subsequent cosmological evolution ,",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath9 remains constant and is equal to the fundamental parameter @xmath305 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath207 is zero since the dilaton is frozen to its minimum during the radiation dominated era , before the thermal string gas / dilaton fluid dominance .",
    "these considerations impose that @xmath306 .",
    "the scaling of the coefficient @xmath298 with the wavenumber @xmath2 was determined in the initial matter dominated regime and turns out to scale like @xmath291 .",
    "this is the precise scaling needed to render the power spectrum of @xmath307 , and hence the spectrum of @xmath113 , scale invariant .",
    "indeed , the curvature perturbation at the onset of the radiation era is given by -c_(k)=_k(_r ) = c _ k^-3 2 , where the coefficient @xmath308 is @xmath2-independent , showing that the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath113 is scale invariant : p_c _ =    growing mode in the initial matter dominated contracting phase is inherited by the constant mode of the curvature fluctuation through the subsequent cosmological evolution and is preserved after the s - brane mediated bounce on to the expanding phase .",

    "we conclude this section with some remarks concerning the other class of string models exhibiting spontaneous breaking of susy , namely models where the dilaton participates in the susy breaking mechanism , and thus acquires a very small mass : @xmath311ev . in this case",
    "the dilaton becomes effectively massless during the initial matter dominated phase of contraction , and thus dynamical thereafter , giving rise to a non - zero coefficient @xmath207 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) , for this case the long wavelength perturbation @xmath9 is not conserved during the thermal string gas / dilaton phase , implying the presence of non - adiabatic , isocurvature modes .",
    "the contribution of these modes acquires its maximal value at the s - brane , but it is negligible at lower temperatures , as it is suppressed by a factor of @xmath242 .",
    "there is however a very interesting , non - trivial effect in that the dilaton admixture to the matter fluid causes the effective speed of sound to change , giving rise to a tilt in the spectral index of curvature fluctuations .",
    "qualitatively , this tilt , which depends on the dilaton mass @xmath312 , will appear as a violation of exact scale invariance for the spectrum .",
    "the existence of such a tilt is supported by recent observational data .",
    "the complete analysis of this case is rather involved , as it requires to investigate the cosmological fluctuations in a three fluid system , however it would be very interesting to carry it out in order to compare the predictions of the model for spectral index with the observational data .",
    "we plan to quantitatively analyze such string models in future work .",
    "we have studied the transfer of cosmological fluctuations through a stringy s - brane , which mediates the transition between contracting and expanding cosmological phases related via string thermal duality symmetry .",
    "the s - brane itself is a space - filling defect that interpolates between the two dual geometrical phases of the underlying worldsheet cft , and is sourced by non - trivial thermal string states that become massless at a critical maximal temperature .",
    "as we demonstrated in this paper , the energy density of the spacelike brane vanishes , _ even in the presence of metric and dilaton fluctuations _ , while the pressure along the spatial dimensions is negative .",
    "therefore , the brane provides the violation of the nec needed to induce a transition from contraction to expansion ( in the einstein frame ) .",
    "since the s - brane has a string scale thickness in time , it is realized instantaneously from the perspective of the low energy effective theory .",
    "the resulting spacelike hypersurface is distinct , and has not been considered previously in the literature .",
    "it is defined as a surface of constant string frame temperature , with the latter reaching its maximal value as imposed by the thermal duality symmetry of the underlying string theoretic model . from the einstein frame point of view",
    ", the s - brane surface is not isothermal since the physical temperature is dressed by a non - trivial dilaton factor .",
    "it does not correspond to a surface of constant energy density either .",
    "these properties turn out to be crucial for the matching of cosmological fluctuations across the bounce .",
    "two of our key results is that there is no thermal entropy production during the stringy transition , and that the dilaton field , including its fluctuation , is mirror reflective across the brane .",
    "working in longitudinal gauge , we followed the evolution of the gravitational potential @xmath1 and that of the dilaton fluctuation @xmath125 .",
    "a crucial property of the underlying string cosmological background solutions is that the einstein frame hubble parameter @xmath313 does not vanish at the bounce ( where the s - brane materializes ) .",
    "this is because the dilaton field has a non - trivial kinetic energy density which is conserved as the dilaton bounces elastically across the brane .",
    "this is another distinguishing feature of the string cosmological solutions under consideration compared to other models in the literature . in each cosmological phase",
    "there are two independent modes for the gravitational potential @xmath1 and for the dilaton fluctuation @xmath125 . in the expanding phase ,",
    "the dominant modes of both @xmath1 and @xmath125 at super - hubble scales are constant , while the sub - dominant modes are decaying in time . in the contracting phase",
    "there are in addition to constant long wavelength modes , growing modes that become relevant as the s - brane is approached . due to the underlying thermal duality symmetry ,",
    "the constraint of a maximal string frame temperature and the conservation of thermal entropy , the growing modes never become dominant .",
    "their amplitudes are bounded never exceeding those of the constant modes .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation arising in other pre - big bang proposals .",
    "one of our main results is that both the constant modes and growing modes participate in the junction conditions across the s - brane hypersurface .",
    "the fact that the string frame temperature attains its maximal value at the bounce is crucial in implementing the junction conditions consistently .",
    "we show that the junction conditions are compatible with the israel matching conditions in the einstein frame .",
    "a very important consequence of our analysis is that there is a non - trivial coupling between growing modes in the contracting phase and the constant mode in the expanding phase that controls the strength of the late times curvature fluctuation .",
    "this contrasts to what is obtained in toy models of non - singular bounces @xcite where one finds highly suppressed couplings .",
    "the important lesson we draw from our work is thus that the details of how the transition between the contracting and expanding phases is achieved is key to understanding how the cosmological fluctuations propagate from one phase to the other .",
    "this sensitivity to the details of the mechanism which produces the bounce is not unexpected since it was already identified in different contexts in @xcite .    having in our disposal a non singular",
    ", bouncing string cosmology as well as having correctly matched the cosmological fluctuations across the s - brane , we proceeded to consider the realization of the _ matter bounce _",
    "scenario within our stringy framework . to complete the cosmological evolution at very low temperatures in both the contracting and expanding phases",
    ", we needed to implement a supersymmetry breaking mechanism . to this end",
    ", we distinguish between two generic classes of models . in the first class",
    "the dilaton does not participate in the susy breaking mechanism , receiving a relatively high mass of the order of the susy breaking scale @xmath314 . in the second class",
    ", the dilaton is assumed to participate in the susy breaking mechanism thus acquiring a characteristic mass of order @xmath315 . as a result",
    "prior to the contracting thermal string gas / dilaton phase , there is an earlier phase in which supersymmetry is broken . in the cases where the dilaton acquires a relatively high mass , the dilaton is frozen and masses",
    "are generated , yielding an initial matter - dominated contracting phase with a subdominant radiation component that becomes relevant at a time of equal matter and radiation .",
    "a consequence of dilaton stabilization with a mass of the order of @xmath314 ( and the matching conditions at the s - brane ) is that the evolution of the long wavelength perturbations during the subsequent thermal string gas / dilaton phase and on to the expanding phase through the bounce is adiabatic .    to avoid gauge ambiguities we work in terms of the mukhanov - sasaki canonical variable @xmath275 .",
    "this variable inherits a scale - invariant power spectrum in the initial matter dominated phase of contraction .",
    "we showed that this scale invariant spectrum is communicated to both modes of the gravitational potential @xmath1 in the contracting phase , at the onset of radiation dominance . on scales of cosmological interest today , which have exited the hubble radius long before the supersymmetry restoring phase transition ,",
    "the slope of the spectrum of both modes is maintained , since all modes are evolving for the same amount of time in this phase and the change in the amplitude only depends on the time interval spent in this phase .",
    "the matching conditions at the stringy s - brane then show that the scale - invariance of the dominant mode of curvature fluctuations at late times in the expanding phase is inherited from the spectrum of the two @xmath1-modes before the bounce .",
    "therefore the string bouncing cosmology considered in this work provides a successful , non - singular realization of the matter bounce scenario .",
    "another advantage of our scenario compared to other bouncing models studied in the literature is that the bounce is not mediated by ad hoc new physics constructions such as ghost condensates or higher derivative gravity actions .",
    "furthermore , in the model studied in this investigation there is no danger of new unstable modes appearing in the bounce phase .",
    "this problem , stressed recently in @xcite in the context of the  new ekpyrotic scenario \" @xcite can not arise in our setup .",
    "we take note of the potential issue of the instability of a contracting phase to the growth of anisotropies  the famous bkl instability @xcite .",
    "this is a problem faced in all bouncing models known to us with the exception of the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite and models @xcite using an ekpyrotic phase of contraction to supplement the matter bounce scenario .",
    "the reason the latter models evade the bkl instability is that the field responsible for the contracting phase has an energy density which blueshifts faster than the anisotropic contributions to the energy density ( which blueshift as @xmath316 ) , and so negates the influence of the latter . in our model ,",
    "we find ourselves in a marginal situation , wherein the dilaton kinetic energy blueshifts identically to the contributions to the energy density from anisotropy .",
    "thus in addition , we have to assume that we have initial conditions such that the initial energy density of the dilaton as we begin the radiation dominated contraction dominates that of any initial anisotropies .",
    "even though we did not carry out a quantitative analysis for the cases with a very light dilaton mass , we argued that the dilaton motion during the initial matter dominated phase of contraction will produce a small violation to exact scale - invariance for the spectrum of curvature fluctuations , or a tilt to the spectral index .",
    "a second effect is the generation of initial `` entropy '' modes .",
    "one could worry that these modes could dominate the spectrum of the final curvature fluctuations ( in the context of inflationary cosmology this is the _ curvaton _ mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "however as we have seen in our work , the analysis of such modes in the long wavelength approximation during the thermal string gas / dilaton expanding phase reveals that at latter times their contribution to the curvature fluctuation is highly suppressed by a factor of @xmath242 .",
    "the issue of obtaining a realistic spectrum that is not scale invariant is an interesting one . given the current cmb data from the south pole telescope @xcite , the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite and the planck mission @xcite , a small red tilt is strongly favored .",
    "therefore it is imperative to carry out the complete analysis of the light dilaton cases in order to investigate whether its predictions can explain the observational data .",
    "however we believe the correct perspective to have of the positive result of our investigation is that of a proof of concept . with this , one could be emboldened to look for concrete constructions that can more realistically model the late time universe in which we find ourselves .",
