    "<S> in the @xmath0-carbide - type correlated - electron metal fe@xmath1mo@xmath1n , ferromagnetism is abruptly induced from a nonmagnetic non - fermi - liquid ground state either when a magnetic field ( @xmath214 t ) applied to it or when it is doped with a slight amount of impurity ( @xmath25% co ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a peak in the paramagnetic neutron scattering intensity at finite wave vectors , revealing the presence of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlation hidden in the magnetic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it causes a new type of geometrical frustration in the _ stellla quadrangula _ lattice of the fe sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the frustrated af correlation suppresses the f correlation to its marginal point and is therfore responsible for the origin of the ferromagnetic ( f ) quantum critical behavior in pure fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n .    </S>",
    "<S> the geometric frustration in electronic degrees of freedom is a key factor responsible for the suppression of long - range magnetic order that may lead to the realization of new and exotic quantum phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the role of frustration was established in localized electron systems , no consensus has been achieved as far as their role in itinerant electron metals is concerned @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons for this is the fact that a limited number of materials of this type are available . </S>",
    "<S> y(sc)mn@xmath4 , @xmath5-mn , liv@xmath4o@xmath6 , etc .  are some of the known examples @xcite , whose electronic quasiparticle mass is commonly enhanced but the manner in which it is enhanced is still under debate . to resolve this issue , it is essential that we find other materials of a similar nature . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose the @xmath0-carbide - type transition metal compound as a good candidate for testing geometric frustration in metallic magnets ; the @xmath0-carbide - type structure ( prototype : fe@xmath3w@xmath3c , space group : @xmath7 ) includes the _ stella quadrangula _ ( sq ) lattice ( wyckoff positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xcite , which is a corner - shared network of stellate ( tetra - capped ) tetrahedrons ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . in an sq as a unit , </S>",
    "<S> a small regular tetrahedron at @xmath9 is nested in each @xmath8 tetrahedron having the same center of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , direct coupling is expected at the relatively short fe - fe bonds . even though @xmath0-carbide - type transition - metal compounds have been known for a long time as impurities in steel and refractory and hard materials , as well as promising candidates for catalysts , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , their quantum physical properties have been less studied thus far . </S>",
    "<S> ( as an exception , see @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we have recently reported that fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n with the @xmath0-carbide - type structure @xcite exhibits a non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior near the ferromagnetic ( f ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) under ambient pressure @xcite , which is different from the findings of literatures published previously @xcite ; @xmath10 ( @xmath11 :  specific heat , @xmath12 :  temperature ) shows a -@xmath13 divergence and reaches 128 mj/(f.u.mol k@xmath14 ) at 0.5 k , and the resistivity shows a @xmath15 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n is a one of the ideal fe - based materials exhibiting nfl behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility @xmath16 of fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n obeys the curie - weiss ( cw ) law at high @xmath12 ( effective moment @xmath17 @xmath18/fe , weiss temperature @xmath19 k ) and exhibits a broad maximum at @xmath275 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath20 maximum is commonly observed among exchange - enhanced pauli paramagnetic metals undergoing itinerant - electron metamagnetism ( iem ) @xcite , the application of a high magnetic field to fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n may yield interesting results . </S>",
    "<S> iem of fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n is also fascinating related with the recent interest in the phase diagram in the visinity of f - qcp and tuning of quantum criticality @xcite . while we have detected the iem at @xmath214 t , it is somewhat different from a typical iem @xcite . in order to determine the reason for this difference , impurity doping ( co for fe ) and inelastic neutron scattering measurements of fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n were performed . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the characteristics of the sq lattice as a new geometrically frustrated system , and we use this model to explain the absence of long - range order in pure fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n in spite of the strong electron correlation .    </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline samples of ( fe@xmath21co@xmath22)@xmath1mo@xmath1n , where @xmath23 , were synthesized by a solid - state reaction of a mixture of transition metal oxides in a h@xmath4-n@xmath4 mixed gas stream @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fe@xmath4o@xmath1 , co@xmath1o@xmath6 , and moo@xmath1 were mixed in a molar ratio of @xmath24 and placed in a silica tube ; and the mixture was then fired in a gas stream of n@xmath4 containing 10% h@xmath4 at 700@xmath25c for 48 h followed by heat treatment at 1000@xmath25c for 48 h. in order to homogenize the samples , the heat treatment , interspersed with intermediate grinding , was repeated at least four times , resulting in a systematic variation in the magnetism against @xmath26 , which is not in accordance with the literature data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization @xmath27 at low fields was measured using a squid magnetometer , mpms ( quantum design ) equipped in the ltm center , kyoto university . </S>",
    "<S> the high - field magnetization for field strengths up to 54 t was measured for pure fe@xmath1mo@xmath1n using a pulse magnet equipped in issp at 4.2100 k. polycrystalline powder was filled into a cylindrical polyethylene tube that measured 6 mm in length and 2.5 mm in diameter . for the neutron scattering experiments , </S>",
    "<S> approximately 20 g of the powder was packed into a vanadium tube with a diameter of 20 mm . </S>",
    "<S> a triple - axis spectrometer issp - her installed at the c1 - 1 cold neutron guide of the research reactor jrr-3 m at japan atomic energy agency ( jaea ) , tokai , was employed . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were performed at a fixed final wave vector @xmath28 @xmath29 , with a collimation sequence of guide-@xmath30-open - open , and with a horizontal focusing analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution was estimated to be 0.22 mev at zero energy transfer .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows the results of the high - field magnetization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the signal from the pulse magnet corresponding to @xmath31 ( at 4.2 k ) is plotted against the external magnetic field @xmath32 in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 shows diverging behavior at @xmath214 t , corresponding to a sharp jump in the @xmath27-@xmath32 curve , which was obtained by integrating @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the metamagnetic fields @xmath33 are different for the field - increasing and decreasing processes because of the first - order transition , although the difference ( hysteresis width ) @xmath34 is much smaller ( 0.56 t at 4.2 k ) than that for a typical iem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 decreases with @xmath12 and vanishes at @xmath35 k ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ) , which is the temperature at which the first - order iem disappears , and corresponds to the substantial magnetic interaction in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in @xmath33 is roughly proportional to @xmath36 up to @xmath37 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) closed circles ) , as commonly observed in iem @xcite . in the field - increasing process </S>",
    "<S> , a small step was observed at a field ( defined as @xmath38 ) slightly grater than @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 decreases gradually with @xmath12 and disappears at @xmath220 k ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) open circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization jump is sharp unlike that observed in other iems @xcite and rather similar to that of a spin flip in a localized spin system . </S>",
    "<S> successive magnetic transitions in the magnetic field are frequently observed in local spin systems ; however , they are unlikely to be a part of a conventional iem with uniform spin polarization , thus suggesting the presence of competing interactions or multiple order parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of impurity doping was investigated by replacing co with fe . </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully synthesized a solid solution between fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n and the pauli paramagnetic co@xmath3mo@xmath3n ; the lattice parameter was found to vary linearly with the co fraction @xmath26 ( vegard s law ) in accordance with the literature data @xcite . as a typical example , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic data of ( fe@xmath39co@xmath40)@xmath3mo@xmath3n are presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) . at high @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 follows the cw law well ( @xmath41 @xmath42/fe , @xmath43 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arrott plot ( @xmath44 against @xmath45 plot ) shows good linearity and intersects the vertical axis below 22 k , indicating the occurence of spontaneous magnetization @xmath46 ( = @xmath47 at 5 k ) below the curie temperature @xmath48 k , despite the fact that both end compounds have nonmagnetic ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath49 is much larger than unity , as is characteristic of a typical weak itinerant electron ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> similar analyses were carried out for other specimens to enable the construction of the magnetic phase diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ( detailed magnetic data will be published elsewhere ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of this phase diagram are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> a ferromagnetic phase appears by slight doping ( @xmath50 ) . with an increase in @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath51 increases rapidly up to a maximum at @xmath52 and decreases almost linearly after the maximum up to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the @xmath37 of pure fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n is much higher than the maximum value of @xmath51 and is smoothly connected to the variation in @xmath51 for @xmath54 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , long - range ferromagnetism appears to be suppressed particularly at @xmath55 , in spite of strong magnetic correlation .    to obtain information on the magnetic interactions in fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n , </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed with the powder ; unfortunately , single crystals have not been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4 ] shows the wave number ( @xmath56 ) dependences of quasi - elastic neutron scattering measured at 5.5 k. relatively strong scattering was observed , centered at finite but relatively small @xmath56 , which roughly corresponds to the mean distances between fe atoms , suggesting the presence of af spin correlation together with the f correlation that was detected from macroscopic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57-scan spectra , shown in the inset , were fitted with a lorentzian quasi - elastic scattering function . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral widths , i.e. , characteristic energies of spin fluctuations , are obtained as 0.4 , 0.3 and 0.9 mev for @xmath58 , 1.78 , and 2.83 in the reciprocal lattice unit , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us understand the geometrical characteristics of the sq lattice on the basis of the heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> although fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n appears to behave like an itinerant electron magnet , we believe that its spin density is relatively localized at the atomic site , as deduced from the strong electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the sq lattice consists of @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites arranged in the @xmath7 space group . in actual @xmath0-carbide - type compounds , the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) distances are close and </S>",
    "<S> become exactly the same when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the coordinate of the @xmath9 site @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , @xmath62 @xcite and similar values @xcite have been reported for fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n , where the nn @xmath8-@xmath9 distance is 2.387   and nnn </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9-@xmath9 distance is 2.549   at room temperature . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider only these nn and nnn interactions , namely , @xmath63 and @xmath64 interactions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) , respectively , and neglect the interactions of the neighbours located further along . </S>",
    "<S> the signs of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are likely to vary because , empirically , both the f and the af states appear in doped fe - based @xmath0-carbide - type compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , let us understand the nature of an isolated sq . </S>",
    "<S> in an extreme case , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the sq is not frustrated because the af spins can be alternately assigned to the eight atoms . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , the same is the case for @xmath67 and @xmath66 . on the other hand , when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the isolated @xmath9 tetrahedron is a typical frustrated unit . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that the sq is frustrated only when @xmath64 is negative and dominant . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this is true not only when @xmath65 but also when @xmath70 . to verify whether this is true for an infinite sq lattice , we calculated the dispersions of the fourier transform of the exchange integral matrix @xmath71 among 12 fe atoms in a unit cell by assuming various @xmath72 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> two typical results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ jq ] . </S>",
    "<S> a flat dispersion is found along the highest branch when @xmath63 is not dominant ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ jq](a ) ) , suggesting the degeneracies of the ground state , i.e. , the presence of geometric frustration @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath71 takes a maximum at the @xmath73 point , where the magnitude of @xmath63 is sufficiently larger than that of @xmath64 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ jq](b ) ) , indicating that @xmath63 tends to release the frustration . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed that similar dispersions were obtained independent of the sign of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sq lattice is a unique frustrated system in which frustration is controlled by the @xmath74 ratio but not affected by the sign of @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetism of fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n can be easily understood on the basis of these characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results indicate the coexistence of the f and the af interactions , which are formally denoted as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , as one of the simplest possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of long - range order in pure fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n is due to the frustration in the sq lattice ( @xmath64 dominant case ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the frustrated af interaction suppresses the f correlation to its marginal point . </S>",
    "<S> metamagnetism can be interpreted as the transition to the @xmath63 dominant state , assisted by the external field . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of static magnetism by slight doping is one of common features of a frustrated system . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising that the f order is stabilized when the f interaction coexists with the af interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we have tentatively calculated the spin correlation function @xmath75 for the sq lattice , assuming ( 1 ) @xmath70 and dominant @xmath76 , ( 2 ) 2 up and 2 down spins in the @xmath9 tetrahedron , ( 3 ) an up spin at a @xmath8 site when the neighboring @xmath9 spins are 2 up and 1 down , and vice versa , ( 4 ) no correlation between different sqs , and ( 5 ) the magnetic form factor of fe@xmath77 . some of these assumptions may not be valid for the actual case , but have been made for the sake of simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 thus calculated and , furthermore , averaged over equal @xmath56 is illustrated by the solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath75 should ideally be compared with the @xmath57 averaged values , there is reasonable agreement between the experimental results and the calculations carried out using our model , indicating that our model is consistent with the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> although we have applied the localized moment scheme here , we have to reconcile the heisenberg frustration and the electron itinerancy in further studies .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we found a steep metamagnetic transition in the @xmath0-carbide - type fe - based compound fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n from the nonmagnetic nfl near f - qcp to a field - induced f state , and we established a magnetic phase diagram of the ( fe@xmath21co@xmath22)@xmath1mo@xmath1n system , where the f order is stabilized by a slight doping of the nonmagnetic element . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering measurements suggested that the af and the f correlations coexist in fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed that the sq lattice is a new geometrically frustrated system , in which the f and the af interactions compete to select frustrated and non - frustrated states . </S>",
    "<S> we applied this model to explain the suppression of long - range order in pure fe@xmath3mo@xmath3n . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the emergence of the f - qcp is interpreted as being the result of frustration . </S>",
    "<S> although a number of @xmath0-carbide - type transition - metal compounds are known to exist , their quantum physical properties have been less studied . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these compounds are good candidates for testing geometric frustration in metallic magnets and searching for new and exotic quantum phenomena . </S>"
