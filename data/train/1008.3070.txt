    "an appealing hint in favour of supersymmetry ( susy ) is the apparent unification of gauge couplings at a scale of about @xmath0  gev  @xcite . in particular , the gauge coupling unification is predicted , even under the assumption of a minimal particle content of the underlying grand unified theory ( gut ) , the so - called minimal susy su(5 ) model  @xcite",
    ". an important feature of this model is that the requirement of minimality renders it the most predictive model from the currently known candidates for guts .",
    "however , immediately after the formulation of the minimal susy su(5 ) it has been noticed that within susy guts new dimension - five operators cause a rapid proton decay  @xcite .",
    "this aspect was intensively studied over the last thirty years with the extreme conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite that the minimal susy su(5 ) model is ruled out by the combined constraints from proton decay and gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , in the following years several careful analyses have shown that the constraint on the coloured higgs triplet mass from proton decay was actually too strong , and that minimal susy su(5 ) is still a perfectly viable theory .",
    "the proton decay rate for the dominant channel @xmath1 can be suppressed either by sfermion mixing  @xcite or by taking into account higher dimensional operators induced at the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "such operators can also lead to a successful down quark and charged lepton yukawa coupling unification for the first two families , which is not possible in the renormalizable version of the minimal susy su(5 ) .",
    "planck - scale - induced operators also change the boundary conditions for the gauge couplings at the gut scale , since in their presence the colour octet and the isospin triplet higgs bosons contained in the @xmath2 representation do not necessarily have the same mass anymore , as it is the case in the minimal model .",
    "this fact allows for significantly weaker constraints from gauge coupling unification on the colour triplet higgs boson than in the renormalizable model .",
    "recently , new experimental data for the relevant input parameters  @xcite and substantial progress on the theory side  @xcite became available .",
    "this encourages us to reanalyze minimal susy su(5 ) focusing on the aspect of gauge coupling unification .",
    "we emphasize that in our analysis we restrict ourselves to the renormalizable version of minimal susy su(5 ) although in this way the unification of the first and second generation yukawa couplings can not be achieved . in our analysis",
    "we ignore this fact since it is not relevant here .",
    "the constraints on the mass of the coloured higgs triplet that are derived can easily be translated to the non - renormalizable version of minimal susy su(5 ) by comparison of , e.g. , eqs .",

    "@xcite and eq .",
    "( [ eq::gutrel ] ) in our paper . in this sense ,",
    "our results represent the `` worst case scenario '' .    more precisely , we review in this paper the constraints on the mass of the coloured higgs triplet @xmath3 and the grand unification scale for the exact definition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath4 within minimal susy su(5 )  @xcite taking into account the latest experimental data for the weak scale parameters and the most precise theoretical predictions currently available .",
    "we adopt the renormalization group method in the `` bottom - up '' approach to predict the values of the two parameters and take into account threshold corrections generated by the superpartners of the sm particles as well as those due to the super - heavy susy - gut particles . in this way , we can derive the two susy - gut parameters from the knowledge of the gauge coupling constants of the sm at the electroweak scale and the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) mass spectrum .",
    "in addition , we implement the perturbativity restrictions for all gauge , yukawa and higgs self couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ , we require that they are smaller than one up to the planck scale .    besides the minimal su(5 ) we also briefly discuss the phenomenological consequences of the missing doublet model ( mdm ) which has been designed in order to avoid unnatural doublet - triplet splitting in the higgs fields of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 representations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce our framework and describe the tools we have used for our analysis . in particular",
    "we specify the underlying gut theory and describe in detail our procedure for the running and decoupling . in section  [ sec::pheno ]",
    "the phenomenological consequences are discussed where we study in particular the constraints on the gut masses of minimal susy su(5 ) .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec::concl ] .",
    "in section  [ sec::pheno ] we discuss in detail the restrictions on `` minimal su(5 ) '' , however , mention also briefly the consequences for the so - called `` missing doublet model '' . for convenience of the reader",
    "we introduce in this subsection some details on these models .",
    "the superpotential of minimal su(5 ) @xcite is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is a generation index ) are matter multiplets in the @xmath11- and @xmath12-dimensional representation of su(5 ) , respectively , and the field @xmath13",
    "( @xmath14 ) is realized in the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) representation .",
    "su(5 ) is broken to su(3)@xmath15su(2)@xmath15u(1 ) if the adjoint higgs boson @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) gets the vacuum expectation value @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "choosing @xmath20 and in addition imposing the ( tree - level-)fine - tuning condition @xmath21 the isodoublets in @xmath13 and @xmath14 remain massless .",
    "furthermore , one gets the following super - heavy mass spectrum : @xmath22 where the indices in round brackets refer to the su(3 ) and su(2 ) quantum numbers . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes the mass of the colour octet part of the adjoint higgs boson @xmath24 and @xmath25 stands for the mass of the colour triplets of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath26 is the mass of the gauge bosons and @xmath27 is the gauge coupling .",
    "the equality @xmath28 only holds if one neglects operators that are suppressed by @xmath29 as we do here .",
    "we emphasize again that taking into account such operators can considerably weaken the constraint on the colour triplet mass @xmath25 that is derived later in this paper  @xcite .",
    "however , the altered constraint can easily be derived from our results .",
    "the effects of the super - heavy particle masses on the mssm gauge couplings can be parametrized with the help of decoupling coefficients .",
    "if we interpret the mssm as the low - energy effective theory of the susy su(5 ) model , we can define its three gauge coupling constants as functions of the unique su(5 ) gauge coupling @xmath30 through @xmath31 where @xmath32 denote the decoupling coefficients that can be obtained from green s functions with external light particles computed in the full and effective theory .",
    "the scale @xmath33 is an unphysical parameter , not fixed by theory .",
    "the dependence of physical observables on @xmath33 thus provides an estimation of the theoretical uncertainties within fixed order perturbation theory .    for susy theories",
    "the most convenient regularization scheme is dimensional reduction ( dred)@xcite which we also adopt in our calculation . as a consequence , the coupling constants appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq::dec ] ) are renormalized minimally in the so - called @xmath34 renormalization scheme .",
    "the one - loop formulas of the decoupling coefficients for a general gauge group have been known for a long time  @xcite .",

    "the missing doublet model  @xcite is designed to avoid unnatural doublet - triplet splitting in the field @xmath13 that is present in the minimal model .",
    "this is achieved at the cost of introducing additional higgs fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the large su(5 ) representations @xmath40 and @xmath41 that do not contain any isodoublets and thus only couple to the colour triplets in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to break su(5 ) another higgs field @xmath24 in the @xmath42 representation",

    ", the perturbativity requirement can not be fulfilled . in this case",
    "the decoupling constants read  @xcite @xmath49 as we will see later , the presence of the large representation @xmath42 in this model leads to huge theoretical uncertainties due to the variation of the unphysical scale @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that gauge coupling unification is highly sensitive to the super - heavy mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this property allows us to probe unification through precision measurements of low - energy parameters like the gauge couplings at the electroweak scale or the supersymmetric mass spectrum .",
    "a simple algebraic exercise taking into account the naive step - function approximation  @xcite based on one - loop rges provides analytical formulas for the determination of the gut spectrum as a function of the three gauge couplings measured at the @xmath50-boson mass scale .",
    "an estimate of three - loop as compared to two - loop running has been obtained in ref .",
    "note , however , that a consistent treatment requires the implementation of @xmath51-loop rges and @xmath52-loop threshold corrections .",
    "we have adopted this approach for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , whenever the required theoretical input was available , and have solved numerically the system of differential equations .",
    "crucial input for our analysis constitute the precise values of the gauge couplings at the electroweak scale .",
    "they are obtained from the weak mixing angle in the @xmath55 scheme  @xcite , the qed coupling constant at zero momentum transfer and its hadronic  @xcite contribution in order to obtain its counterpart at the @xmath50-boson scale , and the strong coupling constant  @xcite . instead of @xmath56 .",

    "the procedure to incorporate the supersymmetric effects on the numerical value of @xmath75 is as follows : in a first step we transfer @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ eq::alphasin ] ) to the @xmath34 scheme  @xcite and apply afterwards the supersymmetric one - loop corrections evaluated in ref .  @xcite relating the weak mixing angle in the sm to the one in mssm .",

    "we obtain @xmath75 at the scale @xmath70 including virtual mssm contributions .",
    "note that by construction these corrections are suppressed by the square of the supersymmetric mass scale .",
    "we anticipate that for typical supersymmetric benchmark scenarios the influence of supersymmetric corrections to @xmath75 can lead to shifts in @xmath3 which are of the order of 10% . for the msugra parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq::msugra_par1 ] ) the shift of @xmath75 amounts to about @xmath76 .",
    "in addition to the input values for the gauge coupling constants , we also need the @xmath77- and @xmath50-boson pole masses @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the top - quark and tau - lepton pole masses @xmath80 and @xmath81 and the running bottom - quark mass @xmath82 . for the convenience of the reader we also specify their numerical values  @xcite @xmath83 the corresponding uncertainties are not important for our analysis .    in the following we describe in detail the individual steps of the running analysis needed for the energy evolution of the gauge couplings from the scale @xmath70 to the unification scale .    1 .   running within the sm from @xmath70 to the susy scale @xmath84 .",

    "we take into account the tau , bottom and top yukawa couplings and thus solve a coupled system of six differential equations .",
    "since the quartic higgs coupling @xmath86 enters the equations of the yukawa couplings starting from two - loop order only we neglect its contribution . at this point",

    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the susy - qcd decoupling effects for @xmath89 and @xmath90 are known to two - loop order and have been computed in refs .",
    "the simultaneous decoupling might be problematic in case there is a huge splitting among the susy masses . in that case",
    "a step - by - step decoupling would be preferable ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , a two - loop calculation in that framework is still missing .",
    "furthermore , the mass splitting in almost all benchmark scenarios currently discussed in the literature is rather small . + as pointed out before , a fully consistent approach would require two - loop threshold corrections not only in the strong but also in the electroweak sector .",
    "they are not yet available , however , we also expect that their numerical impact is relatively small",
    ". furthermore , consistency with the rg running would require mixed qcd - yukawa corrections for @xmath89 which are not yet available .",
    "since the effect of these kind of corrections on the ( three - loop ) running is numerically small we expect that also the impact on the decoupling is small .",

    "+ at this stage also the change of renormalization scheme from @xmath65 to @xmath34 has to be taken into account .",

    "+ a suitable linear combination of the three one - loop equations for @xmath92 in  ( [ eq::dec ] ) and  ( [ eq::gutdec ] ) leads to the following two relations @xmath93 where @xmath30 has been eliminated .",
    "these equations allow for the prediction of the coloured triplet higgs boson mass @xmath3 from the knowledge of the mssm gauge couplings at the energy scale @xmath94 .",
    "it is furthermore common to define a new mass parameter @xmath95{m_x^2m_\\sigma}$ ] , the so - called grand unified mass scale , that can also be determined from the knowledge of the mssm gauge couplings at @xmath91 .",

    "the latest upper bound on the proton decay rate for the channel @xmath98  @xcite is @xmath99 . in order to translate it into a lower bound for the the higgs triplet mass",
    ", one needs an additional assumption about the yukawa couplings that enter the expression of the decay rate @xmath100 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite this is because down quark and lepton yukawa couplings fail to unify within the minimal renormalizable susy su(5 ) model and so a completely consistent treatment is not possible .",
    "therefore one could either choose is the yukawa coupling of the quark and lepton doublet to the higgs colour triplet .",
    "@xmath101 is the corresponding coupling for the up and down quark singlet . ]",
    "( i ) @xmath102 or ( ii ) @xmath103 , which leads to completely different phenomenological consequences .",
    "we are aware that both cases are equally justified once higher dimensional operators are included .",
    "since these operators further weaken the bounds presented below , we refrain to include them into the analysis in this paragraph . for the case ( i ) and",
    "sparticle masses around 1  tev the lower bound for the higgs triplet mass can be read off from fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and amounts to @xmath104gev whereas for the second choice it becomes @xmath105gev . from our phenomenological analysis",
    "presented above it turns out that within the minimal susy su(5 ) model the upper bound for @xmath25 is of about @xmath0gev .",
    "so , the substantial increase of about one order of magnitude for the upper bound on @xmath25 induced by the three - loop order running analysis attenuates the tension between the theoretical predictions made under the assumption ( i ) and the experimental data .",
    "the choice ( ii ) for the yukawa couplings clearly shows that the minimal susy su(5 ) model can not be ruled out by the current experimental data on proton decay rates .",
    "more experimental information about the susy mass spectrum and proton decay rates is required in order to be able to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "on the other hand , it is commonly recognized that susy su(5 ) in its minimal version can not provide the underlying model for a consistent gut because of the failure of yukawa unification . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of the most appealing solutions of this problem is the inclusion of @xmath48 scale effects using the effective theory approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , including higher dimensional operators .",
    "explicitly , this translates into  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the mass of the higgs triplet in the minimal renormalizable model . in this case , a suitable choice of the yukawa matrices can significantly reduce the proton decay amplitudes , so that values for @xmath25 of the order @xmath108 even for larger values of @xmath109 are allowed .",
    "so the prediction of the non - renormalizable version of the susy su(5 ) model is well under the experimental upper bound .",
    "however , the inclusion of new undetermined parameters together with the higher dimensional operators makes the tests of such models much more complicated .    at this point",
    "we try to compare with the findings of the analysis  @xcite based on the non - renormalizable version of minimal su(5 ) where the bound @xmath110  gev is given .",
    "this is the most stringent bound that can be derived from current proton decay experimental data . in order to be consistent with our upper bound on @xmath111 ( cf .",
    "[ fig::mhc_mgut_mz ] ) of about @xmath0  gev one requires @xmath112 which is a quite moderate value .",
    "already in the early days of the standard model there have been studies of theories which predict the unification of the coupling constants at high energies .",
    "since it is not possible to reach such energies in collider experiments it is necessary to establish relations between the couplings at the electroweak scale , where precise measurements are available , and the corresponding quantities at the unification scale .",
    "next to the beta functions covering the running also threshold corrections at the susy and gut scale constitute crucial input .",
    "we have considered the so - called minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) gut theory and have studied the gauge coupling unification applying one- , two- and three - loop running .",
    "the main effect of the three - loop running ( accompanied by two - loop decoupling relations ) is the stabilization w.r.t .",
    "the variation of the decoupling scales .",
    "in general sizable three - loop effects are observed if the decoupling scale for the supersymmetric particles is not chosen in the vicinity of the masses of the supersymmetric particles . in particular , for @xmath113 , which is the canonical choice often adopted in the literature , one observes an increase of the coloured higgs triplet mass by about an order of magnitude .",
    "already in previous studies it has been shown that the non - renormalizable version of minimal susy su(5 ) can not be excluded by the experimental bound on the proton decay rate  @xcite .",
    "our results attenuate the tension between the theoretical predictions of @xmath3 and the experimental results even more .",
    "our analysis includes all the state - of - the - art theoretical input .",
    "it could be improved by including the two - loop gut threshold corrections which are not yet available .",
    "this induces an uncertainty of about 0.3 on @xmath114 which constitutes the major theory - uncertainty .",
    "we observe that the effects of the two - loop gut threshold corrections become particularly important in the missing doublet model where also larger effects can be observed .",
    "as far as the parametric uncertainty is concerned we mention the dependence on the supersymmetric mass spectrum and the uncertainty on @xmath115 . in both cases a shift of @xmath3 of a few times @xmath116  gev is observed .",
    "the most popular extensions of the minimal susy su(5 ) model , the missing doublet model and the non - renormalizable version of the susy su(5 ) model comprising planck - scale operators , can not be excluded using only the currently available theoretical and experimental data .",
    "they either contain additional free parameters as compared to the minimal model or are affected by large theoretical uncertainties , so that no firm conclusion can be drawn for them .",
    "we would like to thank mikoaj misiak and robert harlander for carefully reading the manuscript and many useful comments .",
