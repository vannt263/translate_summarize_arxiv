    "the proton magnetic form factor at large momentum transfer has been extensively analyzed within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) over the last decade  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical basis of these calculations is the hard scattering formula  @xcite in which the proton form factor is generically expressed as a convolution of a hard - scattering amplitude @xmath5 and proton distribution amplitudes  ( da ) @xmath6 which represent valence quark fock state wave functions integrated over quark transverse momenta ( defined with respect to the momentum of their parent proton ) : @xmath7    \\int_{0}^{1}[dx^{\\prime } ]    |f_{n}(\\mu _ { f})|^{2}\\ ,    \\phi ^{\\star}(x^{\\prime},\\mu _ { f } )    t_{h}(x , x^{\\prime},q,\\mu ) \\phi ( x,\\mu _ { f } ) , \\label{eq : gm}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the invariant momentum transfer squared and @xmath8=dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3}\\delta ( 1-\\sum_{}^{}x_{i})$ ] , @xmath9 being the momentum fractions carried by the valence quarks . the renormalization scale is denoted by @xmath10 and the factorization scale by @xmath11 .",
    "the latter scale defines the interface between soft physics  absorbed in the wave function  and hard physics , treated explicitly within pqcd .",
    "the dimensionful constant @xmath12 represents the value of the proton wave function at the origin of the configuration space and has to be determined nonperturbatively  @xcite .",
    "the residual ( mainly perturbative ) scale dependence of @xmath12 and that of the proton da is controlled by the evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "to lowest order the hard scattering amplitude is calculated as the sum of all feynman diagrams for which the three quark lines are connected pairwise by two gluon propagators .",
    "this allows the quarks in the initial and final proton to be viewed as moving collinearly up to transverse momenta of order @xmath11 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath13 , wherein @xmath0 is the running strong coupling constant in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the pauli form factor @xmath14 and hence the electric form factor @xmath15 can not be calculated within the hard scattering picture ( hsp ) , since they require helicity - flip transitions which are not possible for ( almost ) massless quarks .",
    "these form factors are dominated by sizeable higher twist contributions as we know from experiment  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : gm ] ) is obtained by taking the + component of the electromagnetic vertex and represents the helicity - conserving part of the form factor .",
    "the choice of the renormalization scale in the calculation of the proton form factor is a crucial point .",
    "most authors  @xcite use a constant @xmath0 outside the integrals over fractional momenta , with an argument rescaled by the characteristic virtualities for each particular model da .",
    "choosing @xmath10 that way and using das calculated by means of qcd sum rules  distributions whose essential characteristic is a strong asymmetry in phase space ",
    "results for @xmath16 have been obtained  @xcite that compare fairly well with the data  @xcite . on the other hand , the so - called `` asymptotic '' da  @xcite @xmath17 into which any da should evolve with @xmath18yields a vanishing result for @xmath19 . however , for a renormalization scale independent of x , large contributions from higher orders are expected in the endpoint region , @xmath20 . indeed , for the pion form factor this has been shown explicitly , at least for the next - to - leading order  @xcite .",
    "such large higher - order contributions would render the leading - order calculation useless .",
    "a more appropriate choice of the renormalization scale would be , e.g. , @xmath21 , since such a scale would eliminate the large logarithms arising from the higher - order contributions .",
    "unfortunately , this is achieved at the expense that @xmath0 becomes singular in the endpoint regions .",
    "it has been conjectured  @xcite that gluonic radiative corrections ( sudakov factors ) will suppress that @xmath0-singularity and , therefore , in practical applications of the hsp one may handle this difficulty by cutting off @xmath0 at a certain value , typically chosen in the range 0.5 to 0.7 .",
    "another , semi - phenomenological recipe to avoid the singularity of @xmath0 is to introduce an effective gluon mass  @xcite which cut - offs the interaction at low @xmath1 values .",
    "besides the extreme sensitivity of the form factors on the utilized da and besides the problem with higher - order contributions and/or the singularity of @xmath22 , there is still another  perhaps more fundamental ",
    "difficulty with such calculations .",
    "indeed , the applicability of ( [ eq : gm ] ) at experimentally accessible momentum transfer , typically a few gev , is not _ a priori _ justified .",
    "it was argued by isgur and llewellyn - smith  @xcite and also by radyushkin  @xcite that the hsp receives its main contributions from the soft endpoint regions , rendering the perturbative calculation inconsistent .",
    "recently , this criticism has been challenged by sterman and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "based on previous works by collins , soper , and sterman  @xcite , they have calculated sudakov corrections to the hard - scattering process taking into account the conventionally neglected transverse momentum , @xmath23 , of the quarks .",
    "the sudakov corrections damp those contributions from the endpoint regions in which transverse momenta of the quarks are not large enough to keep the exchanged gluons hard .",
    "moreover , as presumed , the sudakov corrections cancel the @xmath22-singularity without introducing additional _ ad hoc _ cut - off parameters as for instance a gluon mass . thus the modified hsp provides a well - defined expression for the form factor which takes into account the perturbative contributions in a self - consistent way , even for momentum transfers as low as a few gev",
    "however , an important element has not been considered in the analyses of refs .",
    "this concerns the inclusion of the intrinsic transverse momentum of the hadronic wave function .",
    "as it was recently shown by two of us  @xcite for the case of the pion form factor , the inclusion of the transverse size of the pion extends considerably the self - consistency region of the perturbative contribution down to values of momentum transfer unreachable by the sudakov corrections alone . on the other hand",
    ", the incorporation of the @xmath23-dependence leads to a substantial decrease of the magnitude of the ( leading - order ) pion form factor .",
    "unfortunately , a clear - cut comparison with the available data is not possible because of their low quality and the uncertainty in the determination of the pion - nucleon coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to expect that the pion form factor receives considerable soft contributions in the presently accessible gev region .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to perform an analysis for the proton form factor within the modified hsp .",
    "one of our objectives is to critically examine li s approach  @xcite and to enlarge the theoretical framework by including the intrinsic @xmath23-dependence of the proton wave function . at the same time",
    "we want to clarify several technical points , which are absent in the pion case and are first encountered in the more complicated calculation of the proton form factor .",
    "the purpose of our analysis is to investigate how reliably the perturbative contribution to the proton form factor can be calculated and to answer the question whether there is a proton wave function ",
    "modeled on the basis of qcd sum rules  @xcite  which is capable of providing , in a theoretically self - consistent way , a good agreement with the data within the modified hsp .",
    "it is clear that being able to identify the leading - order perturbative contribution reliably allows us to estimate the size of soft contributions to the proton form factor , contributions which are not accounted for in the modified hsp formalism .",
    "[ note that the @xmath23-dependent effects taken into account in the modified hsp represent also soft contributions of higher - twist type . ]    sudakov suppression ( which can be viewed as the perturbative part of the transverse wave function ) and intrinsic @xmath23-dependence of the wave function may also have a lot of interesting consequences in other exclusive reactions .",
    "thus , for instance , sotiropoulos and sterman  @xcite have applied these elements to near - forward proton - proton elastic scattering claiming that their interplay drives the transition of the fixed @xmath24 differential cross section from the @xmath25 behavior at moderate @xmath26 to the @xmath27 behavior at larger @xmath26 , as predicted by dimensional counting rules  @xcite .",

    "radiative corrections with wave lengths between the ir cut - off and an upper limit ( related to the physical momentum q ) yield to suppression ; it is understood that still softer gluonic corrections are already taken care of in the hadron wave function , whereas harder gluons are considered as part of @xmath5 .",
    "different choices of the ir cut - off have been used in the literature : thus , li  @xcite chooses @xmath124 ( this choice hereafter is termed the `` l '' prescription ) , whereas hyer  @xcite in his analysis of the proton - antiproton annihilation into two photons and of the time - like proton form factor as well as sotiropoulos and sterman  @xcite take @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ( this choice is denoted the `` h - ss '' prescription ) . still another possibility , and",
    "the one proposed in the present work for reasons that will be explained below is to use as ir cut - off the maximum of the three interquark separations , i.e. , to set @xmath128 this choice , designated by `` max '' , is analogous to that in the meson case , wherein the quark - antiquark distance naturally provides a secure ir cut - off .",
    "the specific features of each particular cut - off choice will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : singularities ] .",
    "the integrals in  ( [ eq : s ] ) arise from the application of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "the evolution from one scale value to another is governed by the anomalous dimensions of the involved operators .",
    "the integrals combine the effects of the application of the rge on the wave functions and on the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "the range of validity of ( [ eq : s ] ) for the sudakov functions is limited to not too small @xmath129 values . whenever @xmath130 is large relative to the hard ( gluon ) scale @xmath131 , the gluonic corrections are to be considered as higher - order corrections to @xmath5 and hence are not contained in the sudakov factor but are absorbed in @xmath5 . for that reason ,",
    "li  @xcite sets any sudakov function @xmath106 equal to zero whenever @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , li holds the sudakov factor @xmath104 equal to unity whenever it exceeds this value , which is the case in the small @xmath123-region .",
    "actually , the full expression  ( [ eq : s ] ) shows in this region a small enhancement resulting from the interplay of the next - to - leading logarithmic contributions to the sudakov exponents and the integrals over the anomalous dimensions .",
    "we follow the same lines of argument in our analysis .",
    "the ir cut - offs @xmath130 in the sudakov exponents mark the interface between the nonperturbatively soft momenta , which are implicitly accounted for in the proton wave function , and the contributions from soft gluons , incorporated in a perturbative way in the sudakov factors .",
    "obviously , the ir cut - off serves at the same time as the gliding factorization scale @xmath11 to be used in the evolution of the wave function .",
    "for that reason , li  @xcite as well as sotiropoulos and sterman  @xcite take @xmath133 .",
    "the `` max '' prescription ( [ eq : max ] ) , adopted in the present work , naturally complies with the choice of the evolution scale proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the inclusion of an @xmath62-dependent renormalization scale in the argument of @xmath0 within the standard hsp of brodsky - lepage  @xcite presents the difficulty that the value of @xmath0 becomes singular in the endpoint regions . to render the form factors ( eq .  ( [ eq : gm ] ) ) finite , additional external parameters , like an effective gluon mass  @xcite or a cut - off prescription have to be introduced .",
    "technically , such parameters play the rle of ir regulators serving to regularize one of the gluon propagators , which may become soft along the boundaries of phase space ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the crucial advantages of the modified hsp , proposed by sterman and collaborators  @xcite , is that there is no need for external regulators because the sudakov factor may suppress the singularities of the `` bare '' ( one - loop ) @xmath135 inherently . indeed in the pion case",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that the transverse quark - antiquark separation is tantamount to an ir regulator which suffices to cancel all singularities from the soft region .",
    "concerning the proton form factor , the situation is much more complicated because more scales are involved and hence the choice of the appropriate ir cut - off parameters @xmath123 is not obvious , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii . as we shall effect in the following",
    ", the cancellation of the @xmath0-singularities by the sudakov factor depends sensitively on that particular choice .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sudakov ] we display the exponential of the sudakov function @xmath136 $ ] for @xmath137 by imposing li s requirement  @xcite : @xmath138 whenever @xmath139 .",
    "ultimately , the cancellation of the @xmath0-singularities relies on the fact that whenever one of the @xmath0 tends to infinity ( owing to the limit @xmath140 ) , the sudakov factor @xmath104 rapidly decreases to zero . as it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : sudakov ] this is not the case in the region determined by @xmath141 and simultaneously @xmath142 , where @xmath136 $ ] is fixed to unity . in the pion case",
    "this does not matter , since the other @xmath143\\to 0 $ ] faster than any power of @xmath144 $ ] and , consequently , the sudakov factor drops to zero .",
    "in contrast , the treatment of the proton form factor is more subtle . in that case",
    ", @xmath104 does not necessarily vanish fast enough to guarantee the cancellation of the @xmath0-singularities .",
    "this can be illustrated by the following configuration : if , say , @xmath145 and @xmath146 then @xmath147 and @xmath148 can have any value between 0 and @xmath149 .",
    "since @xmath150 is unrestricted within the limits @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the corresponding exponentials of the sudakov functions @xmath153 $ ] and @xmath154 $ ] do not automatically fall off to zero in order to yield sufficient suppression of the @xmath0-singularities , unless all three @xmath123 are coerced to be equal .",
    "if the three @xmath123 are allowed to be different , then the sudakov factor provides suppression only through the contributions of the anomalous dimensions . according to the `` l '' and `` h - ss '' prescriptions , which , in general , allow for different @xmath123 in the sudakov functions , the integrand in ( [ eq : g_m(b ) ] ) has singularities behaving as @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath157 hold fixed .",
    "the maximum degree of divergence is given by @xmath158 where the first term @xmath159 comes from the evolution of @xmath12 , ( [ eq : f_n ] ) and the constant @xmath160 is related to the anomalous dimension driving the evolution behavior of the proton da , see ( [ eq : phi ] ) and table  1 : @xmath160 is the maximum value of the @xmath161 within a given polynomial order of the expansion of the da . we reiterate that the @xmath45 are positive fractional numbers increasing with @xmath162 .",
    "thus the singular behavior of the integrand becomes worse as the expansion in terms of appell polynomials extends to higher and higher orders .",
    "the term @xmath163 in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) stems from the integrations over the anomalous dimensions in the sudakov factor @xmath104 ( see ( [ eq : s ] ) ) .",
    "finally , the term @xmath152 originates from that @xmath164 which becomes singular in ( [ eq : g_m(b ) ] ) , c.f .",
    ", ( [ eq : t_ij ] ) .",
    "which one of the @xmath0 couplings becomes actually singular , depends on the prescription imposed on the ir cut - off parameters @xmath123 .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : g_m(b ) ] ) does not exist if @xmath165 .",
    "as table  1 reveals , this happens already for proton das which include appell polynomials of order 1 , i.e. , for all das except for the asymptotic one : @xmath17 .",
    "thus application of the `` l '' and `` h - ss '' prescriptions on the choice of the ir cut - off parameters @xmath123 to the proton form factor entails the modified hsp to be invalid .",
    "in view of these results , li s analysis of the proton form factor  @xcite seems to be seriously flawed .",
    "a simple recipe to bypass the singular behavior of the integrand is to ignore completely the evolution of the da or to `` freeze '' it at any ( arbitrary ) value larger than @xmath166 .",
    "hyer  @xcite suggested to take for the factorization scale @xmath167 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath160 appears in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) only if all three @xmath123 tend to @xmath168 at once .",
    "but then at least one of the @xmath136 $ ] drops to @xmath151 faster than any power of @xmath169 .",
    "apparently , hyer s choice of the factorization scale avoids singularities of the form ( [ eq : sing ] ) , but seems to us physically implausible .",
    "since he only presents numerical results for the proton form factor in the time - like region , we can not compare with his results directly .",
    "another option , and actually the one proposed in this work , is to use a common ir cut - off not only for the evolution of the wave function but also in the sudakov exponent . for a common cut - off @xmath170",
    ", the sudakov factors always cancel the @xmath0-singularities ; if , for a given @xmath171 , we are in the dangerous region , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , at least one of the other two sudakov functions lies in the region @xmath174 , @xmath173 ( @xmath175 ) and therefore provides sufficient suppression , as outlined above . in particular , we favor @xmath176 as the optimum choice ( `` max '' prescription ) , since it does not only lead to a regular integral but also to a non - singular integrand .",
    "the sudakov factor @xmath177 subject to the `` l '' and `` max '' prescriptions is plotted for a specific quark configuration in fig .  [",
    "fig : bcplots ] .",
    "this figure makes it apparent that the sudakov factor in connection with the `` max '' prescription is unencumbered by singularities in the dangerous soft regions . as a consequence of the regularizing power of the `` max '' prescription , the perturbative contribution to the proton form factor (  [ eq : g_m(b ) ] ) saturates in the sense that the results become insensitive to the inclusion of the soft regions .",
    "a saturation as strong as possible is a prerequisite for the self - consistency of the modified hsp , as will be discussed in sec .  v.    to demonstrate the amount of saturation",

    "[ evolution has been dispensed with to avoid the concomitant singularity in @xmath179 as @xmath180 when imposing the `` l '' and `` h - ss '' prescriptions . ]",
    "as one sees from the figure , the `` max '' prescription leads indeed to saturation ; the soft region @xmath181 does not contribute to the form factor substantially .",
    "in fact , already @xmath182 of the result are obtained from the regions with @xmath183 .",
    "note that @xmath0 increases to a value of @xmath184 at @xmath185 .",
    "this indicates that a sizeable fraction of the contributions to the form factor is accumulated in the perturbative region .",
    "unfortunately , this saturation is achieved at the expense of a rather strong damping of the perturbative contribution to the proton form factor . using the two other prescriptions ( `` l '' and `` h - ss '' ) and ignoring evolution , we have found larger results for @xmath16 , but no indication for saturation : the additional contributions to the form factor gained this way are accumulated exclusively in the soft regions , i.e. , for values of @xmath186 near @xmath152 .",
    "these findings are in evident contradiction to li s results ( figure 5 in  @xcite ) for which an acceptable saturation has been claimed . on the other hand",
    ", we can qualitatively confirm the saturation behavior of the proton form factor calculated by hyer  @xcite in the time - like region .",
    "since we regard a saturation behavior as a stringent test for the self - consistent applicability of pqcd , calculations which accumulate large contributions from soft regions ( large @xmath178 ) can not be considered as theoretically legitimate .",
    "the rle of the evolution effect subject to the `` max '' prescription is also exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_m(b_c ) ] .",
    "it shows that the effect of evolution is large , although finite , owing to the strong suppression provided by the sudakov factor .",
    "note that according to our discussion in sec .",
    "iii , the factorization scale is @xmath187 .",
    "the significant feature of the evolution effect is that it tends to neutralize the influence of the ir cut - off .",
    "thus one obtains larger values of the proton form factor at the expense of a slightly worse saturation .",
    "in this section we give numerical results for the proton form factor . in these calculations",

    "we emphasize that in contrast to pure phenomenological recipies ( e.g. , the introduction of a gluon mass ) , the modified hsp provides an explicit scheme how the ir protection of the `` bare '' @xmath0 proceeds through gluonic radiation accumulated in the sudakov factor .",

    "the other choices of the ir cut - off ( `` l '' , `` h - ss '' ) , we have discussed , do not lead to saturation .    however , this reliable saturation and ir protection of the form factor is achieved at the expense of a strong reduction of the perturbative contribution to the form factor .",

    "the fact that in all considered cases the self - consistently calculated perturbative contribution to the proton form factor fails to reproduce the existing data , is perhaps a signal that soft contributions ( higher twists ) not accounted for so far by the modified hsp should be included .",
    "such contributions comprise , e.g. , improved and/or more complicated wave functions , orbital angular momentum , higher fock components , quark - quark correlations ( diquarks ) , radiative corrections to the quark and gluon condensates , quark masses , etc .",
    "also remainders of genuine soft contributions , like vector - meson - dominance terms or the overlap of the soft parts of the wave functions ( feynman contributions ) , may still be large at accessible momentum transfers .",
    "the rather large value of the pauli form factor @xmath14 around @xmath4  gev@xmath3 , as found experimentally  @xcite , indicates that sizeable higher - twist contributions still exist in that region of momentum transfer  @xcite .",

    "large ( perturbative ) higher - order corrections to the hard - scattering amplitude can not be excluded as well , since their size has not yet been estimated . in analogy to the drell - yan process , these corrections may be condensed in a k - factor multiplying the leading - order perturbative result . however , with our choice of the renormalization scale , the k - factor is expected to be close to unity .",
    "at least for the case of the pion form factor , calculations of the k - factor to one - loop order exist  @xcite , which indicate that choosing the renormalization scale analogously to ours , the value of the k - factor is indeed close to unity .",
    "in conclusion we note that it was not our primary aim to use the modified hsp to obtain best agreement with the data , although from our point of view this scheme represents a decisive step towards a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic form factors . in the present work",
