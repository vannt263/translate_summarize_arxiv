    "properties of finite - dimensional spin glasses are still under debate although the problem is essentially settled for the mean - field model @xcite .",
    "outstanding problems for finite - dimensional spin glasses include the existence or absence of spin glass phase and whether or not the mean - field picture of the spin glass phase applies . another interesting , but less extensively studied , issue is the structure of the phase diagram , in particular where precisely the multicritical point is located and what the values are for the critical exponents characterizing the system behaviour at and away the multicritical point .",
    "the present paper discusses this problem of the location of the multicritical point for finite - dimensional spin glass models by analytical methods .",
    "a number of numerical investigations on this problem exist for various lattices .",
    "however , it has been quite difficult to derive analytical results for regular finite - dimensional lattices until a few years ago when we succeeded in devising a method to predict the exact locations of the multicritical points for the square lattice ising and potts models and four - dimensional random plaquette gauge model using duality , gauge symmetry and the replica method @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this theoretical framework so that it is applicable to a pair of mutually - dual lattices , for which our theory relates the pair of values of multicritical points of the two lattices .",
    "the logic of our theory includes a step which is yet to be justified rigorously , and hence the status of our result is a conjecture at this moment .",
    "nevertheless , our theory enables us to understand all the relevant available numerical data for the multicritical points derived independently by a number of authors .",
    "also our theory satisfies necessary conditions which the exact solution should satisfy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall the basic formulation which was developed in our previous studies in order to fix the notation and set the stage for further developments in the following sections . in section 3 , a generalization of the theory to non - self - dual @xmath2 ( ising ) models with randomness",
    "is discussed .",
    "this argument is followed by section 4 , in which we further generalize the arguments to @xmath1 systems with chiral randomness .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the duality arguments in @xcite applied to the two - dimensional ( @xmath3 ) @xmath0 random bond ising model on the square lattice and the @xmath4 random @xmath2 lattice gauge model , by which we fix the notation and set a stage for generalizations in the following sections . after recalling the duality arguments for non - random systems",
    ", we apply the idea to random systems .",
    "we first elucidate the duality of a non - random @xmath2 ( ising ) system @xcite .",
    "let us prepare a @xmath5-dimensional lattice and assign @xmath6 spins on @xmath7 dimensional elements @xmath8 on the lattice , which we denote by @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a model on the lattice whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-dimensional element on the lattice and @xmath13 is its boundary of dimension @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the boltzmann factor for an element @xmath11 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "for the case of the usual ising model @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the bond ( edge ) boltzmann factor for parallel spins at both ends and @xmath19 is for anti - parallel spins .",
    "then the partition function @xmath20 is a function of @xmath14 ; @xmath21 .",
    "the dual model is defined on the dual lattice ( the definition of which is given in @xcite ) .",
    "the dual boltzmann factor for the dual element @xmath22 is defined by the two - component fourier transformation of @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath23 for the present hamiltonian ( [ generalspin ] ) , the dual hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 which is of the same form as equation ( [ generalspin ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the dual element of @xmath11 and has dimension @xmath26 .",
    "next we derive the dual expression of the partition function for general dual pairs . the partition function",

    "hence ( [ o_d ] ) is simplified to @xmath37 where the symbol @xmath38 is simplified to @xmath39 . from this expression it is seen that @xmath39 is invariant under the exchange @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which means self - duality of the partition function .",
    "the critical point of a self - dual model is obtained , if it is unique , by the fixed - point condition for these boltzmann factors , @xmath42 , which yields @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that this transition point is shared by the 2@xmath5 ising model on the square lattice , the 4@xmath5 @xmath2 gauge model on the hypercubic lattice and their higher dimensional generalizations @xcite .",
    "let us introduce randomness . to investigate critical points of random systems with the aid of the duality formalism",
    ", we will utilize the technique of reference @xcite with some modifications .",
    "the random model treated here is a system with @xmath2 variables and bimodal randomness .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a quenched random variable dependent on each element @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath45 takes the value @xmath46 with probability @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 . to treat random systems , we employ the standard replica method .",
    "let us consider the @xmath50-replicated system and define the averaged boltzmann factor @xmath51 for an element @xmath11 , which corresponds to the configuration @xmath52 in @xmath53 replicas and @xmath48 in @xmath54 replicas .",

    "the explicit forms are obtained by the two - component fourier transformation with the result @xmath59 where @xmath54 is a non - negative integer in the range @xmath60 .",
    "the partition function satisfies a generalization of ( [ o_d ] ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an appropriate constant .",
    "now we restrict our attention to the case where the system is self - dual when we remove randomness ( e.g. 2@xmath5 @xmath0 random bond ising model on the square lattice ) . using ( [ 5a ] )",
    "we can express the self duality of the @xmath50-replicated partition function for such a system as @xmath63 where an overall constant is neglected .",
    "thus self duality is recognized by the fact that @xmath64 is invariant when the exchanges @xmath65 for all @xmath54 are performed simultaneously .",
    "it is in general impossible to identify the transition point from the fixed - point condition of the duality relation ( [ selfdual ] ) , unlike the non - random case because the fixed - point conditions of all the variables @xmath66 are not satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the authors of @xcite nevertheless developed an argument leading to a conjecture that the fixed - point condition of the leading boltzmann factor @xmath67 can well be the most plausible candidate to give the exact transition point of the random system at least on the nishimori line ( nl ) @xcite , @xmath68 , where enhanced symmetry simplifies the system properties significantly .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed to be correct in the cases of @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that numerical results for the quenched limit @xmath71 @xcite agree very well with the conjectured value of @xmath72 which is the solution to the formula obtained in the @xmath71 limit of @xmath73 on the nl : @xmath74 this conjecture also leads us to an interesting result that the multicritical points of the @xmath3 @xmath0 random bond ising model and the @xmath4 random @xmath2 lattice gauge model ( random plaquette gauge model ) are located at the same point on the @xmath47-@xmath75 plane @xcite .",
    "this observation has also been confirmed numerically by a recent study @xcite .",
    "determination of the multicritical point is also quite important from the standpoint of the quantum information theory , quantum memory in particular . to be specific , the value @xmath76 at the multicritical point of the @xmath3 random bond ising model is equivalent to the accuracy threshold of the @xmath3 toric code with perfect measurement @xcite , which is estimated to be @xmath77 from the above discussion .",
    "in addition , the value @xmath76 at the multicritical point of the @xmath4 random gauge model also gives the accuracy threshold of the @xmath4 toric code ( or @xmath78 code with imperfect measurement ) @xcite , which is also determined as @xmath77 .",
    "with the knowledge of the previous section in mind , we proceed to discussions on the non - self - dual cases with and without randomness .      in this subsection",
    ", we develop an argument for duality of generic non - self - dual @xmath2 models .",
    "it is clear that a simple duality relation like ( [ o_d ] ) is not enough to determine the transition point .",
    "nevertheless we show that , by generalizing the arguments in the previous section , one can still derive a relation between the transition points of a model and its dual .",
    "first let us discuss non - random systems .",
    "consider the product of partition functions of the original and dual models with inverse temperatures @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . from ( [ o_d ] ) , one finds @xmath81 which indicates that the product is invariant under the simultaneous exchange @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "hence , if there is a unique transition point @xmath84 ( resp .",
    "@xmath85 ) in the original ( resp . dual ) model , the relation between two critical points is expected to be given by @xmath86 which is invariant under the transformation above .",
    "one can verify that this is equivalent to @xmath87 , which gives the correct relation between the two transition points .",
    "now we move on to random systems . in this case",
    ", we can express the duality between two random models ( [ 5a ] ) as follows , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the probability of positive interaction and the inverse temperature for the original / dual models , respectively .",
    "thus the product of the partition functions is invariant under the simultaneous exchange @xmath91 and @xmath92 for all @xmath54 .",
    "the argument developed so far naturally suggests that the relation between the critical points of the original and dual systems is given by the fixed - point condition of the leading boltzmann factors at least on the nl .",
    "explicitly , this condition reads @xmath93 in conjunction with the nl condition @xmath94 equation ( [ selfdual3 ] ) with ( [ nl ] ) is written in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath96 as @xmath97 we expect that the two multicritical points are related by this equation .",
    "if the quenched ( @xmath98 ) limit is taken , this yields the relation , @xmath99 where @xmath100 therefore our main statement for the non - self - dual @xmath2 model is the following : the two critical points on the nls of the mutually - dual systems with quenched randomness are expected to be related by equation ( [ dualcriticalpoint ] ) .",
    "there are many reasons to believe that our conjecture expressed in ( [ dual_mc_n ] ) and ( [ dualcriticalpoint ] ) is exact .",
    "some of them are given in the rest of this paper .",
    "for simplicity the discussion in the following is restricted to the @xmath3 random bond ising models on the mutually - dual lattices such as the hexagonal and triangular lattices , though the conjecture applies quite generally to arbitrary systems described by the hamiltonian ( [ generalrandomspin ] ) .    before closing the present subsection",
    ", we explain an explicit representation of the dual random models @xcite , which is necessary in the following discussions",
    ". the ratios of dual boltzmann factors ( [ dualboltzmann ] ) to @xmath101 are @xmath102 these ratios of boltzmann factors are realized by a system with the following explicit boltzmann factors written in terms of ising spin variables @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the product of ising spin variables in the @xmath54th replica .",
    "for example , in the case of the usual nearest neighbour interactions , @xmath104 stands for @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined by @xmath108 from the expression ( [ dualrep ] ) , the dual of the @xmath0 random bond ising model can be interpreted as the model with the non - random ising interaction in each replica and the interaction between replicas .",
    "if the condition of the nl , @xmath109 , is imposed , this turns to @xmath110      let us first show that the relation ( [ selfdual3 ] ) gives the exact answer even without the nl condition when @xmath111 .",
    "equation ( [ selfdual3 ] ) is , for @xmath111 , @xmath112 > from the expression ( [ dualrep ] ) , it is found that the @xmath113 random bond ising model for @xmath111 , averaged over randomness , is regarded as a non - random ising model with coupling @xmath114 on the dual lattice .",
    "for example , the random bond ising model on the 2@xmath5 triangular lattice with parameters @xmath115 and @xmath79 is equivalent to the non - random ising model on the hexagonal lattice , whose inverse temperature @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is defined by the second expression of ( [ kkp ] ) with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath119 .",
    "conversely , the random bond ising model on the 2@xmath5 hexagonal lattice with parameters @xmath120 and @xmath80 corresponds to the non - random ising model on the triangular lattice , whose inverse temperature @xmath121 is @xmath122 as is well - known , the non - random ising models on the 2@xmath5 triangular and the hexagonal lattices are mutually - dual , and two critical inverse temperatures satisfy @xcite @xmath123 using equation ( [ dualkp ] ) we can confirm the equivalence between equations ( [ dualn1 ] ) and ( [ dualpuren1 ] ) .",
    "note that the condition of the nl is not used , and this equivalence holds everywhere on the phase boundary .",
    "next we discuss the two - replica case . equation ( [ selfdual3 ] ) for @xmath124 is @xmath125 in the rest of this subsection , we restrict our attention onto the nl .    due to the dual representation ( [ dualrep2 ] ) for @xmath124 , we know that the random bond ising model is equivalent to the non - random four - state potts model on the dual lattice ; four states are constructed by the direct product of ising factors in two replicas @xmath126 , and the dual boltzmann factor is @xmath127 for @xmath128 and @xmath129 otherwise",
    ". therefore the system corresponds to the four - state potts model on the dual lattice with coupling @xmath130 , namely , @xmath131 for example , the random bond ising model on the triangular lattice is equivalent to the non - random four - state potts model on the hexagonal lattice and vice versa .",
    "here we denote the parameters of the random bond ising model on the triangular lattice by @xmath132 and that on the hexagonal lattice by @xmath133",
    ". then the inverse temperatures of the corresponding four - state potts models @xmath134 are given by @xmath135 as mentioned above .",
    "the dual coupling @xmath136 ( or @xmath137 ) is defined by equation ( [ dualkp ] ) .",
    "the inverse critical temperatures of the four - state potts models on mutually - dual lattices satisfy @xcite @xmath138 it is straightforward to show that equation ( [ dualn2 ] ) is equivalent to equation ( [ dualpuren2 ] ) under the nl condition ( [ nl ] ) .",
    "next is an argument for the @xmath140 limit .",
    "the partition function for arbitrary @xmath50 is expressed as @xmath141_{\\rm av } = [ e^{-n \\beta n f(k)}]_{\\rm av},\\ ] ] where @xmath142 is the number of sites and @xmath143 is the free energy for the inverse temperature @xmath75 . if the replica number @xmath50 is taken to be quite large , the averaged partition function is dominated by the configuration of the smallest value of @xmath143 , which is realized by the perfect ferromagnetic bond configuration and its gauge equivalents . using this argument @xmath144",
    "can be approximated as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the free energy of the non - random ferromagnetic system .",
    "therefore the random bond ising system for @xmath147 is interpreted as the non - random ferromagnetic ising system ( and its critical point is denoted by @xmath84 ) .",
    "we also consider the random bond ising model on the dual lattice , and for @xmath140 we can regard it as the non - random ising model with the critical point @xmath148 .",
    "these two critical points are related by the well - known equation , @xmath149 if we consider the @xmath140 limit of equation ( [ selfdual3 ] ) combined with the nl condition ( [ nl ] ) , we obtain @xmath150 which is equivalent to equation ( [ dualninfty ] ) .      we have checked the relation ( [ dualcriticalpoint ] ) in the quenched limit numerically .",
    "we executed monte carlo simulations for the @xmath3 random bond ising models on the hexagonal and the triangular lattices , a dual pair . to observe the criticality",
    ", we make use of the non - equilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method @xcite , which yields the power - law behaviour of decreasing magnetization with monte carlo steps on criticality . for this method",
    "we prepare all - up spins as the initial state and let them relax in each monte carlo step . in order to identify the multicritical point , we choose the parameters of the system to be on the nl and vary the parameter @xmath47 ( and @xmath75 is also varied accordingly ) .",

    "the accuracy threshold of the @xmath3 toric code with imperfect measurement can be determined by the value @xmath76 at the multicritical point of the @xmath78 random gauge model @xcite .",
