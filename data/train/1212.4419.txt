    "horizontal branch ( hb ) stars are the progeny of low - mass red giant branch stars ( rgb ) burning helium in their cores and hydrogen in a shell around it ( hoyle & schwarzschild 1955 ) .",
    "as first noticed by iben & rood ( 1970 ) , the different hb star colour distributions observed in old stellar systems , is the reflection of the amount of mass lost during the rgb phase .",
    "+ the scientific community agrees from nearly fifty years about the fact that the principal parameter governing the shape of hbs in galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) is metallicity .",
    "the general rule is that metal - rich systems have red hbs , while in the metal - poor ones stars are distributed on average at higher effective temperatures ( bluer colours ) .",
    "several exceptions have come out during the last decades ; remarkable cases the cases of ngc6388 and ngc6441 ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , which despite their metallicity ( @xmath5\\sim-0.6 $ ] ) show some of the bluest hbs known among ggcs ( busso et al . 2007",
    "; dalessandro et al .",
    "moreover several clusters , sharing similar metal content , reveal different hb morphologies , typical cases being the pairs ngc5927 - ngc6388 at high metallicities ( @xmath5\\sim-0.4 $ ] ) , m3 - m13 at intermediate metallicity regime ( @xmath5\\sim-1.5 $ ] ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ) and m15 - m92 at low metallicities ( @xmath5\\sim-2.3 $ ] ) .",
    "+ these noticeable exceptions have required the introduction of a second ( freeman & norris 1981 ) and possibly a third parameter in order to explain the hb distributions in all ggcs .",
    "what we can call now the _",
    "`` i - th parameter problem '' _ is still a hot topic , as stressed by several authors , we recall the reader to catelan 2009 for a nice review ( see also dotter et al . 2010 and gratton et al . 2010 ; hereafter d10 and g10 respectively ) . +",
    "an accurate knowledge of the physical parameters playing a role in shaping the hb is extremely important also for an appropriate interpretation of distant unresolved stellar populations .",
    "in fact it is well known that the hb morphology can have a strong impact on the integrated light of stellar populations , affecting colours and line indices ( lee et al .",
    "2002 ; schiavon et al .",
    "2004 ; percival & salaris 2011 ; dalessandro et al . 2012 ) . + despite the huge efforts made to address this problem , its solution is not obvious and still different scenarios are proposed .",
    "one of the reasons that complicates the identification of the mechanisms  other than metallicity  at work in shaping the observed luminosity and effective temperature distribution of stars along the hb is that there are many possible culprits ( mass - loss , age , helium abundance ... ; see rood 1973 for example ) and some of them are not well constrained from theory .",
    "+ age has been identified as the natural global second parameter by many authors in the past years ( lee et al .",
    "1987 , 1988 , 1990 ; lee , demarque & zinn 1994 ; sarajedini & king 1989 ) . according to this interpretation",
    "older clusters tend to have bluer hbs , while younger ones should have on average redder hb morphologies .",
    "this scenario appeared in agreement with the picture for the galaxy formation and its early evolution ( searle & zinn 1978 ; zinn 1985 ) . by means of high resolution hst data for a large sample of ggcs , d10 found that the existence of outer halo gcs with anomalously red hbs fits well the scenario in which age is the second parameter .",
    "in fact , the behaviour of the 4 - 5 relatively younger clusters in their sample could be reproduced in term of correlation between age and hb morphology , while the bulk of the analyzed targets is peaked around old ages ( see ages reported by salaris & weiss 2002 , g10 , d10 ) and does nt show any obvious correlation .",
    "also results by g10 agree on the fact that age is the second main parameter driving the hb morphology .",
    "+ it is also worth noticing that most of these results are based on optical cmds and hb morphology parameters ( like the well known hbr from lee et al .",
    "1994 ) , which tend to minimize the importance of blue tails . on the contrary using proper combinations of ultra - violet ( uv ) and optical filters has an important impact both in term of hb classification and comparison with theoretical models .",
    "still , age is not able to explain exhaustively the hb morphology .",
    "detailed cluster to cluster comparisons have shown that there are systems with similar iron content and age , but remarkably different hb morphologies .",
    "a clear example is given by the three clusters m3 - m13 - m80 , as shown by ferraro et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) and at present there is hardly a scenario able to give a satisfactory explanation for their different morphologies . + as suggested by buonanno et al .",

    "( 1993 ) , age might be one of many and probably the most important hb second - parameter , but not the only one .",
    "buonanno et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argued that it is not possible to reproduce the complex hb zoology with a single `` global '' parameter , but more likely we can explain it by thinking of a `` global combination '' of `` non - global '' quantities and phenomena related to the formation , chemical and dynamical evolution of each cluster .",
    "+ the necessity of at least a third parameter transpires also from d10 and g10 analyses , in the form of either the luminosity cluster density or stellar density ( @xmath6 )  as already suggested by fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1993 )  which might correlate with the hot extension of the hbs , or a variation of the initial helium abundance ( y ) , respectively .",

    "as apparent from the upper panels of figure  [ m13m79 ] and [ m13m3 ] , once relative differences in reddening and distance are taken into account , the cmds match well at the to level and along the rgb , consistently with the fact that they have almost the same age and share a similar metallicity .",
    "+ in the bottom panels we focus on their turn off ( to ) region . also from a close inspection ,",
    "the cmds have been found to nicely overlap at the to and sgb region .",
    "this already rules out any significant age difference between m13 , m3 and m79 .",
    "however in order to perform a more accurate comparison , we also used two isochrones of proper metallicity and different age from the basti database ( pietrinferni et al .",

    "an age difference of @xmath37 gyr would be clearly visible and detectable .",
    "we then conclude that m13 , m3 and m79 differ in age by less than @xmath38 gyr .",

    "we have shown that m3 , m13 and m79 have similar metallicities and are coeval within typical uncertainties . therefore in this case , the scenario proposed by g10 and d10 , identifying the _ second parameter _ with age , is not applicable .",

    "we have considered theoretical models for [ fe / h ] = @xmath431.62 , which is the closest value available in the basti database to the clusters spectroscopically determined [ fe / h ] .    in our analysis",
    "we take advantage of all initial he - abundances available in the basti database , i.e. y=0.246 , 0.300 , 0.350 and 0.400 .",

    "( 2011 ) , the general trend being that the bluer hb stars are on average more na - rich and o - poor . as a consequence of these empirical results , we verified by performing a number of tests ( see appendix a ) how adequate is the use of standard @xmath42-enhanced spectra to determine bolometric corrections in this temperature regime .",
    "we found that results obtained by using standard @xmath42-enhanced bolometric corrections , are unaffected by the presence of the observed cnona anti - correlations .    regarding the effect of radiative levitation , spectroscopic investigations by behr  ( 2003 ) , moehler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , fabbian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have disclosed that - similar to the case of ngc2808 - in these three clusters hb stars hotter than @xmath4512000  k display surface abundances of metal species like fe , cr and ti around solar or higher , due to radiative levitation in the atmosphere . also , the surface he abundances are depleted by a factor of ten or more as a consequence of gravitational settling . following the approach used in paper  i",
    ", we mimic this effect using standard @xmath42-enhanced hb stellar models by applying bolometric corrections appropriate for [ fe / h]=0.0 ( and scaled - solar mixture ) when @xmath44 is above 12000  k. this is of course a crude approximation , which we are forced to adopt because of the lack of extended grids of both hb stellar evolution and atmosphere models with a large range of chemical compositions , that include consistently the effect of radiative levitation .",
    "the underlying assumptions are that _",
    "( i ) _ the hb model evolutionary lifetimes , _ ( ii ) _ the evolution of @xmath44 and _ ( iii ) _ bolometric luminosity , and _",
    "( iv ) _ the structure of the corresponding model atmospheres are not affected by the radiative levitation , and that the relevant bolometric corrections are determined mainly by the enhanced metals . with these assumptions",
    "the effect of radiative levitation on bolometric corrections makes @xmath12 fainter by about 0.15 and @xmath14 and @xmath46 brighter by about 0.1 and 0.05 respectively .",
    "paper  i has shown how this approximation allowed us to recover the three different he - abundances inferred by the multimodal ms , along the blue hb of ngc2808 .",
    "we are therefore confident that a similar procedure will be adequate to constrain the he distribution along the hb of these three clusters , that we are going to discuss separately in the following section .",
    "the theoretical analysis performed in this paper is based on synthetic hb calculations , performed as described in paper  i. the analysis of ngc2808 was simplified by the fact that the initial he content of the cluster subpopulations is somewhat quantized , as shown by the observed trimodal ms ( piotto et al .",
    "in case of m13 , m3 and m79 there is no apparent quantization of the ms , and we need to consider the possibility of a continuous distribution of y along the hb .",
    "+ we stress here that in these cases the modeling of the y variations along the hb becomes more uncertain since calculations require more assumptions .",
    "therefore the main goal of this work is not to attempt an exact description of the y distribution , that would be affected by our assumptions , but to understand whether helium plays a role in shaping these very different hbs .",
    "uv filters are much better suited than optical ones to address this issue .",
    "our synthetic hb calculations require the specification of at least 4 parameters , plus the cluster age , that we assume to be equal to 12  gyr ( see section 3 ) .",
    "these four parameters are the minimum value of y ( @xmath47 ) , the range of he abundances ( @xmath48 ) , the mean value of the mass lost along the rgb @xmath49  that in first instance ( and for simplicity ) we assume to be the same for each y  and the spread around this mean value ( @xmath50 ) . throughout our analysis",
    "we will assume that y varies according to either a uniform probability distribution , from @xmath47 to @xmath51 , or a gaussian one . in this latter case",
    "@xmath48 is the 1@xmath52 spread around a prescribed mean value . also for the rgb total mass loss we will assume a gaussian distribution around the mean value @xmath49 or a uniform distribution with minimum value equal to @xmath49",
    "the idea behind this type of simulations ( see , e.g. , caloi & dantona  2005 ) is that the colour extension of the hb is driven mainly by the variation of y rather than mass loss efficiency .",
    "a higher initial y implies a lower mass at the tip of the rgb ( for a fixed cluster age ) hence , for a fixed value of @xmath49 , a smaller mass along the hb and a bluer colour ( the he - core mass is affected by the variation of y to a smaller extent ) .",
    "our synthetic hb code first draws randomly a value of y , and determines the initial mass of the star at the rgb tip ( @xmath53 ) from interpolation among the basti isochrones of the prescribed age .",
    "the mass of the corresponding object evolving along the hb ( @xmath54 ) is then given by @xmath55 plus a gaussian random perturbation @xmath50 ( or a uniform probability between @xmath49 and @xmath49+@xmath50 ) .",
    "the wfpc2 magnitudes of the synthetic star are then determined according to its position along the hb track with appropriate mass and y obtained by interpolation among the available set of hb tracks  after an evolutionary time t has been randomly extracted .",
    "we determined t assuming that stars reach the zahb at a constant rate .",
    "we employed a flat probability distribution ranging from zero to @xmath56 , where @xmath56 denotes the time spent from the zahb to the he - burning shell ignition along the early agb .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is set by the mass with the longest lifetime ( the lowest masses for a given y and z ) .",
    "this implies that for some synthetic object the randomly selected value of t will be longer than its @xmath56 or , in other words , that they have already evolved to the next evolutionary stages .",
    "finally , the derived synthetic magnitudes are perturbed with a gaussian 1@xmath52 error determined from the data reduction procedure .",
    "we detail now the effects on these results of possible variations of age and chemical composition within the uncertainties described in section  3 . the mass distribution along the hb ( as derived in our analysis )",
    "does not depend on the cluster age , but changing the cluster age changes the mass loss necessary to reproduce the hb mass distribution .",
    "an increase of age of @xmath57 gyr leads to a decrease of the total mass loss along the rgb by @xmath58 ( because of the decreased evolving mass ) .",
    "+ one can simulate the effect of a variation of [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath42/fe ] and/or their sum by considering that at these metallicities scaled solar and @xmath42-enhanced models ( also for the hb ) with the same total global metallicity [ m / h ] are coincident ( salaris et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we have therefore considered a change @xmath59=+0.3 $ ] dex that corresponds to changes of [ fe / h ] or [ @xmath42/fe ] or [ fe / h]+[@xmath42/fe ] .",
    "we have two effects here .",
    "the first one is on the derived mass distribution ( at fixed y ) along the hb . for the redder part of the hb we use the ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) colour . at fixed colour in the horizontal part of the ( @xmath60 ) cmd , an increase @xmath24[m / h]=0.3 decreases the derived value of @xmath54 by @xmath450.04 @xmath61 . for the blue tails we use the ( @xmath62 )",
    "fixed ( @xmath63 ) an increase @xmath24[m / h]=0.3 decreases the derived value of @xmath54 by @xmath64 @xmath61 .",
    "this means that if a larger mass loss is needed to explain the blue hb stars ( compared to the mass loss needed to explain the redder population ) , an increase of [ m / h ] tends to reduce this mass loss difference .",
    "the second effect is on the rgb mass ( hence on the absolute value of the rgb mass loss ) .",
    "an increase @xmath24[m / h]=0.3 causes an increase of @xmath65 by @xmath66 @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution of y along the observed hbs is basically unaffected by the precise age and [ m / h ] , because it is based on the variation of magnitude ( in @xmath14 and @xmath12 , depending on the star colour ) with y , a differential property that is unaffected by the exact model metallicity and age .",
    "in this section we will discuss separately the theoretical analysis of our three selected clusters .",
    "we stress again that allowing y to vary within individual clusters , increases the number of free parameters needed to match the observed hb star distribution in the cmd . leaving aside for a moment the open problem of the rgb mass loss ,",
    "the distribution of y among stars fed onto the hb will depend on the convolution of the unknown ( at least for these three clusters ) initial y distribution among ms stars , with the y - dependent evolutionary timescales along ms and rgb predicted by stellar models .",
    "as discussed before , in absence of constraints from the ms , we assumed here as a first order approximation either gaussian or uniform probability distribution for y among hb stars .",
    "as a consequence , the derived distribution of y and mass range ( at fixed y ) are most probably just a reasonable approximation to the real ones .",

    "it is also very important to notice that low - mass stellar evolution models calculated for this mixture turn out to be identical to models calculated with the standard @xmath42-enhanced metal distribution .    from the synthetic spectra we have calculated bolometric corrections to the f160bw , f336w and f555w filters used in our analysis , for both metal mixtures .",
    "only at @xmath1305600  k there is a difference for the f336w filter ( we did not consider the f160bw at this low temperature , because our photometry does not register cold hb stars in this passband ) that amounts however to only 0.03  mag ( cnona2 mixture stars appearing fainter ) .",
    "given the small value of this difference and the fact that such extreme values of the anti - correlations appear not to be reached at such low temperatures along the hb , the outcome of our analysis of ngc2808 and the results of this paper , based on standard @xmath42-enhanced bolometric corrections , are unaffected by the presence of the observed cnona anti - correlations .",
    "we have explicitly determined also the effect of he variations ( at fixed metal content ) on the bolometric corrections .",
    "we considered the point with ( 7000  k , 2.80 ) ",
    "i.e. around the blue edge of the rr lyrae instability strip  and calculated spectra for our standard @xmath42-enhanced metal distribution , with y=0.35 . compared to the case with standard y=0.246 , both f336w and f555w bolometric corrections are changed by less than 0.01  mag .",

    "first of all , the range of y derived from our simulations is about twice the value determined by catelan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) from a comparison of theoretical zahb magnitudes and gravities with both strmgren photometry , and spectroscopically measured surface gravities and @xmath131 .",
    "the size of the sample with spectroscopic gravities and @xmath131 estimates is relatively small , and within the corresponding error bars models with @xmath132 can not be easily ruled out .",
    "more compelling seems to be the constraint from the strmgren cmds .",
    "a fit of theoretical zahb models to the magnitude ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) of the lower envelope of the observed hb at both the red side of the instability strip and at the knee of the stellar distribution beyond the blue edge of the strip , before the sparsely populated and not very extended blue vertical tail  where zahbs of different y tend to become degenerate  discloses a range of y at most equal to @xmath24y@xmath450.01 , with y increasing at the blue side of the strip .",
    "this disagreement with our results is however only apparent , for it can be very easily explained by recalling that to any given @xmath0 value corresponds it is associated a dispersion in colour along the hb ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "figure  [ synthm3_4 ] illustrates clearly this point by comparing a theoretical zahb for y=0.256 and @xmath44 larger than the blue edge of the instability strip  shifted by our derived distance modulus and assumed reddening  to the observed data .",
    "notice how for ( @xmath136 ) , that corresponds to the region of the knee in the strmgren cmds , this zahb fits nicely the observed lower envelope of the cmd , even though the average y in that colour range inferred by the best - fit synthetic model , is 0.260 .",
    "given the existence of a range of hb masses at fixed y , this colour interval is also populated by stars with y as low as @xmath450.255 , that are on average the faintest objects and hence determine the observed lower envelope of the magnitude distribution .",
    "the second issue is related to the cluster rich rrlyrae population .",
    "the period distribution of fundamental rrlyrae is strongly peaked , and in the recent literature attempts have been made to reproduce both the peaked period distribution and the hb colour extension .",
    "castellani , castellani , & cassisi  ( 2005 ) have shown that when keeping y constant , a suitable bimodal mass distribution with two different mass dispersions is able to reproduce the observed features . on the other hand , dantona & caloi  ( 2008 ) assumed a range of y and a very small mass dispersion for the mass loss along the rgb , and reproduced the observed hb colour extension and rrlyrae periods by calibrating the y distribution ( instead of the hb mass distribution ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that dantona & caloi  ( 2008 ) find from their simulations that 90% of hb stars are expected to have y@xmath1370.265 , in agreement with our results , and only 10% of objects in their simulations reach y values above our estimated maximum y.    here we have considered the synthetic objects in the best fit simulations that fall within the boundary of the instability strip ( using the same @xmath44 boundaries employed by dantona & caloi  2008 ) and were excluded from the comparison with the observed cmd .",

    "open symbols denote synthetic objects with y@xmath1380.270 .",
    "the zahb sequences for y=0.246 and y=0.300 are also displayed .",
    "the rectangular box marks the region considered in the comparison ( see text for details).,width=317 ]    as a test , we have calculated additional synthetic hb models for m3 , employing this time the @xmath139 y distribution proposed by dantona & caloi  ( 2008  see their figure  4 ) to reproduce both the observed period distribution in the instability strip and the @xmath140 colour distribution along the hb , while keeping the same mass loss for all hb stars . as in dantona & caloi  ( 2008 )",
    "we employed a gaussian mass distribution ; our adopted mean mass loss is @xmath49=0.160@xmath67 with a small ( as discussed in dantona & caloi 2008 ) gaussian spread @xmath50=0.002@xmath67 , and employed the same reddening and distance modulus as in the previous simulations .",
    "these choices allow to reproduce well the narrow period distribution ( both mean value of the logarithm of the periods and the 1@xmath52 dispersion ) whereas a comparison of the the stellar distribution in the cmd at the blue side of the strip is less satisfactory .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  [ synthm3_5 ] show the observed and simulated ( @xmath71 ) cmd . notice how the observed shape of the cmd is reasonably reproduced as long as y is below @xmath450.270 . for higher values of y ,",
    "synthetic stars tend to reach too bright magnitudes ( while in the @xmath141 plane they tend to be located along the more vertical blue part of the hb , at / beyond the knee ) .",
    "this reinforces our estimate of the y range as determined by our previous set of simulations  that is the main purpose of our analysis  and the need to increase the mass loss spread at the blue side of the instability strip  instead of y  in order to match the cmd location of the bluer objects ."
