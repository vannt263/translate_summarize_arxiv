    "in nature there are few known processes that allow the production of black holes .",
    "the best well - known is the gravitational collapse of a massive star or cluster of stars . due to fermionic degeneracy pressure these black holes",
    "can not have a mass below the oppenheimer - volkoff limiting mass ( @xmath2 in recent calculations ) .",
    "another one is the quantum schwinger - like process of black hole pair creation in an external field .",
    "these black holes can have planck dimensions and thus their evolution is ruled by quantum effects .",
    "moreover , gravitational pair creation involves topology changing processes , and allows a study of the statistical properties of black holes , namely : it favors the conjecture that the number of internal microstates of a black hole is given by the exponential of one - quarter of the area of the black hole horizon , and it gives useful clues to the black hole information paradox .",
    "the evaluation of the black hole pair creation rate has been done at the semiclassical level using the instanton method .",
    "an instanton is an euclidean solution that interpolates between the initial and final states of a classically forbidden transition , and is a saddle point for the euclidean path integral that describes the pair creation rate .",
    "this instanton method has been first introduced in studies about decay of metastable termodynamical states , and it has been applied in the context of pair creation of particles and fields in the absence of gravity , by several authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .      the instanton method has been also introduced as a framework for quantum gravity , with successful results in the analysis of gravitational thermodynamic issues and black hole pair production processes , among others ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the regular instantons that describe the process we are interested in - the pair creation of black holes in an external field - can be obtained by analytically continuing ( i ) a solution found by ernst @xcite , ( ii ) the de sitter black hole solutions , ( iii ) a solution found by kinnersley and walker known as the c - metric @xcite , ( iv ) a combination of the above solutions , or ( v ) the domain wall solution @xcite .",
    "to each one of these five families of instantons corresponds a different way by which energy can be furnished in order to materialize the pair of black holes and to accelerate them apart . in case ( i )",
    "the energy is provided by the electromagnetic lorentz force , in case ( ii ) the strings tension furnishes this energy , in case ( iii ) the energy is provided by the rapid cosmological expansion associated to the positive cosmological constant @xmath3 , in case ( iv ) the energy is provided by a combination of the above fields , and finally in case ( v ) the energy is given by the repulsive gravitational field of the domain wall .",
    "since these solutions play a fundamental role , we will now briefly discuss some of them that are less known .",
    "the c - metric @xcite describes a pair of black holes ( neutral or charged ) uniformly accelerating in opposite directions .",
    "the solution has conical singularities at its angular poles that , when conveniently treated , can be interpreted as two strings from each one of the black holes towards the infinity and whose tension provides the necessary force to pull apart the black holes . by appending a suitable external electromagnetic field ,",
    "ernst @xcite has removed all the conical singularities of the charged flat c - metric .",
    "the ernst solution then describes two oppositely charged black holes undergoing uniform acceleration provided by the lorentz force associated to the external field ( for the magnetic solution see @xcite , while the explicit electric solution can be found in brown @xcite ) .",
    "asymptotically , the ernst solution reduces to the melvin universe @xcite .",
    "the lorentz sector of the c - metric and ernst solution describe the evolution of the black holes after their creation .",
    "the usual de sitter black hole solutions , when euclideanized , give also instantons for pair creation of black holes .",
    "indeed , the de sitter black holes solutions can be interpreted as representing a black hole pair being accelerated by the cosmological constant .",
    "it was believed that the only black hole pairs that could be nucleated were those whose euclidean sector was free of conical singularities ( instantons ) .",
    "this regularity condition restricted the mass and charge of the black holes that could be produced , and physically it meant that the only black holes that could be pair produced were those that are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "however , wu @xcite , and bousso and hawking @xcite have shown that euclidean solutions with conical singularities ( sub - maximal instantons ) may also be used as saddle points for the pair creation process , as long as the spacelike boundary of the manifold is chosen in order to contain the conical singularity and the metric is specified there . in this way ,",
    "pair creation of black holes whose horizons are not in thermodynamic equilibrium is also allowed .",
    "we will describe the studies that have been done on pair creation of black holes in an external field .",
    "\\(i ) the suggestion that the pair creation of black holes could occur in quantized einstein - maxwell theory has been given by gibbons @xcite in 1986 , who has proposed that extremal black holes could be produced in a background magnetic field and that the appropriate instanton describing the process could be obtained by euclideanizing the extremal ernst solution .",
    "this idea has been recovered by giddings and garfinkle @xcite that confirmed the expectation of @xcite and , in addition , they have constructed an ernst instanton that describes pair creation of nonextreme black holes .",
    "the explicit calculation of the rate for this last process has lead garfinkle , giddings and strominger @xcite to conclude that the pair creation rate of nonextreme black holes is enhanced relative to the pair creation of monopoles and extreme black holes by a factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hawking - bekenstein entropy of the black hole and @xmath6 is the area of the black hole event horizon .",
    "this issue of black hole pair creation in a background magnetic field and the above relation between the pair creation rate and the entropy has been further investigated by dowker , gauntlett , kastor and traschen @xcite , by dowker , gauntlett , giddings and horowitz @xcite , and by ross @xcite , but now in the context of the low energy limit of string theory and in the context of five - dimensional kaluza - klein theory . to achieve their aim",
    "they have worked with an effective dilaton theory which , for particular values of the dilaton parameter , reduces to the above theories , and they have explicitly constructed the dilaton ernst instantons that describe the process .",
    "the one - loop contribution to the magnetic black hole pair creation problem has been given by yi @xcite .",
    "brown @xcite has analyzed the pair creation of charged black holes in an electric external field . hawking , horowitz and ross @xcite ( see also hawking and horowitz @xcite )",
    "have related the rate of pair creation of extreme black holes with the area of the acceleration horizon . in the nonextreme case , the rate has an additional contribution from the area of the black hole horizon .",
    "from these relations emerges an explanation for the fact , mentioned above , that the pair creation rate of nonextreme black holes is enhanced relative to the pair creation of extremal black holes by precisely the factor @xmath7 . for a detailed discussion concerning the reason why this factor involves only @xmath6 and not two times this value see also emparan @xcite .",
    "it has to do with the fact that the internal microstates of two members of the black hole pair are correlated .",
    "\\(ii ) the study of pair creation of de sitter ( ds ) black holes has been also investigated .",
    "notice that the ds black hole solution can be interpreted as a pair of ds black holes that are being accelerated apart by the positive cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological horizon can be seen as an acceleration horizon that impedes the causal contact between the two black holes , and this analogy is perfectly identified for example when we compare the carter - penrose diagrams of the c - metric and of the ds schwarzschild black hole , for example .",
    "the study on pair creation of black holes in a ds background has begun in 1989 by mellor and moss @xcite , who have identified the gravitational instantons that describe the process ( see also romans @xcite for a detailed construction of these instantons ) .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the pair creation rates of neutral and charged black holes accelerated by a cosmological constant has been done by mann and ross @xcite .",
    "this process has also been discussed in the context of the inflationary era undergone by the universe by bousso and hawking @xcite .",
    "garattini @xcite , and volkov and wipf @xcite have computed the one - loop factor for this pair creation process , something that in gravity quantum level is not an easy task .",
    "booth and mann @xcite have analyzed the cosmological pair production of charged and rotating black holes .",
    "pair creation of dilaton black holes in a ds background has also been discussed by bousso @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in 1995 , hawking and ross @xcite and eardley , horowitz , kastor and traschen @xcite have discussed a process in which a cosmic string breaks and a pair of black holes is produced at the ends of the string .",
    "the string tension then pulls the black holes away , and the c - metric provides the appropriate instantons to describe their creation . in order to ensure that this process is physically consistent achcarro , gregory and kuijken @xcite , and gregory and hindmarsh @xcite have shown that a conical singularity can be replaced by a nielson - olesen vortix .",
    "this vortix can then pierce a black hole @xcite , or end at it @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that even topologically stable strings can end at a black hole @xcite-@xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) we can also consider a pair creation process , analyzed by emparan @xcite , involving cosmic string breaking in a background magnetic field . in this case",
    "the lorentz force is in excess or in deficit relative to the net force necessary to furnish the right acceleration to the black holes , and this discrepancy is eliminated by the string tension .",
    "the instantons describing this process are a combination of the ernst and c - metric intantons .",
    "\\(v ) the gravitational repulsive energy of a domain wall provides another mechanism for black hole pair creation .",
    "this process has been analyzed by caldwell , chamblin and gibbons @xcite , and by bousso and chamblin @xcite in a flat background , while in an anti - de sitter background the pair creation of topological black holes ( with hyperbolic topology ) has been analyzed by mann @xcite .",
    "other studies concerning the process of pair creation in a generalized background is done in @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that oddly the pair creation of electric black holes was apparently enhanced relative to the pair creation of magnetic black holes .",
    "this was a consequence of the fact that the maxwell action has opposite signs in the two cases .",
    "now , this discrepancy between the two pair creation rates was not consistent with the idea that electric and magnetic black holes should have identical quantum properties .",
    "this issue has been properly and definitively clarified by hawking and ross @xcite and by brown @xcite , who have shown that the magnetic and electric solutions differ not only in their actions , but also in the nature of the boundaries conditions that can be imposed on them .",
    "more precisely , one can impose the magnetic charge as a boundary condition at infinity but , in the electric case , one instead imposes the chemical potential as a boundary condition . as a consequence they proposed that the electric action should contain an extra maxwell boundary term .",
    "this term cancels the opposite signs of the maxwell action , and the pair creation rate of magnetic and electric black holes is equal .",
    "the process of black hole pair creation gives also useful clues to the discussion of the black hole information loss problem @xcite .",
    "due to the thermal hawking radiation the black holes evaporate .",
    "this process implies that one of the following three scenarios occurs ( see @xcite for reviews ) : ( i ) the information previously swallowed to the black hole is destroyed , ( ii ) this information is recovered to the exterior through the hawking radiation , or ( iii ) the endpoint of the evaporation is a plank scale remnant which stores the information .",
    "there are serious difficulties associated to each one of this scenarios .",
    "scenario ( i ) implies non - unitarity and violation of energy conservation , scenario ( ii ) implies violation of locality and causality , and the main problem with scenario ( iii ) is that a huge energy is needed in order to store all the information that has been swallowed by the black hole , and a planck scale remnant has very little energy .",
    "pair creation of black holes has been used to test these scenarios .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite that if one demands preservation of unitarity and of locality then a careful analysis of the one - loop contribution to the pair creation process indicates that the hawking process would leave behind a catastrophic infinite number of remnants .",
    "so the remnant hypothesis seems to be discarded , although some escape solutions can be launched @xcite . on the other side , hawking , horowitz and ross @xcite have called attention to the fact that the same instantons that describe pair creation can , when reversed in time , describe their pair annihilation , as long as the black holes have appropriate initial conditions such that they come to rest at the right critical separation ( this annihilation process was also discussed by emparan @xcite ) .",
    "one can then construct @xcite an argument that favors the information loss scenario : black holes previously produced as a particle - antiparticle pair can accrete information and annihilate , with their energy being given off as electromagnetic and gravitational radiation .",
    "therefore , the information loss scenario seems to occur at least in this annihilation process .      an important process that accompanies the production of the black hole pair and the subsequent acceleration that they suffer is the emission of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation . in an asymptotically flat background ,",
    "an estimate for the amount of gravitational radiation radiated during the pair creation period has been given by cardoso , dias and lemos @xcite : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass of each one of the created black holes and @xmath11 is the lorentz factor .",
    "this value can lead , under appropriate numbers of @xmath10 and @xmath12 to huge quantities , and is a very good candidate to emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "for example , for black holes with 30 times the planck mass and with @xmath13 of the velocity of light , the gravitational energy released is @xmath14 , which is about 100 times the rest energy of the pair .",
    "the gravitational radiative properties of the resulting accelerated black holes has been analyzed by bik , and pravda and pravdova @xcite . in a ds background ,",
    "the gravitational radiation emitted by uniformly accelerated sources without horizons has been analyzed by bik and krtou @xcite , and the radiative properties of accelerated black holes have been studied by krtou and podolsk ' y @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we discuss the process in which a cosmic string nucleates in a de sitter ( ds ) background , and then breaks producing a pair of black holes at its ends . therefore , the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the positive cosmological constant and , in addition , from the string tension .",
    "this process is a combination of the processes considered in ( ii ) @xcite-@xcite and in ( iii ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the instantons for this process can be constructed by analytically continuing the ds c - metric found by plebaski and demiaski @xcite and analyzed by podolsk and griffiths @xcite , and in detail by dias and lemos @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : instanton - method ] , we describe the semiclassical instanton method used to evaluate the pair creation rate . in section [ sec : ds c - inst ] we construct , from the ds c - metric , the instantons that describe the pair creation process . then , in section [ sec : calc - i ] , we explicitly evaluate the pair creation rate for each one of the cases discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ds c - inst ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entropy ] we verify that the usual relation between pair creation rate , entropy and total area holds also for the pair creation process discussed in this paper . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] concluding remarks are presented . in the appendix",
    "a heuristic derivation of the pair creation rates is given . throughout this paper",
    "we use units in which @xmath15 .",
    "the pair creation of black holes in a de sitter ( ds ) background is described , according to the no - boundary proposal of hartle and hawking @xcite , by the propagation from nothing to a 3-surface boundary @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude for this process is given by the wave function @xmath17d[a_{\\mu}]e^{-i(g_{\\mu\\nu},a_{\\mu})}\\ : ,   \\label{wave }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the induced metric and electromagnetic potential on the boundary @xmath20 of a compact manifold @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] is a measure on the space of the metrics @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] is a measure on the space of the maxwell field @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is their euclidean action .",
    "the path integral is over all compact metrics and potentials on manifolds @xmath21 with boundary @xmath16 , which agree with the boundary data on @xmath16 . for a detailed discussion of the no - boundary proposal applied to the study of black hole pair creation see bousso and chamblin @xcite .    in the semiclassical instanton approximation ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the path integral comes from metrics and maxwell fields which are near the solutions ( instantons ) that extremalize the euclidean action and satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "thus , considering small fluctuations around this solution , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the action expands as @xmath29 where @xmath30 are quadratic in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and dots denote higher order terms .",
    "the wave function , that describes the creation of a black hole pair from nothing , is then given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the classical action of the gravitational instanton that mediates the pair creation of black holes , and the prefactor @xmath35 is the one loop contribution from the quantum quadratic fluctuations in the fields , @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the wave function that describes the nucleation of a ds space with a string from nothing is @xmath36 , and the wave function describing the nucleation of a ds space from nothing is @xmath37 .",
    "the nucleation probability of the ds space from nothing , of the ds space with a string from nothing , and of a space with a pair of black holes from nothing is then given by @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "we may now ask four questions : what is the probability for ( i ) pair creation of black holes in a ds spacetime , ( ii ) the nucleation of a string in a ds background , ( iii ) the process in which a string in a ds background breaks and a pair of black holes is created , and ( iv ) the combined process ( ii)+(iii ) . in the process ( i ) the energy to materialize the pair comes only from the positive cosmological constant background , @xmath3 .",
    "the system does not contain a string and the probability for this process has been found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute explicitly the probability for processes ( ii)-(iv ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the process ( iii ) , one assumes that the initial background contains a string , i.e. , the question that is being asked is : given that the string is already present in our initial system , what is the probability that it breaks and a pair of black holes is produced and accelerated apart by @xmath3 and by the string tension ?",
    "on the other side , in ( iv ) one is asking : starting from a pure ds background , what is the probability that a string nucleates on it and then breaks forming a pair of black holes ? naturally , the probability for process ( iv ) is the product of the probability for process ( ii ) and the probability for process ( iii ) .    according to the no - boundary proposal ,",
    "the nucleation rate of a string in a ds background is proportional to @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 the pair creation rate of black holes when a string breaks in a ds background is given by @xmath43 and the pair creation rate of black holes when process ( iv ) occurs is given by the product of ( [ pc - rate - string ] ) and ( [ pc - rate - breakstring ] ) , i.e. , @xmath44 in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc - i ] we will find @xmath34 and @xmath45 . in the three relations above , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are one - loop prefactors which will not be considered in this paper .",
    "the evaluation of this one - loop prefactor has been done only in a small number of cases , namely for the vacuum background by gibbons , hawking and perry @xcite , for the schwarzschild instanton by gross , perry and yaffe @xcite , for other asymptotically flat instantons by young @xcite , for the ds background by gibbons and perry @xcite and christensen and duff @xcite , for the ds - schwarzschild instanton by ginsparg and perry @xcite , young @xcite , volkov and wipf @xcite and garattinni @xcite , and for the ernst instanton by yi @xcite .    at this point",
    "we must specify the euclidean action needed to compute the path integral ( [ wave ] ) .",
    "this issue was analyzed and clarified in detail by hawking and ross @xcite and by brown @xcite .",
    "now , due to its relevance for the present paper , we briefly discuss the main results of @xcite .",
    "one wants to use an action for which it is natural to fix the boundary data on @xmath16 specified in ( [ wave ] ) .",
    "that is , one wants to use an action whose variation gives the euclidean equations of motion when the variation fixes these boundary data on @xmath16 @xcite . in the magnetic case",
    "this euclidean action is the einstein - maxwell action with a positive cosmological constant @xmath3 given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the determinant of the euclidean metric , @xmath51 is the determinant of the induced metric on the boundary @xmath16 , @xmath52 is the ricci scalar , @xmath53 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath54 of the boundary , and @xmath55 is the maxwell field strength of the gauge field @xmath56 .",
    "variation of ( [ i ] ) yields @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents terms giving the equations of motion plus gravitational boundary terms that are discussed in @xcite , and @xmath59 is the unit outward normal to @xmath16 .",
    "thus , variation of ( [ i ] ) gives the equations of motion as long as it is at fixed gauge potential @xmath60 on the boundary .",
    "now , for magnetic black hole solutions , fixing the potential fixes the charge on each of the black holes , since the magnetic charge is just given by the integral of @xmath61 over a 2-sphere lying in the boundary . however , in the electric case , fixing @xmath60 can be regarded as fixing a chemical potential @xmath62 which is conjugate to the charge @xcite .",
    "holding the electric charge fixed is equivalent to fixing @xmath63 on @xmath16 , as the electric charge is given by the integral of the dual of @xmath64 over a 2-sphere lying in @xmath16 .",
    "therefore in the electric case the appropriate euclidean action is @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is defined in ( [ i ] ) .",
    "variation of action ( [ i - electric ] ) yields @xmath67 , and thus it gives the equations of motion when @xmath68 , and so the electric charge , is held fixed . since @xmath69 has opposite signs for dual magnetic and electric solutions , if we took ( [ i ] ) to evaluate both the magnetic and electric actions we would conclude that the pair creation of electric black holes would be enhanced relative to the pair creation of magnetic black holes .",
    "this physically unexpected result does not occur when one considers the appropriate boundary conditions and includes the extra maxwell boundary term in ( [ i - electric ] ) .",
    "we have to be careful @xcite when computing the extra maxwell boundary term in the electric action ( [ i - electric ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have to find a vector potential , @xmath56 , that is regular everywhere in the instanton , including at the horizons .",
    "usually , as we shall see , this requirement leads to unusual choices for @xmath56 .",
    "the need of this requirement is easily understood if we take the example of the electric reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite . in this case , normally , the gauge potential in schwarzschild coordinates is taken to be @xmath70 . however , this potential is not regular at the horizon @xmath71 , since @xmath72 diverges there .",
    "an appropriate choice that yields a regular electromagnetic potential everywhere , including at the horizon is @xmath73 or , alternatively , @xmath74 .",
    "to all these potentials corresponds the field strength @xmath75 .",
    "the ds c - metric has been found by plebaski and demiaski @xcite . the physical properties and interpretation of this solution",
    "have been analyzed by podolsk and griffiths @xcite , and in detail by dias and lemos @xcite .",
    "the ds c - metric describes a pair of uniformly accelerated black holes in a ds background , with the acceleration being provided by the cosmological constant and , in addition , by a string that connects the two black holes along their south poles and pulls them away .",
    "the presence of the string is associated to the conical singularity that exists in the south pole of the ds c - metric ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for a detailed discussion on the properties of the ds c - metric we ask the reader to see @xcite . here",
    "we will only mention those which are really essential .",
    "following sec .",
    "[ sec : instanton - method ] , in order to evaluate the black hole pair creation rate we need to find the instantons of the theory , i.e. , we must look into the euclidean section of the ds c - metric and choose only those euclidean solutions which are regular in a way that will be explained soon . to obtain the euclidean section of the ds c - metric from the lorentzian ds c - metric we simply introduce an imaginary time coordinate @xmath76 .",
    "then the gravitational field of the euclidean ds c - metric is given by ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath77^{-2 } ( { \\cal f}d\\tau^2 +   { \\cal f}^{-1}dy^2+{\\cal g}^{-1}dx^2 +   { \\cal g}d\\phi^2)\\ : ,   \\label{c - metric pcds}\\ ] ] @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cosmological constant , @xmath80 is the acceleration of the black holes , and @xmath10 and @xmath81 are the adm mass and electromagnetic charge of the non - accelerated black hole , respectively .",
    "the maxwell field in the magnetic case is given by @xmath82 while in the electric case it is given by @xmath83 the solution has a curvature singularity at @xmath84 where the matter source is .",
    "the point @xmath85 corresponds to a point that is infinitely far away from the curvature singularity , thus as @xmath86 increases we approach the curvature singularity and @xmath87 is the inverse of a radial coordinate . at most ,",
    "@xmath88 can have four real zeros which we label in ascending order by @xmath89 .",
    "the roots @xmath90 and @xmath91 are respectively the inner and outer charged black hole horizons , and @xmath92 is an acceleration horizon which coincides with the cosmological horizon and has a non - spherical shape .",
    "the negative root @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94 and thus has no physical significance .",
    "the angular coordinate @xmath95 belongs to the range @xmath96 $ ] for which @xmath97 ( when we set @xmath98 we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) . in order to avoid a conical singularity in the north pole ,",
    "the period of @xmath101 must be given by @xmath102 and this leaves a conical singularity in the south pole with deficit angle @xmath103 that signals the presence of a string with mass density @xmath104 , and with pressure @xmath105 . when we set the acceleration parameter @xmath106 equal to zero , the ds c - metric reduces to the usual ds@xmath107reissner - nordstrm or ds - schwarzschild solutions without conical singularities .",
    "so far , we have described the solution that represents a pair of black holes accelerated by the cosmological constant and by the string tension .",
    "this solution describes the evolution of the black hole pair after its creation .",
    "now , we want to find a solution that represents a string in a ds background . this solution will describe the initial system , before the breaking of the cosmic string that leads to the formation of the black hole pair . in order to achieve our aim",
    "we note that at spatial infinity the gravitational field of the euclidean ds c - metric reduces to @xmath108 ^ 2}{\\biggl [ }   \\left ( -\\frac{\\lambda}{3a_0^{\\,2}}-1+y^2 \\right ) dt^2",

    "@xmath109 is a constant that represents a freedom in the choice of coordinates , and @xmath110 .",
    "we want that this metric also describes the solution before the creation of the black hole pair , i.e. , we demand that it describes a string with its conical deficit in a ds background .",
    "now , if we want to maintain the intrinsic properties of the string during the process we must impose that its mass density and thus its conical deficit remains constant . after the pair creation we already know that the conical deficit is given by ( [ conic - sing - ds ] ) .",
    "hence , the requirement that the background solution describes a ds spacetime with a conical deficit angle given exactly by ( [ conic - sing - ds ] ) leads us to impose that in ( [ backg metric - ds ] ) one has @xmath111 the arbitrary parameter @xmath109 can be fixed by imposing a matching between ( [ c - metric pcds ] ) and ( [ backg metric - ds ] ) at large spatial distances @xcite , yielding @xmath112 ^ 2/\\left [ 2{\\cal g}''(x_\\mathrm{s } ) \\right ] $ ] .",
    "returning back to the euclidean ds c - metric ( [ c - metric pcds ] ) , in order to have a positive definite euclidean metric we must require that @xmath86 belongs to @xmath113 . in general , when @xmath114 , one has conical singularities at the horizons @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in order to obtain a regular solution we have to eliminate the conical singularities at both horizons .",
    "this is achieved by imposing that the period of @xmath117 is the same for the two horizons , and is equivalent to requiring that the hawking temperature of the two horizons be equal . to eliminate the conical singularity at @xmath115 the period of @xmath117",

    "we have studied in detail the quantum process in which a cosmic string breaks in a de sitter ( ds ) background and a pair of black holes is created at the ends of the string . the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the positive cosmological constant and from the string tension .",

    "we remark that in principle our explicit values for the pair creation rates also apply to the process of pair creation in an external electromagnetic field , with the acceleration being provided in this case by the lorentz force instead of being furnished by the string tension .",
    "indeed , there is no ds ernst solution , and thus we can not discuss analytically the process .",
    "however , physically we could in principle consider an external electromagnetic field that supplies the same energy and acceleration as our strings and , from the results of the @xmath266 case ( where the pair creation rates in the string and electromagnetic cases agree ) , we expect that the pair creation rates found in this paper do not depend on whether the energy is being provided by an external electromagnetic field or by a string .    we have constructed the saddle point solutions that mediate the pair creation process through the analytic continuation of the ds c - metric , and we have explicitly computed the nucleation rate of the process ( see also a heuristic derivation of the rate in the appendix ) .",
    "globally our results state that the ds space is stable against the nucleation of a string , or against the nucleation of a string followed by its breaking and consequent creation of a black hole pair .",
    "in particular , we have answered three questions .",
    "first , we have concluded that the nucleation rate of a cosmic string in a ds background @xmath438 decreases when the mass density of the string increases .",
    "second , given that the string is already present in our initial system , the probability @xmath439 that it breaks and a pair of black holes is produced and accelerated apart by @xmath3 and by the string tension increases when the mass density of the string increases .",
    "in other words , a string with a higher mass density makes the process more probable , for a fixed black hole mass .",
    "third , if we start with a pure ds background , the probability @xmath440 that a string nucleates on it and then breaks forming a pair of black holes decreases when the mass density of the string increases .",
    "these processes have a clear analogy with a thermodynamical system , with the mass density of the string being the analogue of the temperature @xmath441 .",
    "indeed , from the boltzmann factor , @xmath442 ( where @xmath443 is the boltzmann constant ) , one knows that a higher background temperature turns the nucleation of a particle with energy @xmath444 more probable .",
    "however , in order to have a higher temperature we have first to furnish more energy to the background , and thus the global process ( increasing the temperature to the final value @xmath441 plus the nucleation of the particle ) becomes energetically less favorable as @xmath441 increases .",
    "we have also verified that the relation between the rate , entropy and area , which is satisfied for all the black hole pair creation processes analyzed so far , also holds in the process studied in this paper .",
    "indeed , the pair creation rate is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the gravitational entropy of the system , and is given by one quarter of the total area of all the horizons present in the saddle point solution that mediates the pair creation .    to conclude",
    "let us recall that the ds c - metric allows two distinct physical interpretations . in one of them one removes the conical singularity at the north pole and leaves one at the south pole .",
    "in this way the ds c - metric describes a pair of black holes accelerated away by a string with positive mass density .",
    "alternatively , we can avoid the conical singularity at the south pole and in this case the black holes are pushed away by a strut ( with negative mass density ) in between them , along their north poles . in this paper",
    "we have adopted the first choice .",
    "technically , the second choice only changes the period of the angular coordinate @xmath101 : it would be given by @xmath445 instead of ( [ period phi ] ) .",
    "we have chosen the first choice essentially for two reasons .",
    "first , the string has a positive mass density and , in this sense , it is a more physical solution than the strut .",
    "second , in order to get the above string / pair configuration we only have to cut the string in a point .",
    "the string tension does the rest of the work .",

    "the force can then be written as @xmath456 , where the characteristic mass of the system is @xmath457 .",
    "thus , the characteristic work is @xmath458 , where the characteristic distance that separates the pair at the creation moment is @xmath455 .",
    "so , from the boltzmann factor we indeed expect that the creation rate of a black hole pair in a ds background is given by @xmath448 @xcite .",
    "a question that has been answered in the present paper was : given that a string is already present in our initial system , what is the probability that it breaks and a pair of black holes is produced and accelerated apart by @xmath3 and by the string tension ?",
    "the presence of the string leads in practice to a problem in which we have an effective cosmological constant that satisfies @xmath459 , that is , the acceleration @xmath106 provided by the string makes a positive contribution to the process .",
    "heuristically , we may then apply the same arguments that have been used in the last paragraph , with the replacement @xmath460 . at the end ,",
    "the boltzmann factor tells us that the creation rate for the process is @xmath461 .",
    "so , for a given black hole mass , @xmath10 , and for a given cosmological constant , @xmath3 , the black hole pair creation process is enhanced when a string is present , as the explicit calculations done in the main body of the paper show . for @xmath266 this heuristic derivation yields @xmath462 which is the pair creation rate found in @xcite .",
    "another question that we have dealt with in the present paper was : what is the probability for the nucleation of a string in a ds background ?",
    "heuristically , the energy of the string that nucleates is @xmath463 , i.e. , its mass per unit length times the ds radius , while the work provided by the cosmological background is still given by @xmath450 .",
    "the boltzmann factor yields for nucleation rate the value @xmath464 , in agreement with ( [ pc - rate - stringend ] ) .",

    "<S> we analyze the quantum process in which a cosmic string breaks in a de sitter ( ds ) background , and a pair of neutral or charged black holes is produced at the ends of the string . the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the positive cosmological constant and , in addition , from the string tension . </S>",
    "<S> the compact saddle point solutions without conical singularities ( instantons ) or with conical singularities ( sub - maximal instantons ) that describe this process are constructed through the analytical continuation of the ds c - metric . </S>",
    "<S> then , we explicitly compute the pair creation rate of the process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find the nucleation rate of a cosmic string in a ds background , and the probability that it breaks and a pair of black holes is produced . </S>",
    "<S> finally we verify that , as occurs with pair production processes in other background fields , the pair creation rate of black holes is proportional to @xmath0 , where the gravitational entropy of the black hole , @xmath1 , is given by one quarter of the area of the horizons present in the saddle point solution that mediates the process . </S>"
