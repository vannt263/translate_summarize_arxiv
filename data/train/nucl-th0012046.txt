    "the determination of the quadrupole excitation strength @xmath7 in the region of the @xmath8 resonance has been the aim of considerable experimental and theoretical activities . within the harmonic oscillator quark model ,",
    "the @xmath9 and the nucleon are both members of the symmetrical 56-plet of @xmath10 with orbital momentum @xmath11 , positive parity and a gaussian wave function in space . in this approximation the @xmath9 may only be excited by a magnetic dipole transition @xmath12 @xcite . however , in analogy with the atomic hyperfine interaction or the forces between nucleons , also the interactions between the quarks contain a tensor component due to the exchange of gluons .",
    "this hyperfine interaction admixes higher states to the nucleon and @xmath9 wave functions , in particular @xmath13-state components with @xmath14 , resulting in a small electric quadrupole transition @xmath7 between nucleon and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in addition quadrupole transitions are possible by mesonic and gluonic exchange currents @xcite .",
    "therefore an accurate measurement of @xmath7 is of great importance in testing the forces between the quarks and , quite generally , models of nucleons and isobars .    the e2/m1 ratio , @xmath15 has been predicted to be in the range @xmath16 in the framework of constituent quark @xcite , relativized quark @xcite and chiral bag models @xcite .",
    "considerably larger values have been obtained in skyrme models @xcite .",
    "a first lattice qcd calculation resulted in a small value with large error bars @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , the connection of the model calculations with the experimental data is not evident .",
    "clearly , the @xmath9 resonance is coupled to the pion - nucleon continuum and final - state interactions will lead to strong background terms seen in the experimental data , particularly in case of the small @xmath18 amplitude .",
    "the question of how to  correct  the experimental data to extract the properties of the resonance has been the topic of many theoretical investigations .",
    "unfortunately it turns out that the analysis of the small @xmath18 amplitude is quite sensitive to details of the models , e.g. nonrelativistic vs. relativistic resonance denominators , constant or energy - dependent widths and masses of the resonance , sizes of the form factor included in the width etc . in other words , by changing these definitions the meaning of resonance vs. background changes , too .    in order to study the @xmath9 deformation ,",
    "pion photoproduction on the proton has been measured by the legs collaboration @xcite at brookhaven and by the a2 collaboration @xcite at mainz using transversely polarized photons , i.e. by measuring the polarized photon asymmetry @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the cross section @xmath20 for photon polarization in the reaction plane turns out to be very sensitive to the small @xmath18 amplitude .",
    "assuming for simplicity that only the @xmath21-wave multipoles contribute , the differential cross section is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pion and photon momenta and @xmath25 is the pion emission angle in the @xmath26 frame . neglecting the ( small ) contributions of the roper multipole @xmath27 , one obtains @xcite @xmath28 because the isospin @xmath29 amplitudes strongly dominate the cross section for @xmath30 production .    in order to obtain the c2/m1 ratio and the form factors as functions of @xmath4",
    "pion electroproduction has been studied . at mainz ,",
    "bonn , bates and jlab different experiments have been performed , without polarization as well as single and double polarization .",
    "while the experiments at mainz and bates measured at @xmath31 gev@xmath5 in order to get the c2/m1 ratio close to the photon point , the jlab experiment was motivated by the possibility of determining the range of momentum transfers where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) would become applicable . in the limit of @xmath32 , pqcd predicts @xcite that only helicity - conserving amplitudes contribute , leading to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "starting from fixed-@xmath0 dispersion relations for the invariant amplitudes of pion photoproduction , the projection of the multipole amplitudes leads to a well known system of integral equations , @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for any of the multipoles @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the corresponding ( nucleon ) pole term .",
    "the kernels @xmath39 are known , and the real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes are related by unitarity . in the energy region below two - pion threshold , unitarity is expressed by the final state theorem of watson , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the corresponding @xmath42 phase shift and @xmath43 an integer .",
    "we have essentially followed the method of schwela et al @xcite to solve eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) with the constraint ( [ watson ] ) .",
    "in addition we have taken into account the coupling to some higher states neglected in that earlier reference . at the energies above two - pion threshold up to @xmath44 gev , eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) has been replaced by an ansatz based on unitarity @xcite . finally , the contribution of the dispersive integrals from @xmath45 gev to infinity has been replaced by @xmath0-channel exchange , parametrized by certain fractions of @xmath46- and @xmath47-exchange .",
    "furthermore , we have to allow for the addition of solutions of the homogeneous equations to the coupled system of eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) .",
    "the whole procedure introduces 9 free parameters , which have been determined by a fit to the data .",
    "@xcite    in figure 1 we show the @xmath48 multipoles @xmath49 and @xmath50 . our dispersion theoretical analysis ( solid line )",
    "agrees very well with our single - energy fit and with the single - energy fit of beck et al . @xcite .",
    "the only systematic deviation becomes visible in the electric multipole above the resonance position .",
    "this can be due either to our truncation of partial waves or to systematics in the experiment at the highest energies . in a new experiment",
    "a full angular coverage of the differential cross section for @xmath51 over a wide range of energy from threshold up to @xmath52 has been taken and in the near future a new and very precise multipole analysis should also clarify this small deviation .    according to the watson theorem , at least up to the two - pion threshold ,",
    "the ratio @xmath53 is a real quantity .",
    "however , it is not a constant but even a rather strongly energy dependent function .",
    "if we determine the resonance position as the point , where the phase @xmath54 , we can define the so - called `` full '' ratio @xmath55 we note that this ratio is identical to the ratio obtained with the @xmath56-matrix at the @xmath56-matrix pole @xmath57 .",
    "this can be seen by using the relation between the @xmath58- and the @xmath56-matrix , @xmath59 therefore , at @xmath57 we find @xmath60 the recent , nearly model - independent value of the mainz group at @xmath61 mev is @xmath62 @xcite is in excellent agreement with our dispersion theoretical calculation that gives @xmath63 , see table 1 .    .e2/m1 ratios for @xmath4=0 from different analyses . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also re - analyzed older desy @xcite data measured at @xmath64 and found significantly different results for the ratios compared to a previous analysis @xcite . however , since these data also give a @xmath65 value @xmath66 below our fit curves in figure 2 , we did not include them in our fits of the ratios .    in a similar way we also analyzed recent bates measurements @xcite for unpolarized differential cross sections , @xmath67 response function and @xmath68 asymmetry for @xmath69 at @xmath70 and obtained the following preliminary values for the e2/m1 and c2/m1 ratios @xmath71 finally , in a double polarization experiment at mainz @xcite , measuring the recoil polarization of the proton , @xmath72 at @xmath73 , a preliminary value of @xmath74",
    "could be extracted in a rather model - independent way from the x - component of the recoil polarization @xmath75 , which is very sensitive to the resonant @xmath76 multipole .",
    "our extracted values for @xmath77 and @xmath78 and a comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are presented in table 2 and shown in figure 3 . the main difference between our results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite is that our values of @xmath77 show a clear tendency to cross zero and change sign as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this is in contrast with the results obtained in the original analysis @xcite of the data which concluded that @xmath77 would stay negative and tend toward more negative values with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "in the framework of fixed - t dispersion relations with the new and very precise data obtained at mami in mainz we have obtained a new partial wave analysis for pion photoproduction . the uncertainties in most multipoles could be considerably improved compared to previous analyses . at the resonance position , where the phase passes @xmath79",
    ", we obtain an e2/m1 ratio of @xmath80 . at the pole in the complex plane",
    "we obtain the ratio of the resonant electric and magnetic multipoles as @xmath81 .",
    "this is a further model - independent ratio that can be determined in any analysis or calculation of pion photoproduction .    for pion electroproduction ,",
    "we have re - analyzed the recent jlab data for electroproduction of the @xmath2 resonance via @xmath82 with two models for pion electroproduction , both of which give excellent descriptions of the existing data .",
    "in contrast to previous findings , our models indicate that @xmath77 , starting from a small and negative value at the real photon point , actually exhibits a clear tendency to cross zero and change sign as @xmath4 increases . it will be most interesting to have data at yet higher momentum transfer in order to see whether such a trend continues , which would be a sign for a rather slow approach towards the pqcd region .",
    "furthermore , the absolute value of @xmath78 is strongly increasing , which indicates that the pqcd prediction of @xmath83 is not yet reached .",
