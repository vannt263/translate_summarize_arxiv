    "in recent years , progress in cosmology has been driven by the remarkable results of experiments such as _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "these experiments have made precise measurements of the geometry , the age , and the spectrum of density fluctuations of our universe . using @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) numerical simulations",
    ", we can track the evolution of the large scale structure of the dark matter from the era of quantum fluctuations to our current epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , significant problems in the simulations emerge when examining small scale structure and regions of high density where the complex range of baryonic physics becomes important @xcite .",
    "the next step forward in cosmology will therefore require a much better understanding of the physical processes involved in the interactions within the gas / star / black - hole ecosystem .",
    "feedback , powered by star formation , could play a crucial role in understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this is particularly true in past epochs , when the overall cosmic star formation rate was significantly higher @xcite . in regions of intense star formation ,",
    "short lived massive stars produce stellar winds and supernovae whose kinetic energy can collectively drive galactic scale outflows of metal enriched material into the galaxy halo and potentially into the intergalactic medium ( igm , * ? ? ?",
    "these `` superwinds '' can also enhance the fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes from the galaxy into the igm @xcite .",
    "therefore these complicated multi - phase winds are an important influence on the chemical and thermodynamical nature of the igm .",
    "they are also likely to play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies , particularly for low mass systems whose relatively shallow potential wells make them especially vulnerable to wind - driven loss of gas and metals @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength observations are required to understand the complex multiphase nature of galactic winds .",
    "the coronal gas ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 k ) and hot x - ray gas ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 k ) in galactic winds are particularly important .",
    "these phases are intimately connected to the mechanical / thermal energy that drive the outflows and to the metals the outflows carry .",
    "far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations of the coronal gas provide important insights into the cooling and kinematics of the galactic winds @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations probe the slowly cooling hot gas which is most likely to escape the galaxy @xcite .    the most widely studied population of high redshift star forming galaxies are the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies can be efficiently detected for @xmath9 using the lyman - break technique which picks out spectral band dropouts caused by the 912 @xmath10 lyman continuum discontinuity .",
    "they constitute a significant ( and possibly dominant ) fraction of the population of star forming galaxies during this important cosmic epoch @xcite .",
    "galactic winds appear to be a ubiquitous property of lbgs @xcite .",
    "the lbgs trace the most overdense regions of the universe , which are believed to be the progenitors of present day galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "they therefore play an important role in understanding the evolution of such clusters .",
    "in particular , winds from lbgs could be the process that heats and chemically enriches the intercluster medium ( icm , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge about the properties of the winds in lbgs is limited to what can be inferred from the interstellar uv absorption lines longward of lyman @xmath11 . because of their great distance , x - ray detections are almost impossible using current x - ray observatories .",
    "stacking techniques have been used to construct luminosity weighted average x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "a more fundamental problem is that the large redshifts of the lbgs mean that soft x - ray observations with",
    "_ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _  are observing at rest - frame energies above a few kev . in local star - forming galaxies the emission in this band is dominated by the population of x - ray binaries , and the thermal emission from the galactic wind is negligible @xcite .",
    "likewise , observations of the coronal phase gas is very difficult in lbgs .",
    "the most accessible probe of such gas is the fuv  @xmath121032,1038 doublet which lies deep within the lyman @xmath11 forest in the spectra of lbgs .",
    "it is clear that directly studying gas hotter than @xmath13k in high - redshift lbgs will continue to be very difficult or even impossible for the forseeable future .",
    "therefore , an important step in understanding galactic winds in lbgs would be to identify the best local analogs to lbgs and to then investigate their winds using the full suite of observations that are possible at low redshift .",
    "recently @xcite created a catalog of low redshift galaxies using _ galex _ @xcite uv observations of galaxies with spectra taken by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this catalog has now been significantly expanded based on additional _ galex _ data by hoopes et al .",
    "they used this matched catalog to select a sample of extraordinarily rare local ( z @xmath3 0.3 ) galaxies having the same uv luminosities , sizes , and surface brightnesses as typical lbgs .",
    "they then showed that these galaxies have the same star formation rates ( sfrs ) , galaxy masses , velocity dispersions , and chemical compositions as typical lbgs .",
    "based on the sample observed to date with _ galex _ ,",
    "vv 114   at z @xmath14 0.02 is the closest known lbg analog , thus making it ideal for x - ray and fuv studies .    _ hst _ nicmos and stis observations by @xcite of vv 114  ( arp 236 ) have shown two distinct interacting / merging components to the galaxy .",
    "the two components are separated by 6 kpc in projection ( @xmath15 ) . the eastern component , while prominent in the nir nicmos images , is almost invisible in the stis uv images due to heavy dust obscuration .",
    "the western component is very bright in the uv , with a far - uv luminosity of @xmath16 , half light radius of 2.3 kpc , and effective mean surface brightness of @xmath17 , all comparable in value to those of lbgs @xcite .",
    "co ( 1 - 2 ) observations by @xcite show that the molecular gas is centered between the two components of vv 114 .",
    "their measured velocities of the molecular gas coincident with the western component show a rotating disk with a velocity range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite also show , from 1.4 ghz radio continuum observations , that star formation is spread throughout the vv 114  system .",
    "the nir , mir and co ( 3 - 2 ) emission of vv 114   is dominated by a source at the center of the eastern component .",
    "combinations of compact star formation @xcite and an obscured agn @xcite have been used to explain the emission .",
    "the observed iras @xmath20 @xcite is then a measure of the entire system s sfr and implies a total sfr of @xmath21 per year @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the star formation is split roughly equally between the two components .",
    "these properties are summarized in table [ prop ] .",
    "the _ fuse _  spacecraft is composed of four separate mirrors and two detectors @xcite .",
    "two mirrors are coated with lif and two with sic .",
    "the lif mirrors have better sensitivity in the @xmath22 wavelength region while the sic are optimized for observations in the range between @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "observation pointing is controlled by a fine error sensor ( fes ) camera located along the lif1 channel which results in a pointing rms of @xmath25 .",
    "_ fuse _ observed vv 114  ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) using the lwrs aperture ( @xmath28 ) on july 26 , 2003 .",
    "the observations were centered on the fuv emitting western component of vv 114 .",
    "the _ fuse _ aperture is shown overlayed on the _ hst stis _ fuv ( f25srf2 ) observation of vv 114  in figure [ stis ] .    the _ fuse _ observation of vv 114  was split into five exposures . for every exposure and detector segment",
    "a raw time - tagged event list was produced .",
    "we processed each event list using the latest _ fuse _ calibration software , calfuse v3.1.2 @xcite .",
    "this software applies flux and wavelength calibrations while correcting for a variety of effects including instrument motion , geometric distortions , spacecraft doppler shifts , event bursts , and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "the hydrogen lyman series absorption lines dominate the spectrum below @xmath29 so we have focused on the longer _ fuse _  wavelenths . as the lif channels have a greater sensitivity and thus better s / n we have ignored the sic channels in our data analysis .",
    "a comparison of the lif1 guiding channel to the lif2 channel confirms that channel drift is negligible for our data . in order to co - add the spectra we cross correlated the spectra to correct for small wavelength shifts . also , as the count rate is significantly lower in the first exposure , we have excluded it from the final combined spectra for each channel .",
    "this produces four combined spectra , lif1a and lif2b covering @xmath30 and lif1b and lif2a in the range between @xmath31 . the best spectrum in each of the two wavelength regions is shown in figure [ 2spec ] .",
    "we have also labeled the most prominent fuv ism absorption lines , stellar photospheric lines , milky way absorption lines , and airglow features .",
    "the spectra around several of the most prominent ism absorption lines are shown in figure [ multipleabs ] .",
    "an examination of the spectrum of vv 114  shows that it is dominated by broad ism absorption lines .",
    "the strongest lines ( e.g. ly  @xmath32 ,  @xmath33977 ,  @xmath331036 ) are saturated in their cores .",
    "most of the strong , higher s / n lines show common structures in their profiles .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ 3abs ] where we have vertically aligned the  @xmath331084 ,  @xmath331036 , and  @xmath331134 absorption lines . some of the small scale absorption features are found at @xmath146300 , 6100 , and 5900 @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 component is interesting as it could be infalling material or non - circular motion from the ongoing merger of the two galaxy components .",
    "more important however is the general shape of the absorption line profiles .",
    "all three lines in figure [ 3abs ] are asymmetric , with a pronounced wing of blueshifted absorption extending down to @xmath145000 @xmath34 .    to fit the lines we used the iraf tool _",
    "specfit _ @xcite .",
    "initially , each line was fit separately using a freely variable powerlaw for the continuum and a symmetric gaussian absorption line .",
    "as we have double coverage of most wavelength regions , we independently measure most of the absorption lines and continuum twice . for many of the lines ,",
    "the line width ( fwhm ) is not well constrained so we have fixed it to @xmath36 which is a value consistent with our fits to the strong lines .",
    "some additional complications are also important to note .",
    "the  @xmath331036 and  @xmath331039 lines are mildly blended so we have fixed the central velocity of the  @xmath331039 line relative to that of the .",
    "we then tied the two fwhms together and fit the two lines .",
    "we used the same approach with the two strongly blended lines ,  @xmath33989 and  @xmath33990 .",
    "although we were able to fit these two lines , they are badly blended and so there is a significant uncertainty in our derived parameters .",
    "table [ absdata ] shows the results of our fits to the data .",
    "errors are one @xmath37 and are calculated from a rescaled inversion of the curvature matrix .",
    "there are a few weak lines in the spectra that we have not fit due to their low s / n .",
    "the single component fits above do not account for the blueshifted component clearly seen in the higher s / n absorption lines .",
    "therefore , for the strongest lines ( e.g. , , , ) we have refit the data with a second blueshifted gaussian absorption line . we have excluded the strongly blended lines  @xmath33989 and  @xmath33990 and the heavily saturated lyman@xmath32 and  @xmath33977 lines from these new fits . was also excluded as it clearly has a different line profile than the other strong lines ( see below ) .",
    "the 2-component fits are shown in figure [ 3abs ] and table [ twoabsdata ] and significantly improve the fit quality of each line .",
    "the results for the different lines are all consistent with a strong absorption line at @xmath38 with a second blueshifted line at @xmath39 .",
    "the blueshifted component generally has an equivalent width of typically about 0.4 that of the principal component and a marginally smaller fwhm .",
    "the success of the two absorption component fits suggests an inadequacy in the single line fits .",
    "this provides a caution in using the single line fits to determine central velocities of the absorption lines .",
    "the blueshifted component is probably a general feature , but is not conspicuous in the weaker lines due to their lower s / n .",
    "several prominent stellar photospheric absorption lines are observed in the data .",
    "these lines allow us to independently constrain the velocity of the uv emitting portion of vv 114 .",
    "we have fit these absorption lines in the same manner as described above .",
    "the line centroids were tied together in order to strongly constrain the relative velocity .",
    "our fit results can be found in table [ phabsdata ] .",
    "the fitted fwhms of the photospheric lines are significantly narrower at @xmath40 than the ism fwhms ( @xmath41 ) . combining the measurements we find a system velocity of @xmath42 .",
    "vv 114  was observed by _",
    "chandra _ on october 20 , 2005 .",
    "the data was obtained using very faint mode with the galaxy centered on the acis s3 aim point .",
    "standard data processing was applied using caldb 3.1.0 and ascdsver 7.6.3 @xcite .",
    "less than 1 ks of observation time was lost due to anomolous background levels leaving 58.8 ks of total integration time .",
    "for image and spectral analysis we followed the same procedures as previously described in @xcite . using an image of the counts in the 0.3 - 1.0 kev range we calculated a 90% counts enclosed radius for vv 114  of 4.4 kpc .",
    "the 0.3 - 1.0 kev band was chosen as it is sensitive to the diffuse thermal emission and minimizes point source contamination .",
    "we also created adaptively smoothed images using the ciao task csmooth .",
    "for all of our spectral analysis a local background was used .",
    "the background was centered on the galaxy but excluded all diffuse and point source emission .",
    "spectra were extracted using the ciao script specextract and grouped using a minimum of 20 counts per bin .    the high spatial resolution _",
    "chandra _  counts ( 0.3 - 8.0 kev ) image in figure [ chandracnts ] has several interesting features . both the eastern and western components are clearly observed .",
    "the western component dominates the x - ray emission and has a similar morphology to that seen in the stis data .",
    "the peak of the x - ray emission coincides with the brightest star cluster seen in the uv .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is seen to the south of the galaxy and extends far beyond the limits of the fuv and nir emission .",
    "figure [ chandrafalse ] shows an adaptively smoothed chandra false color image of the galaxy . the emission from vv 114e is harder than that from the western component",
    "this is consistent with the high column densities suggested by the fuv observations ( figure [ stis ] ) .",
    "soft x - rays from vv 114e are absorbed so that , as in the fuv , the soft x - ray emission is primarily tracing vv 114w .",
    "figure [ all_vs_east ] has a soft band image of the entire galaxy with a blown up picture of the inner regions in the hard band .",
    "a compact source is also detected near the center of vv 114e .",
    "it is coincident with the unresolved source seen in the nicmos and lower resolution spitzer irac images .",
    "the spectra were well fit by a model that included an absorption column , a thermal plasma model , and an absorbed powerlaw .",
    "xspec s vmekal model was used which allows for variable metallicities .",
    "the derived model fit parameters are listed in table [ xspecdata ] while the data and fit are plotted in figure [ xspec ] .",
    "following @xcite we have only calculated the @xmath1  ratio due to degeneracies in the model fit in determining the absolute elemental abundances .",
    "the @xmath1  ratio of @xmath43 ( 90% confidence ) assumes the default xspec solar abundances of @xcite .",
    "more recent abundance measurements from @xcite obtain comparable results with an @xmath1  ratio of @xmath44 .",
    "the 0.3 - 2.0 kev luminosity of the thermal emission vv 114e is @xmath45 erg s@xmath46 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  data was retrieved from the us public archive at heasarc , and analyzed using version 5.3 of the standard analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "the latest calibration files available at the time were used .",
    "images and spectra were extracted from the mos1 and mos2 events files produced by the xmm - newton data pipeline , with total exposures of 11367 and 11348 seconds respectively .",
    "no data from the pn detector was available .",
    "the spectra of vv 114 included all events within a radius of @xmath47 of the peak in the soft x - ray emission seen in the x - ray images , which closely coincides with the ned position for vv 114 .",
    "a background spectrum was taken in an annulus of inner and outer radii @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the spectra was subsequently analyzed using xspec 11.2 .",
    "we simultaneously fit the mos1 and mos2 spectra using the same model as for the _ chandra _  data .",
    "table [ xspecdata ] lists the derived model parameters while figure [ xspec ] shows the unfolded spectra and model components .",
    "the results of the _ xmm - newton _  fit are consistent with those from the longer exposure , higher quality _ chandra _  data .",
    "the derived vmekal plasma temperature is @xmath50 kev with an @xmath1  ratio of @xmath51 ( abundances from @xcite ) .",
    "the @xcite abundances obtain similar results with an @xmath1  ratio of @xmath52 ( 90% confidence ) . we ve also derived the absorption corrected luminosity of the thermal plasma as @xmath53 erg s@xmath46  in the 0.3 - 2.0 kev energy range .",
    "while the western component of vv 114  dominates the uv and x - ray emission , vv 114e is the more powerful near - ir emitter ( right panel in figure [ chandrafalse ] ) .",
    "nir spectral observations by @xcite show evidence of a gas photo - ionized by @xmath54 ob stars in vv 114e .",
    "the extended emission observed in the radio @xcite and nir @xcite bolster the argument that a compact starburst dominates vv 114e .",
    "@xcite however observed a continuum bump at 5 - 6 which is typical of agn spectra .",
    "they suggest that a heavily absorbed agn could contribute up to 40% of the mid - ir flux in vv 114e .",
    "we extracted _ chandra _  spectra of a small circular region surrounding vv 114e .",
    "the extracted spectra can be seen in figure [ vv114e ] .",
    "this region encloses roughly 600 counts , about 10% of the total counts observed in vv 114 .",
    "the spectra is heavily absorbed requiring @xmath55 . a fairly flat powerlaw is also fit with a photon index of @xmath56 , consistent with the existence of a buried agn .",
    "we initially fit the lower energy spectra of vv 114e with a simple absorbed thermal plasma model with variable abundances .",
    "this provides a poor fit and requires abundances of over 13 times solar values .",
    "the super - solar abundances are driven by the enhanced si ( @xmath57kev ) and mg ( @xmath58kev ) line emission .",
    "this is typical in photo - ionization regions and is seen in stellar winds from high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ob stars @xcite , and some obscured agn @xcite .",
    "the addition of two gaussians to the model fit results in reasonable sub - solar abundances and a significantly better fit with a reduced @xmath59 ( figure [ vv114e ] ) .",
    "the thermal plasma dominates the emission in the 0.3 - 2.0 kev range with an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath60 .",
    "the eastern component s thermal plasma luminosity of @xmath60 is comparable to the luminosity we inferred for the * entire * galaxy in section [ chandraobs ] .",
    "as the observed photons are primarily from the unabsorbed western component a successful model can ignore the heavily absorbed eastern component .",
    "however , this causes us to underestimate the soft x - ray luminosity of vv 114  by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "this complication does not occur in the harder x - ray range where we derive the 2 - 10 kev luminosities for the eastern and western components as @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "previous works @xcite have shown that the hard x - ray emission can be used as a sfr tracer .",
    "assuming the hard x - ray emission is tracing hmxbs and not contaminated by an agn we can derive the sfr for the two galaxy components .",
    "this implies that they have a roughly equal star formation rate with @xmath64 for vv 114e and @xmath65 for vv 114w @xcite .",
    "the total star formation rate of @xmath66 ( 30% scatter ) is consistent with the @xmath67 inferred from the fir luminosity suggesting that star formation is the dominant energy source .",
    "an agn contribution however is still not ruled out .",
    "although @xmath68 emission is not observed in the binned ( minimum 20 counts ) spectra of vv 114e , we have extracted an image in the 6.25 - 6.55 kev range .",
    "a single feature , centered on the unresolved source in the _ chandra _  and nicmos images , is visible .",
    "the five detected counts are well above the expected contribution from the background plus the fitted powerlaw of less than 0.01 counts .",
    "we extracted unbinned spectra from circular region with a diameter of 2.3(1 kpc ) and centered on the unresolved source in vv 114e .",
    "we fit the spectra with a gaussian centroided at 6.4 kev and found a best fit equivalent width of 0.3 kev .",
    "as the gaussian is poorly constrained , we have instead found a 90 % confidence level upper limit on the equivalent width of 1.3 kev .",
    "the luminosity in the @xmath68 line is @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite have studied a sample of heavily absorbed agn and found that the ir and @xmath68 emission line luminosities are correlated with @xmath70 . for vv 114",
    "this would suggest a 90 % confidence upper limit to the agn contribution of @xmath71 .",
    "this is significantly less than the @xmath72 observed by iras .",
    "this supports the idea that a compact nuclear starburst dominates the central region of vv 114e .",
    "the weak detection of @xmath68 is also consistent with the nuclear starburst argument .",
    "we note that @xmath68 lines are detected in hmxbs @xcite .",
    "assuming that the 2.0 - 10 kev luminosity is not contaminated by an agn , almost one quarter of the sf in the entire galaxy is concentrated within a region 1 kpc in diameter at the center of vv 114e .    we conclude that while a highly obscured agn _ may _ be present in the nucleus of vv 114e , it would not contribute significantly to the bolometric luminosity of the vv 114  system .",
    "the energetics of vv 114  are instead dominated by the intense episode of star formation it is undergoing .",
    "the success of the two component fits to the absorption line profiles suggest a simple dynamical picture .",
    "the stronger absorption feature at @xmath38 traces the ism of vv 114w .",
    "this velocity is consistent with that of the molecular gas of the western component .",
    "the stellar absorption lines , which we would also expect to be associated with the western component , appear to be at a slightly lower central speed of @xmath73 .",
    "this difference in velocities could be explained by a systematic error in the two component absorption model caused by degeneracy in some of the fit parameters . a difference in the relative spatial distribution between the hot stars and ism and",
    "the way they sample the galaxy rotation curve could also explain this small velocity shift .",
    "the blueshifted ism absorption feature has a mean velocity of @xmath39 , implying an outflow of gas moving at a mean velocity of @xmath14300 - 400  @xmath34 away from the galaxy .",
    "weaker absorption can be seen at velocities as low as @xmath74 ( e.g. and ) , suggesting that the wind is accelerating clouds up to outflow velocities as high as @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to compare our results to previous absorption line studies of lbgs . in the composite lbg spectrum created by @xcite",
    "they measure broad ( fwhm@xmath76 ) and blueshifted ( @xmath77 ) ism absorption lines . in the observations of cb58 by @xcite",
    "they find a mean outflow speed of @xmath78 and slightly broader lines .",
    "both these results are consistent with what we observe in vv 114 .",
    "it is also interesting that the kinematics of the coronal gas as traced by the  absorption line is different from what is seen in the cooler gas . in the single absorption component",
    "fits the centroid of the  absorption line is blueshifted by about 100 @xmath34 compared to the other strong lines , and the line profile is much more symmetric .",
    "absorption in  can be seen at velocities as low as @xmath79 , consistent with outflow velocities as high as @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately , the blue wing of the  line merges with the red wing of the adjacent lyman @xmath32 line , making it impossible to tell if even faster moving coronal gas might be present .",
    "the different kinematics of the  line implies a different physical origin . the  line is a particularly interesting one due to its importance in radiative cooling and the relatively narrow temperature range over which it is a significant ion .",
    "@xcite also observed  absorption in the dwarf starburst ngc  1705 . in ngc  1705",
    "the   line was also more strongly blueshifted than the other ions .",
    "they attributed the production of   to the intermediate temperature regions created by the hydrodynamical interaction between hot outrushing gas and the cool fragments of the ruptured superbubble seen in h@xmath11 images .",
    "such a situation is predicted to be created as an overpressured superbubble accelerates and then fragments as it expands out of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite derive a simple and general relationship between the   column density and absorption line width which will hold whenever there is a radiatively cooling gas flow passing through the coronal temperature regime .",
    "they showed that this simple model accounted for the properties of   absorption line systems as diverse as clouds in the disk and halo of the milky way , high velocity clouds , the magellanic clouds , starburst outflows , and the clouds in the igm . using the measured equivalent width in table [ absdata ]",
    "we have measured an  column density of @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ ovi ] shows the predictions and data from @xcite and includes vv 114 .",
    "vv 114  has the both the highest   column density and broadest line width in the plot , and is fully consistent with the model predictions .",
    "it would then trace radiatively cooling gas in a high speed outflow .    for the outflow components , it is interesting to estimate the mass and energy outflow rates .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume a mass - conserving outflow with a constant velocity .",
    "this allows us to estimate the mass and energy outflow rate in the wind from the total gas column density , outflow velocity and starburst radius ( equations 5 and 6 in @xcite ) . to estimate the gas column density in the outflow we use ionic column densities for the blueshifted wind component derived from the strongest unsaturated lines",
    "we then convert these into hydrogen column densities assuming solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundances of @xmath82 log[o / h ] @xmath83 8.6 and 8.7 @xcite for the two most prominent knots in vv 114w suggests that this is reasonable .",
    "the hydrogen column density in the neutral gas can be measured from both and .",
    "both predict a column density of about @xmath84 .",
    "the column density leads to a corresponding ionized hydrogen column density of @xmath85 .",
    "this is a lower limit since we make no correction for more highly ionized nitrogen .",
    "finally , predicts a lower limit to the hydrogen column of the coronal phase of the outflow of @xmath86 , based on the maximum possible ionic fraction of @xmath1420% for collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the lower bound to the total hydrogen column density in the outflow is then @xmath87 . taken a starburst radius of 2.3 kpc ( @xmath88 ) , and an outflow velocity of @xmath89 we find an mass outflow rate of @xmath90 per year and a kinetic energy outflow rate of @xmath91 erg / sec ( assuming a wind opening angle of 4@xmath92 steradians ) .",
    "the derived values are in table [ outflow ] . to put these values into context , in section [ vv114star ] we estimated the star formation rate of vv 114w as roughly 24 - 33 @xmath93 .",
    "the implied star formation rate is of order the outflow rate",
    ". the total rate at which supernovae and stellar winds provide mechanical energy in vv  114w is @xmath94 erg / sec , and the estimated energy outflow rate is therefore only @xmath145% of the total .",
    "these results are similar to what is seen in typical far - ir luminous starburst galaxies based on the interstellar nai d absorption - line @xcite .",
    "we can use the parameters for the fit to the total chandra and xmm x - ray spectra of the diffuse gas in vv 114   to derive estimates for the basic physical properties of the hot phase of the wind .",
    "the normalization for the vmekal component implies an emission integral ( the volume integral of density squared ) of @xmath95 @xmath96 . for the geometrical volume of the emitting region",
    "we take a sphere whose radius encompasses 90% of the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath144.5 kpc ) .",
    "this then implies a mean gas density of @xmath97 @xmath96 and a gas mass of @xmath98 m@xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the volume filling factor of the x - ray emitting material ) . for kt = 0.59",
    "kev the mean thermal pressure is @xmath101 dynes @xmath102 and the total thermal energy content of the hot gas is @xmath103 ergs .",
    "taking the characteristic timescale to be the above radius ( 4.5 kpc ) divided by the sound speed in the hot gas ( @xmath14 500 km / sec ) yields an age of 9 myr .",
    "the implied outflow rates in the hot gas are then @xmath104 m@xmath99/year and @xmath105 erg / sec . for volume filling factors similar to those estimated for other starburst winds ( @xmath106 0.1 to 1 ) ,",
    "the implied mass outflow rate in vv 114  is comparable to the total star formation rate ( @xmath14 30 m@xmath99/year ) and the rate of energy transport is comparable to the total rate at which mechanical energy would be supplied by supernovae and stellar winds in the starburst ( @xmath107 erg / sec ) .",
    "these outflow rates significantly exceed the rates for the cooler gas derived from the @xmath108 data above , but are are typical of winds in powerful local starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in @xcite we studied the x - ray properties of 22 star forming galaxies spanning over 4 orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity including ulirgs  like arp  220 , normal starbursts like m  82 , and dwarf starbursts like ngc  1705 .",
    "our principal conclusion was that the properties of the hot gas in all of these star forming galaxies were remarkably similar .",
    "in general , simple scaling relations were able to explain many of the differences between the galaxies in the sample .",
    "these relationships are consistent with the basic superwind scenario in which the mechanical energy deposited by stellar winds and supernovae results in an over - pressurized cavity of hot gas within the starburst . the cavity will expand , driving the hot gas outwards , possibly out of the galaxy and into the surrounding igm .",
    "in our study we saw that the luminosity of the diffuse soft x - ray emission was roughly linearly proportional to the sfr ( e.g. @xmath109 ) .",
    "vv 114   is no exception as can be seen in figure [ div_l_k ] . in this figure",
    "we have divided both the fir and x - ray luminosities by the k - band luminosity . by dividing by the k - band luminosity , a proxy for stellar mass ,",
    "we show that it not merely a matter of more massive galaxies having higher sfrs and x - ray luminosities .",
    "the linear scaling between x - ray luminosity and @xmath109  suggests a constant efficiency in converting mechanical energy from the galactic winds into emission from hot gas .",
    "the size scale of the region of x - ray emission will also depend upon the rate at which the starburst supplies mass and energy to the wind , and this relation is shown in figure [ r90 ] where we have plotted the 90% x - ray flux ( 0.3 - 1.0 kev ) enclosed radius vs the fir luminosity .",
    "again , vv 114  follows the same trends seen in the other starbursts .",
    "in @xcite we also showed there was a trend for the starbursts with the highest sfr per unit area ( as traced by the fir color - temperature of the warm dust ) to have the hottest x - ray gas .",
    "again vv 114  is consistent with this trend , as shown in figure [ f60o100vkt ] .",
    "lastly , in agreement with the starbursts in @xcite , vv 114  appears to have an @xmath1   element ratio that is enhanced ( by a factor of @xmath142 ) relative to solar abundances .",
    "an enhanced @xmath1  element ratio would be expected in a starburst galaxy as the hot gas could be significantly enriched by the material injected by the core - collapse supernovae driving the winds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare vv 114  to the ulirgs .",
    "although it follows the same scaling relations as the ulirgs  it does not appear to live in the same parameter space . obviously , it has a lower fir luminosity and thus sfr .",
    "it also has a slightly smaller but similar k - band luminosity than the average ulirgs  ( and hence a correspondingly similar stellar mass ) .",
    "lastly vv 114  has slightly lower gas and dust temperatures than the ulirgs .",
    "this suggests that vv 114   is a similar mass galaxy with a lower sfr per unit area than the ulirgs  and is intermediate between the normal starbursts and ulirgs .",
    "one of the major puzzles in cosmology is the nature of the objects responsible for the reionization of the universe , which may have started as early as z @xmath1430 and was complete by z@xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the known population of agn do not appear to be sufficient by a wide margin , and the leading candidates are star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of a significant flux of ionizing radiation escaping from lbgs based on the detection of flux in the rest - frame lyman continuum .",
    "however , other studies of high - z star forming galaxies have reached different conclusions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there have been several attempts to measure the fraction of the ionizing radiation escaping from local starbursts ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the hope is that investigations of local star forming galaxies will allow us to understand the physical processes that determine @xmath110 so that we can apply these lessons to high redshift galaxies for which our information is less complete .",
    "@xcite reported the first direct measurements of @xmath110 using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope to observe below the rest - frame lyman edge in a sample of four local starbursts , and these data were later reanalyzed by @xcite .",
    "the resulting upper limits on @xmath110 were typically 10% .",
    "@xcite have obtained similar data with fuse for the starburst galaxy mrk  54 at z = 0.0448 .",
    "no flux was detected below the lyman edge in the rest frame . by comparison with the number of ionizing photons derived from the h@xmath11 line",
    ", they set an upper limit to @xmath110 of 6% .",
    "@xcite used fuse in a different way to constrain @xmath110 in a sample five of the uv - brightest local starburst galaxies .",
    "they showed that the strong  @xmath331036 interstellar absorption - line is black in its core .",
    "since the photoelectric opacity of the neutral ism below the lyman - edge will be significantly larger than in the line , they were able to use these data to set a typical upper limit on @xmath110 of 6% in these galaxies .",
    "inclusion of absorption of lyman continuum photons by dust grains will further decrease @xmath110 ( by up to an order of magnitude in some cases ) .",
    "they also assessed the idea that strong galactic winds can clear channels through the neutral ism of the galaxy and thereby increase @xmath110 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given the presence of a strong wind in vv 114   and the overall similarity between vv 114  and typical lbgs , it is interesting to determine @xmath110 in this object .",
    "as can be seen in figures 2 and 3 , the  @xmath331036 line in vv 114  is quite black at line center .",
    "this is particularly striking as the large fuse aperture samples all of the sightlines towards vv 114w . following the precepts of @xcite we find that @xmath110 is smaller than a few percent in vv 114w .",
    "the escape fraction decreases even further if we consider that all of the fuv radiation from vv 114e is also being absorbed .    in this aspect",
    "then , vv 114   is apparently quite different from the lbgs studied by @xcite .",
    "it also differs from haro  11 , which is the only local case known in which ionizing radiation is escaping from a galaxy @xcite . since haro  11 and",
    "vv 114  are similar in many ways , it will important to understand why they are different in this crucial respect .",
    "understanding the role played by the feedback from star formation in the evolution of galaxies and the igm is a crucial problem in cosmology @xcite . in the local universe",
    ", detailed observations of starburst galaxies have shown that this feedback is manifested most dramatically in the form of galactic winds that are driven by the collective effect of the kinetic energy supplied by winds from massive stars and supernova explosions .",
    "the outflows are complex multi - phase phenomena whose physical , chemical , and dynamical properties can only be understood through complemetary observations at many wavebands @xcite .",
    "observations of the coronal ( @xmath111 to @xmath6 k ) and hot ( @xmath6 to @xmath8k ) gas are particularly important , as they provide essential information about the importance of radiative cooling of the outflow and about the dynamics and energy content of the wind .",
    "the coronal gas is best traced through the doublet in the far - uv and the hot g ! as is best traced via its soft x - ray emission .",
    "the strong overall cosmic evolution in the global star formation rate @xcite means that the bulk of the feedback from galactic winds occurred at early times ( @xmath112 1 ) .",
    "indeed , the direct signature of galactic winds  the presence of broad , blueshifted interstellar absorption lines in the rest - frame uv  is generically present in the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , * ? ? ?",
    "these are the best - studied population of high - redshift star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , such data provide only a narrow range of information about galactic winds . unfortunately , direct observations of the hotter gas in the rest - frame soft x - ray and fuv regions for high redshift galaxies are extremely difficult or even impossible , which hinders progress in understanding this complex phenomenon . finding and studying nearby analogs to lbgs is therefore very important .    in this paper",
    "we have described fuv and soft x - ray observations of vv 114 , the nearest known galaxy whose basic properties are a good match to those of typical lbgs @xcite . our _ fuse _",
    "observations in the fuv show strong and very broad interstellar absorption lines .",
    "the lines with the highest s / n show two kinematic components .",
    "one is centered near the galaxy systemic velocity and apparently corresponds to the galaxy ism .",
    "the second component is strongly blueshifted , with a centroid 300 to 400 @xmath34 below systemic velocity and weaker absorption extending to blueshifts as high as @xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen at slightly longer rest wavelengths in high redshift lbgs and further establishes the similarity of vv 114  to the lbgs .",
    "the  absorption line covers a similar range in velocity to the other ions , but has a much more symmetric profile .",
    "this suggests a different origin for the coronal - phase absorbing gas .",
    "the high column density and broad width of the  line are consistent with production of  in gas that is cooling radiatively from high temperature through the coronal regime .",
    "one possible origin for this gas is at the interface between the hot outflowing gas seen in x - rays and the cool clouds in the galaxy halo .",
    "these cooler clouds may be traced by the absorption lines from the cooler gas seen in the _ fuse _",
    "observations .",
    "observations with _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  of the hot diffuse gas in vv 114  are consistent with those seen in a local sample of star forming galaxies with galactic outflows",
    ". as expected based on its far - ir luminosity and implied sfr , vv 114  has x - ray properties intermediate between those of ulirgs  and those of more typical present - day starbursts .",
    "this suggests that diffuse thermal x - ray emission should be a common feature of lbgs created in the shocks between the outflowing wind material and surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "hard x - ray , far - ir , and radio continuum observations suggest that half of the star formation in vv 114  is not easily observable in the uv and soft x - ray as it is taking place in the heavily obscured eastern component of vv 114 .",
    "the strong wind in vv 114   might in principle be able to carve a channel in the ism through which ionizing photons could escape from the starburst to the igm .",
    "however , we show that the fact that the core of the  @xmath331036 absorption line is black implies that the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from vv 114   is no more than a few percent . this low escape fraction in vv 114",
    "is quite different from that seen in the lbgs studied by @xcite .    as the sample of nearby lgb - analogs discovered by galex grows",
    ", we will be able to eventually conduct multi - waveband investigations of the galactic winds in a sample large enough for us to be able to make robust statements about the physical , chemical , and dynamical properties of these objects .",
    "this should have important implications for the evolution of galaxies and the igm .",
