    "it is well established that dark matter ( dm ) dominates the matter in the universe , but the identity of dm remains unclear . the direct detection experiments aim to decode the dm non - gravitational interactions by observing the scattering of dm off detector materials  @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been made to search for such events for decades .",
    "two collaborations , dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite , have claimed the evidences for annual modulation in the differential event rate , which is a characteristic property due to the motion of the earth around the sun  @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation points to a low mass @xmath1gev dm spin - independently ( si ) elastic scattering off nucleon with cross sections around @xmath2 pb . it , however , turns out that dama tends to favor a relatively larger cross section than cogent does .",
    "moreover , they contradict with the null experiments cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite results , which put most stringent constraints on the si dm - nucleon scattering cross sections .    in order to alleviate the tension between the cogent , dama results and the constraints of cdms and xenon , various theoretical attempts and solutions",
    "have been put forward  @xcite . among them , isospin - violating dark matter ( ivdm )  @xcite draws a lot of interests .",
    "it was proposed that the dm particles might couple differently to the protons and neutrons . under this generic assumption ,",
    "one therefore gains an additional degree of freedom , @xmath3 , the ratio between the two couplings .",
    "if it satisfies @xmath4 for a given nuclear isotope @xmath5 , the scattering amplitudes will interfere destructively and cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the constraints from the corresponding isotope could be completely evaded .",
    "there are also huge experimental efforts to detect dm indirectly through the detection of secondary products of dm annihilation in the galaxy or astrophysical bodies  @xcite .",
    "one promising way is to detect the high energetic neutrino signals resulting from the annihilation of dm that have been gravitationally captured by the sun  @xcite , using the neutrino telescopes on the earth , such as super - kamiokande ( super - k )  @xcite and icecube  @xcite .",
    "the most severe constraints set on the low mass dm are given by super - k data .",
    "in this paper , we study the neutrinos flux coming from annihilation of ivdm in the sun .    throughout the discussion",
    ", we will assume the dm particle is symmetric , namely it can have significant annihilation when the number density is higher .",
    "we will comment on the scenario of asymmetric dm case in the end of the paper .",
    "in this section , we discuss the general consequences of isospin - violating dm - nucleon interactions in various dm direct / indirect detection approaches .",
    "we will focus on the class of spin - independent interactions .    for ground - based direct detection experimental target containing a certain element @xmath6 with nucleon and proton numbers @xmath7 ,",
    "the ratio of the isospin - violating ( iv ) cross section to isospin - conservative ( ic ) cross section is @xmath8 ^ 2}{a_i^2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phenomenologically favored ratio is found to be @xmath9 . due to destructive interference in the amplitude ,",
    "the direct detection rate gets reduced significantly .",
    "the suppression factor turns out to be about @xmath10 for xenon and @xmath11 for germanium , while it is about @xmath12 for sodium .",
    "this feature acts as the key factor to reconcile the results of dama , cogent and xenon experiments .    on the other hand , the capture of dm in the sun",
    "is dominated by light elements for low mass dm favored by cogent and dama results , namely helium for isospin - conserving case and hydrogen for isospin - violating case .",
    "the contributions of heavier elements are suppressed by their small chemical abundance .",
    "therefore , the suppression factor for capture is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the mass for nucleus @xmath6 . taking into account of the presence of different isotopes",
    ", we list the reduction factors in direct detection and solar capture rates in table .",
    ".the suppression factors in the direct detection experiments and solar capture process , with @xmath16 and @xmath17gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the state - of - art technique to study the neutrino flux from cosmic rays is to observe up - going muons into the detector .",
    "these muons signals are generated by muon neutrino interacting with rocks as well as materials ( e.g. , water ) inside the detector .",
    "here we follow refs .",
    "@xcite to calculate the muon rate generated in the presence of neutrino flux obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "@xmath18 + ( { \\rm antineutrino})\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the square bracket represents the probability of muon being generated from charge - current weak interactions with cross section @xmath19 , and traveling though the average length @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the mass density of the rocks or the water .",
    "the charged current interaction with nucleons can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the interactions of anti - neutrinos are similar , but with parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the average length that muon travels before losing its energy below the detector threshold energy @xmath31 is parametrized by @xmath32 where we have taken the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the calculations .    the super - k experiment  @xcite measures the cherenkov radiation of energetic muons generated in the charge - current interactions .",
    "the effective area of detection is around @xmath35 , and the @xmath36live days measurement allows at most 11 events other than originating from the atmosphere neutrino background  @xcite at 95% confidence level .",
    "we use this as the upper bound on the number events @xmath37 from dm annihilations in the sun , where the factor @xmath38 accounts for the nighttime .",
    "we have plotted the constraints on dm - nucleon cross section in fig .  [ 3 ] , including both direct detections and indirect detection via neutrinos from the sun .",
    "we focus on the low mass dm region in light of the recent direct detection excitement . as was noticed in  @xcite , the positive signals from dama and cogent",
    "can be reconciled by including isospin - violating dm - nucleon interactions .",
    "isospin violation effect can also relieve the tension with the null results of xenon experiments , but can not remove the constraints from cdms which uses the same material as cogent  @xcite .",
    "an interesting finding is that the indirect detection with neutrinos from dm annihilation in the sun imposes a stronger constraint if the annihilation final states are neutrino - rich , i.e. , @xmath39 or @xmath40 ( or marginally @xmath41 ) , as shown by the solid curves in the fig .",
    "the annihilation to light quarks or muon is still allowed , since they would lose most energy before decay , due to relatively longer lifetimes .",
    "therefore , the qualified ivdm candidates should annihilate preferably into light flavors .",
    "this is a model - independent result , originating from the hierarchical nature characterized in reduction factors for different rates , as shown in table .",
    "it brings more challenge for the dm model building .",
    "one possibility could be the portal bridges the dm sector only to the first generation fermions in the sm sector .",
    "the couplings to second generation quarks ( like @xmath41 ) could then be induced but safely suppressed by the cabibbo mixing angle .",
    "a second message we can learn from table  [ 4 ] and fig .  [ 2 ] is , the suppression factor of the total capture rate is always larger than 1/50 , still less suppressed compared to those in direct detection experiments .",
    "therefore , even in the case of inelastic scattering where elements heavier than helium are more likely to dominant  @xcite , the indirect detection from the sun could still impose an important constraint .    finally , we comment on the scenario where the dm particle is asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetric dark matter has been proposed in order to understand why the baryonic matter and dm have similar relic densities  @xcite . in such scenario , due to the lack of its antiparticle , the dark matter can not annihilate as they are accumulated inside the sun .",
    "if this happens , it is more difficult to have indirect detection signal of the asymmetric dm if it is completely stable and the above indirect detection bounds from the sun will no longer hold .",
    "however , if the dark matter self interaction is strong enough , the self capture could still play important roles and reveal its existence  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we studied the capture of low mass isospin - violating dm in the sun and the corresponding neutrinos flux from their subsequent annihilation .",
    "low mass isospin - violating dark matter has been proposed to reconcile the annual modulation signals observed by dama and cogent with the constraints put by the null direct - detection experiments .",
    "the isospin - violating effects make the scattering cross section of dm off certain isotope relatively suppressed , which therefore helps to solve the contradiction between positive signals with the null experiments .",
    "however , we find that the indirect detection of neutrino signals through the neutrino telescope super - k sets stronger constraints on the dm - nucleon interactions and brings further tension to such explanation , if the dm particles annihilate into neutrino - rich final states , e.g. , tau leptons or bottom quarks .",
