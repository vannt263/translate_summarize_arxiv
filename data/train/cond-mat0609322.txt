    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "an appendix adapts the working of section  [ sec : sectors ] to a more general tiling problem .",
    "we represent each trimer as a set of three consecutive _ squares _ along a line , oriented horizontally or vertically . for each tiling of a two - dimensional plane by trimers ( fig .",
    "1 ) , one can define a configuration of a height model at the _ vertices _ of the square lattice , where the heights are two - dimensional vectors @xcite as follows :    choose two - dimensional vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that they satisfy the condition @xmath17 .",
    "a convenient choice is @xmath18 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "equivalently the vectors can be represented as complex numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the height @xmath23 at any site @xmath24 is an integer linear combination of basis vectors @xmath25 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the lattice edges are assumed to be oriented rightwards or upwards , and they are labeled with vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 periodically as shown in fig .  [ figure3](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the labeling is such that moving along a horizontal or vertical line from any vertex up or right encounters a periodic sequence of labels @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this rule still leaves some freedom in choosing the sequence of bonds ; two convenient choices are shown in figs .",
    "[ figure3](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "now , for any given tiling of the square lattice , the height field @xmath26 is defined so that if the directed edge @xmath27 from site @xmath28 to the site @xmath29 does not belong to the interior of a tile ( i.e. , it forms part of the boundary shared by two tiles ) , and it has label @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .",
    "this determines the heights at all vertices up to an unimportant additive constant .",
    "the constant can be fixed by arbitrarily choosing @xmath32 .",
    "note that for the two choices of edge - weights shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the height difference along any edge of trimer has modulus @xmath33 . for ( a ) , it value is @xmath34 or @xmath35 for the internal edges of trimers , and for the choice ( b ) , it only takes the value @xmath34 .",
    "an example of the values of the height field following the convention ( a ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) for a particular configuration of trimers .",
    "the choice ( a ) has a particular advantage .",
    "it can be shown that any trimer covering of a plane can be obtained from any other by a sequence of the basic flip operation , in which three adjacent horizontal trimers are replaced by three adjacent vertical ones ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) . under a basic flip move , it is easy to check that the height changes only at four sites and the modulus of the change in height @xmath36 is always @xmath37 .",
    "we can think of the values of the height field as forming a triangular lattice on the complex plane .",
    "this lattice can be broken into @xmath38 sublattices ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) , such that even after any such flip , the value of height stays on the same sublattice .",
    "also , different sublattices of the height field are in one - to - one correspondence with a @xmath38 sublattice decomposition of the original square lattice ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "superlattice decomposition of the square lattice into 9 sublattices .",
    "( b ) height variables corresponding to a tiling of the square lattice form a triangular lattice . ]",
    "in this section we consider the geometry where the square lattice has been wrapped on a cylinder of circumference @xmath0 .",
    "the fully - packing constraint on the trimer tilings then implies strong constraints on the different configurations of trimers along a row of length @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , given some local configuration along a row , many local configurations along a different row are disallowed .",
    "if we think of the row - to - row transfer matrix as an trimer evolution operator for configurations on a line these constraints can be described in terms of some constants of motion under this evolution .",
    "the simplest constant of motion of this type can be constructed in terms of the invariants for loops @xcite . given a trimer tiling ,",
    "define an allowed loop as a sequence of nearest neighbor bonds on the lattice that returns to the starting point , and does not intersect itself , and none of the steps crosses a trimer .",
    "in other words , an allowed loop goes along the boundaries of trimers .",
    "define @xmath39 as the group generated by two generators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which satisfy @xmath40 now we attach weights ( elements from the group @xmath39 ) to each step of the loop .",
    "these read respectively @xmath28 , @xmath41 , @xmath29 , and @xmath42 for a step of the loop to the right , to the left , up , and down .",
    "finally , to each loop @xmath4 we assign a weight @xmath43 as the ordered product of the weights attached to the steps along the loop .",
    "( [ groupg ] ) imply that @xmath44 does not depend on the way ( starting point and direction ) in which the loop @xmath4 is traversed when building up the product weight .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that for a non - winding loop ( i.e. , an allowed loop on the cylinder which is homotopic to a point ) , @xmath44 is equal to identity .",
    "( the proof goes by induction on the number of trimers enclosed by the loop . )",
    "also , @xmath44 takes the same value for any allowed loop that winds around the cylinder .",
    "indeed , let @xmath4 be such a loop .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath44 does not change if the loop is deformed locally so that the number of trimers below it changes by @xmath45 . thus , @xmath44 is a constant for the tiling .",
    "however , given two products @xmath44 and @xmath46 of the generators @xmath47 , @xmath48 , checking whether @xmath49 by using the rules ( [ groupg ] ) is nontrivial .",
    "we now describe a different construction that is equivalent to this , but more convenient to use .",
    "[ figure6 ] shows a partial tiling of the plane , starting from a base ( shown hatched in the figure ) .",
    "each trimer occupies three horizontally or vertically consecutive squares .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal ( @xmath50 ) direction are assumed .",
    "the base is supposed without overhangs , and can therefore be specified by its height profile , @xmath51 .",
    "the only constraints about the partial tiling we assume is that it has no holes , and no overhangs . in particular , the tiled region",
    "can also be described by a height profile @xmath52 .",
    "we now construct an invariant of the tiling as follows .",

    "for example , the word characterizing the partial tiling in fig .  [ figure6 ] reads @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly to this word , we construct a functional of @xmath52 , denoted by @xmath71 , which is defined as the trace of a product of matrices @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where each factor is obtained from a letter in the word by replacing @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "we can therefore write @xmath76 .",
    "we now have the remarkable theorem : @xmath77 in other words , _",
    "@xmath78 is the same for all valid partial tilings , grown from the same base , and is equal to its value for the base .",
    "_    the proof is by induction on the number of trimers in the tiling .",
    "it is clearly true for no trimers .",
    "if we add a vertical trimer at @xmath50 , the height increases by @xmath79 , and the letter @xmath68 does not change .",
    "if we add a horizontal trimer , it must be done on a locally flat substrate .",
    "then in the word , the substring @xmath80 may be replaced by @xmath81 , or @xmath81 by @xmath82 , or @xmath82 by @xmath80 .",

    "our previous invariant is @xmath94 .",
    "however , the invariants @xmath95 are not all independent , as can easily be inferred from the simple example when @xmath96 corresponds to @xmath97 ; and there is then only one possible trimer tiling which completely fixes the values of all other loop variables .",
