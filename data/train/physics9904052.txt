    "2    we have had a reasonably complete picture of the bacterial light - harvesting ( lh ) system recently  @xcite . both the inner antenna , lh1 , and the outer antenna , lh2 , are assembled from the same modules to form rings .",
    "each module consists of two short @xmath0-helical polypeptides coordinate one carotenoid and three bacteriochlorophylls ( bchls ) .",
    "the lh2 is composed of 9 units , for _ rhodopseudomonas acidophila _",
    "@xcite , resemble a cylinder , with an inner diameter @xmath1 and an outer diameter @xmath2 , while the lh1 is composed of 16 units , for _ rhodospirillum rubrum _  @xcite , in order to accommodate the reaction center ( rc ) .",
    "the later has an outer diameter @xmath3 and a central diameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , the exact numbers of both complexes are variable  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lh2 b850 bchl @xmath4 form a complete over - lapping ring in a hydrophobic environment , which reduces the dielectric constant , while the b800 bchl @xmath4 are well separated and are in a polar environment .",
    "when a bchl molecule is excited by light , the energy can reach equilibrium within about @xmath5  @xcite . a lh2 can function as a storage ring to store the excited singlet state energy for about @xmath6 .",
    "however , the energy will transfer to other rings before decaying .",
    "the hopping of energy continues from one ring to another one until a lh1 , which contains the rc , is finally reached .",
    "the total trip lasts for about @xmath7 to @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "apparently , there is a competition between energy relaxation and energy transfer .",
    "historically , relatively few physicists have tackled problems of photosynthesis .",
    "notably , montroll used random walk concepts to model energy transfer amongst antenna rings on a lattice by considering its first passage time  @xcite .",
    "later , hemenger _",
    "proposed a more realistic model by taking inhomogeneous transfer rates and trapping of rcs into account  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is pearlstein s work which is most often cited in the literature  @xcite . in the mean time ,",
    "almost all experimentalists try to find some explanations for their spectral data . however , due to lack of precise geometrical information most efforts are in vain .",
    "progresses in physics are often made along the line structures - energy - dynamics .",
    "a goal of researches nowadays is to find the relation between structural and spectral information obtained , expecting that the function of photosynthesis will be explained in terms of its structure , and further drawing inferences from the model by applying methods of mathematical or numerical analysis .",
    "recently timpmann _ et al .",
    "_ used a rate equation model to describe energy trapping and detrapping by the rc  @xcite . however , their antenna has no structure .",
    "_ also carried out a series of investigation by analyzing the spectrum of a more realistic lh1 model  @xcite .",
    "however , their model is incompatible with the recent structural finding . in this paper",
    "we established a two - parameter model based on recent structural data .",
    "with the known periodical structure , shown in fig.[lh1 ] , we can built , from chemical rate equation , the following phenomenological model of energy transfer , @xmath9 in which @xmath10s denote the excited bchl dimer , @xmath11 is the excited state , with b representing the chlorophyll monomer within the rc , and @xmath12 is the excited special pair of bchl molecules .",
    "it is a set of 17 coupled linear differential equations .",
    "the symmetry of this system is broken due to @xmath13 .",
    "a similar model has been proposed by skla _",
    "et al . _",
    "however , the rc and the antenna ring are connected only at one site in the present model , corresponding to the recent experimental observation .",
    "=    in the homogeneous case with the same transition rate amongst the units , the characteristic polynomial of the above rate - constant - matrix can always be expressed as @xmath14 with @xmath15 which is a consequence of the master equation used , and is independent of the detail geometrical symmetry .",
    "the mode controlling the decay to the rc is within @xmath16 , since @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 do not contain @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , all four parts will be influenced by the change of @xmath23 .",
    "if one solves this set of differential equations by applying the laplace transformation method , one finds the solution divides into four distinct groups of decay channels , namely , @xmath24-@xmath25 ; e-@xmath26-@xmath27 ; @xmath28-@xmath29-@xmath30-@xmath31 ; @xmath32-@xmath33-@xmath34-@xmath35-@xmath36-@xmath37-@xmath38-@xmath39 .",
    "because the matrix of rate constants is hermitian , all eigenvalues are negative .",
    "furthermore , no eigenvalues are degenerated , in contrast to skla s model which posses too high degree of symmetry  @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath40 does not results in additional factorizability although the symmetry of our model is restored . at @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath42 becomes @xmath43 it contains a zero eigenvalue , which signals the existence of a steady - state solution , as should be happened without the decay to the rc .",
    "degeneracy of eigenvalues is introduced as the transition to the rc is decreased .",
    "2    we can verify our model against experiments : the pump - probe spectroscopy measures the difference between two beams , with @xmath44 being the signal measured .",
    "the symbol @xmath45s are the differences in dielectrical constants between pump and probe beams of the corresponding pigments . by choosing the pump and probe laser frequencies , we can selectively detect the population changes of @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "summing over eq .",
    "( [ m1])-([m4 ] ) we know that the decay of the total population should be @xmath48 .",
    "the measured charge separation rate is @xmath49 at room temperature , and increases by @xmath50 to @xmath51 times from @xmath52 to @xmath53 depending on the species chosen  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the forward and backward transition to the rc is know to be about @xmath54  @xcite for an open rc , i.e. , the rc bchl dimer ( p ) is reduced and the iron quinone electron acceptor is oxidized ; @xmath55 for pre - reduced rc .",
    "the back - trapping rate can , in principle , be estimated from @xmath56 , with @xmath57 the free - energy gap between @xmath26 and @xmath47 is estimated from their absorption peaks , @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath59 is the absolute temperature .",
    "however , the measured absorption peaks of the excited rc are broad and imprecise@xcite",
    ". we do not know the absolute values of @xmath20 or @xmath21 experimentally since it is difficult to tune the laser frequency to distinguish @xmath10 from @xmath47 . nor do we know the transition rate between @xmath10s because transition between the same species can not be measured directly . furthermore , at room temperature , energy equilibrium within the antenna interferes with the trapping process .",
    "therefore we have taken @xmath23 and @xmath20 as parameters and fit the slow mode of fluorescence decay of excited population observed , i.e. @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "thus , the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue should be about @xmath61 .",
    "a computer code is written to scan all combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath20 , with @xmath62 , for the largest eigenvalue to be smaller than @xmath63 between @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , we find all possibility happened at @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath62 .",
    "presumably , it is an extremum of @xmath16 . at the lowest @xmath23",
    ", we can match the required @xmath60 decay whose curve is plotted at fig.[lh2 ] . if @xmath68 , we obtained @xmath69 .",
    "that @xmath23 has to be equal to @xmath20 might sound peculiar in view of the geometrical distance between @xmath26 and @xmath70 is less than the distance between @xmath70 and other @xmath10s @xcite .",
    "however , the species for donor and acceptors are different at these two cases . there are possibilities that the final hopping rate are still the same .",
    "the transfer of excitation energy requires coupling between the emitting molecule and the ground state molecule . at an intermolecular separation involved between @xmath71 to @xmath72 , long - range resonance transfer of electronic excitation arises from coupling between the transition dipoles of the donor and the acceptor , which is the fster theory  @xcite .",
    "since the bchl @xmath73 dipoles lie in the same plane , we have @xmath74 in which @xmath75 , measures transfer efficiency , is the fster radius .",
    "van grondelle gave @xmath76 for the bchl 875 to bchl 875 energy transfer and a fluorescence life time , @xmath77 , about @xmath78 or slightly higher  @xcite .",
    "if a putative separation distance between interacting bchl @xmath4 dimers @xmath79 is used  @xcite we obtain an estimation of @xmath80 .",
    "this number is about an order of magnitude higher than the value obtained from our model .",
    "however , the pairwise energy transfer is about @xmath81 according to our calculation  @xcite . on the other hand , from the value of @xmath23 obtained here , by fitting the @xmath60 decay as well as the @xmath77 , we estimated the fster radius to be @xmath82 .",
    "this result is consistent within our model since we assume only nearest neighbour transition .",
    "further , since we put the population at the antenna at @xmath83 for our calculation , the rising time is infinitely short , instead of having some instrumental limits as observed experimentally .",
    "although the light wave length is much larger than the ring size , the ring still might receive energy in localized form by energy transfer from other rings as the initial condition we used in fig.[lh2 ] .",
    "table i provides a list of all eigenvalues and corresponding amplitudes obtained from our model . from the table , we found that the largest eigenvalue mode is important , not only for its large separation from the other eigenvalues but also for its corresponding large amplitude ."
