    "the question of dividing scarce resources among multiple participants in a way that is fair has remained a pressing question that intrigued humans for a long time , be it for dividing land among citizens or allocating organizational resources to its members .",
    "the formal study of _ fair division _ as we know it started during world war ii with works of steinhaus , knaster and banach @xcite .",
    "much of the earlier work focused on one heterogeneous divisible good , i.e. the cake cutting problem  @xcite , while other models ( such as the problem of allocating multiple divisible or discrete goods ) and notions of fairness were studied later in a growing body of literature , which includes multiple academic books  @xcite .",
    "fair division has been recently studied in the computer science community , as problems in resource allocation and fair division in particular are arguably relevant in scenarios such as manufacturing and scheduling , airport traffic , and industrial procurement  @xcite .",
    "prominent examples of fair division models that surfaced recently in real scenarios include problem of allocating computational resources ( e.g. cpu , memory , bandwith ) among the users of a system  @xcite , or the problem of allocating university courses to students in a way that is fair and efficient .",
    "the latter motivated the introduction of a notion of fairness known as a - ceei  @xcite , which approximates the well known ideal notion of fairness from economics , the _ competitive equilibrium from equal incomes _  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ [ @xcite ] studied the complexity of a - ceei with pessimistic conclusions for general preferences .",
    "nevertheless , the a - ceei solution is used to allocate courses to students at the wharton business school at the university of pennsylvania .",
    "the largest body of the literature on fair division models for multiple divisible and indivisible goods , as well as cake cutting , focuses on additive valuations , which capture _ perfect substitutes _ , i.e. goods that can replace each other in consumption , such as pepsi and coca - cola .",
    "however , many real allocation problems have complementarities in the preferences to various degrees . for example , if the user of a computer system wants to run a specific task , they may need @xmath0 units of cpu and @xmath1 units of ram .",
    "it is not useful if the user gets only @xmath2 unit of cpu but @xmath3 or more units of ram  they simply can not run the task because cpu is a bottleneck resource in this case .",
    "an important scenario with complements is that of _ single minded _ valuations , where the agent values a particular bundle and nothing less , and anything extra does not add to the value .",
    "such valuations arise naturally , for example assembling a bike requires a set of parts , or an agent s computational task can finish if and only if it is allocated a required bundle of resource .",
    "the latter example represents basis for more complex models that take into account the dynamics over time . due to their immense applicability",
    ", there is an extensive body of literature on such single minded valuations in areas such as auctions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , however work on fair division with such valuations is largely missing .",
    "we study fair division among single minded agents for three main scenarios , namely multiple divisible goods , cake cutting , and discrete goods .",
    "our main solution concept  the `` competitive allocation from equal incomes '' ( caei)is inspired from market equilibria and implements fair outcomes through a pricing mechanism .",
    "the caei solution can be seen as a relaxation of the standard competitive equilibrium from equal incomes and is a more intuitive notion for discrete resources than the latter .",
    "however many of our results , most notably for multiple divisible goods , carry over to the competitive equilibrium from equal incomes solution .",
    "the caei solution concept is sandwiched between the competitive equilibrium from equal incomes and envy - freeness , and it prunes ( via the prices ) , the least desirable envy - free allocations .",
    "nevertheless , caei exists if and only if envy - free allocations exist in all the fair division models we consider .    for multiple divisible goods and cake cutting",
    "we show existence of caei , while for discrete goods we give a succinct characterization of instances that admit this solution ; then we give an efficient algorithm to find one in all cases . maximizing social welfare turns out to be np - hard in general , however we obtain efficient algorithms for a number of settings , ( i ) divisible and discrete goods when the number of different _ types _ of agents is a constant , ( ii ) cake cutting with contiguous demands , for which we establish an interesting connection with interval scheduling , and ( iii ) cake cutting with constant number of agents .",
    "our results also carry over to valuation models where the agents have a desired target set ( e.g. the set of parts of a bike ) , while having very small positive value ( @xmath4 ) for any bundle that does not contain their desired set . for such scenarios ( which are compatible with experimental evidence that people like to accumulate `` stuff '' , even if unneeded )",
    ", the solution computed is an @xmath4-caei .",
    "we begin by presenting the model and solution concept for the most general setting .",
    "let @xmath5 be a set of agents and @xmath6 a set of resources , where @xmath6 is a compact subset of a euclidean space .",
    "each agent @xmath7 is equipped with a valuation function @xmath8 over the resources , such that for each subset @xmath9 , @xmath10 represents the valuation of agent @xmath7 for bundle @xmath11 .",
    "the goal is to allocate the resources among the agents in a way that is fair .",
    "agent @xmath7 is said to be _ single minded _ if there exists a bundle @xmath12 that @xmath7 can not be happy without ; that is , for any other bundle @xmath9 we have that @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "an _ allocation _",
    "@xmath16 is a partition of the set @xmath6 of resources such that @xmath17 is the bundle received by agent @xmath7 , the bundles are not intersecting and add up to the whole space .    our solution concept  the `` competitive allocation from equal incomes '' ( caei)is inspired from market equilibria and implements fair outcomes through a pricing mechanism .",
    "more formally , each agent is given an artificial unit of currency by the center .",
    "it can be used to acquire goods , and has no intrinsic value .",
    "the agent wants to spend its budget to acquire a bundle of items that maximizes its utility .",
    "a caei outcome is defined as a tuple @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an allocation and @xmath20 is an integrable , non - negative price density function , such that for each subset @xmath21 , @xmath22    formally , a tuple @xmath23 is a caei solution if and only if :    * for all @xmath24 , @xmath25 maximizes agent @xmath7 s utility given prices @xmath26 and its unit budget . * all the resources are allocated : @xmath27 . *",
    "no agent overspends : @xmath28 for all @xmath24 .",
    "the difference between the caei solution and the classical notion of a competitive equilibrium from equal incomes ( ceei ) , is that under ceei , the agents are additionally required to spend all of their budget . since we are in a fair division setting , neither the center nor the agents have value for the units of currency , thus the requirement of spending all the budgets can be relaxed naturally .",
    "moreover , in several of the scenarios we study , the ceei solution is not as tractable due to discontinuity of the valuations and/or discrete goods .",
    "crucially , every caei allocation is envy - free , since if an agent envied another agent s bundle it could just buy it instead , as the endowments are equal ; the prices provide a mechanism for indicating the interest level in the different resources . however , since the valuations are discontinuous , caei outcomes are not necessarily efficient , and so our aim will be to compute caei allocations with improved welfare guarantees .",
    "the _ social welfare _ of an allocation @xmath19 is the sum of utilities of all the agents : @xmath29 .",
    "we now formalize the model with multiple divisible goods and single minded agents .",
    "there is a set @xmath30 of agents and a set @xmath31 of goods . without loss of generality ,",
    "each good comes in one unit that is infinitely divisible .",
    "each agent @xmath7 demands a bundle @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] denotes the fraction required by agent @xmath7 from good @xmath34 .",
    "the utility of agent @xmath7 for a bundle @xmath35^{m}$ ] is @xmath36 if @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "since every part of a good is equally valued by agents , it suffices to specify its per unit price , _",
    "@xmath40 for good @xmath34 .",
    "we first show that the caei solution is guaranteed to exist for multiple divisible goods with single minded valuations , and can moreover be computed in polynomial time . in order to prove this",
    ", we must introduce the _ fisher market _ model , which is a classical model of an economy developed by fisher  @xcite .    a _ fisher market _ @xmath41 consists of a set @xmath5 of buyers ( agents ) and a set @xmath31 of divisible goods ( items ) .",
    "every buyer @xmath7 has :    * an initial budget @xmath42 , which can be viewed as some currency that can be used to acquire goods but has no intrinsic value to the buyer , and * a utility function @xmath43^m \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r}$ ] that maps a quantity vector of the @xmath44 items to a real value .",
    "@xmath45 represents the buyer s utility when receiving @xmath25 amount of the items .    without loss of generality",
    ", the supply of each good is assumed to be one unit .",
    "a standard type of valuations is known as _ leontief _",
    ", where the utility of a buyer @xmath7 for a bundle @xmath25 is : @xmath46 } \\left\\ { \\frac{x_{ij}}{v_{ij } } \\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath47 is the coefficient that describes buyer @xmath7 s valuation for good @xmath34 . thus buyers with leontief utilities",
    "desire the goods in the same ratios ( e.g. in the case of two goods  cpu and ram  a buyer with coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , will require @xmath1 more units of cpu for every additional unit of ram ) .",
    "each buyer in the market wants to spend its entire budget to acquire a bundle of items that maximizes its utility .",
    "a market outcome is defined as a tuple @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a vector of prices for the @xmath44 items and @xmath16 is an allocation of the @xmath44 items , with @xmath50 denoting the price of item @xmath34 and @xmath51 representing the amount of item @xmath34 received by buyer @xmath7 . a market outcome that maximizes the utility of each buyer subject to its budget constraint and clears the market",
    "is called a _ market equilibrium _  @xcite .",
    "formally , @xmath52 is a market equilibrium if and only if :    1 .",
    "optimal bundle : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 2 .",
    "market clearing : each good is fully sold or has price zero , i.e. , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and equality holds if @xmath58 .",
    "each buyer exhausts all its budget , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "a market equilibrium is guaranteed to exist for very general valuations  @xcite . for leontief utilities",
    ", it can be computed using the eisenberg - gale ( eg ) convex program formulations that follows .",
    "@xmath60    we can now show the existence and computation of the caei solution for single minded agents .    [",
    "thm : existence_divisible ] given a fair division problem with multiple divisible goods and single minded agents , a caei solution is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time .    given a fair division problem @xmath61",
    ", we consider a fisher market where the set of buyers is @xmath62 and the set of items is @xmath63 .",
    "each buyer @xmath7 has budget @xmath64 and _ leontief utility _ described by the vector @xmath65 , i.e. for any bundle @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 recall that fisher markets with leontief utilities always have exact market equilibria .",
    "let @xmath68 be any such equilibrium , where @xmath69 is the fraction received by agent @xmath7 from good @xmath34 and @xmath50 is the price of good @xmath34 .",
    "denote the leontief utility of buyer @xmath7 in the market by @xmath70 .",
    "we argue the market equilibrium @xmath68 is a caei solution for the fair division problem with single minded agents . to this end",
    ", we must show that all the items are allocated , each agent spends no more than a unit , and gets in exchange an optimal bundle at those prices .",
    "clearly the first two requirements are met since @xmath71 is a market equilibrium in the fisher market with identical budgets .",
    "we additionally show that each agent gets an optimal bundle in the fair division problem . for every agent @xmath7 , if the allocation @xmath19 satisfies the property that @xmath72 for all @xmath73 , then @xmath74 and @xmath7 gets its demand at these prices .",
    "otherwise , there is an item @xmath75 with @xmath76 but @xmath77 ; then agent @xmath7 does not get its demand , thus @xmath78 . since @xmath68 is a market equilibrium with respect to the leontief utilities given by @xmath79 , we have that @xmath80    assume by contradiction that in the fair division problem agent @xmath7 could afford its demand set at prices @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath81^{m}$ ] with @xmath82 @xmath56 , and @xmath83 . then in the fisher market with leontief utilities , buyer @xmath7 could also purchase bundle @xmath84 and get : @xmath85 which is a strict improvement over @xmath25 , contradicting that @xmath68 is a market equilibrium in the fisher market .",
    "thus the assumption was false and @xmath68 is a caei .",
    "finally , a fisher market equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time via a convex program formulation ( equation [ eq : me ] ; see codenotti and varadarajan @xcite for more details ) .",
    "as argued above , this algorithm can be used to compute a caei solution for single minded agents .",
    "as the next example illustrates , the solution computed in theorem  [ thm : existence_divisible ] is not necessarily optimal .",
    "consider 2 agents and 2 goods , where the demand of agent 1 is @xmath86 and of agent 2 is @xmath87 .",
    "the caei solution from theorem  [ thm : existence_divisible ] prices good 1 at @xmath88 and good 2 at @xmath89 , and the allocation splits good 2 equally between the two agents .",
    "this way agent 2 gets zero utility , while agent 1 gets utility 1 ( and some extra good that is of no use ) .    instead , another possible caei solution is to set prices @xmath90 , where agent 2 can now afford a quantity of 0.6 from good 2 , and agent 1 still gets its demand .",
    "thus the caei solution computed via the leontief market equilibrium is dominated by another caei solution with better welfare , which is not a solution to the program for leontief market equilibrium .",
    "we show that while maximizing social welfare is in general np - hard , the problem can be solved in polynomial time when the number of _ types _ of agents is constant .",
    "this allows handling possibly large numbers of agents when their demands fit some standard templates for resource requests .",

    "the observation underlying the algorithm is that agents of the same type must have identical utilities ( but not necessarily identical bundles ) .",

    "cake cutting models the problem of allocating a heterogeneous divisible resource , such as land , time , mineral deposits or computer memory , among agents with different preferences .",

    "@xcite studied fair division with additive valuations constrained by a minimum length requirement ( puml ) , @xcite studied externalities in cake cutting , while @xcite , studied cake cutting in two dimensions , where the agents also care about the shape of the pieces that they receive . in earlier work ,",

    "however , single minded valuations are discontinuous , and so their results do not directly imply ours .",

    "the case where each single minded agent requires a contiguous piece ( _ i.e. , _",

    "an instance of 3 agents with single minded valuations in cake cutting is illustrated in figure  [ pic : cake ] .",
    "we show that a caei solution always exists and can be computed efficiently in this model .",
    "a caei solution is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time in the cake cutting problem with single minded agents .    for each @xmath24 ,",

    "this gives a related allocation problem with @xmath44 indivisible goods and @xmath141 agents , where no agent has a demand set consisting of a single good .",

    "this can be accomplished by allocating the agents in the same name order that the greedy algorithm allocates the corresponding jobs , with the caveat that if multiple agents have the same finishing time , then the one with the _ latest _ starting time must be selected .",
    "the agents that intersect with the last scheduled agent will not get their demand set .    for each @xmath75-th agent that gets selected to receive their full demand , we select two very small intervals at the left and right endpoints of their demanded interval , respectively , and price them ( uniformly ) to sum up to @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "when there are no identical demands , the agents that do nt get served but for which there is an unallocated piece of their demand , can receive a small such piece ( at a total price of 1 ) ; otherwise , they get nothing ( but their demand now has the property that it costs more than 1 )",
    ". this allocation can be done so that the whole cake is divided .    then to handle identical agents ,",
    "the algorithm can be modified such that whenever selecting the earliest finishing time and finding multiple agents with the same finish _ and _ start time , then take a very small interval at the leftmost point of the unallocated cake and divide it equally among the identified identical agents , setting the price uniformly to sum up to their budgets . then iterate on the remaining cake .",
    "an example with four agents is given in figure 2 ; note that in this picture , for simplicity of presentation , the @xmath75th scheduled agent has the areas costing @xmath149 and @xmath150 distributed over its entire demand  this is allowed by the algorithm .",
    "however , generally one can select two arbitrarily small intervals ( prefix and suffix of agent @xmath75 s demand ) and only price these .        on the other hand , if the demands are not contiguous , then the problem of computing a welfare maximizing caei is np - hard .",

    "the idea is to try out every possible set @xmath165 of _ happy _ agents , who will receive their required land at a price of one , while the remaining agents split the remaining cake at prices so they can not afford their demand . then select the outcome that maximizes welfare among all choices of @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite in the context of computing welfare maximizing envy - free allocations for additive piecewise constant valuations .    given a cake cutting problem with single minded agents ,",
    "a welfare maximizing caei can be computed in polynomial time when the number of agents is constant .",
    "we first show that given a fixed set of agents @xmath165 , it can be checked in polynomial time if there exists a caei solution that makes all the agents in @xmath11 happy , and all the agents in @xmath166 unhappy .",

    "consider the following problem .",
    "let there be a cake cutting instance with agents @xmath174 and valuations such that the desired intervals are @xmath175 $ ] , @xmath176 $ ] , and @xmath177 $ ] .",

    "then agents @xmath2 and @xmath0 get precisely their demand , at a price of @xmath2 , while agent @xmath183 gets the empty set ; however this is feasible since agent @xmath183 can not do better  the price of its demand , @xmath184 , exceeds the agent s budget : @xmath185 . moreover ,",
    "this coincides with the optimal schedule from the interval scheduling problem , where the start and end times are @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , @xmath191 .",
    "clearly , this is not a ceei solution because agent @xmath183 does not exhaust its budget . instead",

    "this outcome is worse than the optimal schedule , supported at the welfare maximizing caei solution computed above .",
    "our setting for discrete goods is as follows .",
    "there is a set @xmath5 of agents and @xmath198 of items , where each item @xmath34 comes in @xmath199 indivisible copies .",
    "each agent @xmath7 has a demand set @xmath200 , and wants a copy of each item @xmath201 ; @xmath115 is not a multi - set . without loss of generality , we assume that each type of item is required by some agent .",
    "we illustrate the model with an example .",
    "there are agents @xmath202 , items @xmath203 , quantities @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and demands @xmath206 , @xmath207 .",
    "the goal is to find a set of prices for each item  such that every copy from the same item has an identical price  together with an allocation @xmath19 such that @xmath68 is a caei solution . in our example , a caei solution is attained at : @xmath208 and @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
    "note that similarly to the cake cutting problem , the caei solution is very different from ceei .",
    "in particular , there are instances  such as the one illustrated in the next example  where although there are enough items to go around to all the agents , the number of units is `` wrong '' , and so the prices can never be set so that all the budgets are exhausted .",
    "this provides additional motivation for studying the caei notion of fairness when allocating discrete goods .",

    "next we provide a succinct characterization of the instances that admit a caei solution . to this end , a useful notion will be that of _ over - demand_. we say that an item @xmath34 is over - demanded among a set of agents @xmath11 if the aggregate demand of the agents in @xmath11 exceeds the available supply from item @xmath34 , namely @xmath199 .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon in the next example .    consider a market @xmath41 with single minded agents and discrete goods , where @xmath212 , with quantities @xmath222 and @xmath223 , and agents @xmath224 , with demands : @xmath225 , @xmath226 .",
