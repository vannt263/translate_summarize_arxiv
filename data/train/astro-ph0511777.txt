    "recently , a number of _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton observations of quasars have shown local ( @xmath3 ) x - ray absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "these background quasars are among the brightest extragalactic x - ray sources in the sky and some of them were used as calibration targets .",
    "the typical high ionic column densities of these x - ray absorbers ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) imply the existence of large amounts of hot gas with temperatures around @xmath6 k. recent ultraviolet observations of the local high velocity absorbers also reveal such hot gas but at lower temperatures ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the spectral resolution of _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton , it is still unclear where this hot gas is located : in the interstellar medium , in the galactic halo , or in the local group as the intragroup medium .    in sharp contrast , so far only four targets were reported showing intervening absorption systems ( @xmath7 ) , all with low ion column densities .",
    "@xcite confirmed their first detection @xcite of an absorption system at @xmath8 , along the sight line towards pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "they found the observed column density is @xmath9 @xmath5 , and set a 3@xmath10 upper limit on the column density of @xmath11 @xmath5at the same redshift .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of two absorption systems along the sight line towards mkn  421 , but both systems showed absorption lines with column densities less than @xmath12 @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite reported a number of x - ray absorption systems towards h  1821 + 643 at 2 - 3 @xmath10 level , and @xcite reported the detection of an absorption line along the sight line towards 3c  120 .",
    "to understand the difference between the local and intervening absorption systems , we conduct a survey of a number of extragalactic targets observed with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton to search for local x - ray absorption lines . in this paper , we report the result of this survey .",
    "we find that a model in which local x - ray absorbers are associated with the milky way can explain our survey results better than a model in which they are associated with the intragroup medium in the local group .",
    "recently , @xcite conducted a systematic survey of 15 nearby agns to investigate the hot x - ray absorbing gas in the vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "while their work mainly focuses on associating individual line of sight with known local structures , our work is different in that we study the generic properties of this hot gas .",
    "all the background sources are selected from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton data archives .",
    "we focus on instruments that can provide both high spectral resolution and moderate collecting area in the soft x - ray band , and this results in four different instrument combinations : ( 1 ) rgs , the reflection grating spectrometer ; ( 2 ) letg ( the low energy transmission grating ) + hrc ( the high resolution camera ) ; ( 3 ) letg + acis ( the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ) ; and ( 4 ) hetg ( the high energy transmission grating ) + acis .",
    "the first one ( rgs ) is on board _ xmm_-newton and the last three are instruments on board _ chandra_. the instrumental resolving power is typically characterized by the line response function ( lrf ) , the underlying probability distribution of a monochromatic source .",
    "hetg - acis has the highest resolving power : the lrf of the medium energy grating ( meg ) has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath13  around 20  .",
    "the other three combinations have a roughly constant resolution of @xmath14 across the relevant wavelength range . in some cases ,",
    "a target has been observed with several different instrument configurations , and we select those that give the highest number of continuum counts .",
    "so far , nearly all the sources with local x - ray absorption lines show the detection of with high confidence , so in this paper we concentrate on the he@xmath1 resonance line with a rest wavelength of 21.6  . to ensure the significance of the absorption line",
    ", we select targets that have a strong continuum between 21 and 23  .",
    "specifically , we bin the spectrum to roughly half of the lrf fwhm and select targets which have at least 10 counts per bin around 21.6  . in this way",
    ", we can ensure a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of at least 4 within the lrf .",
    "we test with other binning size and find essentially similar results .    both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton data are analyzed using standard software , i.e. , ciao 3.1 and sas 6.0 .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for detailed data analysis procedures .",
    "the local he@xmath1 absorption lines from 8 of our 20 targets targets have been reported previously by other papers ; however , to ensure consistency in our data analysis , we re - analyze all the data sets and fit the absorption lines to obtain the equivalent width ( ew ) independently ( see column 5 of table  1 ) , and we refer the readers to the references we list in the column 7 of table  1 for spectra of detected lines . due to the complex nature of the sources in our sample and possible residual calibration effects , instead of fitting the continuum with a physically meaningful model such as an absorbed power law",
    ", we fit the continuum between 21 and 23  with a polynomial of an order between 3 to 5 , to effectively remove residual feature on scales @xmath15  .",
    "the residual is then fitted with a gaussian at @xmath16  , using isis ( interactive spectral interpretation system , see @xcite ) .",
    "while in all cases we confirm the detections ( and non - detections ) that were reported by the original authors , in some cases our measured ews are smaller than those originally reported .",
    "for example , we obtain an ew of @xmath17 m  for ngc  4593 , while @xcite report a much larger value , @xmath18 m.a careful reexamination of both data analysis procedures indicates that the main discrepancy comes from the determination of the continuum level ( steenbrugge , private communication . ) nevertheless , our method is more stringent and the measured ews can be taken as conservative lower limits .",
    "some of the sources in our sample are known to have intrinsic warm absorbers .",
    "one may worry that the absorption lines detected at 21.6   could be associated with the intrinsic warm absorbers , particularly in the case of ngc  3783 where may account for part of the absorption @xcite .",
    "however , this does not have a significant impact on our conclusions .",
    "our case - by - case study of all the warm - absorbers in our sample indicates that and are the only possible sources of confusion . is unlikely because except in ngc  4051 , none of the known warm - absorbers show the outflow velocities that can compensate their redshifts . for",
    ", our study indicates that always co - exists with but with at least @xmath19 times higher column density , so a non - detection of or a detection of with column density lower than @xmath20 @xmath5would simply rule out the presence of . by looking at each case",
    ", we find that can have a contribution only for ngc  3783 and mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "while can contribute at most part of the 21.6 line in ngc  3783 , the contribution to mcg6 - 30 - 15 is unknown yet . to be conservative",
    ", we therefore consider a subsample that excludes ngc  3783 and mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the sight line to 3c  273 extends into the galactic halo through the edges of radio loops i and iv , which have been attributed to supernova remnants ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that the contribution to the column density from the supernova remnants accounts for at most 50% of the observed equivalent length .",
    "if the absorption line is unsaturated , the equivalent width of the he@xmath1 absorption line can be converted to a column density by @xcite @xmath21 however , saturation could be an important issue , as revealed by high - order transition lines discovered in the mkn  421 spectrum @xcite , the highest quality spectrum in our sample . in that case",
    ", the column density of , determined by high - order transition lines is @xmath22 @xmath5 , more than five times higher than that estimated from eq.([eq : n ] ) . with this consideration , column densities converted from eq .",
    "(  [ eq : n ] ) can serve as conservative lower limits , and we adopt @xmath23 as a fiducial value in the following discussion for simplicity .    in figure  [ f1 ]",
    "we show an all - sky projection of the entire sample in our survey .",
    "the green dots show the positions of those targets with detections , and the red dots show the positions of those without detections .",
    "we wish to estimate the fraction of the sky covered by gas with an equivalent width of at least ew , @xmath24 .",
    "the difficulty we face is that we have a limited sample size , and not all sources in our sample have enough counts to permit detection of an absorption line of equivalent width ew . for each source",
    ", we define the threshold equivalent width , @xmath25 , which is the minimum equivalent width that can be detected at 3@xmath10 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is wavelength , @xmath28 is the photon flux , @xmath29 is the area of the detector , @xmath30 is the observation time , and @xmath31 is the resolving power where @xmath32 is the width of a resolution element .",
    "@xmath25 therefore depends on both the detector and the source ; as more data are gathered for a given source , its value of @xmath25 will decrease .",
    "table 1 includes values of @xmath25 for each source in our sample .    to estimate @xmath24 , we consider all the sources with @xmath33 , since only these sources have enough counts to ensure detection of an absorption system with an equivalent width @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the number of these sources , and let @xmath36 be the number of sources in this sample with detectable ovii absorption ( by definition , such sources must have @xmath37 ) .",
    "the detection fraction is then @xmath38 and in the limit of large @xmath36 it will approach @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the detection fraction as a function of the minimum detectable equivalent width , and the error bars are the standard 1@xmath10 errors for a binomial distribution .",
    "we show the error bars for the entire sample only for demonstration purposes .",
    "the detection fraction starts at @xmath3910% for the entire sample and @xmath39 5% for the subsample , corresponding to lines with @xmath40  m , and then gradually increases to 100% with increasing continuum level or decreasing ew threshold .",
    "the most striking feature is that the detection fraction approaches 100% as the sensitivity approaches @xmath41 m , which occurs at a continuum level of @xmath42 counts per bin . while it is tempting to infer that the detection fraction would be 100% if our sample had enough sensitivity , we must be cautious : given the detections of absorption lines in the five highest - quality data sets , we can conclude only that we have 90% confidence that the sky detection fraction is at least @xmath43 , or 63%",
    "while both _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton have unprecedented resolving power , the highest resolution we can achieve ( hetg - acis , in this case ) is about @xmath44 @xmath45 . based on the hubble flow and adopting a hubble constant of @xmath46 , this corresponds to a distance of @xmath47 mpc at @xmath48 , which makes it impossible to distinguish between a milky way - origin ( with a halo radius of @xmath49 mpc ) and a local group - origin ( with a radius of @xmath50 mpc ) for the x - ray absorbers .",
    "nevertheless , with such a large sample size , we can begin to understand the properties of these absorbers , i.e. , their size , density , temperature , spatial distribution , etc . in the previous section",
    ", we estimate the sky detection fraction @xmath51 of this hot gas .",
    "the detection fraction @xmath51 can be taken as an estimate of sky covering fraction , defined as @xmath52 .",
    "our estimation then indicates that the sky cover fraction is at least higher than 63% , and is likely close to unity . in the following ,",
    "based on this estimation we ( 1 ) calculate the expected number of absorbers along lines - of - sight toward distant agns , ( 2 ) make joint analysis with x - ray emission measurements , and ( 3 ) estimate the total baryonic mass .",
    "our calculation indicates that the observed x - ray absorbers are associated with our galaxy .",
    "given the high quality of spectra in our sample , any absorbers distributed between us and background agns with similar column densities , i.e. , @xmath53 @xmath5 , would be detected with high confidence .",
    "now let us estimate the expected number of _ intervening _ absorbers with a similar column density in our sample .",
    "a key assumption in our model is that the x - ray absorbers detected at @xmath48 are not unique , i.e. , an observer located in another galaxy similar to the milky way should be able to see similar x - ray absorption .",
    "the next step is to convert the covering fraction that we presented in the previous section to the detectability of these absorbers around systems similar to the milky way or the local group , along the sight lines towards background agns .",
    "we assume that the x - ray absorbers are uniformly distributed within the halo ( of a galaxy or a group of galaxies ) that has a radius @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the sky covering factor as observed from the center of the distribution of absorbers , which can be obtained from observation .",
    "if we view the absorbers in a different group of galaxies , the observed covering factor would be @xmath56 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . given the spatial density of the absorbers within the halo , we can then calculate the expected number of absorbers along the total line of sight towards all the background sources in our sample .",
    "if the spatial density of halos with radius @xmath54 is @xmath57 , the expected number is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cross section and @xmath60 is the cumulative distance along the sight lines to all the targets in the sample .    in reality , both the covering fraction and the available pathlength , and so @xmath61 , depend on the detection threshold @xmath25 .",
    "taking the covering fraction from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can calculate @xmath61 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , as a function of @xmath25 ( figure  [ f3 ] ) . let us consider two scenarios , in which the absorbers can be associated either with milky way - type halos or with local group - type halos .",
    "for the milky way - type halo , @xmath62 kpc , and the spatial density of halos is just the spatial density of @xmath63 galaxies , i.e. , @xmath64 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the observed local absorbers are associated with the local group , @xmath54 would be @xmath50 mpc .",
    "an integral over the press - schechter mass function @xcite from @xmath65 to @xmath66 gives a halo spatial density of @xmath67 . in figure",
    "[ f3 ] , local group case and the milky way case are represented by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "dark lines are for the entire sample , and red lines are for the subsample .",
    "given the fact that _ none of the targets in the sample show any intervening absorption with column densities even close to @xmath68 @xmath5 _ , clearly the observations are consistent with the association of the local x - ray absorbers with milky way - type halos , but inconsistent with a local group association .",
    "in the local group case , for the entire sample the maximum expected number of absorbers is @xmath69 if we take a threshold of @xmath70 m .",
    "the poisson probability of detecting zero if the expectation is 9.4 is just @xmath71 , at above gaussian @xmath72 level .",
    "if we take the subsample , the expected number decrease to @xmath73 , and the probability increases to @xmath74 , roughly corresponding to a gaussian @xmath72 level .",
    "we can also estimate the total baryon mass in these x - ray absorbers .",
    "let @xmath75 be the hydrogen density in an absorber and let @xmath76 be the volume filling factor of the absorbers in the halo .",
    "let @xmath77 be the typical hydrogen column density along lines of sight in which x - ray absorption is seen .",
    "averaged over the sky , the average column density is @xmath78 , so that the baryonic mass of the absorbers is @xmath79 , where @xmath80  g is the mass per h. let @xmath81 ( ) be the ionization fraction of and @xmath82 be the abundance of oxygen relative to the solar abundance ( taken as @xmath83  @xcite ) .",
    "we then have @xmath84\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the factor in brackets equals @xmath77 .",
    "if the absorbers were distributed throughout the local group so that @xmath85  mpc , their total mass would be @xmath86 ( ) ]  @xmath87 .",
    "since the dynamical mass of the local group is @xmath88 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the total baryon mass in the local group is @xmath89 for a baryon fraction of @xmath39 15% .",
    "this means the covering fraction at most can be 30% for solar metallicity . since figure  [ f2 ] clearly indicates that the covering fraction can be much higher ( and probably be as high as @xmath90 ) given enough instrumental sensitivity ,",
    "we conclude that a local group origin for these x - ray absorbers is unlikely because their estimated total mass would exceed the baryon mass of the local group .",
    "our conclusion is consistent with that of @xcite on the other hand , if we associate these absorbers with our galaxy , then the radius decreases by a factor of 10 - 100 and the total mass is substantially reduced .",
    "having presented evidence associating the @xmath91 x - ray absorbers with the hot gas within the milky way , we can further constrain the properties of the x - ray absorbers by assuming that the same absorbers are also responsible for at least some of the hot halo foreground observed in x - ray emission .",
    "the soft x - ray background is believed to be produced by three components : the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , the extragalactic background ( mainly from point sources ) , and a halo component . by analyzing _",
    "rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) data , @xcite concluded that the halo emission actually consists of two components , a hard component with @xmath92 and a soft component with @xmath93 . because the hard component is too hot to produce a substantial amount of in collisional ionization equilibrium",
    ", we assume that most of the observed resides in the soft component .",
    "let @xmath94 be the observed emission measure .",
    "since @xmath94 is based on solar abundances and is averaged over the sky , it is related to the actual emission measure , em , along a line of sight through an absorber by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the electron and proton densities .",
    "@xmath99 is the average pathlength through an absorber in pc .",
    "@xcite found an emission measure of @xmath100 for the soft component . from the absorption measurement , we have @xmath101 @xmath5 . since @xmath102 at @xmath93 , we have @xmath103 ( independent of metallicity ) , and @xmath104 kpc .",
    "this also provides independent evidence that these x - ray absorbers should be associated with our milky way instead of the intragroup medium in the local group .",
    "@xcite argued that based on a combination of emission line and absorption line measurement , the scale length of the o vii absorber should be at least @xmath105 kpc .",
    "however , their argument depended crucially on the temperature of the emitter / absorber",
    ". a shift in temperature by 0.1 to 0.2 in log space will change the scale length by a factor of 10 .",
    "they determined the temperature should be between @xmath106 k , based on the and line ratio . a recent work , based on much higher quality chandra data on mkn",
    "421 @xcite , indicated that just from chandra measurement of the and line ratio , the temperature of the mkn 421 local absorber must be lower than @xmath107 k. such a temperature brings the scale length down to the galactic scale .",
    "we estimate this x - ray absorbing gas has a density of a few @xmath108 with temperature around @xmath6 k. our estimations are consistent with values predicted from other models such as the dynamics of the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested , based on observations of absorption in the disk and halo of the milky way and in the intergalactic medium , that these absorption systems belong to radiative cooling flow of hot gas .",
    "their predicted column density is consistent with what we find in this paper .",
    "a key question then is : how to keep this gas hot without cooling ?",
    "for gas with such a high density , the cooling time will be less than the hubble time .",
    "in collisional ionization equilibrium , the typical cooling time scale is @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 . here",
    ", @xmath112 is the radiative cooling rate in units of @xmath113 . under the assumption that the cooling rate at @xmath114 scales as the fe abundance , the cooling rate of @xcite is @xmath115 , where the solar abundances are taken from @xcite . for the density and temperature",
    "we have estimated for the absorbers , the cooling time is much less than the hubble time , unless the metallicity is extremely low ( @xmath116 ) .    to keep this relatively dense gas ( @xmath117 @xmath118 ) at temperatures around @xmath6 k without cooling down over a hubble time scale ,",
    "some sort of heating mechanism must play an important role .",
    "supernova heating is a potential candidate .",
    "the cooling rate , according to the calculations above , would be @xmath119 for @xmath120 ; note that the dependence on @xmath55 , @xmath81(o  vii ) , and @xmath82 has canceled out . assuming that the supernova rate is about 0.02 yr@xmath121 in our galaxy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and that the energy output of each supernova explosion is about @xmath122 , the heating rate would be about @xmath123 . for @xmath124 kpc ,",
    "which is consistent with our estimate for @xmath125 , only a small fraction of the supernova energy is needed to maintain the temperature of the absorbers at @xmath126  k.    in this paper , we find that the sky covering fraction of this hot , -absorbing gas is at least 63% , at 90% confidence .",
    "this is based on the detections of absorption lines at @xmath127 level in the spectra of the top five high quality spectra . while we can not obtain the exact location of this hot gas within our galaxy , joint analysis with the x - ray background data",
    "indicates the scale height of this hot gas should be @xmath128 kpc .",
    "finally we conclude that , based on three independent estimations , the x - ray absorbing gas detected locally are part of the hot gas in our galaxy .",
