    "the hidden order problem in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is an unanswered question in the field of strongly correlated electron materials .",
    "although it is studied since several decades there is still no consensus about how this new phase forms .",
    "understanding the hidden order phase formation is not only an intellectual problem , it will also advance concepts for designing quantum materials with new exotic properties .",
    "many hidden order scenarios are based on the assumption of certain ground state symmetries and the present study addresses this aspect . a novel spectroscopic technique , non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nixs ) , that has become available thanks to high brilliance synchrotrons , allows to measure directly in a bulk sensitive experiment the symmetry of the 5@xmath1 ground state wave function in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .    in heavy fermion rare earth or actinide compounds , the @xmath1 electrons are well localized at high temperatures , but as temperature is lowered hybridization with conduction electrons becomes increasingly effective , resulting in a more itinerant @xmath1-electron character at low temperatures .",
    "these hybridized @xmath1 electrons form narrow bands and have large effective masses .",
    "quasiparticle interaction effects in these narrow bands are responsible for the many exciting phenomena present in heavy fermion compounds : multipolar order@xcite , unconventional superconductivity@xcite or quantum criticality@xcite .",

    "the @xmath7 order is replaced by an antiferromagnetic phase with large ordered moments ( so - called @xmath10-phase)@xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the @xmath7 phase has been subject of intense investigations since more than 30 years , but so far it remained hidden which has been the inspiration for its name . this second order transition into an electronically ordered state involves a reconstruction of the fermi surface@xcite and a change of quasiparticle scattering rate@xcite .",

    "the nixs experiment was performed at large momentum transfers ( see experimental set - up in section _ methods _ ) so that the signal is dominated by higher order scattering ( _ beyond dipole _ ) .",

    "all data shown are background corrected .",
    "before discussing the direction dependence , we first show in fig.[fig4 ] the isotropic data ( see section _ isotropic spectra _ in the appendix for construction of isotropic spectra ) together with a simulation using the ionic 5@xmath18 configuration for the u. we can clearly observe a very good agreement , thereby establishing that the spectrum is dominated by the atomic multiplet structure .",

    "perhaps more surprising is that a single ionic configuration can reproduce the spectrum so well despite the known covalency of the u. however , it has been explained by , for example , gunnarrson and schnhammer @xcite as well as degroot @xcite , that @xmath61 and @xmath62 core - level xas ( nixs ) for 4@xmath1/5@xmath1 and 3@xmath63 compounds , respectively , highlights the spectral weight of the energetically lowest lying ( and major ) configuration at the expense of those of the higher lying configurations , making the technique extremely powerful for determining the symmetry of the ground state ( see _ spectroscopy _ in the appendix ) .",

    "we compare the measured dichroism of about 35% ( see fig.[fig2](c ) ) with the simulated dichroism of the / wave functions in question . here",
    "the dichroism is defined as the difference of the intensities for * * @xmath49**@xmath50[100 ] and * * @xmath49**@xmath50[001 ] relative to the peak height r@xmath54 with r@xmath54 being the intensity difference of pre - edge at @xmath1290ev and peak height at @xmath1296ev of the isotropic spectrum ( see fig.4 , described in section _ appendix _ ) .",
    "we find that @xmath31(90/ ) ( or @xmath32(0/ ) ) and also @xmath6 reproduce the size of the anisotropy quite well , although their dichroism is with 43% or 50% slightly larger than the measured value .",

    "the @xmath34(90/ ) ( or @xmath33(0/ ) ) , i.e. the doublet states with the highest amount of @xmath3=@xmath68 , do not yield sufficient dichroism : the dichroism of 9% is by a factor four too small and would decrease further or even change sign with increasing amount of @xmath66 .",

    "also here the error bars reflect the statistical error .",
    "we find that within the error bars the 5k and 25k are identical .",
    "we further find that there is no change with temperature up to 300k as is demonstrated by plotting the dichroism for all temperatures in fig.[fig3](b ) .",
    "the boltzmann population with temperature of any state other than the @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) and @xmath6 state will change the direction dependence of the scattering ( compare fig.[fig2](a ) ) .",
    "hence we conclude from the absence of any changes in the spectra up to 300k that the ground state consists mainly of the @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) or the @xmath6 singlet , or that one of the two singlets forms the ground state with the respective other state close in energy .",
    "we can further estimate from the impact of thermal occupation that the states with weak dichroism like the @xmath34(90/ ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 must be higher than 150k ( 13mev ) while states with stronger opposite anisotropy must be even higher in energy .",
    "figure[fig3](c ) shows data taken within the plane , for * * @xmath49**@xmath50[100 ] and for two directions 22.5/ and 45/ towards [ 010 ] as well as the respective simulations for all cef states . neither below nor above the @xmath7 order transition",
    "we can resolve any anisotropy within the statistical error bar .",
    "this is not in contradiction with our previous findings that either one of the two singlet states @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) and @xmath6 forms the ground state since the asymmetries expected from simulations are rather small and most likely covered by statistics of this low count experiment .",
    "the in - plane data even confirm the out - of - plane data when comparing the measured and simulated shape of the spectra : for example , the peak at 94ev is clearly smaller than the peak at 97ev for the simulated @xmath31(90/ ) and @xmath6 spectra ( see gray lines in fig.[fig3](c ) ) in agreement with the data while the two peaks are about the same for all other states .",
    "for the in - plane simulation for different values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 we refer to fig.[fig6 ] ( see appendix ) .",
    "our results of a ground state that consists mainly of @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) and/or @xmath6 agree well with the description of the anisotropy of the static susceptibility@xcite and the analysis of the temperature dependence of the elastic constants@xcite which are well described with a @xmath31 of majority @xmath3=+4 and -4 , a @xmath6 as first excited state and another state above 150k .",
    "it also confirms dmft calculations that finds these two singlet states as low lying states close in energy ( see ref.@xcite and also in supplementary of kung _ _ et al.__@xcite ) but the experiment yields the additional information that the @xmath3=+4 and -4 in the @xmath2 is dominating .",
    "we further would like to stress that linear polarized xas data at the u @xmath21 edge@xcite also agree with our findings in the sense that both , the nixs _ and _ xas dichroism , rule out the @xmath32(90/ ) ( or @xmath31(0/ ) ) , the @xmath40 or the @xmath41 as possible ground states and find no temperature dependence across the @xmath7 transition . the smaller direction dependence that lets the authors of ref.@xcite",
    "assign the @xmath34 doublet as ground state might be due to the higher surface sensitivity of the xas experiment .",
    "a pure @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) or @xmath6 or both close in energy does confront us with the dilemma that neither would break the @xmath72 in - plane symmetry as suggested by the torque@xcite , high precision x - ray@xcite , and elastoresistance@xcite results nor would an ordering out of a singlet state yield sufficient loss of entropy across the @xmath7 transition . to allow for a rank-5 @xmath73 @xmath7 parameter as in the fully microscopic itinerant approach@xcite",
    "the inclusion of the twofold degenerate cef state of @xmath74-type is a necessity in the present more localized picture .",
    "also the interpretation of the resonance intensity in the main a@xmath75 and other raman channels in terms of a staggered chirality density wave requires a mixing of @xmath2 and @xmath6 singlet states that support a hexadecapole - type hidden order parameter .",
    "the model of kung _ et al .",
    "_ contains both dominant a@xmath75 and subdominant b@xmath76 symmetry parts .",
    "the latter involves higher energy cef states and couples to the lattice leading to a secondary orthorhombic distortion that leaves only twofold symmetry .",
    "this causes a leakage of resonance intensity into forbidden channels @xcite .",
    "our experiment shows that the cef components are mainly of the @xmath31(90/ ) or @xmath6 singlet type but we did not observe the theoretically maximum possible dichroism ( see fig.[fig2](c ) ) so that the data allow the presence of some other symmetry .",
    "the mixing of an irreducible representation , other than @xmath31(70/-90/-110/ ) or @xmath6 , into the ground state can not rely on boltzmann occupation since that would have been observable in the temperature dependence of the nixs data .",
    "however , a kondo - type mechanism where an @xmath48 kramers doublet hybridizes with the crystal - electric field manifold of the energetically more favorable @xmath77 configuration is feasible for constructing a ground state with different @xmath18 cef characters . here",
    "@xmath78 denotes an electron in the host conduction band .",
    "we recall that a hybridization gap of 13mev opens up below 27k@xcite which is also seen in the dmft calculation that includes these kondo processes@xcite .",
    "the stabilization energy of this kondoesque wave function should be of the same order as the hybridization gap and the contributing cef configurations should also be within this energy range .",
    "the bulk sensitive , u @xmath21 non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering data of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibit the atomic multiplet structure of the @xmath18 configuration .",
    "the huge out - of - plane anisotropy shows that the symmetry of the ground state consists mainly of the @xmath31(90/ ) or @xmath6 singlet states in the u@xmath17(@xmath18 ) configuration and/or that these two states are close in energy .",
    "the data do not exhibit any temperature dependence , neither across the @xmath7 phase transition nor in the temperature interval up to 300k , the latter setting constraints to the proximity of next higher excited states .",
    "scenarios for constructing a ground state that is a superposition of different irreducible representations without relying on boltzmann statistics are discussed .",
    "a high - quality single crystal of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 was grown with the traveling zone method in the two - mirror furnace in amsterdam under high purity ( 6n ) argon atmosphere .",
    "the crystal was checked and oriented with x - ray laue diffraction for its single - crystalline nature .",
    "the oriented crystal was cut using the spark erosion method after which the relevant surfaces [ ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 001 ) ] were polished .",

    "it turned out that specular geometry ( same path for photon in as for photon out ) is not necessary since @xmath49@xmath50[110 ] measured specular on the ( 110 ) crystal and 45/ off specular on the ( 100 ) crystal gave the same result .",

    "why does @xmath42-edge xas or nixs resemble the @xmath18 multiplet structure and why is @xmath42-edge xas or nixs sensitive to the symmetry ?",
    "the reason for this is that the energy order of the local configurations ( in a configuration interaction picture ) of the ground state problem and of the nixs / xas core - hole final state problem is identical .",
    "hence , the spectral weights of the other local configurations are strongly suppressed due to quantum mechanical interference effects .",
    "this is e.g. well explained by o. gunnarsson and k. schnhammer @xcite fig.7 for the case of ce @xmath80 xas and by de groot @xcite pages 549 and 550 for the case of 3@xmath63 transition metal @xmath81 xas . a quote from the latter : _ xps is sensitive to the charge transfer effects ........ while xas is sensitive to the symmetry of the ground state with its characteristic multiplet .",
    "_ it is important that the relevant intra- and inter - shell coulomb interactions are of similar size in order to have the same order of configuration energies in the ground state problem as well as core - hole final state problem : this is true for the ce @xmath80 ( 3@xmath63 , 4@xmath1 ) , u @xmath21 ( 5@xmath63 , 5@xmath1 ) , transition metal @xmath81 ( 2@xmath82,3@xmath63 ) edges , but not for e.g. the ce @xmath81 ( 2@xmath82,5@xmath63 with 4@xmath1 as spectator ) or u @xmath81 ( 2@xmath82,6@xmath63 with 5@xmath1 as spectator ) since here the coulomb interaction of 5@xmath63 - 4@xmath1 or 6@xmath63 - 5@xmath1 is negligible in comparison with the 2@xmath82 - 4@xmath1 and 4@xmath1 - 4@xmath1 or 2@xmath82 - 5@xmath1 and 4@xmath1 - 5@xmath1 , respectively . for further reading",
    "we refer to ref.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations include / coupling and coulomb interaction and are based on an ionic model with a u@xmath175@xmath18 configuration .",
    "the atomic values are calculated with the cowan code@xcite but the slater integrals for coulomb interactions are reduced by a constant factor to account for the screening of the moments in the solid .",
    "the 5@xmath15@xmath1 and 5@xmath635@xmath1 reduction was adjusted to about 50% to match the experimental energy spread of the multiplet signal of the isotropic data in fig.s1 ( for construction of isotropic spectrum see below ) .",
    "the ratio of multipole contributions was slightly adjusted by varying @xmath83@xcite . in the simulations the actual value for @xmath83 was slightly larger than according to the experimental scattering triangle because the radial part of the wave functions that enter the calculations are based on the atomic values .",
    "for all finite values of / coupling and coulomb interaction the @xmath24=4 multiplet forms the hund s rule ground state .",
    "the relative contributions of different angular momenta @xmath84=3,4,5 depend on the ratio of / coupling and coulomb interaction and are 1% , 14% , and 85% for our reduction factors , respectively .    within the @xmath24=4 basis",
    "we create the local eigenstates ( @xmath2 to @xmath85 ) restricted to the @xmath18 configuration by combining different states of @xmath3 considering the constraints by group theory .",
    "the hamiltonian includes the local spin - orbit coupling and multipolar coulomb interaction , which are much larger ( up to 1 rydberg ) than the final - state core - hole lifetime ( order of 1ev ) , but neglects the effects of crystal - field , covalent bonding and band - formation of the crystal , which will be smaller or of the same order of magnitude as the core - hole lifetime .",
    "the calculations are performed using the _ quanty _ code@xcite .    to account for instrumental resolution , lifetime effects , and interference effects with the continuum",
    "the multiplet lines are broadened with a gaussian ( fwhm=0.8ev ) , a lorentzian ( fwhm=1.3ev ) and a mahan - type line shape ( with an asymmetry factor 0.18 and an energy width of the continuum of 1000ev ) in order to mimic the asymmetry due to the itinerancy .",
    "the charge densities are calculated for two electrons .",
    "the surface thus tells how much charge can be found in a specific direction . for a system with one electron",
    "this would be a plot of the orbital that is occupied . for a system that can be represented by a single slater determinant it shows a `` sum '' of the different orbitals occupied .",
    "the color is related to the spin density with up as red , down as blue and zero as gray .    for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 often @xmath86 coupling",
    "is assumed whereby @xmath84 @xmath87 @xmath24 and @xmath3 are all good quantum numbers . doing so results in density plots with much more features than in the present manuscript .",
    "this assumption basically is equivalent to saying that @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 slater integrals are infinitely larger than the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "that approximation is not valid and spin - orbit coupling mixes states @xmath91 with states @xmath84 + 1 @xmath87 - 1 or @xmath84 - 1 @xmath87 + 1 .",
    "this mixing is included in our calculations .",
    "furthermore we know that both the multipole part of the coulomb interaction as well as the spin - orbit interaction are not ( not really ) screened in a solid .",
    "in other words the u 5@xmath1 shell in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is in - between @xmath91 and @xmath92 coupling and was taken in account .",
    "the isotropic spectrum is given by the trace of the conductivity tensor .",
    "for dipole transitions ( k=1 ) this tensor can be written as a 3x3 matrix with two independent diagonal elements in @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "however , for higher multipoles the conductivity tensor has also a higher dimension , i.e.  7x7 for octupole ( k=3 ) and 11x11 for dotriacontapole ( k=5 ) .",
    "here we obtain the _ experimental _ isotropic spectrum containing these three relevant conductivity tensors by combining 10 independently measured directions .",
    "the _ calculated _ isotropic spectrum is obtained by averaging over all cef states .",
    "the red line in fig.[fig4 ] is the simulation of the isotropic data after optimizing the respective parameters .",
