    "the aim of this paper is to construct a class of asymptotically flat solutions to the vacuum constraint equations of general relativity that are somewhat unusual , namely they contain a marginally outer trapped torus . in the case of time",

    "motivation for this work comes from two sources : while the question of the existence of a regular solution to the constraints is of physical and mathematical significance in itself , analysis of given initial data with respect to the existence and properties of minimal surfaces and apparent horizons has received some interest in the discussion on cosmic censorship .",
    "this work deals with the simplest situation where a toroidal minimal surface can be present , namely that of time - symmetry , axial symmetry and conformal flatness .",
    "the assumptions of time - symmetry and conformal flatness allow to use a conformal symmetry to turn the constraint from a partial differential equation ( pde ) to a set of uncoupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",

    "the use of the nag numerical fortran library @xcite yields an excellent documentation of all numerical routines that have been used .    another point in favor of the method",
    "is that it works well for strong data  that is near @xmath278 in our sequence , only the @xmath199 term in the fourier series blows up when the mass does .",
