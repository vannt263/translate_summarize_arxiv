    "aluminium monoxide ( alo ) is an interesting astronomical species whose spectrum is prominent in a new class of nova - stars first discovered by @xcite of which the most prominent examples are probably v838 mon and v4332 sgr @xcite .",
    "these two objects defined a new type of eruptive variables called intermediate luminosity red transients and the observational data showed the intense presence of the near - infrared a ",
    "x system of the alo radical .",
    "indeed this a  x band is also found to be fairly prominent in a variety of cool , oxygen rich stars @xcite : besides the mira variables discussed above alo emissions were also observed in the oh / ir stars and two bright infrared sources @xcite .",
    "transitions in the blue - green b  x system have been observed in sunspots @xcite and the red supergiant vy canis majoris @xcite , in which millimeter - wave rotational transitions have also been observed @xcite .",
    "finally , alo spectra have been used to try and determine abundance of the long - lived , radioactive @xmath4al isotope @xcite .",
    "terrestrially alo emissions arise from rocket exhausts in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "its spectrum is also extensively used in the laboratory to monitor alo in plasmas and other applications @xcite .",
    "these applications , combined with technological uses of alo spectra , have motivated a number of laboratory studies which have produced molecular constants characterising the lowest three states of alo @xmath5 , a@xmath6 and b@xmath7 .",
    "there have also been attempts to produce line lists .",
    "@xcite constructed a comprehensive line list for the x  b system for temperatures up to 6000  k but did not provide a transition dipole , so all their transition intensities are only relative . @xcite performed a combined analysis of the a x and b  x band systems involving 21  500 lines ; we compare with some of their results below .",
    "there is , however , no single line list that combines a comprehensive set of transition frequencies with an accurate model for the transition intensities .",
    "it is this that we aim to do here as part of the exomol project .",
    "exomol aims to provide line lists of spectroscopic transitions for key molecular species which are likely to be important in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and cool stars ; its aims , scope and methodology have been summarised by @xcite .",
    "line lists for @xmath8 xh molecules , x = be , mg , ca , have already been published @xcite , as well as for a number of closed - shell diatomics @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we present rotation - vibration transition lists and associated spectra for alo .",
    "these line lists are particulary comprehensive and should be valid for temperatures up to 8000 k.",
    "rotation - vibration line lists for the three lower electronic states of alo were obtained by direct solution of the nuclear motion schrdinger equation using program duo  @xcite .",
    "the calculations require both a potential energy curve ( pec ) for each of the three states considered and also couplings between these curves .",
    "these curves were taken from our previous study @xcite , which computed _ ab initio _ potential energies , spin - orbit and electronic angular momenta couplings , and refined them using available experimental data .",
    "nuclear motion calculations using these refined curves showed that the observed transition frequencies and energy levels could be reproduced with root mean square error of only 0.07 @xmath9 . in order to cover all vibrational excitations below 35,000  @xmath9",
    ", we have increased the sizes of the vibrational basis set to 90 for each of the x , a , and b states from those used by @xcite .",
    "the ranges of rotational excitations are listed in table  [ tab : lifetime ] .",
    "there appears to be no experimental measurements of any alo transition dipoles . for this reason we constructed new dipole moment curves ( dmc ) using high level _ ab initio _ calculations",
    "these are compared to previous , high - level _ ab initio _ determinations @xcite below .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations were performed using molpro @xcite ; we used multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) methods with different choices of basis sets .",
    "our optimal basis choice was aug - cc - pvqz ; the active space used in molpro representation was ( 9,4,4 ) .",
    "electronic dipole moments as function of bondlength , @xmath10 , were computed as the expectation value @xmath11 where the integral and the summation run over the electron coordinates , denoted by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the charge of the electron . for permanent dipole moments ,",
    "the electronic wavefunctions in the bra and ket are the same , ie @xmath14 , and the dipole moment , which is denoted @xmath15 below , also contains a term due to permanent nuclear charge . for transition dipole moments , @xmath16 , and the dipole is denoted is @xmath17 below . for transition dipole moments , care must be taken to ensure the that the dipole phases are consistent as a function of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our calculations produce the values for the dipole at equilibrium given in table  [ tab : dipol ] which compare well to the previous results obtained by @xcite .",
    "our ground state value of the dipole and that of @xcite are both slightly smaller than the value 4.60 d used in the jpl database @xcite which was taken from the earlier calculations of @xcite .",

    "we present comprehensive line lists for the four most important isotopologues of alo .",
    "these are based on the direct solution of the nuclear motion schrdinger equation using a potential energy curves and couplings obtained by fitting to extensive dataset of measured transitions .",
