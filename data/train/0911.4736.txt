    "confining gauge theories like qcd are extremely challenging .",
    "information based on first principles is only available at high space - like momenta , where perturbation theory is valid , while at low energies the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry allows a description in terms of an effective theory of pions known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .    in order to go beyond these two energy regimes , in the so - called resonance region , new genuinely non",
    "- perturbative techniques have to be employed . in this respect ,",
    "lattice qcd is probably the best - positioned candidate to eventually unravel non - perturbative physics , but even if this goal is accomplished , it should be complemented with analytical non - perturbative methods .    over the years",
    "many different methods have appeared to estimate non - perturbative parameters in qcd . among them ,",
    "the most popular are perhaps vector meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite , qcd sum rules ( qcdsr )  @xcite with all its variants  finite - energy sum rules ( fesr ) , borel sum rules ( bsr ) , etc. or the minimal hadronic approximation ( mha )  @xcite .    despite the differences between those approaches ,",
    "there is a common ground : they all adopt a meromorphic hadronic ansatz , _",
    "i.e. _ some modeling of the hadronic spectrum consisting of single poles",
    ". this can be connected to a well - defined limit of qcd , namely the limit of large number of colors  @xcite . in this limit",
    ", qcd looks like a topological field theory which admits a power expansion in the parameter @xmath6 . at leading order",
    ", any correlator is a meromorphic function .",
    "plenty of phenomenological features of qcd can be qualitatively understood by inspecting the leading order in the @xmath6 expansion  @xcite .",
    "however , a quantitative solution to large-@xmath7 qcd has proved elusive so far . in other words , the values for the ( infinite ) poles and",
    "their associated residues remain unknown . limit . ]    therefore , from this perspective , vmd , qcdsr and the mha may be seen as different phenomenological approximations to qcd@xmath8 .",
    "vmd assumes that , whenever vectors contribute to a certain process , the first vector resonance in the spectrum gives the bulk of the non - perturbative effects .",
    "a natural extension of vmd is lowest meson dominance ( lmd ) , which states that each channel is dominated by the lowest lying resonance .",
    "the problem is that very little is known about poles and residues of resonances .",
    "qcdsr , in contrast , is a method that allows to determine resonance parameters by matching the hadronic ansatz to the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the mha originated from a completely different context , namely the computation of electroweak observables , like the electromagnetic pion mass difference  @xcite , which can be expressed in general as integrals over the euclidean regime of qcd correlators .",
    "the mha also relies on a matching , but one typically matches to high _ and _ low energies .",
    "therefore , vmd has no matching , qcsr is a 1-point matching procedure and the mha a 2-point one .",
    "only recently it has been pointed out  @xcite that the previous methods are special cases of what is known in the mathematical community as rational approximants . essentially every method based on meromorphic anstze and local matching",
    "is a pad approximant : a pad - type if the poles are fixed to physical masses , a partial - pad if a subset of poles and residues is taken from experiment , or a plain pad approximant if no input other than matching is used .",
    "therefore , the mha is a 2-point pad - type approximant , fesr are 1-point pad - type approximants while bsr are 1-point borel - pad approximants .",
    "only vmd falls out of this category because there is no matching involved .",
    "there is one important remark to be made : the theory of pad approximants states clearly that the parameters that come out of matching ( poles and residues ) _ are not _ the physical ones , and only in certain cases can be identified as such . in fact , as we will see later on , it is not uncommmon that some of the mass - parameters become complex - valued . as a result ,",
    "a naive identification of pad parameters with physical ones should be avoided .",
    "an additional and closely related characteristic of pad approximants is that euclidean quantities are quite insensitive to the details of the hadronic ansatz .",
    "this was already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of mha , where it was shown that meromorphic correlators , which bear little resemblance to qcd in the physical axis , can nonetheless be made extremely accurate in the euclidean regime , _ provided _ the correlator complies with known properties of qcd at high and low energies .",
    "this was a direct consequence of the mha being a pad approximant , though at the time it was not fully realized .",
    "therefore , if one is interested in euclidean parameters there is no need to use hadronic input .",
    "in this paper i will explore the consequences of working with a minimal ( meromorphic ) ansatz for correlators constrained in a maximal way .",
    "this maximally - constrained approach differs from conventional mha in that not only the decay couplings but also the masses will be left free .",
    "thus , the method is none other than a plain pad approximant : all parameters of the interpolator will be determined using only information from euclidean space , with no reference to hadronic parameters whatsoever . in this work",
    "i will concentrate mostly on the two - point correlators @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the pad approximant will lead to definite relations between low and high energy parameters , allowing in particular to relate the chpt parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 to the dimension - six and dimension - eight vacuum condensates , or the magnetic susceptibility @xmath5 to the mixed and quark condensates .",
    "the structure of the paper will be as follows : in section  [ secii ] i will discuss the application of the method to the @xmath0 correlator and its implications for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 vacuum condensates .",
    "in section  [ seciii ] i make contact with the theory of pad approximants and show how the method is embedded in it . in section  [ seciv ]",
    "i extend the analysis to the @xmath1 correlator to give a prediction of the low energy parameter @xmath5 , the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate , in terms of the mixed condensate . in section  [ secv ]",
    "i briefly comment on the implications of this strategy for the scalar and tensor two - point functions . conclusions and future prospects",
    "are summarized in section  [ secvi ] .",
    "finally , i include an appendix with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 four - quark operators for the vector , scalar and tensor sectors together with their expressions in the factorization approximation .",
    "consider the following two - point correlators @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will define its difference as @xmath14 . in the chiral limit",
    ", lorentz and gauge invariance lead to @xmath15 this correlator has a lot of interesting properties .",
    "first of all , it is an order parameter of the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( s@xmath16sb ) . in particular",
    ", this means that it vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , all its high and low - energy coefficients are order parameters of s@xmath16sb too .",
    "second , its first two ope terms cancel on general grounds : gauge invariance forbids a @xmath17 condensate , while the @xmath18 operator is purely gluonic ( in the chiral limit ) and therefore chirally symmetric .",
    "this led to the celebrated superconvergence relations between hadronic parameters for the vector and axial channels  @xcite , nowadays known as weinberg sum rules .",
    "the high energy fall - off can therefore be cast as @xmath19 on the other hand , chpt allows to parameterize the low energy regime as @xmath20 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are low energy parameters , encoding the dynamics of the hadronic spectrum . ) and ( [ chiralv ] ) have a logarithmic dependence when quantum corrections are taken into account . in this paper",
    "i will always consider their leading - order scale - independent contribution . ]",
    "when the number of colors is large , any correlator is saturated by the exchange of an infinite number of stable one - particle states . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the absorptive part reads @xmath21 where we have defined @xmath22 @xmath0 satisfies an unsubtracted dispersion relation and therefore one can write @xmath23 if the previous expression is regarded as an interpolator of the true qcd correlator , then the unknown masses and decay couplings can be determined , for instance , by matching to the known ope expansion . in general , for an arbitrary large but finite spectrum , one finds the following set of matching equations @xmath24 whose solution determines the hadronic parameters in terms of vacuum expectation values of qcd operators .",
    "the previous system of equations was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where very interesting remarks were made on the relation between ope condensates and the pattern of vector and axial states in the spectrum of @xmath0 . in particular , the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ mat ] ) leads to a vandermonde - type linear system and can therefore be solved analytically .",
    "the results show that all ope condensates , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ opevector ] ) , should be positive .",
    "this complies with a theorem by witten  @xcite that states the following positivity condition : @xmath25 as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , witten s inequality in conjunction with the weinberg sum rules requires @xmath26 to be positive .",
    "note nonetheless that the conclusions reached in ref .",
    "@xcite hold if the masses in eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) are taken to be physical , _",
    "i.e. _ , if one is constructing a pad - type . however , as i discussed above , plain pad approximants do not impose such constraints and instead leave all masses and decay constants as free parameters . in the following",
    ", i will explore the consequences of analysing eqs .",
    "( [ mat ] ) as a plain pad .",
    "one of the main advantages of meromorphic approximants is that low and high energy parameters can be related analytically .",
    "following our discussion in the introduction , i will restrict my attention to the minimal number of states per channel , @xmath27 in order to fully determine masses and decay constants , we need to solve the following system of equations : @xmath28 which is a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) , where the first two equations are the celebrated weinberg sum rules . with the masses",
    "free , the previous system of equations becomes non - linear , and its solution becomes considerably involved .",
    "however , it is instructive to inspect the solution at a qualitative level .",
    "the first thing to notice is that there are actually two solutions , as a consequence of the symmetry @xmath29 , @xmath30 of the ansatz .",
    "the second and most relevant fact is that the parameters can become complex if @xmath31 imaginary solutions obviously invalidate any interpretation of the parameters as being physical .",
    "however , notice that this does not affect euclidean quantities .",

    "it is also significative that if @xmath47 is used , the values of the condensates for the first half of table  1 come out from eqs .",

    "systematics both due to quantum corrections and intrinsic to the nature of the rational approximation as an iterative method are expected to be dominant .",
    "their impact on the different parameters is difficult to estimate , but generically one should expect a 10 - 30% correction .",
    "at this point , let me come back to an issue i have mentioned but not discussed .",
    "so far all the quantities evaluated , namely chiral coefficients , vacuum condensates and even the pion electromagnetic mass difference , have been real , as one expects , yet the hadronic parameters from the ansatz , that one would naively identify with physical states , might become complex if the reality condition @xmath55 is not fulfilled .",
    "indeed , most of the values reported in the first half of table  i do not satisfy the reality condition , and yet they still comply with eq .",
    "( [ pred ] ) .",
    "euclidean quantities seem to be mysteriously protected .",
    "this is where the theory of pad approximants becomes useful . as i already mentioned in the introduction , almost the entire analytical techniques that deal with non - perturbative strong interactions",
    "can be formulated as different kinds of pad approximants to meromorphic functions .",
    "a pad approximant @xmath56 is the ratio between two polynomials , where the indices @xmath57 denote the degree of numerator and denominator , respectively .    by definition",
    ", the approximant should be regular at the origin .",
    "for @xmath0 regularity at the origin can be achieved if one works with the function @xmath58 instead .",
    "this is a @xmath59 approximant which should be supplemented with four constraints , which for convenience will be rewritten as @xmath60 the effect of the two weinberg sum rules is to reduce the approximant to a @xmath61 approximant of the form @xmath62 in a regular pad - type approximant the masses in the previous formula can be taken from experiment .",
    "in contrast , in a plain pad approximant two more constraints are needed such that the masses are functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "pad approximants are iterative methods , and the exercise done in the previous section is just the first iterative step . in order to improve the approximation",
    "there is a natural and well - defined prescription : new resonance contributions can be added to the ansatz , and for each one two more constraints from low energies should be added to eqs.([2ppa ] ) .",
    ", this is actually feasible and will be the subject of a separate article . ]",
    "the iterative procedure thus defined is empowered by the following result : when the function is meromorphic , there is a theorem by pommerenke  @xcite that ensures convergence of @xmath56 as @xmath63 on a compact subset of the complex plane except on a set of null measure . , _",
    "i.e. _ , when dealing with vacuum condensates . however , numerical exercises with toy models seem to find convergence also there .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "] this includes the physical axis , but also spurious poles that the pad approximant can generate .",
    "these spurious poles can be imaginary , in which case they always come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "for instance , for the values of eqs .",
    "( [ cond6 ] ) and ( [ cond8 ] ) , one finds @xmath64gev@xmath65 , in agreement with pad theory .",
    "there is nothing pathological about the appearance of complex poles : it is the price to pay for approximating an infinite number of poles by a finite number of them",
    ". one should keep in mind that the parameters in the ansatz are not physical and should be seen instead as the effective masses and decay couplings that best approximate the function _ as a whole_. as an illustration of this last point , consider the pion electromagnetic mass difference in eq .",
    "( [ withwsr ] ) . using the mha ,",
    "@xmath66 should be identified with the physical masses for the first vector and axial hadronic states .",
    "this would yield @xmath67 mev , while the maximally - constrained approach yields @xmath68 mev . despite the obvious differences in the interpretation and values for the mass parameters , in this case both methods yield a consistent prediction for @xmath69 .",
    "i can not think of a better example to illustrate the nature of pad approximants and the fact that radically different anstze in minkowski space give reliable predictions in euclidean space .",
    "this last example brings up an interesting question , namely how our the results of the last section would change if different pad approximants , like pad - type or partial - pad approximants , were used .",
    "for instance , one could add a new term in the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) , while fixing the first two poles to the @xmath70 and @xmath71 physical masses , and solve the system of constraint equations again ( partial - pad ) . or ,",
    "alternatively , one could apply an mha - like ansatz by adding four resonances , fixing their poles to the first four experimental masses in the @xmath0 spectrum , and use the constraints to solve for their decay couplings .",
    "it turns out that in the partial - pad case the multiple solutions for the matching equations , unlike the plain pad approximant , do not lead to unique predictions for @xmath26 or @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , the use of a mha - like ansatz leads to a very stable @xmath9 , even if the values for the masses are drastically changed .",
    "however , the values of the vacuum condensates are extremely sensitive to such changes .",
    "this sensitivity of the mha to high energy parameters was already observed in ref .",
    "we can apply the strategy described in the last sections to obtain a prediction for the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate @xmath5 , a quantity introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in the study of the scattering of nucleons in electromagnetic backgrounds .",

    "@xcite against the reliability of vmd .",
    "the use of meromorphic functions to describe correlators in qcd is nowadays a standard procedure at the base of methods like vmd , qcdsr or the mha . from a formal standpoint",
    ", all these methods can be viewed as phenomenological approximations to qcd in the large number of colors . however , for a long time no clear distinction was made between euclidean and minkowski applications .",
    "this might have been the reason why there are some claims in the literature that the large-@xmath7 limit of qcd is unrealistic .",
    "there is no doubt about this if one is confined to the physical axis .",
    "however , this point of view is not justified for euclidean observables .",
    "actually , as long as there is euclidean matching , euclidean observables are very insensitive to changes in the minkowski axis .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed in studies of the mha , where the fundamental importance of euclidean matching was emphasized , but only recently the connection with pad approximants has been made . in pad theory , qcdsr and mha are physical realizations of partial - pad and pad - type approximants , and this stability of euclidean quantities is a natural consequence of pommerenke s theorem .",
    "following pad theory , the main philosophy adopted in this work is that meromorphic anstze are purely interpolators , with poles and residues that need not bear any resemblance to physical parameters .",
    "the method proposed is a plain pad approximant , where poles and residues are constrained in a maximal way .",
    "the method is euclidean in the sense that ( a ) no hadronic input is used and ( b ) predictions should be restricted to euclidean space .",
    "this allows to get analytical results between low and high energy parameters .",
    "the main results are @xmath161 the first expression not only gives a prediction for @xmath37 to be positive ( because @xmath9 is negative ) but , as figure  1 illustrates , it describes correctly _ all _ the phenomenological determinations consistent with a positive @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests a quadratic relation between the condensates , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 . with this relation",
    "one can then perform a fit for @xmath26 and @xmath37 , resulting in @xmath164 it is worth stressing that the previous results give a self - consistent picture , with @xmath165 mev , @xmath166 gev@xmath73 , @xmath167 gev@xmath94 and compatible with factorization . on the other hand , typical values for @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ thri ] ) yield values which favor a large @xmath5 , in excellent agreement with the determinations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that these results are just the first iteration of a pad approximant to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 correlators , this self - consistency is tantalizing and a strong indication that pad approximants to @xmath0 and @xmath1 might converge very fast .",
    "this convergence in any case is restricted to euclidean space .",
    "we have seen that the residues and poles determined through matching can become complex , meaning that there is no possible identification between the parameters in our ansatz and physical hadronic parameters .",
    "this is a limitation of the approach , but by no means pathological .",
    "the ansatz mimics the euclidean behavior of the full spectrum with a finite set of poles .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , the effective poles so determined might not look like physical ones .",
    "this again follows from pommerenke s theorem .",
    "pad approximants might play a fundamental role in an eventual understanding of lmd . at this point , and from the results found in this paper , it seems reasonable to speculate that lmd is closely linked to the ultraviolet behavior of the correlators and so should be assessed on a case - by - case basis .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that lmd works reasonably well for @xmath0",
    ". this might be due to the superconvergence properties of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , for the scalar sector , where the convergence is decreased mainly by the absence of gauge invariance , there have been claims that meson dominance might not be a good approximation  @xcite , and actually the detailed study of ref .",
    "@xcite on the low energy parameter @xmath112 also points in that direction .",
    "one typically notices a seesaw effect between low and high energy parameters : when superconvergence is at work , low energies can be reliably determined , while high energies are extremely challenging .",
    "this happens for instance with @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath1 , where no superconvergence is at work , high energies can be reliably estimated while low energies are hard to handle .",
    "therefore , the discrepancies found in the literature for @xmath5 might be a consequence of misusing lmd .",

    "finally , we need to perform an average over momentum , according to the following formula @xmath182 the previous formula takes into account that the metric tensor is symmetric , so that the allowed permutations are those that can not be reduced using the symmetry properties of the metric . in the following",
