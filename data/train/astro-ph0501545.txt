    "hizss3 ( @xmath10 217.7 , @xmath11 0.01 ) is an h i source in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) , i.e. the region near the galactic plane where foreground extinction from dust and gas causes an apparent decrease in the surface density of extragalactic objects at optical wavelengths .",
    "hizss3 was originally detected at 21-cm by the dwingeloo obscured galaxies survey ( henning et al .",
    "1998 ; rivers , henning , & kraan - korteweg 1999 ; rivers 2000 ) and the h i parkes zone of avoidance shallow survey ( henning et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the name ( hizss3 ) comes from the list in the latter paper .",
    "based on very large array ( vla ) observations , it has an h  i mass of 2 @xmath12 10@xmath13 , assuming a distance of 1.8 mpc estimated from the heliocentric velocity ( 280 km s@xmath14 ) of the h i source transformed to the local group velocity centroid and assuming no peculiar velocity ( massey , henning , & kraan - korteweg 2003 , hereafter mhk2003 ) .",
    "given the low radial velocity of the h  i gas , this distance ( and hence mass ) estimate must be considered unreliable .",
    "a modest h@xmath15 source at the same heliocentric velocity and within the vla 21-cm contours of hizss3 was detected by mhk2003 .",
    "this star - formation site is not spatially coincident with the main , resolved h  i peak in the mhk2003 vla 21-cm map , but rather with a semi - resolved secondary peak .",
    "@xmath16 images obtained by mhk2003 centered on the 21-cm peak failed to detect definitively any stars associated with hizss3 , likely due to a combination of poor seeing ( @xmath0 3 arcsec ) and high foreground extinction ( estimated a@xmath17 4.7 mags ; henning et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "as discussed by mhk2003 , the characteristics of hizss3 suggest that it is a newly discovered , nearby dwarf irregular galaxy ( dim ) . at an estimated distance of 1.8 mpc",
    ", hizss3 lies beyond the zero - velocity boundary of the local group .",
    "however , this 21-cm redshift based distance estimate relies on the assumption that hizss3 has negligible peculiar velocity which is true for most , but not all ( e.g. leo i ) , local group members .",
    "thus , local group membership can not be ruled out based on existing radio data .    in this paper ,",
    "new data are presented from the european southern observatory very large telescope and mmt observatory facilities .",
    "the mmto spectroscopic observations are used to measure foreground reddening and the nebular metallicity of the h ii region detected by mhk2003 .",
    "foreground reddening is independently estimated using vlt near - ir photometric observations and a different methodology .",
    "the two foreground reddening estimates are found to be essentially identical .",
    "more significantly , the stellar component of hizss3 is directly observed for the first time in near - ir images obtained with the vlt . using these images , near - ir luminosity functions as well as a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "are constructed . in combination , these functions and the cmd are used to estimate the metallicity and distance of the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ) . in agreement with mhk2003 ,",
    "the new derived properties of hizss3 presented here are consistent with a previously unknown dwarf irregular galaxy on the outskirts of the local group .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the h  ii region found in hizss3 by mhk2003 was obtained on 2003 november 21 ut at the 6.5 m mmt observatory by pm and kde .",
    "the primary goal of these observations was to determine foreground reddening from spectrophotometry of h@xmath18 relative to h@xmath15 , with a secondary goal of determining the oxygen abundance if the [ o ii ] @xmath19 nebular line could be detected despite the high reddening .",
    "the data were obtained with the mmt blue channel spectrograph using a 500 l mm@xmath14 grating with a dispersion of 1.18  pixel@xmath14 using a 2688x512 backside - processed ccd provided by the university of arizona imaging technology lab . in order to allow in more light",
    ", the slit was opened to 3.5 arcsec , resulting in a resolution of 10 pixels ( 12 ) .",
    "no blocking filter was used in order to maximize the throughput , a seemingly safe choice given that first - order h@xmath15 would be contaminated by second - order light at 3280 . while this proved to be a good choice for the h  ii region , the bluest flux standards ( g191b2b and feige 34 ) showed evidence of a 10% contamination in the red compared to the flux standard hiltner 600 , which has a large balmer jump .",
    "thus , only observations of the latter were used for the flux calibration .",
    "the hizss3 observations were made as eight 1200 sec integrations , with the slit of the spectrograph reset to the parallactic angle at the beginning of each integration .",
    "iraf was used for all data processing .",
    "examination of the two - dimensional spectra revealed that the spatial distribution of the nebular lines was localized to 1  2 arcsec , coincident with the h ii region .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the trace of an observation of the nearby offset star as the template .",
    "sky background was determined from each side of the extraction aperture and subtracted .",
    "there is obvious structure within the slit due to brightness variations of the nebula , and this structure changed with the rotation angle .",
    "therefore , the intensities of the strongest lines ( h@xmath15 , h@xmath18 , and [ oiii ] @xmath20 5007 ) were measured from each individual spectrum .",
    "the spectra went deep enough to detect [ oii ] @xmath19 , although this line and the n[ii ] @xmath21 lines were so weak that they could only be measured in the co - added spectrum .",
    "three pertinent regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ]    the relative emission - line strengths are given in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the actual h@xmath15 flux measured is only about one - quarter the total h@xmath15 luminosity measured from direct images by mhk2003 .",
    "this is due presumably to slit losses necessitated by remaining at the parallactic angle ( position angle @xmath22 degrees ) that prevented the slit from being aligned with the h  ii region ( position angle @xmath23 degrees ; see fig .  3 of mhk2003 ) .",
    "near - ir imaging observations of hizss3 and a nearby reference field were obtained at the eso very large telescope during 2003 november .",
    "time for these images was allocated within the eso director s discretionary time ( ddt ) program .",
    "all vlt observations reported here were executed in service mode .",
    "images were obtained using the short - wavelength ( sw ) arm of the isaac near - ir imaging spectrometer mounted at one of the nasymth foci of the antu / ut1 8.2 m telescope .",
    "the sw arm uses a 1024x1024 hawaii rockwell hgcdte array with a plate scale of 0.148 arcsec pix@xmath14 for a single - image field - of - view of approximately 2.5 @xmath12 2.5 arcmin .",
    "isaac was operated in its standard jitter mode , where a series of images is obtained with random telescope offsets of up to 15 arcsecs relative to a fiducial center point between each individual exposure .",
    "a series of such jittered images was obtained for both the hizss3 field ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , j2000 ) and a nearby reference field ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , j2000 ) in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters . the hizss3 field center was chosen to include both the 21-cm peak and the h  ii region discussed in mhk2003 ( see that work for coordinates ) .",
    "the reference field was selected to have the identical galactic latitude and contain no very bright stars .",
    "it is otherwise unexceptional and located approximately 10 arcmins away .",
    "an additional narrow - band @xmath3 image ( isaac filter nb_1.28 ) of the hizss3 field was obtained to allow the determination of foreground reddening .",
    "all images were obtained under clear , apparently photometric , conditions ( see photometric calibration discussion below ) .",
    "a summary of these observations is provided in table  [ tab : vlt - obslog ] .",
    "the hizss3 and reference field image series were processed by the eso isaac pipeline into single images which were dark , bias , and background corrected .",
    "these images were delivered as part of the standard eso service mode data package .",
    "images were processed using the _ combine_mc _ algorithm , reported to produce photometrically reliable final images .",
    "photometric accuracy was verified by comparing the instrumental magnitudes of stars detected in single frames with the same stars in the combined frames .",
    "no systematic trends with respect to position or magnitude were seen within the area where all images in the series overlapped , confirming the photometric reliability of the pipeline output .",
    "five output images were delivered : @xmath28 and @xmath29 images for both the hizss3 and reference field pointings , as well as @xmath3 for the hizss3 pointing .",
    "all five output images were trimmed to the same area , corresponding to the output image with the smallest area where all input images for that stack overlapped .",
    "the final size of the trimmed images was 951 x 951 pixels , corresponding to 19,810 arcsec@xmath30 or 5.503 arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "the image quality of the output images is excellent : the fwhm of a gaussian fit to the fwhm is close to 0.5 arcsecs in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 frames and 0.6 arcsecs in the @xmath3 frame .",
    "these images clearly reveal the stellar content of hizss3 for the first time .",
    "the @xmath29 hizss3 and reference field images are shown in figure  [ fig : ks ] .",
    "the reference field image simply shows a uniform distribution of stars , while the hizss3 field image clearly shows enhanced object surface density at the locations of the h  ii region and the h  i peak .",
    "figure  [ fig : hii ] shows zoomed @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath3 images of the h  ii region .",
    "this latter figure clearly shows stellar objects associated with the nebular gas .",
    "the eso calibration program provides nightly observations of ukirt photometric standards ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) for isaac sw imaging observations . additional observations of red ukirt standards were obtained in @xmath28 and @xmath3 on the same nights that the hizss3 @xmath3 observations were obtained .",
    "a summary of the relevant standard stars observations is found in table  [ tab : vlt - obslog ] .",
    "input images of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ukirt standards for all three nights were processed by the eso pipeline into standard images that were dark , bias , and background corrected .",
    "these output images were delivered as part of the standard eso service mode data package .",
    "the @xmath3 standard images were not processed by the eso pipeline because the nb_1.28 filter is not supported by the standard pipeline .",
    "therefore , input images were processed manually to correct for bias , dark , and ( minimal ) background .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 ukirt standards were measured using standard iraf aperture photometry tools .",
    "apertures of radii 15 pixels ( 2.22 arcsecs ) were used , with sky annulus radii 20 pixels ( 2.96 arcsecs ) and widths 10 pixels ( 1.48 arcsecs ) . each star was observed as a sequence of five observations at different physical locations on the array  essentially , center , upper left , upper right , lower right , and lower left . for each star ,",
    "the mean and standard deviation was computed from the five individual observations . in all cases ,",
    "the standard deviation was approximately 0.03 mag .",
    "this uncertainty is typical for observations for photometric standards with infrared arrays . it does not arise from photon counting related statistical reasons but from a combination of uncertainties from flat - fielding and illumination corrections , light losses from inter - pixel gaps , bad pixels , and intra - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "photometric transformation zeropoints ( @xmath33 ) were computed from each standard star observation using the following equation :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the filter , @xmath36 is the airmass , @xmath37 is the catalog magnitude , @xmath38 is the mean instrumental magnitude ( i.e. the mean of the five individual measurements ) , and @xmath39 is the adopted extinction coefficient . for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , telluric extinction coefficients of 0.07 and 0.05 ,",
    "respectively , were chosen to minimise the scatter between individual zeropoint measurements .",
    "these values are consistent with the mean values stated in the _ isaac user s manual_. not enough standard stars were observed to determine reliable color terms independently .",
    "however , the isaac color terms are thought to be negligible ( c. lidman , private communication ) .",
    "final nightly zeropoints were computed by computing the mean ( and standard deviation ) of the individual observations . for 2003",
    "november 7 and 9 ut , the @xmath28 zeropoints are @xmath40 ( 5 stars ) and @xmath41 ( 2 stars ) .",
    "for 2003 november 8 and 9 ut , the @xmath29 zeropoints are @xmath42 ( 2 stars ) and @xmath43 ( 2 stars ) . combined with the adopted extinction coefficients , these zeropoints transform instrumental magnitudes into @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the ukirt system ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ; see that work for transformations to other systems ) .",
    "the formal uncertainties of the nightly zeropoints do not provide a definitive constraint on the photometric quality of the relevant nights because of the relatively small number of standard stars observed ( see table  [ tab : vlt - obslog ] ) .",
    "what can be said is : ( 1 ) these measured zeropoint values are consistent with the values reported on the isaac quality control web site ] over a long time period , once aperture differences are taken into account ; ( 2 ) measurements separated by hours on the same night produce zeropoints consistent to within a few percent ; and ( 3 ) variations in atmospheric transmission measured by the paranal ambient site monitor ( asm ) were less than 0.02 mag in the r - band during the entire night for all three nights . in conclusion , the nights during which these vlt observations occurred appear to be have been photometric at the 0.02 mag or better level .",
    "relative emission - line strengths measured in the h  ii region are given in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "using the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law ( a@xmath44 and a@xmath45 ) and an intrinsic ratio h@xmath18/h@xmath15=0.350 , the derived foreground reddening is @xmath46 , where the error represents the standard deviation of the mean for the 8 individual ratios . using this extinction , corrected flux ratios",
    "are given in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the reddening - corrected line ratio [ oiii ] @xmath47 to [ oiii ] @xmath48 is 2.8 , in good agreement with the 2.9 value expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "the vlt p@xmath18 images of the h  ii region can be used to make a similar but independent measurement of the foreground reddening , namely by comparing the flux of the h  ii region at p@xmath18 ( 1.28@xmath49 m ) to that at h@xmath15 .",
    "this technique has been recently exploited in a study of spiral galaxies by jones , elston , & hunter ( 2002 ) .",
    "the only complication is the lack of spectrophotometric standards in the near - ir , necessitating the use of model atmospheres with jhk standards .",
    "we are indebted to l. jones for correspondence and advice on this subject .    the ukirt standards ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) fs  112 ( g0 ) and fs  121 ( k3 ) were observed through the isaac narrow band 1.28@xmath49 m filter ( nb_1.28 ) as well as the broadband @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters .",
    "the kurucz ( 1992 ) atlas 9 @xmath50 , @xmath51k and 4750@xmath52k models were adopted for these two stars . for each model ,",
    "the average fluxes within the @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters were computed . for each star , a conversion factor between model flux ( in physical units ) and observed flux ( in adus per second ) was computed using the hawarden et al .",
    "catalog magnitudes , under the assumption that @xmath53 and @xmath54 for vega .",
    "the conversion factors for the two stars agreed within 10% , providing confidence in this procedure .",
    "these conversion factors were then used to transform observed nb_1.28 flux into absolute flux . in order to determine an emission - line flux for a line - source , the width of the filter",
    "must also be taken into account , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the transmission of the filter as a function of wavelength is used in place of the correct quantity @xmath57 .",
    "the p@xmath18 count rate was then measured after aligning the j@xmath58 image to p@xmath18 , and subtracting after matching the psfs by convolution and scaling .",
    "the derived flux at p@xmath18 is @xmath59 ergs @xmath60 s@xmath14 .",
    "the observed ratio ( p@xmath18/h@xmath61)@xmath62 ( where the flux at h@xmath15 has been taken from mhk2003 ) can be compared to the intrinsic ratio ( p@xmath18/h@xmath61)@xmath63 ( osterbrock 1974 ) .",
    "combined with the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law , the foreground reddening was found to be @xmath64 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value found from the mmto optical spectroscopy ( 1.41@xmath80.04 ) .",
    "the computed mean and standard deviation of these two foreground reddening measurements is @xmath65 . if 1.25 microns and 2.2 microns are adopted as the effective wavelengths of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands , respectively , the cardelli et al .",
    "reddening curve can be used to compute @xmath66 : @xmath67 mag and @xmath68 mag . therefore , @xmath69 mag .    formally , these foreground extinction measurements are only valid for the line - of - sight to the h  ii region .",
    "it is quite possible the foreground extinction across the hizss3 field is variable , either due to variations in the foreground galactic dust distribution or due to ( hypothetical ) dust within hizss3 itself .",
    "for example , the h  ii region could be more dusty than the rest of hizss3 .",
    "it is impossible to constrain the magnitude of possible spatially variable foreground reddening without detailed spectrophotometry of the individual stars in hizss3 .",
    "thus , a single - valued @xmath70 is adopted for the rest of this paper . as discussed later",
    ", this does not have a significant impact on the main conclusions of this work .      without detection of the temperature - sensitive [ oiii]@xmath71 line",
    ", quasi - empirical relations between other emission line ratios and oxygen abundance ( the so - called @xmath72 method ) may be used to approximate the metallicity of the h  ii region ( pagel et al .",
    "three approaches are possible :    * ( 1 ) classical @xmath73 method . *",
    "the @xmath73 ratio @xmath74 } \\lambda 5007 + { \\rm [ oiii]}\\lambda 4959 +   { \\rm [ oii]}\\lambda 3727}{{\\rm h}\\beta}=5.50\\ ] ] has been calibrated by skillman ( 1989 ) for the case that the oxygen abundance is much lower than solar . using his formula results in a value @xmath75 .    * ( 2 ) @xmath73 method modified by [ oiii]/[nii ] . *",
    "edmunds & pagel ( 1984 ) use a modified version of the @xmath73 method , which relies upon using the strength of the n[ii]@xmath21 line as an additional calibration of @xmath73 .",

    "stellar objects were identified in the @xmath29 hizss3 and reference field images images using the daophot star finding routine implemented under iraf .",
    "this routine identifies features that are significantly above the local noise ( in this case , 3@xmath81 ) and whose roundness and sharpness are typical of stars . after removing objects that fell partially on the edge of the images ,",
    "528 objects were detected in the reference field and 739 in the hizss3 field .",
    "although a small percentage of these stellar objects are undoubtably unresolved background objects at high redshift , we assume henceforth that all the detected objects are stars in the milky way or hizss3 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ks ] , the stellar surface density in the hizss3 field is higher near the positions of the h  i peak and h  ii regions reported by mhk2003 . in the reference field ,",
    "the stellar surface density is more uniform .",
    "instrumental aperture magnitudes of the detected stars were measured using iraf aperture photometry tools .",
    "point spread function matching was deemed unnecessary given the relatively low stellar surface density ( see figure  [ fig : ks ] ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured through a 5-pixel ( 0.74 arcsec ) radius circular aperture , using background measurements local to each star .",
    "using the same aperture properties and the pixel coordinates of the stars detected on the @xmath29 frames , aperture magnitudes were also measured on the @xmath28 frames after each @xmath28 frame was geometrically aligned with the corresponding @xmath29 frame to sub - pixel accuracy .",
    "a small number of objects in the @xmath29 reference and hizss3 images ( 3 and 12 , respectively ) were so faint in the corresponding @xmath28 images that @xmath28 magnitudes could not be measured .",
    "these instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the ukirt system using the photometric zeropoints and extinction terms described in the last section . an aperture correction from the 5-pixel radius used for the program stars to the 15-pixel radius used for the standard stars was computed using a few isolated stars in the program fields .",
    "this transformation process was repeated independently for all four hizss3 and reference field frames .",
    "the result is a stellar catalog with @xmath31 and @xmath32 magnitudes ( and corresponding errors ) in the ukirt near - ir photometric system .",
    "note that these magnitudes have _ not _ been corrected for foreground reddening . in principle , such a correction is possible for stars associated with hizss3 by ignoring possible variations in the foreground dust distribution . as shown below , however , stars can only be assigned to hizss3 on a statistical basis , making _ a priori _ extinction corrections of individual magnitudes impossible  a foreground extinction correction can only be made to ensemble properties .",
    "it is also impossible to correct foreground stars for extinction because it can not be assumed they lie at a common distance and therefore a simple screen model can not be assumed .    using this catalog , the luminosity functions shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ]",
    "were constructed .",
    "bin widths are set to 0.4 mag in improve the statistical significance in each bin . in both panels ,",
    "the dashed ( blue ) lines are the 525 stars with @xmath31 and @xmath32 magnitudes in the reference field and the solid ( black ) lines are the 727 stars with @xmath31 and @xmath32 magnitudes in the hizss3 field .",
    "since hizss3 contains only one modest h  ii region , star formation is clearly not happening throughout the bulk of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the brightest stars in the near - ir should be stars at or near the tip of the first - ascent giant branch ( trgb ) . in principle",
    ", the apparent magnitude and color of the trgb can be used to constrain distance and metallicity . to detect the trgb ,",
    "the methodology of lee , freedman , & madore ( 1993 ) is adopted . for a range of histogram bin sizes ,",
    "the hizss3 and reference field @xmath32 luminosity functions are constructed and then subtracted to produce a background corrected @xmath32 luminosity function for hizss3 .",
    "each background subtracted luminosity function is then convolved with a 3-element edge detector filter with the values [ @xmath822,0,@xmath832 ] ( i.e. the so - called zero - sum sobel kernel ) .",
    "the resultant vector has local maxima at the luminosities where histogram discontinuities occur .",
    "the center of the _ next _ luminosity bin is then adopted as the trgb apparent magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : edge ] provides illustrative examples for bin sizes of 0.1 and 0.5 mag , corresponding to trgb edges at @xmath32 = 19.80 and 20.00 , respectively .",
    "trgb edges were determined for bin sizes 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 , 0.30 , 0.35 , 0.40 , 0.45 , and 0.50 mag .",
    "for these nine bins , the mean and standard deviation of the trgb edge brightness is @xmath84 .",
    "this value is consistent with a visual inspection of the luminosity functions shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .",
    "after correction for foreground extinction ( @xmath85 , see section  [ sec : extinct ] ) , this value corresponds to @xmath86 , where the edge brightness uncertainty and the foreground reddening uncertainty have been added in quadrature .    from deeper near - ir observations in the literature",
    ", it is known that object count should continue to increase with magnitude .",
    "this is clearly not the case here , as shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .",
    "estimates of the apparent magnitude where sample incompleteness becomes significant can be made by applying the sobel edge detection methodology again .",
    "for each field and each filter , total luminosity functions ( i.e. without background subtraction ) were constructed for bin sizes between 0.5 and 0.1 mag using steps of 0.05 mag .",
    "each luminosity function was then convolved with the same 3-element edge detection filter as above . for most resultant vectors ,",
    "significant incompleteness is indicated by the global minimum .",
    "the _ previous _",
    "( i.e. next brighter ) bin is adopted as the completeness limit .",

    "the uncertainty of the reference field completeness limit is larger due to the detection of fewer sources .",
    "the object catalog constructed above can also be used to construct the hizss3 and reference field color - magnitude diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",

    "the corresponding numbers are 8 and 3 .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig : cmd ] , it is clear that there are more stars with @xmath89 in the hizss3 field than in the reference field .",
    "this is further quantified in figure  [ fig : colorhist ] which shows that this excess lies in the approximate color range @xmath90 for stars with @xmath91 ( i.e. slightly above trgb and fainter ) and @xmath92 mag . for these criteria , there are significantly more objects ( 141 ) in the hizss3 field than in the reference field ( 39 ) .",

    "about half ( 6 ) of these objects are bluer than the rgb candidates , consistent with them being hotter stars .      using the extinction corrected apparent magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath86 ) and adopted median trgb color ( @xmath95 ) ,",
    "the metallicity and distance to hizss3 can be estimated by comparing the observed hizss3 properties to the properties of galactic globular clusters as presented by valenti , ferraro , & origlia ( 2004a , b ) .",
    "these papers are preferred over older papers by the same team ( e.g. ferraro et al .",
    "2000 ) because all the galactic globular cluster data have been transformed in a uniform way to the 2mass photometric system .",
    "using the ukirt-2mass color transformations found on the 2mass web site , the adopted median rgb color becomes @xmath96 on the 2mass system .",
    "a similar ukirt-2mass transformation of @xmath97 is not necessary given the small ( 0.003 ) color term in the published transformation equation .",
    "the transformed median trgb color is consistent with the trgb colors of the most metal - rich galactic globular clusters ( see valenti et al .",
    "2004a , figure 3 ) where @xmath9 $ ] lies in the range @xmath98 .",
    "recall that in the h  ii region , @xmath99 $ ] @xmath100 , i.e. the nebular gas appears to be significantly more metal - poor than the stars near the trgb .",
    "one speculative explanation for this difference is that the star formation event traced by the h  ii region is being fueled by gas falling into hizss3 for the first time . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that the h  ii region lies in a bulge of the h  i gas ( see mhk2003 ) .",
    "it is possible that this bulge represents recently arrived gas .",
    "higher spatial resolution velocity maps of the h  i gas would be very helpful for investigating this possibility .",
    "such images are currently being obtained and analyzed .    from valenti et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , @xmath101 for metal - rich galactic globular clusters . using @xmath102 as the foreground extinction - corrected trgb apparent magnitude ( see above ) , a hizss3 distance modulus of @xmath103 or @xmath104 mpc is implied .",
    "note that @xmath105 varies slowly with trgb metallicity and thus color ( see , e.g. , valenti et al .",
    "2004b , figure 5 ) . the fact that the adopted trgb color / metallicity is somewhat uncertain does not have a major impact on the adopted @xmath105 .",
    "hence , it does not have a major impact on the distance modulus uncertainty .",
    "the trgb - based distance estimate is remarkably consistent with the 21-cm redshift estimate of 1.8 mpc published by mhk2003 .",
    "values for the trgb apparent magnitude and median rgb color have been set from the aggregate properties of stars distributed spatially across the entire hizss3 field .",
    "however , a measurement of @xmath70 is only available along one line - of - sight , i.e. to the h  ii region contained within hizss3 .",
    "if this h  ii region is more dusty than the rest of hizss3 , the foreground extinction correction for the trgb apparent magnitude would be smaller , increasing the estimated distance to hizss3 .",
    "however , the corrected median rgb color would also become redder , reaching values in excess of median rgb colors of galactic globular clusters , which seems unlikely .",
    "spatially variable foreground extinction is also possible , but its effects ( if present ) would be limited to increasing intrinsic @xmath70 uncertainty and thus distance measurement uncertainty . in summary , the adoption of a single - valued @xmath70 does not have a significant impact on the measurement of mean stellar distance or metallicity .",
    "using data obtained at the mmt observatory and eso very large telescope , the following new properties of hizss3 have been derived :    1 .",
    "a resolved stellar population has been revealed for the first time .",
    "its near - ir properties are consistent with a trgb apparent magnitude of @xmath102 and a median trgb color of @xmath106 .",
    "2 .   the line - of - sight extinction to the h  ii region was found to be @xmath1 based on long - slit spectroscopic observations and @xmath107 based on narrow - band @xmath4 and @xmath3 observations .",
    "given the various uncertainties , this agreement is excellent .",
    "the adopted foreground extinction is @xmath6 for the near - ir photometric measurements .",
    "3 .   based on emission - line equivalent width measurements , the h  ii region metallicity",
    "was found to be log @xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath99 \\sim -0.9 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , the mean rgb metallicity was estimated to be @xmath9 = -0.5\\pm0.1 $ ] based on trgb color . in other words , stars on the rgb appear to be somewhat more metal - rich than the nebular gas .",
    "this difference could be explained if the star formation event traced by the h  ii emission has been fed by lower metallicity gas falling into hizss3 for the first time .",
    "higher spatial resolution maps of the h  i gas have been obtained and will be analyzed to investigate this possibility .",
    "4 .   using the derived trgb apparent magnitude of @xmath108 and an adopted absolute magnitude of @xmath109 , the hizss3 distance modulus was found to be @xmath103 , corresponding to a physical distance of @xmath104 mpc .",
    "this estimate is in excellent agreement with distance estimate of @xmath0 1.8 mpc derived from 21-cm redshifts under the assumption of zero peculiar velocity with respect to the local group velocity centroid .",
    "these newly derived quantities significantly strengthen the conclusion that hizss3 is a newly discovered dim lurking at the edge of the local group . as discussed by mhk2003",
    ", hizss3 appears to be the nearest dim discovered in the last 25 years .",
    "however , the trgb distance estimate presented here ( @xmath0 1.7 mpc ) supports the mhk2003 conclusion that hizss3 is _ not _ a member of the local group , having more in common with galaxies at a similar distance as sextans a , sextans b , ngc 3109 , and antlia .    we thank the eso director s discretionary time committee ( ddtc ) for approving the eso observations .",
    "we also thank lowell tacconi - garman , emmanuel jehin , and wolfgang hummel for their end - to - end assistance with the vlt observations .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge several useful conversations with deidre hunter and lauren jones .",
