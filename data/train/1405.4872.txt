    "forming galaxies have shown that temperature and far - ir colors of the cold dust decline as a function of radius @xcite which could indicate that the old stellar population , also radially distributed , is responsible for heating some of the cold dust @xcite .",
    "conversely , the decline of dust temperatures radially could simply reflect that star formation is also radially declining from the center of the galaxy outward @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite use radiative transfer models to probe the far - ir emission of local , dusty galaxies and find that the old stellar population accounts for less than 20% of the far - ir luminosity , and @xcite apply dust heating models to edge - on spirals and determine that the old stellar population accounts for at most 40% of the dust heating .",
    "in addition to the dust temperatures and heating sources , the physical composition of the dust is seen to change from star forming regions to the diffuse ism .",
    "there is evidence that a substantial portion of grain growth occurs in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "a harsh interstellar radiation field can destroy the smallest grains , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , which would result in these molecules being preferentially located in the photodissociation regions surrounding young stars @xcite .",
    "grain composition could also vary with metallicity .",
    "for example , the small magellanic cloud , a low metallicity galaxy , has a larger fraction of neutral and small pahs than in the milky way @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the hard interstellar radiation field in low metallicity galaxies could be responsible for destroying the smallest pah grains , resulting in a different grain size distribution than observed in the milky way @xcite . in the milky way and other metal rich disk galaxies , modeling the dust as being composed of graphites and amorphous silicates accurately reproduces the mid - ir spectral features and far - ir emission @xcite .",
    "conversely , in metal poor galaxies , modeling grains in this manner produces unphysical gas to dust ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argue for a flattening of the submillimeter slope beyond 500@xmath8 m , possibly due to non - thermal emission from very small grains with a low emissivity index ( @xmath13 ) or changing emissivity properties of larger grains . an increase in the amount of magnetic material will also change the slope , and hence the derived emissivity , of submillimeter emission @xcite .    complex models of dust emission attempt to take into account a heterogenous grain population and multiple temperature components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "values of @xmath17 are commonly applied to other galaxies as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the derived temperature is an average dust temperature .",
    "furthermore , the emissivity derived contains two pieces of information : first , it is comprised of the intrinsic spectral emissivity index of the dust grains ; second , it reflects temperature mixing within a resolution element , particularly due to dust colder than the peak of the blackbody emission .",
    "multiple dust components , each at a different temperature , can serve to make the effective emissivity shallower than the intrinsic emissivity of each dust grain population , and even though @xmath1 may change , this does not necessarily indicate that the composition of the dust is changing .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 derived from mbb fitting is in reality an effective emissivity .    in the present study , we want to test the robustness of the mbb fitting method and explore how the derived properties of the dust change correlate with the possible heating source of the dust .",

    "with mbb fitting , two parameters are used to quantify the shape of the sed .",
    "because @xmath0 and @xmath1 each show radial trends in galaxies in our sample , we conclude that letting both parameters vary when fitting an mbb better describes the far - ir dust emission .",
    "holding one parameter fixed forces the other to compensate for the shape of the far - ir sed , inducing a radial trend .",
    "g12 recommend holding @xmath1 fixed when deriving @xmath0 , mainly because they did not see a correlation between the dust temperatures derived when @xmath1 is a free parameter and possible heating sources of the dust for several galaxies .",
    "we calculate the heating of the dust in a slightly different manner and discuss possible reasons for the radially varying far - ir dust emission in sections [ sec : heating ] and [ sec : submm ] .",
    "we can quantify how well the mbb model is fitting the sed by examining any residual emission .",

    "strictly speaking , @xmath1 merely quantifies the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail . as mentioned above",
    ", it is an effective emissivity , and so it contains two components : ( 1 ) the intrinsic physical emissivity of the dust and ( 2 ) the range of temperatures within a resolution element . letting @xmath1 vary will account for the physical properties of the dust grains changing with radius and the amount of temperature mixing varying throughout the galaxy . in the analysis that follows ,",

    "however , the differences between the distribution of sfrs and @xmath0 values indicate that for many of our galaxies , sfrs alone can not fully account for the temperature distributions of the dust .",
    "a more physical comparison can be made between @xmath0 and the effective sfr , that is , the sfr normalized by the dust mass surface density .",
    "the effective sfr is the ratio of available ionizing photons to the amount of diffuse dust surrounding star forming regions , and it will give a better sense of how effective the sfr is at heating the dust .",

    "they compare distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained by randomly selecting pairs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 values from appropriate ranges and by calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 from a monte carlo fitting technique on simulated seds to determine the amount of anti - correlation inherent in the sed fitting procedure .",
    "they find that the inherent anti - correlation in the fitting procedure is smaller than the anti - correlation seen in their 14 galaxies , leading them to conclude that the anti - correlation is physical in nature .",
    "more recently , a similar result using monte carlo simulations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 was reached for m  31 by @xcite and for the milky way using a monte carlo markov chain algorithm by @xcite .",
    "a physical interpretation is also supported by laboratory measurements of amorphous grains .",
    "@xcite measure a monotonic increase in the absorption coefficient and decrease of emissivity index of amorphous grains as the dust temperature increases from 24 to 295k",
    ". however , laboratory experiments are currently unable to measure the difference in dust emission in the temperature range @xmath100k , which is more of interest here @xcite .",
    "an inverse @xmath0-@xmath1 relationship can also result from mixtures of different grain populations , particularly if the far - ir / submm sed contains emission from small grains or ice mantels .",
    "small grains are predicted to have @xmath101 @xcite , while ice mantles have been predicted to have emissivity values as high as @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "low dust temperatures encourage the formation of ice mantles , leading to higher emissivity values , while high dust temperatures in very small grains inhibit the formation of ice mantles , leading to lower emissivity values .",
    "therefore , on large scales , if the far - ir emission contains a large contribution of small dust grains , observers will measure higher @xmath0 values and lower @xmath1 values , while the inverse will be measured if ice mantles dominate the emission .    on smaller scales ,",
    "the temperature of dust grains is seen to decrease from the diffuse to the dense interstellar medium in the milky way , while the emissivity index increases @xcite .",
    "the grain composition also changes ; a reduction of mid - ir emission towards dense molecular clouds indicates that small grains are less abundant @xcite .",
    "outside the milky way , @xmath1 is measured to be lower in the smc and lmc and shown not to be the result of lower dust temperatures , but instead due to the physical properties of the grain populations@xcite .",
    "uncertainties and low snrs in far - ir photometry can intensify the anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 trend in local molecular clouds is too steep to be explained solely with noise , assuming the cloud has a simple geometry and a dust population with standard optical properties .",
    "the authors therefore conclude that the trend is due to intrinsic variations such as those measured in the laboratory or modeled for amorphous grain emission @xcite .",
    "alternately , the anti - correlation may in fact be due to temperature mixing along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "however , by studying local dense molecular clouds , @xcite conclude that such radiative transfer effects can not explain the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 anti - correlation , since the effect of radiative transfer is to induce an artificial positive correlation . furthermore",
    ", both @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 anti - correlation still exists in regions where temperature mixing along the line of sight is unlikely to have an effect .        in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps for our sample of local star forming galaxies",
    ", it is evident that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not strictly anti - correlated , although this is the general trend , particularly for the low snr data ( figure [ fig : degen ] ) . in part , we have ameliorated such an effect because of our selection of high snr data points ( see section [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    "two galaxies , ngc  3521 and ngc  3621 , exhibit a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while several galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4254 , ngc  7331 ) show only a very weak anti - correlation .",
    "a similar weak anti - correlation has been found at cloud - scale pixel resolution in m 33 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our @xmath1 values display a distinct radial gradient in 14 of our galaxies , similar to what is observed in other local galaxies ( e.g. , g12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not expect that this radial trend is induced by the fitting procedure since it is not observed universally in our sample , and because uncertainties in the data that could be responsible for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 fitting degeneracies should be random and not correlate with radius .",
    "the individual trends exhibited for each galaxy have no obvious correlation with the galaxy s distance or inclination , which would be expected if the strength of the relationship between temperature and emissivity was due strictly to temperature mixing along the line of sight .",
    "we test the effect of temperature mixing by refitting the seds of all of our galaxies , this time using a common kpc@xmath3 region size , instead of a common pixel size .",
    "the use of a standard physical aperture size has no effect on any of the trends we have presented above . from this",
    ", we conclude that temperature mixing occurs on smaller scales than our resolution elements .",
    "indeed , temperature gradients across molecular clouds have been detected locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , indicating that temperature mixing occurs even on scales @xmath103pc .",
    "rederiving @xmath0 or @xmath1 while holding the other parameter fixed lends support to the conclusion that the anti - correlation is in part due to the fitting procedure . in this case , the free parameter ( either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) exhibits a strongly radial trend .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shape of the sed is changing from the center of the galaxy to the outskirts , and when @xmath1 is held fixed , @xmath0 alone must reflect this change , while when @xmath0 is held fixed , @xmath1 in turn compensates .",
    "when the far - ir sed is sparsely sampled , holding @xmath1 fixed is acceptable based on the correlation between the derived temperatures , but caution should be exercised when interpreting any radial trends determined with this method .",
    ", as a function of @xmath1 for all the galaxies in our sample . we shade the symbols according to distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "there is no obvious trend between the effective sfr and @xmath1 .",
    "the typical uncertainties are shown in the lower right corner .",
    "[ fig : sfrl500_both],width=288 ]      we find an almost universal decrease in the measured @xmath1 as a function of radius for our sources ( the notable exceptions are ngc  4254 , ngc  4321 , ngc  4579 , and ngc  4736 , where the distribution of @xmath1 does not vary greatly with radius ) .",
    "a shallower @xmath1 could reflect a differing mixture of dust grains , but as discussed above , the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail is also affected by temperature mixing of dust components within a resolution element .",
    "that is , a flattening in the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail could be explained by the presence of dust components colder than the peak dust temperature .",
    "we can explore the effect of the different dust heating sources on the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail by using the derived effective emissivity to describe the slope .         and",
    "@xmath1 for all galaxies .",
    "we fit a line for all of the galaxies and plot the residuals underneath .",
    "we also shade the points according to radius .",
    "these trends do not appear to be a function of radius .",
    "the trend between @xmath10 is much stronger with @xmath1 than with @xmath0 illustrating the effect of the old stellar population on the far - ir / submm slope .",
    "the typical uncertainties are shown in the lower right corner .",
    "[ fig : l36l500_all_b],width=288 ]    first , we consider the effect of the young stellar population , shown above to be a significant determinant of the average dust temperature .",

    "we fit a line to the data of the form @xmath104 using the ols bisector method , and we list the @xmath28 values in each panel .",
    "there is a sub - linear positive trend between @xmath105 and @xmath1 for most ( 14 ) galaxies , although two galaxies have @xmath106 .",
    "when we compare @xmath1 and sfr/@xmath9 , the average correlation coefficient is @xmath107 , although a few galaxies do have @xmath108 . despite the small correlation coefficients , for all galaxies except ngc  4569 and ngc  4579",
    ", the two - sided significances are consistent with zero . for ngc  4569 an ngc  4579",
    ", the two - sided significance does not rule out the null hypothesis that there is no real correlation .",
    "these @xmath50 values are lower than the degree of correlation measured between sfr/@xmath9 and @xmath0 , indicating that , on average , the effective sfr has a stronger relationship with @xmath0 , although it is still weakly correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "we show the general trend for all galaxies in figure [ fig : sfrl500_both ] .",
    "once all galaxies are considered together , there is a weak , though significant , correlation ( @xmath109 , with a two - sided significance of zero ) , but the scatter around the derived relationship of @xmath110 is large ( the standard deviation of the residuals is 0.34 ) . in general , there does not appear to be any significant correlation with radius , although a correlation is present in some individual galaxies ( most evident in ngc  5055 , ngc  5457 , ngc  7331 , and ngc  7793 ) .",
    "the lack of correlation between sfr and emission in the rayleigh - jeans tail is also seen on a resolved scale in m  33 and on a global scale in 51 local galaxies @xcite where the authors examine a birthrate parameter @xmath111 ( the sfr normalized by the average sfr over the lifetime of the galaxy ) with the far - ir color @xmath112 . at best , the two parameters are anti correlated , but only weakly , and the relationship may be affected by the environment of individual galaxies , producing a non - universal trend .    the other prominent source of isrf photons is the old stellar population .",
    "we consider the contribution from the old stellar population in figure [ fig : l36_l500_b ] , where we plot @xmath10 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath1 is strong , with 13 galaxies having @xmath108 .",
    "all galaxies are considered together in figure [ fig : l36l500_all_b ] , and there is a significant correlation between the parameters , with a spearman s rank @xmath50 of 0.64 and a two - sided significance of zero , which is stronger than the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 is correlated with radius , decreasing towards the outskirts .",
    "again , we test that the correlation between the older stellar population and @xmath1 is not driven solely by radial trends by deriving the correlation coefficients for @xmath10 and radius for each galaxy . we find that the galaxies that have the highest correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath1 do not necessarily have the highest correlations between @xmath10 and radius .",
    "our correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath1 is in line with what is found by @xcite and @xcite for m  33 , m  81 , m  83 , and ngc  2403 . in those galaxies ,",
    "the authors look at the distributions of the warm dust ( traced by the colors @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) and the cold dust ( traced by @xmath115 ) .",
    "the authors find significantly different distributions of the two colors , implying that the two dust components are heated by different sources .",
    "in particular , @xmath116 shows a tight correlation with either stellar mass ( in m  33 ) or 1.6@xmath8 m emission , revealing that the old stellar population is driving the emission in this regime . @xmath116 increases with increasing stellar mass , meaning that the slope rayleigh - jeans tail is steepening ; this corresponds to the larger @xmath1 values that we measure as @xmath10 increases .",
    "@xcite measure a radially decreasing @xmath1 in m  33 , and the authors find a correlation between @xmath1 and h@xmath28 emission , a sfr tracer , leading them to conclude that the physical properties of the dust grains are actually changing due to star formation replenishing the ism with metals , increasing the amount silicates which have a lower emissivity than carbonaceous grains .",
    "we test this conclusion with our larger sample by comparing @xmath1 directly with h@xmath28 .",
    "only seven galaxies have a strong correlation ( @xmath64 ) , and five galaxies have no significant correlation ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we find the same results when we compare with sfr@xmath118 .",
    "we compare this with the results for @xmath10 and @xmath1 , where 12 galaxies have a strong correlation ( @xmath64 ) , and only two galaxies have no significant correlation ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "@xcite also argues for a physical interpretation in the variations of @xmath1 measured in m  31 .",
    "they observe a decrease in @xmath1 in the center of the galaxy and an increase out to 3.1 kpc .",
    "the authors conclude that the decrease of @xmath1 in the center maybe due to sublimation caused by an increased isrf , and the increase of @xmath1 could be caused by the growth of icy mantles .",
    "metallicity is also a tracer of the physical grain properties , although we do not think that metallicity is solely driving the radial dependence of @xmath1 because the metallicity range in any galaxy is very small ( @xmath119 ) . in this metallicity range ,",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail is not typically observed to flatten ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation between @xmath1 and h@xmath28 and sfr@xmath118 indicates that the intrinsic grain properties may be driving the radial distribution of @xmath1 in a few galaxies , although the correlation between @xmath1 and the isrf as quantified by @xmath88 hints that the variations in @xmath1 are could also be due to inefficient heating in the outskirts of the galaxies allowing for colder dust components beyond the peak of the dust emission .",
    "when colder temperature components are seen beyond the peak of the ir sed , this will be reflected by a shallower emissivity .",
    "low @xmath1 values correspond to low @xmath10 values .",
    "higher @xmath1 values , meaning _",
    "less _ temperature mixing , correspond to higher @xmath10 values .",
    "when there are many photons available from the old stellar population to heat the dust , the dust displays a @xmath1 closer to what might be physically expected from the intrinsic properties of the dust grains alone , meaning there is little dust colder than the peak of the sed .",
    "however , when there are few photons available from the older stellar population per unit dust mass , i.e. inefficient heating , the dust has more components at colder temperatures , leading to a shallower rayleigh - jeans slope and a lower derived effective emissivity .",
    "the flattening of the rayleigh - jeans tail shows a radial dependence in most galaxies in our sample .",
    "recently , @xcite has modeled the resolved submillimeter emission by including 870@xmath8 m photometry in a sample of local galaxies . when including the longer wavelength data",
    ", the authors also see a radial flattening of the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "one possible explanation for a flatter rayleigh - jeans tail is a colder dust component , illustrating that heating is the most inefficient in the outskirts of galaxies , which is also supported by the radial decrease of the heating due to young stars and the old stellar population .",
    "we have explored the resolved temperature and emissivity values of dust emission in a large sample of local star forming galaxies .",
    "we model the far - ir dust emission using two temperature modified blackbodies .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the cold dust component by letting both parameters vary simultaneously .",
    "we compare the derived parameters with the sfr@xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we summarize our findings below .    1",
    ".   we further the work of g12 by doubling the sample size and performing similar 2 t mbb fitting on resolved scales .",
    "g12 quantify the dust heating using 24@xmath8 m emission and 3.6@xmath8 m emission and in several galaxies , find little correlation between heating and dust temperatures .",
    "we improve on the heating measurements by using sfr@xmath122 and normalizing by amount of dust present , quantified by @xmath9 .",
    "we find good agreement between the sources of dust heating and the derived dust temperatures .",
    "we advocate letting both parameters vary simultaneously , while taking care to remember that the derived parameters are the average dust temperature and effective emissivity .",
    "when one parameter is held constant , the other exhibits a strong radial trend , indicating that the shape of the far - ir sed is changing from the center to the outskirts of a galaxy . in the present analysis , we find that the radial dependence of the dust emission corresponds to the changing radiation field and sources of heating .",
    "we find a correlation between the effective sfr ( sfr/@xmath9 ) and @xmath0 , indicating that the _ relative _ number of photons from young stars has a significant heating effect on the diffuse , cold dust component .",
    "we find a correlation between the effective heating by the old stellar population ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath1 , which describes the slope of the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail flattens primarily towards the outskirts of galaxies , and this flattening could be due to the presence of colder dust components beyond the peak of the sed .",
    "we interpret the observed correlation between @xmath10 and the derived emissivity to mean that the rayleigh - jeans tail flattens due to inefficient heating by the old stellar population .",
    "the relationship between effective sfr and @xmath0 shows a degree of scatter for each galaxy which suggests that uv photons are not the only source of heating responsible for determining the peak of the ir sed emission . in turn , the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath1 also shows a degree of scatter .",
    "both the old stellar population and newly formed stars are responsible for heating at all far - ir wavelengths , but the newly formed stars seem to be driving the peak of the ir sed as suggested by the good correlation between the effective star formation and the temperatures we derive .",

    "<S> we investigate the far - infrared ( ir ) dust emission for 20 local star forming galaxies from the key insights on nearby galaxies : a far - ir survey with _ herschel _ </S>",
    "<S> ( kingfish ) sample . </S>",
    "<S> we model the far - ir / submillimeter spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using images from _ spitzer space telescope _ and _ herschel space observatory_. we calculate the cold dust temperature ( @xmath0 ) and emissivity ( @xmath1 ) on a pixel by pixel basis ( where each pixel ranges from @xmath2kpc@xmath3 ) using a two temperature modified blackbody fitting routine . </S>",
    "<S> our fitting method allows us to investigate the resolved nature of temperature and emissivity variations by modeling from the galaxy centers to the outskirts ( physical scales of @xmath4 kpc , depending on the size of the galaxy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fit each sed in two ways : ( 1 ) fit @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously , ( 2 ) hold @xmath1 constant and fit @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare @xmath0 and @xmath1 with star formation rates ( calculated from @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the luminosity of the old stellar population ( traced through @xmath7 ) , and the dust mass surface density ( traced by 500@xmath8 m luminosity , @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant trend between sfr/@xmath9 and @xmath0 , implying that the flux of hard uv photons relative to the amount of dust is significantly contributing to the heating of the cold , or diffuse , dust component . </S>",
    "<S> we also see a trend between @xmath10 and @xmath1 , indicating that the old stellar population contributes to the heating at far - ir / submillimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that when @xmath1 is held constant , @xmath0 exhibits a strongly decreasing radial trend , illustrating that the shape of the far - ir sed is changing radially through a galaxy , thus confirming on a sample almost double in size the trends observed in @xcite . </S>"
