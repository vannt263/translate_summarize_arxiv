    "wz sge is a well - studied dwarf nova ( dn , a sub - class of cataclysmic variables - cvs ) with extreme properties .",
    "it has the largest outburst amplitude , shortest orbital period , longest outburst recurrence time , lowest mass roche - lobe filling secondary , and lowest accretion rate of any class of dne @xcite .",
    "in addition it is the brightest dn and arguably the closest cv , with a distance of only @xmath8 pc ( thorstensen 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "wz sge was observed to go into outburst in 1913 , in 1946 and in 1978 and it was consequently assumed to have an outburst period of about 33 years .",
    "the 23 july 2001 outburst , first reported by t. ohshima ( see @xcite ) , was therefore 10 years earlier than expected .    following the nomenclature of @xcite , the optical light curve ( figure 1 ) of the system during the july 2001",
    "outburst exhibits a `` plateau '' phase ( this phase is really a slow decline phase ) , which lasted for about 24 days . during this period",
    "the system brightness underwent a steady decline with a rate of about 0.1 mag / day , falling from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in about 24 days , a sign that the accretion was taking place at a slowly decreasing rate .",
    "it was then followed by a sharp drop ( itself lasting a few days ) of the visual magnitude from @xmath11 down to @xmath12 , where it stayed for about 3 days : the `` dip '' . during the dip ,",
    "accretion had either stopped completely or dropped considerably . between day 29 and day 52 of the outburst ,",
    "the system then underwent 12 successive `` echo '' outbursts : the `` rebrightening '' phase . on the 53rd day ,",
    "the system started to cool without any other noticeable outburst event : the `` cooling '' phase ( in figure 1 the light curve is shown for @xmath13 days only , since for @xmath14 days @xmath15 is a monotonously decreasing function of time , as the star cools ) .",
    "+ the 2001 outburst light curve of wz sge is remarkably similar to its 1978 outburst light curve with practically the same initial decline rate of 0.1mag / day @xcite .",
    "however , in 1978 the plateau and rebrightening phases lasted about 30 days each against 25 days each in the 2001 outburst ( i.e. the outburst in 1978 lasted about 10 days longer than in 2001 ) .",
    "this may be related to the fact that in 2001 wz sge erupted after only 23 years of quiescence , while in 1978 it erupted after 33 years of quiescence .",
    "the 2001 outburst was not as strong as in 1978 . from the iue archive we found that the continuum level of the spectrum has a flux density @xmath16 ( estimated around @xmath17   ) of about @xmath18 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath19 @xmath7 during the early phase of the 1978 outburst , or about 3 times larger than in the 2001 outburst at the same epoch and wavelength @xmath20 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath19 @xmath7 . during the cooling phase ,",
    "the flux density @xmath16 was also larger in 1978 than in 2001 at the same epoch @xcite .",
    "the 1946 eruption , however , was much different , with no apparent rebrightening phase , while the plateau phase had small amplitude variations during the whole duration of the outburst .",
    "+ the main purpose of the present work is to try to account for the observed sequence of temperatures using a numerical model for the accretional heating and subsequent cooling of the accreting white dwarf . in the next section",
    "we address the issue of the accuracy of the temperature determination during the outburst and cooling periods , together with an overview of the estimates of the wd temperature and accretion rate .",
    "we present the code we use to carry out the simulations of the heating and cooling of the wd in section 3 .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 . in the last section",
    "we discuss the possible origin of the observed high temperatures and slow cooling of the white dwarf .",
    "in the present work we consider the observations of wz sge carried out in the far ultraviolet for which the temperature of the accreting white dwarf and/or the mass accretion rate of the system were assessed .",
    "these observations monitor changes in the fuv component of the system during its different phases , over a time span of 20 months . and reveal a cooling of the wd in response to the outburst of about 12,000k .",
    "namely , we consider 4 fuse and 11 hst / stis observations as follows : one fuse observation obtained during the plateau phase , one hst observation obtained during the dip , two hst and one fuse observations obtained during the rebrightening phase and 2 fuse with 8 hst observations obtained during the cooling phase .",
    "a total of 15 observations together with their references are recapitulated in table 1 .    in order to estimate the temperature one generates a grid of theoretical spectra for different values of the surface temperature , gravity and composition , using the synthetic spectra generator codes tlusty and synspec @xcite .",
    "one then masks regions of the observed spectrum that are not characteristic of a wd atmosphere ( such are emission lines for example ) , and a @xmath21 fitting technique is used to find the best fit model .",
    "the mass accretion rate is estimated in a similar manner using different options in the synthetic spectra generator codes tlusty ( the older version is known as tldisk ) and sysnpec .    *",
    "mass accretion rates : * the following mass accretion rates were estimated in the references mentioned in table 1 and should be considered only as an order of estimate . from table 1",
    ", we see that the mass accretion rate estimate during the plateau phase is rather modest , of the order of @xmath22 @xcite on day 7 into outburst ( table 1 ) . during the dip",
    ", the white dwarf might have a temperature of about @xmath23k @xcite on day 27 .",
    "this is more than @xmath24 above its quiescence temperature which is @xmath25 . during the rebrightening phase",
    ", the mass accretion rate seems to be somewhat smaller than during the plateau and only peaks at @xmath26yr@xmath7 @xcite on day 46 .",
    "we put these values into the table , though we feel that they should be considered only as rough estimates rather than actual values and they reflect our inability to assess @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 ) during this epoch .",
    "this is because during the different phases of the outburst , additional components ( such as the accretion disk and other obscuring material ejected during outburst ) contaminate and veil @xcite the spectrum of the white dwarf .",
    "however , during the cooling phase , one expects to see mainly the white dwarf with little or no contribution from the disk and/or other ( possibly masking ) additional components . during this epoch",
    "the white dwarf is exposed and its temperature decreases .",
    "because of that , we decide to use for our modeling the values of the white dwarf temperature obtained during the cooling phase only .",
    "however , discrepancies of up to 5,000k exists between the temperature estimates of @xcite and @xcite , for the observation carried out on day 50 , when the white dwarf was revealed , but apparently also partially masked or / and possibly with an accretion disk component",
    ". the rest of the observations in the cooling phase are consisten within 2,000k .    * temperatures : * we elaborate here a little more on the temperature , using the three different approaches ( denoted a , b and c in table 2 ) .    these were all observations using hst / stis .",
    "in ( a ) we mask the n v region of the spectrum when needed ( together with less affected regions varying from spectrum to spectrum ) and use the latest version of the synthetic spectra generator codes tlusty and synspec @xcite ; in ( b ) the spectral fitting technique uses the same masking regions for all the spectra together with the new version of the code ; and ( c ) is taken from @xcite , which uses a third and different masking technique together with an earlier version of the code . in table 2 , we also list the flux integrated over the wavelength over the entire spectral range of stis , to the power 1/4 , for all the epochs , which is proportional to the effective temperature ( though each integrated flux can be relatively over- or under- estimated ) .    in figure 2",
    "we draw the temperatures listed in table 2 as follows : @xmath29 is represented by stars ; @xmath30 is represented by squares ; @xmath31 is represented by plus signs ; and the temperature estimated through the flux is represented by circles , where it has been arbitrarily scaled so as to fit the last data point for @xmath30 .",
    "the two triangles represent the fuse data points .",
    "the september 2001 datum has temperature estimates ranging from @xmath32k up to @xmath33k . for that particular epoch",
    "the spectrum was taken between the last two echo outbursts and obviously the white dwarf was not the only component and in addition might have been partially masked .",
    "for that reason we decide not to take into consideration the data points that were not known accurately , or which were taken during periods when the white dwarf might still have been veiled . in our numerical modeling we will try to model the cooling temperature as listed in table 2 , with some reservations about the september 2001 entry .",
    "the cooling of the white dwarf is initially pretty rapid and then slows down significantly . if we assume an exponential cooling law @xmath34 ( with @xmath35k ) , equivalent to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the excess temperature of the wd at time @xmath38 , then we find that @xmath2 is not constant , i.e. the cooling is not exponential . in tables 1 and 2",
    ", @xmath38 is counted from the begining of the cooling period , day 52 into outburst , however , it is usually agreed to count the cooling time from the beginning of the cooling phase . therefore , we set here @xmath39 days , and we denote the cooling time at time @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "we find @xmath42 days , @xmath43 days , @xmath44 days , and @xmath45 days .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed cooling following the 2001 july outburst is faster than the cooling observed after the 1978 outburst .",
    "@xcite found a wd temperature of 20,500k , 220 days after the outburst against @xmath46 19,000k at the same epoch for the 2001 outburst ( e.g. observing epoch of april 2002 , day 266 ) . and @xmath46 500 days after the 1978 outburst the temperature was still around 17,500k while the present observations seem to indicate a lower temperature ( @xmath46 17,000k ) 466 days after the 2001 outburst .",
    "in order to model the accretional heating and subsequent cooling of the wd in wz sge , we use a 1d quasi - static evolutionary code without hydrodynamics ( quasi - static assumption ) .",
    "it is an updated version of the quasi - static stellar evolution code of @xcite .",
    "the code includes time variable accretion , opal opacities and boundary layer irradiation which indirectly accounts for the stellar rotational velocity ( see eq.1 below ) .",
    "stellar rotation , however , is not included anywhere else in the code . in this code ,",
    "the white dwarf is computed all the way down to the core , in the region well below the nuclear burning region .",
    "initial models are constructed by the fitting point method and the resulting initial model down to a depth where @xmath47@xmath48 is stored as input for the evolution code . for a given white dwarf mass and an initial effective surface temperature ( @xmath49 ) , we chose @xmath50 to be the theoretical equilibrium radius .",
    "the models built in this manner are initially in equilibrium , and if no matter is accreted onto the wd surface , the wd parameters do not undergo any change on the time scale studied here .",
    "all other details of the code can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out by switching on accretion for the duration of a dwarf nova outburst interval and then shutting it off to follow the cooling of the white dwarf . in this way the effects of compressional heating and boundary layer irradiation can be assessed quantitatively .",
    "the matter is assumed to accrete softly with the same entropy as the white dwarf outer layers . from theoretical considerations ,",
    "one expects the accreting matter , as it transits through the boundary layer region , to increase its temperature ( since the boundary layer temperature is high : @xmath51 ) .",
    "in addition in the boundary layer region , the radial velocity is large and the accreting matter can also heat up by shock . for these reasons the soft accretion assumption is actually not justified , since this advected energy is non - negligible .",
    "however , in our treatment of the boundary layer irradiation , we take into account part of this energy by assuming that a fraction of the energy liberated in the boundary layer ( @xmath52 ) is absorbed by the outer layer of the star : it is included as a source in the energy equation in the outer layer of the star .",
    "the treatment of the boundary layer irradiation is done as follows .",
    "the energy liberated in the boundary layer is given by @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total accretion energy , @xmath55 is the gravitational constant , @xmath56 is the mass of the star , @xmath57 is the radius of the star , @xmath27 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath58 is the angular rotation rate of the star and @xmath59 is the keplerian angular velocity at one stellar radius .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be used as long as the disk is geometrically thin and optically thick and extends to the stellar surface . in the present case one",
    "expects the stellar rotation rate to be the rotation rate of the wd : @xmath60 .",
    "we assumed that only a fraction of the boundary layer luminosity is irradiating the star , namely : @xmath61 a value @xmath62 means that half of the bl luminosity is lost into space while the other half is absorbed by the star . assuming a value @xmath63 means that only 25% of the bl luminosity is absorbed by the star . here , we choose @xmath63 , which is the value used in the work of @xcite , and about half the estimated value of @xcite who used @xmath64 .",
    "we then assume different rotation rates @xmath65 for a non rotating star @xmath66 and the bl luminosity is exactly half the accretion energy @xmath67 , while for a star rotating near break - up @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in this work we took values ranging from @xmath70 ( for no boundary layer irradiation , in order to check only the effect of the compressional heating ) down to @xmath71 ( when the star is slowly rotating and boundary layer irradiation is the main source of heating ) .",
    "clearly a smaller value of @xmath72 will require a smaller value of @xmath73 in order to keep the same amount of bl irradiation in a specific model , and vice versa . however , the compressional heating results obtained in this work are not at all affected by the value of @xmath72 used in the simulations .    in the simulations it is assumed that the accretion and heating of the white dwarf is uniform rather than being restricted to the equatorial region .",
    "in addition , the transfer of angular momentum ( by shear mixing ) into the white dwarf is neglected .",
    "as previously remarked in section 2 , during the outburst , as accretion takes place at a high rate , the star s photospheric emission is overwhelmed by the emission of the hot components ( mainly the inner disk ) , which makes it difficult to assess the exact temperature of the star and its rotation rate @xmath74 .",
    "however , on day 53 the system is found in a low state and starts to cool . during that time",
    "the accretion rate has probably dropped to its quiescence level .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that the temperature increase , due to bl irradiation , is sustained only during accretion , and when the accretion is turned off , the star rapidly radiates away the bl energy absorbed in its outermost layer .",
    "however , the temperature increase due to compressional heating takes place deeper in the outer layers of the star and it takes many days ( months ) for the star to cool .",
    "therefore , we assume that in the cooling phase the observed elevated temperature of the star is due to the compressional heating it has endured during the outburst phase alone .    since bl irradiation and compressional heating take place at different depths in the outer layers of the star , and on different time scales , we model their effect on the temperature of the star in separate model runs .",
    "first we model the compressional heating of the star alone ocuring during the outburst phase , therefore setting @xmath75 in the simulations .",
    "the exact mass accretion rate of the system is not known and it is changing with time during the outburst . from the optical light curve in figure 1 , it seems very likely that initially the mass accretion rate is very high at the onset of the outburst and decreases steadily during the plateau phase . at present",
    ", our code only simulates a constant accretion rate , but at any time the accretion can be turned off to model the cooling .",
    "consequently , we model the outburst phase ( plateau + rebrightening ) by accreting at a constant rate for 52 days , after which accretion is turned off and the wd cools . from table 1 , we expect the mass accretion rate during the outburst phase to be of the order of ( say ) @xmath76yr@xmath7 and the temperature of the star to increase from about @xmath77 up to @xmath78 ( or more , see table 2 ) around day 53 .",
    "we run models with different white dwarf mass , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath5 and vary the mass accretion rate in the range @xmath81yr@xmath82yr@xmath7 .",
    "we chose the initial wd temperature to be around @xmath83 .",
    "ideally we are looking for a model that reaches a temperature of @xmath78 ( or more ) after 52 days of steady accretion , with @xmath84yr@xmath7 , and with a temperature curve as close as possible to the observations of tables 1 & 2 . in table 3 we list models ( 1 - 4 ) obtained for different values of @xmath85 and @xmath27 . from these models ,",
    "model 3 with @xmath86 and @xmath87/year , yields the best fit .",
    "both models 1 & 2 , with a lower white dwarf mass ( @xmath88 and 1 @xmath89 respectively ) , and model 4 , with a lower mass accretion rate ( @xmath90/year ) , yield a lower temperature and a sharper initial temperature drop than the observations . in figure 2",
    "we draw the temperature increase of the wd due to compressional heating alone , together with the observed values , as a function of time for model 3 .",
    "models 4 & 2 are drawn in figures 3 & 4 respectively .",
    "clearly , from figures 3 & 4 , we see that compressional heating alone can not account for the observed temperatures if the mass @xmath91 and/or the mass accretion rate @xmath92/year , because it produces lower temperatures than observed . since both a @xmath5 mass and a @xmath93/year accretion rate are larger than expected , we decided to check the effect of boundary layer irradiation on the temperature of the white dwarf for a model with @xmath94 in addition to the compressional heating .",
    "namely , we decide to check how boundary layer irradiation increases the temperature of the model in addition to compressional heating . specifically , we chose model 2 arbitrarily around t=175 day . there",
    "it has a temperature of only 18,000k ( due to compressional heating , figure 4 ) while the observations indicate that the temperature should be at least 2,000k higher at that epoch .",
    "we therefore run a 1.0 @xmath89 model ( model 5 , same mass as model 2 ) with an initial temperature of 18,000k ( to simulate day 175 of model 2 ) and a quiescent mass accretion rate ( @xmath95/year ) , and we include boundary layer irradiation assuming a rotation rate @xmath96 ( corresponding to the observed rotational velocity of 1200km / s ) .",
    "namely , we wish to check if the additional heating of the boundary layer irradiation of the accretion disk during the cooling phase ( quiescent @xmath27 ) can increase the temperature of the model by 2,000k , and for what value of @xmath27 ( here we model the combine effect of compressional heating and boundary layer irradiation separately , model 2 and model 5 respectively ) .",
    "we find , from model 5 in table 3 , that one can increase the temperature of model 2 at t=175 days by 2,000k by means of boundary layer irradiation if the mass accretion rate is at least @xmath97/year .",
    "in the present numerical exploration we first assumed that all the accretional heating of the white dwarf was due to compressional heating , and we found that the mass of the accreting white dwarf needed in the simulations of the wz sge superoutburst to fit the observations was rather large : @xmath5 .",
    "the average mass accretion rate of the outburst model , @xmath98yr@xmath7 , assessed from the compressional heating simulations , was itself larger by a factor of @xmath99 , than the average value determined from the spectral fits to the observations which was @xmath100yr@xmath7 [ 25 days of accretion at a rate @xmath101yr@xmath7 , followed by 25 days of intermittent accretion at an average rate of @xmath102yr@xmath7 ] .",
    "when we assumed a smaller wd mass of only one solar mass , we found that even with a high mass accretion rate of @xmath93/year the model could not account for the observed temperature .",
    "for that model , we simulated a second source of heating ( in addition to compressional heating ) : boundary layer irradiation at a quiescence mass accretion rate , corresponding to the mass accretion rate during the cooling period .",
    "the mass accretion rate we obtained ( @xmath104/yr ; table 3 ) to fit the observations is in agreement with a recent analysis of an x - ray observation of wz sge .",
    "@xcite presented results of a uniform analysis of all the _ asca _ x - ray observations of non - magnetic cvs . for wz",
    "sge they estimated an x - ray luminosity of about @xmath105 erg s@xmath7 in the range 0.5 - 10 kev , assuming a distance of 69 pc .",
    "rescaling this value to the better estimate of 43 pc ( and also to be consistent with the distance assumed in this work ) leads to @xmath106 erg s@xmath7 for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite found that optically thin boundary layer models @xcite provide the best description of the data .",
    "since the disk is radiating in both + z and -z directions , the x - ray luminosity is at least half the boundary layer luminosity , namely : @xmath107 , and if the star does partially mask the inner disk and boundary layer ( since @xmath108 ) , then one has @xmath109 .",
    "for this reason we assume @xmath110 erg s@xmath7 , and using @xcite s relation for @xmath52 , an angular velocity of @xmath111 km s@xmath7 and a @xmath112 solar mass , we find the quiescence mass accretion rate from the x - ray observation to be @xmath113/yr , about 3 times smaller than our estimates .",
    "another possibility , that we are unable to assess quantitatively , is the slow release of rotational kinetic energy from the outer layer of the star @xcite .",
    "if the outer layer of the star ( equatorial belt ) has been spun up during the outburst , then rotational kinetic energy can be release during the cooling phase as this fast rotating layer spins down .",
    "this effect could account for an additional source of heating of the white dwarf ocuring during the cooling phase .",
    "in this work we have shown that compressional heating alone can account for the cooling curve of wz sge following the july 2001 superoutburst only if the wd in wz sge is massive ( @xmath114 ) and the outburst accretion rate is large ( @xmath115yr@xmath7 ) . if this is not the case , then compressional heating alone is not enough to account for the observed decrease in the wd temperature , and we suggest boundary layer irradiation from a quiescent accretion disk and the slow release of rotational kinetic energy from a fast rotating accretion belt as possible additional sources of heating of the white dwarf to account for the observed temperatures .",

    "<S> if one assumes a lower mass accretion rate or a lower white dwarf mass , then compressional heating alone can not account for the observed temperature decline , and other sources of heating have to be included to increase the temperature of the model to the observed value . </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively check the effect of boundary layer irradiation as such an additional source . </S>"
