    "the high - resolution x - ray imaging capabilities of  and _ xmm - newton _ have provided an unprecedent view of galaxy clusters , revealing a wealth of substructure in their cores and surrounding mpc - scale gaseous atmospheres . in particular , _ chandra _ showed that the low - entropy gas in many , if not most , relaxed cool - core clusters is `` sloshing '' in the central potential well , generating the ubiquitous sharp , arc - like gas density discontinuities , or `` cold fronts , '' that are concentric with the cluster center and often form a spiral pattern .",
    "such sloshing motions are believed to result from a recent gravitational perturbation of the cluster central potential in response to collisions with small subclusters , which do not cause significant visible x - ray disturbance outside the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "active galactic nucleus ( agn ) explosions in the cluster central galaxy , occurring in an asymmetric gas distribution , may also create a disturbance and set off sloshing of the core gas @xcite .",
    "a number of relaxed , cool - core clusters are hosts to radio `` minihalos '' , diffuse steep - spectrum , for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath6 . ] and low surface brightness radio sources , which enclose  albeit they are not obviously connected to  the radio source associated with the central elliptical galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "their emission typically fills the cooling region ( @xmath7 kpc ) and often appears to be bounded by sloshing cold fronts , suggesting a casual connection between minihalos and gas sloshing ( * ? ? ?",

    "the origin of minihalos in cool - core clusters and their possible connection with the giant radio halos found in merging clusters is still unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "one possibility is that sloshing may amplify the magnetic fields and induce turbulence in the cluster cool cores .",
    "numerical simulations show that such turbulence is generated mainly in the region enclosed by the cold fronts , with velocities up to @xmath8 km s@xmath9 on scales of tens of kpc , whereas negligible turbulence is driven outside the sloshing region ( z13 ) .",
    "turbulence in the cool core , in turn , may re - accelerate pre - existing , aged relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and , coupled with the amplification of the local magnetic field , generate diffuse radio emission within the cold front envelope with properties similar to the observed minihalos .    as an alternative to turbulent reacceleration models ,",
    "hadronic ( or secondary ) models posit that the radio - emitting electrons in minihalos are continuously injected by interactions between relativistic cosmic ray protons with the cluster thermal proton population .",
    "recent numerical simulations of gas sloshing , modeling the formation of a minihalo from secondary electrons emitting in the sloshing - amplified magnetic field , have shown that , in these models , the radio emission is expected to be less confined within the sloshing region , due to the amplification of the magnetic field in regions outside the cold fronts ( zuhone et al .",
    "2014 ) . on average ,",
    "the radio emission is found to be more extended than in the turbulent reacceleration simulations , where the turbulence , and thus the minihalo , are entirely confined to the region bounded by the cold fronts ( z13 ) .",

    "@xcite as well as one of the first two clusters in which a correlation between minihalo and cold fronts has been reported @xcite",
    ". here , we use multi - frequency radio observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope ( ) and very large array ( ) to study the spectral properties of the minihalo , which provide important information on the origin of the radio - emitting electrons , and investigate its connection with the sloshing cold fronts seen in the _ chandra _ image .    in table 1 , we summarize the general properties of rxj1720.1 .",

    ", both components have a power - law spectrum with @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively . as seen for the entire minihalo , the spectrum of the central part steepens above 5 ghz ;",
    "a possible steepening is also visible for the tail .              a proper determination of the flux density of an extended and low surface brightness source such as a minihalo requires high sensitivity and good sampling of the short @xmath39 spacings , which provide information on the large angular scales .",

[",
    "fig : mh_inj ] ( upper panels ) , we show the inner portion of the @xmath39 planes at 4.86 ghz ( c configuration ) and 8.44 ghz .",
    "it is clear that the data sampling is very sparse , especially at 8.44 ghz , resulting into a possible underestimate of the diffuse emission at these frequencies .",
    "the maximum angular structure that can be reliably imaged ( @xmath40 ) is also affected by the poorer @xmath39 coverage .",
    "vla full - synthesis observations at 4.9 ghz and 8.4 ghz ( in these same configurations ) should be able to detect emission on maximum scales of @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively ( dashed circles in the lower panels of fig .",

    "however , for shorter observations like the ones used in this paper , @xmath40 is considerably smaller , i.e. , @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively ( solid circles ) .",
    "this implies that , while the 4.86 ghz observation is potentially able to image the whole minihalo , its largest - scale emission  the tail  can not be fully detected at 8.44 ghz and , therefore , the flux measured for such component at this frequency must be considered as a lower limit ( table 4 ) .    to evaluate possible losses of the minihalo emission at 4.86 ghz and 8.44 ghz ,",
    "we have adopted a procedure similar to the injection of _ fake _ giant radio halos in gmrt data sets by @xcite , and .",
    "we injected a minihalo model in the @xmath39 data at 4.86 ghz and 8.44 ghz and then imaged both data sets with the same parameters we used to produce the actual - minihalo images in figs .",
    "[ fig : mh_full](e ) and ( f ) .",
    "we then measured the flux densities of the _ fake _ minihalos and compared them to the injected ones , obtaining an estimate of the losses .    for their statistical purposes , and previous two works injected an `` average '' fake radio halo , composed of a set of optically thin concentric spheres with different radius and flux density .",
    "for the minihalo , because of its asymmetric morphology , we chose to inject a model based on the observed surface brightness distribution rather than using a set of spheres which would not describe well the spiral - shape structure of the minihalo .",
    "our results will depend on the morphology of the injected minihalo , consequently we used our highest - quality image  the  image at 617 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] )  as initial model .",
    "we extracted the clean components of the minihalo from the 617 mhz image and scaled them at 4.86 ghz and 8.44 ghz assuming @xmath193 , which is similar to the spectral index of the minihalo between 317 mhz and 1.4 ghz ( table 4 ) .",
    "we then injected the components in the 4.86 ghz and 8.44 ghz data sets using the task uvsub in aips , selecting a region free of sources and as near as possible to the phase center to minimize primary - beam attenuation .",
    "we ran a number of injections using different regions ; an example is shown in fig .  [ fig : mh_inj ] ( lower panels ) , where we injected a fake minihalo @xmath194 north - west of the actual minihalo .",
    "we found a good agreement between the morphology of the injected minihalo and the observed ones .",
    "more than @xmath195 of the flux density injected at 4.86 ghz is recovered in the images , indicating that possible flux losses are contained within the errors on the minihalo flux density at this frequency ( table 4 ) .",
    "we may expect even higher values of recovered emission , if the minihalo were injected at the phase center ( where the actual minihalo is located ) , where the sensitivity of the observation is the highest .    at 8.44 ghz , we estimated a flux density loss of @xmath196 , thus still within the flux density uncertainty in table 4 .",
    "however , the amount of flux density recovered in the area of the fake minihalo will depend on the initial total flux density injected in that region , and thus on the @xmath197 used to scale the 617 mhz flux density to 8.44 ghz . to evaluate this effect",
    ", we injected fake minihalos steepening progressively the spectral index from @xmath193 to 1.5 ( red empty circles in fig .",
    "we found that an increasing fraction of the injected flux density is lost when the injected flux decreases , with losses of @xmath198 for @xmath199 , @xmath200 for @xmath201 , @xmath202 for @xmath203 , and exceeding @xmath204 for @xmath2051.5 .",
    "we also evaluated the fraction of flux density that is lost for the minihalo components individually .",
    "the 617 mhz clean components were scaled to the higher frequencies using @xmath193 for the central part and @xmath206 for the tail ( table 4 ) .",
    "we found that possible losses at 4.86 ghz are within the flux density uncertainties of @xmath196 and @xmath207 for the central region and tail , respectively ( table 4 ) . at 8.44 ghz",
    ", we recovered @xmath208 of the emission of the central part ( thus again within the error ) , but we are not able to recover the tail .",
    "this is expected given the @xmath39 coverage limitations at this frequency described above .",
    "as a further test to determine whether the spectrum of the tail is intrinsically steeper than that of the central part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_sp]b ) , or if the observed steepness is affected by flux density losses , we injected the tail in the 1.48 ghz and 4.86 ghz data sets assuming that it has the same @xmath193 as the central part .",
    "the empty red circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_sp]b show the flux densities recovered by the imaging at these frequencies .",
    "no significant losses are found at 1.48 ghz and less than @xmath209 loss is estimated at 4.86 ghz .",
    "this indicates that the observed steepness is not driven by flux losses at these frequencies .",
    "we conclude that the high - frequency steepening observed in the minihalo spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_sp ] ) is most likely real .",
    "this is also true for its central part , which dominates the minihalo emission , whereas the steepening in the spectrum of the tail , which does not contribute significantly to the total flux of the minihalo , may be caused by an underestimate of its flux density at 8.44 ghz .",
    "however , due to possibly significant flux density losses at 8.44 ghz , we are unable with the current data to determine the actual change of slope at high frequencies .",
    "we obtained a spectral index map of the minihalo by comparing a pair of images at 617 mhz and 1.48 ghz .",
    "we selected these frequencies because of the similar sensitivity ( @xmath210 @xmath42jy beam@xmath9 ) and @xmath39 coverage of the observations , which ensure a good description of the minihalo flux density and morphology .",
    "we produced images at 617 mhz and 1.48 ghz imposing the same @xmath39 range and restoring beam of @xmath211 , and corrected them for the primary - beam attenuation .",
    "the two images were then aligned and binned by 8 pixels ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "bins with large uncertainties on the spectral index were blanked .",
    "the resulting qualitative spectral index image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spix](a ) , with the 617 mhz contours overlaid to provide a reference for the source morphology .",
    "the spectral index distribution in central region of the minihalo is quite uniform with an average @xmath212 , in good agreement with the slope of the total spectrum in this frequency range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_sp](b ) ) .",
    "the spectral index of the tail is steeper and it increases systematically from @xmath212 to @xmath213 with increasing distance from the center . to analyzed such trend , we first extracted the flux densities at 617 mhz and 1.48 ghz in circular regions along the tail , as shown by the black circles in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spix](b ) , and then computed the corresponding spectral indices .",
    "the size of each circle was chosen to be larger than one beam to sample independent regions ( @xmath214 for regions 1 to 4 , and @xmath215 for regions 5 and 6 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spix](b ) , we show the spectral index as a function of the distance from the cluster center along the minihalo tail . for a comparison",
    ", we also report the spectral index of the central region computed in a @xmath216 region , as shown by the white circle in the inset .",
    "the profile is consistent with the trend seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spix](a ) ; the increase in spectral index is @xmath217 along the 230 kpc - long tail .",
    "[ fig : spix](a ) also shows the spectral index distribution in the head tail radio source . as commonly observed in this type of radio galaxies , a gradual increase of @xmath197",
    "is visible going from the region of the head , which has the flattest spectral index ( @xmath218 ) , to the end of the tail .",
    "such steepening reflects the progressive aging of the relativistic electrons as they travel away from the core .",
    "radio spectral properties of minihalos  the spectral shape and its spatial variations  provide a discriminator for the physical mechanism responsible for the generation of the radio - emitting relativistic electrons in cluster cores ( see brunetti & jones 2014 for a review ) .",
    "however , because of the rarity of minihalos and technical difficulty of separating the central bright radio source from an often much fainter extended source that is the minihalo , spectral data on the minihalos are scarce . until the present work",
    ", only three minihalos had known spectra , none of them detailed .",
    "perseus ( sijbring 1993 ) and ophiuchus each have measurements at three frequencies , which are consistent with power - law spectra ( although there is a hint of a high - frequency steepening in ophiuchus ) .",
    "the recently discovered minihalo in rxj1532.9 + 3021 @xcite has measurements at four frequencies , which are again consistent with a power law up to 1.4 ghz , while hinting at steepening at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved measurements of the minihalo spectral slope were reported for perseus ( sijbring 1993 ) and ophiuchus , but their quality and spatial coverage at the frequencies used for the spectral index mapping is limited .    in this paper",
    ", we presented a new high - sensitivity , well - resolved , multifrequency dataset for the radio minihalo in rxj1720.1 , which makes it the best - studied object of this class .",
    "we report the detection of a possible high - frequency break in the spectrum of this minihalo (  [ sec : spectrum_bcg ] ) , though deeper high - frequency observations are needed to quantify the change of the slope .",
    "furthermore , we detected significant , systematic spatial variations of the minihalo spectrum  the spectral index steepens with the distance from the cluster ( and minihalo ) center (  [ sec : index_map ] ) .",
    "a high - frequency break in the total spectrum favors a reacceleration scenario over plausible alternatives , such as the pure `` secondary '' model , in which the radio - emitting relativistic electrons are produced by hadronic collisions and the spectrum of the electrons is expected to be a power law .",
    "the spectrum of a minihalo powered by turbulence is expected to be a power law with a break or cutoff , which is a consequence of the low efficiency of turbulence as an acceleration mechanism .",
    "the balance between the energy gain through reacceleration and the losses ( primarily via synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation ) sets a cutoff in the resulting energy distribution of the electrons that , in turn , creates a break in the synchrotron spectrum at a frequency determined by the acceleration efficiency ( see , e.g. , simulations of this process in a realistic turbulent cluster core by z13 ) .",
    "our observed spectrum of the rxj1720.1 minihalo exhibits a possible steepening of the spectral index above 5 ghz .",
    "we see indication of a high - frequency spectral break in the spectrum of the central part ( the dominant contributor to the total flux ) and , separately , a hint of steepening in the tail . the significant steepening of the spectral index with increasing distance along the spiral tail ( fig .  [ fig : age]b ) further favors a reacceleration scenario , because such strong spectral variations across the minihalo are not expected in the `` secondary '' model ( zuhone et al .",
    "a similar steepening of the radio spectrum with increased distance from the cluster center has been reported by for the ophiuchus minihalo ( although for that cluster , only a fraction of the minihalo was detected at both frequencies that were used for the spectral map ) .",
    "spatial variations of the spectral slope were also reported for the perseus minihalo ( sijbring 1993 ) ; in fact , spatial variations in perseus prompted the hypothesis of turbulent reacceleration for the origin of the minihalos .",
    "because of their smaller size , the requirement of in - situ acceleration or injection of the radio - emitting electrons in minihalos is less strict than in giant radio halos .",
    "for this reason , here we also discuss the possibility that the observed spectral steepening along the spiral tail ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spix ] ) is simply caused by aging of relativistic electrons that originate in the central region of the minihalo ( e.g. , in the radio galaxy ) and are advected , or diffuse , to its periphery . in this case ,",
    "steeper spectra seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spix ] are simply produced by older electrons . to evaluate whether advection is a possibility , we can estimate the age of the relativistic electrons and check what gas velocity is required to transport them to the observed distances .",
    "since we do not know the magnetic field in this cluster , we will use the field strength for which the total synchrotron and ic energy losses are at their minimum , @xmath219 g , where @xmath220 g is the field whose energy density equals that of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . for the fields above or below this value , the age of the electrons would be shorter , so we assume this value for a conservative estimate .",
    "[ fig : age](a ) shows the minimum advection velocity for this field that would match the observed spectral steepening of the minihalo , as a function of distance along the spiral tail .",
    "here we assume an injection ( initial ) spectral power - law slope of 1 , consistent with the spectrum of the central region of the minihalo .",
    "the resulting velocities are several times larger than the typical gas velocities found in numerical simulations of sloshing cores ( e.g. , ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ; zuhone et al .",
    "2011 , z13 ) , and higher than even the sound speed .",
    "thus , the advection explanation is not feasible",
    ".    particle diffusion along the magnetic field lines may also play a role . in this case , the maximum age of the relativistic electrons determines the minimum spatial diffusion coefficient along the field lines for gev particles , @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the diffusion time and @xmath223 is the diffusion scale .",
    "again , for a conservative estimate , we assume an optimistic picture in which a magnetic field with intensity @xmath224 g ( that maximizes the electron lifetime ) is mostly aligned along the tail of the minihalo , as seen in mhd simulations of the sloshing cool cores @xcite .",
    "we also assume that there are no significant perturbations or waves on small scales that would reduce the diffusion along the field lines due to scatter of the particle pitch angle . the spatial diffusion coefficient required to explain the observed spectral steepening is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : age](b ) .",
    "the required values are very large  for example , orders of magnitude higher than current estimates for our galaxy @xcite .    even in the absence of micro - scale perturbations that could strongly reduce diffusion along the field lines , the field should be advected and perturbed by large - scale gas motions , including turbulence .",
    "the required minimum values of @xmath225 derived in fig .  [ fig : age](b ) place a lower limit on the effective mean - free path of particles and  because particles travel strictly along the field lines  on the minimum coherence ( or tangling ) scales of the magnetic fields .",
    "using @xmath226 from fig .",
    "[ fig : age](b ) , where @xmath227 is the speed of light , we find @xmath228 kpc , which is in tension with the minimum scales of magnetic field fluctuations observed in similar environments .",
    "thus , diffusion of relativistic electrons originating in the central region outwards along the field lines seems to be unable to explain the observed spectral behavior in the minihalo tail , although this possibility can not be firmly ruled out due to our very scarse knowledge of the magnetic field properties and particle / diffusion transport in these environments .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_chandra](a ) , we show a _",

    "the x - ray brightness shows the subtle edges typical of sloshing cold fronts .",
    "however , the radio profiles show an abrupt drop at those positions  no significant radio emission is seen beyond the fronts , even with the high sensitivity of our data that allows us to detect radio brightness at least two orders of magnitude below the peak of the minihalo .",
    "we stress that this behavior of the radio brightness is not an artifact of the radio image reconstruction from the interferometric data , since the largest detectable angular scale at 617 mhz ( table 2 ) is almost an order of magnitude larger than the size of the minihalo .    in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , we show the radial profiles extracted in 90@xmath17 ne and sw quadrants centered on the cluster x - ray peak , where no x - ray cold fronts are visible . unlike the smooth x - ray brightness profiles , the radio brightness decreases sharply in those directions as well .",
    "the observed behavior of the radio and x - ray profiles is similar to that seen in simulations that assume the turbulent reacceleration origin of the radio emission , as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ( z13 ) .",
    "the radio brightness in the simulated minihalo cuts off exactly at the positions of the x - ray cold fronts .",
    "the reason is that turbulence is confined to the volume enclosed by the cold fronts .",
    "minihalos usually surround a compact radio source associated with the central agn , whose powerful explosions blow the radio bubbles commonly seen filling the cavities in the x - ray gas ( e.g. , perseus , fabian et al . 2011 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a review ) .",
    "these agns can not be the primary source of the radio - emitting electrons in minihalos , because the time required for the electrons to spread around the minihalo is too long compared to their radiative cooling time ( e.g. , jaffe 1977 ; see our estimates for diffusion and advection in  [ sec : origin ] for the minihalo in rxj1720.1 ) .",
    "however , the central agn can be the source of seed electrons for in - situ reacceleration .",
    "large - scale sloshing motions may disrupt the old radio bubbles inflated by agn outbursts and redistribute the aging relativistic plasma throughout the core region , where turbulence then picks them up and reaccelerates ( e.g. , z13 ; see also discussion in giacintucci et al .",
    "as mentioned above , hadronic collisions , which should produce relativistic electrons throughout the cluster volume , may also be the source of seed electrons .    in rxj1720.1 ,",
    "the central radio galaxy is weak ( @xmath235 w hz@xmath9 at 1.48 ghz ) and compact ( @xmath150 kpc ) .",
    "no x - ray cavities are visibile in the cluster core region , consistent with the absence of any radio lobes and jets on the corresponding @xmath236 kpc scales .",
    "however , unlike the flat spectra of core - dominated radio galaxies and sources in which the emission is dominated by the beamed radiation of a jet pointing toward us ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectrum of the rxj1720.1 radio galaxy is relatively steep ( @xmath237 ) and similar to that of extended , active radio galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the agn is in the active stage and possesses radio jets / lobes , but they are on sub - kpc scales .",
    "they could be revealed by radio observations with higher angular resolution .",
    "it is possible that the radio galaxy is small because it is young  perhaps it restarted recently after the cessation of the previous cycle of nuclear activity .",
    "the ongoing sloshing motion of the gas core may have had enough time to break up the old , faded radio lobes from the past cycles , and spread their relativistic content throughout the sloshing region .",
    "interestingly , z13 , in their simulation of a sloshing core , considered an initial distribution of seed relativistic electrons in the shape of two filled spheres , mimicking two radio bubbles .",
    "sloshing mixed them thoroughly , and the resulting radio map was very similar to that from the alternative model with the initial uniform distribution of the seed electrons  the final distribution of the radio brightness was determined by the locations of the strongest gas turbulence .",
    "we presented multi - frequency gmrt and vla observations of the radio minihalo in the cool core of rxj1720.1 , which constitute the most detailed radio dataset for this class of objects to date .",
    "the rxj1720.1 minihalo consists of a bright central region that contains most of its flux density , and a @xmath3 kpc - long , arc - shaped tail of lower surface brightness .    based on our flux density measurements at six frequencies between 317 mhz and 8.44 ghz , we studied the integrated radio spectrum of the minihalo and its components .",
    "we found indication of a possible steepening of the spectrum above 5 ghz .",
    "this steepening is seen separately in the spectrum of the central region of the minihalo and possibly in the spectrum of the tail .",
    "deeper , high - frequency observations are necessary to confirm this steepening and quantify the change of the spectral slope .",
    "if confirmed , the presence of a break has important implications for the physical mechanism responsible for the radio - emitting relativistic electrons .    the map of the spectral index between 617 mhz and 1.48 ghz shows that the spectrum steepens systematically with increasing distance from the center , in particular , along the tail of the minihalo .",
    "we have shown that interpretations of this steepening that involve diffusion or advection of electrons produced in the central region and their aging along the way require extreme microphysical conditions or implausible gas velocities .",
    "the proposed mechanisms for the origin of minihalos are turbulent reacceleration and continuous injection of secondary electrons due to inelastic collisions between relativistic and thermal protons .",
    "the presence of a possible spectral break and strong spatial variations of the spectral index challenge the `` secondary '' origin of the minihalo and favors reacceleration by turbulence .",
    "as shown in mhd simulations ( z13 ) , the required turbulence can be generated by sloshing of the low - entropy gas in the cluster cool core .",
    "sloshing also amplifies the magnetic field in the core , increasing the radio emission from the cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "the turbulence should be limited to the volume enclosed by cold fronts visible in the x - ray .",
