    "the theory of bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite has been very successful in explaining a wide variety of phenomena associated with superconductivity .",
    "this is all the more remarkable since it is based on the independent quasi - particle approximation . since very early on corrections to this simple picture",
    "have been investigated to explore what effect , if any , the breakdown of the quasi - particle approximation would have on various superconducting properties .",
    "one body of work in this category is the investigation of collective excitations , beginning with anderson,@xcite bogoliubov _",
    "@xcite , rickayzen @xcite and others.@xcite much of this work was directed towards a proper gauge - invariant description of the meissner effect .",
    "a separate line of work started with migdal @xcite and eliashberg,@xcite and investigated how the coupling of electrons to dynamical phonons would affect the quasiparticle properties of the electrons , including the transition temperature .    while this and other work @xcite focussed on properties in the superconducting state , a different line of enquiry concerned pairing fluctuations above @xmath0 , as these could possibly cause deviations from the mean field picture provided by fermi liquid / bcs theory .",
    "within bcs theory superconductivity arises through the formation of an order parameter , which has both an amplitude and a phase .",
    "@xcite fluctuations can impact both the amplitude and the phase . at the present time phase fluctuations",
    "have been suggested to be relevant to the high-@xmath0 problem . in particular , a school of thought @xcite suggests that electrons have a pair amplitude already above @xmath0 , i.e. they exist as ` pre - formed ' pairs .",
    "the superconducting transition is then simply the temperature at which the pairs acquire a common phase.@xcite the extreme case of this scenario is where two electrons already form a well - defined boson at the critical ( i.e. phase - forming ) temperature ; this temperature is then the bose condensation temperature for the system .",
    "a comprehensive review of such ideas has been provided by randeria.@xcite    these so - called pairing fluctuations would generally lead to a non - zero amplitude for pairing above @xmath0 , with long - ranged superconducting order destroyed by fluctuations .",
    "one school of thought ( to which we subscribe ) suggests that some of the anomalous normal state properties observed in the high @xmath0 systems , in particular the pseudogap , are due to pairing fluctuations , and a goal in this paper is the examination of such fluctuations in different dimensionalities using one particular controlled approximation scheme .    specifically , one technical framework with which one can hope to understand this physics is the so - called t - matrix approach .",
    "within such a scheme , a pairing susceptibility can be defined;@xcite in the usual case,@xcite this pairing susceptibility diverges at @xmath0 , the latter defined by bcs theory .",
    "finding this temperature constitutes an alternate means of defining the transition temperature , and is generally known as the thouless criterion.@xcite however , the existence of a diverging susceptibility ( as one approaches the bcs critical temperature from above ) should impact the single electron properties that determine the critical temperature in the first place .",
    "the t - matrix approximation accomplishes this through a renormalization of the potential an electron experiences .",
    "however , a limitation of this approach is that it can only be justified as a low density expansion of the two - particle green s function .",
    "@xcite    several many - body frameworks within which the t - matrix approximation can be cast have been discussed by baym and kadanoff and coworkers @xcite many years ago .",
    "the particular choice of framework unfortunately influences the results one obtains when calculations for a particular model system are actually performed .",
    "for example , in ref.,@xcite a particular prescription for the single electron self - energy is derived through an equation - of - motion method .",
    "the resulting expression requires the use of two ` levels ' of single electron green functions , one bare , the other renormalized ; that is , the latter contains a self - energy , and , consequently , such calculations must proceed self - consistently . nonetheless , already in this work@xcite ( see footnote 13 and the discussion at the end of section 3 ) it was recognized that certain features of this approximation were not acceptable .",
    "several years later the issue was debated some more , @xcite until what one could refer to as the ` patton fix ' emerged as the allegedly correct way to handle the difficulties with the kadanoff - martin prescription . in this adjustment ,",
    "one of the self - consistent single electron green functions is simply replaced with its non - self - consistent bare counterpart .",
    "this corrects some problems , but the adjustment is completely _ ad hoc _ , and has been called ",
    "non @xmath2 derivable\".@xcite such an approach has been championed recently by levin and coworkers,@xcite and has found some agreement with experiments on the high @xmath0 cuprates .",
    "earlier , baym @xcite had formulated a theory of single electron and two particle properties based on functional derivatives of a free energy functional , a procedure which guaranteed that certain conservation laws would be satisfied .",
    "this formulation is known as a conserving approximation , and its extension to lattice electrons is known as the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) @xcite .",
    "when only the particle - particle channel is retained , the flex becomes a t - matrix theory with fully self - consistent single electron green functions .",
    "such a formulation would appear to be the most accurate of the t - matrix approximations , since it includes the most number of diagrams .",
    "however , this claim is , in our opinion , unfounded .",
    "the possibility that vertex approximations ( omitted in all t - matrix theories discussed here ) partially cancel some of the self - energy contributions retained in the more fully self - consistent t - matrix approximations appears likely.@xcite that is , including more channels and making everything self - consistent is not the panacea it might seem to be  this point has been emphasized in the alternative formulation of this problem by vilk and tremblay.@xcite    it is probably fair to say that ` modern ' interest , and a viable theoretical approach , on the influence of pair fluctuations on the superconducting transition was initiated by leggett.@xcite this was later followed by an important paper by nozires and schmitt - rink,@xcite wherein they solved for the zero temperature properties of an electron gas with attractive interactions , for all coupling strengths .",
    "they showed that the bcs approximation gave the correct limiting behaviour in the strong coupling limit , where , in the lattice model at least , it was clear that the model was best described by tightly bound pairs of electrons . in this limit , it became clear that the superconducting transition was properly described by a bose condensation of electron pairs .",
    "an important technical point raised in these two papers was that both the bcs gap equation and number equation were required , and had to be solved self - consistently .",
    "this work was further extended to two dimensions in the context of the high @xmath0 cuprates , by schmitt - rink , varma , and ruckenstein , in ref .",
    "@xcite they made the point that , for a specific ( and fixed ) electron density , as the temperature was lowered the chemical potential would self - consistently adjust so as to avoid the thouless instability .",
    "( note the necessity of adhering to the lesson from ref.,@xcite that being that one must solve both for the normal state properties and the electronic density simultaneously . ) in fact , all electron densities would result in a situation at @xmath3 in which the fermi surface no longer exists ; the electrons are paired in bose - like bound states , and the chemical potential is simply half of the single pair bound state energy .",
    "this result violates luttinger s theorem.@xcite improvements were made by serene,@xcite tokumitu _",
    "@xcite , and later , for lattice fermions , by three of the present authors,@xcite but the physics obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite remains .",
    "in fact , for lattice fermions the results are more physical , as the thouless curve becomes a locus of points in the @xmath4 plane on which the electron density is identically equal to unity@xcite ( as opposed to a diverging quantity ) .",
    "again , the simultaneous solution of the superconducting transition and the equation for the electronic density is required .",
    "since then a significant number of calculations have appeared on the t - matrix problems ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite in addition , arguments against such formulations and in favour of alternate frameworks requiring vertex corrections , have also appeared.@xcite this body of work represents a significant advance in the study of the effect of fluctuations at temperatures above the superconducting transition .",
    "however , much of the ` mathematical contortions ' that are invoked can be traced to the difficulty of studying two - dimensional systems in which the mermin - wagner theorem precludes the existence of true long - ranged order ( in the systems studied here).@xcite self consistency , and other formulations , aim to recover this result from any thouless criterion approach ( by which we imply theory attempting to identify @xmath0 through a diverging pair susceptibility ) .",
    "a simple remedy to avoid the mermin - wagner theorem is to study a three dimensional system .",
    "therefore , in this paper we focus on a purely electronic hamiltonian that yields a nonzero superconducting transition temperature , the attractive hubbard model for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "further , in three dimensions we can avoid the necessity of using a self - consistent theory , especially for weak coupling , and this is a simplification which will allow for us to solve for the self energy of a finite lattice , using the method outlined in the following sections of this paper , to essentially any numerical accuracy that we require .    in the above - described work ,",
    "the appearance of a pseudogap , an experimentally observed phenomenon in which the single - particle density of states is suppressed in the form of an incompletely formed superconducting gap,@xcite is predicted .",
    "the literature on this question is now substantial  for a review of recent ideas see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . a recurring theme in some of this work ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "ref.@xcite ) is that the pseudogap found in the high @xmath0 cuprates can be associated with the two dimensional nature of the cuo planes . in terms of fluctuations , and in its simplest form , this is simply the statement that one expects enhanced fluctuations , towards the low - temperature phase , the lower the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "the analysis that we present in this paper suggests that two dimensions may , in fact , not be necessary , because a pseudogap is found in the three dimensional attractive hubbard model at weak coupling .",
    "for example , even at a temperature of a few per cent above the superconducting transition , in the three - dimensional attractive hubbard model at half filling , clear evidence of a single - particle density of states pseudogap is found , and the magnitude of the gap is comparable to the bcs gap that would be found at @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the number of papers on the 3d pseudogap is very small , compared to that for the 2d problem , so comparisons with other work are difficult . instead , here we shall simply address the question ,",
    "should one expect a pseudogap in the 3d system with purely electronic attractive interactions ?",
    "we consider lattice fermions and the attractive hubbard model ; we restrict our attention to a kinetic energy that includes nearest neighbour hopping only . working in the grand canonical ensemble",
    "thus leads us to consider the so - called grand hamiltonian @xmath5 defined by [ hubbard_hamiltonian ] k = -t  _ , * m^ * ( c_*m*^c_*m^ * , + c_*m^ * ^c_*m * , ) -  _ * m * , n_*m * -|u|  _ * m * n_*m*n_*m *  . in this equation @xmath6 is the single particle hopping matrix element for nearest neighbour sites , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , @xmath8 is the on - site attractive potential , @xmath9 and @xmath10 label the lattice sites , while @xmath11 denotes nearest neighbour sites ( which are counted only once in the kinetic energy sum ) , and @xmath12 is the electron spin . the electron creation ( annihilation ) and number operators with spin @xmath12 at lattice site",
    "@xmath9 are given by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we restrict ourselves to one - dimensional chains , and three - dimensional simple cubic lattices , and employ periodic boundary conditions .",
    "firstly , we define the required thermal green s functions .",
    "the single electron green s function@xcite monitors the history of an electron injected at ( imaginary ) time @xmath16 and lattice site @xmath17 , and removed at time @xmath18 and site @xmath19 , and is defined by [ single ] g_(*m*_1,_1 ; * m*_1_1 ) = ( -)_g_(11 )  g(1 - 1 )  .",
    "we use standard abbreviating notation , @xmath20 , and note that the last result of eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) follows from the translational periodicity , the time invariance , and spin isotropy of our lattice and hamiltonian .",
    "similarly , the two - electron propagator is given by [ two - general ] & & g_(*m*_1,_1 ; * m*_2 , _ 2 ; * m*_1 , _ 1 ; * m*_2 , _ 2 )   g(12;12 ) + & & =  _  .",

    "this latter function s transform in momentum / energy space can be simplified by incorporating translational periodicity and temporal invariance , and we introduce the notation @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "[ pair - ft2 ] an examination of eqs .",

    "the pair propagator s connection to superconductivity can be made apparent by introducing the pair annihilation operator via _ * q *  =   _ * q *   c _ + * q * c _ - * q * [ delta - pair ] and then noting , by eq .",

    "as the discussion of ambegaokar@xcite makes apparent , the poles of the pair propagator correspond to the relaxation times of a pair described by the retarded green s function ( also see ref .",
    "most of the poles correspond to continuum states comprised simply of two single ( quasi- ) electron states .",
    "two poles are exceptions ; initially these occur on the real axis .",
    "however , at sufficiently low temperature these poles form conjugate pairs on the imaginary axis .",
    "one of these poles signals an exponentially unstable ( _ viz . _",
    "growing ) paired state implying that the normal state has now become unstable with respect to some new state whose stability is presumably related to these paired electrons .",

    "the physical content of this approximation can be made most apparent if we begin with the equation for the 2-particle green s function expressed in terms of the effective 2-particle interaction , which is given by ( again , suppressing spin indices and sums over these indices ) & & g ( q;q , q ) = n ( q - q ) g^0 ( + q ) g^0 ( - q ) + & -&g^0 ( + q ) g^0 ( - q ) ( q;q , q ) g^0 ( + q ) g^0 ( - q ) [ g2_la_eqn ] where @xmath30 is the noninteracting single - electron green s function .",
