    "the interest in logarithmic conformal field theories ( cfts ) ( see @xcite for an introduction ) has grown over the last ten years or so as their potential role in condensed matter as well as string theory applications has become more evident .",
    "condensed matter applications include critical geometrical models in two dimensions such as percolation and polymers ( see @xcite for a recent contribution and review ) , and critical points in non - interacting disordered fermion models in @xmath10 dimensions ( see @xcite for recent contributions ) , such as the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall and spin quantum hall effect .",
    "string theory applications include the study of sigma models on non - compact ( super- ) target spaces such as psu@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "logarithmic cfts are also fascinating mathematical objects in their own right , bound to attract the attention of representation theory experts .",
    "logarithmic cfts were encountered as early as 1987 by knizhnik @xcite . in 1992 ,",
    "rozansky and saleur tackled in some details one of the simplest such theory , the wzw model on the u(@xmath12 ) supergroup .",
    "they found that the non - semisimplicity of u(@xmath12 ) carried over to the cft , with the possibility of a non - diagonal virasoro generator ( here , proportional to the superalgebra casimir ) @xmath13 , indecomposable operator product expansions ( opes ) , and logarithms in some of the correlators @xcite .",
    "the potential generality of these features was realized almost simultaneously by gurarie in 1993 @xcite , who coined the name logarithmic cft .",
    "certainly the theory of symplectic fermions is the best understood logarithmic cft @xcite .",
    "[ a close second is the wzw model on u(@xmath12 ) where powerful results were obtained recently using the minisuperspace approach @xcite .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the current algebra structure makes this example qualitatively different from the logarithmic cfts of more physical interest . ]",
    "a natural extension of the symplectic fermions has given rise to the so - called `` augmented @xmath14 models '' , which exhibit an enlarged triplet @xmath15 algebra @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of these theories is that the identity has a logarithmic partner , and thus that there are at least two fields of vanishing dimension .",
    "there have been some attempts to generalize the structure of the augmented @xmath14 models to other series , in particular the @xmath16 case @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting cases , with numerous condensed matter applications to disordered systems , corresponds to vanishing central charge .",
    "consideration of singularities in opes as @xmath17 led gurarie to the conjecture that in these theories the stress energy tensor @xmath18 had a logarithmic partner @xmath19 such that @xmath13 had a jordan cell of dimension 2 at the level @xmath20 @xcite . in this and in subsequent papers gurarie and",
    "ludwig @xcite proposed to use the modes of @xmath19 to define an extension of the virasoro algebra characterized by a parameter @xmath21 . [",
    "although appealing intuitively and successful in some cases , the idea has not borne much fruit , in particular because of considerable difficulties in putting together chiral and non chiral sectors . ]",
    "the problem has also been discussed from a slightly different point of view of the replica limit by cardy @xcite .",
    "most of the approaches mentioned so far start from the consideration of abstract conformal field theories",
    ". such generality may not be the easiest way to proceed . in 2001 , we defined families of supersymmetric lattice models , whose continuum limits we identified with the ir limits of conformal supersymmetric non - linear sigma models , or in some cases with landau - ginzburg theories @xcite .",
    "[ for instance , one of these lattice models was defined using alternating fundamental and conjugate representations of sl(@xmath2 ) and argued , in the continuum limit , to be described by the ir limit of the @xmath22 model at @xmath23 .",
    "this model is closely related to the properties of hulls of percolation @xcite .",
    "a similar model was defined for dilute and dense polymers . ] in all these cases , we obtained the full spectrum of the associated logarithmic conformal field theory , and found considerable richness , including an infinite set of virasoro primary fields which all have rational conformal weights , and indications of a large non chiral symmetry algebra commuting with virasoro .",
    "we note that in all our examples with @xmath4 , there was a single field with vanishing dimension .",
    "we expect in general that the logarithmic theories we uncovered do not coincide with any of the extended @xmath14 or @xmath16 models mentioned before ( except for the symplectic fermions ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider a broad view of the strategies pursued in these various references .",
    "first , we point out that the traditional idea of a _ rational _ cft contains two essential ingredients @xcite : the local fields ( or corresponding states ) fall into a _ finite _ number of representations of the chiral algebra ( which in the strictest view of rational cft is generated by a finite number of bosonic local fields of integer conformal weights ) , and these representations are semisimple , that is fully decomposable as direct sums of irreducible representations of the chiral algebra .",
    "hence also the operator products of local fields decompose fully into sums of these local fields .",
    "next , we note that the occurrence of logarithms in correlators is due to @xmath24 not being diagonalizable , and this results from the appearance of fields transforming in non - semisimple representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "one is then led to consider indecomposable representations that are not necessarily irreducible .",
    "the next problem is how to control these theories that do not satisfy this requirement of traditional rational cfts .",
    "many of the papers cited above try to do so by considering extended chiral algebras @xcite , such that the number of indecomposable representations is finite , so that in this sense one may speak of `` rational logarithmic cfts '' .",
    "but many applications , such as to disordered systems , and all the theories we consider in this paper , appear to possess only the virasoro algebra as the chiral algebra , and infinitely many ( non - isomorphic ) indecomposable representations appear as local fields .",
    "in addition , these theories may even fail to be quasirational , that is infinite sums of local fields may be produced in ope s . in these irrational cfts , it is not clear how the analysis is to be organized .",
    "we propose that the use of symmetry algebras that commute with the _ full _ chiral algebra @xcite can be a powerful organizing principle , even when semisimplicity of the algebraic structures is lost .",
    "these symmetries and structures can be usefully studied by starting with lattice models .",
    "the idea of gaining understanding of logarithmic cft ( lcft ) by studying lattice realizations in details has been around for a while , and put forward most recently ( albeit without the algebraic connotations we consider crucial ) in @xcite .",
    "it does open a fruitful new route to progress .",
    "indeed , the lattice equivalent of the reducible but indecomposable virasoro representations in lcft is the non semi - simplicity of the various algebras underlying the lattice models .",
    "[ examples include the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra or @xmath25sl@xmath26 , neither of which is semi - simple when @xmath27 is a root of unity ; such values are usually those of greatest interest .",
    "] a great deal of progress has been made in the mathematics literature in this area over the last fifteen years or so .",
    "our strategy will be to exploit this progress and infer from it results about the lcfts .",
    "more precisely , the lattice models we deal with all have a similar structure ( we discuss here only the boundary case , even though many results generalize to the case of the bulk ) . the local hamiltonian densities generate an associative algebra ( in our examples , the tl algebra ) whose commutant , in the lattice hilbert space of interest , is @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) in the example of the spin-1/2 chain , or in the supersymmetric models in refs.@xcite a remarkably large algebra whose representations are in `` morita equivalence '' with those of @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) . using results from the mathematics literature @xcite and others we derive @xcite",
    ", we can analyze in full detail the structure of these two commuting algebras ( which are in so - called ringel duality ) and their representations in the lattice model .",
    "it is then a natural step to conjecture the corresponding structure in the continuum limit : the algebra of hamiltonian densities goes over to the virasoro algebra @xcite , while the commutant goes over to an algebra of non - local charges .",
    "the general structure of the theory is one in which the virasoro algebra commutes with a certain symmetry algebra , but the latter is _ not _ any kind of current algebra , and nor is it a yangian .",
    "the structure of indecomposable representations in the lattice model goes over to the continuum limit , and we thus obtain information about the representations of the virasoro algebra in our logarithmic theories .",
    "these representations are typically reducible but indecomposable with a diamond ( or quartet ) shape and made out of two `` standard modules '' connected by some `` glue '' .",
    "they bear a lot of resemblance to the so - called staggered modules introduced abstractly in @xcite .",
    "the full structure of the hilbert space involves big indecomposables representations of virasoro and of its commutant , and can be exhibited in the form of what we will call a `` staircase diagram '' .",
    "although our approach does not so far yield much information on the detailed structure of the virasoro indecomposable representations , it is enough to give access to the fusion rules for our logarithmic theories .",
    "we work these out in detail in some cases .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the general framework of the lattice models , algebraic structures , and the continuum limit , for @xmath27 not a root of unity , and also the general features of cases in which @xmath27 is a root of unity .",
    "the following three sections go into details about particular examples of special interest .",
    "each one begins with a summary of the physical systems considered , viewed as loop models , or as field theories of certain nonlinear sigma models or landau - ginzburg theories , then describes the algebraic structures leading to the continuum limit , and ending with the fusion rules .",
    "section 3 is the case @xmath30 ( or central charge @xmath3 in the continuum limit ) , which corresponds to symplectic fermions or dense polymers .",
    "section 4 is the case @xmath31 ( @xmath4 in the continuum limit ) , which corresponds to percolation , the spin quantum hall transition , or a certain nonlinear sigma model at @xmath23 .",
    "section 5 is the case of dilute polymers ( @xmath4 ) , or of the critical point in a certain nonlinear sigma model or landau - ginzburg theory .",
    "for this theory we discuss the continuum directly , and not the lattice models .",
    "finally , section 6 is a more physical discussion of the structures for the cases with @xmath4 , using operator product expansions , and making contact with the work of gurarie and ludwig @xcite .    to make reading easier",
    ", we provide a list of notations for some of the algebraic objects we introduce , all of which implicitly depend on @xmath27 or the central charge @xmath32 , and also on length @xmath33 for the tl algebra :    @xmath34 : tilting modules over @xmath28(sl@xmath29 )    @xmath35 : projective modules over tl@xmath36    @xmath37 : standard modules over the virasoro algebra    @xmath38 : simple ( or irreducible ) modules over the virasoro algebra    @xmath39 : projective modules over the virasoro algebra",
    "what we will do here is ( i ) take the continuum limit of the lattice model on a strip to obtain the representation content of the states , and ( ii ) also use the lattice to infer fusion rules for the boundary cft .    in the companion paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the commutant algebras of the temperley - lieb algebra in some supersymmetric lattice models are morita equivalent @xcite to @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) .",
    "accordingly , here we can use the @xmath28(sl@xmath29)-invariant spin-1/2 chain , secure in the knowledge that the symmetry structure is the same in the supersymmetric constructions that apply when @xmath40 is an integer .",
    "we often refer to representations as modules , as these are essentially the same things for our purposes ( however , in the more mathematical discussions , saying `` representation '' in place of `` module '' would be quite misleading in some places , especially when preceded by `` projective '' ) .",
    "then an irreducible representation is the same thing as a simple module , and it is also common to speak of modules being `` over '' the algebra that they represent .",
    "we assume familiarity with basic algebraic concepts such as sub- and quotient- objects , here usually for modules . for a general reference on the algebraic background",
    ", we suggest ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath28(sl@xmath29)-invariant spin-1/2 chain is essentially the xxz chain , but with some boundary terms ( here the @xmath41 operators are pauli matrices):@xmath42 the hamiltonian @xmath43 is built from generators @xmath44 , @xmath45 of the tl algebra tl@xmath46 , which is defined as the algebra generated by a set of elements @xmath44 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,  ,",
    "@xmath49 , subject to the relations @xmath50and no other relations algebraically independent of these .",
    "these are satisfied by the above expressions in the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "then @xmath51 ( up to an irrelevant additional constant ) .",
    "all future references to the spin-1/2 or xxz chain are to this model .",
    "first we briefly summarize the case of @xmath27 generic ( i.e. , @xmath27 not a root of unity ) and its continuum limit . for @xmath27",
    "not a root of unity , the tl algebra is semisimple and has irreducible representations ( all such will be referred to as simple modules hereafter ) labeled by @xmath52 , @xmath0 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath53 but restricted to values such that @xmath54 is an integer .",
    "the dimensions of these simple modules are @xmath55,@xmath56 these modules are referred to as standard ( or specht ) modules .",
    "the commutant of the tl algebra in the spin-1/2 chain is a finite - dimensional homomorphic image of @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) , that we will denote @xmath25sl@xmath57 ( it is also called the @xmath27-schur algebra ) . for @xmath27 generic ,",
    "its simple modules are again labeled @xmath52 , @xmath0 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath58 , where @xmath54 is an integer .",
    "throughout the paper , we will use the familiar term `` spin '' to refer to @xmath59 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "these modules have dimensions @xmath60 , independent of @xmath61 except that @xmath62 .",
    "they are called weyl modules [ or standard modules of @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) ] ( we can drop the superscript @xmath61 as they are independent of it , and the limit @xmath63 can be taken for these ) .",
    "they are the deformations to @xmath64 of the usual irreducibles of su(2 ) .",
    "if two chains of lengths @xmath65 , @xmath66 are joined end to end ( with @xmath65 on the left ) , one obtains fusion rules for both algebras .",
    "the states of a single chain of length @xmath65 fall into multiplets ( simple modules ) of the tensor product of commuting algebras , tl@xmath67sl@xmath68 which are labeled by @xmath59 ; these modules are the tensor product of the corresponding simple modules of the two respective algebras .",
    "when the two chains are joined , the resulting chain of length @xmath69 can be analyzed in the same way . if the standard modules of @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) are denoted @xmath70 , then tensor products of such modules ( where the tensor product is defined as in the usual way for vector spaces ) decompose fully into a direct sum,@xmath71exactly as for su(2 ) .",
    "the standard modules of tl must behave in a similar way , but now the product operation is defined using induction ( which may be familiar from induced representations in group representation theory ) from the product space as a module over tl@xmath72tl@xmath73 to a module over tl@xmath74 , which contains the former as a subalgebra . the general theory described in ref .",
    "@xcite implies that indeed the `` fusion rule '' for this definition of a product of tl modules must take the same form as that above for @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) ( note this product is a functor , and not just a decomposition of the tensor product of vectors ; in particular the dimensions of the tensor product of the modules on the left and the sum of those on the right are not equal ) .",
    "now we pass to the continuum limit .",
    "from this point on , we consider only @xmath75 even for the time being .",
    "( this does no harm as the modules with @xmath59 integer close on themselves under products , as we see in the fusion rules above , and will see for non - generic @xmath27 below .",
    "this restriction corresponds to the `` oriented loops '' models in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in the continuum limit we consider only the fourier modes of the @xmath44s of wavevectors @xmath76 with @xmath77 fixed , and also consider only states spanned by eigenstates with energies @xmath78 ( measured from the ground state energy ) with @xmath79 fixed .",
    "then the fourier modes of the @xmath44s become the virasoro generators @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , ",
    "the standard modules of the tl algebra , labeled by @xmath59 , become certain modules of the virasoro algebra , which we will also call standard , and which are still labeled by @xmath59 .",
    "these modules are highest weight modules , that is they are generated by the action of the @xmath80s on the state of lowest energy or of lowest @xmath24 eigenvalue in the module .",
    "they are not , however , verma modules , which are constructed from a highest weight state by lowering by @xmath80s with @xmath86 , and using only the commutation relations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the conformal weight @xmath87 of the module , which is the @xmath24 eigenvalue of the highest weight state , takes one of the values @xmath88 at which a null vector ( the highest weight in a submodule ) appears in the verma module , which must be set to zero in order to obtain a simple module . for generic values of the central charge , there is only a single null vector , and only when the conformal weight takes one of the values in the kac table @xcite@xmath89^{2}-1}{4x(x+1)},\\label{kac}\\]]in which @xmath90 is determined by the central charge @xmath91 the generic values of @xmath32 are those where @xmath90 is irrational .",
    "when we take the limit of spin-1/2 chain , the resulting central charge follows from @xmath92 . the conformal weights that occur are @xmath93 in the kac table . in the corresponding verma module ,",
    "the null vector is at conformal weight @xmath94 , hence the virasoro character of the simple modules that appear as direct summands in the @xmath95 limit of the chain are ( the trace is over states in the simple module only)@xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 is a parameter , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the inverse temperature ( the length in the imaginary time direction ) , and @xmath101 is the inverse of the euler partition function , and is related to the dedekind @xmath102 function , @xmath103 thus the partition function of the continuum limit of the xxz chain in the generic case is e^-(h - e_0(l))=tr ^  l_0= _ j=0^(2j+1).here the continuum limit is taken with @xmath97 fixed , after subtracting the ground state energy @xmath104 of the finite-@xmath33 chain from the hamiltonian , and the trace is over all the states of the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "[ we emphasize that this is the ordinary trace on the vector space , not a @xmath27-trace ; it corresponds to what were called the modified partition functions in ref.@xcite . ]",
    "if instead the subtraction were the length times the ground state energy density @xmath105 of the chain as @xmath95 , this expression would be multiplied by @xmath106 .",
    "this is the way we will define the partition function here and in the following : z= e^-(h - e_0(l)l)=tr ^  l_0-c/24= _ j=0^(2j+1).let us note that this partition function can also be obtained by field - theoretic ( rather than algebraic ) means , by bosonizing the spin-1/2 chain or the 6-vertex model , that is , by representing it by a scalar field with a background charge , and taking the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xcite , as a consequence of the null vectors that were set to zero , the operator products of the fields @xmath107 that correspond to the states in the modules decompose according to the fusion rules @xmath108 these clearly correspond to those we inferred from the induction product in the chains , or from the @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) symmetry of the whole construction . in the following we use similar reasoning to infer fusion rules also in the non - generic cases in which representations are not fully decomposable .    in this procedure , we have constructed the fusion product algebraically by joining two chains end to end and taking the continuum limit .",
    "one may wonder whether this really yields the operator product of corresponding local boundary fields in the cft , which is usually pictured as bring points on the boundary together .",
    "we will not discuss this fully , but provide some heuristic arguments .",
    "if we view joining the chains as an event in time , then it corresponds to a picture like that shown in fig.[slitstrip ] , in which the continuum limit has been assumed .",
    "( the chains are shown as equal in length , though more generally the ratio of their lengths can be arbitrary , but is held fixed when the continuum limit is taken . ) if we wish to consider the fusion of states that are @xmath24 eigenstates , for example , then the two initial states may be prepared at early imaginary time @xmath109 , and the matrix element with a desired final state can be taken , by preparing that state at @xmath110 . as conformal transformations move points within the interior of the domain ( and even deform the domain ) , it is natural that the tensor product of two copies of virasoro merges into a single copy of virasoro , as a proper subalgebra .",
    "this occurs because the continuum analog of the extra generator @xmath111 must be included along with the others",
    ". then the corresponding actions of these algebras on the states are related by the induction functor .",
    "thus the use of the induction functor for virasoro is natural in the slit - strip picture ( i.e. , in the operator formalism ) .",
    "the conventional picture of the incoming and outgoing states as corresponding to local fields at a point on the boundary , which are brought together in an ope , is recovered by using a conformal mapping from the slit - strip to the unit disk , or the upper half plane , with the two incoming and one outgoing state(s ) at time @xmath112 represented by points on the boundary .",
    "this conformal mapping is described for example in ref .",
    "incidentally , it has often been remarked in the cft literature that the fusion product is not simply a tensor product of representations of virasoro ( or more generally , the chiral algebra ) .",
    "the fusion product defined as the induction functor for joining strips end to end should agree with the `` deformed tensor product '' defined in some of these references @xcite , at least for the present case of boundary cft .",
    "the states or fields we find in this construction based on the tl algebra at generic @xmath27 correspond to the first column of the kac table .",
    "the first row of the kac table has identical fusion rules , and so one would expect a lattice construction to lead to this theory also . such a model is the o(@xmath113 ) loop model @xcite and its supersymmetric versions @xcite in which the critical theory ( which exists for @xmath114 ) is referred to as the dilute theory , and where another algebra ( essentially a two colour version of the tl algebra ) replaces the tl algebra .",
    "we emphasize that it has the same symmetry as the tl ( dense loops ) model , and that it too comes in two versions , oriented loops ( only integer @xmath115 ) and unoriented loops ( including all integer values of @xmath116 ) .",
    "when @xmath27 is a root of unity ( but @xmath117 ) , we will define @xmath118 to be the smallest integer such that @xmath119 .",
    "the structure of both tl and @xmath28(sl@xmath29 ) changes , and this can be traced to the vanishing of the @xmath27-integers @xmath120_q=(q^n - q^{-n})/(q - q^{-1})$ ] for some @xmath121 for such @xmath27 values : @xmath120_q=0 $ ] for @xmath122 ( mod @xmath123 ) @xcite .    for @xmath27 a root of unity , standard modules of both tl and 2 can be defined , and have the same dimensions @xmath55 , @xmath124 , respectively , as before . however , they are not all irreducible .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath59 such that @xmath125_q=0 $ ] , they remain irreducible , while for other @xmath59 , they contain a proper submodule but are indecomposable . for both algebras ,",
    "the reducible standard modules have the same structure : the largest proper submodule ( or radical ) of the module is irreducible , and the quotient by this submodule is also",
    ". then we will represent the structure of such a module by a diagram like    ccc & & + & -.2 cm & + & & -.3cm[stanmod ]    . here",
    "the open circle represents the states in the simple quotient module or `` top '' ( or `` head '' ) , and the closed circle the simple submodule or `` foot '' .",
    "the arrow represents the action of the algebra ; there is some element of the algebra that maps the top to the foot , but not vice versa , as well as elements that map the top into itself and the foot into itself .",
    "the positions of the circles on the page is not particularly important , as the key information is the arrows and ( for these standard modules ) whether a circle is open or closed .",
    "below , we will also represent the structure of other modules by similar , though more complex , diagrams . in these ,",
    "each circle is a nonzero simple subquotient module , and arrows show the action of the algebra other than within the simple subquotients , with the convention that composites of arrows should also be understood as present implicitly . in our examples , a head and a foot can usually be defined uniquely , but there will be other subquotients in between .",
    "later , the positions of the circles will be replaced by additional information such as the spin or dimension of the simple module in question .",
    "the general rule for the spin values can be given here : for either 2 or tl , we label standard modules by @xmath52 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath33 .",
    "we choose the labels for the simple modules to be @xmath52 , @xmath48 , ",
    ", @xmath33 also ( or in some cases , a subset of these ) . for reducible standard modules of @xmath25sl@xmath26 , the simple module at",
    "the _ top _ has the same value of @xmath59 ; the foot is a simple module isomorphic to a simple module with _ smaller _ @xmath59 . for the tl algebra ,",
    "it is the same , except that the foot has a larger @xmath59 than the head .",
    "when the xxz chain is analyzed for @xmath27 a root of unity , it decomposes under the tl algebra into a direct sum of tl modules .",
    "when analyzed under @xmath25sl@xmath26 , it likewise is a direct sum .",
    "however , in neither case are the direct summands the standard modules just described , except for those standard modules that remain simple at this @xmath27 , some copies of which appear as in the generic cases . for the reducible standard modules , each algebra action mixes them , mapping states from one standard to another @xcite .",
    "the direct summand modules will be referred to as `` tilting '' modules , in the case of either algebra .",
    "( we should point out that non - semisimple algebras typically have infinitely many distinct , i.e.  mutually non - isomorphic , indecomposable modules , even when the algebra is finite dimensional .",
    "it becomes important to explain _ which _ particular types of indecomposable modules are of interest . )",
    "the tilting modules turn out to have a fairly simple structure also , consisting of two standard modules with arrows connecting them , typically in the form :    ccccc & & & & + & -.2cm&&-.2 cm & + -.3cm&&&&-.3 cm + & -.2cm&&-.2 cm & + & & & &    .[tiltmod ] thus , the module is seen to contain a submodule that is a standard module , consisting of an open and a closed circle together with an explicit arrow that connects them .",
    "the quotient by this submodule is also standard .",
    "the detailed structure of all these modules will be exhibited for several important values of @xmath27 ( or @xmath113 ) in the following sections , as will the inter - relation of the commuting tl and 2 actions .",
    "in addition to the tilting modules , other important modules are the projective modules .",
    "projective modules may be defined as occurring as a direct summand in some free module , or in several other equivalent ways .",
    "we will be especially interested in the indecomposable projective modules of the tl algebra . for finite dimensional algebras ,",
    "there is one indecomposable projective module ( up to isomorphism ) corresponding to each distinct simple module ; the latter appears as the top ( the unique simple quotient module ) of this projective module .",
    "this fact makes it fairly straightforward to read off the indecomposable projective modules from the structure of the xxz chain as a direct sum , since the algebra acts faithfully . in many cases ,",
    "the tilting modules are also indecomposable projective modules .    joining chains of lengths @xmath126 , @xmath127 end to end leads to natural operations making a tensor product of modules over 2 into another such module .",
    "these agree with the product operations usually defined for 2 as a quantum group .",
    "this product decomposes as a direct sum of indecomposable modules , and as tilting modules are defined as direct summands in the xxz chain , the tensor product of tilting modules is again tilting .",
    "the fusion rules for the tilting modules are then those of most basic interest ( and are determined by the decomposition of a product of indecomposable tilting modules into indecomposables ) . also , as this product is just the ordinary tensor product operation of vector spaces , the sum of the dimensions of the indecomposables produced is the product of the dimensions of the modules we began with . for @xmath27 a root of unity ,",
    "the fusion rules are however modified from those in the generic cases , and will be discussed in the examples below .    in our previous paper @xcite , we also explained how a product is defined on the tl modules when joined end to end , based on induction as mentioned earlier . in this case , the dimensions of modules are not conserved , but there are again fusion rules .",
    "crucially , the module induced from a tensor product of projective modules of the two short chains is a projective module of the chain of length @xmath128 , and can be decomposed as a direct sum of indecomposable projective modules .",
    "hence we can define fusion rules for products of projective modules , which are again determined by the decomposition of a product of indecomposable projective modules into indecomposable projective modules .",
    "most importantly , the fusion rules for indecomposable projective modules of tl are the _ same _ as those for indecomposable tilting modules of @xmath25sl@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we also discussed previously @xcite how the limit @xmath95 can be taken , both at a purely algebraic level , and focussing on the low - energy states as a continuum limit .",
    "the first can be well - defined mathematically , while the second is presently less rigorous and more heuristic .",
    "for the symmetry structure , given by 2 or a morita equivalent of it , the purely algebraic construction is sufficient , as it yields a limit algebra , which is 2 for the xxz case .",
    "the dimensions of modules are stable as @xmath33 increases , but additional modules appear .",
    "the fusion rules are also given by the finite - dimensional analysis and remain the same as @xmath33 increases [ and in discussing 2 above , it was natural to ignore the distinction between it and its finite - dimensional quotients ] . on the other hand , for the tl algebra , the dimensions of corresponding modules increase with @xmath33 , and there seems to be no purely algebraic way to define the limiting algebra that is suitable for our purposes @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the fusion rules behave stably ( as they are controlled by the symmetry ) . in the purely algebraic limit ,",
    "the limit of a projective module is still a projective object in the limiting category of modules . in the continuum limit",
    ", all evidence suggests that the modules of tl become virasoro modules .",
    "the limits of projective modules will still be referred to as projective , and continue to play an important role . the standard ( resp . ,",
    "tilting ) modules of tl become standard ( resp . ,  tilting ) modules of virasoro , also .",
    "we note that the virasoro algebra may not act faithfully on the limiting space of states .",
    "this is to be expected as the representations that occur as summands are quite restricted , so that the algebra appears smaller  it is a quotient of virasoro .",
    "we can see this already for generic @xmath27 , where the standard modules became the irreducible representations of virasoro that lie in the first column of the kac table .",
    "it is possible that the modules we call projective do obey the general definition of projective modules over this smaller algebra , even if they do not for the virasoro algebra itself .",
    "also , there could in principle be elements of the algebra not in the virasoro algebra ( though this seems unlikely in the spin-1/2 chains and related theories studied here ) .",
    "when @xmath27 is a root of unity , the corresponding central charge is one of the special values of kac and bpz ( in which @xmath90 above is rational ) , at which the standard modules may acquire additional null vectors .",
    "when this occurs , the standard module of virasoro now has the same submodule structure as the standard tl module illustrated above .",
    "the positions in the first column of kac table at which this occurs agree exactly with what we would expect based on the tl algebra .",
    "similarly , we will infer that the projective and tilting virasoro modules relevant to the analysis of the xxz chain ( to operators as well as states , by the state - operator correspondence ) have structures like that above ( when reducible ) .",
    "finally , the fusion rules must be those inferred from finite size systems , and for the projective modules are again the same as for finite size @xmath33 .",
    "these can in turn be obtained from those on the 2 side , which is very convenient as one can use characters there .",
    "this illustrates how symmetry becomes useful in analyzing the structure of a cft .",
    "thus , in the following sections , the ideas of this part will be worked out in several instances of physical or geometric interest .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of the open xxz chain of even length @xmath130 , with @xmath129 , so @xmath30 and @xmath131 .",
    "when the partition function is expanded as a sum over loops , this model assigns a factor @xmath129 to each loop , so describes dense polymers .",
    "this case also corresponds ( by morita equivalence of symmetry algebras ) to the gl(@xmath1 ) supersymmetric chains , and to nonlinear sigma models with target space @xmath132 at a particular value of the coupling constant , as described in ref.@xcite . for @xmath133 , the gl(@xmath12 )",
    "spin chain actually coincides with the 2 or spin-1/2 chain , and both are free fermion systems . in the continuum limit , the latter theory is the free symplectic fermion theory .    the decomposition of the space of states into a sum of indecomposable representations ( tilting modules ) under 2 has been well studied .",
    "it turns out that none of the indecomposable summands are simple ; all are reducible . following the notation described in the previous section , each tilting module @xmath134 has the structure corresponding exactly to that in diagram ( [ tiltmod ] ) @xcite : @xmath135 the nodes correspond to simple modules and are labeled by spin values ; the simple module of spin @xmath136 has dimension @xmath137 .",
    "( nodes with negative spin values are viewed as zero dimensional and can be omitted . ) for some purposes , the module @xmath138 for @xmath52 can also be viewed as a tilting module of 2 but does not occur in the chain because its multiplicity is zero ( this is special to the @xmath129 case ) ; in the present section we will view it also as zero .",
    "each pair of nodes that can be connected by a southwest arrow forms a standard module , as in diagram ( [ tiltmod ] ) .",
    "as advertised , the dimension of the standard module of spin @xmath139 is @xmath140 ; conversely , this together with a knowledge of the structure enables one to calculate recursively the dimensions of the simple modules .",
    "the total dimension of the module is thus @xmath141 .",
    "we emphasize that the same structure applies to the corresponding tilting modules for the enlarged symmetry algebra @xmath142 , by morita equivalence , though the dimensions are different .",
    "similar statements will be true for the symmetry algebras throughout , but will not usually be made explicit .    for @xmath143 ( i.e.  six spins @xmath0 ) for example , the @xmath59 values of the indecomposable summands @xmath134 are @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "the full decomposition of the chain under 2 ( where @xmath147 denotes multiplicities of the indecomposable tilting modules ) is @xmath148 and the check on the dimensions is @xmath149    knowing the decomposition under ( an image of ) @xmath25sl@xmath26 , one can also find directly the structure of the modules of the commutant algebra of 2 in the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "this by definition consists of all endomorphisms ( linear maps of the vector space into itself ) that commute with the 2 action .",
    "when the algebra is semisimple , as for 2 at generic @xmath27 , such endomorphisms can only map a copy of a simple module to another copy of the same one , and so the commutant is also semisimple , and has simple modules of dimensions equal to the multiplicities of the simple modules of the given algebra ( this was used in ref.@xcite ) . for non - semisimple algebras , as here , there are such endomorphisms that map the tilting modules to themselves and which combine to form full matrix algebras .",
    "indeed , the multiplicities of the 2 tilting modules are the dimensions of the simple modules of its commutant .",
    "but there are also endomorphisms that map the indecomposable tilting modules into one another .",
    "this can occur when a tilting module has one or more subquotient modules that also occur in another tilting module .",
    "in fact the `` top '' of the indecomposable tilting module , which is a source but not a sink for arrows , must map onto a non - top part of the other tilting module , and all subquotients that lie below the top must also map such that the arrows are preserved . in most cases ,",
    "the foot of the tilting module , and some subquotients above it , are mapped to zero .",
    "thus the endomorphisms of the space of the spin-1/2 chain can be read off from the structure and multiplicities of the indecomposable tilting modules . for the tl representation in the spin-1/2 chain ,",
    "the commutant algebra of 2 obtained in this way is isomorphic to the tl algebra ; the two algebras form a `` dual pair '' .",
    "( if instead the tl structure were given , one could follow the same procedure to find the structure of the modules of its commutant . )    in the present case , the indecomposable tilting modules @xmath150 have non - trivial homomorphisms into neighboring tilting modules @xmath151 only .",
    "there are also ( for @xmath152 ) non - trivial homomorphisms of @xmath134 into itself , which map the head to the foot , which have the same @xmath59 value .",
    "the commuting actions of 2 and its commutant tl@xmath36 can be represented in a `` staircase '' diagram that generalizes those for 2 or tl separately , shown for @xmath143 in fig .",
    "[ overall ] .",
    "this shows the action of both algebras , and thus the tensor product @xmath25sl@xmath153tl@xmath36 , on the states of the chain .",
    "[ the diagram is the same if we consider @xmath154tl@xmath36 for the supersymmetric chains . ]",
    "the circles at cartesian coordinates @xmath155 represent simple subquotient modules over this product algebra .",
    "@xmath25sl@xmath26 acts by the horizontal arrows ( that is , its action preserves @xmath139 ) , while tl@xmath36 acts `` vertically '' ( that is , preserving @xmath59 ) , and these actions commute ( readers are invited to check that this is consistent , because of the arrangement of the arrows as `` commuting squares '' ) . once again , composites of arrows are arrows that are implicitly present .",
    "each circle is a subquotient module with a multiplicity of one when viewed as a @xmath25sl@xmath153tl@xmath36 module ; some values @xmath155 do occur twice , and those circles have been separated slightly for clarity .",
    "the indecomposable tilting modules of 2 can be recovered by ignoring vertical arrows , and stretching out the components of the diagram to recover the diagrams above .",
    "likewise , the indecomposable tilting modules of the tl algebra are obtained by ignoring the horizontal arrows .",
    "( if we had started knowing those , then we could have obtained the tilting modules for the commutant of tl by a similar procedure as we described . )",
    "we now turn to the structure of these in some examples . for this @xmath129 , @xmath33 integer case ,",

    "( [ tlindec ] ) becomes @xmath159 for general @xmath160 , the pattern is similar , starting with a `` trio '' at @xmath144 , followed by quartets up to @xmath161 , and then a single simple module also at @xmath161 ( here we assign @xmath59 to the tl tilting modules by the @xmath59 of the head ) .    the tilting modules for tl can also be compared with the standard modules .",
    "the standard module labeled @xmath59 for tl@xmath162 consists of the simple modules @xmath59 , @xmath163 , together with the tl action that connects them by an arrow , except for @xmath161 when the simple module is standard and one dimensional ( @xmath164 ) , and @xmath52 where the standard module is simple . for six spins",

    "the indecomposable tilting modules consist of pairs of standard modules `` glued '' together by the action of some tl elements , similarly to @xmath25sl@xmath26 .",
    "when the structure of the tilting modules is known as in ( [ tlindeci ] ) , one can recursively calculate the dimensions @xmath169 of the simple modules of tl , starting from @xmath161 . for @xmath143",

    "usually there is a simple module of tl for @xmath52 , but here for @xmath129 it vanishes .",
    "( this is related with the fact that the partition function of the chain vanishes exactly ) . for general even @xmath130 ,",

    "- jd_jfor @xmath52 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath33 .",
    "we may also consider @xmath25sl@xmath174 and analyze it viewed as a module over itself , acting on the left or on the right ( the left and right regular representations ) , or on both sides ( i.e.  as a @xmath25sl@xmath175sl@xmath174 module , as the actions on the two sides commute ) .",
    "from the last of these , we can then make a similar staircase diagram for @xmath25sl@xmath174 as a module over @xmath25sl@xmath175sl@xmath174 , from which the left or right structure can be determined .",
    "the cellular ideals we reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be readily seen in such a picture , as they form sets of circles and arrows mapped into themselves by the left and right action of @xmath25sl@xmath174 .",

    "of course all of these expressions for the dimensions follow from the independence of the dimensions of the standard modules from @xmath27 , so that the formulas from the generic case always hold .",

    "we will give here the expressions for the ( super-)dimensions of the simple modules of our algebras @xmath183 , @xmath133 , @xmath145 ,  , which are morita equivalent to 2 with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "first we point out that the dimensions @xmath163 of the @xmath59th simple module of 2 can be deduced from the structure of the standard modules , and the dimension @xmath124 of the latter , much like those for tl .",
    "they are obtained from the relations @xmath184 , with dimension @xmath48 for the simple module with @xmath52 , which follow from the existence of simple sub- and quotient modules of the each standard module .",

    "similarly , we may look at the quantum dimensions of the modules ; for the algebra @xmath183 the quantum dimensions are just the superdimensions . for the @xmath59th standard module ,",
    "the superdimensions were denoted @xmath188 in ref .",
    "@xcite , given by @xmath189_q$ ] , which is the same as the @xmath27-dimension for 2 because of the morita equivalence with 2 as ribbon hopf algebras ( here for the algebras with integer @xmath59 only ) @xcite . in the present case , @xmath190 .",
    "the same equality applies to dimensions of other modules such as the simple modules , and thus we can compute the quantum dimensions for 2 ( @xmath30 ) simples and @xmath183 simples as @xmath191_{q^2}$ ] similarly . for the tilting modules , the quantum dimensions are @xmath192 ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ,  ) , and so @xmath193 for all @xmath194 .    for a finite - dimensional algebra ,",
    "the indecomposable summands in the left regular representation are the indecomposable projective ( left ) modules .",
    "thus we can read off the indecomposable projective modules .",
    "for the tl algebra ( for which these are of particular interest ) for @xmath143 , these are the same modules as the three tilting modules other than the singlet",
    ". the singlet can not be an indecomposable projective module as it occurs as a quotient module of an indecomposable tilting module , which is impossible for a projective module ( one of the alternative definitions for a projective module is that whenever it is a quotient of some module , it is isomorphic to a direct summand in that other module ) .",
    "the other three indecomposable tilting modules are acceptable , and are projective as follows automatically if the tl algebra is defined as the commutant of 2 in this chain ( this is an aspect of the key lemma @xcite ; see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "there are no other indecomposable projective modules in the present case ( for the other cases @xmath195 , we will see that there are also projective modules that are not tilting ) .",

    "we now pass to the continuum limit",
    ". our strategy will be to deduce as much as possible from the lattice , and compare with known results from the representation theory of the virasoro algebra .",
    "first , we can consider the purely algebraic limit @xmath95 as discussed in ref .",
    "the staircase diagram then becomes infinite ; see fig .",
    "[ contoverall ] , and the limits of the dimensions @xmath169 of the simple tl modules are also infinite . the more physical way of taking @xmath95 , called the continuum limit @xcite , focusses on low - energy states and the long - wavelength fourier components of the @xmath44s .",
    "we expect that the virasoro algebra emerges from the tl algebra in this limit @xcite , and that the staircase diagram still applies to this .",
    "in addition we will use the known information ( as for the case of generic @xmath27 ) of the values of the central charge and a set of scaling dimensions that are associated with the virasoro modules ( or the scaling fields of the theory ) .",
    "this is done for convenience ; we expect that with some additional effort these may themselves be established purely on the grounds of consistency with the algebraic structure encoded in the staircase diagram , since the structure of the 2 modules is known and is unchanged in the @xmath95 limit .    on specializing the generic results , eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) , ( [ kac ] ) for the central charge and the kac table to @xmath30 , so @xmath203 , one finds that @xmath3 , and the kac formula reads @xmath204 where @xmath123 , @xmath205 are positive integers .",
    "the values appearing in the spectrum are @xmath206 where we used symmetries of the kac formula to restrict to the fundamental domain , and again here @xmath207 is integer .",
    "as the limits of the dimensions of the modules over tl are infinite , it is convenient to use instead the graded dimensions or characters defined using a trace over the module of the exponential of the hamiltonian , or @xmath24 virasoro generator . for the standard modules , which we will denote @xmath208 , these were given in sec .  2 , and for the cases of interest here",
    "are @xmath209 we may point out here that the full partition function of the model in the continuum limit is obtained by specializing the result for generic @xmath27 : z = tr ^",
    "l_0-c/24= _ j=0^(2j+1),which as for the total dimension of the finite length chains is still valid at @xmath30 , even though the modules involved are no longer fully decomposable .",
    "this is similar to the result given for the case @xmath4 in the appendix of ref .",
    "this result may be obtained using field - theoretic methods @xcite , and provides a check on our algebraic deductions .",
    "it is perhaps more natural to calculate a partition function as a quantum trace instead of a trace , which corresponds to a boundary condition in the ( periodic , imaginary ) time direction that does not break the 2 or @xmath183 symmetry . in that case",
    "@xmath124 is replaced by @xmath188 , and the result is valid for the continuum limit of the supersymmetric models as well as that of the spin-1/2 chain @xcite . in the present case @xmath30 , these partition functions ( called `` unmodified '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) vanish identically ( this is also true on the lattice ) .",
    "this follows because we can collect all states into tilting modules of the symmetry algebra , and the quantum dimensions @xmath210 of these tilting modules vanish .",
    "for the modified partition functions of the supersymmetric models , @xmath124 must be replaced by @xmath211 as for the finite-@xmath33 chains .    in studying the representation theory for highest - weight modules of the virasoro algebra , it is conventional to use verma modules .",
    "the verma module generated from the highest weight vector with weight @xmath93 has , for generic central charge , a singular vector at level @xmath212 , with value of the conformal weight @xmath94 .",
    "that is , there is a submodule which is also highest weight with that conformal weight , and vectors in the submodule are orthogonal to all those in the verma module . at @xmath3 ,",
    "another singular vector appears at the lower level @xmath213 , while now @xmath214 .",
    "these submodules in turn contain submodules .",
    "this leads to a picture of verma modules embedded into one another in a sequence , as shown in fig.([vermemb ] ) .",
    "the representations obtained by factoring out from the verma module the submodule generated from the `` generic '' singular vector at level @xmath212 are the standard modules @xmath215 . at @xmath3",
    "this representation is reducible ; from fig .  [ vermemb ] it contains a submodule that is simple , and its structure is described by a diagram of the form ( [ stanmod ] ) .",
    "it possesses an irreducible quotient @xmath216 , with character @xmath217 , and the character of the submodule in @xmath215 is @xmath218 .",
    "hence we have the equality @xmath219 the calculation of @xmath217 from the embedding diagram fig.[vermemb ] is standard , and gives @xmath220 and note that @xmath221 ( the continuum equivalent of the absence of the @xmath222 node in fig .  [ overall ] ) .",
    "this shows that the structure of the standard virasoro modules at @xmath3 parallels that of the finite-@xmath33 tl modules of the same @xmath59 .",
    "we now go a step further and describe the structure of virasoro modules that parallel the indecomposable projective modules of tl ; these will be called indecomposable projective modules of virasoro ( the terminology is subject to caveats already mentioned in the previous section ) .",
    "the modules we want are the continuum limits of the finite-@xmath33 indecomposable projective tl modules . calling these indecomposable projective modules @xmath223",
    ", we expect thus in particular to have the characters @xmath224 the structure of these modules , in the sense of the submodules that appear , is as follows .",
    "all are described by the same diagrams as the corresponding projectives @xmath198 of tl , and all except that for @xmath144 are `` quartets '' since the effects at @xmath161 have disappeared as @xmath95 .",
    "each circle in the diagram is a simple subquotient module , and for the virasoro algebra these are highest weight modules . in more detail , we should first have an irreducible representation @xmath216 generated by a highest weight vector @xmath225 at the `` foot '' ; then a standard submodule @xmath226 generated by a highest weight vector @xmath227 , in which @xmath225 appears as a singular vector .",
    "then a state @xmath228 which forms a two dimensional jordan cell ( of @xmath13 ) with @xmath225 : @xmath229 @xmath228 is not a highest weight vector , and positive modes of virasoro ( i.e.  @xmath80 s with @xmath230 ) map it to descendants of @xmath231 .",
    "finally , there should be a @xmath232 which is technically a sub - singular vector , i.e. it is singular in the quotient by the representation generated by @xmath225 ( in other words , positive modes of virasoro send it to descendants of @xmath225 ) .",
    "this is schematically represented in fig.[repstruc ] , where arrows indicate action of the virasoro algebra .",
    "nodes connected by southeast arrows contribute @xmath233 and @xmath234 to the character ; these correspond to a submodule and a quotient module , both of which are isomorphic to standard modules ; the head and foot of each of these are indicated by the open and closed circles . in the cft ,",
    "these vectors that are highest weights modulo submodules will be the closest that we can come to finding primary fields for the virasoro algebra .    representations with the quartet structure such as @xmath39 have been abstractly studied before and are called staggered modules in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that they depend on one characteristic parameter , which can be defined through the equation @xmath235 we do not know the relevant values of @xmath236 in our models ; it would be interesting to obtain them from the spin-1/2 chain , or from the symplectic fermion field theory discussed below .",
    "presumably our modules are special as they are `` projective . ''",
    "now we interpret the continuum limit using the symplectic fermion representation of the theory .",
    "this follows from writing the spin-1/2 chain , or the supersymmetric formulation for @xmath133 , as a free - fermion system .",
    "the continuum limit can then be taken .",
    "as we consider the open chain case , one must treat the boundary conditions on the fermion fields .",
    "the fermion fields can be viewed as a complex scalar fermion , and its conjugate .",
    "these fermions are partners under a supersymmetry ( graded lie algebra ) of free bosons , and the corresponding continuum free boson theory is a complex scalar boson .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions for the latter were considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , both for the lattice model ( discrete in both space and time directions , and called a network model ) and in the continuum .",
    "hence the boundary condition on the fermions also is a variant of a neumann boundary condition , in which on the boundary , the derivative of the field at some fixed angle ( the `` hall angle '' @xcite ) to the normal to the boundary must vanish ( the hall angle is a free parameter of the theory ) .",
    "this is due to the alternation of the two types of site , in the fundamental and its dual , along the chain when viewed as a representation of gl(@xmath12 ) .",
    "a property of these boundary conditions is that , as for ordinary neumann boundary conditions , when we find the normal modes of the continuum theory on a finite interval , there is a zero mode for the fermion .",
    "indeed , the entire spectrum is independent of the choice of hall angle . for any value of the hall angle",

    "we now discuss fusion of the tilting modules @xmath34 ( of dimension @xmath141 ) labelled by @xmath59 , in other words the clebsch - gordan series for 2 at @xmath30 .",

    "calculations in @xcite are extremely technical , and it is quite remarkable that the results can be derived from fusion of indecomposables of @xmath293sl@xmath294 .    we have concentrated here on the fusion rules for tilting modules on the 2 side , and the projective modules on the tl or virasoro side , as these are the most natural starting point , and there is an equivalence between these fusion products .",
    "one can also derive from these the fusion rules for some other types of modules , such as the standard and simple modules .",
    "one must be careful in using the 2 fusion results on the tl / virasoro side as the equivalence may not always hold for the non - tilting modules .",
    "the general definition of fusion for the tl or virasoro modules is always the module induced from the tensor product by the inclusion of the algebras for two chains into that for a single chain , by joining them end to end .",
    "we emphasize that these fusion rules can be viewed as describing operator products of the conformal fields that transform as virasoro modules discussed here , for example for the symplectic fermions , for which the `` pseudoprimary '' fields were written down earlier , each of which is the primary field in a simple subquotient module .",
    "they also apply to the corresponding fields in the supersymmetric models , where the fields have different multiplicities given by the dimensions @xmath185 . in applications the fusion rules given here will have to be combined with those for the symmetry algebra [ 2 or @xmath183 ) ] , as the fields transform under both algebras .",
    "these combined forms can be obtained in the finite-@xmath33 lattice models , where they come from decomposing tensor products simply as vector spaces ( the multiplicities from the symmetry algebra side make the dimensions of spaces conserved ) , and then the continuum limit can be taken .    as a final note",
    ", we mention that in the case of unoriented loops , we should consider odd as well as even values of @xmath130 .",

    "these standard modules remain simple , both for 2 and ( hence ) also for tl .",
    "they appear then as extra circles interspersed among the integer @xmath59 values in the staircase diagrams , with no extra explicit arrows , so these modules are both tilting and projective also .",
    "fusion rules for products involving these can be found along the same lines as for @xmath296 , @xmath297 integer ( the fusion rules for a product of @xmath296 with @xmath297 both integers are unchanged , and still close on integer @xmath59 only ) . in terms of dense polymers ,",
    "the unoriented - loops model contains local boundary fields for odd as well as even numbers of legs , the number of legs being ( as always for the loop models ) @xmath295 for fields in a standard module of spin @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we follow a similar procedure as in the previous one , for the xxz chain of even length @xmath130 with @xmath298 , so @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the loop model describes dense , oriented loops which can be identified with the boundaries of clusters in percolation at the critical percolation threshold . in the spin chains with gl(@xmath2 ) supersymmetry @xcite ,",
    "the continuum limit in this case corresponds to the fixed - point theory of the @xmath299 nonlinear sigma model at @xmath23 , with the enlarged symmetry algebra @xmath300 that is morita equivalent to 2 with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath133 case is thus connected with the spin quantum hall transition also @xcite . because the tl algebra for @xmath301 is isomorphic to that for @xmath113 , the first , algebraic part of",
    "the analysis is the same for the @xmath302 finite-@xmath33 spin chain for that case also , up to a change in sign of the hamiltonian . because of the latter sign change",
    ", a distinct continuum limit is obtained for @xmath302 which is not considered in this section .",
    "we note that since the chain has even length , only integer spins @xmath59 occur , and for these the symmetry algebras 2 and @xmath303sl@xmath26 are isomorphic .",
    "we start with the analysis of the spin-1/2 chain under @xmath293sl@xmath294 . for @xmath31 , so @xmath304 , and the representations depend on @xmath124 modulo @xmath146 , instead of modulo @xmath145 as in the previous case . the standard modules for @xmath207 with @xmath305 ( mod 3 ) remain irreducible .",
    "the remaining standard modules for @xmath152 become reducible in the manner described for all roots of unity , and the corresponding tilting modules ( which are the direct summands in the spin-1/2 chain ) contain a submodule and a quotient module that are standard , and which have adjacent @xmath59-values if the values @xmath305 ( mod 3 ) are skipped . similarly , the @xmath59 values assigned to the simple subquotient modules of the standard modules are also adjacent if the values @xmath306 ( mod 3 ) are skipped , and the value at the head is the same as the value for the standard module .",
    "the standard module for @xmath52 is one dimensional , and so is simple , and also appears as a summand in the chain .",
    "thus the tilting modules have the following structure @xcite : t_j :  \\ {    cl    ccccc & & -.7cmj-1 & & + & -.2 cm & & + j-3&&&-.3cmj + & -.2 cm & & + & & -.7cmj-1 & &    & + & + j & + & +    ccccc & & -.7cmj-2 & & + & -.2 cm & & + j-3&&&-.3 cm j + & -.2 cm & & + & & -.7 cm j-2 & &    &    . for @xmath52 , @xmath48 ,  , @xmath33 . here again , simple subquotient modules labeled @xmath307 are understood to be zero and can be omitted . in the reducible modules , the pairs connected by southwest arrows",

    "thus in terms of dimensions of the simple subquotients , we have for the two non - trivial classes : @xmath316 the @xmath27-dimensions , and the dimensions and superdimensions of the standard and tilting modules over @xmath300 , can be calculated similarly , as we showed in the case of @xmath129 .",

    "the remaining indecomposable tilting modules [ including those standard modules with @xmath306 ( mod3 ) which are simple ] are also projective , and there is one additional projective module for @xmath52 , that has a ( different ) singlet at the top .",

    "this is connected with a well - known phenomenon in these loop models : the dilute model possesses a low-@xmath18 phase that is in the same universality class as the dense model . yet the dilute model has non - vanishing partition function ( here it is the `` unmodified '' partition function , defined using the @xmath27-trace in the transfer matrix approach , that we mean ) , but that of the dense model vanishes for @xmath129 .",
    "the discrepancy is resolved because the state with no polymer loops exists in the dilute model , and produces the nonzero partition function , but there is no such configuration in the dense model . in the dense phase of the dilute model",
    ", this state occurs at high energy and is dropped in the continuum limit , so the partition function ( in which energies of the spin chain are measured from the ground state energy ) becomes zero .",
    "this configuration with no loops corresponds to the state of the chain at @xmath222 in the staircase diagram for @xmath129 .    as we do not consider the lattice algebraic formulation in detail here",
    ", we pass directly to the continuum theory at the critical point for @xmath129 .",
    "the staircase diagram is shown in fig.[polyrep ] .",
    "it has the same form as the dense polymer case , except that the circle at @xmath222 is now included .",
    "the 2 structure is the same as for dense polymers , and we include the @xmath295 odd cases for the unoriented case",
    ". here the singlet tilting module @xmath138 does appear with nonzero multiplicity in the chain .",
    "for the supersymmetric models , the symmetry algebra for the unoriented loops case is called @xmath392 in ref.@xcite .    on the virasoro side ,",
    "the conformal weights are taken from the first _ row _ of the @xmath4 kac table , so @xmath393 the characters of the standard modules read @xmath394 using standard character formulas we check the identities @xmath395 similar to the @xmath129 dense case .",
    "the partition function of the continuum limit of the spin one chain is again given by z= _ j=0^(2j+1 ) .",
    "for the @xmath27-trace instead of the trace , one replaces @xmath124 by @xmath189_q$ ] with @xmath30 ( thus @xmath190 for @xmath59 integer , @xmath396 for @xmath59 half - integer ) , which also gives the unmodified partition function of the supersymmetric models with symmetry algebra @xmath392 @xcite .",
    "the latter is simply @xmath397 by the euler identity .",
    "for the `` modified '' partition function of the supersymmetric models , one instead replaces @xmath124 by the dimensions @xmath181_{q'}$ ] , where @xmath182 for these models ( see appendix b in ref.@xcite ) . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the supersymmetry algebra is isomorphic to @xmath25sl@xmath26 , as in the dense case .",
    "projective modules for virasoro are also similar to the dense case in structure , but now there is also @xmath286 for @xmath52 , which is just a standard module , similarly to the @xmath298 ( percolation ) case .",
    "it has the identity operator at its head , and the stress tensor @xmath18 as the highest weight in the foot submodule .",
    "these fields are also part of the @xmath398 module , similarly to percolation ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "fusion rules for @xmath152 are as for dense polymers . in the fusion of tilting modules of 2 ( or projective modules of virasoro ) for @xmath296 with @xmath399 ( and @xmath400 ) , the term @xmath138 ( resp . , @xmath286 )",
    "is again absent , even though the corresponding modules are nonzero ; this applies for @xmath401 odd as well as even .",
    "@xmath138 behaves as the identity for the fusion rules : t_0_j = t_jfor all @xmath207 , and similarly for fusion of @xmath286 with @xmath268 .",
    "we note that the identity field occurs within the @xmath398 module ( unlike the dense case ) , and so conformally - covariant correlation functions can be produced .",
    "in this section , some physical discussion is given , by writing the algebraic statements in terms of operator products .",
    "the discussion is mainly for @xmath4 , and makes contact with that of gurarie and ludwig @xcite .",
    "we also make some remarks on the role of fields of weight 1 in the boundary theories .",
    "the case @xmath4 has probably been the most discussed in the literature on logarithmic cfts .",
    "there , the existence of the `` @xmath32-catastrophe '' ( i.e. , poles in @xmath402 in opes as @xmath403 ) led gurarie @xcite to the introduction of a _ logarithmic partner _",
    "@xmath19 for the stress energy tensor , satisfying the opes ( up to non - divergent terms ) : @xmath404 notice that @xmath18 is primary , but has a vanishing two - point function , while @xmath19 is not primary .",
    "the @xmath405 ope itself is more complicated and starts with a logarithm : @xmath406 it follows from these equations that @xmath407 form a size two jordan cell for @xmath13 : @xmath408 gurarie went on to suggest that @xmath18 , @xmath19 were part of a `` susy '' multiplet containing at least two weight - two primary operators with non - vanishing two - point functions @xcite",
    ".    the foregoing algebraic analysis of our @xmath4 lattice models gives rise immediately to the existence of @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , for the continuum limit of the chain , the virasoro tilting module that contains the identity and the stress tensor is @xmath409 each simple subquotient module @xmath410 that appears is a highest weight module , so ( by the correspondence of states and operators ) there is a corresponding pseudoprimary field .",
    "all these states have multiplicity 1 .",
    "thus the pseudoprimary fields consist of the identity with conformal weight @xmath411 , two fields with weight @xmath412 , and one with dimension @xmath413 .",
    "one of those with dimension 2 ( the bottom field , as it is primary ) is naturally identified with the stress energy tensor @xmath18 , and should form a jordan cell with its logarithmic partner - here the top field ( with conformal weight 2 ) which we identify with @xmath19 .",
    "the whole indecomposable representation is generated by acting on @xmath19 with the virasoro algebra .",
    "we now see that there is a fourth member of the multiplet of fields , which we call @xmath414 , and which has conformal weight @xmath413 .",
    "we recall that this module can be analyzed into a submodule that is standard , and which is generated by the descendants of @xmath48 , and a quotient module that is also standard , and the quotient module is generated by @xmath19 .",
    "the arrow from @xmath415 to @xmath416 corresponds to the fact that @xmath19 is not primary , and can be mapped to the identity under the action of virasoro generators - this is directly related with the existence of the number @xmath21 in the second ope ( [ ttope ] ) .",
    "the arrow from @xmath415 to @xmath417 indicates that the second ope in ( [ ttope ] ) must be extended to include the field of dimension @xmath418 : t(z)t(0)~+++  + z c_tt^(0 )  where @xmath419 is some coefficient .",
    "@xmath414 is not primary , but only maps to descendents of @xmath18 under action of virasoro with positive modes : t(z)(0)~+  .modulo the virasoro submodule generated by @xmath18 in this way , the field @xmath414 is simply the null virasoro descendent of @xmath19 that occurs in the virasoro standard module when @xmath4 ; it must not be set to zero .",
    "the possible supersymmetry multiplet of fields of weight 2 @xcite may be compared with the 2 multiplet structure ( horizontal in our diagrams ) . for the weight 2 fields for the @xmath298 theory ,",
    "this is the @xmath384 tilting module ( or its morita equivalent in the supersymmetric theories @xcite ) , which has the trio form    ccc 0 & + & -.2 cm + & & -.3cm2 + & -.2 cm + 0 &    in terms of the spin labels which are @xmath52 , @xmath145 ( for the @xmath298 theory ) .",
    "this is in agreement with their expectations , since our node @xmath250 is a multiplet , not a single field .",
    "what plays the role of supersymmetry in our case is @xmath293sl@xmath294 or the @xmath420 symmetry algebra @xcite , which is represented acting horizontally on fig .",
    "the dimension of the space of fields of conformal weight two in our supersymmetric models turns out to be : @xmath421 ( for the limit of the spin-1/2 chain , it is @xmath422 . ) the basic doublet @xmath19 , @xmath18 is thus completed by a large number ( the preceding number minus 2 , called @xmath423 ) of other fields with @xmath20 , which themselves lie in the @xmath424 piece of another virasoro indecomposable of structure @xmath425 the whole picture is thus considerably more involved than in ref.@xcite .",
    "a similar discussion applies to the dilute polymer case .",
    "the virasoro tilting module containing the identity and the stress tensor is then @xmath426 and the arrow from @xmath427 to @xmath415 indicates that in this case the ope ( [ ttope ] ) must be extended to include a field of dimension 7 , similar to @xmath414 ; it is a virasoro descendant that is a null vector , but must not be set to zero .",
    "we have for the supersymmetric models @xmath428 for the 2 theory , this number is @xmath429 , so that it indeed turns out to be simply a quartet of fields , and as @xmath30 these can be viewed as a supersymmetry multiplet also , by putting @xmath133 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that reducible but indecomposable modules of virasoro of the forms we find are in general characterized by dimensionless parameters measuring the `` mixing '' of representations , and that the number @xmath21 of gurarie @xcite appears simply as a particular case of what might be an infinite set of parameters .",
    "clearly , a more detailed analysis of indecomposables at @xmath4 along the lines of @xcite would be useful here .",
    "but it is also important to understand how features of the lattice models determine the values of these parameters in our cases .",
    "gurarie and ludwig @xcite also advocated viewing the operator product algebra generated by @xmath19 and @xmath18 as a kind of chiral algebra .",
    "but we now see that we must introduce @xmath414 as a further field , and the fusion rules for this multiplet with itself produce fields in higher-@xmath59 projective modules .",
    "that is , they generate by repeated ope s not only the full set of integer - weight fields , which would then need to be included in the chiral algebra ( and which are not all singlets under the symmetry algebra ) , but also for @xmath298 the non - integer weight fields . in the oriented @xmath129 and @xmath298 theories ,",
    "this space of fields corresponds to the full space of states !",
    "this argument ignored the role of the symmetry algebra in the actual fields , which after all carry representations of the symmetry algebra also .",
    "this might restrict the fields actually produced in iterated ope s .",
    "however , it seems unfair to omit the fields related to @xmath19 and @xmath18 by symmetry from such a chiral algebra .",
    "the fields related by symmetry include some in the @xmath430 virasoro projective module , and fusion of these produces higher @xmath59 s .",
    "thus it seems inescapable that all integer @xmath59 fields , including those with fractional weights , must be in such a chiral algebra . in cases such as the dilute unoriented polymers",
    ", there are also fields with @xmath295 odd , and all of these together should probably be viewed as making up a single representation of this large chiral algebra .",
    "( thus , the structure of the modules over this larger algebra resembles that of the level - one su(2 ) affine lie algebra theory at @xmath431 , of which the 2 theories are a deformation . ) to us , it does not seem likely to be helpful to try to view this as a chiral algebra .",
    "instead , the maximal chiral algebra ( in the strict sense of containing only integer - weight fields ) of these boundary theories seems to be the virasoro algebra . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry analysis seems powerful .",
    "finally , we turn to another issue : we point out that neither of the boundary cfts with @xmath4 possesses any fields with @xmath432 .",
    "the bulk theories in the supersymmetric formulation do possess such fields of weights @xmath433 and @xmath434 @xcite , and they transform in the adjoint representation of the algebras gl(@xmath435 ) and osp(@xmath389 ) , respectively in the two examples .",
    "the existence of these fields is required by noether s theorem .",
    "( despite the conformal weights , these currents are not generally ( anti-)holomorphic , implying that logarithms will appear in their correlators , and they do not generate affine lie algebras @xcite ) . in the boundary theory , on the other hand , while there are global symmetries , there is in general no such thing as a divergenceless boundary current , because charge can escape into the bulk , and noether s theorem only implies the existence of bulk currents .",
    "thus in general there need not be any corresponding weight-1 fields in the boundary cft .",
    "on the other hand , a more fruitful point of view about such fields is that weight one fields on the boundary correspond to marginal perturbations of the boundary theory , while boundary fields of weight less than one are relevant perturbations on the boundary . in particular ,",
    "exactly marginal perturbations of the boundary theory correspond to the possibility of a continuous change of conformally - invariant boundary conditions . for the @xmath4 theories studied here",
    ", we learn that there are no marginal boundary perturbations , and the only relevant perturbations transform in representations of the symmetry algebra that do not contain any singlets .",
    "thus such a perturbation would necessarily break the global symmetry .    on the other hand ,",
    "for the @xmath3 theories , there are a number of weight 1 fields , transforming in a @xmath384 tilting module for @xmath25sl@xmath26 , or a corresponding tilting module for @xmath436 .",
    "for symplectic fermions , there are 8 such fields .",
    "one of the fields in the @xmath250 subquotient is the boundary term that corresponds to the bulk `` topological '' term in the sigma model , and corresponds to changing the hall angle in the boundary condition discussed in sec .",
    "this gives a line of boundary conditions that preserve conformal invariance on the boundary .",
    "however , as we noted above , these theories can be transformed onto one another by a duality rotation , so this perturbation is `` redundant '' .",
    "the behavior under all the other perturbations is currently not known to us .",
    "the analysis we have presented can be extended to the case of other values of @xmath27 a root of unity , in relation with loop models .",
    "it can also be extended to other boundary conditions for open chains , which lead generically to standard modules with @xmath88 , @xmath118 using results from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ; see also ref .  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the patterns are quite similar , in particular the reducible indecomposable projective virasoro modules usually have the quartet form .",
    "while this paper and its companion were being completed , an interesting preprint appeared on the archive @xcite which has some overlap with our analysis of the dense polymers case . in this reference ,",
    "some of the fusion rules of the conformal field theory are conjectured based on a diagrammatic interpretation of fusion within the tl algebra .",
    "our paper provides the correct algebraic framework to understand the observations of @xcite , together with the tools allowing immediate generalization to all roots of unity cases .",
    "we also would like to mention the recent work @xcite where 2 at roots of unity is used to build indecomposable representations of chiral @xmath437-algebras .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the theories we are considering are not rational ( though most likely quasi - rational ) and we do not think the results of @xcite apply to our case .",
