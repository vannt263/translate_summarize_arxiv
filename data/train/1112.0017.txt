    "rather , close - in giant planets are the most easily detectable variety for doppler and transit surveys owing to the large reflex motions and transit depths they induce . once found to transit their host stars , their relatively large atmospheric cross - sections make them favorable targets for various follow - up studies to measure planet properties such as atmospheric composition , atmospheric temperature profiles , phase curves , and spin - orbit angles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while only one in every hundred sun - like stars harbors a close - in gas giant planet , the occurrence of hot jupiters is even further depressed around the galaxy s most numerous denizens , the m dwarfs .",
    "this empirical finding has emerged from various doppler surveys of m dwarfs , which have detected zero close - in giant planets among roughly 300 target stars with masses @xmath8  , despite the ready detectability of the large doppler amplitudes of these short - period giants @xcite .",
    "this lack of hot jupiters around m dwarfs , as well as the overall dearth of giant planets around low - mass stars , is likely due to the inefficiency of the planet - formation process within low - mass protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "this notion is further bolstered by the elevated occurrence of giant planets around stars more massive than the sun @xcite .    to date ,",
    "no planet more massive than @xmath9  has been discovered around an m dwarf with a period less than 30 days .",
    "however , orbital companions at either mass extreme have been detected around m dwarfs , and some have been found to transit their stars . at the high - mass end , two transiting brown dwarfs have been found by the _ mearth _ and  transit surveys , respectively @xcite .",
    "at the other end of the mass scale , transits of the rv - detected , short - period neptune gl436b were detected by ground - based follow - up photometry @xcite , and the _ mearth _ survey discovered a transiting super earth orbiting the nearby , low - mass star gj1214 @xcite .",
    "however , no close - in planet with a mass intermediate to those previous discoveries has been found around an m dwarf .",
    "this leaves a gap in the companion - mass continuum that spans more than two orders of magnitude , from @xmath9  to 30  .",
    "one of the planet candidates discovered by the _",

    "@xcite reported a transit depth of @xmath10% and a period of @xmath11 days for the planet candidate .",
    "the large transit depth and lack of a visible secondary eclipse , together with the lack of a pixel shift in the stellar position during transit , reduces the _ a priori _ probability that the transit is a false - positive to @xmath12% @xcite .",
    "however , it is nonetheless desirable and prudent to acquire a full suite of follow - up observations to rule out a false positive .",
    "we also characterize the stellar characteristics of the low - mass host star in order to accurately and precisely measure the properties of the planet .",
    "this contribution thus builds on the work of @xcite , hereafter paper 1 , who presented a spectroscopic analysis of all of the m dwarf kois announced by @xcite .",

    "this suggests that the system is relatively young , similar in age to the hyades .",
    "we have generated a more detailed estimate of koi-254 s age using the gyrochronology relations derived by @xcite .",
    "these relations express a star s current day rotation period as a function of its convective turnover timescale and rotation period on the zams . to calibrate our estimate , we adopted the relationship between a star s mass and convective turnover time as tabulated by @xcite , and calculated three age estimates assuming the zams rotation periods required to reproduce the spread of rotation rates observed for @xmath1530.6  @xmath154 stars in the 600 myr praesepe open cluster @xcite . assuming a zams rotation period of 2.81 days , as required to reproduce the median rotation period for @xmath155 praesepe members , the @xcite gyrochrone relations predict an age of @xmath153780 myrs from the 15.8 day rotation period of .",
    "however , a considerable range of periods are observed for praesepe members in the mass range : adopting the zams rotation periods required to reproduce the 10th and 90th percentile rotation periods observed for 0.6  @xmath154 stars in praesepe indicates that s age could plausibly be as low as 380 myrs or as old as 1.5 gyrs .",
    "this estimate relies on the assumption that the rotational evolution of koi 254 hasnt been grossly affected by tidal effects due to its hot jupiter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from its measured proper motion of @xmath156  mas / yr @xcite and our derived distance of  @xmath157  pc , the system s tangential velocity is a moderate @xmath158  km / s .",
    "while deriving kinematic ages for individual star systems is unreliable , the space motion of  indicates that it s age is consistent with 0.5  gyr .",
    "we report the detection of a short - period , jupiter - mass planet that transits an early m - type dwarf star .",
    "the host star has mass @xmath159  and a radius @xmath160  , which we measure using a new method that draws upon broadband optical and nir photometry , together with various empirical calibrations of m dwarf properties . using our estimated stellar parameters , we find that the planet has a period of  days , a mass @xmath161  , and a radius @xmath2  . at the planet s semimajor axis of  au and given",

    "examination of the tabulated theoretical planetary radii computed by @xcite for an age of 0.3  gyr and stellar insolation equal to that of b shows that our measured planet radius is consistent with model expectations , but only for a core mass of @xmath163  . for the 1  gyr models",
    "a 25  core is necessary to reproduce the observed radius .",
    "this is a remarkably large core mass ( heavy element content ) and conforms well with the observed correlation between planetary heavy element content and host star metallicity @xcite .",
    "this in turn agrees with observations to date that suggest that the formation of a jupiter - mass planet around a low - mass star requires high metallicity @xcite .    as a jupiter - mass planet with a period less than 10  days",
    ", b is the sole example of a hot jupiter orbiting an m dwarf .",
    "more than 300 stars have been monitored in various radial velocity surveys and a planet with @xmath164  days has not been found around an m - type dwarf , despite the large expected doppler signal . indeed , a planet such as b would be readily detectable in any of the past and present m dwarf doppler surveys conducted over the past 15 years ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the difficulties associated with photometrically monitoring a large sample of m dwarfs , and the paucity of giant planets around low - mass stars , this fortuitous  detection may serve as our lone example of a hot jupiter around an m dwarf for some time to come .",
    "inspection of the locations of low - mass dwarfs in the @xmath165@xmath166 color - color diagram reveals a dramatic increase in the width of the main sequence beyond @xmath167 , corresponding to the onset of strong molecular band heads characteristic of the m spectral type ( figure  [ fig : colorcolor ] ) .",

    "this color ",
    "metallicity effect has been noted previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason for the effect is most likely due to changes in continuous opacities due to molecular species such as h@xmath168 , h@xmath169 , he@xmath169 , h@xmath170 and c@xmath169 @xcite .",
    "additionally , sources of line opacity can be seen in the spectral standards compiled by @xcite .",
