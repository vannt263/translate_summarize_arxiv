    "<S> substitution of re for ru in the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath0si@xmath0 suppresses the hidden order transition and gives rise to ferromagnetism at higher concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the hidden order transition of uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 , tracked via specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements , decreases in temperature and broadens , and is no longer observed for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a critical scaling analysis of the bulk magnetization indicates that the ferromagnetic ordering temperature and ordered moment are suppressed continuously towards zero at a critical concentration of @xmath4 , accompanied by the additional suppression of the critical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 towards zero . </S>",
    "<S> this unusual trend appears to reflect the underlying interplay between kondo and ferromagnetic interactions , and perhaps the proximity of the hidden order phase .    for well over two decades , the identity of the ordered phase found in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 at temperatures below 17  k has eluded researchers . this hidden order </S>",
    "<S> ( ho ) phase coexists with a heavy fermion state , but yields to a superconducting ground state below 1.5  k. in order to develop a better understanding of the ho phase , uru@xmath0si@xmath0 has been extensively studied by various techniques , and these efforts have uncovered fascinating behavior under magnetic field , applied pressure , and chemical substitution . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the novel phase changes induced by re substitution for ru , including the suppression of the ho transition , the nearby emergence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) order , and the unique critical behavior of this phase .    </S>",
    "<S> chemical substitution studies have been used primarily to investigate the robustness of the ho phase , and substitutions have been made for all three elements in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . replacing u with th or rare earths </S>",
    "<S> quickly suppresses the ho transition temperature @xcite , emphasizing the critical role of the u _ </S>",
    "<S> f_-electrons to the ho phase . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , substitution for si has no dramatic effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the neighboring elements of ru : mn , tc , th , re , os , rh , and ir have been substituted onto the ru site , and in all cases except os , the ho transition is suppressed by about 5% substituent concentration @xcite .    for a few elements , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams at higher concentrations have been studied . in the rh case , in addition to the ho phase , there are two other nominally antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases , which are separated by nonmagnetic regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the ho , these afm phases are characterized by a larger moment @xcite , and a complex magnetic structure exists at intermediate rh concentrations @xcite . a closer examination of the ho phase found that for almost half of the range of rh concentration over which the ho phase exists , the order is actually afm @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> substituting into uru@xmath0si@xmath0 with re , tc , or mn leads instead to ferromagnetic ( fm ) order  @xcite , whose discovery constituted the first experimental realization of a heavy fermion fm instability . in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> a maximum @xmath7  k is found at @xmath8 , near the concentration limit below which the material remains single phase . </S>",
    "<S> the itinerant fm order is characterized by a small moment , with no anomalies in electrical resistivity or specific heat at @xmath9 . across the re - substitution series , the heavy fermion state is reflected in an enhanced electronic contribution to the specific heat @xcite and a narrow drude peak in optical conductivity at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the long range nature of the fm phase has been confirmed by neutron scattering @xcite and @xmath10si nmr @xcite . within the fm phase , non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior </S>",
    "<S> is observed in the low - temperature bulk properties @xcite and in energy - temperature scaling of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the nfl effects remains an open question , partly because it has been difficult to conclusively define the fm phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> as only polycrystalline samples have been studied so far , it is also necessary to exclude orientational averaging or grain boundary effects as causes for these unusual properties .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of uru@xmath1re@xmath11si@xmath12 were synthesized via the czochralski technique in a tri - arc furnace , and subsequently annealed in ar . </S>",
    "<S> phase homogeneity was verified by powder x - ray diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> samples were oriented via the back - reflection laue method and spark cut and sanded to size . </S>",
    "<S> electrical resistivity measurements as a function of temperature @xmath13 were performed in a liquid @xmath14he cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of magnetization in field @xmath15 were made using a quantum design magnetic properties measurement system ( mpms ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the specific heat @xmath16 were performed in a @xmath17he refrigerator utilizing a semi - adiabatic heat pulse technique .    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ho ] , in the vicinity of the ho transition , the @xmath13 data exhibit a small peak , qualitatively similar to that seen in elemental cr at the ordering transition into a spin density wave . </S>",
    "<S> the transition into the ho phase is marked by a large specific heat anomaly , which is related to the incomplete gapping of the fermi surface in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general shape of these anomalies persists despite a suppression of the ordering temperature as @xmath18 increases , suggesting that the transition into the ho state always involves a fermi surface instability . as re concentration increases </S>",
    "<S> , the anomalies shrink in height and broaden in width , becoming more poorly defined near @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , no ho anomaly can be identified in @xmath13 or @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> isotherms of @xmath15 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mh ] for uru@xmath22re@xmath23si@xmath12 , which orders ferromagnetically below approximately 5  k. as the re concentration increases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the magnitude of the magnetization increases , the isotherms become more sharply curved and hysteresis develops , which is clearly shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mh ] . although the parent compound uru@xmath12si@xmath12 exhibits linear @xmath15 in this field range , in uru@xmath1re@xmath11si@xmath12 , the isotherms exhibit gentle curvature , which does not saturate . </S>",
    "<S> despite the dramatic increase of the low-@xmath26 magnetization with re concentration , even at @xmath25 , well within the fm state , the moment is a small fraction of the high - temperature paramagnetic effective moment of approximately 3.8  @xmath27 .    to analyze @xmath15 data from single crystals , a critical scaling approach based on the arrott - noakes equation of state </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been employed . </S>",
    "<S> this approach does not assume mean - field behavior , and yields values of @xmath9 , the ordered moment @xmath28 and the magnetic critical exponents @xmath29 , @xmath5 , and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the three exponents are defined in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and reduced temperature @xmath33 by @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> only two exponents are independent , as @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistent determination of their values requires agreement between three different analyses : an initial estimate of @xmath30 and @xmath41 made by identifying the isotherm with constant power - law behavior over the widest range of @xmath32 ; scaling in @xmath42 vs @xmath43 , i.e. , the collapse of @xmath15 data onto two diverging curves , for @xmath39 and @xmath35 ; and modified arrott plots of @xmath44 vs @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ scaling ] exhibits the results of the scaling analysis for the @xmath15 data measured on uru@xmath22re@xmath23si@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis has been applied successfully to samples with @xmath46 , which demonstrates the existence of fm order in this range of re concentration @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exponents ] , it is apparent that the @xmath18-dependence of the exponents is linear for all @xmath46 , but the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath28 can be fit to a line only for @xmath47 . in uru@xmath1re@xmath11si@xmath12 , @xmath9 , @xmath48 , @xmath5 and @xmath49 all extrapolate to @xmath50 at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first documented example of such a trend . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents deviate substantially from mean - field values and values describing classical fm transitions , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . near the quantum phase transition , as @xmath18 decreases , @xmath54 as the @xmath15 isotherms ( at @xmath55 ) become less curved . because @xmath29 remains constant , @xmath56 , implying a sharpening of the curvature of the divergent susceptibility at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> while this behavior looks like a trend towards a first - order transition , note the simultaneous suppression of the order parameter @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the re concentration dependence of the ho and fm phases in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phasediagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the ho transition can only be determined for @xmath57 , the ho phase boundary does extrapolate to 0  k near @xmath4 , where it might meet the fm phase at a multicritical point . </S>",
    "<S> there is no direct evidence yet that the ho and fm phases meet , but it has been observed that afm correlations and magnetic excitations associated with the hidden order phase persist to @xmath58 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations provide a plausible explanation for the unusual critical behavior of the fm ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> another possible cause is a competition between magnetic order and the heavy fermion state in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the details of this interplay are not certain , nor is it known whether itinerant fm arises from a light band or a heavy band in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> fm kondo lattice models for both light and heavy magnetic bands are consistent with the measured enhanced specific heat @xcite . also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phasediagram ] is the range of @xmath18 over which nfl behavior has been observed @xcite , which appears to coincide with the fm ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> there is some correlation between the nfl effects and the novel critical behavior : power - law exponents describing unconventional @xmath26-dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite are in good agreement with values of @xmath5 determined by the scaling analysis , implying that they actually describe the same phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall phase diagram of uru@xmath1rh@xmath2si@xmath0 @xcite differs significantly from that of uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phasediagram ] ) , despite similar suppression of the ho phase at low @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas uru@xmath1rh@xmath2si@xmath0 appears to only support afm order , the long - range magnetic order in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 is fm . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature scales differ rather dramatically between the two phase diagrams , as well . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at high rh concentrations , afm order sets in at @xmath59  k , whereas in the re phase diagram , @xmath41 reaches only @xmath60  k. it is interesting that the intermediate afm phase of uru@xmath1rh@xmath2si@xmath0 , characterized by a multi-@xmath61 domain structure @xcite , persists over roughly the same range as the nfl behavior does in the re case . </S>",
    "<S> the complex magnetic structure in uru@xmath1rh@xmath2si@xmath0 and the afm - like correlations in the fm phase of uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 @xcite suggest that in both cases , competing magnetic correlations in this range of @xmath18 play an important role in determining the magnetic structure . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is whether the ho phase in uru@xmath1re@xmath2si@xmath0 gives way to an afm phase , as it does in the rh case @xcite .    </S>",
