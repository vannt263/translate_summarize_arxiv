    "observations with the x - ray observatories _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have led to the discovery of absorption features in the thermal spectra of several isolated ( nonaccreting ) neutron stars ( nss ) . studying such features , one could infer the chemical composition , magnetic field , and gravitational redshift at the ns surface , but identification of the features is rather complicated , mostly because of the effects of the a priori unknown ns magnetic field on radiative transitions in the x - ray range .",
    "first absorption features in the spectrum of an isolated ns , centered at about 0.7 and 1.4 kev , were discovered by sanwal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in _ chandra _ observations of 1e1207.45209 ( hereafter 1e1207 ) , which is the central compact object ( cco ) of the supernova remnant ( snr ) pks 120951/52 .",
    "similar to other ccos ( pavlov et al .  2002 , 2004 ; de luca 2008 ; halpern & gotthelf 2010 ) , 1e1207 does not show the usual pulsar activity , such as radio and @xmath7-ray emission or a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "this ns has the period @xmath8 s ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ) and shows a thermal - like x - ray spectrum ( @xmath93 mk , depending on the model ; zavlin et al .",
    "further observations with _ xmm - newton _ suggested the presence of two more features , at 2.1 and 2.8 kev ( bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "as the energies of the spectral features are harmonically spaced , it seems natural to interpret them as ( gravitationally redshifted ) electron cyclotron line and its harmonics ( e.g. , due to the `` resonance cyclotron scattering '' , by analogy with accreting x - ray pulsars ; bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) , formed in the magnetic field @xmath10 g , where @xmath11 is the electron cyclotron energy , and @xmath12 is the gravitational redshift .",
    "this estimate for the magnetic field is consistent with the upper limit @xmath13 g obtained by gotthelf & halpern ( 2007 ) from the upper limit on the pulsar s period derivative @xmath14 .",
    "however , the cyclotron harmonic interpretation encounters a serious problem because the ratio of the emissivities ( or oscillator strengths ) of consecutive harmonics is known to be proportional to the parameter @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , pavlov et al .  1980a , b ) , i.e.",
    ", the emission and absorption in cyclotron harmonics is an essentially relativistic phenomenon . as this parameter is quite small for 1e1207 , @xmath16",
    ", observable cyclotron harmonics can hardly be expected , even with allowance for the fact that the strength of a feature formed in an optically thick medium depends on the oscillator strength nonlinearly , and it also depends on other factors , such as the temperature gradient at the depth where the feature is formed .",
    "we should note that the conditions in the relatively cold , low - field atmospheres of 1e1207 and other ccos ( where the free - free absorption and emission dominate over the electron scattering of photons ) are quite different from those in accreting x - ray pulsars , where the parameter @xmath17 is a factor of 30100 larger , which explains the observability of electron cyclotron harmonics in those objects ( e.g. , two harmonics , in addition to the fundamental at 26 kev , have been observed in the binary pulsar v0332 + 53 ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "resonances at cyclotron harmonics ( also known as quantum oscillations ) can , however , arise even in a nonrelativistic plasma due to quantization of rotation of a charged particle in a magnetic field . in particular , the energy of , e.g. , a nonrelativistic electron is @xmath18 where @xmath19 , 1 , 2 , @xmath20 numerates the landau levels , and @xmath21 is the ( continuous ) electron s momentum along the magnetic field . as a result of the quantization ,",
    "various properties of matter show discontinuities when the number of the involved landau levels changes ( e.g. , when a transition to a higher landau level becomes allowed with increasing the energy of the photon that causes this transition ) .",
    "moreover , because the electron motion is continuous only in one dimension , the phase space density of final electron states in such transitions experiences square - root singularities at these discontinuities , which gives rise to logarithmically high resonances at harmonics of the cyclotron energy ( see section 2 for more detail ) .",
    "such quantum resonances in free - free absorption of photons in a magnetic field were first noticed by pavlov & panov ( 1976 ; hereafter pp76 ) who derived the spectral opacities and emissivities of a plasma with @xmath22 for different photon polarizations . as the free - free transitions are an important source of opacity in ns atmospheres , one can expect the resonances to manifest themselves as absorption spectral features in thermal spectra of nss .",
    "this was qualitatively demonstrated by pavlov & shibanov ( 1978 ) who considered emission from an `` atmosphere '' in which the source function in the radiative transfer equation was approximated by a linear function of optical depth .",
    "more realistic , self - consistent ns atmosphere models have been developed later , starting from shibanov et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but they used approximate formulae for the free - free opacity , in which the quantum resonances were neglected .    here",
    "we present first calculations of realistic magnetized ns atmosphere models with the quantum resonances at electron cyclotron harmonics in the free - free opacity taken into consideration and show that harmonically spaced absorption features are significant in the emergent spectra .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that thermal spectra of nss with a surface magnetic field @xmath23@xmath1 g can exhibit several such features in the observable x - ray range , and , in particular , the features observed in the spectrum of 1e1207 can be interpreted as due to the quantum effects .",
    "we consider hydrogen ns atmospheres with magnetic fields @xmath23@xmath1 g , such that the electron cyclotron energy , @xmath21 kev , and its first several harmonics are in the soft x - ray range , observable with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. we assume that the atmosphere is hot enough , @xmath24 k , to neglect the small fraction of neutral atoms .",
    "the opacity in such a fully ionized atmosphere is determined by two processes : free - free absorption ( inverse bremsstrahlung ) and scattering of photons by electrons .",
    "] , modified by the magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the atmosphere is cold enough , @xmath25 k , to neglect the change of photon energy in the scattering process ( comptonization effects ) .",
    "moreover , we calculate the opacities in the so - called `` cold plasma approximation '' ( ginzburg 1970 ) , which implies that relativistic effects , such as the cyclotron emission ( hence also absorption and scattering ) at the harmonics of the electron cyclotron energy , can be neglected , as well as the thermal motion effects , including the doppler broadening of the cyclotron resonance .",
    "the transfer of high energy radiation in a magnetized plasma is described by two coupled transfer equations for the ordinary and extraordinary normal modes ( gnedin & pavlov 1974 ) . the normal mode polarizations and opacities depend not only on the photon energy @xmath26 but also on the angle @xmath27 between the wave vector and the magnetic field ; they can be written as ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",

    "various forms for the magnetic gaunt factors @xmath37 were derived by pp76 , instead of the gaunt factors . ] who calculated the dependence of the gaunt factors on the dimensionless photon energy @xmath38 for several values of the `` quantization parameter '' @xmath39 and obtained simple expressions for limiting cases .",
    "examples of the energy dependence of the gaunt factors are shown in figure 1 , for @xmath40 , 0.05 , and 0 . in our calculations",

    "if the last term in @xmath46 is omitted ( i.e. , terms @xmath47 are neglected ) , the cyclotron resonances in @xmath43 diverge logarithmically ( pp76 ; see the dashed curves in the upper panel of figure 1 ) .",

    "each of the added terms contains a singular factor @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "further averaging over @xmath21 with the one - dimensional electron distribution function turns the square - root singularities into logarithmic singularities , @xmath61 .",
    "such behavior is seen in @xmath43 but not in @xmath45 because in @xmath45 the singularity is canceled by the zero of the square of the transition matrix element for the longitudinal polarization [ @xmath62 ; see equations ( 20 ) and ( 26 ) in pp76 ] .",

    "the last term in @xmath46 ( equation [ 5 ] ) accounts for one of such mechanisms , associated with the proton recoil ( the broadened peaks of finite heights are shown by solid lines in figure 1 ) .",
    "when the magnetic field decreases , the distances between the peaks eventually become smaller than their widths , the oscillations disappear , and the magnetic gaunt factors turn into the gaunt factor at @xmath31 .",
    "we emphasize that the oscillations in @xmath37 are solely due to quantization of the electron motion across the magnetic field , because of which the motion in only one dimension ( along the magnetic field ) remains non - quantized and the square - root singularities appear after the integration over the final longitudinal momentum @xmath53 ( see equation [ 6 ] ) . at @xmath66 ,",

    "the cyclotron absorption feature is very strong in the x - mode spectrum but not in the total spectrum because the x - mode flux is small ( pavlov & shibanov 1978 ) .",

    "we see that the angular distribution of the emergent radiation in the absorption features is different from that in the continuum . for instance , the specific intensities are more peaked towards the surface normal at energies outside the absorption features , while the radiation is generally more isotropic at the center of the features .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 2 and 3 show the temperature structures for the six atmosphere models .",
    "the temperature structure is only slightly affected by the relatively low magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , the magnetic field raises the temperature of upper atmospheric layers at @xmath104 , apparently because of cyclotron heating , while outside of this range the surface temperature becomes lower .",
    "we have presented computations of fully ionized hydrogen atmospheres of nss for magnetic fields @xmath0@xmath1 g , such that the electron cyclotron energy , @xmath21 kev , is within the range of energies where the thermal emission from isolated nss is usually observed .",
    "we have shown that the peaks in the energy dependence of the free - free opacity , caused by the quantization of the electron rotation around the magnetic force lines , lead to absorption features ( quantum oscillations ) at the electron cyclotron energy and its harmonics in the atmosphere spectra .",
    "the quantum oscillations are best observable at moderately large values of the quantization parameter , @xmath105 , when the quantization is significant but the features are not too far in the wien tail of the spectrum .",
    "the equivalent widths of the absorption features reach @xmath5200 ev in the examples considered ; they grow with increasing @xmath6 and are lower for higher harmonics .",
    "at least two absorption features , at energies 0.7 and 1.4 kev , with equivalent widths @xmath5 ev have been observed in the x - ray spectrum of the cco 1e1207 ( sanwal et al .",
    "since the thermal and cyclotron energies are essentially nonrelativistic for this object ( @xmath106 ) , the features can not be explained as due to the commonly known cyclotron processes . on the other hand , as @xmath1075 , the features can be naturally interpreted as caused by the quantum oscillations .",
    "we note that our calculations support the reality of the suspected features at 2.1 and 2.8 kev in the 1e1207 spectrum @xcite . to confirm our interpretation and infer the properties of the 1e1207 s atmosphere ,",
    "the phase - dependent spectra of 1e1207 should be compared with the model spectra obtained by integrating the specific intensities over the visible ns surface at different rotation phases , for various orientations of the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "in addition to 1e1207 , there exist other nss with similar magnetic fields and temperatures whose emission can be described by our atmosphere models .",
    "in particular , other ccos , which likely have magnetic fields @xmath23@xmath1 g ( halpern & gotthelf 2010 , and references therein ) , are expected to show quantum oscillations in their soft x - ray spectra .",
    "however , conditions for their observation may be less favorable .",
    "for example , for the spin - down magnetic field @xmath108 g of the cco j1852 + 0040 in the kesteven 79 snr ( halpern & gotthelf 2010 ) , the spectrum should show absorption features at the cyclotron energy , @xmath109 kev and its harmonics .",
    "however , as the spectrum below @xmath110 kev is strongly absorbed by the ism ( @xmath111 cm@xmath73 ) , only high harmonics , whose equivalent widths are small , might be detectable .",
    "interestingly , the spectrum of this cco , detected by the _ xmm - newton _ epic detectors ( see figure 3 in halpern & gotthelf 2010 ) , shows a hint of an absorption feature at @xmath113 kev , which might be third or fourth harmonic of the cyclotron energy , @xmath114 or 0.26 kev , respectively . to confirm the feature and estimate the cyclotron energy and gravitational redshift , a deeper observation of this cco is required .    for the other pulsating cco , j08224300 in the puppis a snr ,",
    "the period derivative has not yet been measured , and only an upper limit on the magnetic field , @xmath115 g , has been estimated by gotthelf & halpern ( 2009 ) . fitting the spectrum with a double blackbody model , these authors found an emission feature around 0.8 kev at some phases .",
    "to explain the fact that the feature is seen in emission , one has to assume an energy source in the upper layers of the atmosphere , such as the heat released by accreting matter , which is not included in our models .",
    "however , it seems that the spectral structure at these energies ( see figure 3 in gotthelf & halpern 2009 ) can also be interpreted as an absorption feature , perhaps a cyclotron line , centered at @xmath116 kev , which of course would imply a different continuum . to examine this interpretation and look for quantum oscillations ,",
    "the cco s phase - resolved spectra should be fitted with our atmosphere models .",
    "another class of nss with possible quantum oscillations in their spectra are radio pulsars with magnetic fields @xmath117@xmath1 g. there are 62 pulsars with such fields in the atnf pulsar catalogue , but none of them has been observed in x - rays .",
    "as these pulsars are old ( the youngest one , psr j18101820 with @xmath118 g , has the spin - down age @xmath119 myr ) , the bulk of ns surface is too cold to be seen in x - rays , but their polar caps can be heated up to @xmath1103 mk by relativistic particles and @xmath7-rays generated in the pulsar magnetosphere ( see , e.g. , zavlin & pavlov 2004 ) . observing the quantum oscillations in the thermal spectra of polar caps is , however , a challenging task because the luminosity of this component is low and it is strongly absorbed by the ism for many of the pulsars .    in conclusion , we should mention that the opacities by pp76 , used in our atmosphere models , become inaccurate close to the centers of the quantum peaks , especially at the core of the fundamental cyclotron line . a more accurate consideration , which would include corrections to the born approximation and the collective ( high - density ) effects ( e.g. , sawyer 2007 ) , and take into account the doppler broadening of the fundamental resonance ( pavlov et al .",
    "1980a ) , should broaden the spectral features and decrease the number of observable ones .",
    "also , it would be worthwhile to investigate the role of the relativistic corrections to the opacities ( including the resonances at the cyclotron harmonics ) .",
    "finally , for the comparison with the observational data , it would be useful to construct atmosphere models with magnetic fields inclined to the normal to the surface and integrate the emission over ( a fraction of ) the ns surface .",
    "we plan to consider these problems in future works .",
