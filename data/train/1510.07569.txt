    "the oxide perovskites have an impressive range of the functional properties making them quite indispensable materials for technological applications.@xcite on the other hand , the experiments with these oxides posed a lot of fundamental problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "the point is that even though the bulk properties of perovskite ( and those of the other symmetries ) oxides are well known ( see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) , the interfaces between the oxides can exhibit a multitude of very exotic properties .",
    "after the seminal paper of ohtomo and hwang@xcite , the interest to the properties of interfaces between two oxides has been renewed enourmously.@xcite this is because the physical properties of such interfaces turn out to be much richer than those of the bulk constituents .",
    "possibly , the most studied oxide interface system so far is the high - mobility confined metallic electron gas that appears in heterostructures combining two band insulators , namely , in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto).@xcite while the lao and sto compounds are insulating non - magnetic oxides , their interface can exhibit not only two - dimensional metallic conductivity@xcite but also the low - temperature superconductivity , ferromagnetism @xcite , their coexistence @xcite and phase transition to insulating phase from metallic or even superconducting ones @xcite . also , anomalous",
    "magnetoresistance and hall effect have been measured and explained @xcite .",
    "these exotic properties of the interfaces ( lao / sto in particular ) make them presently the subject of very intensive experimental and theoretical studies .    despite continuous experimental and theoretical efforts ,",
    "the physical origin of quasi - two - dimensional mobile electron gas in lao / sto interface still remains unclear .",
    "currently , two main scenarios coexist .",
    "first one is related to the so - called polar catastrophe model and the other one to extrinsic doping effects by the la@xmath1 cations , which are the @xmath2-type dopants in sto.@xcite the former model can be formulated in terms of the usual electrostatics . indeed , due to the alternating polarity of atomic layers in lao along the [ 001 ] direction , the electrostatic potential diverges in lao ( hence the words `` polar catastrophe '' ) unless the electric charges are reconstructed at the interface .",
    "the two choices for the connection between lao and sto impose opposite electrostatic boundary conditions .",
    "namely , laalo@xmath0 is composed of charged layers of ( lao)@xmath3 and ( alo@xmath4)@xmath5 , whereas the corresponding layers in srtio@xmath0 are chargeless .",
    "therefore , terminating the lao on an atomic plane at the interface breaks the charge neutrality yielding the above - mentioned `` polar catastrophe '' at the interface . to avoid diverging interface energy ,",
    "a compensating charge is required . as the lao / sto interfacial `` polar catastrophe ''",
    "is quite common at the semiconductor heterointerfaces ( see , e.g. , refs . )",
    ", we will be using below the spatially inhomogeneous equations , which is appropriate for the interfaces .",
    "we should note that in addition to above two scenarios , there is one more consisting in the formation of bulk - like oxygen vacancies in the sto layers near the interface , which provides the free carriers @xcite .",
    "now this scenario is considered as less probable . nevertheless , there are still very active debates about possible origin of the observed lao / sto interface conductivity .",
    "in this paper we consider a macroscopic model which makes possible to describe the 2d metallic conductivity of the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface .",
    "we consider the semi - classical @xcite formalism used to describe the contacts between two solids like metal - semiconductor , two semiconductors etc .",
    "this formalism , being phenomenological by its nature , utilizes the set of equations for current ( resistive + diffusive ) along with the poisson and continuity equations .",
    "it allows to calculate the band bending , and , in the case when the edge of conduction band goes below the fermi level , gives the local ( in the interface ) metal - insulator transition .",
    "it turns out that in the case of lao / sto interface this formalism allows to derive simple 1d differential equations , which permit to solve this problem exactly , presenting a simple criterion of such 2d interface conductivity appearance .",
    "moreover , we can predict that for the interface to have properly 2d conductivity , the charge carriers in constituting materials ( i.e. , lao and sto in our case ) should be of the same type , both electrons ( @xmath2-@xmath2 junction ) or both holes ( @xmath6-@xmath6 junction ) . in the opposite case of @xmath6-@xmath2 or @xmath2-@xmath6 junctions ,",
    "the resulting metallic state will be three - dimensional .    before proceeding further",
    ", we should make a remark that in the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructure neither lao nor sto are ferroelectric .",
    "the sto can become ferroelectric under an external stress and/or strain .",
    "such stress ( strain ) arises due to the mismatch effects which appear inevitably at any interface , and it can be the case for lao / sto also . on their turn , the mechanical stresses may trigger the initial band bending ( see ref . , where the notched structures in the interface region have been observed experimentally ) leading to electron accumulation and metallic 2d conductivity .",
    "also , the strain effects may engender electron - phonon interaction at the interface , which in turn may generate the interfacial superconductivity .",
    "first of all , we consider the problem qualitatively . if we have a contact of two conducting solids in thermodynamic equilibrium , the position of fermi level @xmath7 is the same for both of them .",
    "so far , we do not consider the formation of the bardeen barrier at the interface ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , which can pin the fermi level .",
    "we can consider the fermi level to be `` frozen '' , while the edges of conduction @xmath8 and/or valence @xmath9 bands are `` movable '' .",
    "if we move the band edge @xmath8 below the fermi level for the @xmath2-type of conductivity ( or @xmath9 above @xmath7 for the @xmath6-type ) , the part of a sample , where the condition @xmath10 is satisfied , becomes metallic .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 positions occurs due to their dependence ( at wavevectors @xmath11 ) on spatial coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "this dependence is formalized by the corresponding coordinate dependence of electrostatic potential @xmath13 so that the energy band bending is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the electronic charge ) .",
    "if there is no effects of ferroelectric domain structure ( we recollect here that sto under normal conditions is nonferroelectric ) , there is no variation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 along @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "so , here we consider only the important dependence on @xmath18 coordinate , which is perpendicular to the interface.@xcite    now , if the lao / sto interface is the contact of semiconductors of the same type of conductivity ( like @xmath2-@xmath2 or @xmath6-@xmath6 ) , the energy band bending looks like that in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( shown for the @xmath2-@xmath2 junction ) . in this case , under different",
    "schottky barrier heights @xmath19 , the electrostatic potential function , describing @xmath20 ( for the case of @xmath2-type conductivity ) at the interface can be lower than @xmath7 , thus giving the metallic conductivity near the interface",
    ". it is seen ( red coloured `` nib '' in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , that the region of the sample , where the metallic conductivity is realized , is confined between two blue curves @xmath21 and @xmath22 and thus is truly of 2d character as it is extended in the @xmath23 plane of the sample .    the case of @xmath6-@xmath2 ( or @xmath2-@xmath6 ) junction is shown in fig .",
    "now the band profile at the interface is smooth ( without any `` nib '' ) , and the situation with @xmath24 @xmath7 is shown by the blue curve .",
    "it is seen that , contrary to the case of @xmath6-@xmath6 or @xmath2-@xmath2 junction in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , the metallic region is extended in @xmath18 - direction , resulting in the 3d character of metallic conductivity .",
    "note , that while the bands on panel ( a ) are shown for nonzero surface charge density @xmath25 , resulting from the presence of charged ( lao)@xmath3 or ( alo@xmath4)@xmath5 layers at the interface , the full lines on panel ( b ) report the hypothetic case @xmath26 .",

    "it is seen , first of all , that the linear case captures the situation qualitatively pretty good ( note that the same is true for @xmath6-@xmath2 junctions ) and for presented materials parameters gives also good quantitative coincidence with nonlinear case .",
    "this means , that in the problem of lao / sto interface we can safely use linear approximation and explicit `` metallicity criterion '' .",
    "we finally note here that varying the parameters of substances 1 and 2 ( like their dielectric permittivities and bulk electronic concentrations ) as well as temperature , we can obtain `` better metallicity '' in the interface .",
    "also , the presented formalism permits to calculate current - voltage characteristics of the interface as well as time - dependent ( nonequilibrium like frequency - dependent conductivity ) quantities .",
    "latter calculations , probably , can be done only numerically .",

    "as we have discussed above , our calculations are in agreement with electrostatic , `` polar catastrophe '' scenario of emergence of metallic interface .",
    "although this scenario has its shortcomings @xcite ( like the discrepancy between the expected surface carrier density @xmath142  @xmath143 and the measured values around 10@xmath144 @xmath143 ) , the experimental investigations of lao / sto interface by means of _ in situ _ photoemission spectroscopy @xcite show that this scenario is pretty realizable by means of formation of the notched structure ( where charge carriers can accumulate ) inside the nonpolar sto layers .",
    "this accumulation is necessary to avoid the `` polar catastrophe '' ( the electric potential divergence ) in the polar lao layers . in other words ,",
    "the divergence can be lifted by the formation of the long - range electric potential inside the sto whose spatial variation is governed by the band bending , formed in turn by the charge carriers in the sto layers .",
    "our theory takes this effect into account .",
    "the other question is the origin of these excessive charge carriers ( the electrons for concreteness ) . in principle , these carriers can be supplied either by the above discussed oxygen vacancies @xcite or extrinsic doping in sto .",
    "however , widely accepted explanation of the source of carriers is also within the `` polar catastrophe '' model , namely by the charge transfer from the lao to the sto of 1/2 electron per unit cell to avoid the electrostatic potential divergence due to the stacking of a polar material onto a non - polar one . in the spirit of that",
    ", our model makes the important physical conclusion that truly 2d metallic interface is possible if both constituents have the same ( @xmath2-@xmath2 to @xmath6-@xmath6 ) types of conductivity .",
    "note , that the important peculiarity of the lao / sto interface is the strong sensitivity of its transport properties to external electric field that permits to tune its physical properties by that field , which in turn , advances considerably its practical applications .",
    "we recollect finally the main conclusions of our theory . to realize the 2d conducting interface between two dielectrics ( lao and sto for instance ) , we need the fulfilment of two conditions - the same ( @xmath2-@xmath2 or @xmath6-@xmath6 ) type of conductivity of two interface forming dielectrics and the filling of `` fermi sea '' by the free electrons or holes .",
    "latter condition states simply that ( conduction for electrons and valence for holes ) band edge @xmath145 should lie below the fermi level of a structure . in nonlinear case",
