    "since its discovery in the interstellar medium , maser emission has been used as probe to study the different aspects of astronomical environments .",
    "the strong maser emission has even provided detailed pictures of the central region of distant galaxies .",
    "there had been great expectation that masers could also provide information on the physical properties of the molecular gas at scales inaccessible by other observational means .",
    "theoretical studies have been carried out to find the pumping mecanisms and the necessary conditions for the existence of masers . however , due to the strongly nonlinear nature of masers , the relation between observed characteristics and the physical conditions of the masing medium is difficult to determine .",
    "+ at the fundamental level , the physics of astronomical maser is very similar to that of laboratory lasers , which are masers operating at the optical wavelengths .",
    "most of the properties of laboratory lasers are well described by the semi - classical model of lamb ( 1964 ) .",
    "the feature that distinguishes laser radiation from classical light sources is the remarkable degree of spatial and temporal coherence largely due to the nature of stimulated emission and the use of high - q cavity and other means of stabilization .",
    "the statistics of laser radiation has been shown to follow poisson - like distribution ( arechi 1965 ) .",
    "the similarity between the laboratory laser and the astronomical maser has prompted speculations that maser radiation might not be gaussian .",
    "however , previous observational attempts ( evans et al . 1972 , moran 1981 ) to measure the non - gaussian statistics of maser radiation have proved negative .",
    "+ it was recognized very early in the study of astronomical masers ( litvak 1970 ) that the maser radiation field is broadband .",
    "the coherence time set by the bandwidth of the maser radiation is therefore much shorter than the typical time scale of molecular response . in deriving the transfer equations for maser radiation ,",
    "two important assumptions are used by litvak ( 1970 ) and later by goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) in their study of the maser polarization .",
    "the first assumption specifies that the field is stationary and different spectral components are not correlated .",
    "the second assumption concerns the gaussian distribution of the electric field components .",
    "goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) reason that due to the large dimension of astronomical masers , the phase shift between waves propagating in slightly different directions is so enormous that the waves become completely independent and random .",
    "the electric field seen by masing molecules is the superposition of independent and random electromagnetic waves and therefore will have gaussian statistics according to the well - known central limit theorem .",
    "these two main assumptions allow considerable simplification in deriving the transfer equations .",
    "although several theoretical studies of maser radiation are based on these assumptions , their validity has not been fully examined , especially in the saturation regime where analytical and numerical studies have been regularly carried out .",
    "we note here that the work by field & richardson ( 1984 ) and field & gray ( 1988 ) did try to take into account the partial coherence of the maser radiation in an approximate way .",
    "their analysis suggests some difference in the predicted maser intensity in comparison with the commonly used maser theory .",
    "furthermore , the recent debate on the theoretical descriptions of the polarization properties of astronomical masers ( watson 1994 , elitzur 1995 ) also underlines the urgent need to re - examine the foundations of the current maser theory .",
    "+ to simulate from first principles the amplification of radiation by a masing medium is quite complicated .",
    "the radiation field has to be considered as an ensemble of all possible statistically independent realizations .",
    "studying the amplification of maser radiation then requires a dramatic increase in computing power to follow the evolution of a large number of realizations of the incident radiation .",
    "however , from these samples we can study the effect of amplication on the statistical distribution of the radiation field and check the validity of the above - mentioned assumptions . the physical model to describe the amplification of broadband radiation by a one - dimensional maser has been formulated by menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) . using simple analysis",
    "they show that the gaussian statistics can not be maintained as the radiation is amplified and begins to affect the population inversion of the maser .",
    "menegozzi & lamb carried out the simulations in several cases including the medium with dopller broadenning , which is relevent to astronomical masers . due to limited computing power",
    ", they could simulate only a handful of realizations of the radiation field , and therefore , the results are still inconclusive .",
    "it is surprising that no further study has followed the work of menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) , particularly in view of the great computing power available today .",
    "+ a recent work by gray & bewley ( 2003 ) also deals with the broadband nature of the maser radiation field .",
    "the conclusion reached in their work indicates that different frequency components across the maser line profile are phase - locked even in the partial saturation regime .",
    "the phase - locking ( or mode - locking ) effect also means that maser radiation is pulsating .",
    "the result is unexpected because the phase - locking of different frequency modes was not seen in the work of menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) .",
    "furthermore , in laboratory laser systems the mode - locking can only be achieved through external control either with opto - electronic components ( q - switch ) or with passive elements such as saturable absorbers .",
    "we could not easily find a clear explanation on the physical mechanism giving rise to this behaviour .",
    "we will discuss the model of gray & bewley and compare their result with that obtained from our simulations in the following sections .",
    "+ in this paper we will use the formulation worked out by menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) to study in detail the astronomical maser and simulate from first principles the amplification of broadband background radiation field by the maser .",
    "the characteristics of the maser radiation will be determined directly without recourse to any approximations .",
    "the generalization of our model to include the vector nature of the radiation field to study the polarization properties of masers is straightforward and will be described in a subsequent paper .",
    "we hope that our work will provide a better understanding of the underlying physical principles and the limitations of the current theory of astronomical masers .",
    "the continuum radiation which propagates along the @xmath0 axis and arrives on the boundary of the masing medium is the superposition of waves coming from many small , independent sources and therefore , is a random function of time .",
    "we assume that the incident radiation field @xmath1 is stationary , which means that the statistical properties of the field does not change with time .",
    "we further assume that the underlying probability distribution of random variable @xmath1 at any instant of time is described by a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath2=@xmath3 , where the brackets denote the ensemble average , or the average taken over a large number of realizations of the field . in practice",
    "we can measure the power of the field by averaging the output of a square - law detector : @xmath4 because @xmath1 is a random process , @xmath5 defined as above for each realization of the field during the interval @xmath6 $ ] is also a random variable . as @xmath7 tends to infinity , @xmath5 will approach the average power of the radiation field : @xmath8 to relate the statistical properties to time average quantities we need to restrict the random process @xmath1 to be ergodic , i.e ensemble average is equal to time average of any member of the ensemble .",
    "justifications for this assumption constitute the famous ergodic theorem ( doob 1953 ) .",
    "the ergodic property is also the underlying assumption of almost all observations in radio astronomy .",
    "therefore we can write : @xmath9 where the brackets denote the ensemble average .",
    "in the following sections of the paper we shall use the concept of spectral components of the random process @xmath1 . for that purpose",
    "we might formally use fourier transform to decompose @xmath1 into harmonic elements @xmath10 : @xmath11 it becomes apparent immediately that because the random function @xmath1 does not decay to zero at infinity and the above integrals do not exist .",
    "in other words , the function @xmath1 is not absolutely integrable .",
    "we can circumvent this difficulty by truncating the function @xmath1 on a finite interval @xmath6 $ ] and define a new function @xmath12 which is equal to @xmath1 over -t/2@xmath13t/2 and periodic outside this interval .",
    "we can now expand @xmath12 into harmonic components using fourier series : @xmath14 where the angular frequency @xmath15=@xmath16 and @xmath17 because @xmath1 is a random function , the coefficients @xmath18 are new complex random variables . in general",
    ", the coefficients @xmath18 are independent of each other only in the limit of large t , i.e @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( root & pitcher 1955 ) . for random process with continuum spectrum or `` white noise '' , the values of @xmath1 at different instants of time are completely uncorrelated , or the auto - correlation is a delta function",
    ". therefore the coefficients @xmath18 are gaussian random variables and independent even for finite values of the interval @xmath7 ( goldman 1953 , rice 1944 , root & pitcher 1955 ) .",
    "using perceval s theorem we obtain the following relation : @xmath21 physically , the term @xmath22 can be interpreted as the power of @xmath1 contained within the frequency interval @xmath23=@xmath24=@xmath25 during the interval @xmath6 $ ] . by taking the ensemble average , which means averaging over a large number of realizations of the radiation field",
    ", we can define : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the speed of light . in the limit @xmath28 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath29 approaches the power spectrum of the random process @xmath1 : @xmath30 the summation in the fourier series can be formally replaced by the fourier - stieltjes integral in the limit that @xmath7 tends to infinity by substituting @xmath31 by @xmath32 , the increment of an orthogonal random process @xmath33 . @xmath34 where the limit should be understood in the mean square sense , namely : @xmath35 if the random function @xmath33 is differentiable , i.e @xmath36 exists , the expression above will reduce to the normal fourier transform . as we can see from * eq .",
    "*  [ eq8 ] , the magnitude of @xmath37 is @xmath38 , many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the derivative of @xmath33 does not exist .",
    "more rigorous derivation of the spectral resprentation theorem for random processes can be found in standard texts such as doob ( 1953 ) , yaglom ( 1962 ) and priestley ( 1981 ) .",
    "+ in the case of an emission line , the radiation is bandwidth limited around the frequency of the transition .",
    "if we take @xmath40=2@xmath41 , for the sake of simplicity , to be the central frequency of the maser line , the electric field of the radiation propagating along the @xmath0 axis can be expressed as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath27 is the speed of light and the complex amplitudes @xmath43 are slow - varying functions of both time and space .",
    "the complex function @xmath44 is called the analytic signal representation of the electric field since the function is analytic in the upper half of the complex @xmath45 plane . in practice",
    "we can not simulate or measure the random process @xmath43 over an infinitely long interval of time , we shall restrict ourselves to study realizations of the radiation field during an interval @xmath7 long enough that provides adequate spectral resolution @xmath23=@xmath25 . using the spectral representation theorem , we can expand the time dependent electric field in terms of fourier series : @xmath46 where the fourier components are given by @xmath47 with @xmath15= 2@xmath48n / t . for bandwidth limited signal the fourier components @xmath49 will be zero for sufficiently large values of @xmath50 . + the complex components @xmath51 are random variables , whose real and imaginary parts ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) are jointly independent gaussian with zero mean and the same variance @xmath54/2 .",

    "in fact , the value of @xmath72 , which is called the periodogram by its originator schuster , fluctuates wildly around the true power spectrum @xmath68 .",
    "the periodogram is usually refered as the non - consistent estimator of the power spectrum in the signal processing literature .",
    "one way to achieve convergence is to perform a local averaging of the periodogram ( champeney 1989 ) : @xmath73 this theorem shows that in order to obtain good estimate of the power spectrum , a trade - off in spectral resolution must be made , which is of course the principle of many smoothing schemes to estimate the power spectrum of random processes .",
    "+ if we want to properly define the power spectrum using time average of a single fluctuating function @xmath1 , we need to resort to the techniques of generalized harmonic analysis ( wiener 1930 ) . simply speaking , to obtain the power spectrum we need to measure the auto - correlation function : @xmath74 the wiener - khintchin theorem",

    "as shown in menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) , for gaussian variables we can factorize the terms involving power of intensity @xmath176 such as @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "therefore the change in statistics of the total radiation field seen by the molecules inside the maser is : @xmath179 the above equation shows that the parameter @xmath165 will decrease as the radiation is amplified by the maser .",
    "that means large fluctuations of the field are suppressed in comparision to smaller fluctuations .",
    "the result has a simple physical interpretation : large fluctuations can quickly deplete the population inversion , resulting in slower growth rate .",
    "smaller fluctuations can grow at a different and faster rate , thus effectively reduce the range of intensity fluctuations .",
    "+ we can also assess heuristically the effect of the interaction between masing molecules and the radiation field by comparing the intensity predicted by the standard radiation transfer equation * eq . *  [ eq50 ] and our model in the first order approximation described by * eqs . *  [ eq60 ]  &  [ eq62 ] .",
    "the amplification of the ensemble averaged intensity of the radiation field in this approximation is : @xmath180 the appearance of factor @xmath181 in the second term indicates that the fluctuations of radiation field can reduce the population inversion faster then that predicted by the standard equation * eq . *  [ eq50 ]",
    ". consequently , our simulations will give a slightly lower ensemble average intensity under the same conditions for the maser in comparision to the standard maser theory .",
    "we note that previous work by field & richardson ( 1984 ) and field & gray ( 1988 ) , taking into account in an approximate manner the partial coherence of the maser radiation , also reached qualitatively similar conclusion , namely lower maser intensity appears in modest saturation regime in comparison to the standard maser theory .",
    "in our simulation we will choose the parameters appropriate to astronomical maser .",
    "for simplicity , we choose the loss rate @xmath182 = 1 s@xmath157 and the normalized pump rates are assumed have a velocity dispersion @xmath183 with the difference in pump rates @xmath184 .",
    "in our simulation we use 200 modes with a frequency resolution of @xmath185 or 0.75 s@xmath157 around the maser line and we assume that this frequency range covers the range @xmath186 to @xmath187 in the velocity domain .",
    "the actual velocity resolution @xmath188 will depend on the frequency of the maser line , as @xmath188 = @xmath189 .",
    "for the maser line such as the 1612 mhz oh maser , @xmath188 is approximately 2 cm s@xmath157 .",
    "the corresponding value for the velocity dispersion is 200 cm s@xmath157 although the velocity dispersion of the maser line in our simulations is much smaller than in real astronomical masers , the number of frequency modes and the bandwidth are large enough , i.e. the bandwidth of 150 s@xmath157 is much greater than the loss rate of 1 s@xmath157 , to capture the main features of the broadband radiation field produced by the astronomical masers .",
    "since we deals with only partially saturated maser , we consider only 15 harmonic components of the population inversion @xmath190 . as shown later",
    ", the number of harmonic components is enough to capture the pulsation of the molecular population inversion .",
    "we generate the background continuum radiation in a simimlar way as menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) using random generator ran2 from press et al .",
    "the phase of electric field components is random and uniformly distributed over the interval 0 to 2@xmath48 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that the amplitude of different modes has a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath1911 on scale of @xmath192 . on this scale",
    "the intensity has the unit of the photon occupation number .",
    "the intensity of the maser shown in all figures is also of the form @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the intensity per unit frequency @xmath135 as defined in previous section .",
    "we use fourth - order runge - kutta method with a fixed step @xmath1950.01 to integrate the * eq . *  [ eq44 ] .",
    "each realization is evolved through the maser using the rate equations * eqs . *  [ eq40 ] together with the radiation transfer equation * eq . *  [ eq44 ] and we record the emergent radiation for later analysis . +",
    "we carry out our simulations in the partially saturated regime , which is likely relevant to most astronomical masers .",
    "the choice is also necessary because we consider only a limited number of harmonic components of the molecular population inversion . in the saturated regime",
    "the fluctuation will be stronger and thus require the consideration of a larger number of harmonic components .",
    "the amplification of the maser is specified by the unsaturated optical depth @xmath196 at the line center .",
    "a value of @xmath196 = 22 is used throughout in our simulations . the spontaneous transition rate between the upper and lower maser levels is taken to be 10@xmath197 s@xmath157 .",
    "the einstein coefficient @xmath145 is related to the spontaneous transition rate by the well - known relation @xmath198 .",
    "the new ingredient of our model is the explicit treatment of the radom radiation field and the inclusion of the molecular population pulsation and the coupling between different modes of the radiation field .",
    "we can examine each of these effects on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the maser .",
    "if we neglect the population pulsation , as can be seen from * eq .",
    "*  [ eq44 ] only the intensity of the waves enters into the radiation transfer equation .",
    "thus different realizations with initial constant amplitude but random phases are indistinguishable and we expect them to evolve similarly .",
    "however , when population pulsation is taken into account , different modes can interact and the random phases can induce fluctuations in the amplitude of the waves . in * fig . *",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the evolution of a particular realization of the field whose modes have constant amplitude but random phases .",
    "initially the mode - coupling is negligible and the intensity across the maser line half way into the maser medium , which corresponds to the optical depth of @xmath199/2 , varies smoothly according to the change of the optical depth with frequency .",
    "the usual line - narrowing effect can be clearly seen because the initial fwhm of the maser line due to inhomogeneous ( doppler ) broadening is 2@xmath183ln2@xmath200140 frequency channels and the fwhm of the laser line at the mid - point of the laser ( see the middle frame of * fig .",
    "*  [ fig1 ] ) is only around 50 frequency channels . as the intensity grows different modes of the radiation field inside the homogeneous lorentzian profile can couple and drive the molecular population pulsations .",
    "the emergent maser radiation fluctuates widely around the line center where this effect is strongest ( * fig . *",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the maser in this case is only partially saturated with the saturation parameter r/@xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the simulated emission rate . in * fig . *  [ fig2 ] we show the amplitude of the fourier components for the population pulsations at the line center .",
    "the dominant component is at zero frequency or the average of population inversion .",
    "the amplitude of other fourier components remains small and decreases at higher pulsation frequency .",
    "nevertherless the population pulsation and mode - coupling are effective in inducing the fluctuations of the amplified maser radiation .",
    "we can also see from * fig . *  [ fig1 ] that the phases of different modes remain random as the waves propagate through the maser and experience amplification .",
    "no mode - locking or phase correlation is seen in our simulations .",
    "we also checked the simulation results shown in menegozzi & lamb ( 1978 ) and could not find any evidence for phase correlation between different modes of the radiation field .",
    "thus , our results do not corroborate the suggestion of gray & bewley ( 2003 ) that there is a strong phase correlation between frequency modes or mode - locking even for partially saturated maser .",
    "the likely reason for the difference is that the formulation of gray & bewley ( 2003 ) , which follows closely that of yariv ( 1989 ) for the amplification of monochromatic ( single mode ) laser emission , instead of the broadband random radiation field . the steady state constraint imposed on * eq .",
    "*  28 of their paper leads to the presence in subsequent equations of time - dependent terms , which are supposed to be eliminated by the same procedure .",
    "of course , the problem can be avoided if their equation * eq . *  28 is expanded into fourier series as we have done here .",
    "+ in * fig . *  [ fig3 ] we show the input radiation field with both random amplitude and phase of different modes are random",
    ". we also show in * fig . *  [ fig3 ] the radiation field at the mid - point of the maser and the emergent radiation field . as can be seen in the figure , only modes around the line center",
    "are amplified strongly . because of the nonlinear amplification , the relative intensity fluctuations between different mode changes as the radiation is amplified in the maser medium",
    "that is the case for the relatively strong mode seen close to the line center in the initial input field ( see * fig . *",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . when the intensity of the radiation field is still small , i.e. the maser is unsaturated , all the modes are amplified by the same factor as evident in the middle frame of * fig . *  [ fig3 ] .",
    "however , as the maser approaches saturation , the adjacent modes , which are initially weaker , grow faster . as a result",
    ", the relative intensity fluctuation is reduced in the output radiation field .",
    "we also note that the phases between modes are still completely random as seen in * fig . *  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we have followed the amplification of an ensemble of 18000 realizations of the incident radiation field through the maser . by taking the ensemble average of the output field",
    "we could build up the observable intensity profile of the maser line and the statistics of the radiation field .",
    "the parameter @xmath165 , which measures the deviation from gaussian statistics , is shown in * fig . *  [ fig4 ] .",
    "for the first time we are able to determine the statistics of the maser radiation directly from numerical simulations . even in our case of partial saturation with r/@xmath203 at the line center ,",
    "the statistical distribution of the total radiation field deviates quite significantly from gaussian .",
    "the decrease of @xmath165 at the line center suggests that intensity fluctuations diminish with saturation and the statistical distribution of the radiation field becomes more centrally peaked . as discussed previously ,",
    "the non - gaussian statistics is the direct consequence of the non - linear interaction between masing molecules and the radiation field .",
    "we could expect that the deviation will be even more pronounced as the maser becomes fully saturated .",
    "+ we also compare the ensemble averaged intensity of the total electric field taken over 18000 realizations of the field ( see * fig .",
    "*  [ fig4 ] ) with the prediction of the standard radiation transfer equations * eq . *  [ eq50 ] .",
    "the two calculations match closely with each other in the line wings . at the center of the maser line",
    "our simulation produces a slightly lower ensemble average intensity than that given by the standard theory , consistent with our heuristic analysis in previous section .",
    "therefore in the unsaturated and partially saturated regime the standard theory of astronomical maser can produce results in good agreement with that from our more realistic treatment .",
    "however , in saturated masers where population pulsation and mode - coupling are expected to be much stronger than considered here and the radiation field deviates even more from gaussian statistics , the usual approach used by litvak ( 1970 ) and goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) are no longer applicable . as a result , previous calculations using the standard radiation transfer equations and carried out in the full saturation regime with r/@xmath204 ( western & watson 1984 , deguchi & watson 1990 , nedoluha & watson 1990 ) might not give accurate description of the maser radiation and should be considered with cautions .",
    "we also note that fully saturated maser is of purely theoretical interest because real astronomical masers are unlikely to be found in this regime due to various constraints including the pumping of masers .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the degree of saturation for astronomical masers , the modelling results of watson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that recent observations of water maser features with gaussian spectral line profile ( sarma et al .",
    "2001 ) can only be explained if the maser is unsaturated with r/@xmath205 .",
    "+ the deviation from gaussian statistics seen in our simulations can be measured in practice if we can observe an isolated maser source with frequency resolution comparable to the homogeneous line width @xmath206 . when the frequency resolution is much larger than the homogenous bandwidth ,",
    "the measured electric field is the sum over many independently random harmonic components and the resulting statistics is expected to become gaussian .",
    "large bandwidth is used in previous attempts ( evans et al .",
    "1972 , moran 1981 ) to measure the statistics of the maser radiation and that might contribute to the negative results , although other complications such as the presence of several independent maser soures inside the radio telescope beam might preclude any such detection .",
    "+ finally we should emphasize that our formulation of the maser theory , which is based on the work of menegozzi & lamb ( 178 ) , as well as the standard theory of maser of litvak ( 1970 ) and goldreich et al .",
    "( 1973 ) are all based on the one - dimensional idealization of the maser medium .",
    "thus the maser radiation field consists of plane waves propagating along the same direction . in real astronomical masers ,",
    "the masing medium is a three - dimensional object .",
    "the radiation field at any point in the medium is the superposition of waves propagating in many different directions .",
    "the formaluation of the maser theory in three dimensions , although similar in principle , will be more complicated . the abovementioned results and conclusions from our simulations will need to be reconfirmed in the future with fully three dimensional calculations .",
    "in addition , the spontaneous emission by the masing molecules has been omitted in our model .",
    "this simplification is quite common in the theoretical studies of astronomical masers .",
    "an explicit treatment of the spontaneous emission will require the reformulation of the maser theory using quantum electrodynamics , probably along the line presented in the classic work of sargent et al .",
    "( 1974 ) and clearly is out of the scope of our paper .",
    "however , we note that , in a number of cases the astronomical masers are known observationally to amplified the background continuum source ( such as the central red giant star or the agn ) . thus it s reasonable to expect that the omission of the spontaneous emission will not change qualitatively the results of our model .",
    "the explicit incorporation of the broadband random radiation field and the molecular population pulsation into our treatment of astronomical maser has proved very important to investigate the properties of maser emission .",
    "we have shown clearly the effect of mode coupling in driving the molecular population pulsation .",
    "the amplification of background radiation by maser is accompanied by the change of statistics of the radiation field in which the large fluctuations are suppressed relative to smaller fluctuations .",
    "our simulation results suggest that the standard radiation transfer equation provides a good description of the maser properties such as intensity and line - narrowing in the unsaturated and partially saturated regime .",
    "howerver , the application of the same equation to study masers in the strong saturation regime should be considered with caution .",
    "further studies on the effect of mode coupling and population pulsation in saturated masers are needed and we hope to address them in a future publication .",
