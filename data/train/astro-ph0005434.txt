    "not long after the first observations of uv wind lines by morton ( 1967 ) , repeated observations with the _ copernicus _ satellite discovered that these lines were time variable ( york et al .",
    "1977 , snow 1977 ) .",
    "subsequent _ iue _ observations established that discrete absorption components ( dacs ) are ubiquitous in hot stars with well - developed , but unsaturated wind lines ( e.g. , howarth & prinja 1989 ) and that the presence of dacs is indicative of wind variaility . later work by kaper et al .  ( 1996 ) demonstrated the universality uv wind line variability directly , through time series observations of selected o stars .",
    "massa et al .  ( 1995 ) and kaper et al .  determined that the wind lines in many stars vary on their stellar roation time scale , verifying prinja s ( 1988 ) suggestion that wind line activity is linked to the stellar rotation period .",
    "this has lead researchers to consider physical explanations which rely on phenomena present on the stellar surface , such as magnetic fields ( henrichs et al .",
    "1998 ) or non - radial pulsations ( gies et al .  1999 ) .",
    "whatever the origin , owocki et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that winds with large scale spiral patterns are consistent with some of the observations ( fullerton et al .",
    "1997 , kaper et al .",
    "1999 ) , although other aspects of the variability remain unexplained .",
    "all of the previous results were deduced from observations of galactic stars .",
    "although there is no reason to doubt similar variability in normal extragalactic stars ( prinja & crowther 1998 have detected dacs in several magellanic cloud stars ) , direct observations of wind variability have not been obtained . beside demonstrating its universality , observing wind variability in large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc , smc ) stars with _ fuse _ is important in other respects .",
    "first , the lower metallicity of the clouds provides an opportunity to study how instabilities in line driven winds are affected by abundances .",
    "second , the ions available to _ fuse _ complement those normally observed at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is especially true for the s iv and s vi lines which can be used to determine the ionization structure of wind variability .",
    "third , because sulfur is less abundant than ions with comparable ionization potentials accessible at longer wavelengths , its resonance lines are less optically thick and can be used to probe activity at deeper levels in the winds .",

    "as part of in - orbit checkout ( ioc ) , extended observational sequences were performed on three o stars in the magellanic clouds ( table 1 ) .",
    "the observations were obtained during several visits over intervals spanning 1 to 4 months .",
    "they include a few continuous time streams of several hours and several cases with multiple exposures obtained over the course of a single day .",
    "all of the observations were obtained in time tagged mode through the low resolution apertures ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) . because the observations were obtained early in the mission , the sic channels were not aligned .",
    "consequently , we only have repeated observations for the lif channels and currently lack repeated observations for the important s vi @xmath8 doublet .    because much of the ioc data were obtained to determine the locations of the apertures for the lif and sic channels , the position of the target was moved in the aperture during an observation . in fact , the target was often completely out of the lif aperture for part of the observation . due to these intentional , large image motions ,",
    "normal pipeline reduction was not feasible . instead",
    ", the data were reduced by a suite of idl procedures which proceeded in two stages . in the first stage",
    ", the photon lists were divided into five minute sub - exposures .",
    "a spectrum was extracted for each sub - exposure by summing all counts at a constant @xmath9 ( where @xmath9 is in the dispersion direction ) within a pre - specified @xmath10 range , to obtain the total counts at each @xmath9 .",
    "background corrections are insignificant for our bright program stars and were neglected . during this stage ,",
    "the total counts in a pre - specified wavelength band were determined for each sub - exposure and a `` postage - stamp '' 64@xmath1164 binned image of the detector was produced . in the second processing stage ,",
    "the individual sub - exposures were examined for event bursts ( see sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) and uniformity of flux levels .",
    "sub - exposures that were affected by bursts or which had discrepant flux levels were discarded .",
    "finally , the remaining sub - exposures were aligned by using their mean as a template and then shifting and fitting ( in a least squares sense ) the individual sub - exposures to the mean .",
    "the minimum @xmath12 shifts were applied to each sub - exposure to create the set of aligned spectra .",
    "since we only have repeated observations for the lif channels , we concentrate on the lif1a data ( @xmath13 ) which contain the s iv and o vi wind lines . the data are displayed in figures 13 as _ dynamic spectra_. these are 2-dimensional images of time ordered spectra .",
    "the ordinates are sequential spectrum number and the abscissae are velocity relative to the blue component of the doublet ( adjusted for the stellar radial velocity ) . each horizontal strip is a 5 minute sub - exposure normalized by the _ sample mean spectrum _",
    "( shown at the bottom ) .",
    "sequential stacking avoids the large time gaps which appear when irregularly sampled data are displayed on a linear time scale .",
    "each figure also contains a _ temporal plot _ which gives the relative observation time for each sub - exposure .",
    "a nearly vertical line implies that several spectra were obtained over a very short time period .    * sk 80 = av 232 * ( figure 1 )",
    ": this smc star has distinctively sub - solar metallicity ( see fullerton et al .",
    "we obtained 4 sets of observations between 1999 september 25 and 1999 november 17 .",
    "notice that although the s iv @xmath14 line and @xmath15 doublet are stable throughout the individual observations ( which span up to 12 hours ) they vary strongly from one set of observations to the next .",
    "there is also some indication of an overall brightening of the object at @xmath16 days as well as marginal evidence for a change in the o vi @xmath17 doublet ( which is intrinsically very weak ) .",
    "however , given the nature of the observational sequence , absolute flux levels are uncertain .",
    "the form of the variability affects the entire profile , but the current data set is not suitable for addressing the temporal evolution of wind variability because adjacent observations are separated by several wind flushing times .",
    "the presence several interstellar molecular hydrogen lines throughout the region and strong ly @xmath18 absorption affecting the blue component of o vi ( see fullerton et al .",
    "2000 ) , make it difficult to verify whether an isolated absorption observed in one component of a doublet is part of a dac .",
    "* sk @xmath0111 * ( figure 2 ) : this is an lmc analog of sk 80 which has a higher metallicity ( fullerton et al .",
    "we obtained spectra on 1999 september 26 and 1999 october 31 , with the september set spanning 10 hours . in this case , the overall s iv variability is weaker than in sk 80 , but there is better evidence for o vi variability .",
    "however , it is especially interesting that the s iv lines clearly vary during the 10 hour sept .",
    "observation . throughout this time , a broad absorption band centered near @xmath19 km s@xmath4 in s iv weakened , narrowed and propagated toward higher velocity .",
    "a similar feature is discernible in the red component of o vi , but the blue component is lost in ly @xmath18 absorption .    * sk @xmath005 = hd 268605 * ( figure 3 ) : this lmc star is more than 2 full spectral sub - classes later than the others ( table 1 ) .",
    "our data span nearly 4 months , from 1999 august 23 to 1999 december 13 . in this case",
    ", the o vi variability is quite strong , and in phase with much weaker s iv variability .",
    "there is no evidence for short term variability .",
    "although we lack well - sampled temporal coverage and repeated observations for s vi at this time , the current data still provide a glimpse of the capabilities of _ fuse _ to perform wind variability studies .",
    "the combination of _ fuse _ wavelength coverage and the reduced metallicity of the magellanic cloud stars enabled us to examine wind variability in new density regimes and new ionization states . in many respects ,",
    "s iv and si iv @xmath20 1400 are sensitive to similar plasmas .",
    "however , the reduced abundance of sulfur allows us to probe more massive flows .",
    "both o vi and n v sample very hot plasma .",
    "however , the wider separation of the o vi @xmath21 doublet removes the complications introduced by the overlap of the n v @xmath22 components in many stars ( however , interstellar ly @xmath18 contaminates o vi @xmath23 ) .",
    "these features allowed us to detect wind variability at intermediate velocities in o7 supergiants . in galactic o7 supergiants , all of the wind lines in the _ iue _ or _ hst _ range are saturated , and it is not until o6 and earlier supergiants that si iv desaturates enough for variability to be detected ( see @xmath24 cep in kaper et al . , 1996 ) . even then , n v remains completely saturated , so ionization information can not be obtained .",
    "in contrast , the p  cygni profiles of s iv are well developed and unsaturated in the _ fuse _ spectra of both o7 supergiants .",
    "o vi is similarly well - suited studying variations in spectra of sk @xmath0111 , but is too weak to be useful in sk 80 .",
    "several aspects of the current data are noteworthy .",
    "first , to provide an indication of the magnitude of the physical changes implied by the morphological variability , consider the results from bianchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for s iv in sk 80 and sk @xmath0111 . analyzing the same observations displayed here",
    ", they determined that the line of sight wind column density varied by 68% in sk 80 and 45% in sk @xmath0111 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the variability is not a small perturbation on top of an otherwise steady flow . instead ,",
    "_ variability is a fundamental property of the winds_. second , the _ wind lines vary in every magellanic cloud o star with repeated observations _ separated by more than a few days , a result which is similar to that observed in galactic o stars ( kaper et al .",
    "third , although the s iv variability in sk 80 is stronger than in sk @xmath0111 , its o vi variability is weaker , if present at all  an effect that may be due to the relative abundances of the two stars .",
    "fourth , although sk @xmath005 is cooler than either sk 80 or sk @xmath0111 , its o vi variability is much stronger .",
    "this implies that the variability we happened to observe is of a higher ionization state than in the two o7 stars .",
    "fifth , while there is no evidence of short term ( @xmath25 day ) variability in two of the program stars , it is clearly present in sk @xmath0111 on time scales similar to those observed for the galactic o6 supergiant @xmath24 cep ( kaper et al . , 1996 ) .    from our very limited data",
    ", it appears that the overall wind variability of the magellanic cloud o stars is similar to galactic stars",
    ". however , longer and better sampled time series will be needed to determine whether the time scale of the variability is related to the rotation period of the stars , as it is in many galactic o stars and b supergiants .    this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university . financial support to u.s .",
