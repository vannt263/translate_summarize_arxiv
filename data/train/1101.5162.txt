    "in recent years an increasing number of eclipsing binary systems have been discovered to harbor pulsating components .",
    "the latest comprehensive catalog @xcite contains @xmath2 such objects , discovered almost exclusively from the ground .",
    "the majority ( @xmath3 in total ) show delta scuti type pulsations , followed by @xmath4 sdb and @xmath5 @xmath6  cephei type pulsators as the second and third most frequent types .",
    "even more are expected to be discovered from the current space - based missions _",
    "most _ , _ corot _ , and _",
    "kepler_. there are clear indications that at least some of the modes are non - radial ( as expected for such pulsators ) . for example , in systems like rz  cas @xcite or y  cam @xcite , the pulsations show amplitude and phase modulations during the eclipse phases , as a consequence of the symmetry violation in the surface flux integral due to the occultation .",
    "this opens a new avenue of opportunities for asteroseismic investigations .",
    "as has been shown by numerous examples , there is a major difficulty in single stars that renders the mode identification a state of the art procedure : the inability to resolve their surface .",
    "the observables ( fluxes , spectral line features ) are weighted integrals of the local quantities over the visible stellar disc , and therefore show only weak dependence on the pulsation modes .",
    "all photometric and spectroscopic mode identification methods ( for the most widely used ones , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) must employ detailed models of the internal structure , atmosphere and pulsation , in order to overcome the problem of the low sensitivity .",
    "accurate observational data and model parameters make a nearly unambiguous mode identification possible , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 determined to an accuracy of @xmath9 or better .",
    "unfortunately , single stars rarely have well - determined parameters . the more general approach of doppler imaging @xcite , a remarkable technique for single stars , needs less sophisticated models because it aims at an image - like reconstruction of the surface patterns , and is therefore less sensitive to errors in the stellar parameters @xcite",
    "; however , it is only applicable for rapid rotators , and the solutions still suffer from ambiguities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , a pulsating star in an eclipsing binary offers at least two advantages over the single star scenario . first , binarity enables a precise determination of the fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "second , the eclipses  the mutual occultations of the stars ",
    "implicitly provide a surface sampling : the shadow of one component literally sweeps across the surface of the other .",
    "this purely geometric phenomenon convolves the brightness distribution of the stellar surfaces into the variation of the integrated flux  that is , the light curve .",
    "various inversion techniques may be used to recover the surface brightness structure from the light curve .",
    "they mainly differ in the amount of _ a priori _ assumptions about the surface pattern .",
    "the most common assumption , that the pulsations can be described by spherical harmonics , was employed by @xcite , using the concept of spatial filtering @xcite to identify non - radial modes in the interacting algol - type binary rz  cas .",
    "although the modes could not be unambiguously identified  partly due to the complicating nature of the mass transfer between the components and partly because their approach was not suited very well to multiperiodic oscillations  their study was the first to demonstrate the potential of the approach .",
    "recently , @xcite , based partially on the above method , made a preliminary mode identification for the 8 modes discovered in y  cam , with a similar ambiguity in the mode numbers .",
    "more generally , eclipse mapping methods can be used to invert photometric time series into an instant image of the surface intensity distribution . when applied to high precision photometric data with appropriate temporal resolution",
    ", they can discern far more detailed surface structure than the conventional methods .",
    "eclipse mapping techniques have already been used to reconstruct static intensity patterns in a variety of eclipsing binaries ( accretion discs in cataclysmic binaries , close binaries with spotted members , and even contact binaries ) .",
    "an immediate opportunity is then to map the non - radial oscillation patterns in eclipsing binaries , which would allow a direct approach to the mode identification . as with doppler imaging , eclipse mapping needs only simple models with a few parameters , which , moreover , can be more easily determined in eclipsing binaries .",
    "therefore , asteroseismology could in principle be made much easier for the pulsators in eclipsing binaries .",
    "in addition , the commonly employed approximation of non - radial pulsations with single spherical harmonics becomes questionable for moderate rotation speeds already @xcite , and is certainly invalid in rapid rotators @xcite .",
    "many single delta scuti stars are quite rapid rotators @xcite , and rotation speeds of the same order are expected in binary systems with synchronized orbits . obviously , eclipse mapping is a more realistic approach for such cases than fitting patterns of some analytic form .    in the present paper",
    "we describe a variant of eclipse mapping method , _ dynamic eclipse mapping _ , designed to reconstruct the surface intensity patterns of nonradial pulsations in eclipsing binary stars .",
    "we show that , under plausible circumstances , its application makes the mode identification possible in a large variety of eclipsing binary scenarios .",
    "the method of eclipse mapping ( em ) was originally conceived to reconstruct the intensity distribution of radiation from accretion discs in eclipsing cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , with special emphasis on their radial temperature profile as a valuable diagnostic tool @xcite .",
    "its overwhelming success in different cv scenarios ( see @xcite for a summary ) has then inspired widespread applications in other , less exotic eclipsing systems too , like mapping surface brightness inhomogeneities ( spots ) in late - type close binaries ( e.g. xy  uma , * ? ? ? * ) or in w  uma stars ( e.g. vw  cep , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a simplified em was also used to estimate the surface temperature map of an exoplanet occulted by its host star @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the eclipse acts as a surface sampler that convolves the surface brightness distribution into the light curve .",
    "eclipse mapping does the inverse , it performs a deconvolution of the light curve into a surface pattern .",
    "the latter is treated as an _",
    "_ image__composed of pixels on an appropriate surface grid .",
    "no analytic assumptions are thus made on the surface brightness distribution , which allows the method to be maximally free of stellar interior and atmospheric models , and makes it particularly suited to confront model predictions with observations in a maximally unbiased manner .",
    "all it requires is a proper modelling of the eclipses and some basic atmosphere parameters .",
    "but because the convolution of a two - dimensional distribution into a one - dimensional time series implies a considerable loss of information , the inversion is ill - posed .",
    "the regularization is made by introducing additional , _ a priori _ information about the solution in the form of a _ regularization functional _",
    ", @xmath10 , which measures some desired property of the image @xmath11 .",
    "the solution is obtained by maximizing this functional with respect to the elements of @xmath11 and subject to the constraint of fitting the data at a prescribed level .",
    "the latter is usually measured by the chi - squared function .",
    "classical eclipse mapping uses the information entropy of the image as the regularization function , @xmath12 @xcite , which measures the negative of the information content of the image _ vector _",
    "@xmath11 against that of a _ reference map _ @xmath13 .",
    "the latter may be used to implement additional , user - defined preferences , or may be just a uniform map , scaled so that its total flux equals that of @xmath11 .",
    "the solution is then the image with the least structure ( relative to the reference map ) that can explain the observed data .",
    "other regularization methods may be employed equally well ; @xcite provide a thorough presentation of possibilities , while @xcite focuses on inverse problems found specifically in astronomy . in particular , the choice of the regularization functional @xmath14 depends on the type of the problem .",
    "for example , the information entropy is a good choice for positive images with uncorrelated pixels .",
    "physical maps are seldom uncorrelated ; but the correlation can be easily accounted for via the reference map ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : refmodel ] ) . alternatively ,",
    "the tikhonov functional @xmath15 @xcite and its derivatives , which measure the smoothness of the image , are also used in some cases , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the optimization can be accomplished by standard methods .",
    "most commonly it is transformed to a series of unconstrained optimizations by the method of lagrange multipliers , where the multiplier plays the role of the regularization parameter , which is tuned between the optimizations until the desired level of data fitting is achieved .",
    "@xcite give a sophisticated algorithm which accomplishes the two tasks in parallel , resulting in a robust and fast code .",
    "it is the algorithm that we have adopted in our implementation .",
    "previous applications of the eclipse mapping reconstructed surface structures that were _",
    "static _ in time , or at least implicitly considered static during the data collection period . in principle",
    "only the underlying model needs to be changed in order to handle the time - dependent patterns . the time dependence , however , has implications on other aspects too .",
    "the basic requirement of eclipse mapping is that the geometric configuration of the binary must be known .",
    "pulsations , however , cause a periodic variation of the stellar shape , hence also in the local gravity and other atmospheric conditions .",
    "their inclusion would require not only detailed atmospheric model ( see @xcite ) , but also the knowledge of the pulsation modes themselves .",
    "obviously , this is not feasible .",
    "fortunately , for small amplitude pulsations these effects can be neglected . indeed , for delta scuti stars , the observed amplitudes in radial velocities , combined with typical pulsation periods , yield negligible displacements compared to the stellar radius .",
    "variations of the surface normal could still be significant for high surface degree @xmath7 , but , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 . ) , photometrically detectable modes are limited by cancellation effect to @xmath16 .",
    "although the eclipses break the symmetry of the disc integration and may thus amplify some modes of even higher degree , those modes would still need to be detected outside the eclipses to have their frequency determined .",
    "therefore , these variations can be safely neglected in our case , and the star is considered a rigid body of known shape .    at the present stage",
    "we use spherical stars on circular orbits as the model of the binary .",
    "limb darkening is taken into account ( but its small variations with the local atmospheric conditions are again neglected ) , but we make no further assumptions about the stellar atmosphere , using fluxes of arbitrary spectral range .    for real , not - so detached systems , a proper account of the secondary s distorted shape may have to be made ; although we note that its projection on the sky during the eclipses is still close to circular , so we limited ourselves to spherical secondary for the evaluation of the method s capabilities .",
    "more stringent conditions are imposed on the pulsating star , for which rotation is a complicating factor . besides its physical influence on the pulsations , rotation has a simple geometric effect that the frequency detected in the observer s frame will differ from the physical frequency in the co - rotating frame , according to the relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angular rotation velocity , and @xmath8 is the azimuthal order of the mode . even if the rotation velocity were available , the physical frequency is unknown , because @xmath8 is also unknown , being one of the parameters sought by our analysis .",
    "the time dependence of the patterns on the rotating stellar surface being thus unavailable , they can not be mapped !",
    "what is known to us is the frequency of the patterns as seen on the visible , non - rotating stellar hemisphere .",
    "therefore we have to map those patterns , and infer the whole - surface patterns from them .",
    "obviously , this requires axial symmetry of both the stellar surface  in order for the shape of the disc to be constant in time  and of the pulsation patterns themselves  to assure that the surface and sky - projected patterns are equivalent , i.e. , the pulsation amplitudes and phases seen on the visible stellar hemisphere correspond to those of the intrinsic pattern .",
    "unfortunately , the above restriction excludes oscillations of a tidally distorted star to be mapped with this technique , because both the shape of the projected disc and the oscillation amplitudes do vary in time .",
    "oblique pulsators , characteristic of roap stars , would also be difficult to handle , the amplitudes being modulated by the stellar rotation @xcite . in this respect , wider systems , where binarity and pulsation are a mere coincidence , are the preferred targets for the dynamic eclipse mapping .",
    "we may turn now to the mathematical formulation . for small amplitudes",
    ", each pulsation mode can be written as a sinusoidally oscillating perturbation to the equilibrium intensity distribution of the star , so the time - dependent ( visible ) surface intensity pattern is the superposition of a static equilibrium map , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 sinusoidally oscillating patterns : @xmath21 ,   \\label{eq : surf - pattern}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the frequency of mode @xmath23 , and the cosine and sine maps @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been used rather than the amplitude and initial phase maps @xmath26 because they have the same units , of intensity .    in the linear adiabatic approximation and for slow rotation",
    ", the pulsation patterns would be described in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath27 . in the general approach , however , they are just pairs of images to be reconstructed .",
    "the dataset of integrated fluxes at @xmath28 discrete moments is obtained by convolving the image @xmath11 , composed of @xmath29 pixels , with an _ occultation kernel _ @xmath30 , an @xmath31 matrix , each row of which contains the pixels contribution factors to the specific datapoint .",
    "these factors are composed of the projected area of the visible pixel portion ( including the foreshortening factor ) , the limb darkening , and eventually other known factors incorporated into the model of the binary ( proximity effects , for example ) . with the image  ( [ eq : surf - pattern ] ) , and denoting the times as @xmath32 , the resulting synthetic dataset is @xmath33}}^{(\\nu)}_{\\phi k}\\,c^{(\\nu)}_k +              { k_{[\\rmn{s}]}}^{(\\nu)}_{\\phi k}\\,s^{(\\nu)}_k                          \\right ] , \\label{eq : convpuls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the cosine and sine kernels @xmath34}}^{(\\nu)}_{\\phi k }   & = & k_{\\phi k}\\,\\cos\\,(\\omega_\\nu t_\\phi),\\\\ { k_{[\\rmn{s}]}}^{(\\nu)}_{\\phi k }   & = & k_{\\phi k}\\,\\sin\\,(\\omega_\\nu t_\\phi ) , \\end{array } \\label{eq : newkern}\\ ] ] obtainable from scaling the rows of the base kernel @xmath30 with the corresponding cosine and sine time factors . with this notation , equation ( [ eq : convpuls ] ) can be written in a compact vectorial - tensorial form as : @xmath35}}^{(\\nu ) } \\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\bmath{c}}}^{(\\nu ) } +         { { \\mathbfss{k}}_{[\\mathrm{s}]}}^{(\\nu ) } \\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\bmath{s}}}^{(\\nu ) }       \\right).\\ ] ] thus the known time dependence is transferred into the kernels , so that the model parameters are : i ) one map for the static pattern , @xmath19 , and ii ) a pair of cosine and sine maps @xmath36 for each pulsation mode , making together @xmath37 independent maps in total .",
    "the task is to estimate the @xmath38 maps for a known kernel @xmath30 , and a given set of frequencies @xmath22 @xmath39 as well as the light curve @xmath40 .",
    "the kernel is provided by the model for the binary , while the frequencies and the light curve are the observed data .      because the pulsation patterns @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not strictly positive but may contain values of either sign , the entropy expression ( [ eq : cross - entropy ] ) is not valid for them ( it can still be used for the static pattern @xmath19 , though ) . for @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "we selected a simple quadratic regularization function , of form @xmath43 which also includes a reference map @xmath13 .",
    "this function is in fact a generalized tikhonov functional , although we arrived at it through the statistical approach to inverse problems @xcite , where the regularization function can be interpreted as the logarithm of an _ a priori _ probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the parameters .",
    "the above quadratic expression may be recognized as the logarithm of a joint gaussian pdf , apart from a constant .",
    "the gaussian is considered the most generic pdf ( or most noncommittal with regard to missing information ) when only the first two moments of the parameter are available ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  7 and 11 ) . in our case , the first moment  the expectation value ",
    "is given by the reference map @xmath13 , while the second moment ",
    "the spread  plays the role of the regularization parameter .",
    "( similarly , the entropy expression  ( [ eq : cross - entropy ] ) is the logarithm of a poissonian pdf , with mean pixel values given in the reference map @xmath13 , e.g , @xcite . )    the entropy expression  ( [ eq : cross - entropy ] ) for the equilibrium intensity map and the quadratic functionals  ( [ eq : quad - reg ] ) for the pulsation patterns must then be _ simultaneously _ optimized , subject to a common constraint @xmath44 .",
    "a pair of maps belonging to one mode may be handled as a single entity , their regularization functions are simply summed up , so we have @xmath45 objective functions to optimize , each on its subset of variables .",
    "this multiobjective optimization problem can be transformed with the simple weighting method to a single optimization of their weighted sum @xmath46 , with the weights determined by the desideratum that all maps should have about the same smoothness ( as measured by the value of the regularization function ) .",
    "because the objectives only interfere indirectly with each other via the common data fitting constraint ( they have disjunct subsets of variables ) , the _ ideal point method _ can be employed for computing the weights ( see @xcite , for the aforementioned methods ) .",
    "this involves performing @xmath45 optimizations first , with only one objective active at a time , but with all maps being fitted",
    ". a higher range of achieved values for an objective means more room to make the corresponding maps smoother , and translates to a higher weight in the final optimization run .",
    "we have found the variable chi algorithm described by @xcite quite useful in setting up a reliable criterion for data fitting .",
    "they introduced a so - called @xmath47-statistics measuring the correlations of the neighboring residuals .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath47 and @xmath48 statistics are proportional to each other , and setting a goal value for @xmath47 as @xmath49 provides a more data - independent fitting criterion for @xmath48  automatic noise scaling , in fact .",
    "the stopping criterion of the iterations was the same as in @xcite .",
    "after reaching a good fitting to the data , the iterations were continued until a test value , which measures the parallelism between the gradients of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , decreased below a certain value in all subsets .",
    "being half the sine of the angle between the two involved vectors ( in terms of the scalar product ) , test takes values from @xmath52 to @xmath53",
    ". the algorithm could routinely reach below test=@xmath54 , which we chose as the stopping value .",
    "the role of the reference map @xmath13 appearing in the regularization functionals is to allow the introduction of additional user preferences about the solution . in",
    "highly ill - posed inverse problems like eclipse mapping , where every bit of a priori knowledge is important , it may have a determining role in obtaining a proper solution .",
    "the regularization functionals have their global maximum at the location of the reference map , which therefore is the default solution in the absence of observational constraints .",
    "regular solutions will also be as close to it as allowed by the constraints .",
    "updating the reference map from the instantaneous solution during the iterative solving procedure is a common technique to make it control the image property to be measured by the regularization function , which is hence optimized in the solution ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples in accretion disc reconstructions ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be set to a uniform map if no additional preferences exist ; in this case we obtain a most uniform , but spatially uncorrelated , solution : permuting the pixels will not change the value of the regularization function at all .",
    "this is better than nothing ; but most problems do have some symmetry , and employing it improves the solution .    the pulsation patterns of a rotationally symmetric star , when described in a spherical coordinate system tied to the rotation axis , obey a kind of axial symmetry , in that the local amplitude only depends on the latitude , while the local phase only varies with the longitude .",
    "this holds not only for spherical harmonics , but for all pulsations of tidally _ _ un__distorted stars  including fast rotators , for example .",
    "consequently all the cosine and sine maps are expected to have the form @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the co - latitude and longitude , respectively . on a uniform spherical grid ,",
    "therefore , we have a discrete number of amplitudes @xmath59 and initial phases @xmath60 , that completely describe the maps @xmath41 and @xmath42 on that same grid : @xmath61    according to this a priori expectation , we set up the following updating scheme for the reference maps .",
    "the algorithm starts with computing flat - valued images by linear least - squares fitting to the data .",
    "the reference maps are initialized with the same images .",
    "after the end of each iteration the latest @xmath62 solutions are interpolated onto a uniform spherical grid around the rotation axis , of appropriate resolution . the non - linear model ( [ eq : ref - model ] ) with the parameters @xmath63 is fitted to the maps , by a standard levenberg ",
    "marquardt algorithm .",
    "spatial correlations are then taken into account by smoothing the resulting discretized amplitude and phase profiles with a gaussian of a user - supplied angular correlation length . from the smoothed profiles ,",
    "new @xmath62 maps are computed and interpolated back to the reconstruction grid , giving the reference maps for the next iteration . for the equilibrium map @xmath19",
    ", only a surface gaussian smearing is applied ; this takes spatial correlations into account ( i.e. , to yield a smooth image ) .",
    "a few safety measures were needed for proper operation of the above procedure .",
    "these include a careful estimation of starting parameter values for the non - linear model fitting algorithm , as well as making the smoothing wraparound for the phase profiles ( running along the longitude ) and mirrored at the poles for the amplitude profiles , in order to ensure continuity over the stellar surface .",
    "the same procedure is used when amplitude and phase profiles are derived from the final solution for the purpose of mode identification , with the difference that the profiles are not smoothed .",
    "the above scheme only works for a known rotation axis .",
    "stars in eclipsing binaries are generally assumed to have the rotation axis perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "this assumption is expected to hold for close binaries , where tidal interactions tend to bring the spin axes parallel to the orbital axis , in addition to circularizing the orbits . for wider systems , which are of primary interest for us ( sec .",
    "[ sec : assumptions ] ) , it may not be true , as demonstrated by the recent discovery of very oblique rotation axes ( being almost in the orbital plane ) in the eccentric system di  her @xcite .",
    "if the rotation axis is unknown , then only the assumption of smoothness can be used , leading to a smoothest solution , which will for certain be inferior to the regular solution , and may be insufficient for mode identification . assuming a wrong axis would do even worse , though .",
    "we note that the seemingly ad - hoc manipulation of the reference map may be justified within the frame of the bayesian approach : each iteration is a prior - to - posterior processing step , and the reference map updating only prepares the prior for the next iteration from the posterior of the last iteration , by propagating only those structures that are consistent with the a priori expectations , and ignoring everything else .",
    "the amount of recoverable surface structure information depends primarily on how the surface is sampled by the eclipses .",
    "uneclipsed regions , for example , can not be reconstructed ; but we can not ignore them either because they contribute to the integrated flux .",
    "therefore pixels within these regions are fitted , but not regularized. being spatially unresolvable , the uneclipsed region is replaced by a single parameter , a _ virtual pixel _",
    ", with its contribution factor equivalent to that of the whole region .",
    "the value of this pixel is simply copied to the virtual pixel of the corresponding reference map during the updating scheme , therefore it gives zero net contribution to the regularization function , but still counts to the goodness - of - fit .",
    "this technique also prevents an unnecessary proliferation of the parameters .",
    "each map has its own virtual pixel of this kind ; the one pertaining to the static intensity map takes in addition the duty of fitting any other uneclipsed flux ( third light ) in the system .",
    "although systems with total eclipses seem at first sight the most favorable scenery for em because they sample the whole stellar surface , the actual situation is more subtle . on one hand , there is no useful data from the totality phases of the light curve , so the amount of information may be less than with partial eclipses . on the other hand , higher inclinations  for which the eclipses become total  do not necessarily imply a better reconstruction . as the system approaches the edge - on configuration , the eclipses start to sample multiple areas in exactly the same way .",
    "this latter is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : egeom ] .",
    "the ingress and egress arcs , corresponding to the companion s projected limb on the stellar disc at various orbital phases , form a sampling grid. each pixel of the grid is eclipsed at one phase interval and reappears at another , contributing to exactly two data points of the differential light curve , interpreted in terms of flux changes from phase to phase .",
    "the left panel shows a configuration in which all the ingress and egress arcs intersect each other in at most one point . the right panel in turn presents a configuration in which most arcs have two intersection points , so there are pairs of pixels that are eclipsed simultaneously and reappear simultaneously",
    ". no inversion method will be able to separate their contribution from each other .     and",
    "@xmath64 , seen under inclinations of @xmath65 ( _ left panel _ ) and @xmath66 ( _ right panel _ ) , respectively .",
    "the secondary sweeps across the primary in the horizontal direction .",
    "the white upper areas are never eclipsed .",
    "each shade of the grey - coloured pixels marks one specific chain of equivalent pixel pairs on the right panel .",
    "one such pair is highlighted with thick black lines .",
    "both panels also show a pixel with no equivalent pair .",
    "[ fig : egeom ] , title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]   and @xmath64 , seen under inclinations of @xmath65 ( _ left panel _ ) and @xmath66 ( _ right panel _ ) , respectively . the secondary sweeps across the primary in the horizontal direction .",
    "the white upper areas are never eclipsed .",
    "each shade of the grey - coloured pixels marks one specific chain of equivalent pixel pairs on the right panel .",
    "one such pair is highlighted with thick black lines .",
    "both panels also show a pixel with no equivalent pair .",
    "[ fig : egeom ] , title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]    it is easy to see that these equivalent pixel pairs are arranged symmetrically with respect to the trajectory of the secondary s centre , projected on the sky .",
    "if the trajectory intersects the primary s disc , then there will be a horizontal band similar to that of the uneclipsed region , full of equivalent pixel pairs , and therefore it is an _ ambiguous region _ , for which the reconstruction is likely to be distorted .",
    "the remaining area in between represents the _ trusted region _ , for which the unique sampling makes a trustworthy reconstruction possible .",
    "the vertical extents of the limiting regions can be easily computed for spherical stars .",
    "they are also approximately valid for real stellar shapes , if polar radii are used .",
    "thus , for stellar radii @xmath67 and @xmath68 , binary separation @xmath69 , and inclination @xmath70 , the uneclipsed region has a fractional height @xmath71 , while for the ambiguous region it is @xmath72 , all in units of the stellar diameter . for inclinations larger than @xmath73 ,",
    "the eclipses are total ( formally @xmath74 ) .",
    "the ambiguous region disappears for inclinations smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "inclinations between these two limits correspond to the best cases , in which the whole stellar disc is unambiguously sampled .",
    "however , the existence of such an optimal range requires that @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77 ; that is , the secondary must be at least twice as large as the primary .",
    "although such systems may exist , in most cases the secondary is not so much larger .",
    "in addition , not all systems show total eclipses .",
    "the reconstruction therefore will always be compromised to some extent by the limits of the eclipse geometry .",
    "but since partial eclipses may not be as bad compared to total eclipses as it may seem at first , any inclination for which the whole eclipsed region is uniquely sampled is close to optimal .",
    "if the eclipses are central ( @xmath78 ) , eclipse mapping will only reconstruct modes that are symmetric with respect to the orbital plane . in an aligned rotator , asymmetric modes ( @xmath79 )",
    "are subject to complete cancellation @xcite , which also persists during the eclipses due to their symmetry , so only symmetric modes are detected anyway . however , in an oblique rotator ( not pulsator ! ) , non - symmetric modes will be sampled in a symmetric way , and therefore will not be properly reconstructed . such edge - on systems",
    "are expected to be rare , though .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : egeom ] it is also clear that the resolution of the sampling decreases in the vertical direction , so the southern regions ( from the observer s point of view ) will be reconstructed with poorer quality .",
    "there is no such intrinsically uneven sampling in the horizontal direction .",
    "hence , for an aligned rotator , the phase profile will be reconstructed reasonably well , which allows a reliable identification of @xmath8 ; but the amplitude profile will suffer from imperfections in the southern parts . fortunately , for the rotationally symmetric pulsations appropriate for the method it suffices to know the pattern on one half of the stellar hemisphere in order to identify the modes , so the eclipse geometry might not have a dramatic impact on the mode identification . on the other hand ,",
    "an oblique rotator has more subtle implications , and the above arguments are not applicable ; both profiles will be affected to some extent by the uneven vertical sampling .    to investigate how the limitations discussed above affect the reconstructions ,",
    "we have selected four system configurations for testing ( two distinct systems viewed under two different inclination angles each ) , listed in table  [ table : systems ] , and representing various levels of optimality , as indicated by the heights of the key regions .",
    "system  1 is an ideal system , with the secondary more than twice as large as the primary and an inclination which enables unambiguous sampling of the whole surface and makes the eclipses total .",
    "system  2 is the same system seen at a higher inclination , with an ambiguous region .",
    "system  3 features both an uneclipsed and an ambiguous region , while system  4 has almost total eclipses but an ambiguous region of considerable area .",

    ". a formal mode identification would give @xmath81 and @xmath82 , totally erroneous because mode  2 already has this set of ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "there is no such problem with the higher inclination case , though .",
    "we conclude that although small errors in the binary parameters are not a serious obstacle against a successful em , they may cause a misidentification of the more complex modes .",
    "another important factor is the limb darkening .",
    "the oscillation amplitude caused by a given mode in the whole - disc integrated flux depends significantly on the adopted limb darkening law , and so does the magnitude of the modulations during the eclipses .",
    "all our previous runs have been made with the assumption of a linear limb darkening law . with the full polynomial law",
    ", all modes would produce larger distortions during the eclipses  sometimes by orders of magnitude , as is the case for @xmath82 modes , for instance .",
    "the overall pattern of the distortions , however , remains the same .",
    "the net effect is that em would give false amplitudes for the maps , but the pattern would not be modified , therefore the mode identification is not hampered by small errors in the limb darkening .",
    "we did check the above conjecture by additional tests , although we limited ourselves to linear and polynomial limb darkening laws for the _ same _ stellar model , because it is enough to induce changes near the disc limb  the place where the differences really matter for the eclipse mapping .",
    "the coefficients were taken from @xcite .",
    "light curves were generated for a couple of selected modes ( @xmath82 cases inclusive ) with polynomial limb darkening , then eclipse mapped with the linear law .",
    "the other possible combinations were also performed , and the results confirm the expected behavior .",
    "the amplitudes indeed varied greatly , but the nodal points of the amplitude profile and the slope of the phase profile both remained the same .",
    "we do not show them here because a similar case occurs implicitly in the tests of the next section .",
    "due to symmetries in the pulsation patterns , for each mode there are certain axial orientations for which the condition of partial or complete cancellation occurs , that is , the integration over the visible stellar hemisphere gives zero net flux variation .",
    "for example , all antisymmetric modes ( with @xmath84 ) seen edge - on , as well as all sectoral modes seen pole - on , are subject to cancellation . for each mode",
    "there are also certain intermediate angles at which complete cancellation occurs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an extensive study ) .",
    "now in eclipsing binaries the inclination of the orbit is close to @xmath85 .",
    "antisymmetric modes on an aligned rotator thus will be close to the condition of complete cancellation .",
    "they show up during the eclipses however , because the symmetry of the surface integration that led to the cancellation effect is lifted on a partially non - centrally occulted disc ( provided that the system is only close to , but not exactly at the edge - on configuration ) . because it is customary in time series analysis to ignore the data segments affected by the eclipses so as to avoid the complications ( sidelobes and false peaks ) caused by modulated sinusoids",
    ", such hidden modes may go undetected .",
    "therefore their signal , amplified during the eclipses and unaccounted for by any frequency , certainly will affect the reconstruction .",
    "the aligned rotator with multiple modes presented in section  [ sec : multimode ] contains in fact such a hidden mode , @xmath86 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , @xmath82 modes were found to be extremely sensitive on the assumed limb darkening .",
    "so we repeated exactly that case , this time with a non - linear limb darkening .",
    "[ fig : mm3-ldeffect ] compares the generated light curves , also separately showing the contributions of each individual mode .",
    "the second mode , @xmath86 , is practically hidden , giving almost zero net flux variation outside , but a significant contribution during the eclipses .",
    ".,width=317 ]         , width=317 ]    to fully simulate the effect of hidden modes , we searched for frequencies in the artificial data rather than using the model values .",
    "for this purpose a larger dataset was generated , covering @xmath5 consecutive eclipses but extending over almost the full orbital cycle , in order to contain enough data for a time series analysis .",
    "we used the program period04 @xcite to derive the frequencies , after having cut out the segments affected by the eclipses .",
    "the dataset could be perfectly fitted with two frequencies @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are very close to the input values ( lines 1 and 3 in table  [ table:3mode - params ] ) .",
    "we then fed these two frequencies and the original dataset to the em .",
    "the algorithm had trouble in achieving a good fit to the data .",
    "the lowest attainable values for the r - statistics were @xmath89 , implying @xmath90 , and gave very messy images .",
    "thus we had to significantly relax the fitting criteria from @xmath91 to @xmath92 for an acceptable solution ; the @xmath48 also increased accordingly to @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : mm3-em - fit - with - two ] shows large residuals that the algorithm could not fit , those being due to the hidden mode . that they were not falsely mapped on the other modes is reassuring , in fact .",
    "indeed , the modes could be successfully restored , though with a higher uncertainty , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm3-em - maps - with - two ] .",
    "when we included the eclipses in the time series analysis , even @xmath94 frequencies were not enough to properly account for the modulations during the eclipses .",
    "two of these frequencies corresponded to modes 1 and 3 , and a third frequency was near to that of the hidden mode , but its amplitude was of the same order as of other @xmath95 peaks in the spectrum .",
    "this is not unexpected , since a purely fourier - based spectral analysis is only appropriate for purely harmonic oscillations . on the other hand",
    ", subtracting the model fitted by em from the original dataset leaves us with a much cleaner residual light curve , because now em properly accounts for the distortion effect of the eclipses on the two modes with known frequencies .",
    "a fourier spectral analysis of these residuals is still cumbersome , with period04 giving two main frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 but still nothing at the location of the true frequency @xmath98 .",
    "more specific approaches would be needed for this purpose .",
    "we mention one promising technique described in @xcite , which , with an appropriately designed model , is expected to handle the modulations of the amplitude and the instantaneous frequency caused by the eclipses .",
    "nevertheless , our investigation demonstrates a certain immunity of em against the pollution by the hidden modes , in that they do not jeopardize the reconstruction of the other modes ; moreover , em is able to properly isolate their contribution from the detected modes .",
    "of course , we are aware that the simple approach outlined above may not work as efficiently in real circumstances . for example , multiple hidden modes may produce residuals that could be isolated only with the inclusion of an unrealistically large number of eclipses , or even worse , could lead to a combination that can not be isolated from the signal of the detected modes .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the dynamic eclipse mapping method , designed to reconstruct the pulsation patterns of non - radially oscillating components in eclipsing binaries , with the goal of mode identification .",
    "the method uses the effective surface sampling of the eclipses and provides image - like information on the pulsation patterns , which eventually enables a direct mode identification , without the need to invoke detailed models of stellar structure and atmosphere . only a geometric model for the binary and a few simple assumptions on the stellar atmosphere",
    "are needed .",
    "the method takes the detected frequencies and the eclipse light curve as input data , and furnishes pairs of images for each mode , completely describing its spatial and temporal behavior .",
    "a particular advantage of the method is that it can in principle operate on any wavelength range , including wide - band photometric data , making the datasets obtained in space observatories potentially useful for more than time series analysis .",
    "we have performed extensive testing of the dynamic eclipse mapping . based on these tests",
    ", we can make the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "the reconstructions do not depend dramatically on the eclipse geometry .",
    "in particular , partial eclipses are not an obstacle , provided that their contribution is properly treated in terms of regularization and fitting .",
    "we believe that the use of an axially symmetric reference map updating scheme is essential in providing this rather nice property .",
    "inclinations very close to @xmath85 , however , are less favorable cases , due to the increasing symmetry of the eclipses surface sampling .",
    "2 .   chances for a successful mode identification decrease with an increasing complexity of the pulsation pattern in the direction perpendicular to the secondary s projected orbit , measured roughly by @xmath99 .",
    "there is no such limit in the horizontal direction .",
    "multimode pulsations can also be reconstructed , provided that the data cover a sufficient number of individual eclipses . although we only presented a case with @xmath100 simultaneous modes",
    ", there is no procedural obstacle in reconstructing a larger number of simultaneous pulsations , if the eclipse coverage is large enough to allow a proper separation of all the detected modes .",
    "the triple mode case required @xmath101 eclipses , a dozen of modes would certainly need much more , which calls for uninterrupted space - based observations , and probably needs a lot more computational time as well .",
    "modes resonant with the orbital motion are problematic in that the inclusion of subsequent eclipses ( after a certain limit , determined by the resonant cycle ) will not improve the reconstruction . for single modes , one cycle may be enough anyway , but for multiple modes it is certainly a limitation that no other inversion method would be able to overcome .",
    "tidally excited pulsations fall into this category , as well as the rotational splitting of modes in tidally locked systems , where the difference of the frequencies is in 1:1 resonance with the orbital motion .",
    "pulsations on an oblique rotator can be reconstructed with similar conditions as in the aligned case , assuming that the direction of the rotation axis is known . without this essential information",
    ", em can not give any useful results , while wrong assumptions about it will almost surely cause false mode identification .",
    "moderate errors in the geometric parameters are tolerable , although they may cause false identification of the more complex modes .",
    "a correct account for the limb darkening is also important . in particular",
    ", it is crucial to go beyond the generic linear limb darkening relation , otherwise the reconstructed amplitudes may become too distorted .",
    "this requirement should no cause any difficulty though , with the observational accuracy achievable these days . 7 .",
    "the method tolerates the presence of hidden modes and is able to properly isolate their polluting effect , so that they do nt hinder the proper identification of the other modes .",
    "based on the above findings , an ideal target for the method would be a moderately wide system , with no significant tidal distortions of the pulsating component(s ) , no resonant pulsations , yet not as wide as to have an eccentric orbit , so that the rotation axis may be assumed aligned with the orbital axis .",
    "this latter problem may be overcome by high - resolution spectroscopic observations that could reveal the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect and infer a spin axis from it , as it was done for di  herculis @xcite .",
    "the effect has already been detected in rz  cas @xcite , and the possibility is open for other cases as well .",
    "our method does not require that the pulsation patterns be of spherical harmonics type ; only rotational symmetry must hold for the modes . in principle , modes distorted by rapid rotation of the pulsating component can also be investigated . @xcite",
    "have shown that fast rotation causes an equatorial concentration of the pulsation amplitude , while the azimuthal structure is unchanged , so the modes obey the same symmetry as assumed by our method .",
    "in addition , it was also shown by the same authors that the number of horizontal surface node lines remains the same , with small shifts in their positions .",
    "therefore the overall topological structure of the modes is unchanged , making them suitable for mapping with em .",
    "moreover , some of the rotationally distorted modes have a larger disc averaging factor than their zero rotation equivalents , making them more easily detectable , and ultimately allowing the detection of higher degree modes with @xmath7 up to @xmath102 . only at extremely high speeds",
    "does the equatorial concentration flatten the amplitude profile ( except for a small equatorial region ) to the extent that any topological information becomes too weak to recognize .",
    "we did not deal with distorted modes in this study , though , because we believe that the importance of such an extension will be settled by the outcome of the first real - world applications .",
    "the simple binary model used here was appropriate for assessing the usability of the dynamic eclipse mapping method .",
    "successful applications obviously will require a more detailed model for the binary , but we expect that the inclusion of the neglected features and effects is a computational issue , and should not endanger the success of the mode identification .",
