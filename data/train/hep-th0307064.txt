    "the purpose of this article is to describe a procedure that starts from a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with only one flavor of massive quarks and produces the schrdinger equation for heavy quarkonia in a single formulation of the theory .",
    "only the first approximation for the final hamiltonian is evaluated . in this simplest version ,",
    "the procedure involves a guess for the gluon mass term .",
    "but the guess appears to have little influence on the result .",
    "the procedure itself is not limited to the simplest version and the gluon mass ansatz can be tested in future in refined calculations and phenomenology . the procedure is relativistic and can be used for quarkonia in arbitrary motion , which is a pre - requisite for application in high - energy processes .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken in the case of heavy quarks and the issue of the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry is ignored .",
    "the approach described here stems from the similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians @xcite , which has been applied to qcd @xcite using the light - front ( lf ) form of dynamics @xcite .",
    "a new ingredient is the boost - invariant creation and annihilation operator calculus for effective quarks and gluons ( see below ) .",
    "otherwise , the lf approach is known for a long time , mainly as a candidate for connecting two qualitatively different models of hadrons : the parton model in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) @xcite and the constituent model in the rest frame of a hadron @xcite .",
    "many contributions in that area @xcite have followed the seminal work on exclusive processes @xcite . through the boost invariance and",
    "precisely defined notion of effective constituents , the approach described here aims at providing a bridge between the two models of hadrons in a single theoretical framework .",
    "the case of a heavy quarkonium is chosen here as the simplest one to begin with and test the method .    in the lf dynamics",
    ", the evolution of states is traced along the direction of a light - like four - vector @xmath6 , for which @xmath7 .",
    "with the conventional choice of @xmath8 , the variable @xmath9 plays the role of time while @xmath10 is the hamiltonian . in order to define it for bare particles in qcd",
    ", one has to choose a gauge .",
    "no serious alternative exists to @xmath11 .",
    "but the equation @xmath12 implies a constraint that is analogous to the gauss law and forces the fourier components of @xmath13 to contain inverse powers of the kinematical momentum @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath14 ranges from 0 to infinity , the inverse powers of @xmath14 produce singularities in the region around zero .",
    "one can impose a lower bound on @xmath14 , such as @xmath15 , to regulate the theory @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 becomes a smallest unit of momentum that any particle , physical or virtual , can carry in such discretized theories .",
    "but the fixed unit breaks the boost invariance required for connection between the imf and the rest frame of any hadron .",
    "namely , when some physically relevant @xmath17 is made large , the smallest allowed @xmath18 becomes small . in the imf @xmath19 and the same small-@xmath20 divergences re - appear despite the presence of @xmath16 .",
    "the key singularity is related to the @xmath21 distribution of gluons in the parton model and seems to require a dynamical mechanism to remove .",
    "one can not just vary @xmath16 together with @xmath17 because boosts can not change the cutoff in a quantum theory constructed _ ab initio _ @xcite .",
    "there exists a possibility that the small-@xmath14 singularities are related to the properties of the vacuum state .",
    "the sum rules for heavy quarkonia @xcite include quark and gluon condensates @xcite that may participate in the dynamics in the small-@xmath14 region @xcite . in the qcd picture with such nontrivial ground state @xcite , and relativistic bound - state excitations of this state in the form of @xmath22-mesons , one can hardly hope to resolve the small-@xmath14 singularity easily .",
    "the situation simplifies a lot in the case of quarks with mass @xmath23 . the small-@xmath20 singularity and a non - perturbative binding mechanism for quarks and gluons can interplay with each other without interference from the vacuum . in the case of light quarks",
    ", a similar interplay may be at work and contribute to the saturation mechanism of partons @xcite , but that issue is not addressed here .    the gluon mass ansatz is introduced to represent effects of the non - abelian interactions .",
    "the ansatz is inserted at the level of solving the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is the renormalization group ( rg ) parameter .",
    "the procedure of introducing the mass ansatz is similar to the one proposed in @xcite and later discussed in simplified matrix models @xcite .",
    "new elements are the limitation of power counting to the relative - motion variables , the exact boost invariance , removal of small-@xmath20 divergences through the mass ansatz as a function of the relative momenta , and no need for ad hoc potentials in the first approximation .",
    "all these features will be described in detail later .    in brief , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the kinetic energy operator made of all terms that are bilinear in the creation and annihilation operators for the effective particles , and @xmath26 represents all other terms .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 defines the width of momentum - space form factors in @xmath26 . for some value of @xmath27 gev",
    ", one can freely add to @xmath28 a term of the form @xmath29\\mu^2 $ ] , where @xmath30 .",
    "the number 2 ensures that corrections to the first approximation occur first in the fourth - order of expansion of @xmath28 in powers of @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "this is the lowest order at which a perturbative shift in the gluon energy in any state can influence the contribution of that state to the dynamics of any other state in perturbation theory , keeping intact the qed - like small coupling expansion scheme with a coulomb potential .",
    "@xmath4 stands for the mass term that one assigns to the effective gluons of the transverse size @xmath33 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath34 as the spatial size of the color charge distribution in the corresponding effective particles is based on the feature mentioned above that @xmath26 contains vertex form factors of width @xmath3 in momentum space .",
    "the mass ansatz contributes to the invariant masses through @xmath35 , where @xmath20 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum carried by the gluon .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the large , relativistic value of the coupling constant in qcd at the scale @xmath37 with a true @xmath38 in this scheme . the term with @xmath4 vanishes for @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , only @xmath4 counts when the ratio @xmath40 is small .",
    "thus , in the weak coupling expansion , @xmath41 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the term @xmath42 $ ] is treated as a source of small corrections in comparison to @xmath4 .",
    "the requirement of cancellation of the small-@xmath20 singularities in the effective dynamics imposes some perturbatively determined constraints on the otherwise non - perturbative ansatz for @xmath4 .",
    "these constraints restrict the behavior of @xmath4 as a function of the gluon motion with respect to other constituents . in future",
    ", the refined versions of the same procedure may provide constraints that come closer to the actual behavior of gluons .",
    "this behavior is hoped to be uncovered in computer simulations that one may build around the first approximation .",
    "then , the extrapolation to @xmath39 can recover the original theory from a few terms in the weak - coupling expansion if @xmath4 approximates the behavior of effective gluons well .",
    "initially , the gluon mass term is viewed as a function of the relative momenta and @xmath38 .",
    "the latter depends on @xmath43 as @xmath44 with a positive constant @xmath45 .",
    "this means that @xmath38 vanishes to all orders in the perturbative expansion , and @xmath4 is considered to be on the order of 1 . before one knows more , @xmath46 can only be estimated on the basis of implications for the resulting schrdinger equation .",
    "the size of @xmath46 can be compared with four scales : @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath0 , and the bohr momentum scale , @xmath47 , which is distinguished non - perturbatively by the coulomb interaction .",
    "but if @xmath4 is right , then @xmath48 $ ] must be a source of only small corrections in the whole range of couplings between 0 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is taken for granted in the present article . since the first approximation turns out to be not sensitive to the details of @xmath46 , new information can be obtained only in the refined calculations .",
    "the value of the weak coupling expansion scheme for hamiltonians is that it starts from a local theory and leads to @xmath1 that is capable of describing physically relevant non - perturbative dynamics even if @xmath1 is calculated only in low orders .",
    "this idea is known to work in the case of qed : the coulomb potential accounts for highly non - perturbative dynamics of atoms , including the nature of chemical bond , while the hamiltonian itself is only of the formal order of @xmath49 .",
    "condensed matter physics illustrates this point in still wider domain .",
    "but when one applies the weak coupling expansion idea to qcd @xcite , one faces the fact that the strong coupling constant rises to 10 , 30 , or even 100 times larger value than in the case of atoms or positronium in qed .",
    "this leads to a complex interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative parts of the calculation , enhanced dependence of observables on the rg parameter @xmath3 , problems with obtaining the poincare symmetry in solutions , and amplification of artifacts due to the small-@xmath14 regularization .",
    "most of the problems seem to come from perturbation theory in the rg part of the calculation . an exact rg procedure by definition provides @xmath1",
    "whose structure depends on @xmath3 but the spectra and @xmath50-matrix elements do not .",
    "however , when one uses expansion in powers of @xmath43 and then extrapolates to @xmath39 , a considerable dependence of the eigensolutions on @xmath3 can ensue because of missing many terms .",
    "this is visible in models that are asymptotically free and produce bound states @xcite .",
    "one has to find the right value for @xmath36 at given @xmath37 from fits to bound - state observables , and perform consistency checks for whole sets of different observables @xcite . in qcd ,",
    "such checks involve the unknown functions of momenta in the finite parts of the ultraviolet counterterms , unknown terms depending on @xmath38 , and artifacts of the regularization of small-@xmath14 divergences .",
    "so many unknowns suggest the possibility that the approach may never achieve the desired level of predictive power .",
    "but the simplicity of the harmonic potential found here in the first approximation illustrates that there is a high degree of order in the rich structure of @xmath1 .",
    "it is a consequence of preserving all seven kinematical symmetries of the lf scheme in the rg procedure .",
    "these symmetries limit the large number of terms that are allowed by the lf power counting using absolute momentum variables @xcite , to a much smaller number of terms that depend only on the relative momenta of the constituents .",
    "the lf symmetries must also be respected by the initial regularization prescription for the required counterterms to be simple .",
    "the renormalization group procedure for effective particles ( rgep ) , which is employed here , regulates the ultra - violet and small-@xmath14 divergences by vertex factors @xmath51 that are inserted only in the interaction terms . in the case of the small-@xmath14 singularities , these factors limit only the ratios of momenta @xmath14 .",
    "the ratios are limited from below by a dimensionless parameter @xmath52 .",
    "details of the factors @xmath53 are explained later .",
    "every creation or annihilation operator , labeled by momentum @xmath14 , enters the initial interaction hamiltonian together with a corresponding factor @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the sum of all momenta that label all creation operators , or , equivalently , all annihilation operators in the same interaction term ( see appendix [ a : h ] ) . in qcd with @xmath57 , @xmath1 contains the coupling constant @xmath58 , which depends on the scale @xmath3 in the same asymptotically free way @xcite that characterizes the running coupling constant dependence on the renormalization scale in the feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians @xmath28 with small @xmath37 are worth studying because their eigenstates can be expanded in the effective particle basis in the fock space and the wave functions in this expansion are expected to correspond to the constituent picture of hadrons .",
    "this is envisioned in analogy to the models based on yukawa theory @xcite .",
    "the interactions are suppressed by the form factors and can not copiously create new constituents , even if the coupling constant @xmath43 becomes large .",
    "exotic hadron states may have their probability distributions shifted in the number of effective particles above the constituent quark model values of 2 or 3 @xcite .",
    "the effective dynamics can be in agreement with requirements of special relativity even if it is limited to a small number of effective constituents , and the rgep provides rules for constructing the representation of the poincare group @xcite .",
    "but the key feature is that the transition between the bare and effective degrees of freedom is made in one and the same formalism .",
    "there is no need to match different formulations of the theory , such as in the case of lattice theory and the continuum perturbation theory in the minkowski space @xcite , with none of the parts meant to cover the whole range of relevant scales on its own .",
    "one more comment is required concerning the small-@xmath20 divergences in the eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 . in the initial studies that used @xmath16 to limit bare particles momenta and employed coupling coherence to derive certain @xmath1 @xcite",
    ", one could keep only a quark - anti - quark sector in the corresponding eigenvalue problem and the resulting equation was finite in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , no small-@xmath14 divergences were encountered in the case of gluonium approximated by states of only two gluons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present rgep approach demands inclusion of states that contain an additional effective gluon which is needed to cancel small-@xmath20 divergences .",
    "for example , if one keeps only a pair of the effective quark and anti - quark , the leading non - relativistic ( nr ) terms are free from the small-@xmath20 singularities @xcite but relativistic corrections are singular @xcite .",
    "when the additional gluon is included , the condition of cancellation of the small-@xmath20 divergences becomes a guide in understanding the gluon dynamics .",
    "the rules of including the gluons must be brought under quantitative control and the well - known case of heavy quarkonia provides a laboratory for testing the approach based on the gluon mass ansatz .",
    "the tests require a first approximation to begin with and a candidate is identified in the next sections .",
