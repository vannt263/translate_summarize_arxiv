    "this note may be viewed as a sequel to what we once called  the trilogy \" normann @xcite .",
    "there we were interested in typed structures of continuous functions over complete separable metric spaces .",
    "we used the , for our purpose equivalent , cartesian closed categories of @xmath0 ( @xcite ) and kuratowski limit spaces ( @xcite ) .    in computational analysis",
    "it is customary to work with tte - representations , see , e.g. , weihrauch  @xcite , or alternatively with domain representations .",
    "the main observation in @xcite was that if we restrict ourselves to the limit space representation and ignore tte - representations or domain representations , we obtain more informative results with simpler proofs .",
    "in @xcite we discussed the distinction between internal and external approaches to computability over a structured set .",
    "the internally computable functions are defined from elements , relations and functions present in the structure , using acceptable operators that form new functions .",
    "the problem will be to decide what the acceptable operators are .",
    "the external concepts will be based on an already established definition of computability on a set of representatives . in our view , internal approaches are worthwhile pursuing .",
    "the advantage with an internal approach is on the one hand that one does not have to translate everything to the set of representatives , and on the other hand that an internally defined object will always be well defined . when there is a natural concept of external computability around , every internally computable function should also be externally computable , this is a soundness criterion .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a further discussion and for references .    in section [ sec2 ] we will prove that for computable banach spaces in general it is very hard to decide when three closed balls have a nonempty intersection .",
    "our precise statement is that the problem of when three closed balls have a nonempty intersection is not uniformly hyperarithmetical .",
    "we will use a computable version of a theorem due to r. kaufman @xcite , combined with a trick due to alfsen and effros @xcite , in order to establish this .",
    "the conclusion we draw is that when @xmath1 is a computable metric space and @xmath2 is a computable banach space , it is not hyperarithmetically decidable in general when a given finite approximation to a function @xmath3 also approximates a representation of a computable function from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . we see this as a support for introducing internal concepts of computability in analysis .",
    "the hyperarithmetical hierarchy , introduced by kleene , is a transfinite extension of the arithmetical hierarchy , see rogers @xcite or sacks @xcite for an introduction .",
    "the hyperarithmetical subsets of @xmath4 will be exactly the @xmath5-sets , and they may be considered to be the borel sets where the construction can be coded by a computable , well founded tree .    when a separable banach space @xmath2 is a closed subset of a metric space @xmath1 , then @xmath2 is actually a retract of @xmath1 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we will prove this , consider the proof as a case study and discuss on the basis of the proof why we might consider the retract as internally computable from the data at hand .",
    "the internal principle we will use can be seen as a combination of primitive recursion and forming effective limits .",
    "retracts at base types induce retracts at higher types .",
    "we use this to observe the effective version of the embedding theorem from @xcite : let @xmath6 be the universal separable metric space introduced by urysohn in @xcite . if @xmath7 is a type in base type variables @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a corresponding sequence of computable banach spaces , then there is a computable topological embedding of @xmath10 into @xmath11 . we will give a brief introduction to @xmath6 in section [ sec3 ] .    at the end of section [ sec3 ]",
    "we will discuss another scheme for internal algorithms , inspired by the @xmath12-operator , and we will show that every externally computable function from a computable metric space to a computable banach space will be internally computable in this extended sense .",
    "in this section we will consider banach spaces that are completions of countable normed vector spaces over @xmath13 , and the motivating problem is :    _ given three closed balls with known radiuses and centers , how hard is it to decide if they have a point in common ?",
    "_    we will make the question precise , and show that the problem is of analytic , but not of borel , complexity",
    ". an effective version will be that it is @xmath14 , but not hyperarithmetical . in the proof",
    "we have used an elaborated version of a construction due to alfsen and effros @xcite , see lemma [ ae ] .",
    "a computable metric space is given as the completion of a computable metric @xmath15 on an enumerated set @xmath16 .",
    "an object in a computable metric space is represented by functions @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "we say that the sequence represented by @xmath20 is _",
    "fast converging_. we will use @xmath20 , @xmath21 etc . for _ representing functions_. a function @xmath22 from one computable metric space @xmath1 to another space @xmath23 is _ externally computable _ if there is a computable partial functional @xmath24 that will be total on the set of functions representing elements in @xmath1 , and will map a function representing @xmath25 to a function representing @xmath26 .",
    "a _ computable banach space _ is primarily given as a computable metric space with computable @xmath27 and multiplication with scalars , respecting that the metric is given by a norm .",
    "these definitions are standard in the tte - approach to computational analysis , and the concepts are extensional ones .",
    "kaufman @xcite showed that whenever @xmath2 is a nonreflexive , separable banach space , then there is an equivalent norm on @xmath2 such that the set of bounded linear functionals attaining this norm is complete @xmath14 in the weak star topology .",
    "as stated , this is stronger than our theorem [ bo ] , and it can be used to prove that the collection of triples of closed balls having a nonempty intersection is complete analytical .",
    "we give an alternative proof for two reasons    1 .",
    "we need an effective version of the theorem for our applications and we find it simpler to give a direct proof for the special case we need than to analyze the computational content of kaufman s proof , even for the special cases given in his paper .",
    "our argument is quite different in flavor than that of kaufman , and we think that the method of proof is of interest in itself . in a sense ,",
    "our argument is more elementary , but then it leads to a definitely weaker result .    in this paper ,",
    "all banach spaces are real , and all linear functionals are real . following the tradition in set theory and theoretical computer science , we let the natural numbers @xmath28 start with @xmath29 .",
    "the problem under investigation is the following : given a real banach space @xmath2 via a norm on a dense , countable subspace @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is a vector space over @xmath13 , and given @xmath31 closed balls @xmath32 with centers in @xmath30 and radiuses in @xmath13 , how hard is it to tell if the intersection @xmath33 is empty or not .",
    "if @xmath34 or @xmath35 , this is trivial . we will show that we obtain the full complexity for @xmath36 .",
    "clearly the statement is analytic , or @xmath14 , since it is a simple statement of the existence of a point satisfying an arithmetical requirement .",
    "we will show that it is not borel , by showing that every borel subset of @xmath4 can be continuously reduced to this statement .",
    "in @xcite , alfsen and effros gave an example of a banach space @xmath2 with a subspace @xmath37 and three closed balls @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with radius 1 and centers in @xmath37 such that these balls do not intersect in @xmath37 but in @xmath2 .",
    "our first lemma is based on that example .",
    "[ ae ] let @xmath2 be a banach space with norm @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be a linear functional with norm 1 .",
    "we let @xmath43 be @xmath44 with the following norm : @xmath45 let @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the balls in @xmath43 with radius 1 and centers in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    1 .   @xmath49 .",
