    "in recent years the representation theory of the braid groups @xmath7 in @xmath1 strands has attracted attention due to two ground breaking developments . one of them is in the work of bigelow and krammer @xcite , who managed to resolve the long standing problem of the linearilty of the braid groups by showing that a two - parameter generalization of the classical burau representation is faithful .",
    "the second development is the emergence of vast families of braid group representations that are constructed from quantum algebras and conformal field theories .",
    "intriguing relationships between these seemingly very different approaches have been discovered and they remain a fascinating area of study .    in this article",
    "we give an explicit construction and proof of an isomorphism between the faithful representation @xmath8 of @xmath0 considered by bigelow and krammer and the submodule of the _ r - matrix _ representations on @xmath9 for the generic verma module @xmath10 of the quantum group @xmath11 .",
    "following @xcite we will refer in this article to @xmath8 as the _ lawrence - krammer - bigelow representation _ or lkb representation .",

    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are associated to deck transformations of a covering @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the two - point configuration space on a disc with @xmath1-punctures , and @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first obstacle in finding such an isomorphism is that the braid group representations obtained from quantum groups are originally defined over the complex numbers rather than integral two - variable laurent polynomials . to this end",
