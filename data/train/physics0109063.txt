    "symmetrical molecules exist in the form of nuclear spin isomers @xcite .",
    "most famous are the ortho and para isomers of h@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , spin isomers of molecules heavier than hydrogen",
    "are almost unknown .",
    "this is because their investigations were not possible for a long time due to the lack of enrichment methods .",
    "now such methods start to appear that has advanced the field significantly ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "yet one needs more efficient enrichment methods in order to perform investigations of spin isomers of various molecules .",
    "it will also stimulate practical applications of spin isomers .",
    "it was proposed recently to use strong electromagnetic fields for the spin isomer enrichment . in the first version of the method",
    "an enrichment is produced by the light - induced change of molecular level populations @xcite . in the second method enrichment",
    "is due to combined action of the light - induced level populations change , level energy shift and light - induced coherences @xcite .",
    "the latter allows to refer to this method as coherent control of spin isomers .",
    "analysis of the isomer coherent control @xcite was performed using simplified model of molecules interacting with a strong electromagnetic field .",
    "molecules were assumed to be at rest and have nondegenerate states .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop more general model which will account molecular center - of - mass motion .",
    "this can be essential because the process takes place in the gas phase at room temperature where light - molecular interaction is known to be affected by the molecular motion .",
    "coherent control of spin isomers has been analysed for the case of microwave excitation of molecular rotational transitions @xcite and for infrared excitation of rovibrational transitions @xcite .",
    "although each of these two schemes has some advantages we will account molecular motion only for the case of rovibrational excitation because this scheme allows to achieve larger enrichment .",
    "note also , that molecular motion is more important for infrared excitation than for microwave excitation because the latter has smaller doppler broadening .",
    "let us start with the qualitative description of the phenomenon .",
    "we assume that the molecules have two nuclear spin states , ortho and para .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the ch@xmath1f molecules @xcite .",
    "nuclear spin states are different by the symmetry of nuclear spin wave function of equivalent nuclei in the molecule",
    ". long wavelength electromagnetic radiation can not change the nuclear spin state directly .",
    "an important point is that the spin conversion in polyatomic molecules is governed by intramolecular mixing of close ( accidentally resonant ) ortho and para states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "interaction of an external radiation with these particular states can affect the spin conversion .",
    "the level scheme for rovibrational excitation is shown in fig .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that each of the two vibrational states ( ground and excited ) has one ortho - para level pair mixed by intramolecular perturbation .",
    "the infrared radiation excites the rovibrational transition @xmath2 of the ortho molecules . by assumption",
    ", collisions can not change spin state of the test molecules directly , i.e. , collisional cross - section of ortho - para transitions vanish .",
    "suppose that the molecule is placed initially in the ortho subspace of the ground vibrational state . due to collisions",
    "the test molecule will undergo fast rotational relaxation _ inside _ the ortho subspace .",
    "this will proceed until the molecule jumps to the state @xmath3 , which is mixed with the para state @xmath4 by the intramolecular perturbation @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , or to the state @xmath6 which is mixed with the para state @xmath7 by the combined action of the external field and intramolecular perturbation @xmath8 .",
    "admixture of a para state implies that the next collision can move the molecule to another para states and thus localize it inside the para subspace .",
    "the spin conversion occurs .",
    "vibrational relaxation in this enrichment scheme plays an important role .",
    "after ortho - para transition in upper vibrational state the molecule relaxes to the ground vibrational state . consequently there is no back conversion through the @xmath9 channel in excited vibrational state but back conversion occurs through the unperturbed @xmath10 channel .",
    "steady state concentrations of the spin isomers is determined by the ortho - to - para conversion rate in the excited vibrational state and the para - to - ortho conversion rate in the ground vibrational state .",
    "it is essential that conversion through the @xmath9 channel can be substantially enhanced by electromagnetic radiation .",
    "it is clear that molecular center - of - mass motion affects the phenomenon because it makes the ortho - para mixing in upper vibrational state velocity selective .",
    "one obvious effect is that the radiation does not interact with all molecules in the state @xmath6 .",
    "molecular motion influences also the level energy shift and coherences produced in the molecule by external radiation .",
    "one needs quantitative account of these effects in order to understand the real efficiency of the method .",
    "quantitative analysis of the problem can be performed with the help of kinetic equation for the density matrix , @xmath11 .",
    "the molecular hamiltonian consists of four terms , @xmath12 the main part , @xmath13 , has the eigen ortho and para states shown in fig .",
    "@xmath14 describes the molecular interactions with the external radiation that will be taken in the form of monochromatic travelling wave , @xmath15 where @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the amplitude , frequency and wave vector of the electromagnetic wave , respectively ; @xmath19 is the operator of the molecular electric dipole moment . @xmath8 and @xmath5 are the intramolecular perturbations that mix the ortho and para states in excited and ground vibrational states , respectively .",

    "the nuclear spin index is omitted in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) because there are no collisional ortho - para transitions and the kernels @xmath36 for ortho and para states are assumed to be the same .",
    "we will consider further the model of strong collisions with the following collision kernel , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the boltzmann distribution of rotational state populations , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rotational partition function for one vibrational state ; @xmath43 is the rotational energy ; @xmath44 is the gas temperature ; @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "consequently , this peak has rather large power broadening .",
    "the peak at @xmath131 in isomer enrichment was predicted in @xcite by considering only the level population effects .",
    "the `` off - resonant '' peak at @xmath140 appears because the external field splits the ortho state @xmath121 into two components and one sublevel crosses the para state @xmath7 at this frequency of the external field ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . at low @xmath129",
    "this peak is determined by @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath129 increases the peak at @xmath140 grows to much bigger values than the peak at @xmath131 . at high @xmath129 the main contribution to the @xmath140 peak comes from the rate @xmath128 .",

    "@xmath35 was taken equal 2  mhz .",
    "one can see , that strong optical field is able to convert almost all molecules to the para state if @xmath146 .",
    "thus relatively weak ( 3  khz ) coupling in upper state produces macroscopic effect , viz . , almost complete enrichment of spin isomers . in the case of much weaker coupling in upper state , enrichment is still significant .",
    "for example , if the perturbation in upper state , @xmath147  hz , one has the enrichment , @xmath148% .",
    "enrichment at this level can easily be measured .",
    "the enrichment peak at @xmath140 is narrow ( having almost the doppler width ) and thus can be distinguished from much wider structures ( the width @xmath149 ) caused by the @xmath131 peaks .",
    "conversion rate in the system is equal to @xmath102 , see eq .",
    "( [ overro ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to characterize it in relative units , @xmath150 thus , @xmath151 without an external field . at low @xmath129 , conversion rate , like enrichment , has two peaks in its frequency dependence .",
    "if rabi frequency , @xmath66 , is large and the ortho - para couplings in upper and low states have the same order of magnitude , conversion can be significantly enhanced ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , upper panel ) , although this enhancement is smaller than in the case of the molecules at rest @xcite .",
    "this enhancement appears because of the crossing of ortho and para states in upper vibrational state by external field .",
    "the main difference between the present case and ref .",
    "@xcite is that the peaks in conversion rate are much wider now having the doppler width , @xmath132 .",
    "we have developed the model of coherent control of nuclear spin isomers taking into account the molecular center - of - mass motion .",
    "this model is more realistic than the model @xcite in which the molecules were assumed to be at rest .",
    "it was shown that the main conclusions of @xcite still hold .",
    "one has two peaks in the enrichment and conversion rate dependences on the laser radiation frequency .",
    "one can achieve a substantial enrichment and speed up the conversion rate .",
    "it is also valid that this enrichment scheme can be used to access very weak perturbations in molecules . on the other hand",
    ", molecular motion causes some decrease in sensitivity of the method .",
    "for example , 1% enrichment can be achieved for the intramolecular perturbation equal @xmath152  hz in the present model , in comparison with 1% enrichment at @xmath153  hz in ref .",
    "this is not a significant difference .",
    "but even this loss in sensitivity can probably be avoided in special excitation scheme , e.g. , by using a multifrequency excitation instead of a monochromatic excitation .",
    "this needs further investigations .",
    "search of proper resonances will be one of the main difficulty in practical implementation of the proposed enrichment scheme .",
    "an existence of the off - resonance peak in the isomer enrichment has particular importance .",
    "first , one does not need to search for an exact coincidence of the ortho and para states in upper vibrational state .",
    "the energy gap can be compensated by detuning the laser frequency .",
    "second , the excitation in the off - resonant peak does produce even higher enrichment than in the resonant peak but does not produce significant population in upper vibrational state .",
    "the latter helps not to populate the excited vibrational state of other spin isomer and consequently suppress the spurious back conversion through the upper channel .",
