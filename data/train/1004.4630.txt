    "topological band insulators arise from nontrivial berry phase of electron wave functions and possess gapless boundary states as a consequence of topological properties of the bulk electron energy bands.@xcite topological invariants of electron wave functions in such topological insulators can be used to describe / identify two dimensional quantum spin hall insulators and three dimensional strong topological insulators .",
    "the presence of the gapless boundary states and the associated topological properties have recently been confirmed by a series of remarkable experiments on hgcdte , bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 , bi@xmath0se@xmath5 , bi@xmath0te@xmath5 , and other materials.@xcite it has been known that the strong spin - orbit coupling in these systems provides an essential ingredient for the nontrivial berry phase of electron wave functions .",
    "one important future direction is to understand the effect of interactions on the topological insulators .",
    "growing interests on combined effects of electron correlation and topological properties have naturally lead to recent fascinating studies on the realization of topological phases in transition metal oxides with @xmath6 electrons,@xcite instead of more conventional @xmath7 or @xmath8 orbital systems where electron correlation is less important .",
    "transition metal oxides with 5@xmath6 electrons are characterized by the strong spin - orbit coupling due to the large atomic number of 5@xmath6 transition metal elements . as a result ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling competes with the kinetic and interaction energies , leading to substantial correlation effects despite the relatively extended nature of the 5@xmath6 orbitals .",
    "this feature , for example , is confirmed by recent experiments on sr@xmath0iro@xmath9,@xcite where the spin - orbit coupling plays an essential role in the formation of the mott - insulator ground state . in the case of the so - called hyperkagome material na@xmath10ir@xmath11o@xmath12 ,",
    "a spin liquid ground state is proposed , manifesting strong correlation effects in 5@xmath6 electron systems .",
    "@xcite moreover iridium oxides are considered as promising candidate systems where we can study the interplay between electron correlation and strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "perhaps most interestingly , the iridium oxides may also be ideal materials for the occurrence of topological insulators .",
    "it is suggested that the honeycomb lattice of ir ions in na@xmath0iro@xmath5 with the complex hopping amplitudes arising from the strong spin - orbit coupling may lead to a quantum spin hall insulator.@xcite three dimensional pyrochlore lattice of ir is also suggested as a candidate system for a strong topological insulator .",

    "@xcite        in this work , we study the possibility and stability of strong topological insulators in pyrochlore iridates , a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = y or rare - earth elements ) by taking into account both of the strong spin - orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field effect induced by a local distortion of iro@xmath13 octahedra . due to the extended nature of 5@xmath6 electron wave functions ,",
    "the local crystal field strength in 5@xmath6 systems also becomes a large energy scale competing with electron interaction and spin - orbit coupling .",

    "given that there exist a variety of choices for the a - site , the pyrochlore iridates offer the opportunity to control the relative strength of the crystal field effect and the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in addition , the pyrochlore iridates show both metallic and insulating ground states at low temperatures as well as finite temperature metal - insulator transitions depending on the a - site ions .",
    "@xcite thus it would be very interesting to understand the origin of distinct phases and phase transitions .",
    "here we derive an effective hamiltonian for the ir ions in the pyrochlore iridates by carefully incorporating the trigonal crystal field effect and using the appropriate spin - orbital basis .",
    "previously an effective hamiltonian was derived by pesin and balents  @xcite for the ir ions in a perfect octahedral environment with the cubic @xmath14 symmetry and it was found that the ir pyrochlore system supports a strong topological insulator when the strength of spin - orbit coupling is sufficiently large .",
    "in contrast we find that the trigonal crystal field effect , which is always present in real pyrochlore systems , is quite significant and it can lead to a metallic ground state .    on the other hand , we find that the distortions of the ir pyrochlore lattice induced by softening of certain @xmath2=0 phonon modes give rise to the resurrection of strong topological insulators .",
    "this suggests that finite temperature metal - insuator transition can occur through structural distortions such that the low temperature ground state is a strong topological insulator .",
    "it is interesting to notice that recent experiments on sm@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 and eu@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 show structural changes at the metal - insulator transition even though the low temperature ground state seems to be magnetic and show spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "@xcite we also suggest from the studies of the electron - lattice coupling that applying pressure along [ 111 ] or its equivalent directions would be the most efficient way of generating strong topological insulators in pyrochlore iridates .",

    "<S> the possible existence of topological insulators in cubic pyrochlore iridates a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = y or rare - earth elements ) is investigated by taking into account the strong spin - orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the trigonal crystal field effect , which is always present in real systems , may destabilize the topological insulator proposed for the ideal cubic crystal field , leading to a metallic ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus the trigonal crystal field is an important control parameter for the metal - insulator changeover . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this could be one of the reasons why distinct low temperature ground states may arise for the pyrochlore iridates with different a - site ions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> examining the electron - lattice coupling , we find that softening of the @xmath2=0 modes corresponding to trigonal or tetragonal distortions of the ir pyrochlore lattice leads to the resurrection of the strong topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in principle , a finite temperature transition to a low - temperature topological insulator can occur via structural changes . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that the application of the external pressure along [ 111 ] or its equivalent directions would be the most efficient way of generating strong topological insulators in pyrochlore iridates . </S>"
