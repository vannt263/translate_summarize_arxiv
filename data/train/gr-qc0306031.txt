    "luigi bianchi studied the geometry of @xmath0-dimensional riemannian manifolds admitting isometries of simply transitive lie groups .",

    "the tensor of the structure constants @xmath1 @xmath2 of the real @xmath0-dimensional lie algebras can be split into a vector @xmath3 @xmath4 and a vector - free part @xmath5 @xmath6 \\epsilon_{jk\\ell}\\ ] ] which is a rank two tensor density .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath5 is symmetric since @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the completely skew - symmetric levi - civit symbol with @xmath9 and we do not distinguish between contra- and covariant indices because we classify with the orthogonal group in the lie algebra .",
    "we want to show in the following that the vector - free bianchi types exhibit a simple relation between group and curvature properties that can be exhibited in a simple diagram . for diagrams of the bianchi types",

    "they can be developed in terms of the solder forms @xmath15 giving @xmath16 the @xmath17 were introduced by giorgio ricci curbastro and are named after him the ricci coefficients .",
    "the maurer - cartan equations for the left - invariant differential forms @xmath11 are given by @xmath18 where @xmath1 are the structure constants of the simply transitive group of isometries .",
    "we have from and @xmath19 and obtain now , by comparison with @xmath20 this means that the structure constants are obtained as twice the skew - symmetric part of the ricci coefficients with respect to their last two indices .",
    "writing the last equation @xmath0 times cyclically we obtain @xmath21 since the structure constants are constant , i.e. , position - independent , it follows that the ricci coefficients for the bianchi spaces are also constant . as we shall see , it is the ricci coefficients which are the parameters of choice .",
    "the jacobi identities for the structure constants @xmath1 read @xmath22 contracting the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 we get the identities @xcite @xmath25",
    "the curvature @xmath26-form @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 the identities @xmath29 give then the equivalent of the jacobi identities for the structure constants of the lie algebra .",
    "the orthonormal components of the riemann tensor are given by @xmath30 in terms of the constant ricci coefficients we obtain from and @xmath31 we have thus @xmath32 this gives for the ricci tensor @xmath33 the second term cancels the fourth term and we obtain @xmath34 we decompose now the ricci coefficients in the same way as we did for the structure constants .",
    "we define the vector @xmath35 by @xmath36 and obtain from @xmath37 we notice that the expression for the ricci tensor becomes particularly simple if the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath38 vanish .",

    "in the following we shall specialize to the vector - free case @xmath47 george ellis and malcolm maccallum referred to these @xmath0-dimensional real lie algebras as `` class a '' @xcite .",
    "maccallum calls them also unimodular algebras @xcite . in this case",
    "the relation between the matrix of the ricci coefficients and the matrix of the ricci tensor becomes particularly simple .",
    "specializing with we obtain @xmath48 introducing the matrices @xmath49 we have for @xmath50 @xmath51 using orthogonal transformations to diagonalize the matrix @xmath52 we have with @xmath53 for the ricci tensor @xmath54 the @xmath55 are real numbers . under similarity transformations of the differential forms",
    "@xmath56 ( consisting of rotations , reflections and multiplications with a positive number ) the matrix @xmath52 of the ricci coefficients can be classified according to the relative signs of its diagonal elements .",
    "we have the following @xmath57 possibilities @xmath58 since @xmath52 is a tensor density and not a tensor the sign of its signature is not invariant under the similarity transformations of the metric .",
    "this classification gives also a classification of the bianchi spaces since the eigenvalues of the ricci tensor are invariants .",
    "the cases a through e are distinct .",
    "it is remarkable that the combinations @xmath59 , @xmath60 and its permutations , and the possibilities c and d can not occur for the ricci tensor .",
    "cases f and e describe both the flat euclidean @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "we show the classifications in figure 1 .",

    "thus we get a disk in uniform shade , either white or grey , with divisions .",
    "topologically , can be viewed as a transformation from a sphere to the interiors of the divisions of a disk .",
    "the boundary of the disc corresponds to @xmath61 which is invariant under similarity transformations.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the vector - free bianchi spaces and their ricci coefficients depend on two real parameters under similarity transformations of the differential forms @xmath56 .",
    "this is plausible since the matrix @xmath52 has six parameters and the similarity group has fo ur .",
    "we thought it would be nice if one had a plane diagram that shows the relation of the different types of the ricci coefficients and ricci tensors . instead of a diagram for",
    "the matrix @xmath52 one could consider one for the homogeneous quadratic polynomial @xmath62 together with the polynomial @xmath63 which is invariant under similarity transformations .",
    "the construction of a plane diagram for the vector - free case can be easily described using the concepts and terms of projective geometry . however , since physicists tend not to be conversant with them we use @xmath0-dimensional vector algebra remarking that the points of the projective plane are nothing else but the rays originating from the origin of a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "a ray is defined here as all positive and negative , but not zero , multiples of a non - zero vector .",
    "topologically the projective plane is identical with the unit sphere on which opposite points have been identified .",
    "a conic , like the one defined by , can not be mapped as a set of rays since it allows no real solutions .",
    "we interpret a symmetric matrix @xmath64 with non - vanishing determinant up to a factor @xmath65 as giving rise to the bilinear form @xmath66 to each ray @xmath67 belongs a covector @xmath68 up to a non - vanishing factor .",
    "we have then @xmath69 the equation of a plane of rays through the origin for the fixed ray @xmath67 .",
    "we apply this construction to the equation with @xmath70 and have the result that the plane is orthogonal to the ray .",
    "thus the ray @xmath71 gives rise to the plane @xmath72 which is the @xmath73@xmath74 plane . in this way we obtain from the @xmath0 rays along the coordinate axes the @xmath0",
    "coordinate planes orthogonal to them .",
    "finally , we take a fourth ray not in the coordinate planes .",
    "we choose @xmath75 it gives rise to a plane through the origin with equation @xmath76 we turn now to our quadratic polynomial which characterizes the ricci coefficients .",
    "since is definite we can assume it to be in diagonal form @xmath77 where @xmath55 are real and determined up to a common , non - vanishing factor .",
    "we exclude the case that all @xmath0 @xmath55 vanish .",
    "the ray@xmath78 thus gives rise to the plane @xmath79 the intersection of this plane with the coordinate planes gives rise to the @xmath0 rays @xmath80",
    "since each ray determines uniquely the plane the classification of the ricci coefficients is that of the rays alone . each ray can be identified with a pair of opposite points on the unit sphere , equivalent to a point on the real projective plane .",
    "the map from the ricci coefficients to the ricci tensor given by equations and is not a map from rays into rays since the ricci tensor remains invariant under space - reflection . to turn our map into an invertible one from the projective plane @xmath81 of the ricci coefficient types to the ricci tensor types we construct a real analog of a riemann surface for the ricci tensor types by extending the ricci tensor into the ricci tensor volume @xmath82 .",
    "this results now in the ray map @xmath83 from the projective plane @xmath81 into the projective plane @xmath84 .",
    "as long as all @xmath85 are different from zero the map is one - to - one and invertible .",
    "it creates a correspondence between rays not lying in the coordinate planes .",
    "this correspondence , well known to algebraic geometers as a cremona transformation , can be extended into a birational correspondence from @xmath81 to @xmath84 @xcite .",

    "the graph shows the transformation of the coordinate planes .",
    "the rays @xmath87 which are intersections of the coordinate planes in @xmath81 blow up to the coordinate planes @xmath88 in @xmath84 with @xmath89 while the coordinate planes @xmath90 in @xmath81 blow down to the intersections of coordinate planes @xmath91 in @xmath84.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the rays @xmath85 and @xmath92 are subject to the equations @xmath93 if @xmath94 then at least one of the @xmath92 is different from zero and thus all @xmath92 are and we have @xmath95 if @xmath96 , @xmath97 it follows that @xmath98 this shows that a coordinate plane without its axes corresponds to the coordinate axis orthogonal to the plane .    finally , if @xmath99 we have @xmath100 to each coordinate axis corresponds the plane orthogonal to it",
    ".    figure @xmath0 . in the next section",
    "will show the correspondence .",
    "to obtain a diagram of the projective plane we use a gnomic projection of the rays through the origin to the plane @xmath101 this means that we normalize the @xmath55 by introducing the @xmath102 @xmath103 we interpret then the @xmath102 as triangular coordinates .",
    "the planes @xmath104 become now the sides of an equilateral triangle of height @xmath105 and the @xmath106 measure the distances from the side @xmath107 .",
    "the coordinates are counted positive towards the interior of the triangle .",
    "see figure @xmath0 .",
    "a simple construction for the lines is given by coxeter @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the triangular coordinates are preferred here since they reflect the symmetry of the classification under permutation of the @xmath0 eigenvalues @xmath55 .",
    "however , we have to admit also values of the @xmath102 on the line at infinity since @xmath108 is allowed to vanish .",
