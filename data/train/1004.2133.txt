    "stopping a stochastic process @xmath0 as close as possible to its ultimate supremum @xmath28 is an objective of both practical and theoretical interest . speaking in general terms , the optimal prediction problem can be formulated as follows @xmath29 where the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath5 of @xmath6 , and @xmath30 is a  distance / error function [ e.g. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a parameter quantifying the error ] .",
    "variants of these problems have been studied in the past mostly in discrete time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the case of continuous time has been studied in the recent papers @xcite and @xcite when  @xmath6 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "this study was extended in  @xcite to the case of brownian motion with drift .",
    "it was observed there that the existence of a  nonzero drift leads to optimal stopping boundaries having a complex structure which in some cases appears to be counter - intuitive . for other optimal prediction problems studied to date",
    ", we refer to @xcite ( see also  @xcite , chapter viii ) . in these problems",
    ", it is assumed that the underlying process has continuous sample paths .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to initiate a study of the optimal prediction problems for processes with jumps in continuous time , and to examine the extent to which the jump structure influences the resulting optimal stopping boundaries . to stay close to the more familiar case of brownian motion , we study the case when @xmath6 is a stable lvy process of index @xmath1 , and to focus on one particular aspect of the jump structure we consider the case when @xmath6 jumps upward only ( i.e. , when @xmath6 has no negative jumps ) .",
    "it turns out that already these hypotheses lead to a complicated optimal prediction problem , which apart from initial similarities with the case of brownian motion ( through the scaling property and deterministic time - change arguments ) requires novel arguments to be developed in order to find a solution .",
    "these complications are primarily attributed to the underlying jump structure which leads to the relatively unexplored avenue of integro - differential equations ( fractional calculus ) instead of more familiar differential equations .",
    "yet another difficulty ( that the law of @xmath33 was not available in the literature prior to the present study ) is now overcome by the accompanying paper @xcite , and the knowledge of this law plays a key role in our treatment of the optimal prediction problem below .",
    "our main findings ( theorem [ theo11 ] ) can be summarized as follows .",
    "given a stable lvy process @xmath0 of index @xmath34 with no negative jumps , and letting @xmath35 denote its running supremum for @xmath36 $ ] , we consider the optimal prediction problem @xmath37 where the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath5 of @xmath6 , and the error parameter @xmath7 is given and fixed ( we will see in section [ sec2 ] below why the restriction to this interval is natural ) .",
    "reducing the optimal prediction problem to a fractional free - boundary problem of riemann  liouville type , and finding an explicit solution to the latter , we show that there exists @xmath8 ( equal to @xmath9 approximately ) and a strictly increasing function @xmath10 satisfying @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath14 such that for every @xmath40 and @xmath16 the following stopping time is optimal @xmath41 \\dvtx s_t { -}x_t \\ge z _ * ( t { -}t)^{1/\\alpha } \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the unique root to a transcendental equation ( with parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this extends the analogous results for a standard brownian motion @xmath6 derived in @xcite and @xcite when @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "moreover , if either @xmath21 or @xmath44 then it is not optimal to stop at @xmath45 when @xmath24 is sufficiently large .",
    "the existence of the breakdown points @xmath25 and @xmath26 stands in sharp contrast with the brownian motion case ( formally corresponding to @xmath27 ) , and the phenomenon itself may be attributed to the interplay between the jump structure ( admitting a transition from lighter to heavier tails ) and the individual preferences ( represented by the error parameter @xmath20 ) . in particular , recalling that the index @xmath19 quantifies the heaviness of the upward tails of the process @xmath6 , we see that the result may be broadly interpreted as follows : _ the heavier the upward tails the larger the optimal stopping time_. while this conclusion is close to naive intuition , and the interpretation itself may also be extended to account for the individual preferences , the fact that the solution method can detect the breakdown points exactly appears to be of considerable practical and theoretical interest .",
    "other interesting features of the problem include the remarkable probabilistic representation of the solution to the it / riemann  liouville / caputo free - boundary problem that is novel in the case of brownian motion as well .",
    "\\1 . let @xmath46 be a stable lvy process of index @xmath1 whose characteristic function is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the supremum process of  @xmath6 , that is , @xmath52 for @xmath49 .",
    "consider the optimal prediction problem @xmath53 where the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath5 of @xmath6 [ i.e. , stopping times with respect to the natural filtration @xmath54 generated by @xmath6 for @xmath55 .",
    "it is assumed in ( [ 2.3 ] ) that the error parameter @xmath56 and the terminal time @xmath57 are given and fixed ( we will see below that there is no restriction in assuming that @xmath58 ) .",
    "the following properties of @xmath6 are readily deduced from ( [ 2.1 ] ) using standard means ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) : the law of @xmath59 is the same as the law of @xmath60 for each @xmath61 given and fixed ( scaling property ) ; @xmath6 is a martingale with @xmath62 for all @xmath49 ; @xmath6 jumps upward ( only ) and creeps downward [ in the sense that @xmath63 for @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the first entry time of @xmath6 into @xmath66 ; @xmath6 has sample paths of unbounded variation ; @xmath6 oscillates from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( in the sense that @xmath69 and @xmath70 both a.s . ) ; the starting point @xmath71 of @xmath6 is regular [ for both @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note also that the lvy measure @xmath74 of @xmath6 equals @xmath75 on the borel @xmath76-algebra of @xmath77 .",
    "setting , for example , @xmath78 we see from ( [ 2.1 ] ) that @xmath79 @xmath80 converges in law to a standard brownian motion @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "we moreover see from ( [ 2.4 ] ) that when @xmath19 is closer to @xmath83 then the ( upward ) jumps of @xmath6 have lighter tails , and when @xmath19 is closer to @xmath84 then the ( upward ) jumps of @xmath6 have heavier tails .",
    "thus , in many ways , the process @xmath6 resembles a standard brownian motion @xmath81 , however , the existence of ( upward ) jumps of @xmath6 represents a notable exception .",
    "note also that @xmath85 is not equal in law to @xmath86 for fixed @xmath87 unlike in the case of @xmath81 .",
    "the error parameter @xmath20 in the problem ( [ 2.3 ] ) is assumed to belong to @xmath88 for two reasons .",
    "first , it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite , page 159 ) that for a lvy process @xmath89 and a number @xmath32 given and fixed , the following three facts are equivalent : ( i )  @xmath90 for some / all @xmath87 ; ( ii )  @xmath91 for some / all @xmath87 ; ( iii )  @xmath92 . in the case of our process",
    "@xmath6 when @xmath74 is given by ( [ 2.4 ] ) above , it is easily seen that ( iii )  holds [ and thus both expected values in ( i ) and ( ii ) are finite ] if and only if @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , the latter condition then also implies that the value @xmath94 in ( [ 2.3 ] ) is finite .",
    "second , if @xmath95 then the optimal prediction problem ( [ 2.3 ] ) is trivial since @xmath96 for every ( bounded ) stopping time @xmath5 of @xmath6 due to the martingale property of @xmath6 .",
    "hence , @xmath7 represents a natural assumption on the error parameter .",
    "note that there is no loss of generality if we assume that @xmath58 in the problem ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we set @xmath97 to indicate dependence on @xmath57 in ( [ 2.3 ] ) , then by the scaling property of @xmath6 we see that @xmath98 and there is a simple one - to - one correspondence between the stopping times @xmath5 in the problem @xmath99 and the stopping times @xmath76 in the problem @xmath100 ( obtained by setting @xmath101 ) . for this reason , we will often assume in the sequel that the horizon @xmath102 in ( [ 2.3 ] ) equals @xmath84 .",
    "_ projecting future onto present_. one of the key initial difficulties in the optimal prediction problem ( [ 2.3 ] ) is that the expression after the expectation sign contains the random variable @xmath33 and as such depends on the ( ultimate ) future of the process @xmath6 that is unknown at the present ( stopping ) time @xmath103 . in our first step therefore ( similarly to @xcite and @xcite ) , we will project the future states of @xmath6 onto the present / past states of @xmath6 by conditioning with respect to @xmath104 and exploiting stationary / independent increments of @xmath6 .",
    "as already mentioned above , we may and do assume that @xmath58 in the sequel .    to this end , note that we have @xmath105 since @xmath106 is independent from @xmath107 and @xmath24 is @xmath107-measurable .",

    "using the fact that each stopping time @xmath5 of @xmath6 is the limit of a  decreasing sequence of discrete stopping times @xmath112 of @xmath6 as @xmath113 , it is easily verified using hunt s lemma ( see , e.g. , @xcite , page 236 ) that ( [ 2.7 ] ) extends as follows @xmath114 for all stopping times @xmath5 of @xmath6 with values in @xmath115 $ ] . setting @xmath116 for @xmath49",

    "taking @xmath120 on both sides in ( [ 2.8 ] ) and using the notation ( [ 2.9 ] ) , we see that the optimal prediction problem ( [ 2.3 ] ) reduces to the optimal stopping problem @xmath121 where the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",

    "\\5 . _ deterministic time change_. motivated by the form of the function @xmath124 in  ( [ 2.6 ] ) , we now introduce the deterministic time change @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the `` old '' time and @xmath127 is a `` new '' time .",
    "note that @xmath128 is a stopping time with respect to @xmath118 if and only if @xmath129 is a stopping time with respect to @xmath130 .",
