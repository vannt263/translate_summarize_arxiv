    "the star formation activity and other fundamental galaxy properties such as morphology and gas content vary systematically with redshift , galaxy mass and environment .",
    "while redshifts and galaxy masses are at least conceptually clearly defined , the definition of a galaxy environment is arbitrary and its optimal choice would require an a priori knowledge of the very thing we are trying to identify , that is the physical environmental driver or drivers of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "most studies nowadays define the `` environment '' either in terms of the local galaxy number density ( the number of galaxies per unit volume or projected area around the galaxy of interest ) , or the virial mass of the cluster or group to which the galaxy belongs , when this applies , because these are the two most easily measurable quantities from spectroscopic or even imaging surveys .    in spite of environment being an elusive and arbitrary concept ,",
    "the fact that galaxy properties depend on environment was recognized earlier than the dependence on galaxy mass and redshift ( hubble & humason 1931 ) .",
    "the first quantitative measurement of systematic differences with local environment was the so - called morphology - density relation ( mdr ) in nearby clusters .",
    "the mdr is the observed variation of the proportion of different hubble types with local density , with ellipticals being more common in high - density regions , spirals being more common in low - density regions , and s0s making up a constant fraction of the total population within the cluster virial radius regardless of density ( dressler 1980 , as revisited in dressler et al .",
    "it was subsequently found that a similar mdr also exists in nearby groups ( postman & geller 1984 also revisited in postman et al .",
    "2005 ) and that a qualitatively similar , but quantitatively different , mdr is present in galaxy clusters at redshifts up to 1 ( dressler et al .",

    "galaxy stellar populations have also long been known to vary systematically with environment ( spitzer & baade 1951 ) : denser environments have on average older stellar populations . at least at some level",
    ", this must be related to the higher incidence of early - type galaxies in high density regions , i.e. to the morphology - density relation . at low redshift the best characterization of the `` star formation - local density '' ( sfd )",
    "relation has come from large redshift surveys .",
    "these studies have conclusively demonstrated that the average galaxy properties related to star formation depend on local density even at large clustercentric radii ; at low densities in clusters ; and outside of clusters , in groups and the general field ( hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 , lewis et al .",

    "2004 , see also pimbblet et al .",
    "moreover , they have highlighted the dependence on both galaxy mass and local environment , showing strong environmental trends at a given galaxy mass ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 , baldry et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to understand the origin of the sfd relation , it is essential to answer two separate questions : at any given galaxy mass , 1 ) how does the proportion of star - forming galaxies vary with density , and 2 ) how does the star formation activity in star - forming galaxies vary with density ? at low - z ,",
    "the evidence for a change in the relative numbers of red / passively - evolving and blue / star - forming galaxies with local environment is overwhelming , but it remains an open question whether star - forming galaxies of similar mass have star formation histories that depend on local density ( balogh et al . 2004a , b , hogg et al .",
    "2004 , gomez et al .",
    "2003 , baldry et al . 2006 ) .",
    "deep redshift surveys have recently extended the study of the sfd relation in the general field to high redshift .",
    "they have revealed that the number ratio of red to blue galaxies increases with local density out to @xmath4 and that we might be witnessing the establishment of the color - density relation at @xmath5 approaching 1.5 ( cucciati et al .",
    "2006 , cooper et al .",
    "2007 , cassata et al .",
    "this suggests that the transition from a star - forming phase to a passive one occurs for a large number of massive galaxies in groups at @xmath6 ( poggianti et al .",
    "in apparent but not substantial contradiction , the average sfr per galaxy at @xmath7 increases instead of decreasing with local density . therefore the sfd relation is inverted with respect to the local universe ( elbaz et al .",
    "2007 , cooper et al . 2008 ) .",
    "thus , the mdr up to @xmath7 is well studied in clusters and has started to be explored in the field ( capak et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the sfd relation is now being investigated in the general field over a similar redshift baseline . in clusters , moran et al .",

    ", a detailed study of the relation between star - formation and local environment in distant clusters has not yet been carried out . as a consequence , a comparison of the mdr and the sfd relation has not been possible to date in clusters at high redshift .",
    "this is due to the limited number of well - studied distant clusters with homogeneous data .",

    "groups are therefore the meeting point of field and cluster studies at high - z , and it has become possible to study the dependence of the sfd relation on global environment ( clusters , groups and the field ) , approaching the question from both perspectives .    in this paper , we investigate the relation between star formation activity , morphology and local galaxy density in @xmath0 clusters and groups observed by the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) . the ediscs data set permits an internal comparison with galaxies in poor groups and the field at the same redshifts in a homogeneous way .",

    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy can be roughly estimated from the [ oii ] line flux in its integrated spectrum .",

    "however , data for larger galaxy samples will be needed to confirm this result .",
    "from the ew([oii])-density relation one would conclude that on average the star formation activity in currently star - forming galaxies is invariant with both local and global environment , while from the sfr - density relation one may conclude that the star formation rate is possibly boosted by the impact with the cluster outskirts , as several studies have suggested ( see e.g. milvang - jensen et al .",

    "[ sfroii ] .    to summarize , in distant clusters",
    "we have observed a weak anticorrelation between sfr / m and cluster mass , the lack of any correlation between cluster - integrated sfr and mass , and the presence of a correlation between sfr / m and star - forming fraction .",
    "these findings can be explained , and actually predicted , on the basis of three observed quantities : a ) the constancy of the average sfr per star - forming galaxy in all clusters , found in this paper ( left panel of fig .",

    "observation ( a ) , that the average sfr per star - forming galaxy is constant for clusters of all masses , suggests that either clusters of all masses affect the star formation activity in infalling star - forming galaxies in the same way , or that , if / when they cause a truncation of the star formation , they do so on a very short timescale . in the latter case ,",
    "star - forming galaxies of a given mass have similar properties inside and outside of clusters . observation ( b ) , the correlation between cluster mass and number of cluster members , stems from the mass and galaxy accretion history of clusters .",
    "these results can be used to test the predictions of simulations .",
    "more importantly , comparisons with simulations can allow to explore how our results are linked with the growth history of clusters , which should play an important role in establishing the star - forming fraction .",
    "the relative numbers of star - forming versus non - star - forming galaxies ( observation ( c ) above ) and , above all , its evolution , remain the key observations that display a strong dependence on cluster mass . ultimately , understanding the observed trends comes down to finding out why the relative proportion of passive and star - forming galaxies varies with ",
    "environment , the latter being either cluster mass or local density . in poggianti",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) we proposed a schematic scenario in which there are two channels that cause a galaxy to be passive in clusters today : one due to the mass of the galaxy host halo at @xmath135 ( a `` primordial '' effect ) , and one due to the effects related to the infall into a massive structure ( a `` quenching '' mechanism ) .",
    "the results of this paper are consistent with that simple picture .",
    "for 10 ediscs fields we can study galaxy morphologies from visual classifications of hst / acs images ( desai et al .",
    "2007 ) and thus compare our star formation estimates with galaxy hubble types . in particular , we are interested in knowing whether the trend of sf with local density can be partially or fully ascribed to the existence of a morphology - density relation ( mdr ) . do the sf trends simply reflect a different morphological mix at different densities , with the sf properties of each hubble type being invariant with local density ? or do the sf properties of a given morphological type depend on density ? can the lower average sf activity in denser regions be fully explained by the higher proportion of early - type galaxies in denser regions ?",
    "desai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have published visual classifications in the form of hubble types ( e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , sd , sm , irr ) . however , for this paper we consider only four broad morphological classes : e ( ellipticals ) , s0s ( lenticulars ) , early - spirals ( sa s and sb s ) and late - spirals ( sc s and later types ) .",
    "we note that irregular galaxies ( irr ) represent only 10% of our late - spiral class and therefore do not dominate any of the late - spiral results we present below .",
    "the morphology - density relation for ediscs spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members brighter than @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "we find clear trends similar to what has been observed before in clusters both at high- and low - z ( dressler et al .",

    "previous high - z studies have not considered early - spirals and late - spirals separately .",
    "we find that the spiral trend is due to the fraction of late - spirals strongly decreasing with density , while the distribution of early - spirals is rather flat with density ( top panel of fig .",
    "the early - spiral density distribution is thus very similar to that of s0 galaxies , suggesting that these objects are the best candidates for the immediate progenitors of the s0 population , which has been observed to grow between @xmath136 and @xmath81 ( dressler et al .",

    "we consider three observables related to the star formation activity : the [ oii ] ew and the sfr derived from the [ oii ] flux described in the previous sections , and the break at 4000  . the last is defined as the difference in the level of the continuum just bluer and just redder than 4000  .",
    "it can be thought of as a `` color '' and in fact it usually correlates well with broad band optical colors , though it spans a smaller wavelength range than broad bands and is thus less sensitive to the dust obscuring those stars that dominate the spectrum at these wavelengths .",
    "we use the narrow version of this index , sometimes known as @xmath137 , as defined by balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and refer to it as d4000 in the following .",

    "the same figure presents the local density distribution of each morphological class .",

    "two main conclusions can be drawn from this figure :    \\a ) neither the sfr , nor the ew(oii ) , nor the d4000 distributions of each given morphological class vary systematically with local density . dividing each morphological class into two equally - populated density bins , we find statistically consistent mean and median values of sfr , ew([oii ] ) , and d4000 .",
    "the only exception may be a possible deficiency of galaxies with high sfr among early spirals at the highest densities .",
    "however , the mean and median sfr in the two density bins differ only at the 1@xmath31 level .",
    "thus , as far as it can be measured in our relatively small sample of galaxies , the sf properties of a given morphological class do not depend on density .",
    "\\b ) while the great majority of es and s0s are `` red '' ( = = have high values of d4000 , and null values of ew(oii ) and sfr ) and the great majority of late - type spirals are `` blue '' ( = = have low d4000 values , oii in emission and ongoing sf ) , early - spirals are a clearly bimodal population composed of a red subgroup ( @xmath138 ) and a blue subgroup ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "approximately 40% of the early - spirals are red with absorption - line spectra and 40% are blue with emission - line spectra , and the rest have intermediate colors .",
    "most of the intermediate - color galaxies have some emission , but at least two out of 10 have recently stopped forming stars ( have k+a post - starburst spectra ; poggianti et al .",
    "2008 in prep . ) and therefore are observed in the transition phase while moving from the blue to the red group . for their star - formation properties ,",
    "the red early - spirals can be assimilated to the `` passive spirals '' observed in several previous surveys ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 , moran et al .",
    "2006 , goto et al . 2003 , moran et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the early - spiral bimodality is not due to the red subgroup being composed mainly of sa s and the blue subgroup consisting mainly of sb s , as the proportion of sa s and sb s is similar in the two subgroups .",
    "interestingly , the relative fractions of `` red '' and `` blue '' early - spirals does not strongly depend on density , as might have been expected , but there is a tendency for the intermediate color galaxies to be in regions of high projected local density .",
    "we now want to calculate whether the observed star formation - density relations can be accounted for by the observed morphology - density relation , combined with the average sf properties of each morphological class .    to obtain the trend of star - forming fraction with density expected from the mdr , we compute the fraction of star - forming galaxies in each morphological class and combine this with the fraction of each morphological class in each density bin ( i.e. the mdr ) .",
    "the result is compared with the observed star - forming fractions in fig .",
    "[ mainmorph ] .    similarly , to compute the expected sfr - density relation given the md - relation ,",
    "we combine the mean sfr in solar masses per year for each morphological class ( 0.23@xmath720.1 for es , 0.15@xmath720.1 for s0s , 1.03@xmath720.16 for early - spirals and 2.71@xmath720.43 for late spirals ) with the fraction of each morphological class in each density bin ( i.e. the mdr ) , and compare it with the observed sfr - density relation in fig .",

    "this figure shows that the mdr is able to fully account for the observed trends of star - forming fraction and sfr with density ( and viceversa ) .",
    "hence , we find that the md relation and the `` star formation - density relation '' ( in the different ways it can be observed ) are equivalent .",
    "these observations indicate that at least in clusters , for the densities , redshifts , galaxy magnitudes , sf and morphology indicators probed in this study , these are simply two independent ways of observing the same phenomenon , and that neither of the two relations is more `` fundamental '' than the other .",
    "the equivalence between the sfd and the md relations that we find in ediscs clusters is at odds with a number of studies at low redshift . in local clusters ,",

    "more recently , a series of works on other field low - z redshift surveys have concluded that the star formation - density relation is the strongest correlation of galaxy properties with local density , suggesting that the most fundamental relation with environment is the one with star formation histories , not with galaxy structure ( kauffmann et al .",

    "visual morphologies such as those we use in this paper are known to be related both to structural parameters and star formation . in fact , from a field sdss galaxy sample at low - z , van der wel ( 2008 ) concludes that structure mainly depends on galaxy mass and morphology depends primarily on environment , and that the md relation at low - z is `` intrinsic and not just due to a combination of more fundamental , underlying relations '' .",
    "similarly , park et al . ( 2007 ) argue that the strongest dependence on local density is that of morphology , when morphology is defined by a combination of concentration index , color and color gradients .",
    "interestingly , having fixed morphology and luminosity , these authors find that both concentration _ and _ star formation related observables are nearly independent of local density .",

    "figure [ wolf ] shows that we find an `` md - relation '' at fixed age , i.e. a difference in mean density for galaxies of the same age but different morphological type , for example between old es and old s0s .    since age trends with density are observed only at faint magnitudes by wolf et al . , the fact that their galaxy magnitude limit is 2 mag deeper than ours may partly or fully explain the discordant conclusions .",
    "the sfd and the md relations may be equivalent at bright magnitudes , and decoupled at faint magnitudes .    additionally , it is possible that we are observing an evolutionary effect , with star formation and morphology equally depending on density at high - z , but not at low - z",
    ". this might be the case if at high - z most galaxies still retain the morphological class they had `` imprinted '' in the very early stages of their formation , and if at lower redshifts progressively larger number of galaxies are transformed , having their star formation activity and morphology changed .",
    "such transformations are known to have occurred in a significant fraction of local cluster galaxies .",
    "in fact , approximately 60% of today s galaxies have evolved from star - forming at @xmath141 to passive at @xmath81 according to the results of poggianti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "if the changes in star formation are more closely linked with the local environment than the related change in morphology , while the latter retains some memory of the initial structure at very high - z ( mostly dependent on galaxy mass ) , a progressive decoupling between the sfd and the md relations would take place at lower redshifts ( see also capak et al .",

    ", the differences between our analysis and wolf s results would be both an evolutionary and a galaxy magnitude limit effect , the two being closely linked . at low - z it should now be possible to fully address these questions and investigate the galaxy magnitude and global environment dependence of the sfd - md decoupling .",
    "ours is so far the only study comparing the sfd and the md relations at high redshift , so other future works may help clarify the redshift evolution of the link between the two relations in clusters , groups , and the field .",

    "the significance of this peak ranges between 1 and 4 @xmath31 depending on the method of analysis .",
    "this result could be related to the recent findings of an inverted , possibly peaked sfr - density relation in the field at @xmath7 .    the ew - density and the sfr - density relations thus provide different views of the correlation between star formation activity and environment .",

    "we find no evidence for a correlation with cluster mass .",
    "in contrast , the cluster sfr per unit of cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with the star - forming fraction , although we caution that the anticorrelation with mass could be mainly driven by correlated errors .",
    "the average star - forming galaxy happens to form about one solar mass per year ( uncorrected for dust ) in all of our clusters , making the integrated star formation rate in distant clusters just equal to the number of star - forming galaxies .",
    "these findings can be understood in the light of three additional results that we show : a ) the cluster integrated sfr is linearly proportional ( equal ) to the number of star - forming galaxies ; b ) the total number of cluster members scales with cluster mass as @xmath142 and c ) the star - forming fraction depends on cluster mass in distant clusters as presented in poggianti et al .",
    "given the invariance of the average star formation with cluster mass , as well as with global and local environment ( see points 1 and 4 above ) , the most important thing that remains to be explained is the cause of the cluster - mass - dependent evolution of the relative number of star - forming versus non - star - forming galaxies .",
    "\\6 ) defining galaxy morphologies as visually classified hubble types from hst / acs images , we find a morphology - density relation similar to that observed in previous distant cluster studies .",

    "the bimodality of the early spirals , together with their resemblance to s0s as far as the morphology - density distribution is concerned , once more suggests that early spirals are the most promising candidates for the progenitors of a significant fraction of the s0 population in clusters today ( see also moran et al .",

    "this is at odds with recent results at low - z . among the possible reasons for the discordant conclusions",

    "<S> we investigate how the [ oii ] properties and the morphologies of galaxies in clusters and groups at @xmath0 depend on projected local galaxy density . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results with those derived from the field at similar redshifts and from clusters at low - z . </S>",
    "<S> in both nearby and distant clusters , higher - density regions contain proportionally fewer star - forming galaxies . at odds with low - z results , </S>",
    "<S> the relation between star - forming fraction and local density at high - z varies from high- to low - mass clusters , although is not solely a function of cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> both at high- and low - z , the average [ oii ] equivalent width ( ew ) of star - forming galaxies is independent of local density . </S>",
    "<S> however , in distant clusters the average current star formation rate in star - forming galaxies seems to peak at densities @xmath1 galaxies mpc@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> when using galaxy samples with similar mass distributions , we do not find large variations in the average ew(oii ) and sfr properties of star - forming galaxies in the distant field , poor groups , and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these results suggest that at high - z the current star formation activity in star - forming galaxies of a given galaxy mass does not depend strongly on global or local environment , though the possible sfr peak at intermediate densities seems at odds with this conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> we derive cluster - integrated star formation rates and find that the cluster sfr normalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with the star - forming fraction , although we caution that the anticorrelation with mass could be mainly driven by correlated errors . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these trends can be understood given a ) that the average star - forming galaxy forms about one solar mass per year ( uncorrected for dust ) in all our clusters ; b ) how the total number of galaxies scales with cluster mass ; and c ) the dependence of star - forming fraction on cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> these findings show that the most fundamental open question currently remains why the evolution of the star - forming fraction depends on cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> we present the morphology - density relation for our @xmath0 clusters , and uncover that the decline of the spiral fraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of types sc or later , while early spirals ( sa s and sb s ) have a flat distribution with density , similarly to that of s0s . for galaxies of a given hubble type , we see no evidence that star formation properties ( ongoing sfr , [ oii ] equivalent width , 4000 @xmath3 break ) depend on local environment . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with recent findings at low - z , in our distant clusters the star formation - density relation and the morphology - density relation are equivalent , suggesting that neither of the two relations is more fundamental than the other . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the contrasting results at high- and low - z are partly due to different classification methods and/or to evolutionary effects giving rise to a progressive decoupling of the two relations at recent epochs . </S>"
