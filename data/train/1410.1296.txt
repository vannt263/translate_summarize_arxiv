    "are represented by an orthogonal plane to the bloch vector of the target state and a sphere of which center is on the target state , respectively .",
    "we try to explain the two different aspects into a unified mechanism ( equal - distance of extended bloch vectors ) through a mediate example , a non - maximally mixed state .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",

    "fidelity is the concept most frequently used to compare two quantum states in quantum information science because it has legitimate properties  @xcite :    * bounds : @xmath6 , * * @xmath7 iff @xmath8 , * * @xmath9 iff @xmath10 . *",

    ". the physical meaning and derivation of the fidelity can be found in previous works on the transition probability  @xcite and purification of mixed states  @xcite .      the bloch vector is a very common representation of a density matrix @xmath16 for a qubit state  @xcite .",
    "the bloch vector is defined as @xmath17 in @xmath18 , where @xmath19/2 $ ] , and satisfies @xmath20 .",

    "in general , density matrices of which the bloch vectors are located at the same distance from a target vector @xmath44 have different fidelities with the target state @xmath45 . for a simple example , ( *",
    "a * ) equal - fidelity states for a pure target state are represented by an orthogonal plane of the target vector in bloch space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "when one of the states to be compared is pure , the fidelity is written in a simple form as @xmath46   = \\frac{1}{2 } + 2~\\vec \\lambda_t   \\cdot \\vec \\lambda\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ fd1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) .",
    "therefore , a set of @xmath47 on an orthogonal plane for @xmath48 has the same fidelity with the target state . on the other hand , ( *",
    "b * ) for the maximally mixed state ( @xmath49 ) , a set of equal - fidelity states are located at the same distance from the origin of the bloch space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "since the fidelity and the maximally mixed state are unitary invariant , @xmath50 is satisfied .",
    "a unitary operation corresponds to a rotation operation in bloch space , so eq .  ( [ fl0 ] ) means that a set of @xmath51 , which are equivalent under rotation ( have the same length ) , has the same fidelity with the target state @xmath49 ( the origin of the bloch space ) ( qubit ) , the same fidelity states are equivalent to the same purity states ( the same bloch vector lengths ) .",
    "however , for @xmath2 , having the same purity states is a sufficient condition for having the same fidelity states for the target @xmath52 .",
    "for example , @xmath53 and @xmath54 have different purities but the same fidelity with the target @xmath55 . ] .",

    "the fidelity between two qubits can be represented by their bloch vectors  @xcite as @xmath60 if we extend the bloch vector into @xmath61  @xcite , then eq .  ( [ fd2d ] )",
    "is modified concisely as @xmath62 the extended bloch vector @xmath63 is on a hyperhemisphere of @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , namely , an `` uhlmann hemisphere . ''",
    "equation  ( [ fd3 ] ) shows that a set of equal - fidelity states is represented by a hyperplane in @xmath67 , similar to the case of a pure target state in eq .",
    "( [ fl1 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "however , @xmath68 are restricted on the hyperhemisphere of @xmath64 , so the solution is given by the intersection between the hyperplane and the hyperhemisphere .",
    "in other words , the fidelity can be described by the distance between the two extended bloch vectors .",
    "since the euclidean distance of two vectors is represented as @xmath69 , the fidelity is rewritten as @xmath70 using eq .",

    "figure  [ rbeb ] shows schematic diagrams illustrating how to represent equal - fidelity states in bloch space from equal - distance extended bloch vectors .",
    "first , we assume that the target state is on the @xmath77 axis as @xmath71 , without loss of generality ( by a unitary transformation ) .",
    "then we consider the @xmath75 plane in bloch space , which is represented by the blue disk in fig .",
    "[ rbeb ] ( a ) .",
    "when we ignore @xmath78 axis because of @xmath79 = 0 , the disk is converted to a hemisphere in the extended bloch space in fig .",
    "[ rbeb ] ( b ) .",
    "the extended bloch vector of the target @xmath80 is projected on the hemisphere from @xmath48 along the @xmath81 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rbeb ] ( b ) .",
    "a set of vectors @xmath82 , which are located at the same distance from the target @xmath72 , is represented by the intersection of the blue hemisphere and a red sphere in fig .",

    "this argument can be applied to an arbitrary disk plane in the bloch space that contains the origin @xmath83 and the target @xmath84 : @xmath76 axis rotation symmetry .",
    "thus , the total set of equal - fidelity states generally has the form of an ellipsoid in bloch space , as shown in fig .",

    "the vectors on the ellipsoid where @xmath91 are spurious solutions for the cases of @xmath92 , as represented by the black projection in fig .",
    "[ nsol ] .    , there are spurious solutions .",
    "since the extended bloch vectors are restricted by @xmath93 , the projection in black ( @xmath94 ) represents spurious solutions for @xmath92 . ]",
    "the oblate ellipsoid solution ( major axis : @xmath95 plane , minor axis : @xmath76 axis ) in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) has two properties .",
    "the length of the semimajor axis is a function of the fidelity as @xmath96 , and the ratio between the major and minor axes is fixed as @xmath97 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rbeb ] ( c ) and ( e ) , the solution ( green ellipse on @xmath75 plane ) for equal - fidelity states is projected from a circle on a tilted plane ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ rbeb ] ) in the extended bloch space .",
    "since the length of the major axis is not affected by the tilt angle of the plane , it is determined by the distance in @xmath74 or the fidelity .",
    "the ratio of the major and minor axes is a function of the tilt angle @xmath98 ( angle between @xmath72 and the @xmath81 axis ) , so it is given by @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ xz ] , we show examples ( @xmath1001/2 , 2/5 , and 1/6 ) of equal - fidelity states on the @xmath75 plane of the bloch space . they clearly show that the major axis is fixed as the fidelity and the eccentricities of the ellipses are fixed as @xmath101 , the length of the target bloch vector .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in general , we think that two states are very close if their fidelity is 0.99 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xz ] ( a ) , the angle between two pure states for @xmath102 is about @xmath103 . if we consider a simple experiment using a polarization qubit system , it corresponds to about a @xmath104 operational error of a half - wave plate .",
    "the experimental errors of wave plates are typically less than @xmath105 and could be further reduced via motorized rotation mounts .",
    "recently , we experimentally demonstrated operational error - insensitive approximate universal - not gates in a polarization qubit system  @xcite . in the experiment , we measured the error - insensitivity of the gate via the fidelity deviation when the target state is an ideally flipped pure state @xmath106 ( comparable to @xmath101 = 1/2 ) rather than an ideal output state @xmath107 ( comparable to @xmath101 = 1/6 ) of the approximate unot gate , because the fidelities between the erroneous outputs and @xmath108 are very close to unity .",
    "in other words , when the target is @xmath108 ( @xmath101 = 1/6 ) in fig .",
    "[ xz ] ( c ) , the fidelity deviations of the erroneous outputs are very small , since most erroneous outputs are located inside the surface of @xmath102 . thus , the fidelity deviation can be changed by the target state , even though the distribution of states in bloch space remains .",
    "the extended bloch vector @xmath63 for a qubit state ( @xmath109 ) is defined as @xmath110 by adding a fourth component .",
