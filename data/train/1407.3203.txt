    "ultracold fermi gas @xcite , with tunable atom - atom interaction through feshbach resonance @xcite , has been an ideal platform for the study of the crossover physics from weak - coupling bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of bound pairs @xcite .",
    "recently synthetic gauge fields @xcite and spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xcite were realized in experiments , opening up a completely new avenue of research in superfluid fermi gases .",
    "the interplay of zeeman fields and so coupling leads to many novel phenomena at both zero @xcite and finite temperatures @xcite , from mixed singlet - triplet pairing to topological phase transition @xcite .",
    "many of the interesting physics of so - coupled fermi gas can be captured by mean - field theory .",
    "however , it is also true that mean - field theory may fail under many circumstances .",
    "for example , mean - field theory , which does not include the effect of noncondensed pairs , fails to describe accurately the phase transition from a superfluid to a normal gas , particularly for systems with strong interaction .",
    "beyond - mean - field theoretical methods have been proposed @xcite . here",
    "we present a theoretical investigation under the framework of the t - matrix scheme to address the superfluid properties of a rashba so coupled fermi gas over the entire bcs - bec crossover regime @xcite . in the absence of the zeeman field",
    ", it was shown that the so coupling enhances superfluid pairing @xcite . at the mean - field level , we know that the presence of both the so coupling and a perpendicular ( out - of - plane ) zeeman field give rise to effective @xmath0-wave pairing @xcite .",
    "meanwhile introducing an in - plane zeeman component creates an anisotropic fermi surface which favors finite - momentum pairing , giving rise to a fulde - ferrell superfluid @xcite .",
    "these previous studies motivated our present work , in which we investigate the thermodynamic properties of an so coupled fermi gas subject to a zeeman field .",
    "we will focus our calculation on two important quantities that are measurable in experiment : the superfluid to normal transition temperature and the isothermal compressibility .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model_hamiltonian ] , we give an introduction to the rashba so coupled model and briefly describe the t - matrix scheme used in the calculation . then in sec .",

    "the pseudo - gap @xmath21 describes the thermodynamic fluctuation of non - condensed pairs @xcite . below the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are determined by the thouless criterion @xcite within the t - matrix scheme instead of the bcs formalism in the mean - field model .",
    "this is because at finite temperature thermodynamic fluctuation plays a critical role with a tendency towards destroying the pairing condensation .",
    "the thouless criterion for finite pairing momentum @xmath16 takes the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the spin symmetrized pair susceptibility .",
    "more technical details are given in the appendix .",
    "the t - matrix scheme adopted here was first developed in the context of high-@xmath1 cuprates @xcite .",
    "it was later applied to study the bec - bcs crossover phenomenon in ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the t - matrix theory was found to be reasonably successful in providing theoretical support for the measured radio - frequency ( rf ) spectrum @xcite , density profiles @xcite , and thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity @xcite , pressure @xcite , and isothermal compressibility @xcite of ultracold fermi gases .",
    "more recently , this theory was also applied to fermi gases with spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the theoretical calculation qualitatively agrees with the measured rf spectrum of a spin - orbit - coupled fermi gas on the bec side of the resonance .",

    "note that the pseudo - gap tends to zero in the low - temperature limit as @xmath34 [ see eq .",
    "( [ delta_pg ] ) ] and vanishes at @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the t - matrix scheme we adopted here reduces to the mean - field theory at zero temperature .",
    "the rashba so coupling and the zeeman field have opposite effects on the magnitude of the gap parameter : the former tends to enhance the gap , while the latter tends to reduce the gap .",
    "[ crossover_para](a ) displays the gap parameter as a function of interaction strength for several different zeeman fields .",

    "the gap is insensitive to the orientation of the field . in general",
    ", @xmath43 decreases as @xmath44 increases due to the pair - breaking effect of the zeeman field .",
    "however , as @xmath45 exceeds some threshold value , the decrease of the gap becomes sensitive to the orientation of the field : the larger the in - plane zeeman field component is , the steeper the decrease of the gap becomes . as we will show below",
    ", this threshold value corresponds to the field strength at which the quasi - particle excitation gap vanishes .",
    "another important feature induced by the zeeman field is that it closes the bulk quasi - particle excitation gap at a critical value .",
    "[ phase](a ) represents a phase diagram in which we plot the critical zeeman field at which the system changes from gapped to gapless .",
    "the region below each line represents the gapped phase . as the interaction strength varies from the bcs side to the bec side , the order parameter increases [ see fig .  [ crossover_para](a ) ] , and correspondingly the critical field strength increases and the gapped region enlarges . in the absence of the in - plane zeeman field ( i.e. , when @xmath46 ) , the system becomes gapless due to the presence of the discrete fermi points @xcite located along the @xmath47-axis in momentum space at @xmath48 .",
    "these fermi points are topological defects .",
    "hence the transition from the gapped to the gapless region in this case also represents a transition from a topologically trivial to a topologically nontrivial quantum phase . for finite @xmath10 , by contrast",

    "this effect is much more pronounced with the in - plane zeeman field than with the out - of - plane zeeman field , indicating that the finite - momentum fulde - ferrell pairing is less robust than the zero - momentum cooper pairing .    to show the effect of the zeeman field on the transition temperature more clearly , we plot in fig .  [ htc ]",

    "this steep down turn of @xmath1 is particularly pronounced on the bec side of the resonance .",
    "we attribute this steep drop of @xmath1 and the corresponding steep drop of the zero - temperature superfluid gap ( see fig .",
    "[ deltah ] ) to the enhanced fluctuation as a result of the emergence of the nodal surface induced by a large in - plane zeeman field .",
    "the isothermal compressibility , defined as @xmath64 , measures the change in the density @xmath65 in response to the change of the pressure @xmath66 .",

    "this can be intuitively understood as a lower temperature yields a larger superfluid gap , hence a gas less likely to be compressed .",

    ", we see that regardless of the strength of the out - of - plane zeeman field @xmath9 , @xmath67 increases smoothly as the temperature increases from 0 to @xmath1 , just like in a superfluid fermi gas without so coupling @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the presence of the in - plane zeeman field gives rise to some surprising effects . in the right panels of fig .",

    "[ comph ] , where we plot @xmath67 at the unitarity limit at zero temperature as a function of the zeeman field strength . for the out - of - plane zeeman field , @xmath67 decreases smoothly as the field strength increases .",
    "in particular , it does not exhibit any distinctive feature when the system changes from gapped to gapless .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the gapped to gapless transition in the presence of a pure out - of - plane zeeman field represents a topological phase transition which does not leave a trace in thermodynamic quantities . on the other hand , when the zeeman field is in plane with its strength increasing from zero , @xmath67 first decreases and then rises sharply near the critical field when the system becomes gapless .",
    "hence the in - plane zeeman - field - induced gapless superfluid , featuring a fermi nodal surface , is highly compressible .",
    "the nodal surface resulting from the in - plane zeeman field is not unique to rashba so coupling .",
    "for example , in the experimentally realized equal - weight rashba - dresselhaus coupling , a large in - plane zeeman field can also induce a nodal surface @xcite .",
    "we have checked that for that system , the zeeman - field dependence of the compressibility exhibits very similar behavior .",
    "as it is known , using the standard form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for a balanced system , the isothermal compressibility can be rewritten as @xmath78 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath67 is directly proportional to number fluctuation of the system .",
    "the increase in @xmath67 can therefore be interpreted as a consequence of enhanced number fluctuation induced by the nodal surface .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effect of the pairing fluctuation on the thermodynamic properties of a rashba so coupled superfluid fermi gas by adopting a t - matrix scheme .",
    "we focus on the effect of the zeeman field .",
    "in particular , the in - plane zeeman component leads to finite - momentum cooper pairing and , when its magnitude becomes sufficiently large , it induces a nodal fermi surface on which the quasi - particle excitation gap vanishes .",
    "the presence of the nodal surface has dramatic effects on the superfluid properties : it greatly suppresses the superfluid transition temperature and increases the isothermal compressibility .",
    "both phenomena can be attributed to the enhanced fluctuation due to the presence of the nodal surface . by stark contrast , when only the out - of - plane zeeman field is present , both @xmath1 and @xmath67 exhibit smooth behavior when the zeeman field strength is increased , even when the system becomes gapless at large zeeman field strength .",
    "the key difference here is that a large out - of - plane zeeman field , unlike its in - plane counterpart , does not give rise to a nodal surface , but only discrete fermi points along the @xmath47-axile .",
    "these fermi points are topological defects , and their appearance does not manifest on any thermodynamic quantities . in addition",
    ", we also find an unconventional pseudo - gap state above the superfluid transition temperature , in which the non - condensed pairs possess nonzero center - of - mass momentum .",
