    "the effect of coherent backscattering leads to an enhancement of intensity in exact backscattering direction when measuring the average wave intensity scattered from a random medium . known since the years 1984/85 where it has been both described theoretically  @xcite and observed in experiment  @xcite , the acknowledged theoretical explanation commonly presented in today s textbooks ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) holds the following mechanism responsible for this phenomenon : the waves propagating within the medium collect random phases due to the random realization of the scattering potential .",
    "thus , upon averaging over different realizations of the disorder , only those constellations of the intensity propagator survive for which the phase difference between the wave and its complex conjugate counterpart vanishes . two possible kinds of propagation processes are known to lead to exact phase cancellation : the case where the wave and its complex conjugate visit the same scatterers in the same order ( ladder propagation ) ; they propagate the same distance at each step , thereby collecting equal phase . with regard to backscattering",
    ", this process leads to a background intensity which is distributed smoothly over all backscattering angles @xmath1 , since phase cancellation occurs for every backscattering angle ( _ incoherent background _ ) .",
    "however , for systems which exhibit reciprocity symmetry @xcite , exact phase cancellation is also achieved in the case of counter propagating waves ( maximally crossed propagation ) , where again the same scatterers are visited by the wave and the complex conjugate , but in reversed order . resulting in equal phases in exact backscattering direction , _",
    "i.e. _ backscattering angle @xmath2 , but leaving a nonzero random phase shift for every angle other than zero , this gives rise to the sharp backscattering peak centered around @xmath2 , known as the characteristic _ coherent backscattering peak_.    this explanation , however , implies a serious deficiency : it is possible to show  @xcite that for a system where only ladder - like propagation processes are considered , the incoming intensity flux @xmath3 of a wave entering a medium is equal to the outgoing intensity flux @xmath4 , and hence flux conservation is fulfilled . adding the coherent backscattering peak  which yields a non - negative contribution to the outgoing flux for every backscattering angle  on top of the incoherent background therefore violates the fundamental law of flux conservation .",
    "therefore , we may ask which scattering processes counterbalance the maximally crossed contribution and thereby restore flux conservation in the process of coherent backscattering .",
    "this question has been addressed before  @xcite , where experimental studies are described together with a brief theory to explain the results obtained .    in the work presented here , after briefly outlining the theoretical frame ( see chapter  [ sec : frame ] ) , we will show that the ansatz proposed in  @xcite , _ i.e. _ including maximally crossed scattering processes which contain one additional scattering event , does not restore flux conservation ( see chapter  [ sec : scenarios ] ) .",
    "then , we will present the mechanism which we conjecture to meet this goal instead : we consider the full set of possible loop propagation processes by accounting explicitly for the presence of a boundary surface in the case of a finite or semi - infinite medium ( see chapter  [ sec : wl ] )",
    ". this amounts to a complete and consistent treatment of coherent backscattering together with the effect of weak localisation @xcite for wave propagation in disordered media .",
    "finally we verify that this consistent treatment indeed restores flux conservation for coherent backscattering in leading order with respect to the disorder strength @xmath0 ( see chapter  [ sec : leading ] ) .",
    "we treat the propagation of a monochromatic , scalar wave through a disordered medium where it undergoes multiple random scattering . the disorder is described by a potential @xmath5 denoting a random function of position @xmath6 . for the disorder average over many realizations of the disorder of any quantity @xmath7",

    "we may write @xmath11 . furthermore , introducing @xmath12 as the correlation length of the potential , _ i.e. _ as the characteristic length of the decay of the correlation function , we restrict ourselves in the following to the regime where the wavelength @xmath13 of the scattered wave is much larger than the disorder correlation length , _",

    ", the dirac delta distribution is a good approximation for the correlation function for which we hence write @xmath15 with @xmath16 as a pre - factor taking the role of the scattering strength of the potential .    to describe the propagation of a wave with wave number @xmath17 in the presence of the potential @xmath5 we are in general looking for wave amplitudes @xmath18 satisfying the _ scalar helmholtz equation _ @xmath19 for given source distribution @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the laplace operator .    for the vacuum case ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 )",
    "the green s function for the helmholtz operator solving ( [ helm ] ) for a delta - like source @xmath23 is given by the well - known ( retarded ) vacuum green s function  @xcite @xmath24 or by the advanced vacuum green s function @xmath25 as the complex conjugate of ( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 describes the spherical wave at point @xmath6 which emanates from a point - like source at @xmath27 having propagated the distance @xmath28 through empty space .",
    "likewise it is possible to determine the disorder averaged green s function @xmath29 to ( [ helm ] ) in the presence of a disorder potential @xmath30 , where taking the disorder average again implies that instead of specifying the solution for one specific realization of @xmath5 we describe propagation between the points @xmath31 and @xmath6 averaged over many different configurations of the disorder .",

    "this effective wave number @xmath35 turns out to be a complex quantity the non - zero imaginary part of which leads to an exponential damping of the green s function as a consequence of scattering within the disordered medium .",
    "the corresponding decay constant @xmath36 is determined by the imaginary part of @xmath35 in the following way : @xmath37 @xmath36 is referred to as the _ scattering mean free path _ describing the average distance between two successive scattering events . for simplicity , we assume that the real part of @xmath35 is unchanged .",
    "( if necessary , this can be achieved by adding a constant term to the potential @xmath38 . )",
    "the scattering mean free path certainly depends on the properties of the disordered medium and the scattering processes .",

    "ladder approximation_. on a diagrammatic level , the ladder approximation concerns the irreducible intensity vertex @xmath40 determining the propagation @xmath41 of the average intensity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "( [ gbar ] ) , and thereby the scattering mean free path @xcite :    @xmath43    hence , within the frame of ladder approximation , the scattering mean free path depends only on the scattering strength @xmath16 of the disorder potential as it was introduced in ( [ b ] ) .",
    "corrections to @xmath44 beyond the ladder approximation will be considered in chapter  [ sec : leading ] .",
    "furthermore , the expression @xmath45 turns out to be a system parameter classifying the strength of the disorder by comparing the wavelength of the scattered wave to the scattering mean free path .",
    "hence , a large value of the disorder parameter ( @xmath46 ) signifies weak disorder .",
    "following the idea of  @xcite , according to which the contribution of the maximally crossed scattering sequences ( @xmath47-contribution in figure [ scatt ] below ) could be cancelled by the contributions of processes which contain one additional scattering event , we analyze in this chapter the contributions of all such scattering sequences one may possibly construct ( see figure [ scatt ] ) .",
    "the choice of the diagrams selected in figure [ scatt ] can be explained as follows : it is well - known that in the treatment of interference corrections to wave propagation , whenever crossed propagation processes ( @xmath47 ) are taken into account , also the corresponding crossed scattering sequences containing one additional scattering event ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) play an essential role .",
    "this fact manifests itself in the so - called _ dressed hikami - boxes _ ( see for instance  @xcite ) containing exactly these three scattering processes .",
    "it has become clear in earlier works ( e. g.  @xcite ,  @xcite , or  @xcite ) , however , that also other scattering processes can play a role of equal importance , i.e. contribute a term with the same asymptotic behaviour for @xmath50 as the @xmath48 and @xmath51 sequences of the hikami box .",
    "therefore , figure  [ scatt ] lists all diagrams which have been identified as the ones giving rise to the leading corrections ( scaling like @xmath0 or @xmath52 for @xmath50 ) of the conductivity @xcite ,  @xcite and the transport mean free path @xcite ( and , related to the latter by means of a ward identity @xcite , the scattering mean free path @xcite ) in the case of an infinite medium . here , we investigate these same processes in the presence of a boundary surface by connecting the respective scattering sequences directly to the incoming and outgoing waves outside the scattering medium , and calculate the corresponding contributions to the backscattered intensity .    .",

    "let us conclude this section with some remarks concerning the coherent backscattering enhancement factor @xcite .",
    "note that figure  [ all ] only displays the double scattering contribution to coherent backscattering , whereas the renormalized background @xmath201 contains all scattering orders .",
    "adding further scattering orders to the coherent backscattering cone , e.g. taking into also @xmath202 or any other of the processes shown in figure  [ scatt ] , requires a further renormalization of the background , scaling like @xmath52 for @xmath50 , in order to ensure flux conservation .",
    "we expect that this renormalization can be performed in the same way as demonstrated here for @xmath203 ( see also the corresponding discussion in the conclusion below ) .",
    "note , however , that for each of the processes contributing to the background @xmath201 in figure  [ all ] , a corresponding crossed diagram  giving rise to an identical contribution in exact backscattering direction @xmath204  can be found by reversing one of the amplitudes .",
    "therefore , the total coherent backscattering enhancement factor remains unchanged up to the order @xmath0 , and deviations from the ideal value two ( after subtracting single scattering from the background ) scale at least like @xmath52 for our model of a white noise gaussian random potential ( and we expect that the same holds true also for gaussian potentials with non - vanishing correlation length ) .",
    "note that this does not contradict the result of @xcite , where deviations of the backscattering enhancement factor of the order @xmath0 have been shown to occur as a consequence of recurrent scattering for a discrete scatterer model ( which is non - gaussian , since recurrent scattering amounts to a non - vanishing fourth order cumulant ) .",
    "concerning the mechanism restoring energy conservation in the effect of coherent backscattering , we have obtained the following results : the leading order of coherent backscattering , found to arise from @xmath128-scattering ( double scattering event of the crossed contribution ) , can not be counterbalanced by scattering processes including one additional scatterer , since the contributions of these scattering processes where found to scale in higher order of @xmath0 .",
    "we could not establish any cancellations between the higher order processes , either , which contradicts the previous theory presented in  @xcite .    on the other hand , it turned out to be crucial to develop a full description of coherent backscattering in the frame of the loop propagation processes as considered in the description of weak localisation in infinite disordered media  @xcite . considering all possible constellations of a weak localisation loop with respect to the boundary surface of the scattering medium ,",
    "one finds additional scattering contributions which equally have to be taken into account . for the leading order contribution",
    "( scaling like @xmath0 for @xmath50 ) we present an approximate description of the scattering process as an anisotropic random walk . within the frame of this approximation , it is possible to obtain a flux - conserving description of coherent backscattering . for the remaining higher order processes depicted in figure  [ scatt ] ,",
    "we raise the hypothesis that each contribution to coherent backscattering is in the same way cancelled intrinsically in the frame of a complete description accounting for all possible constellations in the presence of a boundary surface : according to this hypothesis , flux conservation is established for an arbitrary contribution to the irreducible intensity vertex @xmath205 ( e.g. @xmath206 in figure  [ ext ] ) when taking into account all four possibilities of connecting @xmath207 and @xmath208 either directly to the incoming ( or outgoing ) wave outside the scattering medium or to other points ( @xmath209 or @xmath173 in figure  [ ext ] ) within the scattering medium .    a possible ansatz in order to prove",

    "this is the main motivation of the present paper .",
    "practical consequences concerning , e.g. , the comparison between theoretical and experimental coherent backscattering cones in order to determine properties of the scattering medium , remain to be investigated . in this case , effects like internal reflections due to a refractive index mismatch @xcite or the finite correlation length of the random medium  which have been neglected in the present paper  must also be taken into account",
    ". it will be interesting to see to what extent the flux - conserving scattering diagrams identified in the present paper then lead to predictions that differ from other approaches ( e.g. @xcite ) , and whether this will enable a more accurate determination of scattering properties such as the transport mean free path .",
