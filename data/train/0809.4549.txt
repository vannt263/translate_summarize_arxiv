    "the properties of fermionic systems with imbalanced populations have long been of interest for a variety of reasons .",
    "of particular importance is the pairing mechanism resulting in composite bosonic particles and leading to superconductivity / superfluidity .",
    "the original focus  @xcite was on polarized superconductors with an imbalance between the two spin populations where it was predicted that the cooper pairs form with a center of mass momentum equal to the difference of the fermi momenta of the two populations .",
    "this fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase @xcite proved to be difficult to observe in solids and was only achieved recently in heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental realization of trapped ultra - cold fermionic atoms with tunable attractive interactions has intensified interest in this problem .",
    "experiments , in which two hyperfine states of ultra - cold fermionic atoms play the role of up and down spins , have demonstrated the presence of pairing in the case of unequal populations.@xcite this has spurred much theoretical work using a variety of approaches such as mean field @xcite , effective lagrangian,@xcite bosonisation @xcite and bethe ansatz @xcite applied to the uniform system with extensions to the trapped system using the local density approximation ( lda ) .    for the uniform case ,",
    "the controversy continues on the details of the paired state : fflo pairs forming with non - zero momentum _ vs",
    "_ breached pairing ( bp ) at zero momentum@xcite and on the robustness of such phases .",
    "distinguishing features between these two possibilities include the presence , for fflo , of spatial modulations ( inhomogeneity ) in the pairing order parameter , and consequently a peak at non - zero momentum in the pair momentum distribution function as opposed to the coexistence of a superfluid and normal component in a translationally invariant and isotropic state in the bp scenario .",
    "in addition , excitations are gapped for the fflo phase but not so for bp .",
    "no general consensus has emerged on which pairing type dominates .",
    "however , recent exact numerical work on the ground state of one - dimensional fermi systems with imbalanced populations loaded into optical lattices has found that fflo is the only pairing mechanism both in the uniform  @xcite and the trapped  @xcite systems .",
    "similar results have been found without the optical lattice.@xcite on the other hand , approximate dynamical mean field ( dmft ) results appear to indicate that no fflo phase is present in the three - dimensional system.@xcite    in addition to the above equal - mass cases , of relevance in condensed matter and trapped ultra - cold atomic systems , there is great interest in the case of unequal masses .",
    "this arises naturally in trapped mixtures of different atomic species , _",
    "e.g. _ k - rb , and also in cold dense quark matter where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are much heavier than the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks .",
    "it was argued theoretically that such mass and population imbalance leads to the bp phase  @xcite with gapless excitations which can be stabilized by longer - range interactions.@xcite in this paper we examine this question with exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "we focus on the one - dimensional system loaded into an optical lattice governed by the extended hubbard hamiltonian    @xmath4    where @xmath5 are fermion creation ( annihilation ) operators on spatial site @xmath6 with the fermionic species labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the corresponding number operator . the unequal masses are embodied in the unequal hopping parameters .",
    "we set the energy scale by taking @xmath9 and studying the system as @xmath10 gets smaller ( @xmath11 gets larger ) .",
    "in general , the interaction term @xmath12 can couple all fermions on all sites ; in what follows we shall consider three different forms .    for our simulations , we use a continuous imaginary time canonical  worm \" ( cw ) algorithm where the total number of particles is maintained strictly constant.@xcite in this algorithm , two worms are propagated , one for each type of fermion , which allows the calculation of the real - space green functions of the two fermionic species , @xmath13 , and the pair green function , @xmath14 , @xmath15 it is then immediate to obtain the momentum distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 from their fourier transforms .",
    "we emphasize that this algorithm is exact : there are no approximations and the only errors are statistical ( which typically correspond to the size of the symbols ) .",
    "the polarization is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the minority ( majority ) particle numbers .",
    "the associated fermi wave vectors are @xmath20 .",
    "we ran our simulations at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( typically @xmath23 ) is the number of lattice sites .",
    "we have verified that these values are large enough to yield the ground state properties , which is our focus .",
    "typical runs takes a day or two on a desktop computer .",
    "we begin with the simplest form for the interaction term , @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ only contact attraction ( @xmath26 ) between the two species .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows what happens to the minority ( left ) and majority ( right ) momentum distributions as @xmath10 is decreased for fixed @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for @xmath29",
    ", @xmath16 drops sharply at the respective fermi momenta , @xmath30 while at the same time , the pair momentum distribution , @xmath17 , exhibits a maximum at @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] left ) .",
    "this indicates pair formation at non - zero center - of - mass momentum and thus an fflo phase.@xcite as the mass of the majority particles increases , @xmath10 decreases , the attractive interaction effectively increases because @xmath32 increases .",
    "the increased binding is demonstrated by @xmath33 which takes values between @xmath34 ( no binding ) and @xmath35 ( all minority particles have formed pairs )  @xcite .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( triangles , right panel ) scaled by @xmath36 for better visibility .",
    "clearly , as @xmath10 decreases , @xmath37 increases toward its upper limit .",
    "as a consequence of this increased binding , the fflo effect first intensifies , its peak at @xmath31 increases in height , reaches a maximum for @xmath38 , then decreases and disappears as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( circles , right panel ) .",
    "note , for example , that for @xmath39 the peak of @xmath17 , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) , is at @xmath40 .    also noteworthy",
    "is the appearance of a dip in @xmath41 , at @xmath42 , whose depth increases with decreasing @xmath10 , reaching a maximum for @xmath38 , corresponding to the maximum fflo effect . further decreasing @xmath10 washes this out .",
    "this feature can be understood as follows .",
    "as @xmath10 decreases , the interaction between the minority and majority effectively increases ( @xmath32 ) , thus increasing the depletion of @xmath43 .",
    "most of the depletion for both @xmath44 and @xmath41 happens for @xmath45 since this is where most of the minority resides .",
    "this depletion for @xmath45 leaves @xmath41 with a bump for @xmath46 .    at first glance , it might seem that the disappearance of the fflo peak , @xmath47 , as @xmath10 decreases and the appearance of a peak @xmath48 signals pair formation at @xmath40 and thus a bp phase .",
    "however , a simple argument offers another option .",
    "the fermi momentum of the majority is @xmath49 ; consequently , as these particles get heavier , @xmath10 smaller , their kinetic energy becomes negligible and can be ignored . to minimize its free energy ,",
    "the system will then optimize the potential and kinetic energies of the light particles .",
    "the optimal potential energy is obtained when the light particles are on the same sites as the heavy ones . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic energy is optimized when the light particles are delocalized .",
    "both these energies can be optimized if the heavy particles coalesce , forming a contiguous region with one heavy particle per site , @xmath50 .",
    "this region , then , acts as a platform on which the light particles can delocalize over its entire extent while always being in contact with the heavy particles thus minimizing their potential energy .",
    "this is indeed what happens as the density profiles , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for two polarizations . to summarize ,",
    "as @xmath10 decreases , the system goes from an fflo phase to a spatially collapsed one .    to quantify this collapse",
    ", we define the quantity  @xcite @xmath53 which is essentially zero when the system is uniform ( @xmath54 ) and grows as the collapse happens . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show @xmath55 versus @xmath56 for three polarizations and three couplings in each case .",
    "we see that , indeed , the system collapses as @xmath10 decreases and that for a given polarization , this collapse appears to happen at approximately the same value of @xmath56 .",
    "also , the larger the polarization , the easier it is to trigger the collapse ( larger @xmath10 ) .",
    "this behavior holds for all the parameters we examined , specifically @xmath57 , and polarizations @xmath58    we , therefore , conclude that in the presence of only contact attraction , the bp phase is _ not _ realized as the majority population is made heavier ; instead the system collapses . to counter the tendency of the heavy particles to clump together as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we introduce longer - range interaction .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that near neighbor ( nn ) repulsion between particles of the same species would tend to oppose such collapse . to this end",
    "we redid the above study but with the interaction term @xmath59 with @xmath26 and @xmath60 .",
    "we studied this for @xmath61 for @xmath62 and found that , indeed , the stability of the system against collapse is extended to smaller values of @xmath10 but that eventually the system always collapses . furthermore , before the collapse , the system always exhibits fflo pairing while after collapse , the nn repulsion term , @xmath63 , produces density oscillations as the presence of near neighbors is opposed .",
    "therefore , this second form of the interaction also fails to produce the bp phase .",
    "we now turn to the third interaction form which was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and argued to yield the bp phase .",
    "this form extends beyond the contact term and acts only between particles from different species .",
    "the idea is based on the assumption of three competing homogeneous phases : a normal state of free fermions , a fully gapped bcs superfluid and a gapless bp phase .",
    "it was argued that by giving the interaction term structure in momentum space , one may be able to stabilize the bp phase ; a gaussian dependence on distance was used for the interaction potential  @xcite . in our simulations we cut the range at the nn level and , therefore , have @xmath64 .",
    "note that , unlike the previous form , @xmath63 here acts only between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in momentum space , this has the form @xmath67 at momentum @xmath68 and , with @xmath26 and @xmath69 , is more attractive at small @xmath68 in contradistinction to the pure contact interaction which is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "our exact qmc results show , however , that the system is still unstable and collapses as @xmath10 decreases , just like in the contact interaction case .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : no bp phase has been found .",
    "in fact , with the longer - range attraction , the system is even _ more _ unstable as can be easily understood by the same real space argument presented above for the contact interaction case .",
    "so far , we have considered the case where the heavy particles are the majority which leads to collapsed configurations like those in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the question then is : will the system still collapse when the heavy particles are the minority and what form will the collapsed configurations take ?",
    "we now consider this case with a heavy minority population @xmath71 , and a lighter majority , @xmath72 , on a @xmath73-site lattice with @xmath74 .",
    "as before , we fix the light population hopping @xmath75 to define the energy scale and we study the collapse as a function of the heavy minority hopping parameter , @xmath76 , and the attractive interaction , @xmath77 . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show , like in fig .  [ fig4 ] , @xmath55 as a function @xmath78 for five different values of the interaction , @xmath79 .",
    "the behavior is similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; we find that for these values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath55 increases sharply for @xmath82 signalling spatial collapse in the system .",
    "one candidate for the collapsed confiugration is that , as before , the heavy particles ( the minority in this case ) form a contiguous region thus providing a platform for the lighter particles .",
    "this would then result in a contiguous region with one heavy and one light particle per site and the excess light majority particles spread over the rest of the system .",
    "this , however , does not minimize the energy because the light particles residing on the heavy particle platform are blocked : they are in a mott state and have zero kinetic energy . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show a typical density profile of a collapsed configuration .",
    "it is easy to understand energetically why this density wave structure is favored over the previous candidate : the light particles are never blocked in a mott region and can always hop to neighboring sites to optimize the free energy .",
    "we note that the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] corresponds to phase separation : in one region the system is in a charge density wave phase , in the other region it has free fermions .",
    "these two phases co - exist . on the other hand , the configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] correpsond to spatial collapse : the system has a regions void of particles and regions where all the particles reside .",
    "finally , we consider the question of canonical versus grand canonical ensembles . it has been suggested  @xcite that the stability of bcs , fflo or bp phases can depend on whether one fixes the populations or the chemical potentials .",
    "all the above results have been obtained with the cw algorithm where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are kept strictly fixed . an alternative is to add the chemical potential term , @xmath83 , to the hamiltonian , eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , and use a grand canonical qmc algorithm such as the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) algorithm.@xcite we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the momentum distributions obtained with the cw and the dqmc algorithms with @xmath84 and @xmath85 chosen to give average fillings corresponding to the fixed fillings in the canonical case .",
    "there is no disagreement between the two ; in particular , the fflo phase is seen to be stable whether one fixes the populations or the chemical potentials .",
    "of course , if one changes @xmath10 while holding the chemical potentials fixed , the average populations , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , will change . nonetheless , whatever @xmath86 and @xmath88 one has obtained by fixing @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one",
    "will obtain the same physics in the canonical ensemble by fixing the populations to the corresponding values , as seen in fig .",
    "one is free to study these phases and their stability in either ensemble .",
    "in summary , we have studied , using exact qmc simulations , the effect of mass differences between two imbalanced fermion populations . for the case where the majority population is the heavier",
    ", we performed our study with three possible attractive interaction terms . in all three cases ,",
    "we have found the system to be unstable and to collapse when the mass disparity is large enough : the bp phase is not realized by tuning the mass ratio between the two populations . for the case where the minority is heavier , we showed the system still collapses when the mass difference is large enough , but in this case it forms density wave structures .",
    "we have also shown that fixing the populations or the chemical potentials leads to the same physics .",
    "the stabilization of sought - after phases is not favored by one ensemble rather than another .",
