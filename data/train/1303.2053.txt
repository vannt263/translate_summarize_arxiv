    "the random - field ising model is a prototypical example of a system in which the presence of quenched disorder has a drastic effect on the collective behavior.@xcite while long - range ferromagnetic order is still observed above a critical dimension , as in the pure ising model , the properties of the associated critical point are strongly modified by the random field . in a renormalization group ( rg ) setting , temperature is irrelevant at the fixed point and the long - distance physics is therefore dominated by disorder - induced , sample - to - sample fluctuations rather than by thermal fluctuations.@xcite this leads to anomalous scaling relations due to the existence of an additional critical exponent associated with temperature , to a shift of the lower and upper critical dimensions , a very slow spatial decay of the correlation functions at criticality , and a very strong slowing down of the dynamics close to the critical point that can be described in terms of an unconventional activated dynamic scaling.@xcite    one of the puzzles about the critical behavior of the rfim was the property of _ dimensional reduction _ , according to which the behavior in the presence of a random field is the same as that of the pure system in two dimensions less .",
    "this property , found to all orders in conventional perturbation theory@xcite and also nonperturbatively derived as a consequence of an underlying supersymmetry of the model at zero temperature@xcite , was proven to be wrong in @xmath2.@xcite from the supersymmetric approach it was understood that the failure was related to the presence of metastable states , _",

    "the interest in long - range models has a long history and comes from the fact that the presence of long - range , power - law decaying , interactions decreases the lower critical dimension of a model and that varying the exponent of the power law in a fixed dimension allows one to find a spectrum of critical behavior that goes from mean - field for truly long - range interactions to the absence of transition for short - range decay while spanning a continuous range of nonclassical behavior in between . in some sense , changing the exponent of the power law at fixed dimension is like changing the dimension in a short - range model .    to study dimensional reduction and its breakdown ,",
