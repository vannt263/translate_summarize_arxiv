    "the ages of stellar clusters are usually determined by fitting a set of theoretical isochrones to its cmd .",
    "when the stellar system is a globular cluster the age derived is usually considered an estimate of the age of the universe .",
    "another estimate of the age of the universe , the expansion age , comes from the hubble constant with dependence on the density parameter @xmath11 and the cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "these ages , derived by entirely independent techniques , generally do not agree particularly well .",
    "the expansion age of a flat universe ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 is a relatively young 9.3 gyr whereas one globular cluster , m92 , seems to be 14 gyr old ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are some counter - claims that other globular clusters might be younger ( @xcite ) based on revised hipparcos distances for subdwarfs , but these are largely statistical studies and the @xcite study did incorporate the new hipparcos distances .",
    "the above discussion illustrates that the age of the universe , a critical parameter in choosing amongst possible cosmological models , is still quite uncertain .",
    "one approach to providing more confidence in an age estimate is to determine it from a number of different techniques .",
    "the age of the universe could be estimated from the very old wds found in globular clusters in a manner similar to the age determination of the disk of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , a technique quite independent of isochrone fitting to cluster main sequences .",
    "we have carried out some tests of the accuracy of wd cooling models in our investigation of the wd population in the globular cluster m4 ( @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "it now remains to obtain imaging data deep enough to see the termination point of the wd cooling sequence in this and other galactic globular clusters .",
    "an additional test of the accuracy of wd derived ages is to obtain the age of an open cluster from its wds and compare this with the cluster turnoff age ( see @xcite for an early effort in this direction ) .",
    "many of the difficulties in determining globular cluster ages are absent when considering open clusters .",
    "there is empirical knowledge of the mass - luminosity relation for population i stars and , unlike globular clusters , metallicity effects are generally not an issue .",
    "the isochrones are thus better constrained and main sequence fits of these models to real cluster cmds are more reliable .",
    "what is required here is a rich open cluster that is nearby , relatively old ( so that there is a substantial population of wds ) , at high galactic latitude ( to reduce field contamination ) and lightly reddened .",
    "the outstanding candidate is m67 .",
    "studies of the cmd of m67 trace the history of such work from early photoelectric observations done on a star - by - star basis ( @xcite ) , to deep photographic studies ( @xcite ) , through to modern investigations with ccds ( @xcite ) .",
    "racine commented on the lack of wds in his cmd ( none were found in excess of the expected background ) and made the suggestion that none existed in the cluster brighter than @xmath16 .",
    "this was in contrast to an earlier statement by @xcite that about 3 dozen wds existed in the cluster between magnitudes 20 and 22.7 .",
    "the montgomery et al .",
    "study found 5 objects bluer than @xmath17 but these stars do not appear to lie along any recognizable cooling sequence .",
    "the isochrone age of m67 has been estimated by numerous authors with the range extending from just older than 3 gyr to almost 6 gyr with the most recent ages , incorporating the best stellar models , giving ages near 4 gyr ( ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xcite ) . the total cluster mass has been estimated to be about @xmath20 ( @xcite ) and @xcite indicated that up to half the mass of the cluster could be composed of wds .",
    "we comment on these estimates at the end of this contribution .",
    "most of the observations for the present work were obtained during an excellent 5 night run in january 1997 using the uh8k imager on the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "this mosaic imager has 8000@xmath218000 15@xmath22 pixels which project to an area of 28@xmath23@xmath2128@xmath23 on the sky , just slightly larger than the 23@xmath23 diameter of m67 . aside from a number of short exposures made to avoid saturating the brightest stars in the cluster , all the images obtained had an exposure time of 1200 sec . in total , 15 @xmath24 and 11 @xmath25 frames",
    "were obtained centered on the cluster and 14 @xmath24 and 13 @xmath25 exposures were secured of a blank field at the same galactic latitude as m67 and about 1.2 degrees away in longitude .",
    "numerous photoelectric standards ( @xcite , 1992 ) were also observed on all the 8 individual ccd chips making up the mosaic and independent calibrations were derived for each chip .",
    "the photometric solutions had an average scatter of 0.014 magnitudes in @xmath24 and 0.017 in @xmath25 .",
    "the blank field images were dithered so that a median filtered image of them provided the flat field .",
    "the seeing was generally quite good during the run becoming as excellent as 0@xmath265 and degrading to worse than 1@xmath262 at times .",
    "the data were reduced using allframe ( @xcite , 1994 ) with a quadratically varying point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the errors in the photometry in the m67 field for stars in the magnitude bin @xmath27 were typically 0.06 magnitudes and for @xmath28 the errors were 0.10 magnitudes . in the blank field",
    "the equivalent numbers were 0.07 and 0.12 magnitudes .",
    "in figure 1 we present the @xmath8 , @xmath29 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m67 ( left - hand panel ) and the blank field ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "the objects plotted in both these diagrams only include images that appeared to be stellar in appearance ( see @xmath304.2 ) . in the m67",
    "cmd a distinct main sequence is observed beginning at the cluster turnoff near @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and extending to at least @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the main sequence may extend to the limit of the data but the paucity of stars at faint magnitudes on the main sequence make this difficult to determine .",
    "the turnoff is sharply defined and a subgiant branch and red clump is observed , these latter stars taken from the compilation of @xcite as they were saturated on our images .",
    "an extensive sequence is seen lying above the m67 main sequence and there is little doubt that this is due to binaries as has been noted by numerous other authors ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "a few cluster blue stragglers are noted near @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the wall of stars lying below the m67 main sequence is composed of faint field stars , most likely in the halo .",
    "the color of the bluest of these field stars is redder than the m67 turnoff so these stars are almost certainly older than m67 .",
    "it is unlikely that their redder color comes from enhanced metallicity with respect to m67 as the cluster has a metallicity close to solar .",
    "one final feature of the m67 cmd is a population of faint blue stars that are stretched out along a sequence beginning near @xmath37 and projecting into the smear of objects ( faint unresolved galaxies ) centered at @xmath38 and @xmath39 . as we shall see , this locus is the m67 wd cooling sequence and this is the first time that a clear wd cooling sequence has been seen in this or in fact _ any _ old open cluster .",
    "the cmd of the blank field reproduces the main features seen away from the m67 cluster sequences but no very bright stars are seen as they were saturated on our long exposures .",
    "the number of objects in the blank field cmd is smaller than the total of field stars seen in the m67 frames as we only included in figure 1 those stars which were present on the overlapping area of the blank field chips .",
    "since these exposures were dithered by a large amount in order to construct a flat field , only about @xmath40 of the area covered by the m67 exposures is included in the right - hand panel of figure 1 .",
    "when we investigate the statistics of the objects found in both the cluster and blank fields in the next section , we will have to account for this by counting each observed blank field star @xmath41 times . in the blank field cmd",
    "there are a few objects seen in the region occupied by the cluster wds . from the data given in @xcite",
    ", 11 field wds ought to have been found in an area the size covered by our cluster data brighter than @xmath42 and bluer than @xmath43 .",
    "we actually count 8 such objects in the blank field which , coincidentally , scales up to 11 when we correct for the area difference .",
    "these will be removed statistically when we adjust the cluster counts for background and foreground contamination .",
    "figure 2 replots the m67 cmd and superimposes on it cooling curves for @xmath7 ( upper ) and @xmath44 pure carbon core da ( h - atmosphere ) wds .",
    "the cooling sequences were derived using the interior models of @xcite and the model atmospheres of @xcite as discussed in @xcite , 1997 .",
    "the @xmath7 cooling sequence is clearly a very good fit to the wd data above an @xmath8 of @xmath45 .",
    "this is likely to be a reasonable estimate of the masses of m67 wds it is the same as those found in the hyades ( @xcite ) .",
    "fainter than @xmath34 the situation is confused by the presence of the large number of faint galaxies .",
    "even with this contamination there does appear to be a  pile - up \" of objects in the cmd near @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "wds will tend to  pile - up \" in a cmd as they cool more slowly as they age .",
    "below , we will identify this clump of objects with the termination of the wd cooling sequence in m67 . in the right - hand panel of figure 2",
    "we replot the @xmath7 wd cooling sequence and indicate along it cooling times to different magnitudes . if the background galaxies and the field stars can be successfully removed from the m67 cmd , the termination point of the wd cooling sequence will be located and this can then yield a lower limit to the age of the cluster .",
    "this age will only be a lower limit since the main sequence lifetime of the progenitor of coolest wd must be added its cooling time to obtain the true cluster age . however ,",
    "if the coolest wds seen in m67 evolved from massive main sequence stars , the correction is minimal and the wd cooling time is an excellent approximation of the cluster age .",
    "we also include in figure 2 an isochrone for an age of 4.0 gyr and a metallicity of @xmath48 = -0.04 $ ] ( * * ? ? ?",
    "* * hob91 ) .",
    "this isochrone was kindly supplied to us in advance of publication by @xcite and is clearly an excellent fit to the cluster cmd .",
    "we will use this age below to compare with the wd cooling age of the cluster .",
    "\\(0 ) we determined incompleteness corrections in both the m67 and blank fields by adding stellar psfs of differing magnitudes directly in to the frames and established the recovery statistics .",
    "the added stars were placed along a @xmath7 wd cooling sequence shifted to m67 s distance and to be counted as a recovery the star had to be found in both the @xmath24 and @xmath25 frames .",
    "the recovery statistics differed little between the blank and cluster fields so we combined them together and found that down to @xmath38 the completeness fraction was 1.0 , from @xmath49 to @xmath50 it was @xmath51 , from @xmath52 to @xmath53 it was @xmath54 and between @xmath53 and @xmath55 it was @xmath56 .",
    "\\(1 ) we ran the image classifier sextractor ( @xcite ) on all the objects in the cluster and the blank field .",
    "sextractor provides a class parameter which ranges from 0 to 1 with low numbers being galaxies and high numbers stars .",
    "we then matched up the sextractor objects with the output from allframe and plotted class versus the allframe sharp parameter and @xmath24-magnitude for both the cluster and blank fields .",
    "these plots indicated that a reasonable lower cut - off for the stars was 0.8 .",
    "there are undoubtably some galaxies leaking in to the stellar sample with little leakage in the other direction due to the excess number of galaxies present compared to stars ( to @xmath1 in the cluster fields the galaxies outnumber the stars @xmath57 to @xmath58 while in the blank field the ratio is @xmath59 to @xmath58 ) .",
    "we then removed all the objects classified as galaxies from our lists .",
    "\\(2 ) we then rectified the @xmath7 cooling sequence to make it vertical in a pseudo - cmd which plotted @xmath24 magnitude versus color distance from the now vertical cooling sequence .",
    "the stars were included in this diagram and we set up bins in both the cluster and blank field cmds that were @xmath60 magnitudes wide in @xmath24 and @xmath61 wide on either side of the cooling sequence in ( @xmath62 ) . the width in color represents the @xmath63 photometric errors at faint magnitudes . to correct for the smaller area in the blank field we multiplied the number of objects in each bin in the blank field by @xmath41 and applied the incompleteness corrections to both data sets .",
    "\\(3 ) lastly , we subtracted the blank field numbers from those in the cluster , bin by bin , and calculated the errors associated with each bin .",
    "these uncertainties include errors in the incompleteness corrections as well as the counting errors but none from the sextractor classification .    in figure 3",
    "we plot , as a histogram , the results of the above analysis .",
    "this diagram indicates a `` pile - up '' of wds in the bin centered at @xmath38 and suggests that the wd luminosity function terminates at @xmath64 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the cooling time to this absolute magnitude for a @xmath7 pure carbon core wd with a hydrogen atmosphere is 4.3 gyrs .",
    "this age can be compared with the isochrone age of the cluster of 4 gyr shown in figure 2 .",
    "changing the core composition to a mixture of carbon and oxygen makes less than a @xmath65 difference in the age while changing the atmosphere to he ( db wds ) has a similarly small effect .",
    "it is only for much older wds that such changes become important .    to assess the uncertainty in the above wd cooling age for m67",
    ", we note that had we taken the bin center as the termination point , the cooling age would be 3.5 gyrs .",
    "if the masses of the cooling wds were @xmath66 different than assumed , the cooling age would be 3.7 gyr ( @xmath67 wds ) or 4.5 gyr ( @xmath68 wds ) .      as a last point we consider whether the number of wds found in m67 is consistent with expectations .",
    "the total number actually found is about 85 down to the termination point of the wd cooling sequence and this number must be corrected for those in binaries . as we demonstrate below , about 50% of the m67 stars are in binary systems which likely means that we must increase our estimate of the number of wds by @xmath69 suggesting a total population of about 150 .    from an analysis of the cluster dynamics",
    ", @xcite concluded that up to half the mass of the cluster could be contained in wds .",
    "if we take the total cluster mass to be @xmath20 ( @xcite ) about 600 wds ought to have been discovered , clearly at variance with our results .",
    "we have rederived the cluster mass by simply adding up the mass of the cluster objects seen as we have observed the entire cluster with the exception of a few very bright giants which were added in to our sample from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "objects in various portions of the cmd were counted ( after correcting for the number of field stars ) and assigned masses using the mass - @xmath8 relation of @xcite for faint main sequence stars and that of @xcite for @xmath70 gyr for stars which were above the chabrier et al .",
    "limit but below the turnoff point .",
    "we chose as single main sequence stars all those which fell along the fiducial of the main sequence in a band @xmath71 magnitude wide in @xmath72 .",
    "binaries were chosen to be all those stars above the upper limit of this band to a limit of @xmath73 magnitudes in @xmath24 above the middle of the main sequence .",
    "these objects had their masses doubled and were found to contribute a substantial @xmath74 to the total cluster by mass . by number ,",
    "fully 50% of the m67 stars are tied up in binary systems .",
    "stars above the turnoff were assigned a mass of @xmath75 and the wds @xmath7 .",
    "this yielded a mass of @xmath76 with the wds contributing about @xmath77 of this , @xmath78 of the cluster total .",
    "the expected number of wds can be estimated from complete model isochrones , such as those of @xcite . to proceed ,",
    "we adopt an initial mass function ( imf ) : @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "this ( salpeter ) value is similar to that for field stars in the relevant mass range ( @xcite ) , however , the results are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath81 for suitably short cooling times .",
    "the mass function was normalized with the 87 post - turnoff stars counted in our cmd ( this excludes blue and yellow stragglers ) and the @xcite 4 gyr isochrone .",
    "this predicts @xmath82 wds with a cooling age @xmath83 1 gyr .",
    "similar numbers are obtained from less model - sensitive but cruder evolutionary timing arguments applied to the red giant clump stars .",
    "since we observe only 24 wds with cooling ages @xmath83 1 gyr , this suggests that we are only seeing @xmath84% of the expected number of bright wds .",
    "some , or perhaps even the majority of the missing wds are hidden in binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "a further complication is the loss of stars through dynamical evolution .",
    "m67 has a short relaxation time ( @xcite ) and an inverted mass function ( @xcite ) , suggesting a significant loss of stars .",
    "the large binary population in m67 not only affects the morphology of the cluster cmd , complicating the interpretation of the luminosity function , but also strongly influences the dynamical evolution . a better understanding of these effects is required to fully interpret the wd luminosity function in m67 .",
