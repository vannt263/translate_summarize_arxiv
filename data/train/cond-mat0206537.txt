    "haldane s conjecture @xcite about the fundamental difference between integer and half - odd - integer spin chains has triggered a strong interest in low - dimensional systems with arbitrary spin @xmath0 , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "new materials have been found which can be considered as realizations of spin chains with @xmath1 . for low - dimensional models mean - field theories",
    "are usually not very reliable due to the importance of quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore exact results become very important .",
    "they allow to explore possible phases and study their properties .",
    "since only few models are solvable exactly , e.g.   by bethe - ansatz @xcite , it is necessary to reach out for alternative methods .",
    "next to numerical procedures like dmrg @xcite powerful analytical approaches are available . in this paper",
    "we use the idea of optimum ground states @xcite which allows to construct systematically _ exact _ ground states .",
    "the method is not restricted to one - dimensional spin systems , but can also be generalized to construct ground states for quantum spin systems in arbitrary dimensions @xcite , hubbard models @xcite or stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "a prominent example for a spin-2 chain is ( 2,2-bipyridine)trichloromanganese(iii ) where the spin-2 is carried by @xmath2 and the magnetic interaction by the @xmath3 orbital overlap .",
    "experiments by granroth et al .",
    "@xcite show antiferromagnetic behaviour with exponentially decaying correlation functions . in the present letter",
    "we will construct states which exhibit exactly this behaviour with a non - degenerate ground state .",
    "not only antiferromagnetic phases can be realized for a spin-2 chain but also weak antiferromagnetic and weak ferromagnetic ones . as the method of optimum ground states allows us to calculate ground state expectation values and properties for these states",
    ", it provides a good overview over the large variety of phases encountered in spin-2 chains and their properties .    in the following we consider quantum spin chains described by a translational invariant hamiltonian @xmath4 with nearest neighbour interactions @xmath5 .    * definition . *",
    "a _ global _ ground state @xmath6 is called _ optimum ground state _ ( ogs ) of @xmath4 , if the global ground state energy @xmath7 is just the sum of the local ground state energy values @xmath8 of the local hamiltonians @xmath5 .    in other words : if the local ground state conditions @xmath9 are complied ( which can be achieved by adding the constant @xmath10 to the local interaction @xmath5 ) this yields the equivalence @xmath11 since then @xmath12 is a lower bound for @xmath7 . the r.h.s .  of ( [ e.ogs ] ) can be used as local conditions for the existence of an optimum ground state and its realization in terms of a _ matrix product ground state _ ( mpg ) ( see below ) .",
    "obviously ogs are states without finite - size corrections . in @xcite",
    "the matrix product ground state approach has been described in more detail .",
    "for the spin-1 chain @xcite it is possible to construct one type of matrix product ground state for a hamiltonian with the three symmetries 1 ) rotational invariance in the ( @xmath13)-plane , 2 ) spin flip invariance , 3 ) translation and parity invariance . in the case of spin-2 chains with these symmetries and",
    "nearest neighbour interaction we find five different non - trivial mpgs .",
    "it can be understood easily that there exist no more than these five mpg except for exponentially degenerate ones @xcite .",
    "usually it is most common to find exact or approximate ground states or even the full spectrum for a _ given _ hamiltonian .",
    "the modus operandi we use here is the other way around .",
    "first we construct the optimum ground states for a given system and then we determine the subspace of hamiltonians for which these are the ground states . describing the local hamiltonians @xmath5 in terms of local eigenstates @xmath14 of @xmath15 ( eigenvalue @xmath16 ) and the parity operator @xmath17 ( eigenvalue @xmath18 ) and the spin flip invariance lead to @xmath19 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "for some sets of quantum numbers @xmath20 the @xmath14 are not determined completely by the imposed symmetries .",
    "additional superposition parameters control the `` orientation '' of the basis states @xmath14 in their respective subspace . requiring that a given ogs is an exact ground state of @xmath21 leads to restrictions on the @xmath22 and the superposition parameters of the @xmath14 . for a spin-2 system with nearest neighbour interaction and above mentioned symmetries",
    "the total number of parameters is 22 @xcite .",
    "two parameters , the energy off - set and a scale , are trivial which leads effectively to a 20 parameter model .",
    "for the most general model there are 25 local energy eigenstates .",
    "as expected such a model with 20 parameters in general has very complicated ground states of the global hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "the concept of optimum ground states and its realization through mpg yields a class of structural simple states . for these it is possible to calculate ground state expectation values for arbitrary operators .",
    "the isotropic valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) model @xcite emerges as a special case and the properties of this model turn out to be generic for a more general subspace of the 20 parameter space .",
    "following the procedure explained in @xcite one can define several matrices which are suited for constructing matrix product ground states of the spin-2 chain .",
    "such a matrix consist of single - spin states at site @xmath23 as their elements and the product of two such matrices is defined as a matrix product with the tensor product @xmath24 for the spin states @xmath25 * definition .",
    "* a _ matrix product ground state _ ( mpg ) is a global ground state of a spin chain of length @xmath26 , which for periodic boundary conditions can be written in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for  trace over the matrix space \" ,  _ i.e. _ @xmath29 . for a mpg to satisfy the above optimum ground state condition ,",
    "@xmath30 must hold for all @xmath23 . due to the product structure of the ground state @xmath6",
    "this reduces to @xmath31    this implies that each element of the product matrix @xmath32 is a local ground state ( of @xmath33 ) .",
    "these conditions lead to several restrictions on the parameters from the most general model .",
    "so the matrix product ground state becomes a global ground state of the specified parameter subspace .",
    "the mpg itself turns out to depend on up to three parameters . to calculate expectation values and other physical properties a transfer matrix approach  @xcite",
    "can be used .",
    "results thus obtained are presented in the following sections .",
    "we have investigated systematically matrix product states on a spin-2 chain with unique or finitely degenerate ground states and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we found five mpgs with non - trivial product structure and different properties . in the following",
    "only the most significant properties will be presented .",
    "a more complete account will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the first mpg is defined by the homogeneous product @xmath34 of matrices @xmath35 this representation with three continuous , real parameters @xmath36 uses the canonical spin-2 basis states ,  _ i.e. _  the eigenstates of the @xmath37-operator @xmath38 and @xmath39 at site @xmath23 . since all @xmath33 should be the same ( for all @xmath23 ) we have to solve ( [ e.gsc ] ) for one arbitrary @xmath23 only .",
    "these conditions lead to a 12 parameter subspace and an additional trivial parameter for the scale . in general inequalities",
    "must hold for these parameters . for more details see @xcite .",
    "this parameter space includes the isotropic point .",
    "the ground state itself depends on the three parameters @xmath36 and is _ unique _ , which can be proven rigorously by complete induction @xcite . for the parameter set @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ) one obtains the isotropic point of the model where the matrix product ground state reproduces the vbs state @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as sum of the projection operators onto the @xmath41 and @xmath42 multiplets .",
    "for any other set of parameters the model has an anisotropy along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "however , in any case the ground state is unique as long as @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath45 the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) is not unique ; the degeneracy grows with system size as @xmath46 .",
    "this case is not considered in the following .",
    "the ground state defined by ( [ eq_haf1a ] ) is antiferromagnetic in the sense that all single - site magnetisations vanish : @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that the square of the fluctuation is simply given by @xmath48.\\ ] ] the maximum @xmath49 is reached in the limit @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 . in the latter case",
    "the dominant contribution is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "the 2-site correlation functions decay exponentially to zero .",
    "the longitudinal correlation function is given by @xmath54 with the longitudinal correlation @xmath55 the first part of the function is the expectation value of the nearest neighbour correlation which is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath56 ) and varies from @xmath12 ( for @xmath57 ) to @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) @xcite . for large @xmath60",
    "the correlation function alternates in @xmath61 as an easy axis anisotropy is observed .",
    "the transversal correlation function decays exponentially , too , @xmath62    both correlation lengths @xmath63 and @xmath64 are finite ( except for @xmath65 , see fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) and so the model is non - critical . the @xmath60-dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] &  [ f.1 ] ) looks quite similar to the spin-1 mpg correlation lengths presented in @xcite . for large @xmath60 the anisotropy is of easy - axis type with @xmath66 whereas for small @xmath60 it is of easy - plane type .",
    "indeed this mpg is the analogue of the matrix product ground state of the spin-1 chain , e.g.  the isotropic point ( see fig .  [ f.2 ] ) is included in this phase for both spin chains . for both chains the antiferromagnetic phases ( including the two antiferromagnetic ones described in the next subsections ) are haldane phases with 1 ) a unique ground state , 2 ) exponentially decaying correlation functions , and 3 ) a gap to the first excited state .",
    "here we only have shown 1 ) and 2 ) of this scenario , but the existence of a gap can be shown along the lines of the proof outlined in @xcite .",
    "different from the spin-1 chain it is possible to construct further matrix product ground states for the spin-2 case . a simple",
    "one is a homogeneous product of matrices @xmath67 which in contrast to the haldane - antiferromagnet - a depends on one continuous parameter @xmath60 and one discrete parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the state @xmath69 looks quite similar to the one presented in @xcite for the spin-1 case .",
    "again it can be shown that it is a unique ground state of @xmath21 in the appropriate subspace .",
    "even the expectation values of all combinations of the @xmath70 operators look the same as in the spin-1 case , only expectation values of @xmath71 or @xmath72 operators vary by a factor .",
    "the properties of this phase are much the same of the one before and so we report some expectation values only .",
    "the single - site magnetisations vanish and the square of the fluctuation just as the longitudinal correlations function are the same as the ones for the spin-1 chain @xcite .",
    "different from the spin-1 chain the transversal correlation function reads : @xmath73 the correlation length @xmath64 is the same as in @xcite , only with a different prefactor .",
    "replacing in ( [ eq_haf1b ] ) the spin states @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 we obtain a third matrix product ground state , which is the _",
    "unique _ ground state in a 16 parameter subspace of the most general 20 parameter model .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath37-operators are the same as the ones above , except of a factor coming from the higher @xmath37-eigenstates ( @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 ) . for other operators , e.g.   @xmath80 ,",
    "the method of transfer matrices shows that elements like @xmath81 become relevant .",
    "because the matrix contains elements proportional to @xmath82 and @xmath75 only , this always leads to zero and therefore @xmath83 .",
    "however , the expectation values of biquadratic operators of this type do not necessarily vanish , e.g. @xmath84",
    "in the following we will show that also other antiferromagnetic phases can be realized by the matrix product technique , e.g.  a phase characterized by a vanishing total magnetisation of two neighbouring sites @xmath85 , but with finite single - site magnetisation @xmath86 .",
    "if the sublattice is not fully polarized ,  _ i.e. _  @xmath87 , the corresponding state will be denoted as _",
    "weak antiferromagnet_.    in order to realize a weak antiferromagnet using the mpa we introduce the two matrices @xmath88 using these matrices , two different mpgs can be constructed by assigning the matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 to different sublattices : @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the first case to every odd lattice site",
    "a matrix @xmath90 is attached and a matrix @xmath89 to the even numbered sites . in the second case",
    "the situation is reversed .",
    "therefore the ground state is twofold degenerate and each ground state depends on the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the single - site magnetisation alternates from lattice site to lattice site and can be written as @xmath93 for @xmath94 the sub - lattice magnetisation becomes @xmath95 . in the limit",
    "@xmath96 the magnetisation is @xmath97 for values @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 . for @xmath101 but @xmath102 a strict nel order with @xmath103 and @xmath104 is realized .",
    "the magnetisations in @xmath105- and @xmath106-direction vanish for the whole subspace @xmath107 the fluctuation @xmath108 varies in the range of 0 to 1 .",
    "it takes its maximum for @xmath94 and @xmath50 .",
    "the longitudinal correlation function is given by @xmath109 and alternates in @xmath61 .",
    "it decays exponentially to a constant contribution @xmath110 which is a result of translation invariance breaking .",
    "the amplitude @xmath111 is positive and depends on the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the transversal correlation function decays exponentially to zero .",
    "again , the correlation lengths stay finite for all values . in the limits",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath113 both correlation lengths , the transversal and the longitudinal , diverge .",
    "for @xmath45 the ground state degeneracy grows exponentially with the chain length .",
    "the next two matrix product ground states look quite similar to the ones above .",
    "the main difference is that the translational invariance is not broken here . with the matrices",
    "@xmath114 the two mpg @xmath115 and @xmath116 can be constructed . due to the spin flip symmetry 2 ) one has to ensure that both states are ground states of @xmath21 which then is twofold degenerate .",
    "just as expected the single - site magnetisation in @xmath43-direction reads @xmath117 and in @xmath105- resp .  in @xmath106-direction @xmath118 .",
    "the square of the fluctuation @xmath119 shows the same @xmath60-dependence as the one from the spin-1 mpg @xmath120 the correlation lengths are the same as in the spin-1 case , @xmath121 differences can be found in the longitudinal correlation function itself .",
    "the possibility to choose either @xmath122 or @xmath123 leads to a finite contribution to the correlation function @xmath124 this partially polarized state is structurally similar to an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "it can be viewed as a haldane - type state , but with finite magnetization .",
    "this is also reflected in the behaviour of the correlation function ( [ corr_wf ] ) which agrees with that of the haldane - af - b up to the long - range order part which is zero in the latter case .",
    "the results presented here show that for a spin-2 chain the spectrum of possible mpg is much larger than for a spin-1 chain .",
    "we found three antiferromagnetic phases with unique ground state , exponentially decaying correlation functions and finite excitation gap .",
    "therefore the corresponding phases can be classified as haldane phases or spin liquids .",
    "their structure is similar to that found in the case of the spin-1 chain @xcite .",
    "similar antiferromagnetic phases can not be constructed for the spin-@xmath125 chain @xcite . however , in this case a weak antiferromagnetic and a weak ferromagnetic phase exist .",
    "related states can also be constructed in the present spin-2 case .",
    "the weak antiferromagnet shows exponentially decaying correlation functions with long - range order .",
    "the ground state is twofold degenerate reflecting the breaking of translation invariance and leading to a finite sublattice magnetisation .",
    "the weak ferromagnet has a twofold degenerate ground state , but full translation invariance .",
    "the magnetisation per site in @xmath43-direction takes the constant value 1 , which is just half of the fully polarised ferromagnet .",
    "interestingly , despite the finite magnetisation , this state is structurally similar to an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "we believe that the exact results presented here are generic for spin-2 chains in a similar way as previous results @xcite are for spin-1 chains . here for the isotropic case ,  _ i.e. _  the bilinear - biquadratic chain , an exact solution using ogs is only possible for one point , the aklt - chain @xcite .",
    "however , a whole extended phase exists with the same properties . in this sense",
    "the exact results allow to study the generic properties of such phases without having to rely on approximate or numerical methods ."
