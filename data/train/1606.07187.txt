    "this problem is in fact reduced to determining the connection coefficients among non - holomorphic solutions for the okubo system .",
    "we solve this connection problem by means of the middle convolutions for schlesinger systems . in this paper",
    "we deal with the particular cases of types @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; other cases will be discussed in our forthcoming paper .",
    "it is known by a celebrated work of katz @xcite that any irreducible rigid local system can be constructed by a finite iteration of the so - called katz operations ( additions and middle convolutions ) from a local system of rank one .",
    "dettweiler and reiter @xcite reformulated the katz operations so that they can be applied directly to schlesinger systems and their monodromy representations .",
    "therefore , any irreducible rigid schlesinger system , as well as its monodromy representation , can be constructed in principle from the rank one case . in the case of okubo systems ,",

    "a special combination of katz operations @xmath13 ( middle convolution with additions at a singular points ) is used effectively for constructing the okubo systems in yokoyama s list .",
    "in fact , each okubo system in yokoyama s list can be constructed by a finite iteration of such operations from the rank one case .",
