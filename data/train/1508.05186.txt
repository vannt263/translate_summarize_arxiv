    "to check the astrophysical origin of the new line , we added narrow ` zgaussians ` corresponding to known astrophysical lines in this range .",
    "for example , according to the newest atomic database atomdb v.  3.0.3 , there are s  xvi line complexes at 3.355 , 3.398 , 3.424 , 3.441 , 3.452 and 3.460  kev .",
    "fortunately , the intensity of these lines can be robustly predicted by the measured s  xv line complex at @xmath02.63  kev , see fig .",

    "we paid special attention to potential contribution from k  xviii lines near 3.51  kev , see e.g.  @xcite for details .",
    "the distance between these lines is smaller than the energy resolution of _ xmm - newton_/epic , so we modeled the k  xviii line complex as a single ` zgaussian ` with mean energy 3.51  kev .",
    "because there is no `` reference '' potassium line to reproduce the 3.51  kev line flux , we fixed only the upper bound of the 3.51  kev line intensity relating it to s  xvi line flux at 2.63  kev ( or , if 2.63  kev is not detected in the dataset  to its 2@xmath2 upper bound ) using the procedure described in  @xcite . to derive electron temperature , we used flux ratios of strong elemental lines , namely s  xv lines at 2.45  kev , s  xvi lines at 2.63  kev , ca  xix lines at 3.90  kev and ca  xx lines at 4.10  kev . because 3.51/2.63  kev line ratio is a decreasing function of electron temperature @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : s - lines - ratio ] , we used minimal temperature @xmath33 $ ] for conservative estimate .",
    "another source of uncertainty comes from the ( largely unknown ) relative k / s abundance ratio .",
    "to account possible uncertainties  @xcite we allowed this ratio to be up to 3  solar values of  @xcite .",
