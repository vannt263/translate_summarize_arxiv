    "two lattices in @xmath4 are called _ similar _ if they are related by a non - zero similarity . for a given lattice @xmath22 , the similar sublattices ( ssls ) form an important class , and",

    "clearly , @xmath25 .",
    "one can show @xcite that @xmath23 is super - multiplicative , i.e. , @xmath26 for coprime @xmath27 .",
    "it is not always multiplicative , as one can see from considering suitable rectangular lattices in the plane @xcite , such as the one spanned by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , in many relevant cases , and in all cases that will appear below , @xmath23 is multiplicative .",
    "this motivates the use of a dirichlet series generating function for it , @xmath30 which will then have an euler product expansion as well .",
    "if @xmath3 is a generic lattice in @xmath4 , the only ssls of @xmath3 will be its integrally scaled versions , i.e. , the sublattices of the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 . in this case ,",

    "let us first summarize some general properties of the generating functions in this context .",
    "the following statement follows from a simple conjugation argument .",
    "[ invar - similar ] if @xmath3 and @xmath36 are similar lattices in @xmath4 , one has @xmath37 .",
    "given a lattice @xmath22 , its _ dual _ lattice @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39    [ invar - dual ] if @xmath3 is a lattice in @xmath4 , one has @xmath40 .    if @xmath5 is any ( non - zero ) linear similarity in @xmath4 , one has @xmath41 which , in view of , is immediate from the relation @xmath42 .",
    "observing @xmath43 , one thus obtains an index preserving bijection between the ssls of @xmath3 and those of @xmath38 , whence we have @xmath44 for all @xmath14 .",
    "this gives @xmath40 .",
    "[ duality ] defining the transposed similarity via the scalar product makes it transparent that there is a certain scaling degree of freedom to choose the non - degenerate bilinear form without changing the result of fact  [ invar - dual ] , which is in line with fact  [ invar - similar ] .",
    "as is apparent from the treatment in @xcite , the usual description of @xmath0 as a lattice in a @xmath17-dimensional hyperplane of @xmath45 , see figure  [ a4-fig ] , gives access to the possible values of @xmath15 , and hence to the possible indices , but not necessarily to the actual similarities and the ssls .",
    "therefore , we use a description in @xmath46 instead , which will enable us to use quaternions , based on the inclusion of a root system of type @xmath0 within one of type @xmath47 , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "quaternions are thus also written as vectors , @xmath54 , and the algebra is equipped with the usual conjugation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . for later use , we also introduce the reduced trace @xmath57 and the reduced norm @xmath58 in a quaternion algebra via @xmath59 if we work over the field @xmath60 , we shall also need its trace and norm , defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the algebraic conjugation in @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 .",
