    "the metallicity distribution of long - lived dwarfs and the age - metallicity relation are two often - quoted constraints of the chemical evolution of the galactic disc : the latter constraint is considered to be weak , whereas the former one is considered to be a strong , or even the strongest constraint .",
    "both conclusions are usually perceived as definitive observational results . on the first point , this is illustrated by the vast majority of papers published in the last decade on the chemical evolution of the galactic disc , which is described similarly with prolonged infall controlling its progressive inside - out formation . the main motivation for adopting infall being the capacity to reduce the number of metal poor stars born at early ages , providing a solution to the so - called g - dwarf problem .",
    "how robust is the observational basis - the dwarf metallicity distribution - of such uniformity in models ?",
    "the unbiased metallicity distribution of dwarfs is usually obtained by weighting the metallicity bins of local samples using a relation between metallicity and the vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) as measured on these same samples . due to the small statistics in the lower metallicity bins and the uncertainties that plague the photometric metallicity scales , this process leads to large uncertainties in the level of corrections that are applied , as can be testified by the variety of [ fe / h]-@xmath1 relations found in the literature ( see fig .",
    "the recent release of large catalogues of solar neighbourhood stars ( nordstrm et al . 2004 , valenti & fischer 2005 ) containing radial velocities should significantly improve the situation .",
    "the level that this relation should reach at [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.4 dex is usually not questioned ( with the exception of sommer - larsen ( 1991 ) ) , however it is shown here that the inclusion of the thick disc stars introduces significant modifications to the diagnostic of the g dwarf problem. after having questioned the metallicity scales in haywood ( 2001 , 2002 ) , we point here to the ambiguity caused by the thick disc population , which , if included in local samples , makes the observed distribution compliant with the predictions of the simple closed - box model .",
    "this suggests that some caution should be exercised as long as most of the evidence for prolonged infall is limited to the so - called g dwarf problem.    since edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) the age - metallicity distribution ( hereafter amd ) is often commented as being highly dispersed at all ages , providing a poor constraint to chemical evolution models of the galaxy .",
    "two recent studies , based on large photometric datasets , have claimed a similar result ( feltzing , holmberg & hurley 2001 ; nordstrm et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , and though it has received little attention ( but see pont & eyer 2004 ) , these recent amds illustrate a rather atypical chemical evolution , where the youngest stars ( @xmath23 gyrs ) show the largest range of metallicity , stars between 5 and 10 gyrs show negative evolution ( i.e. mean decreasing metallicity with age ) , and the lowest metallicity stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.5 ) are more often young ( age @xmath2 5 gyrs ) than old . although such non - conventional evolution is not excluded ( one can think of an enhanced infall episode increasing the dilution of metals in the ism ) , confirmation is needed . moreover , the large dispersion at all ages is difficult to reconcile with the very small dispersion that is measured either in the local ism ( cartledge et al .",
    "2006 ) , on meteoritic pre - solar grains ( nittler 2005 ) , or abundance ratios , which all suggest that the gas from which stars are born is very homogenenous at all times in the disc , the thick disc , and probably the halo ( arnone et al .",
    "2005 )    in the following section , we present a discussion of recent metallicity distributions and scale height corrections , while the third section focuses on the biases in the age - metallicity relation .",
    "section 4 presents a derivation of a corrected amd , which although not optimised , is quite different from the previously cited studies .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we first review the metallicity scales used in recently published studies of the local metallicity distribution , then focus on the scale height corrections .      in discussing the local metallicity distribution",
    ", the value at which this distribution peaks is a key issue , related to the thick disc . in a closed - box model",
    "centred on solar metallicity , the percentage of material which forms between [ fe / h]=-1.0 and -0.50 is about 18 - 20% . allowing for a thick disc with about 5 - 8% of the local stellar density and a scale height of about 800 - 1000 pc , we arrive at a percentage of 16 - 21% of the total stellar surface density ( assuming 250 pc scale height for the thin disc ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in these parameters , the 2 estimates can be considered as compatible . if the observed peak was at [ fe / h]=-0.2 dex or lower , the predicted percentage of stars between -1.0@xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.5 in a closed box model centred on this value ( -0.2 dex ) would be higher than @xmath0 30% , a value incompatible with the thick disc characteristics .",
    "the thick disc and photometric metallicity scales are therefore at the centre of the discussion about the mean metallicity of the solar neighbourhood stars , but the literature published on the subject since 1989 shows this mean has a high variability .",
    "the mode of the metallicity distribution of long - lived dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood has fluctuated between -0.4 dex ( pagel 1989 ) and -0.05 dex ( haywood 2001 ) , with intermediate values by wyse & gilmore ( 1995 ) , rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xcite and jrgensen ( 2000 ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since , for example , over the same period , the same quantity for halo stars has been left relatively undisputed at @xmath0 -1.5 dex .",
    "one possible reason is that halo stars are often measured spectroscopically , while , paradoxically , systematic spectroscopic surveys of nearby disc stars have commenced only very recently ( luck & heiter 2005 ; valenti & fischer 2005 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2004 ) , impulsed in particular by planet - search programs .    since haywood ( 2001 ) ,",
    "a few studies relevant to the g - dwarf problem have been published , in particular from @xcite , and the spectroscopic complete surveys just mentioned .",
    "the metallicity scale by @xcite differs from ours by a significant amount ( 0.2 dex ) , and we go here into some detail explaining the origin of this difference . then we compare with spectroscopic surveys .",

    "there is a difference of about 0.2 dex between the distribution @xcite and that of haywood ( 2001 ) .",
    "we now try to clarify this point .",
    "@xcite assert that the calibration used in haywood ( 2001 ) is biased , based on a ( b - v,[fe / h ] ) plot ( their fig .",
    "8) taken from our sample of long - lived dwarfs ( haywood 2001 ) .",
    "however , judging a calibration from a set of selected long - lived dwarfs is strongly misleading , because it shows only stars that are chosen on the basis of their colour being redder than a given isochrone .",
    "this process imposes a limit that , varying with metallicities , is colour - dependent .",
    "this limit is visible on their fig 8 , where they show our sample of long - lived stars .",
    "it is only an effect of the selection of long - lived dwarfs , not of the metallicity calibration .",
    "this is the sense of the bias seemingly detected by kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , and which therefore has nothing to do with a bias in the metallicity calibration we used .",
    "although their explanation is incorrect , @xcite conclusively find a discrepancy of about 0.2  dex between their calibration and the one we adopted , evaluated with 104 common stars .",
    "what can be the origin of this discrepancy ?",
    "we have already commented on our metallicity scale in haywood ( 2002 ) and nothing new in kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002b ) indicates a possible problem of our calibration ( see also a discussion of our results by taylor & croxall 2005 ) .",
    "could the problem originate in the metallicity calibration of kotoneva et al . ?",
    "figure  [ koto ] shows the solar metallicity isochrone of @xcite they take as a reference scale , which difference of absolute magnitude to a given star is used as a metallicity indicator . on the same plot",
    ", we also show the hyades sequence as given by de bruijne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , together with a fit representing this sequence .",
    "since the hyades cluster has a metallicity of + 0.14  dex , we would expect its sequence to be systematically 0.12 magnitude above the isochrone ( according to the relation between metallicity and the difference in magnitude of kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ) .",
    "as can be seen from the plot , this is not the case : the hyades sequence is systematically _ below _ the isochrone at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the difference is much less than 0.12 magnitude between these limits .",
    "that means their isochrone is probably in error , and it follows that the calibration of kotoneva et al . will systematically underestimate the metallicity of the stars over the whole colour range ( by about 0.15 dex ) , and most severely at @xmath5 .",
    "although their solar metallicity isochrone is incorrect when compared to the hyades sequence , it seems to fit well the hr diagram of field , calibrating stars , selected on the basis of photometrically determined metallicity ( fig .",
    "9 of kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ) .",
    "how can this be understood ?",
    "kotoneva et al . do not fit their isochrone to solar metallicity stars _ per se _ , but to stars selected to have @xmath6_{photo}<0.3 $ ] .",
    "the argument assumed by the authors being that , due to observational errors in the determination of photometric metallicities , and the peaked distribution of metallicities , stars in the metal - rich part of the metallicity distribution ( at solar metallicities , in this case ) will be contaminated by the lower , dominant , metallicities ( at [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.2 dex , in their study ) . to correct for this effect , and to select stars which have a metallicity which is truly solar , the authors select stars showing photometric metallicities in the range @xmath6_{photo}<0.3 $ ] .",
    "this process meets two difficulties : first , the correction can be safely evaluated _ only _ if the metallicity distribution is known a priori , which is a dubious method since the metallicity distribution is what they want to determine .",
    "second , if the solar neighbourhood metallicity distribution peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath00.0 , and not -0.2 dex ( and assuming a symetrical distribution ) , then the correction to apply when selecting solar metallicity stars is zero .",
    "if this is the case ( haywood 2001 ) , it implies that the calibrating stars in @xcite are , in the mean , genuine high metallicity stars .",
    "unfortunately , very few of the 26 calibrating stars of @xcite have a spectroscopic metallicity in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "however , hip 99825 has a metallicity -0.09 dex ( + 0.05 , israelian et al .",
    "2004 ) ; hip 58345 has a metallicity of + 0.16 dex ; hip 19788 has + 0.04 dex ; hip 15919 + 0.26 dex and + 0.33 dex , hip 74135 , 0.16 dex .",
    "it is also possible to compare the metallicities in the whole catalogue of kotoneva et al .",
    "( 2002b ) ( not only the calibrating stars ) with spectroscopic measurements . for the 31 stars in common with the catalogue of @xcite ,",
    "the mean difference is 0.107  dex , in the sense that @xcite underestimate the metallicities . using the newly published data by kovtyukh , soubiran & belik ( 2004 )",
    ", we found that , for 34 stars in common between these two studies , the mean difference is also at 0.11 dex .",
    "laws et al . ( 2003 ) find a similar difference between their spectroscopic values and the metallicities of @xcite .",
    "the great majority of these common stars have b - v@xmath21.1 .",
    "the coincidence between their isochrone and the hyades sequence in this same colour interval ( see fig . [ koto ] ) implies a similar mismatch in metallicities . at b - v@xmath71.1",
    ", the difference rises to larger values ( implying underestimates probably larger than 0.2 dex ) , their reference isochrone being above the hyades sequence . as a last check ,",

    "this amounts to 0.095 dex and 0.17 dex differences if the spectroscopic metallicity of the hyades is 0.14 dex , and is consistent with our comments of the metallicities of field stars .",

    "the study of @xcite is based on the calibration of schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) , which , for k dwarfs , is known to produce a strong bias on solar and super - solar metallicity stars , when applied on the strmgren photometry of olsen .",

    ".    our result , based on local data , is compatible with arguments of galactic structure evocated in the introduction that , given the properties of the thick disc ( scale height and local density ) , this population should contribute ( at -1.0 @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.5 dex ) a rough 15 - 20% of the - corrected for volume effect - metallicity distribution .",

    "\\(d ) the median value calculated in ( overlapping ) subsamples of 200 points between 10 gyrs and the youngest stars shows that the increase of metallicity between the 2 limits is of the order of -0.15 dex , with a small upturn at age @xmath2 3 gyrs .",
    "there is a change of slope when shifting from the thin to the thick disc , for which the metallicity increases by about 0.5 dex within 5 gyrs .",
    "\\(e ) as a final test to the effect of our corrections on the atmospheric parameters , we selected stars that are known to belong to the thick disc according to their kinematics .",
    "we have cross - correlated our sample with the compilation of stars published by soubiran & girard ( 2005 ) , which yielded 29 stars .",
    "these 29 stars are shown on all four plots of fig .",
    "[ revisedamr ] as solid star symbols .",
    "the most remarkable result is seen when comparing the different age distributions . in the first case ( plot ( a ) , gcs catalogue ) , no particular trend is seen , and the spread of points illustrates our comments on the various biases ( see the previous section ) .",
    "part of this spread is reduced with the ages derived from the isochrones of yi , kim & demarque ( 2003 ) , due to the fact that no correction to the effective temperature scale of the models has been applied , hence we avoid the bias detailed in section 3.3.3 , which generates young metal - poor stars .",
    "the new ages calculated with the corrected atmospheric parameters ( fig . [ revisedamr](c ) ) show a clear , distinct trend of increasing metallicity with decreasing age , and confirms the existence of an age - metallicity relation within the thick disc proposed by bensby , feltzing & lundstr \" om ( 2004 ) . in this case",
    ", we have neglected the @xmath13-element content and set [ @xmath13/fe]=0.0 dex . finally , in fig .",
    "[ revisedamr](d ) , we use the value of @xmath13-element content listed in soubiran & girard ( 2005 ) for each star to compute the isochrones and derived the ages .",
    "the correlation obtained is even better than in the previous plot ( c ) .",
    "we reviewed the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood published in the recent years and find that recent spectroscopic datasets show good agreement with our own finding ( haywood 2001 ) , with a peak at [ fe / h]=-0.05 . using scale height corrections based on a @xmath1-[fe / h ] relation derived from a sample of solar neighbourhood stars , we arrive at the conclusion that there is no deficit of metal poor stars relative to the closed box model .",
    "the low metallicity part ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.5 dex ) of our relation being dominated by thick disc stars , this conclusion is valid only if the thick disc stars are genuine disc stars , not of extragalactic origin .",
    "it is also in agreement with expectations from simple arguments of galactic structure .",
    "standard chemical evolution models usually acknowledge the existence of a thick disc as a genuine galactic population , but its contribution to the local solar radius metallicity distribution is often underevaluated . on the other hand , looking at the metallicity distributions recently published , we find the contribution of stars having the metallicity of the thick disc to be generally incompatible with simple galactic structure constraints .    despite the recent detailed analysis of large photometric strmgren data sets",
    ", it appears that published amd are essentially reflecting noise in the determination of atmospheric parameters and derived ages .",
    "significant improvement should come from reducing systematic biases in the determination of metallicity and effective temperatures from photometric indices .",
    "a first step in this direction is made here , and shows a limited increase in the mean metallicity of the thin disc , superposed on another , steeper relation in the thick disc .",
    "this scheme confirms that the disc has endured most of its chemical evolution during the thick disc phase , and has remained ( chemically ) unchanged since then .    in the last 3 gyrs ,",
    "the measured dispersion in metallicity is 0.10 - 0.11 dex , compatible with error measurements , and implying a small scatter of the young disc population .",
    "after 3 gyrs , the progressive appearance of a metal rich population reaching [ fe / h]@xmath0 + 0.5 dex at ages greater than 5 gyrs is established .",
    "it is suggested that these super metal - rich stars are the contaminant objects resulting from radial migration from the inner disc .",
    "a similar spread at lower metallicity is seen at approximately the same age , giving stars reaching [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.7 at 5 gyrs , attributable to an equivalent migration from the outer disc .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with the ( b - v , [ fe / h ] ) distribution presented in section 3 , which , although independent of any age determination , is a source of information on the amd . note also that the metallicity scale of the ( b - v , [ fe / h ] ) distribution is independent of the strmgren metallicity scale used in the derivation of ages .",
    "if this general picture is correct , we expect that the metallicity distribution at age greater than 3 gyrs is a superposition of a narrow ( about 0.05 dex or less ) distribution of stars born at solar radius and a broader distribution of stars that haved moved to the solar radius .",
    "we note that the metallicity distribution of fuhrmann ( 2004 , figs .",
    "49 and 50 ) presents such characteristics , with clearly a superposition of 2 gaussians with dispersions of about 0.05 and 0.25 dex centred on solar metallicity .",
    "altogether , these elements point to a picture where chemical and dynamical evolution lead to structured , if complex , patterns of age and metallicity , but not a general , structureless , dispersion .",
    "it is apparent that , in the level of abundance reached by the galaxy prior to the thin disc formation as well as in the shape of the local metallicity distribution , the thick disc must have played a central role .",
    "this is now discussed .",
    "is there a continuity argument to invoke when discussing the origin of the thick disc ?",
    "inspection of @xmath13 elements ratios @xmath19 metallicity plots ( see pritzl , venn & irwin ( 2005 ) , reddy , lambert , & allende prieto ( 2006 ) for example ) suggests the following : ( 1 ) the halo presents no evidence of having been enriched by sneia ( even when allowing for a generous thresold in galactocentric rotational velocity at about + 100 - 120 km / s , see fig . 2 in pritzl et al , 2005 ) .",
    "there have been suggestions that low [ @xmath13/fe ] implied contamination by sneia . however , most recent studies ( arnone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and references therein ) indicate that halo stars seems to have a higher level of homogeneity in element ratios [ x / fe ] than previously thought ( @xmath2 0.06 dex ) , with levels of [ @xmath13/fe ] compatible with no contamination by snia .",
    "( 2 ) while there is a clearly visible increase of the [ @xmath13/fe ] ratio towards low metallicity stars of the thin disc ( [ @xmath13/fe]=0.10.2 dex at about [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.5 -0.7 dex , see reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , fig .",
    "12 ) , there is no evidence that the thin disc has escaped contamination by snia .",
    "( 3 ) in the solar neighbourhood at least , the thick disc seems to be the _ only _ population that shows both enrichment phases by sneii and sneii+sneia , suggesting that the thick disc could be a transition population between the halo and thin disc .",
    "the suggestion is made stronger if one realises that an extragalactic thick disc would require that an accreted satellite have just the right ( @xmath13/fe , fe / h ) pattern to meet the halo on one side and the thin disc on the other . as a matter of fact , there is no detected chemical or kinematical discontinuity between the rotating halo and thick disc ( see gratton et al .",
    "2003 ) so far .",
    "if the small dispersion of abundance ratios measured on halo stars is confirmed , then the continuity between enrichment levels in the different elements between the halo and the thick disc should become a stringent constraint for the origin of this last population .",
    "for example , nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) measured [ mg / fe]=0.41 with a rms dispersion of @xmath20.06 dex on halo stars with -3.2@xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.8 , while reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 and references therein ) measured thick disc stars to have a similar rms dispersion and [ mg / fe ] comparable with that of nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.8dex .",
    "confirmation on a larger scale is needed , but it suggests that the rotating halo and the thick disc may be the same population .",
    "there is however an observed discontinuity between the thin and thick discs , with the ( @xmath13/fe , fe / h ) sequence of the two being almost parallel .",
    "it has been proposed that since the most metal - rich stars in the thick disc have a higher metallicity than the most metal - poor stars in the thin disc , there has been a dilution of metals by an infall episode in the temporal gap between the two populations ( bensby et al .",
    "2005 ; reddy et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the amd of the previous section shows that metal - poor disc stars are not specifically old for their metallicity , a characteristic that is not expected if it is assumed that the first thin disc stars had formed after the infall episode at [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.6 dex .",
    "moreover , the amd of fig . 13 shows that the mean metallicity of old disc stars is nearer to [ fe / h]=-0.2 dex than -0.6 dex , a fact which does not fit well with the dilution scenario above .",
    "a perhaps more convenient explanation is that metal - poor thin disc stars found in local samples have been moved to the solar neighbourhood by radial migration from outside the solar circle .",
    "this scenario , suggested by our conclusions that the amd has been shaped by radial migration , is also well in agreement with the results presented by carney et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and yong , carney & de almeida ( 2005 ) .",
    "these authors present evidences , from open clusters , field giants and cepheids , that the mean disc metallicity decreases to ( -0.4 , -0.6 ) dex at r@xmath26=10 - 11 kpc .",
    "an even more interesting clue found by these authors is that the [ @xmath13/fe ] ratios of these stars reach about + 0.1 to + 0.2 dex .",
    "this is just the characteristics of the most metal - poor thin disc stars in the solar neighbourhood sample , which also show this slight increase in [ @xmath13/fe ] .",
    "finally , we note that carney et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and yong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the gradient in metallicity and [ @xmath13/fe ] flattens beyond r@xmath26=10 - 11 kpc , which may explain why the metal - poor thin disc stars found in local samples are limited to about [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.6 dex .",
    "taking these considerations into account , it might then be expected that the thin disc starts forming its stars ( at solar galactocentric radius ) not at -0.6 dex , but at a higher metallicity which fig .",
    "13 suggest might be around -0.2 dex , or above .",
    "this is also consistent with the ( [ @xmath13/fe ] , [ fe / h ] ) plot in reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which , showing excellently the separation between the thin and thick discs , also shows that the tip of the metal rich thick disc is around ( -0.3,-0.2 ) dex .",
    "this leaves the possibility that there is a gap in [ @xmath13/fe ] between the thin disc and the thick disc ( pagel 2001 ) of the order of + 0.05 dex , consistent with a temporal gap between the two populations .",
    "a jump in [ @xmath13/fe ] with no significant variation of the general metal content ( @xmath20.1 dex ) does not require exchange of gas ( inflow or outflow ) but simply that star formation ceased for a period of time sufficiently long that the ism was enriched in iron by sneia for [ @xmath13/fe ] to decrease by 0.05 dex .      in view of what has just been said about the thick disc , how do we interpret the fit between the dwarf metallicity distribution and the closed - box model ?",
    "we can not eliminate the option that the thick disc is an accreted population , since there is by now no clear - cut evidence against this solution . in this eventuality",
    "however , we note that the metallicity distribution would then have to be limited to pure thin disc , solar radius stars . limiting the sample to objects born within a restricted range around this radius",
    "would probably make the metallicity much thinner than the one derived in haywood ( 2001 ) - probably less than 0.1 dex dispersion .",
    "casuso & beckman ( 2004 ) have explicitely considered the thick disc should not be part of the metallicity distribution , although not formally considering the thick disc as a population of extragalactic origin .",
    "their conclusion that infall should be an increasing function of time , is not surprising .    in the case",
    "that the thick disc is a genuine galactic population , the disc ( thin + thick ) metallicity distribution is not in marked disagreement with the closed - box model .",
    "the problem is reminiscent of the discussion about the mdf ( metallicity distribution function ) of the halo . according to predictions of hierarchical clustering in @xmath27cdm cosmologies ,",
    "the stellar halo is supposed to be an archetypal open system , formed from many independent units .",
    "however , the observed mdf of the halo is shown to be fitted reasonably well by a simple box model distribution ( oey 2003 ) over a large range of metallicities .",
    "more generally , it is apparent that the closed - box model gives a good fit to the mdf of spheroids for most of the metallicity interval .",
    "there is often a problem in fitting the metal poor tail of these distributions , but this concerns a small fraction of the stars , and is not comparable with the local disc g - dwarf problem. the question however remains : why does the closed box model provides an honest fit to these systems ?",
    "the question for the disc mdf is more or less the same .",
    "the exact profile of the low metallicity tail of the thick disc is unknown , but globally , the simple model provides a fair fit to the observed distribution .",
    "because discs are now conceived as open systems that build up continuously from accreted gas , this result is not expected .",
    "we emphasized that strictly speaking , our result only means that the allegated mismatch between the observed mdf and the simple model can not be used as an argument for infall models .",
    "it does not imply infall is not a crucial ingredient in models , although it strongly suggests that standard infall models should be revised .",
    "we notice that first results from chemo - dynamical models ( brook et al . 2005 ) are encouraging .",
    "in particular , brook et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have come quite close to reproducing the characteristics of the distinct ( @xmath13-element ) chemical signatures of the thin and thick discs , with the thick disc formed during a merging phase of gas - rich building block , while the thin disc forms inside - out , at a more quiescent epoch , from continuously accreting gas .",
    "the interesting point is given by inspection of the metallicity distribution of the ( thin + thick ) disc generated by their model ( martel et al .",
    ", 2005 , their fig .",
