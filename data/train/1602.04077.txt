    "although the mechanism of dust alignment is still inconclusive , the standard theories suggest that the long axes of anisotropic dust grains are aligned perpendicular to the magnetic ( b- ) field lines ( hildebrand 1988 ; lazarian et al .",
    "since dust grains close to the spherically symmetric shape should emit less polarized light , observations of polarized dust emission may simultaneously provide information about the morphology of growing dust grains as well as the b - field orientation in circumstellar environments , which are two of the most intriguing aspects in this research field ( for more discussion see hughes et al .",

    "it is difficult for us to know the exact reason of why the observed b - segment position angles by ovro are largely offset from the results of other previous observations . presuming the offset is not due to calibration issues",
    ", we hypothesize that at @xmath13 mm , the b - segment components observed by our jvla observations at iras4a1 ( more in section [ chap_discussion ] ) already become significant . at the central @xmath11@xmath5 area , this b - segment component revealed by the long wavelengths observations shows a smaller ( i.e. closer to 10@xmath9 - 20@xmath9 ) polarization position angle than that ( @xmath160@xmath23 ) of the component which dominates the shorter wavelength observations . due to a finite synthesized beam area , the observed polarization position angles by ovro may be a result of intensity - weighted sum among b - segments in the extended lobes ( e.g. 4a1-n , 4a1-ne ) and the b - segments within the central @xmath11@xmath5 area around iras4a1 . in the case",
    "that the dominant contribution is from the central @xmath11@xmath5 area , the averaged polarization position angle may become closer to 10@xmath9 - 20@xmath9 ) . at the observed spatial scales ,",
    "a major difference between the results of the jvla and the sma polarization observations , is in spatial distribution of polarization intensity .",
    "while the observed polarization intensity at 6.9 mm is centrally peaked ( figure [ fig : jvlaiquv ] ) , the observed polarization intensity at 0.88 mm is peaked at and dominantly contributed by the two lobes northeast and southwest to iras4a1 .",
    "in fact , the observed polarization intensity appears to be avoiding the dense elongated structure connecting iras4a1 and iras4a2 ( frau et al . 2011 ; lai et al . in prep . )",
    "our tentative interpretation will be given in section [ chap_discussion ] .",
    "both the jvla and the sma observations show the higher polarization percentage towards the outer regions .",
    "previous studies show that the continuum emission at 6.9 mm is dominated by dust thermal emission ( choi et al .",
    "the polarized continuum emission at submillimeter and millimeter bands , is likely attributed to emission of the elongated dust grains which are aligned perpendicular to the interstellar b - field . in this section ,",
    "based on the interpretation given in girart et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , frau et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and kataoka et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and references therein , we discuss potential reasons that may cause the discrepancy between the polarization observations at the 6.9 mm and the 0.88 mm bands .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsub : jvlapol ] , our observational setups do not allow us to rule out the spatial variation of polarization leakage at off - center positions , although we do not expect this effect to be significant .",
    "the stokes i peak of iras4b is @xmath130@xmath5 separated from our pointing center , and was detected at s / n@xmath1100 .",
    "the non - detection of polarized emission ( i.e. 3@xmath8 limit ) from iras4b implies that the polarization leakage both before and after the removal of residual polarization leakage at its location is likely less than 3% .",
    "if we assume that the off - center component of polarization leakage scales linearly with the angular separation from the pointing center , the estimated upper limit of off - center polarization leakage component will be @xmath240.3% within the iras4a region .",
    "our target source ngc1333 iras4a is a collapsing dense molecular core . in this region , b - field is ordered on @xmath251000 au scale , aligning in the northeast - southwest direction ( attard et al .",
    "2009 ) . within the central @xmath241000 au region surrounding iras4a1 ,",
    "the b - field is pinched in the geometrically flattened accretion flow which aligns perpendicular to the large - scale b - field .",
    "in such a case , the observed polarization intensity distribution and polarization position angles at the 0.88 mm wavelength can present an hourglass geometry ( girart et al .",
    "2006 ) , where the b - field is largely bent in the accretion flow converging from @xmath11000 au to @xmath1100 au regions ; the b - field in the inner @xmath1100 au region remains parallel with the large - scale b - field if the poloidal component is dominant on small scales , but is perpendicular to the large - scale b - field if the toroidal component is dominant .",
    "the dominant emission of the 0.88 mm polarization intensity is from regions offset from the geometrically flattened accretion flow , which are northeast and southwest of iras4a1 . at 0.88 mm ,",
    "the pinched , bended b - field in the flattened accretion flow becomes significant if generating polarization images with @xmath10 distance range of @xmath2550 @xmath11 ( i.e. if filtering out the contribution from the extended envelope ; lai et al . in prep . )",
    "close to the plane of the dense accretion flow , radiation transfer models of frau et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and kataoka et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggest that the polarized emission at 0.88 mm can be nicely canceled after being integrated in the line - of - sight , which leads to the low polarization percentage and low polarization intensity in this plane .",
    "the observed lower polarization percentages ( figure [ fig : diagrams ] ) in the higher density regions are consistent with this depolarization effect ( kataoka et al . 2012 ) .",
    "for longer wavelength observations , either the effect of grain growth , or the effect of the much lower optical depth , can lead to a higher fractional contribution to the observed intensity from the dense central region ( e.g. @xmath26200 au ) , than from the @xmath11000 au scale envelope and flattened accretion flow .",
    "these are consistent with the observed higher 6.9 mm to 0.88 mm flux ratios at regions which show brighter stokes i emission .",
    "as we show in figure [ fig : diagrams ] , for regions where we detect polarized emission in the two wavelengths , the 6.9 mm to 0.88 mm flux ratios and the stokes i flux densities are correlated ; the observed polarization percentages drop rapidly with both of these quantities .",
    "the measured higher polarization percentage at longer wavelengths at the central region , and the observed centrally concentrated higher polarized intensity in the 6.9 mm observations , can be a consequence of the less serious canceling of polarized emission when integrating along the line of sight and within a finite synthesized beam .    we note that the recent jvla @xmath10@xmath122 resolution polarization observations at 8 mm and 10 mm have proposed that a toroidal b - field component may exist within the @xmath1@xmath0 vicinity of iras4a1 ( cox et al .",
    "we do not detect this toroidal b - field component .",
    "we point out that the observed peak flux density of 12.7 mjybeam@xmath7 at 6.9 mm corresponds to a brightness temperature of @xmath141 k , which is comparable to the averaged kinematic temperature at this region ( choi et al .",
    ". the 6.9 mm emission may be marginally optically thick within the central one beam area ( @xmath1@xmath0 ) at iras4a1 ; it becomes optically thin outside of this region and shows a much lower brightness temperature ( see figure [ fig : jvlastokesi ] ) . at iras4a1",
    ", the 6.9 mm polarization observations may probe the b - field in a region nearer to the protostar than what was probed by the 0.88 mm observations . due to the high optical depth ,",
    "the presented 6.9 mm , and the optical thicker 0.88 mm polarization observations may not yet probe the b - field inside the circumstellar disk in iras4a1 as seen by cox et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "we also point out that on the @xmath12000 au scale , the sma polarization observations of co j=3 - 2 have resolved the helical b - field from the wind - envelope interaction regions ( ching et al .",
    "2016 ) . the observed orientations of b - segments around 4a1-n at 6.9 mm ( figure [ fig : angle_smooth ] ) , although is deviated from the hourglass geometry , appear consistent with the helical b - field component detected in co 3 - 2 .    as a summary , we propose that the 0.88 mm polarized emission mainly traces the b - field in the extended envelope",
    ". the lower optical depth at 6.9 mm permits tracing the b - field in the inner part of the envelope , including the wind - envelope interaction regions , and the b - field closer in the @xmath1200 au scale region .",
    "the 6.9 mm emission is optically thick in the central @xmath24100 au scale region , and can not probe the b - field inside this region .",
    "our interpretation requires confirmation with additional jvla observations ( section [ chap_summary ] ) , or alma observations at 3 mm .",
    "the quantitative modeling requires the details of the spatial distribution of dust and dust opacity spectral index ( i.e. grain growth ) , the efficiency of grain alignment as a function of the localized physical environment ( density , kinematics temperature , b - field strength ) and grain size / morphology , which is beyond the scope of the present paper . tracing the distribution of large dust grains and the b - field configuration in the protostellar gas envelope",
    "may be required to understand ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking self - consistently ( zhao et al .",
    "2016 )    the observed polarization percentages at 6.9 mm and 0.88 mm can not yet be simply compared because of the different regions they probe .",
    "our observations show that the polarization percentages at 0.88 mm and 6.9 mm are decreasing with the 6.9 mm to 0.88 mm stokes i continuum flux ratio ( figure [ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "however , the significant , aforementioned depolarization effects on the observed spatial scales prohibits direct measurements of the effects of the rounding of growing dust grains ( hughes et al . 2009 , 2013 ) on @xmath27100 au scales .",
    "close to the peak , the observed lower polarization percentage at 0.88 mm than 6.9 mm ( figure [ fig : diagrams ] ) may be because of the more significant polarization canceling effect at 0.88 mm .",
    "the high optical depth at 0.88 mm may further lead to additional ( de-)polarization due to scattering ( kataoka et al . 2015 ; yang et al .",
    "we have performed jvla q band ( 6.2 - 7.5 mm ) polarization observations on the well studied class 0 yso ngc1333 iras4a .",
    "the stokes i image resolves the well known ysos iras4a1 , iras4a2 , and the two components in iras4b . towards the center of iras4a1",
    ", we detected ( at @xmath117@xmath8 ) the polarization position angles slightly different from those observed from the existing sma observations .",
    "the detected polarization percentage by jvla at 6.2 - 7.5 mm is @xmath27@xmath13% around the stokes i continuum emission peak . considering the worst case scenario that the flux is uniformly distributed in the synthesized beam of the presented q band image , the 6.9 mm polarized intensity at this central region",
    "may be spatially resolved at 3@xmath8 by 5 hours of the jvla b array configuration observations ( @xmath1@xmath28 ) .",
    "the higher resolution polarization observations to probe the b - field in the inner regions will be preferably carried out in the longer wavelength bands , to avoid the high optical depth .",
    "the detected 6.9 mm polarized continuum emission is likely tracing predominantly the aligned dust grains .",
    "owing to the complicated b - field configurations in those lines of sight , and the higher optical depth for the 0.88 mm observations , it remains difficult for us to directly measure polarization percentage as a function of frequency , without being confused with the depolarization effects .",
    "the more sensitive observations to probe polarized 6.9 mm emission on extended regions where the b - field is ordered , can avoid the depolarization effects .    to our knowledge , this is the first successful jvla observations of polarized dust emission at this frequency band .",
    "this project also becomes a pathfinder for the future alma band1 survey , which will have a similar sensitivity , but will benefit from the superior weather of the alma site .",
    "thus , our observations focus on the frontier area of observations of the polarized dust emission in the circumstellar environments , and contain an invaluable possibility of opening up a new window in synergy between jvla , alma and sma .",
