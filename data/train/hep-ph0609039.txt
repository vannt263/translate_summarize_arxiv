    "while gauge boson masses are intimately linked to broken local symmetry , no such logical connection occurs in general for fermions . in the standard model , at least some of the mass",
    "must be linked to symmetry breaking , but this is due to the fact that left- and right - handed fermions are not in the same representations .",
    "hypothetical vectorlike fermions could indeed have masses without symmetry breaking .",
    "another situation is known for the effective , sometimes called `` constituant '' mass .",
    "it is usually interpreted as a result of strong interactions leading to a breaking of chiral symmetry , and used as a model for `` dynamical symmetry breaking '' .",
    "quite another possible origin for masses is from extra dimensions . here",
    "the problem is almost the opposite .",
    "if the scales associated with extra dimensions are heavy , it is now a matter of preserving some light states .",
    "this is often realized through some form of localisation on topological singularities : domain walls in one , or vortices for two extradimensions .    in this presentation , we review two topics relating fermion masses and extra dimensions",
    ". the first aspect may seem at first a variant of fermion `` multilocalisation '' , @xcite leading to the generation of mass patterns from overlap of wave functions in extra dimensions .",
    "the scheme considered here is however much more constrained and deterministic , as the fermions are all localized in the same way on a unique topological singularity , and the overlap functions are precisely determined by the dynamics of this singularity .",
    "this work is based on the series of papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , with predictions for colliders in @xciteand recent conjectures about a light brout - englert - higgs particle in @xcite .",
    "the second part deals with another fundamental question , namely : `` how does cp ( or t ) violation enter in a fundamental theory ? '' .",
    "the main point is that cp is the natural symmetry of gauge interactions , and therefore attempts at unifying scalar couplings ( effective or not ) with gauge interactions pose the problem of breaking cp symmetry .",
    "we prove that this can occur through dimensional reduction , by the inclusion of `` hosotani loops '' ( in this case , the equivalent of wilson loops , but looping around the extra dimension ) . in a simple example",
    ", we generate cp violation from a 4 + 1 theory with only real couplings .",
    "this work is based on reference @xcite , and its generalization to include grand unified structures @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe in general terms a model evolved in collaboration with serguey troitsky and maxim libanov .",
    "full mathematical details can be found in the original papers , and we will here mainly list the salient results",
    ".    it may still be useful to start with a little history of the model .",
    "it was initially introduced by s. troitsky and m. libanov in a different form , possibly lighter in field content , but with only approximate symmetry .",
    "@xcite , using a vortex of winding number 3 . the following version , still formulated for flat extra dimensions , simulated this vortex with a scalar field of winding number one ( with cubic coupling to fermions , and avoided any explicit breaking of symmetry by introducing supplementary scalar fields.@xcite    in both cases , the first rationale for the use of a topological defect ( the vortex ) was to confine the fermions to a small region of the extra - dimensional space , taken otherwise to be flat and infinite .",
    "the vortex being built out of a scalar field @xmath0 and an auxiliary gauge field @xmath1 ( both unrelated to the standard model fields , these fields do nt enter directly the currently observable phenomenology ) , it is possible to apply the index theorem , and to conclude that for an effective winding number @xmath2 exactly @xmath2 massless chiral fermion modes persist in the remaining 3 + 1 dimensions for each fermion field coupling to the 6-d structure .",
    "we have thus developed the phenomenology from this onset , but soon realized that the flat and unbounded extra dimensions represented a liability , with the need of confining the observed gauge fields , which otherwise could couple to fermionic modes outside the structure .",
    "a more involved version , largely with the same characteristics , was thus developed with the extra dimensions now assuming spherical topology .",
    "why maintain the topological singularity ?",
    "part of the answer lies of course in the counting of light ( massless at compactification scale ) fermion modes , and the resulting replication as an origin to the very notion of particle families .",
    "obviously , the number of light fermions is not a direct prediction of the model in its present state , as we have to put in by hand the winding number , but the mass hierarchy of fermions , and a number of phenomenological implications are quite generic .",
    "we will detail them somewhat now .",
    "while the latest formulation has the extra dimensions on a sphere , we will for pedagogical reasons describe the situation for a plane .",
    "the outcome in terms of fermion wave functions , selection rules and masses is very similar .",
    "for the plane , the extra variables are chosen as @xmath3 , while for the sphere ( of radius @xmath4 ) we use @xmath5 . assuming the above - mentioned vortex structure is described by a field @xmath0 such that @xmath6 this of course has only winding number 1 , but the winding number 3 structure is achieved by coupling all the fermion fields according to : @xmath7    this coupling may look surprising , as it is obviously non - renormalisable in 4 dimensions .",
    "we are not considering renormalisability of the theory here , as the 6 dimensional context is most likely an effective model , but even in this case it might be suitable that the 4-dim reduction be renormalisable . in this context",
    ", the reason we proceed as above is mostly simplicity : we could obviously replace this structure with a winding-3 solution for a fundamental field @xmath8 , and find similar solutions for the couplings which will follow .",
    "this would however unnecessarily clutter the discussion , and we opt at this point for the simplicity of the field content .",
    "the yukawa coupling in equation is only responsible for linking the fermions to the vortex . for each type of fermion field @xmath9 introduced . here",
    "the type @xmath10 represents the various quarks , @xmath11 or the leptons and the indices @xmath12 refer to the 4-dim chirality of the associated particles after dimensional reduction .",
    "only one field is introduced to represent all the `` up '' quarks , for instance .",
    "the vortex structure leads , through the index theorem to 3 massless localized chiral solutions in 3 + 1 dimensions , which we will associate with the family replication .",
    "typically , we have    @xmath13    what is important here is that each `` family '' of solutions has a different `` winding '' behaviour in the variable @xmath14 .",
    "the labeling of the modes is quite arbitrary ; it was chosen here so that in the simplest case the larger mass is associated to the third generation . rather than analytic expressions",
    ", we give a pictorial representation of the radial dependence of the corresponding functions @xmath15 .",
    "the fermionic mode 3 is non - vanishing at @xmath16 , with the modes behaving near the origin as : @xmath17    we have thus realized a situation similar to , but much more constrained than the multilocalisation in 5 dimensions . here",
    ", we do nt have the freedom to place our various families at arbitrary spacing , but are faced instead with non - trivial overlaps fixed by the vortex properties .",
    "this far , we only dealt with the `` background '' of the problem , and generated essentially massless states in 3 + 1 dimensions . now comes the time to generate the `` usual '' fermion masses , and to break the @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "this is done in the usual way , through the brout - englert - higgs mechanism , at the price of introducing a scalar doublet , which we will name @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , for the purpose of separating the various quantum numbers , we write , instead of the usual coupling :    @xmath20    where @xmath0 is the background field already described , while @xmath21 is a singlet with non - vanishing value at @xmath16 and winding number 0 .",
    "the reason for introducing these couplings and @xmath21 itself , is to simplify the breaking structure ; it would be perfectly possible to introduce single fields to replace the combinations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , similar terms obtain for the other fermion types .",
    "the @xmath19 field also couples to @xmath0 , and this results in a non - trivial profile , centered at the origin , and exemplified in figure[all ] .",
    "note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26      the reduction to 4 dimensions involves integration over @xmath14 and @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 in the case of a sphere ) and generates the mass terms ( we just give the `` up '' quark as an example , and neglect the term in @xmath29 for the time being ) : @xmath30 clearly , the integration over @xmath14 guarantees that only diagonal entries occur , and the ratio of the masses is given by the overlap between the fermion and scalar wave functions in the coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "if , for instance , the profile of the scalar combination is concentrated close to the origin ( as suggested in figure [ all ] ) , we get @xmath31 ( more on this later ) .",
    "mixing is however needed , and it can be introduced by the term proportional to @xmath32 in equation .",
    "this results in a mass matrix    @xmath33    the mass eigenstates are obtained by diagonalization , but the kobayashi - maskawa matrix itself finds its origin in the differential rotation of the `` up '' and `` down '' quarks . that these rotations are different can result from different choices of @xmath34 .",
    "the possibility also exists to use completely different patterns , for instance choosing the @xmath35 contribution as leading ( which we are free to do , since the yukawa couplings are arbitrary ) leads to a completely off - diagonal mass matrix , a feature which can come in handy when dealing with the large rotations between neutrinos and charged leptons .",
    "we turn now to the gauge interactions , and to their effect in 3 + 1 diemnsions . as usual",
    ", we will need to face a number of kaluza - klein excitations for each gauge boson introduced . in the present case , each such `` tower ''",
    "carries a double label , since it must refer both to radial and angular excitations .",
    "generically , ( @xmath36 stands for any gauge boson , @xmath37 , w , z , gluons ) : @xmath38    the lowest state ( massless before symmetry breaking ) has a flat profile in both variables , which guarantees charge universality on one hand , and diagonal couplings ( even in the mass basis ) for the neutral bosons .",
    "mass relations between the @xmath39 modes depend on the topology of the model .",
    "we will focus in this section on a particular feature of our approach , namely the presence of flavour - changing neutral currents , but with approximate conservation of `` family number '' . indeed , even if we neglect the kobayashi - maskawa mixing , the @xmath40 modes generate transitions between families . winding number ( @xmath14 dependence )",
    "acts as an effective `` family number '' , which is conserved at both vertices where an excitation @xmath41 connects to the fermions .",
    "for instance , the @xmath42 boson excitations @xmath43 , allow the following transitions : @xmath44    as discussed in @xcite , this leads to powefull constraints .",
    "in particular , the second process above induces the transition @xmath45 , which is severely constrained experimentally .",
    "the strength of the interaction is given by the usual gauge coupling constant , the mass of the @xmath46 excitation , and an extra factor due to the overlap of the wave functions for fermions of the first and second generation , and the radial dependence of the @xmath46 : @xmath47 , leading to the limit : @xmath48    future tests of this model will benefit much from currently planned precision lepton flavour violation experiments at moderate energies , as well as collider experiments trying to produce directly the kaluza - klein excitations .",
    "we expect mainly two types manifestations at colliders :    * the brout - englert - higgs boson mass * production of the kaluza - klein excitations .",
    "the first issue is tackled in @xcite , where a connection between the mass of @xmath19 and the extension of the scalar wave function in the extra coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "as already specified , large mass ratios @xmath49 require that the wave function be quite concentrated close to the origin .",
    "for the simplest scheme discussed above , @xcite gets an upper bound close to the current limit .",
    "the second issue deals with direct production of kaluza - klein excitations . as seen from equation , there is here a trade - off between the overlap factor and the actual mass of the new gauge boson .",
    "constraints from k meson decays put the mass range above in the ( unlikely ) case that the overlap factor @xmath50 is close to 1 .",
    "this is clearly out of reach of lhc , but a smaller overlap may bring the scale down considerably , albeit at the cost of production efficiency ( thus requiring the full luminosity for detection ) .",
    "we have studied this production as a function of @xmath50 , assuming the bound on @xmath51 to be saturated in each case ; in @xcite , we see that for an integrated luminosity of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , a few events can be expected if @xmath54 in the @xmath55 final mode ( the charge - conjugate channel is less sensitive ) .",
    "note however that this is an exceptionally clean final state to look for !",
    "considerably more events are expected if we deal with the kaluza - klein excitations of the gluons instead , but there , even if the family - number near conservation still obtains , the extraction of the signal will be considerably more difficult , and detailed modeling is requested .",
    "the motivation for this work was given already in the introduction : if a fundamental theory has all couplings related to gauge interactions , how can it violate the natural symmetry of those , i.e. , cp ?",
    "one possibility is to have _ spontaneous _ cp violation , involving several , relatively complex vacuum expectation values .",
    "this is certainly possible , requires at least 3 such vev s , but can appear somewhat contrived .",
    "we look here for a more structural approach .",
    "we start with a simple example , showing how a complex mass matrix can arise from a purely real lagrangian in 5 + 1 dimensions .",
    "basically two choices are possible for the definition of parity : either flip all the spatial coordinates , ( central inversion ) , or only one ( specular reflection ) . for an odd number of spatial dimensions , they are equivalent ( up to a rotation ) , but not for an even number . in this case , the central inversion is part of the rotation group , while the specular reflection stays an extra operation .",
    "it turns out that the symmetry we are really concerned with here ( and which enters the cpt theorem , with a corresponding definition of c ) is the latter .",
    "a somewhat surprising fact is that , in 4 + 1 dimensions , the simple lagrangian : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is already p - violating . this is unfamiliar , and will need a word of explanation , which will prove the key to the cp breaking mechanism .",
    "if we go back to 3 + 1 dimensions , we note that the two expressions @xmath58 are related by a chiral transformation , or more simply by the allowed change @xmath59 there is no fundamental difference here between scalar and pseudoscalr couplings , and the simultaneous presence of both `` scalar '' and `` pseudoscalar '' independent terms is requested to have parity violation in ( 3 + 1 ) dim .",
    "this is not the case in 4 + 1 dimensions , since we can no longer consider independently @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , but need to deal with the full 4-component spinor grouping both .",
    "seen otherwise , the presence of @xmath62 in the kinetic term effectively forbids the transformation .      returning to",
    ", we note that afer singling out one extra dimension ( typically , @xmath63 ) , we will generate terms of the type : @xmath64 where @xmath65 may originate either from the derivative or the @xmath66 term .",
    "such terms lead directly to a complex mass , even if the original scalar couplings ( m ) were all real .",
    "now , of course two objections are in order .",
    "the first deals with the observability of this complex coupling , namely would it imply cp violation in 3 + 1 dimensions ?",
    "we know the answer to this question is negative , as a chiral transformation can be used to rotate the phase away . in presence of other interactions , like qcd , this would however contribute to the @xmath67 term .",
    "we will return to this in the next section , as the obvious answer is to enlarge the gauge group we consider ( what we have here corresponds only to qed ! ) .",
    "the second objection deals with the gauge invariance of the procedure .",
    "if indeed @xmath65 is related to the vacuum expectation value of a field , like @xmath68 , the statement is not gauge invariant .",
    "the answer to the second objection is of course straightforward , and one has to introduce either the line integral ( for unbounded space ) or the loop integral ( for compact space ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the extra dimension . in the case of a closed loop ,",
    "this is just a wilson loop .",
    "it can be thought of ( if we imbed the loop in an unphysical plane ) as the flux of @xmath36 across the ( unphysical ) surface spanned by the loop .",
    "alternatively , if we are dealing with a segment or orbifold structure , @xmath66 can still be gauged away , but at the cost of introducing non-(anti-)periodical boundary conditions induced by : @xmath71    the use of such a line integral to introduce symmetry breaking has been investigated extensively by hosotani @xcite , @xcitein the framework of dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "we now turn to the simplest possible case of a working cp violation model along the lines sketched above . for this purpose",
    ", we use a fermion doublet , interacting with an @xmath72 gauge group according to : @xmath73 and assume the hosotani loop ( seen here as a kind of boundary condition ) :",
    "@xmath74    this generates a mass matrix @xmath75 the phases can be rotated away by a gauge transformation , but this leads to complex coefficients at the charged @xmath76 vertices , leading to an effective `` @xmath77-dipole moment '' through the graph shown in figure 2 .",

    ", the index theorem shows that for each 4 + 1-d fermion , we get only one localized chiral mode in 3 + 1 ; the chirality ( l or r ) depending on the sign of the coupling between the scalar representing the domain wall ( the presence of the latter is ensured by suitable boundary conditions ) . by choosing the scalar responsible for the topological singularity to be part of a larger gauge group",
    ", we can in fact obtain both chiralities from a single representation : imagine for instance an octet of such background scalars under su(3 ) breaking with vev in the direction @xmath83 , and coupled to a triplet of fermions .",
    "the details of such mechanism become quite intricate , and can be found in @xcite where we propose semi - realistic models , endowed with non - trivial mass matrices and chiral fermions .",
    "a complete picture finds its natural expression in the context of grand unified theories . in this case",
    ", we have shown that the first usable unification group is @xmath84 ( rather than the usual @xmath85 or @xmath86 ) .",
