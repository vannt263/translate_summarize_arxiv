    "hadron physics explores the least understood sector of the standard model ( sm ) , namely quantumchromodynamics ( qcd ) at large gauge coupling . in the region of energies below a few gev ,",
    "one is faced with two different types of challenges :    _ precision calculations / measurements : _ many very precise data exist which let one extract fundamental qcd parameters ( condensates , quark masses , etc . ) or explore bounds for physics beyond the sm . in such cases , precision calculations to accuracies of a few percent or better",
    "have to be done , which in certain cases can be achieved utilizing effective field theory techniques .",
    "however , it should be stressed that contrary to popular opinion , more such precise data are needed , e.g. in processes involving strange quarks .",
    "space does not allow to discuss these very interesting developments here .    _",
    "the spectrum : _ to really understand the issue of confinement in the light quark sector , we must first bring order into the spectrum .",
    "the nature and the spectrum of hadrons can only be understood if we are able to say with certainty which states are genuine quark model states , which are dynamically generated through channel couplings or which ones are exotic .",
    "for that , precise measurements of many properties of these states are needed and theoretical tools have to be developed to separate the often overlapping resonances . in this talk , i will address two topics related to this type of problems , which are a ) some properties of the exotic @xmath0 ( the so - called pentaquark ) and b ) the way to achieve a unified description of resonances . clearly , this choice is very subjective , so many other interesting developments and/or challenges could not be discussed .",
    "the parity of the recently discovered exotic state @xmath0 with positive strangeness is not yet determined @xcite ( i refer to the various plenary talks given at this conference for a detailed discussion on the various experiments and possible criticism as well as on theoretical approaches ) .",
    "its parity is considered a decisive quantity regarding its substructure .",
    "the most appealing proposal to determine the parity is based on the application of the pauli principle in the process @xmath1 @xcite since it links spin and parity . in @xcite",
    "the spin correlation coefficient @xmath2 was identified as the crucial observable since in the low - energy region its sign is directly related to parity of the @xmath3 , see fig .  1 and also table  1 ( assuming that the @xmath3 has spin 1/2 ) . due to the self - analyzing hyperon decay",
    ", the energy dependence of spin transfer coefficient @xmath4 might also be used to determine @xmath5 ( under certain favorable conditions ) , cf .",
    "again table  1 ( where the threshold values / ranges are given ) . in these arguments",
    ", one assumes naturalness of the contributing partial waves , in particular for the s - waves that dominate the region of small excess energy @xmath6 .    in @xcite",
    "are more detailed study of these proposals was performed , in particular , models were constructed were the leading s - waves are suppressed due to cancellations , thus explicitely violating the naturalness assumption .",
    "still , it was shown that the energy dependence of @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the unpolarized cross section , guarantees unambiguous information on the parity of the @xmath3 .",
    "this can be achieved e.g. by measurements at two @xmath6-values , say at 20 and 40  mev , to avoid the coulomb effects at smaller excess energies but still staying sufficiently close to threshold . for a more detailed discussion ( in particular the the usefulness of the quantity @xmath9 ) and more references on this issue",
    ", please consult @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of the @xmath3 is its width .",
    "most experiments which have seen evidence of this state only quote upper limits for the width given by the resolution of the experiment .",
    "for example , the fairly clean signal in proton - proton collisions reported by the cosy - tof collaboration @xcite gives @xmath10 due to the energy resolution .",
    "in various papers , information on kaon ",
    "nucleon scattering @xcite was analyzed leading to the conclusion that the width of the @xmath3 has to be less than a few mev . a strongly interacting particle with such a small width",
    "could truly be called `` exotic '' . in @xcite",
    "the impact of the pentaquark on differential and integrated cross sections for the reaction @xmath11 , where experimental information is available at kaon momenta below 640 mev ( the mass range of 1520 to 1555  mev corresponds to kaon momenta in the range @xmath12  mev ) , was investigated .",
    "the calculation utilizes the jlich kaon - nucleon model ( see @xcite and references therein ) and an extension of it that includes the contribution of a @xmath0 with a variable width .",
    "the evaluation of the reaction @xmath11 takes into account effects due to the fermi motion of the nucleons within the deuteron and three  body kinematics .    as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "one concludes from that analysis that the data constrain the width of the @xmath0 to be less than 1  mev . in @xcite , the reaction @xmath13 was investigated in a meson - exchange model including rescattering of the secondary protons with the aim to analyze the evidence for the @xmath0 reported by the diana collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that the kinematical cuts introduced by the diana collaboration efficiently suppress the background to the @xmath14 reaction which may contribute to the @xmath3 production .",
    "these kinematical cuts do not produce a narrow structure in the @xmath15 effective mass spectrum near 1540 mev , cf .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "the effect of a narrow resonance with both positive and negative parity in comparison to the diana data was studied in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath13 calculations without @xmath3 contribution as well as the results obtained with a @xmath3 width of 1  mev are in comparably good agreement with the diana results , see fig .",
    "the @xmath16/dof is @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for no @xmath3 , a positive and a negative parity spin-1/2 pentaquark with a width of 1  mev , in order ( with the cuts applied to the @xmath20 invariant mass spectrum ) . in view of these results ,",
    "the three star rating for the @xmath3 in the recent pdg tables seems somewhat optimistic @xcite .",
    "more dedicated experiments are called for to establish ( or rule out ) this exotic baryon resonance .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "this section first presents some results on the baryon spectrum ( for definiteness , a few states are selected to make the point ) using two very different approaches . in the second more speculative part",
    "some ideas are presented how one could unify these approaches and eventually gain a deeper insight into the confinement regime of qcd .",
    "the quark model has been particularly successful in bringing order into the many observed meson and baryon resonances . in the last years , it has become evident that a covariant framework is necessary to deal with _ all _ the ( ir)regularities found in the hadron spectrum .",
    "here , i will focus on the baryon resonances and pick one particular covariant quark model , in which the residual interaction of the constituent quarks are a flavor - dependent instanton induced interaction and a linear confinement potential ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach leads to a fairly good description of the spectrum , including states with very high spin and is consistent with regge phenomenology .",
    "the t hooft interaction also explains the near degeneracy of many positive and negative parity states @xcite , which is very different from the speculations about chiral restauration in the hadron spectrum at masses above @xmath21gev which one finds frequently in the current literature .",
    "many electroweak observables @xcite and heavy quark properties have also been successfully calculated .",
    "strong pion decays come out typically a factor two too small , but the overall pattern of pion couplings is well described since @xcite the so - called `` missing resonances '' have couplings that are at least an order of magnitude smaller than for the states that couple with normal strength to the pion - nucleon continuum .",
    "just to be precise , in this approach the @xmath22 , the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 are three ",
    "quark states @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath22 is not well described in this approach , pointing towards the bound - state scenario discussed below .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of this model , one also generates a whole zoo of states with quark content @xmath25 , some of them exotic and many of them with conventional quantum numbers , which also has to be kept in mind in the discussion of the pentaquark @xmath3 - there simply can not just be one state like that , there must be many ( so far one experiment has a hint for another exotic baryon from the anti - decuplet @xcite ) .",
    "[ for a different modern quark model , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "next , i discuss how hyperon resonances can be generated as meson - baryon bound states .",
    "for that , consider @xmath26 scattering .",
    "a purely perturbative treatment is not possible due to the strong channel couplings and the appearance of a subthreshold resonance , the @xmath22 .",
    "a non - perturbative resummation scheme is mandatory to generate a bound state or a resonance .",
    "there exist many such approaches , but it is possible and mandatory to link such a scheme tightly to the chiral qcd dynamics .",
    "such an improved approach was developed for pion ",
    "nucleon @xcite and later applied to @xmath27n scattering  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the t ",
    "matrix for any partial wave , which can be represented in closed form if one neglects for the moment the crossed channel ( left - hand ) cuts , @xmath28\\,$ ] , with @xmath29 the cm energy .",
    "@xmath30 collects all local terms and poles and @xmath31 is the meson - baryon loop function ( the fundamental bubble ) that is resummed by e.g. dispersion relations in a way to exactly recover the right - hand ( unitarity ) cut contributions .",
    "the function @xmath31 needs regularization , this can be best done in terms of a subtracted dispersion relation and using dimensional regularization .",
    "it is important to ensure that in the low - energy region , the so constructed t ",
    "matrix agrees with the one of chpt ( matching ) .",
    "in addition , one has to recover the contributions from the left - hand cut .",
    "this can be achieved by a hierarchy of matching conditions , which enforce that to a given order in the chiral expansion , the unitarized amplitude agrees with the chpt amplitude ( eventually in some unphysical region ) .",
    "such a procedure tightly constrains the unitarization procedure , for details see @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that there are indeed two poles close to the nominal @xmath22 resonance .",
    "the physics behind these two poles was recently revealed in @xcite .",
    "starting from an su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian to couple the meson octet to the baryon octet ( in that limit , all octet goldstone boson masses and all octet baryon masses are equal ) , one could in principle generate a variety of resonances according to the su(3 ) decomposition , @xmath32 . as it turns out ,",
    "the leading order transition potential is attractive only in the singlet and the two octet channels , so that one a priori expects a singlet and two octets of bound states .",
    "however , the two octets come out degenerate .",
    "this has no particular dynamical origin but rather is a consequence of the actual values of the su(3 ) structure constants . in the real world , there is of course su(3 ) breaking of various origins .",
    "this was parameterized in @xcite in terms of a symmetry breaking parameter @xmath33 in the expressions for the meson @xmath34 and baryon masses @xmath35 as well as the subtraction constants @xmath36 via @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath39mev , @xmath40mev and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "the motion of the various poles in the complex energy plane as a function of @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "we note that the two octets split , in particular , one moves to lower energy ( @xmath43mev ) close to the position of the singlet ( @xmath44mev ) .",
    "these are the two poles which combine to give the @xmath22 as it appears in various reactions .",
    "recent kaon photoproduction data from spring-8 seem to give support to this two - pole scenario .",
    "we note that the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 are also generated ( the latter is the right - most pole in fig .  4 ) , besides other resonances with strangeness @xmath45 , see ref .",
    "@xcite and also the extensive studies in @xcite .",
    "here , i will speculate how one can bring together the quark model and the coupled channel approach to achieve a unified description of resonances .",
    "for that , one can follow a two - step procedure , as discussed below . before going into the details , i remark that step  1 has been done ( to some extent ) whereas the second step so far is science fiction , but i consider it an important topic to be addressed in the coming years .",
    "more precisely , i envision the following :    _ step  1 : _ the coupled channel approach can be extended in that one can also include resonance fields by saturating the local contact terms in the effective lagrangian through explicit meson and baryon resonances ( for details , see @xcite ) . in particular , in this framework one can cleanly separate genuine quark resonances from dynamically generated resonance  like states .",
    "the former require the inclusion of an explicit field in the underlying lagrangian , whereas in the latter case the fit will arrange itself so that the couplings to such an explicit field will vanish .",
    "this framework was applied in @xcite to the case of pion  nucleon scattering below the @xmath46 threshold .",
    "some typical results are : 1 ) the delta pole is located at @xmath47 mev , in agreement with dispersion - theoretical studies of pion  nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction . furthermore",
    ", a genuine 3-quark component is needed to build up this state .",
    "2 ) the rho requires a quark - antiquark component , consistent with large n@xmath48 investigations and its tensor coupling comes out large , @xmath49 .",
    "3 ) no light scalar is needed to describe the data , all the interaction in the t - channel with scalar - isoscalar quantum numbers is build up by pion rescattering ( loops ) .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of other reactions , like e.g. @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 @xcite or the scalar form factor of the pion @xcite as well as the intermediate range attraction in the central part of the two  nucleon potential .",
    "_ step  2 : _ a further step would be to merge the coupled channel dynamics with quark model predictions . in fig .  5",
    "the underlying idea is sketched for the example of the strong @xmath52 transition . in a pure quark model description",
    "based e.g. on the bethe - salpeter formalism , one can only describe part of the @xmath52 decay , since there is a sizeable modification of the vertex through final state interactions ( often called `` dressing '' ) and also channel coupling ( some typical graphs are shown on the right - hand - side of that figure ) .",
    "in fact , the idea would be to use the vertices and masses generated in the quark model as input in these loop corrections .",
    "that way , the aforementioned problem of the too small strong width should be solved and one also obtains a better representation of the underlying dynamics .",
    "ultimately , this should be extended to many channels so as to achieve a truly unified description of the spectrum of the strongly interacting particles and their properties .",
    "to come back to the hyperon states discussed before , such a scheme would allow one to really pin down the nature of these states , my guess is that while the @xmath24 and the @xmath53 are dominantly three - quark states , the @xmath22 will not have a three - quark component but simply be a dynamically generated state with different response to external probes and decay patterns . to end this section ,",
    "i should point out that such ideas are not entirely new , but in my opinion only now the theoretical tools have become available to seriously tackle this problem .",
    "i would like to stress again that hadron structure and dynamics is one of the central issues of qcd ( of the standard model ) and require non  perturbative methods in the few gev region and below .",
    "apart from the topics discussed before , there are many further challenges related to ( i just name a few ) :    * lattice qcd and chiral extrapolations .",
    "most lattice data are obtained for large unphysical values of the quark ( pion ) masses and thus must be interpolated by means of chiral perturbation theory to the physical value of @xmath54 . on the example of the nucleon mass ,",
    "the possible loopholes and limitations of such methods are discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is evident that for pion masses larger than 500  mev , chiral extrapolations cease to be useful .",
    "+ * as noted in the introduction , precision hadronic calculations are needed to e.g. really be able to address the issue whether physics beyond the sm has been seen in the precise bnl measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite ( my guess would be not ) or if one wants to precisely test ckm unitarity in b - decays .",
    "another recent example are the radiative corrections to tritium @xmath55-decay @xcite to reduce the upper limit on the ( electron ) neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are some real puzzles when comparing precision data to precision calculations . as an example , in fig .  6 a calculation of the ground - state energy shift and width of",
    "kaonic hydrogen @xcite compared to earlier measurements @xcite and the recent result from dear @xcite is shown .",
    "as the only input , the s - wave scattering length combination @xmath56 was taken from the dispersive analysis of martin @xcite and from the unitarized chpt analysis of @xcite . in both cases , the theoretical prediction ( filled boxes )",
    "is in stark disagreement with the dear result . at present",
    ", this discrepancy is unexplained .",
    "* there has been impressive progress made in nuclear effective field theory .",
    "in particular , two- and three - nucleon forces can be described in one consistent scheme . by now , the nucleon ",
    "nucleon force has been worked out to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order in the eft expansion @xcite and has reached the accuracy needed to do precise calculations in few - nucleon systems .",
    "other advances in this field concern the quark mass dependence of light nuclei @xcite and the speculation of an infrared renormalization group limit cycle in qcd @xcite . for many other applications , in particular low energy reactions of relevance for astrophysics and element synthesis , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
