    "we are concerned in this paper with algebraic properties of the group of @xmath1 homeomorphisms of a @xmath1 manifold , fixed on some @xmath1 submanifold ( usually of codimension 1 or 2 , for instance the boundary ) and some of its subgroups ( usually those preserving some structure ) .",
    "the most important case is the group of @xmath1 homeomorphisms of @xmath2 fixed pointwise on @xmath3 ; hence these are `` groups of pl homeomorphisms of the ( @xmath0-)cube '' .",
    "the _ algebraic _ study of transformation groups ( often in low dimension , or preserving some extra structure such as a symplectic or complex structure ) has recently seen a lot of activity ; however , much of this activity has been confined to the smooth category .",
    "it is striking that many of these results can be transplanted to the @xmath1 category .",
    "this interest is further strengthened by the possibility of working in the @xmath1 category over ( real ) algebraic rings or fields ( this possibility has already been exploited in dimension 1 , in the groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 of richard thompson ) .",
    "many theorems we prove have analogs in the ( @xmath6 ) smooth category , and we usually give proofs of such theorems for comparison where they are not already available in the literature .      the main algebraic properties of our groups that we establish are _ left orderability _ ( in fact , local indicability ) and _ controlled distortion_. these are algebraic properties which at the same time are readily compared with geometric or topological properties of a group action .",
    "for example , the property of left orderability for a countable group is _ equivalent _ to the existence of a faithful action on @xmath7 by homeomorphisms . as another example ,",
    "control of ( algebraic ) distortion has recently been used by hurtado @xcite to prove strong rigidity results for homomorphisms between various ( smooth ) transformation groups .    in   [ section : background ] we state for the convenience of the reader standard definitions and results from the theory of left - orderable groups .",
    "in   [ section : pl_groups ] we begin our analysis of pl groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds , fixed pointwise on a codimension 1 submanifold .",
    "if @xmath8 is a pl manifold and @xmath9 a submanifold , we denote by @xmath10 the group of orientation - preserving pl homeomorphisms of @xmath8 fixed pointwise on @xmath9 .",
    "we similarly denote by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the groups of diffeomorphisms ( resp .",
    "homeomorphisms ) of a smooth ( resp .",
    "topological ) manifold @xmath8 , fixed pointwise on a smooth ( resp .",
    "topological ) submanifold @xmath9 of codimension 1 .",
    "the first main theorem of this section is :    let @xmath8 be an @xmath0 dimensional connected @xmath1 manifold , and let @xmath9 be a nonempty closed @xmath1 submanifold of codimension at most 1",
    ". then the group @xmath10 is left orderable ; in fact , it is locally indicable .",
    "we give some basic constructions of interesting groups of pl homeomorphisms of cubes ( of dimension at least 2 ) fixed pointwise on the boundary , including examples of free subgroups , groups with infinite dimensional spaces of ( dynamically defined ) quasimorphisms , and right - angled artin groups ; in fact , the method of funar , together with a recent result of kim and koberda shows that every raag embeds in @xmath13 .",
    "we conclude this section by studying distortion in @xmath14 , and prove    every element of @xmath15 is at most exponentially distorted .",
    "this lets us easily construct explicit examples of locally indicable groups which are not isomorphic to subgroups of @xmath14 for any @xmath16 ( for example , iterated hnn extensions ) .    in ",
    "[ section : smooth ] we prove theorem  [ theorem : cilo ] , the analog of theorem  [ theorem : pillow ] for groups of @xmath6 smooth diffeomorphisms .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to compare and contrast the methods of proof in the pl and smooth categories .    in   [ section : biorderable ] we sharpen our focus to the question of bi - orderability ( i.e. orders which are invariant under both left and right multiplication ) , for transformation groups acting on cubes in various dimensions and with differing degrees of analytic control . in dimensions bigger than 1 ,",
    "none of the groups we study are bi - orderable . in dimension 1 , the groups @xmath17 and @xmath18 are bi - orderable .    in   [ section :",
    "circular ] we consider groups acting on manifolds and fixing pointwise submanifolds ( informally , `` knots '' ) of codimension two .",
    "here we are able to bootstrap our results from previous sections to show the following :    let @xmath8 be an @xmath0 dimensional connected @xmath1 orientable manifold , and let @xmath9 be a nonempty @xmath19 dimensional closed submanifold",
    ". then the group @xmath10 is circularly orderable .",
    "an analog for @xmath6 diffeomorphisms is also proved .",
    "an interesting application is to the case that @xmath8 is a 3-manifold , and @xmath9 is a hyperbolic knot ( i.e. a knot with a hyperbolic complement ) . in this case , if @xmath20 denotes the group of pl homeomorphisms ( or @xmath6 diffeomorphisms ) isotopic to the identity and taking @xmath9 to itself ( but _ not _ necessarily fixing it pointwise ) then @xmath20 is left - orderable .",
    "this depends on theorems of hatcher and ivanov on the topology of @xmath20 as a topological group .",
    "finally , in   [ section : finite ] we briefly discuss groups of homeomorphisms with no analytic restrictions . our main point is how little is known in this generality in dimension @xmath21 ; in particular , it is not even known if the group @xmath22 is left - orderable .",
    "we also make the observation that the groups @xmath23 are torsion - free for all @xmath0 ; this follows immediately from smith theory , but the result does not seem to be well - known to people working on left - orderable groups , so we believe it is useful to include an argument here .",
