    "understanding the cosmological evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is an important issue in modern astrophysics and is closely related to the evolution of galaxies .",
    "one piece of evidence for  co - evolution \" of agns and galaxies is the strong correlation between a central black hole and its host galaxy ( e.g. , magorrian et al . 1998",
    "; marconi & hunt 2003 ) . in an early stage of galaxy evolution , the nuclear region may be hidden behind rich gas , which leads to active star formation .",
    "indeed recent models predict that the central black holes in all galaxies experience a heavily obscured phase ( hopkins et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) . therefore",
    ", investigating obscured agns is of significant interest to study the co - evolution of black holes and galaxies .",
    "moreover , previous observations have shown that obscured agns are a major population of the agn .",
    "finally , obscured agn are predicted to be the main contributors to the unexplained cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) in the hard x - rays ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; gilli et al .",
    "thus , obscured agn population is a key class to understand the overall agn population , agn evolution , and relationship between black holes and their hosts .    according to a unified model of the agn ,",
    "obscuring matter referred to as a `` torus '' is surrounding a supermassive black hole and gas photoionized by the agn is created in the opening part of the torus ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "if we observe an agn from the torus side , absorbed direct emission from the nucleus and emission scattered by the photoionized gas are observed in the x - ray spectra .",
    "a scattering fraction is calculated as the fraction of the scattered emission with respect to the direct emission and reflects the solid angle of the opening part of the torus and/or an amount of gas responsible for scattering .",
    "_ suzaku s _ follow - up observations of _ swift _ bat - detected agns found a new type of agn with a very small scattering fraction ( @xmath4 0.5% ; ueda et al . 2007 ; eguchi et al . 2009 ; winter et al .",
    "2009 ) . assuming that the amount of scattering medium does not differ much from object to object , they would be buried in a geometrically thick torus with a small opening angle .",
    "noguchi et al . ( 2009 ) found several buried agn candidates with a very small scattering fraction from the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalogue ( @xmath5 ) using hardness ratios ( hrs ) and showed that such type of agns tend to have a low relative [ ] @xmath35007 luminosity compared to the intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "this implies that the agn with a small scattering fraction could constitute the main class of optically elusive obscured agns .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a new sample of obscured agns covering a broad range of scattering fractions from @xmath5 catalogue in the same way as noguchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and investigate multi - wavelength properties of a buried agn in comparison with a classical type of agn having a large scattering fraction . in section 2 , we describe the selection method of a new sample of obscured agns that covers a broad range of scattering fractions .",
    "our results of x - ray and optical spectral analysis are briefly presented in section 3 , and their multiwavelength properties are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we adopt ( _ h_@xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) @xmath9 ( 70 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) throughout this paper .",
    "we used the @xmath5 catalogue produced by the _ xmm - newton _ survey science centre , which contains @xmath0250,000 detections drawn from @xmath03500 _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic observations made between 2000 and 2007 ( watson et al .",

    "we derived a sample that covers a wide range of scattering fractions ( @xmath00.1%@xmath110% ) from the @xmath5 catalogue using the hrs in the same way as noguchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as briefly summarized below .",
    "we used hrs defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 where cr(1.0@xmath12.0 kev ) , cr(2.0@xmath14.5 kev ) , and cr(4.5@xmath112 kev ) are count rates in the 1.0@xmath12.0 , 2.0@xmath14.5 , and 4.5@xmath112 kev bands , respectively .",

    "we excluded low - luminosity agns with the intrinsic 2@xmath110 kev luminosity lower than 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath10 and compton - thick agns with column densities of log _ n_@xmath20",
    "@xmath16 1.5@xmath1110@xmath24 @xmath13 from our sample because of the following reasons . soft x - rays of low - luminosity agns would be contributed by x - ray emission from hot gas and discrete sources in their host galaxies , and direct emission of compton - thick agns is almost completely blocked below 10 kev .",
    "therefore , scattering fractions of these classes of objects can not be calculated correctly .",
    "we analyzed x - ray spectra obtained by _ xmm - newton _ to identify compton - thick and low - luminosity agns .",
    "if an x - ray continuum spectrum above 4 kev is fitted by a pure reflection component and the equivalent width of fe - k@xmath25 with respect to the reflection component is greater than 1 kev ( matt et al . 1991 ) , we classified such objects as a compton - thick agn .",
    "the absorption corrected 2@xmath110 kev luminosities were calculated from the best - fit models obtained in the same ways as discussed in section 3.1 , and objects with the luminosity lower than 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath10 were regarded as a low - luminosity agn .",
    "objects listed as a seyfert 1 , 1.5 or a star in nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) were excluded . objects with a scattering fraction more than 10% , which was calculated from a formula described in section 4.1 , were also removed from our sample . furthermore , ngc 1052 was excluded from the sample because this object shows complicated spectrum requiring a double partial covering model , and a component absorbed by @xmath26 @xmath0 2@xmath1110@xmath27 @xmath13 is relatively strong , which makes it difficult to measure the scattering fraction .",
    "we finally selected 32 objects as members of our sample , of which 10 objects are newly selected agns and the others are included in noguchi et al .",

    "a summary of the newly selected agns and their properties is found in table [ table : sample ] .",
