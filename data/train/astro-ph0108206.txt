    "the galactic x - ray binary ss 433 is the only known astrophysical system where relativisticly red- and blue - shifted lines are observed from high z elements .",
    "lines from the h balmer series were detected by @xcite and modelled kinematically by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as emission from opposing jets emerging from the vicinity of a compact object that precesses about an axis inclined to the line of sight .",
    "the precise description of the line positions was given by @xcite : the jet velocity , v@xmath16 , is 0.260@xmath17 and its orientation precesses with a 162.5 day period in a cone with half - angle 19.85  about about an axis which is 78.83  to the line of sight .",
    "the lines from the jet are doppler shifted with this period so that the maximum redshift is about 0.15 and the maximum blueshift is about -0.08 .",
    "the x - ray source undergoes eclipses at a 13.0820 day period . assuming uniform outflow , the widths of the optical lines were used to estimate the opening angle of the jet : 5  @xcite . for more details of the optical spectroscopy ,",
    "see the review by @xcite .",
    "ss 433 has radio jets oriented at a position angle of 100  ( east of north ) which show an oscillatory pattern that can be explained by helical motion of material flowing along ballistic trajectories @xcite . using vlbi observations of ejected knots",
    ", @xcite independently confirmed the velocity of the jet and the kinematic model and also derived an accurate distance : 4.85 @xmath1 0.2 kpc , which we adopt throughout our analysis .",
    "the radio jets extend from the milliarcsec scale to several arcseconds , a physical range of @xmath18 cm from the core .",
    "the optical emission lines , however , originate in a smaller region , @xmath19 cm across , based on light travel time arguments @xcite . at the same position angle",
    "is large scale x - ray emission that extends @xmath1 30 - 35  to about @xmath20 cm @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to demonstrate that ss 433 is an x - ray source .",
    "their _ heao - a _ spectrum could be modelled as thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath21 kev and emission due to fe - k was detected near 7 kev .",
    "they also found that the x - ray luminosity , @xmath22 erg s@xmath0 , was much lower than the inferred power in kinetic energy : @xmath23 erg s@xmath0 .",
    "_ exosat _ x - ray observations showing that the 6.7 kev line appeared to shift with the precession phase were interpreted as detecting fe xxv from 10 kev gas @xcite . using _ ginga _ , @xcite concluded that @xmath24 should be 30 kev while @xcite obtained a value of 20 kev based on the ratio of fe xxv and fe xxvi line fluxes from _ asca _ observations . @xcite and @xcite developed the model that the x - ray emission originates near the base of the jets which are adiabatically expanding and cooling until @xmath24 drops to about 100 ev at which point the jet is thermally unstable .",
    "@xcite found that the redshifted fe xxv line was fainter relative to the blueshifted line , than expected from doppler intensity conservation , leading them to conclude that the redward jet must be obscured by neutral material in an accretion disk .",
    "although the _ asca _ spectra showed emission lines that were previously unobserved , the lines were not resolved spectrally and lines below 2 kev were difficult to identify .",
    "ss 433 was observed using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in order to resolve the x - ray lines , detect fainter lines than previously observed and measure lower energy lines that could not be readily detected in the _ asca _ observations . a description of the hetgs and its performance are given by @xcite",
    ". an important feature of the hetgs is that spectra are obtained independently and simultaneously using the high energy gratings ( hegs ) and the medium energy gratings ( megs ) .",
    "the hegs have @xmath25 higher spectral resolution and greater effective area above 4 kev than the megs while the megs have an extended bandpass and more effective area for detecting low energy emission lines .",
    "ss 433 was observed with the hetgs on 23 september 2000 ( jd - 2451000 .",
    "= 445.0 - 445.4 ) .",
    "the precession phase was 0.51 , based on the ephemeris determined by @xcite and the orbital phase was 0.67 using the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the telescope roll angle was set so that the dispersion direction was nearly perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the exposure time was 28676 s , determined by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of frames with detected events , @xmath28 is the acis - s frame time ( 3.241 s ) and @xmath29 is the frame shift time ( 0.041 s ) .",
    "this computation corrects for the `` readout streak '' exposure because the streak data are not included in the analysis .",
    "based on the hetgs spectral fits ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] ) , we expected to observe about 1.4 count / s in zeroth order .",
    "the average count rate in zeroth order was measured to be about 0.15 count / s , so we conclude that the image is heavily affected by pileup , given the 3.2 s frame times .",
    "briefly , pileup occurs when two or more events are detected within an event region ( 3 @xmath14 3 pixels ) in a readout or frame time .",
    "pileup has three important effects : 1 ) event energies are combined so that it is impossible to determine the energies of the original events , 2 ) the event grade ( denoting the distribution of charge among the 9 pixels ) changes and can often end up as a grade that is normally eliminated in processing , reducing the apparent count rate , and 3 ) having a highly nonlinear dependence on the local count rate , the cores of point sources are more affected than the wings so the appearance can be distorted .",
    "spectral analysis of heavily piled zeroth order data can be challenging and was deemed to be of limited value compared to the hetgs spectra .    the zeroth order image , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] , is distinctly elongated in the e - w direction . due to event pileup , we can not determine if the image matches that of a point source within 1  of the core .",
    "profiles along the e - w and n - s directions should be affected by pileup in the same way , however we find that they are clearly different , as shown in fig .  [ fig:1dprofiles ] : there are `` shoulders '' to the e - w profile that do not appear in the n - s profile . again , these profiles are difficult to compare to point source models due to the nonlinear effects of pileup , so these one - dimensional profiles are most useful only for comparing to each other .",
    "we associate the excess emission in the e - w direction with the arcsec - scale radio jet , as observed by @xcite using the vla .",
    "a radial profile of the extended emission was computed by determining the counts in two e - w azimuthal sectors and subtracting normalized profiles using the remaining n - s azimuths .",
    "the profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radialprofile ] .",
    "this method nulls the point source , so the 1  bin centered on the source shows no significant excess flux .",
    "extended flux is detected 1 - 2  from the core and drops rapidly with distance from the image centroid until it is undetectable beyond 6 .",
    "we estimate that the total count rate from the extended jets is about 0.008 @xmath1 0.0005 count / s , accounting for about 0.6% of the flux within 5  of the source centroid .",
    "a set of cross dispersion profiles were derived for continuum regions and for several line regions of the dispersed spectrum . for comparison ,",
    "profiles for the same wavelength regions were determined from a point - like calibration source , pks  2155304 ( observation i d 1705 ) .",
    "the profiles are indistinguishable from each other and are consistent with that of the point source .",
    "thus , we conclude that the most of the emission lines and the continuum originate from the same region on a scale of @xmath30 1 .",
    "the extended , elongated emission detected in the zeroth order image would not be discernable in the cross dispersion profiles at the same low fractional power due to the slight astigmatism of the grating optics in the cross dispersion direction .",
    "the spectral data were reduced starting from level 1 data provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) using idl custom processing scripts ; the method is quite similar to standard processing using standard cxc software but was developed independently for hetgs calibration work .",
    "the procedure was to : 1 ) restrict the event list to the nominal grade set ( 0,2,3,4 , and 6 ) , 2 ) remove the event streaks in the s4 chip ( which are not related to the readout streak ) , 3 ) estimate exposure including accounting for frame shift time , 4 ) determine the location of zeroth order using gaussian fits to one dimensional profiles , 5 ) rotate events from sky coordinates to compensate for the telescope roll , 6 ) compute the dispersed grating coordinates ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) using the grating dispersion angles and the dispersion relation , 7 ) correct event energies for detector node - to - node gain variations , 8) select @xmath33 order events using @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the event energy inferred from the acis pulse height , and @xmath36 is 0.20 for the meg and 0.15 for the heg events , 9 ) eliminate events in bad columns where the counts in an histogram deviated by 5@xmath37 from a 50 pixel running median , 10 ) select `` source '' events spatially within a rectangular region 3.6  of the center of the dispersion line and background events in the bands 7.2 to 21.6  from the dispersion line , 11 ) bin meg ( heg ) events at 0.01  ( 0.005 ) , 12 ) eliminate data affected by detector gaps , and 13 ) generate and apply an instrument effective area based on the pre - flight calibration data .",

    "the lines are so broad that it becomes difficult to discern them from the continuum .",

    "the predicted blue- and red - shifts were -0.0670 and 0.1384 , using the equation and parameters in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "wavelengths of line blends were obtained using wavelengths from aped weighted by the relative fluxes of each component , which was especially important for the he - like triplets . the s xv and si",

    "the si xiii line is used to estimate the density in the jet in section  [ sec : models ] . in the red jet system , it was too difficult to measure an accurate redshift for the si xiii triplet due to blending with mg xii from the blue jet and to its low flux .",

    "table  [ tab : linefluxes ] shows that the doppler shifts of the lines in the blue jet system are consistent with a single velocity to within the uncertainties , as are those in the red jet system , although there are very few positively identified lines in the red jet .",
    "there are a few deviations that are not likely to be indicative of intrinsic variations .",
    "the lines generally responsible for the largest deviations are mostly weak , such as ca xx , or are weak he - like triplets , such as ar xvii and mg xi . furthermore , all deviations are substantially smaller than the observed line widths , which are of order 0.006 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we determine that the doppler shift of the blue jet was @xmath47 during this observation .",

    "there is marginal evidence that the fe xxv line has a higher redshift than the other three lines .",

    "the lines are not double peaked , which would be expected if the gas were confined to the rim of the conical outflow , as might occur if the heavy elements were entrained from gas surrounding a leptonic jet .",
    "the lines are not skewed , as might be expected if material was accelerated through a narrow `` nozzle '' . from the consistency and narrowness of the line widths",
    ", we have a very accurate measurement of the jet opening angle : 1.23 @xmath1 0.06 .",
    "the optical lines give a somewhat larger value which may indicate that the optical emission results from interactions of the rapidly moving jet with ambient material much further along the jet , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the jet velocity we measure is 0.2699 @xmath2 , which is larger than the velocity inferred from optical emission lines by 2920 @xmath1 440 km s@xmath0 , lending support to the hypothesis that the optical and x - ray line emission regions are physically distinct .",
    "the blueshifted radiative recombination continua of ne x and ne ix indicate that there is a region of cooler photoionized plasma in the jet .",
    "the line widths give a temperature estimate of about @xmath138 k , which would be found in the jet at @xmath139 cm from the compact object , assuming the adiabatic expansion model .",
    "correcting for interstellar absorption , the ratio of the ne ix to ne x fluxes is 2.1 @xmath1 0.6 , giving an ionization parameter of @xmath140 .",
    "for the constant velocity jet , @xmath141 is constant at about 1.7 @xmath142 cm@xmath0 which would require a photoionizing power of @xmath144 erg s@xmath0 , greatly exceeding both the observed x - ray luminosity and the kinetic power in the jet .",
    "even if this luminosity were present but somehow unobserved , it would still be difficult to understand why there are no detectable mg or si rrc .    as pointed out by @xcite , the electron scattering optical depth across the base of the jet",
    "should not be significantly larger than one because otherwise the emission lines would be significantly broadened by comptonization , which would broaden lines by @xmath145 0.26   for the si resonance lines at about 6  .",
    "this level of broadening is not observed in the s or si resonance lines where it would dominate the velocity broadening or produce a broad pedestal . for the innermost component of the jet emission model",
    ", we can estimate the electron scattering optical depth , @xmath146 , or marginally optically thin . since @xmath147 , @xmath148 so the rest of the jet must be optically thin to electron scattering as well .",
    "the optical depth in the resonance lines is be significantly larger , however , and might explain the drop in emission measure at the highest temperatures seen in figure . in the region that emits the si xiii resonance line , for example , we find that the resonant optical depth at line center is @xmath149 , while @xmath150 .",
    "this means that resonance scattering would increase the effective path length of a line photon , thereby increasing the probability that it is compton scattered out of the line core .",
    "the effective optical depth to line escape is approximately @xmath151 , ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . for si xiii , @xmath152 , so compton scattering may be marginally important ( although a proper radiative transfer calculation using the jet geometry and velocity structure is warranted ) . in the hottest region of table  [ tab : emfit ] @xmath153 for the strongest resonance lines of fe xxv and fe xxvi , both of which have @xmath149 .",
    "using instead the density for this temperature expected by the adiabatic relation ( fig .  [ fig : emeasure ] ) would give @xmath154 for these lines .",
    "therefore , one explanation for why the emission measure appears to deviate from the expected adiabatic relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : emeasure ] ) is that the emission lines from the highest density regions are compton scattered from the core due to resonance trapping , and simply contribute to the continuum .    a reduced emission measure at high temperature",
    "might also be expected if the cone of the jet is truncated at @xmath155 cm , so that the emission measure is integrated over a smaller volume than assumed . in this truncation model",
    ", @xmath80 increases by @xmath14 2 for the highest temperature component in table  [ tab : emfit ] to about @xmath156 @xmath6 .",
    "a revised emission measure model is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : emeasure ] and agrees with the data .",
    "the radius of the base of the visible jet is @xmath157 cm .",
    "we note the interesting agreement between the expansion velocity of the jet perpendicular to the jet axis , v@xmath158 = 866 @xmath1 41 km s@xmath0 , and the sound speed in the rest frame of the flowing gas ,      which is 1149 km s@xmath0 for our estimate of the jet base temperature , @xmath160 k. we speculate that this agreement is physical : the jet expands at the sound speed of hydrogen and that the heavier elements are coupled to the protons at the base of the jet .",
    "the coupling process is unknown but could be related to the jet acceleration process as both must affect protons and ions of high z elements equally .",
    "we thank the referee for many insightful comments on the submitted manuscript , especially for pointing out the importance of resonant line opacity .",
