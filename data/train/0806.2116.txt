    "the coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration , i.e. , the fact that the density values of dark matter , @xmath0 , and dark energy , @xmath1 , are of the same order precisely today , constitutes a serious challenge to our understanding of the evolution of the universe .",
    "the otherwise rather successful vacuum - cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model offers no explanation . in that model ,",
    "the cosmological constant must be fine - tuned many orders of magnitude for the ratio @xmath3 to be of order unity nowadays .",
    "this partly explains why many authors turned to models in which the dark energy density is no longer a constant but evolves with expansion -see",
    "e.g. @xcite for references .",
    "one way to alleviate the coincidence problem is to provide a mechanism by virtue of which @xmath4 tends to a constant at late times @xcite or at least makes it vary slower than the scale factor at present time @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing an interaction between dark matter and dark energy regardless if the latter obeys the dominant energy condition or not @xcite .",
    "most cosmological models assume , for the sake of simplicity , that matter and dark energy interact only gravitationally . in the absence of an underlying symmetry that would suppress a matter - dark energy coupling ( interaction )",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to dismiss it .",
    "further , the coupling is not only likely but inevitable @xcite and its introduction is not more arbitrary than assuming it to vanish . moreover , it has been forcefully argued that the interaction reveals itself when one applies the layzer - irvine equation @xcite to galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "likewise , the cross - correlation of galaxy catalogs with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps seems to observationally favor the interaction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it still remains hypothetical and more abundant , varied , and accurate measurements are needed before its existence ( or non - existence ) can be established observationally .",
    "cosmological models where dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first introduced to justify the small value of the cosmological constant @xcite and currently there is a growing body of literature on the subject -see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "further , in some holographic models of dark energy the accelerated expansion can be traced to the interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , various proposals at the fundamental level , including field lagrangians , have been advanced to account for the coupling @xcite .",
    "obviously , a mechanism that makes @xmath4 tend to a constant today or decrease its rate to a lower value than the scale factor expansion rate ameliorates the coincidence problem significantly , but it does not solve it in full . to do so the said mechanism must also achieve @xmath5 .",
    "we are not aware of any mechanism able to fulfill the latter .",
    "it is the view of the present authors that , on the one hand , @xmath6 ought to be understood -at least , for the time being- as an input parameter much in the same way as other key observational quantities -say , the present value of the cosmic background radiation temperature , the cosmological constant @xmath7 , the age of the universe @xmath8 , or the ratio between the number of baryons and photons . and , on the other hand , its value must be closely related to @xmath7 or , for that matter , to @xmath8 . accordingly , if one successfully express @xmath4 in terms of hubble rate , @xmath9 , the problem of explaining the @xmath6 value reduces to the problem of explaining the present value of @xmath9 .",
    "this is interesting because while we are still lacking model - independent data of @xmath4 at different redshifts , two sets of observational data values -albeit scarce- of @xmath9 at various redshifts are now available .",
    "the first data set was obtained by computing differential ages of passively evolving galaxies in the redshift range @xmath10 @xcite . the other data set",
    "is based on measurements of 192 supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) and 30 radio galaxies up to redshift @xmath11 @xcite .    before proceeding ,",
    "we wish to emphasize that , to the best of our knowledge , no model - independent data of the evolution of the energy densities of matter and dark energy do exist . to obtain such evolution ( e.g. , with respect to redshift ) one must specify some cosmological model . it is to say , the field equations together with the equation of state of dark energy and some assumption about whether the components interact or not .",
    "if they are assumed to interact , one must also provide an expression for the interaction .",
    "let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe dominated by a two - component system , namely , pressureless dark matter and dark energy , such that the components do not conserve separately but interact with each other in a manner to be specified below . the energy density and pressure of the dark energy , assuming it is a quintessence field , are given by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively . if the dark energy is a phantom field we have instead , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the upper - dot stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath16 denotes both the quintessence field potential and phantom potential .",
    "as is usually done , we postulate that the dark energy component ( either quintessence or phantom ) obeys a barotropic equation of state , i.e. , @xmath17 with @xmath18 a negative constant of order unity and lower than @xmath19 ( a distinguishing feature of dark energy fields is a high negative pressure ) .",
    "we assume that the dark matter and dark energy components are coupled through a source ( loss ) term ( say , @xmath20 ) whence the energy balances take the form + @xmath21 + in what follows we shall consider @xmath22 . on the one hand",
    ", this choice ensures that @xmath4 decreases monotonously with cosmic expansion ( as expected in usual models of cosmic structure formation ) and that around present time it varies very slowly , i.e. , slower than the scale factor . on the other hand , it shows compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we note , parenthetically , that if @xmath20 were negative ( i.e. , if dark matter decayed into dark energy ) , it would exacerbate the coincidence problem since the ratio @xmath4 would decrease faster than in the @xmath2cdm model -see eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) below .    in virtue of the above expressions and friedmann s equation , +",

    "\\label{f}\\ ] ] + clearly , eq.([rrh ] ) can be integrated whenever an expression for @xmath20 in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath4 is given .",
    "notice that to have @xmath29 ( a very reasonable assumption since one expects that @xmath30 ) the relationship + @xmath31 + must be fulfilled .",
    "we note in passing that for the @xmath2cdm model ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) one follows @xmath34^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "in the following , we focus on two phenomenological expressions for @xmath20 previously considered in the literature .",
    "as we have carefully checked , both models fit very well the observational data of daly _ et al . _",
    "obtained from selected sets of sn ia and @xmath35 radio galaxies @xcite . in particular , the maximum variation of @xmath36 does not exceed @xmath37 in the redshift interval @xmath38 , thus showing compatibility with the data analysis of daly _ et al .",

    "when the dark energy is of phantom type ( not shown in the figure ) , the evolution of @xmath4 is also similar .",

    "this is why we do not show it here .",
    "the next step is to compute the dependence of the hubble expansion rate on redshift .",

    "the current value of the ratio @xmath87 is of order unity ( more precisely , about @xmath88 -see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this represents the  coincidence problem \" that the @xmath2cdm model seems unable to account for .",
    "nowadays , @xmath6 can not be derived from first principles and like some other key cosmic quantities it has to be considered an input parameter .",
    "it seems obvious , nevertheless , that in einstein relativity it must be closely tied to the present value of the hubble expansion rate , @xmath7 , another quantity whose value we can not explain but that contrary to @xmath6 it does not mean any puzzle .",
    "therefore , a possible avenue to someday solve the coincidence problem may well be to express @xmath4 as a function of @xmath9 ( or vice versa ) in models such that @xmath4 at late times either tends to constant or varies slowly enough ( i.e. , slower than in the @xmath2cdm model ) .",
    "thus , the problem of explaining @xmath6 reduces to the less acute problem of explaining @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we have taken a first step in that direction .",
    "specifically , we have considered two phenomenological models , previously studied in the literature , in which dark energy and dark matter do not evolve separately but interact with each other in such a way that either @xmath4 stays constant at late times ( case @xmath84 ) or varies very slowly ( case @xmath74 ) and , in both instances , we have related @xmath9 to @xmath4 . since model - independent data relating these two quantities are not currently available we have expressed @xmath4 in terms of @xmath59 [ eqs .",
    "( [ rz1 ] ) and ( [ rfz ] ) , respectively ] and resorted to the observational data of refs . @xcite and @xcite that link @xmath9 to @xmath59 .",
    "regrettably , given the scarcity and dispersion of the data ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : hz1 ] and [ fig : hz2 ] ) they are unable to discriminate between models .    nevertheless , it is fair to say that in order not to spoil the well established primeval nucleosynthesis scenario , @xmath89 should not exceed @xmath90 at that early epoch -see bean , hansen , and melchiorri @xcite . at any rate , as figs . [",
    "fig : rvsz1 ] and [ fig : rvsz2 ] show , the models considered in this work are consistent with this constraint which , in any case , was determined using specific non - interacting dark energy models .",
    "it is to be hoped that in the not far future abundant and accurate observational data , in an extended redshift range , may help determine @xmath9 in terms of @xmath59 and solve ( or , at least , help to better understand ) the coincidence problem of late acceleration .",
    "yet , it may well be that the @xmath2cdm model comes to fit the data better than any interacting model .",
    "in such a case , we should conclude that the coincidence problem is just that : a coincidence and , therefore , no longer a problem .",
