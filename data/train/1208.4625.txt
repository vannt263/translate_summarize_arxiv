    "a variety of radial metallicity gradients in disk galaxies are seen , but they are generally on the order of @xmath1  dex  kpc@xmath2 , with the negative sign indicating decreasing metallicity at larger galactocentric radii .",
    "however , surprisingly , these gradients seem to disappear in the outer parts of galactic disks , where there is little star formation ; moreover , the metal content is greater than would be expected given the amount of star formation that has taken place at these radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "high - redshift galaxies , in comparison , are far less regular .",
    "their metallicity gradients range from negative ones significantly steeper than those found locally , to completely flat or even positive .",

    "several processes play an important role in regulating the spatial variation of metals in disk galaxies , and these have been demonstrated by either chemical evolution models or hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the enrichment of metals in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is dominated by star formation and subsequent stellar mass loss , and thus depends on the star formation law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "radial inflow of the gas within the disk of a galaxy redistributes metals @xcite ; galaxy interactions are especially effective in inducing large - scale inflow and flattening metallicity gradients ( @xcite ; torrey et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "turbulence associated with the viscous evolution of gas disks can also redistribute metals @xcite . beyond these gas - dynamical processes ,",
    "radial migration of stars can alter stellar metallicity distributions independently of processes affecting the gas phase @xcite .",
    "however , the strength and relative importance of these processes remains very poorly understood .",
    "semi - analytic chemical evolution models generally parameterize each process and then tune the parameters in an attempt to provide an acceptable match to observations .",
    "however , the large numbers of parameters involved means that even a good fit to the data may not be unique , and the need for fine - tuning means these models have limited predictive power .",
    "moreover , the parameterizations used in the models may not be accurate .",
    "for example , turbulent mixing is usually treated by adopting an @xmath0 prescription for the turbulent transport of angular momentum @xcite , and assuming that the transport coefficient for metals is the same . under these assumptions",
    "turbulent mixing is unimportant unless @xmath0 is so large that the viscous diffusion time becomes comparable to the gas depletion time .",
    "however , neither the assumption that turbulent transport of metals can be approximated with an @xmath0 prescription , nor that @xmath0 for this process is the same as that for the angular momentum , are physically well - motivated . numerical simulations of metal transport that evolve galaxies over cosmological times are unfortunately little better , because their limited resolution means that they must also adopt parameterized treatments of unresolved processes .",
    "for example , most smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations allow no chemical mixing at all between sph particles @xcite , or at best treat mixing approximately using a parameterized subgrid recipe @xcite .",
    "eulerian simulations , in contrast , dramatically over - mix when their resolution is low .",
    "the approach we take in this paper is quite different , and complementary to chemical models and large - scale cosmological simulations .",
    "we isolate a single process : turbulent mixing within a galactic disk .",
    "our goal is to provide a first - principles calculation of this process , which can in turn provide a physically - motivated , parameter - free prescription that can be used in chemical evolution models or lower resolution simulations .",
    "in order to achieve this goal , we simulate turbulent mixing in a portion of a galaxy at very high resolution , including physical processes that are too small - scale to be resolved in cosmological simulations , and we perform a resolution study to ensure that our results are converged . the previous work that most closely matches ours in philosophy and overall",
    "approach is that of @xcite and @xcite , who used high resolution simulations of isolated portions of galaxies to study mixing of supernova ejecta with the ism as galactic winds are launched .",
    "here we perform a similar calculation for turbulent mixing within disks .",
    "there exist many sources that can drive turbulence in the ism ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) . in earlier work ,",
    "@xcite studied the properties of turbulent mixing driven by supernova explosions . here , we instead focus on turbulence driven by thermal instability @xcite .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , the flat metallicity gradients seen in outer disks presumably call for some sort of mixing process to operate at large galactic radii , where star formation is limited and thus supernova explosions are extremely rare .",
    "second , even in places where supernovae do occur , thermal instability is also present and will drive turbulence ; indeed , thermal instability is essentially inevitable anywhere the ism is dominated by atomic hydrogen , which is the case for most galaxies over the great majority of cosmic time .",
    "supernovae will only enhance the turbulence compared to what we find , and thus our results should be viewed as a minimum estimate of the turbulent mixing rate .    in the sections that follow ,",
    "we describe our numerical method and present the results of the simulations .",
    "we then quantify the results in a form appropriate for use in chemical evolution models and discuss their implications .",
    "finally , we summarize the results and conclude .",
    "to study turbulent mixing , we adopt a thin - disk , local - shearing - sheet model similar to @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and equip it with approximate heating and cooling processes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and metal tracers .",
    "we also investigate the effects of spiral shocks and magnetic fields on turbulent mixing in our models . in the following sections , we describe our simulation methodology and setup in detail .        using the local - shearing - sheet approximation @xcite",
    ", we consider a small region distant from the center of a vertically thin disk galaxy .",
    "this region is centered at the potential well of a background stellar spiral arm and co - rotating with the arm at its angular pattern speed @xmath3 .",
    "one can define a coordinate system for this region by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the polar coordinates rotating with the spiral arm and @xmath7 is the location of the point of interest along the stellar spiral arm .",
    "the velocity field of the gas flow in the rotating frame is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "since the differential rotation profile of a disk galaxy @xmath9 is usually a known or given function , we are more interested in the relative velocity of the gas @xmath10 with respect to the circular velocity @xmath11 in the rotating frame . by assuming @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and expanding the magnetohydrodynamical equations to first order in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the continuity , the momentum , the energy , and the induction equations become @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the primitive variables for which we solve the above equations are the gas surface density @xmath22 , the gas relative velocity @xmath23 as defined above , the thermal energy density of the gas @xmath24 ( i.e. , internal energy per unit surface area ) , and the magnetic vector potential @xmath25 . the magnetic field @xmath26 is then calculated by @xmath27 .",
    "the remaining quantities in the above equations are the dimensionless shear parameters @xmath28 the gas pressure @xmath29 , the gravitational potentials due to the stellar spiral arm and the gas itself , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , the electric current density @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the permeability , and the net heating rate per unit surface area @xmath34 .",

    "one particular choice is to rotate the @xmath38 system counterclockwise by the pitch angle @xmath39 into the @xmath40 system such that the new @xmath41-axis and @xmath42-axis are perpendicular and parallel to the stellar spiral arm at the origin , respectively ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "we employ the tightly - wound approximation so that @xmath43 can be deemed a small quantity . in these considerations , equations  ( [ e : continuity ] ) and  ( [ e : energy ] ) remain unchanged while equations  ( [ e : momentum ] ) and  ( [ e : induction ] ) become , by also retaining @xmath44 to only first order , @xmath45    + { \\mathbf{u}}\\times\\left({\\mathbf{b}}_0 + { \\mathbf{b}}\\right ) ,    \\label{e : induction_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the circular velocity and the external magnetic field in this tilted frame can be approximated by @xmath46 respectively , where @xmath47 .",
    "the advantage of aligning our coordinate system with the background stellar spiral arm is that the gravitational potential of the arm in this system can be approximated as periodic in @xmath41 while weakly varying in @xmath42 , to first order @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant , @xmath50 is the radial spacing between adjacent spiral arms , and @xmath51 is the multiplicity of the arms .",
    "the strength of the spiral forcing is measured in terms of the local centrifugal acceleration : @xmath52 note that according to equation  ( [ e : spacing ] ) , the local - shearing - sheet approximation @xmath53 requires that @xmath54 , which is automatically satisfied by the tightly - wound approximation @xmath55 .",
    "in this work , we are only interested in large - scale mixing of metals and ignore self - gravity of the gas .",
    "it will be required , though , in a subsequent paper where we investigate the metal abundances in precursors of molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , we list the equation governing self - gravity of the gas in this section for completeness .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 in equations  ( [ e : momentum ] ) and  ( [ e : momentum_1 ] ) represents the gravitational potential of the gas .",
    "the potential is calculated by solving the poisson equation for a razor - thin disk @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gravitational constant and @xmath58 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we discuss the corresponding numerical method for its solution in section  [ ss : pc ] .      to understand the effects of thermal instability on the mixing of metals , we compare thermally stable disks with thermally unstable ones .",
    "for the former , we use the isothermal equation of state @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the isothermal speed of sound , and in this case , the energy equation  ( [ e : energy ] ) is not required and we do not solve it . for the latter , we adopt the adiabatic equation of state @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the two - dimensional adiabatic index , and include the heating and cooling of the gas such that the disk is thermally unstable .    for a prescription of the heating and cooling rates , we start from the approximate functions suggested by @xcite .",
    "the net rate of heat loss per unit volume is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number density of gas particles and @xmath65 in which @xmath66 is the temperature in kelvins . to obtain the heating rate per unit surface area @xmath34 , we need to integrate @xmath67 in the vertical direction , and the vertical structure of the gas is required . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the gas is vertically isothermal and the number density is approximated by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number density in the mid - plane and @xmath70 is the vertical scale height .",
    "we further assume that the vertical motion of the gas is dominated by non - thermal processes , at least when the gas temperature is low , such that @xmath70 is constant , instead of depending on @xmath66",
    ". therefore , @xmath71,\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath72 , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the mean molecular weight and the atomic mass , respectively . to complete the system",
    ", we use the ideal - gas law @xmath75 for the temperature @xmath66 , where @xmath76 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "finally , we assume the heavy metals in the disk follow the velocity field of the gas component and model them as tracer fluids .",
    "therefore , the surface density of any given metal @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 the concentration of the metal @xmath79 with respect to the total local mass can then be derived by @xmath80 .",
    "the computational domain we consider is a square sheet of size @xmath81 , the radial spacing between adjacent spiral arms defined in section  [ ss : forcing ] . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the initial and boundary conditions we adopt for the gas and the metals .",
    "we initially set the gas to be uniform ( @xmath82 ) , isothermal ( @xmath83 ) , and moving along with the galactic circular motion ( @xmath84 ) such that it is at an equilibrium state when the spiral forcing is not present ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "our adopted initial density @xmath86 can be more physically motivated by considering the corresponding toomre @xmath87 parameter for the gas @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the epicycle frequency of the disk at @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the initial speed of sound .",
    "the epicycle frequency @xmath89 as well as the shear parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 defined in equations  ( [ e : q_0 ] ) and  ( [ e : q_1 ] ) are determined by the rotation profile @xmath94 . as in @xcite , we assume a flat rotation curve ( @xmath95 ) near @xmath90 and a pattern speed of @xmath96 and thus @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . in physical units , the initial surface density is then @xmath100 on top of the equilibrium state , we perturb the velocity field by a white noise of magnitude @xmath101 to seed the instabilities , if any , of the system .    when we consider the isothermal equation of state , our initial isothermality of the gas is automatically guaranteed and preserved .",
    "in this case , only the constant speed of sound @xmath102 needs to specified . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider a non - isothermal disk with heating and cooling processes , an initial thermal equilibrium of the gas is also required .",
    "this is equivalent to setting @xmath103 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , i.e. , zero net heating rate at the initial state . given a surface density @xmath22 , equation  ( [ e : heating ] ) can be used to solve for the corresponding temperature @xmath66 such that @xmath103 . with the values of the physical parameters considered in this work ( see section  [ sss : param ] and table  [ t : param ] ) , figure  [ f : theq ] plots the curve for the states at thermal equilibrium in a pressure - density diagram ; notice the region in @xmath104@xmath105  @xmath106 where the slope of the curve is inverted , the classical condition for thermal instability to occur @xcite .",
    "therefore , a given value of initial toomre stability parameter for the gas @xmath107 uniquely specifies the initial state of the gas @xmath108 .    for magnetized disks , we impose initial uniform azimuthal fields through the gas by setting @xmath109 and @xmath110 throughout .",
    "the strength of these imposed fields can be gauged by the corresponding plasma beta parameter , @xmath111 , which is the ratio of the initial thermal pressure @xmath112 to the initial magnetic pressure .    since our system",
    "is driven by a forcing periodic in the @xmath41 direction with a wavelength of the inter - arm spacing @xmath81 ( equation  ( [ e : phis ] ) ) , it is expected that the response of the system also be periodic in @xmath41 with the same wavelength .",
    "the system is also sheared in the @xmath42 direction , though , which is manifested by the term @xmath113 in equation  ( [ e : cirvel ] ) .",
    "so strictly speaking , the boundary conditions in the @xmath41 direction for the system should be sheared periodic , which can be expressed mathematically in the form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is any dynamical field in question @xcite , except the metal tracer fields ( see below ) . as for the @xmath42 direction ,",
    "we adopt normal periodic boundary conditions @xmath116 for convenience .      given that we model the metals as passive scalar fields",
    ", they effectively act like dye in a flow .",
    "we can in fact inject metals anywhere , anytime , and at any rate , to study their diffusion process .",
    "since most star formation occurs along spiral arms , constantly producing metals that drift downstream towards the next spiral arm , we are most interested in the mixing of metals within one passage between adjacent arms .",
    "this motivates us to employ inflow boundary conditions at the left ( @xmath117 ) and outflow boundary conditions at the right ( @xmath118 ) for the metal tracer field @xmath77 .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath42 direction remains periodic .",
    "the spatial distribution of the newly produced metals from the previous generation of star formation may be arbitrary . to be as general as possible",
    ", we constantly inject a sinusoidal distribution of unit amplitude from the left : @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the wavelength of the distribution .",
    "once the wavelength dependence of the mixing process is deciphered , an arbitrary distribution of metals can be analyzed by fourier decomposition . in all of our models , we simultaneously evolve four species of metal tracers with @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , for which we denote @xmath123 by 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .    at the equilibrium state when there exists no driving force in the system ,",
    "the gas flows azimuthally at circular velocity , and so do the metals . given that the azimuthal direction in our computational domain is tilted from the @xmath42-axis by the pitch angle @xmath39",
    ", we set the initial condition for the metal tracers as @xmath124.\\ ] ]      the values of the physical parameters we adopt and keep constant across different models are listed in table  [ t : param ] . most of these values match those used by @xcite for comparison purposes .",
    "the additional two parameters , mean molecular weight @xmath73 and vertical scale height @xmath70 , come into the system only via the thermodynamics .",
    "for simplicity , we set @xmath125 throughout .. but this difference does not significantly change our results . ]",
    "the vertical scale height is estimated by noting that @xmath126 in a vertically isothermal gas with effective vertical speed of sound @xmath127 and vertical frequency @xmath128 ; in the solar neighborhood , @xmath129 @xcite . by assuming @xmath130  km  s@xmath2 , we calculate @xmath131  pc .",
    "we conduct separate simulations with each combination of three physical effects  spiral forcing , thermal instability , and magnetic fields  to study their influence on the gas dynamics and more importantly the mixing of metals .",
    "the eight resulting models and their numerical resolutions are listed in table  [ t : model ] .",
    "we show in appendix [ s : res ] that this resolution is sufficient to achieve numerically - converged results .",
    "if a model includes spiral forcing , we gradually increase its strength for a duration of 10@xmath132 to @xmath133% , after which the strength remains constant .",
    "when considering the isothermal equation of state , we use a speed of sound of @xmath134  km  s@xmath2 and thus an initial gas surface density of @xmath135  pc@xmath136 .",
    "when considering thermally unstable gas , we adopt a two - dimensional adiabatic index of @xmath137 , which is taken to be the limiting value of a strongly self - gravitating disk of monatomic gas @xcite .",
    "the initial thermal equilibrium in this case requires that @xmath138  pc@xmath136 and @xmath139  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "for magnetized disks , we set the initial plasma beta to be @xmath140 .",
    "we use the pencil code to solve our system of equations discussed above .",
    "it is a cache - efficient , parallelized code optimal for simulating compressible turbulent flows .",
    "it solves the mhd equations , among others , by sixth - order finite differences in space and third - order runge - kutta steps in time , attaining high fidelity at high spectral frequencies @xcite .",
    "although the scheme is not written in conservative form , conserved quantities are monitored to assess the quality of the solution .",
    "several diffusive operations are employed in order to stabilize the scheme .",
    "we use hyper - diffusion in all the four dynamical equations  ( [ e : continuity ] ) , ( [ e : energy ] ) , ( [ e : momentum_1 ] ) , and  ( [ e : induction_1 ] ) to damp noise near the nyquist frequency while preserving power on most of the larger scales @xcite .",
    "shocks are controlled with artificial diffusion of von neumann type @xcite .",
    "for both types of operations , we fix the mesh reynolds number to maintain roughly the same strength of diffusion at the grid scale ( see appendix  [ s : fixre ] ) . finally , all the advection terms of the form @xmath141 , where @xmath142 ( see equation  ( [ e : cirvel ] ) ) and @xmath143 is any state variable , are treated by fifth - order upwinding to avoid spurious oscillations near stagnation points @xcite .",
    "since a local shearing sheet is considered , we need to handle the sheared advection , the boundary conditions , and the poisson equation with care .",
    "the sheared advection terms of the form @xmath144 are directly integrated by fourier interpolations @xcite in order to relieve the time step constraint from shearing velocity @xcite and eliminate the artificial radial dependence of numerical diffusion @xcite .",
    "the sheared periodic boundary conditions discussed in section  [ ss : ibc ] are similarly implemented with fourier interpolations .",
    "the poisson equation  ( [ e : poisson ] ) is solved by fast fourier transforms in sheared fourier space in which the fields are strictly periodic @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the approximate net heating function ( equation  ( [ e : heating ] ) ) in the pencil code .",
    "since the thermal and the dynamical timescales can be quite different , we operator split this term in the energy equation  ( [ e : energy ] ) .",
    "because this heating and cooling process only depends on local properties , the resulting differential equation is ordinary and can be integrated independently at each cell . for these integrations , we adopt the fifth - order embedded runge - kutta method with adaptive time steps @xcite .",
    "since most computational cells are near thermal equilibrium , they require only one or two iterations to match the hydrodynamical time step .",
    "integration of the remaining few cells that have shorter thermal times has negligible computational cost .    with our highest resolution of @xmath1451.5  pc per cell , we are still not able to resolve the thermally stable cold phase of the gas ( see figure  [ f : theq ] ) .",
    "therefore , the densest cells tend to overcool and lose pressure support to their surroundings . to ensure the jeans length is properly resolved and avoid artificial fragmentation @xcite later when we include self - gravity of the gas , we impose a floor to thermal energy density @xmath24 in accord with the local surface density @xmath22 such that the condition of at least four cells per jeans length is satisfied : @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the cell size .",
    "this is in effect a modification to the cooling function at low temperatures . given that our cell size is marginally close to resolving the stable cold phase and our main purpose is to demonstrate if thermal instability can drive effective chemical mixing , we omit any further consideration of sub - scale physics and leave this compromise as a caveat .",
    "all of our models attain statistically steady state within a few local orbital periods . in this section , we report the state of our simulations at this stage .      figures  [ f : rho_nomag ] and  [ f : rho_mag ] show the snapshots of the density field for the non - magnetic and magnetic models , respectively . for models  control and  m , since there exists no driving force in the system ( i.e. , neither spiral forcing nor thermal instability ) , no interesting feature occurs and these models serve as control simulations ; the initial perturbation propagates as sonic waves and remains small in amplitude . for model",
    "f , isothermal disk with spiral forcing , a spiral shock with little azimuthal variation forms and locates slightly upstream of the potential well of the forcing . as can be more clearly seen in the @xmath42-averages of the gas properties plotted in figure  [ f : yaver ] , this resembles the classical solution of @xcite .",
    "when the disk is thermally unstable , the gas spontaneously breaks into two phases , a warm phase of diffuse gas with high volume filling factor and a cold phase of dense gas with filamentary structures , as evident in models  t and  tf shown in figure  [ f : rho_nomag ] .",
    "model  t is simply the standard two - phase model regulated by thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the two - phase medium is turbulent but statistically steady , in which the two phases are in approximate pressure equilibrium .",
    "as demonstrated by model  tf , although the spiral forcing tends to concentrate material into the potential well , the spiral shock seen in isothermal disks is suppressed by the turbulent medium ( figure  [ f : yaver ] ) .",
    "the existence of magnetic fields creates an interesting structure in the gas . for model  mf , magnetized isothermal disk with spiral forcing ,",
    "two discontinuities parallel to the spiral arm occur as shown in figures  [ f : rho_mag ] and  [ f : yaver ] .",
    "the gas remains at roughly the initial state in between the discontinuities , where the magnetic field lines are compressed and magnetic pressure is increased . while the left discontinuity is quite stable , the right discontinuity becomes wobbly after the spiral forcing reaches its maximum strength .",
    "waves are produced in the process and they propagate throughout the disk .",
    "this behavior , however , does not continue to develop in magnitude and drive the gas into a turbulent state .",
    "finally , the magnetized , two - phase , turbulent medium is rather similar to its non - magnetized counterpart , as can be seen by comparing model  mt shown in figure  [ f : rho_mag ] with model  t shown in figure  [ f : rho_nomag ] . as in the non - magnetized case",
    ", the presence of thermal instability significantly weakens the spiral shock , as demonstrated by model  mtf shown in figures  [ f : rho_mag ] and  [ f : yaver ] .      with a statistically steady state of the gas established for each model listed in table",
    "[ t : model ] , we turn to observe how metals would be transported in each flow .",
    "figures  [ f : cc1_nomag][f : cc2_mag ] show snapshots of the metal tracer fields with an injection wavelength of @xmath148 or @xmath149 for each model at time @xmath150 .",
    "since models  control and  m remain at their initial equilibrium states , as described in section  [ ss : gas ] , we expect the metal tracers do the same . in this case , metals should move in the azimuthal direction ( which is tilted to the right at an angle @xmath39 with respect to the @xmath42-axis ) without any noticeable diffusion , and our simulations have passed this benchmark as demonstrated in the snapshots .",
    "when the spiral forcing is present in our non - magnetized isothermal disk ( model  f ) , the tracer field is deformed in the @xmath41 direction , which is perpendicular to the spiral arm . in accord with the velocity field shown in figure",
    "[ f : yaver ] , the metal distribution is first rarified and its wavelength is increased , as the gas approaches the spiral shock . as the gas passes through the shock ,",
    "the metal tracer amplitude is increased to @xmath1455.5 and the wavelength is reduced .",
    "finally the metal field is rarified again to regain the original distribution towards the right boundary .",
    "a similar process occurs in our magnetized isothermal disk ( model  mf ) , except that in this case there exist two discontinuities and propagating waves generated by the wobbly shock on the right .",
    "the waves , however , do not have enough strength to stir the metals , and the metals again tend to retain their original distribution after crossing the right shock .",
    "therefore , the spiral forcing in our isothermal disks , either non - magnetized or magnetized , does not have a noticeable net effect on metal distribution after one passage of the spiral arm .",
    "a completely different scenario for transporting metals occurs in thermally unstable disks . as evident in model  t ,",
    "the turbulence driven by thermal instability significantly churns up the metals , and within only a few wavelengths in distance , the original sinusoidal distribution can not be discerned anymore . to quantify this process , we compute the power spectra of the metal tracer fields at our final times , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the fourier transform of a given metal tracer field .",
    "we compute the fourier transform and thus the power spectrum only for gas in the downstream region , defined as the region @xmath153 for the runs without spiral arm forcing , and as the region beyond the spiral shock for runs with forcing . for models control and m ,",
    "the power spectrum is simply a @xmath154 function at the injection wavelength , while for model f it is a @xmath154 function at a wavelength smaller than the injection scale ( due to compression of the wavelength in the spiral shock ) .",
    "model mf is not quite a @xmath154 function , but is nearly one .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ f : cc_power ] shows the results for models t , tf , mt , and mtf .",
    "we see that the initial large - scale variation in metal density is redistributed to many different scales by the turbulence , and the resulting distribution becomes in fact white noise .",
    "furthermore , this process does not depend on the injection wavelength , at least in the range @xmath155 simulated in our models .",
    "the mixing of metals driven by thermal instability is equally effective among all of our thermally unstable disks . by comparing figure  [ f : cc1_mag ] with figure  [ f : cc1_nomag ] ( or figure  [ f : cc2_mag ] with figure  [ f : cc2_nomag ] )",
    ", the metal tracer fields do not exhibit noticeable differences between models  mt and  t , indicating that magnetic fields play little role in limiting the redistribution of metals by the turbulence . as shown in the same figures ,",
    "although the mixing of metals is less effective in the pre - shock region when spiral forcing is present , the mixing process is significantly accelerated near the shock front , resulting again in white noise in the aftershock region ( figure  [ f : cc_power ] ) .",
    "therefore , we determine the turbulence induced by thermal instability in our models is the only major mechanism in driving mixing of metals , and this mechanism can effectively redistribute metals into white noise within less than inter - arm distances .",
    "having established that the turbulence driven by thermal instability is the primary mechanism for mixing the metals , irrespective of the existence of spiral forcing and/or magnetic fields , we focus our attention on our model  t and attempt to quantify the mixing process .",
    "it is not clear yet if this turbulent mixing can be described as a diffusion process and , if so , what diffusion coefficient describes it . in principle , these questions could be investigated by , for instance , the recently developed test - field method @xcite .",
    "however , we defer this more comprehensive analysis and present a toy model for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the mixing strength and timescale .",
    "we start by considering an observer who co - moves with the background advection ( equation  ( [ e : cirvel ] ) ) and measures the distribution of the metals in the @xmath42 direction , after the turbulent flow has reached its statistically steady state .",
    "we define @xmath156 as the advection time , where @xmath157 is the @xmath41 coordinate of the left boundary , and at every position @xmath41 and thus advection time @xmath158 we compute the one - dimensional fourier transform @xmath159 of @xmath77 in the @xmath42 direction . from this",
    "we compute the one - dimensional power spectrum @xmath160 we plot the result at several values of @xmath158 for @xmath161 in figure  [ f : py_cc1 ] . at small @xmath158",
    "the metal distribution is very close to the sinusoidal one injected from the left boundary , and thus the power spectrum shows that almost all the power is in a single , long - wavelength mode . as the observer moves to the right , turbulent mixing redistributes the metals into many different scales while attenuating the amplitude of the initial distribution in the process . in time , the distribution becomes white noise and the power at all scales decays roughly synchronously while the gas flows towards the right boundary .    if the process of redistributing metals were truly a diffusion process in the @xmath42 direction of the observer s frame , then the distribution of metal tracers as a function of @xmath158 and @xmath42 would obey @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "if we assume @xmath163 is a constant , the solution to equation  ( [ e : diffus ] ) with an initial sinusoidal distribution of wavenumber @xmath164 is @xmath165 where @xmath166 in which @xmath167 is the amplitude of the injected distribution from the left boundary and @xmath168 is the time constant .",
    "therefore , the power of the metal distribution at the injected wavelength decays exponentially according to @xmath169 .",
    "figure  [ f : diffus ] plots the power of the metal distribution in the @xmath42 direction at the injection wavenumber @xmath170 as a function of the advection time @xmath158 in our model  t. two distinct stages of exponential decay can be seen for each metal tracer field , the first of which is steeper than the second .",
    "the transition time @xmath171 between the two stages marks the time required for the metal distribution to become white noise , i.e. , well mixed due to the turbulence .",
    "the shorter the wavelength of the injected distribution @xmath120 , the faster the metals are mixed . with @xmath171",
    "identified for each tracer field , the decay of the power at each stage can be fitted separately by an exponential function as shown by the straight lines in figure  [ f : diffus ] , and the resulting slopes can be converted into the decay time constant @xmath172 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath163 by the formulae given above .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and  @xmath163 for each @xmath120 in our model  t are listed in table  [ t : mixing ] .",
    "the timescales we have measured in our model  t indicate that turbulent mixing of metals driven by thermal instability is an efficient process , especially for the first stage discussed above .",
    "the time required to eradicate kpc - scale variations in metals , i.e. , @xmath171 in table  [ t : mixing ] , is short compared to the orbital timescale @xmath132 . as we have mentioned in section  [ sss : metals ] , the sinusoidal distribution of metal tracers we inject along the left boundary can be considered as the metal enrichment powered by supernovae along a spiral arm . if the characteristic separation between star forming sites along a spiral arm is on the order of one kpc , the metals they produce will become well mixed after @xmath14530  myr of advection .",
    "the second stage of turbulent mixing we see in our models is probably more relevant to long - term chemical evolution of disk galaxies . at this stage , metals are randomly distributed in the ism and are constantly transported by large - scale convective motions of the gas .",
    "like what occurs at the first stage , the signals of the metal variations at all wavelengths decay exponentially with time , although somewhat more slowly .",
    "the decay time constant @xmath172 is on the order of @xmath145100  myr and is relatively insensitive to wavelength .",
    "therefore , if there exists any metallicity gradient on a kilo - parsec scale , the gradient should be @xmath24-folded in roughly the same timescale , and this timescale is comparable to but still less than the orbital timescale of the galaxy .    in this",
    "regard , turbulent mixing of metals should be an important physical process in chemical evolution of disk galaxies , and should be included in chemical evolution models .",
    "although the toy model for turbulent mixing we presented in the previous section may not quantitatively describe the full dynamics of metal transport in turbulent ism , we should have captured an order - of - magnitude estimate of the mixing strength . the diffusion operation along with the diffusion coefficient we have measured may serve as a simple starting point for a sub - grid recipe in chemical evolution models and cosmological simulations .",
    "we note that the diffusion coefficient of the second stage we find for kpc - scale distributions is on the same order of @xmath173  kpc@xmath174  gyr@xmath2 , even though the gas disk is not self - gravitating and presumably has a low @xcite @xmath0 parameter .",
    "in fact , @xmath175 in our model  t is about @xmath176 , where @xmath177 denotes the spatial average of the quantity enclosed .",
    "this demonstrates that the transport of metals does not strictly follow the viscous evolution of the gas disk .",
    "the convective motion of the gas can actually carry the metals over larger distances than a pure viscous stress allows .",
    "therefore , the assumption of the same @xmath0 prescription for both the gas and the metals in a chemical evolution model is not correct .",
    "in this work , we simulate a local patch of a vertically thin disk galaxy and study the transport of metals with a variety of physical conditions .",
    "specifically , we investigate the ability of thermal instability , spiral shocks , and/or magnetic fields to homogenize metals .",
    "we find that turbulence driven by thermal instability is especially effective in mixing the metals , regardless of the presence or absence of spiral shocks and magnetic fields .",
    "we observe two different modes of turbulent mixing in our thermally unstable disks .",
    "the first mode is for the turbulent gas to stir large - scale variations of metals into a random distribution .",
    "the timescale for this mode is short compared to the local orbital time in the galaxy , and this mode may contribute to obliterate the chemical inhomogeneities introduced by star forming activities along spiral arms .",
    "the second mode is for randomly - distributed metals to be continually homogenized over time by the turbulence .",
    "we find the timescale for this process is relatively insensitive to wavelength and is on the order of half the orbital timescale .",
    "this mode of turbulent mixing , therefore , should be of significance in reducing the metallicity gradient in a disk galaxy .",
    "we find that turbulent mixing of metals driven by thermal instability is more efficient than what a simple @xcite @xmath0 prescription of viscosity for the gas would suggest .",
    "the convective motion of the turbulent gas can in fact transport metals over larger distances , especially for kpc - scale variations .",
    "the dynamics is perhaps more complicated than ordinary diffusive transport with a constant coefficient . in an attempt to capture its qualitative behavior , however ,",
    "we have devised a toy prescription in terms of a wavelength - dependent diffusion coefficient and measured its numerical values for our model galactic disk . in principle , this prescription could be adopted as a sub - grid physical process in semi - analytic chemical evolution models as well as cosmological simulations . doing so should help us further constrain the dynamical history of disk galaxies .",
    "this work was supported by the alfred p.  sloan foundation , the nsf through grant career- 0955300 , and nasa through astrophysics theory and fundamental physics grant nnx09ak31 g , and a chandra space telescope grant .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper were conducted using the supercomputing system pleiades at the university of california , santa cruz .",
    "depending on the system of interest , the pencil code requires artificial terms in all dynamical equations , except those describing the passive scalar fields , to stabilize the scheme . to simulate transonic turbulence with formation of shocks ,",
    "we include hyper - diffusion and shock diffusion terms in our simulations .",
    "the hyper - diffusion terms use sixth - order derivatives to damp numerical noise at high wavenumber but preserve power on larger scales @xcite , while the shock diffusion terms are of von neumann type @xcite .",
    "the usual approach is to set the diffusion coefficients to constant values ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 defined below ) .",
    "however , we have implemented a new strategy to dynamically adjust them so that the mesh reynolds number remains nearly constant .",
    "we briefly describe the underlying concept of this implementation in this section .",
    "the hyper - diffusion terms are of the form @xmath180 where @xmath143 is the primitive variable to be solved for and @xmath178 is the hyper - diffusion coefficient .",
    "the strength of this operation can in fact be evaluated by comparing equation  ( [ e : hypdiff ] ) with the advection term @xmath181 .",
    "consider a specific signal ( or rather , noise ) in @xmath143 at wavenumber @xmath182 .",
    "it is damped faster than being advected away if @xmath183 since @xmath184 and @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the maximum magnitude of velocity @xmath23 in the computational domain , equation  ( [ e : hypcrit ] ) implies @xmath187 .",
    "we define the mesh reynolds number for hyper - diffusion as @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the nyquist wavenumber , and @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 are grid spacing in the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath193 directions , respectively .",
    "the aforementioned criterion for damping signals at nyquist frequency then becomes @xmath194 .",
    "motivated by this criterion , we invert equation  ( [ e : reh ] ) to find the value of a time - dependent , spatially uniform hyper - diffusion coefficient @xmath178 with a fixed mesh reynolds number @xmath195 : @xmath196 in other words , we determine the maximum magnitude of the velocity field @xmath186 at the beginning of each time step , and use this information to assign for this step the value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath178 calculated from equation  ( [ e : nu3 ] ) .",
    "this way , we maintain the artificial diffusion at nyquist frequency with roughly the same strength .",
    "due to the high - order dependence of the hyper - diffusion operator on wavenumber ( @xmath197 ) , the damping of noise is then concentrated at and near the nyquist frequency while quickly diminishing towards longer wavelengths .",
    "similarly , we can control the strength of shock diffusion by fixing the appropriately - defined corresponding mesh reynolds number .",
    "the shock diffusion terms are of the form @xmath198 except the one for the momentum equation , which is written as a bulk viscosity @xmath199 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath200 is of the form @xmath201 , where @xmath179 is a positive constant ; @xmath200 is thus spatially variable and is proportional to the local convergence of the flow .",
    "consider again a signal in @xmath143 with wavenumber @xmath182 and compare the strength of shock diffusion with that of the advection .",
    "one obtains @xmath202 note that this criterion is only meaningful near shock fronts .",
    "we therefore define the mesh reynolds number for shock diffusion as @xmath203 which is the most conservative measurement of the reynolds number at the strongest local convergence of the flow . is undefined if there is no position for which @xmath204 , and no shock diffusion operates in this case . ] with this definition , then , we solve equation  ( [ e : res ] ) for the value of the constant @xmath179 with a fixed reynolds number @xmath205 at the beginning of each time step .    in all of our simulations ,",
    "we use @xmath206 except for model  mtf , in which we use @xmath207 .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that our simulations are numerically converged .",
    "the diagnostic we choose to present is the @xmath42-power @xmath208 defined in equation  ( [ e : py ] ) , which is arguably the most important measurement from our simulations made in this paper .",
    "figure  [ f : res ] plots the power @xmath209 as a function of the advection time @xmath158 for @xmath148 and @xmath210 from model  t at different resolutions .",
    "for the case of @xmath148 , the curves from resolutions 128@xmath211128 to 2048@xmath2112048 are roughly on top of each other , and thus they all exhibit almost the same behavior on the two stages of turbulent mixing discussed in section  [ s : mixing ] . for the case of @xmath210 ,",
    "significant amounts of power are lost in the low resolution simulations due to their inability to resolve the short wavelength of the injected metal distribution .",
    "however , one can see in figure  [ f : res ] that the difference between each pair of adjacent curves decreases with higher resolutions , and the curves for the highest two resolutions , 1024@xmath2111024 and 2048@xmath2112048 , roughly coincide , indicating numerical convergence .",
    "therefore , turbulent mixing of metals in our simulations should not be dominated by numerical dissipation , and the values listed in table  [ t : mixing ] should be robust .",
