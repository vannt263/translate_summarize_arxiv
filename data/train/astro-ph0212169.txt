    "the quest for the parameters of the primordial universe has significantly advanced in the last 10 years .",
    "there is a general agreement that @xmath5 , for example from the internal kinematics of clusters and groups @xcite , from the gas fraction in clusters @xcite and groups @xcite .",
    "supernovae used as standard candles have led to @xmath6 , with a degeneracy with @xmath7 . finally , the scales of the angular fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) lead to a nearly perfectly flat universe @xmath8 .",
    "the combination of constraints from supernovae and the cmb recovers @xmath5 ( with @xmath9 ) .",
    "we present below a measurement of the cosmological parameters , with a fairly new technique based upon using very large scale structures ( @xmath10 in size ) as comoving standard rulers .",
    "very large - scale structures should follow the hubble flow .",
    "the rms peculiar velocity within a ball of radius @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where for @xmath13 or for flat universes , @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is the primordial density fluctuation spectrum , ( @xmath16 ^ 3 $ ] higher than the low one ) .",
    "] and @xmath17 is the fourier transform of the top - hat smoothing kernel .",
    "( [ vrms ] ) leads to a present - day value @xmath18 for @xmath19 . since the peculiar velocity increases with time",
    ", one simply finds that the peculiar motion satisfies @xmath20 , so that peculiar motions account for less than 3% for structures larger than @xmath21 .",
    "thus , vlss follow the hubble expansion to good precision , or , in other words , _ very large scale structures should be comoving standard rulers_.",
    "since the report @xcite of a redshift periodicity of structures on the scale of @xmath22 , the existence of a preferred scale for very large scale structures , has been a matter of debate .",
    ".power spectra from wide surveys [ cols=\">,^,^,^,>,<,<,^ \" , ]      notes : 1 ) marginal peak and dip ; 2 ) not deconvolved for survey geometry ; 3 ) @xmath23 [ surveys ]    as seen in table 1 , whereas many authors find significant peaks and dips in @xmath15 , measured from large surveys , they do not agree on their positions . in what follows , we will assume that there _ is _ a feature ( peak or dip ) in @xmath15 , which should lead to a quasi - periodic signal in the space distribution that is essentially frozen in comoving space .",
    "after previous attempts @xcite on a low spectral resolution survey of quasars @xcite , we have analyzed the 2df quasar sample , called 2qz-10k @xcite , publicly made available in the spring of 2001 . after discarding poorly sampled regions ( where the survey completeness was less than 80% ) , leaving us with 2378 quasars , we computed the spatial two - point correlation function of the quasars in 3 redshift bins ( @xmath24 , [ 1.1 , 1.6 ] , [ 1.6 , 2.1]$ ] ) , looking for features at the same comoving separations .",
    "the correlation functions were estimated as @xcite @xmath25/(\\hbox{rr}/n^2)$ ] , where dd , dr and rr indicate the number of data - data , data - random , and random - random quasar pairs respectively .",
    "we avoided redshift selection effects ( emission lines will be visible in some intervals of redshift ) , by constructing our random catalogs with random angular positions , but redshifts obtained by scrambling the distribution in the dataset .",
    "the correlation functions were smoothed with a @xmath26 gaussian .",
    "we then repeated the exercise for @xmath27 pairs of @xmath28 , since the separation of two quasars depends on their angular separation and their two redshifts in a non - trivial function of @xmath7 and @xmath29 .    only in the region @xmath30",
    "did we obtain strong peaks in the correlation functions .",
    "figure  1 @xcite illustrates the subregion  the vertical ellipse centered on @xmath31 and @xmath3 ( 95% confidence )  where the peaks ( at separation @xmath32 ) in the correlation function are at the same comoving separation in the three redshift bins .",
    "_ this appears to be the strongest joint constraint on @xmath7 and @xmath29 from a single survey . _      as a caveat , we have computed the expected correlation function from the power spectrum of @xcite , which we have padded with a cmbfast calculation with @xmath35 that fits well their @xmath15 , using the relation @xmath36 we find oscillations in the @xmath26 gaussian smoothed correlation function that are 25 times smaller than found by @xcite .",
    "we check this by considering a feature in @xmath15 at wavenumber @xmath37 that has amplitude @xmath38 and width @xmath39 decades in @xmath40 . if @xmath41 , eq .  ( [ xiofr ] ) yields @xmath42 . if @xmath43 has a secondary maximum at @xmath44 , then @xmath45 . for @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite , we need @xmath48 .",
    "so if the spike is , say , one - tenth of a decade wide , we need to locally boost @xmath15 by a factor 15 , whereas the measured peak @xcite is only a factor 2 above the interpolated @xmath15 .",
    "it seems clear that there is an inconsistency between these two analyses , and we are presently redoing our analysis of @xmath49 from 2qz-10k to resolve this question . whether @xmath49 or @xmath15 is the better tool for detecting comoving standard rulers across distinct redshift intervals remains an open question .",
