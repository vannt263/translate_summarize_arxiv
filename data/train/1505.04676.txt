    "evolutionary game theory ( egt ) has been proven to be a suitable mathematical framework to model biological and social evolution whenever the success of an individual depends on the presence or absence of other strategies @xcite .",
    "egt was introduced in 1973 by smith and price @xcite as an application of classical game theory to biological contexts , and has since then been widely and successfully applied to various fields , not only biology itself , but also ecology , population genetics , and computational and social sciences @xcite . in these contexts , the payoff obtained from game interactions is translated into reproductive fitness or social success @xcite .",
    "those strategies that achieve higher fitness or are more successful , on average , are favored by natural selection , thereby increase in their frequency .",
    "equilibrium points of such a dynamical system are the compositions of strategy frequencies where all the strategies have the same average fitness .",
    "biologically , they predict the co - existence of different types in a population and the maintenance of polymorphism .    as in classical game theory with the dominant concept of nash equilibrium @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of equilibrium points in random evolutionary games is of great importance because it allows one to describe various generic properties , such as the overall complexity of interactions and the average behaviours , in a dynamical system .",
    "understanding properties of equilibrium points in a concrete system is important , but what if the system itself is not fixed or undefined ?",
    "analysis of random games is insightful for such scenarios . to this end",
    ", it is ambitious and desirable to answer the following general questions :    * how are the equilibrium points distributed ?",
    "how do they behave when the number of players and strategies change ?",
    "*    mathematical analysis of equilibrium points and their stability in a general ( multi - player multi - strategy ) evolutionary game is challenging because one would need to cope with systems of multivariate polynomial equations of high degrees ( see section [ sec : pre ] for more details ) .",
    "nevertheless , some recent attempts , both through numerical and analytical approaches , have been made .",
    "one approach is to study the probabilities of having a concrete number of equilibria , whether all equilibrium points or only the stable ones are counted , if the payoff entries follow a certain probability distribution @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that these probabilities provide elaborate information on the distribution of the equilibria .",
    "however , it consists of sampling and solving of a system of multivariate polynomial equations ; hence is restricted , even when using numerical simulations , to games of a small number of players and/or small number of strategies : it is known that it is impossible to ( analytically ) solve an algebraic equation of a degree greater than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to analyze the attainability of the patterns and the maximal number of evolutionarily stable strategies ( ess ) @xcite , revealing to some extent the complexity of the interactions .",
    "this line of research has been paid much attention in evolutionary game theory and other biological fields such as population genetics @xcite .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , the authors investigate the expected number of internal equilibria in a multi - player multi - strategy random evolutionary game where the game payoff matrix is generated from normal distributions . by connecting egt and random polynomial theory ,",
    "they describe a computationally implementable formula of the mean number of internal equilibrium points for the general case , lower and upper bounds the multi - player two - strategy random games , and a close - form formula for the two - player multi - strategy games .    in this paper , we address the aforementioned questions , i.e. , of analysing distributions and behaviours of the internal equilibria of a random evolutionary game , in an _ average _ manner .",
    "more specifically , we first analyse the expected density of internal equilibrium points , @xmath6 , i.e. the expected number of such equilibrium points per unit length at point @xmath7 , in a @xmath0-player @xmath1-strategy random evolutionary game where the game payoff matrix is generated from a normal distribution ( for short , normal evolutionary games ) . here",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , denotes the ratio of frequency of strategy @xmath10 to that of strategy @xmath1 , respectively ( more details in section [ sec : pre ] ) .",
    "in such a random game , we then analyse the expected number of internal equilibria , @xmath3 , and , as a result , characterize the expected number of internal _",
    "stable _ equilibria , @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain both quantitative ( asymptotic formula ) and qualitative ( monotone properties ) results of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as functions of the ratios , @xmath7 , the number of players , @xmath0 , and that of strategies , @xmath1 .    to obtain these results ,",
    "we develop further the connection between egt and random polynomial theory explored in @xcite , and more importantly , establish appealing ( previously unexplored ) connections to the well - known classes of polynomials , the bernstein polynomials and legendre polynomials .",
    "in contrast to the direct approach used in @xcite , our approach avoids sampling and solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations , thereby enabling us to study games with large numbers of players and/or strategies .",
    "we now summarise the main results of the present paper .",
    "the main analytical results of the present paper can be summarized into three categories : asymptotic behaviour of the density function and the expected number of ( stable ) equilibria , a connection between the density function with the legendre polynomials , and monotonic behaviour of the density function .",
    "in addition , we provide numerical results and illustration for the general games when both the numbers of players and strategies are large .    to precisely describe our main results ,",
    "we introduce the following notation regarding asymptotic behaviour of two given functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14    note that throughout the paper we sometimes put arguments of a function as subscripts . for instance",
    ", the expected density of internal equilibrium points , @xmath6 , besides @xmath7 , is also analyzed as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",

    "the formal definitions of these three functions are given in section [ sec : pre ]",
    ".   in theorem [ theo : concentration ] , we prove the following asymptotic behaviour of @xmath15 for all @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",

    "* theorem 2 ) , which is , @xmath21 .",
    "these results lead to two important corollaries .",
    "first , we obtain a sharper bound for the expected number of stable equilibria , @xmath22 , and the corresponding limit , @xmath23 , see corollary [ cor : expected stable equi ] . the second corollary , corollary [ cor : expected zeros bernstein ] , is mathematically significant , in which we obtain lower and upper bounds and a limiting behaviour of the expected number of real zeros of a random bernstein polynomial .",

    "we conjecture that this condition holds true and support it by numerical simulation .",
    ".   in theorem [ theo : en2 ] , we provide an upper bound for @xmath28 .",
    "we also make a conjecture for @xmath6 and @xmath3 in the general case ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we offer numerical illustration for our main results in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "the density function @xmath6 provides insightful information on the distribution of the internal equilibria : integrating @xmath6 over any interval produces the expected number of real equilibria on that interval . in particular , the expected number of internal equilibria @xmath3 is obtained by integrating @xmath6 over the positive half of the space .",
    "theorem [ theo : fd / d decreases ] and proposition [ prop : condition for f increase ] , which are deduced from theorems [ theo : fd interm of pd ] and [ theo : fd interms of pd and pd-1 ] , are qualitative statements , which tell us _ how _ the expected number of internal equilibria per unit length @xmath30 in a @xmath0-player two - strategy game changes when the number of players @xmath0 increases . theorem [ theo : concentration ] quantifies its behaviour showing that @xmath30 is approximately ( up to a constant factor ) equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath31 , as seen in theorem [ theo : concentration ] , certainly satisfies the properties that @xmath32 increases but @xmath33 decreases .",
    "thus , it strengthens theorem [ theo : fd / d decreases ] and further supports conjecture [ cojecture : fd increases ] .",
    "theorem [ theo : behavior of e2 ] is also a quantitative statement which provides an asymptotic estimate for the expected number of internal ( stable ) equilibria .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that the expected number of real zeros of a random polynomial has been extensively studied , dating back to 1932 with block and plya s seminal paper @xcite ( see , for instance ,  @xcite for a nice exposition and  @xcite for the most recent progress ) .",
    "therefore , our results , in theorems [ theo : behavior of e2 ] , [ theo : fd interm of pd ] and [ theo : fd interms of pd and pd-1 ] , provide important , novel insights within the theory of random polynomials , but also reveal its intriguing connections and applications to egt .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : pre ] , we recall relevant details on egt and random polynomial theory .",

    "finally , some detailed proofs are presented in the appendix .",

    "they have frequencies @xmath34 , @xmath35 , respectively , satisfying that @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the interaction of the individuals in the population is in randomly selected groups of @xmath0 participants , that is , they play and obtain their fitness from @xmath0-player games .",
    "we consider here symmetrical games ( e.g. the public goods games and their generalizations @xcite ) in which the order of the participants is irrelevant .",
    "let @xmath38 be the payoff of the focal player , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the strategy of the focal player , and @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) be the strategy of the player in position @xmath44 .",
    "these payoffs form a @xmath45-dimensional payoff matrix @xcite , which satisfies ( because of the game symmetry ) @xmath46 whenever @xmath47 is a permutation of @xmath48 .",
    "this means that only the fraction of each strategy in the game matters .",
