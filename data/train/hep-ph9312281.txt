    "<S> * 1 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction *    the future ultra - relativistic heavy ion collider experiments at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) are expected to exhibit new phenomena associated with `` qcd in medium '' , i.e. with the microscopic dynamics of quarks and gluons in the hot , ultra - dense environment that may be created in the central collision region of these reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , considerable progress has been made in a better understanding of the space - time structure of parton interactions during the early stage of these reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion emerging from different independent investigations @xcite , is that - for rhic energies and beyond  most of the entropy and transverse energy is presumably produced already during very early times ( within the first 2 fm after the nuclear contact ) by frequent , mostly inelastic , semihard parton collisions involving typical momentum transfers of only a few gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying notion is that the early stage of nuclear collisions at sufficiently high energies can well be described in terms of the space - time evolution of many internetted parton cascades @xcite , based on renormalization group improved perturbative qcd @xcite and relativistic kinetic theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this physical picture is motivated by the successful `` semihard qcd '' description of high energy hadronic interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the application to ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions , in particular heavy ion reactions @xcite , assumes that the colliding nuclei may be viewed as two coherent clouds of space - like partons with small virtualities that materialize into `` real '' excitations due to primary parton - parton scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> this primary parton production is expected to result in a large initial particle and energy density in the central collision region , which increases further by subsequent intense gluon bremsstrahlung , secondary scatterings and rescatterings .    at some point however , </S>",
    "<S> when the parton density becomes so large that the quanta begin to overlap in phase - space , recombination ( fusion ) processes become relevant and the density must saturate towards its limiting value . </S>",
    "<S> it is realized that these semihard processes play the major role for the nuclear dynamics at collider energies . </S>",
    "<S> the copiously produced minijets @xcite can not be considered as isolated rare events , but are embedded in complicated multiple cascade - type processes , as has been discussed more recently in a number of works @xcite . at the same time it is found @xcite that color correlations among the initial partons randomize so rapidly as the beam particles interpenetrate , such that the long range color field effectively vanishes on a space - time scale of a small fraction of a fm . </S>",
    "<S> thus the short range character of the interactions implies that perturbative qcd can and must be used , and that for example the string picture does not apply anymore .    however , one is still far from a complete and detailed picture , as is reflected by the considerable theoretical uncertainty in perturbative qcd predictions for global observables in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath0 ) collisions at collider energies , such as particle multiplicities and transverse energy production . </S>",
    "<S> the inability to extrapolate accurately from of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) data to heavy ion @xmath0 collisions is due to the current lack of better knowledge about the details of important nuclear and dense medium effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is neither surprising , nor satisfying , that numerical simulations with qcd based monte carlo models such as hijing @xcite , dtujet @xcite or the parton cascade model ( pcm ) @xcite , agree very well in describing @xmath1 collisions at collider energies , but differ in their predictions , for e.g. charged particle multiplicities , in heavy ion @xmath0 collisions by a factor of 2 or more .    </S>",
    "<S> the central question is therefore : how is `` qcd in medium '' modified as compared to `` qcd in vaccuum '' ? in trying to gain a more quantitative knowledge about the microscopic parton dynamics in medium , the most urgent questions concern ( i ) the initial conditions regarding the parton substructure of large nuclei , in particular the small @xmath3 region and the magnitude of nuclear shadowing effects ; ( ii ) the role of color screening and color diffusion ; ( iii ) the impact of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ; ( iv ) the space - time dependence of parton interactions with regard to the influence of the characteristic interaction times of parton scatterings and the formation times for gluons emitted in bremsstrahlung processes .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding `` qcd in medium '' is also one of the most interesting experimental challenges for rhic and lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this can be achieved by analyzing the characteristic space - time structure of parton interactions during the very early stage in @xmath4 and @xmath0 collisions , e.g. by measuring the production of particles emerging from these early times , such as dileptons , direct photons , strange and charmed particles .    </S>",
    "<S> recently it was pointed out by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite that a consistent perturbative calculation of parton structure functions at small values of the bjorken variable @xmath3 becomes possible when one considers the limit of a very thick nuclear target . </S>",
    "<S> a projectile propagating at high energy through such a target `` sees '' a very large area density of valence quarks , and hence experiences an effective screening of color interactions in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the applicability of perturbative qcd then is that the screening distance is much shorter than the confinement scale @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is satisfied for a sufficiently thick target at sufficiently small @xmath3 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we want to make use of this insight to explore the evolution of a parton cascade inside nuclear matter under conditions where perturbative qcd applies because medium induced effects , such as color screening and rescattering , provide dynamical cut - offs on a scale short compared to @xmath5 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , our approach applies to the propagation of fast partons in any kind of dense medium , be it a thermalized quark - gluon plasma or ground state nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the equations derived here can therefore be applied to jet quenching in a qcd plasma @xcite as well as to the fragmentation cascade of a quark after deep - inelastic scattering in an infinitely large nucleus @xcite . to keep the discussion specific </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider the following idealized problem . beginning with a prescribed initial distribution of fast partons injected into </S>",
    "<S> infinitely extended nuclear matter by some highly localized process of space - time extent , @xmath6 , we want to follow the evolution of the parton distribution in laboratory time , as it propagates through the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> our plan is to introduce a simplified version of the parton cascade approach of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which we propose as a supplementary diagnostic tool for a more transparent analysis of the aforementioned aspects of qcd in medium . </S>",
    "<S> we will reduce the complex space - time structure of multiple connected parton cascades to the problem of the diffusion of quarks and gluons in dense nuclear matter , for which we can apply an analytical treatment using methods . </S>",
    "<S> our rationale is to ignore all processes irrelevant in the present context ; therefore we will neglect here the quantitatively important effects of color screening , long range color correlations , parton shadowing , etc . </S>",
    "<S> those aspects may be incorporated in a future extension of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> let us describe in some more detail the essence of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to etablish a connection between the semiclassical probabilistic picture of parton evolution in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) @xcite and the time development of parton cascades in six - dimensional phase space within the framework of non - equilibrium kinetic theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we need to clarify two fundamental issues : first we need to relate the altarelli - parisi - lipatov ( apl ) evolution equations @xcite , which determine the change of the parton number densities under variation of the variables rapidity @xmath7 and transverse momentum @xmath8 , or @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with the boltzmann equation , which controls the time evolution of the phase space densities in both momentum and coordinate space . </S>",
    "<S> second , we must relate the experimentally accessible number densities @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( quarks and antiquarks of flavor @xmath14 , and gluons ) with the single - particle phase space densities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .    the first point - the connection between the apl evolution equations and the boltzmann equation  has been previously suggested , tentatively by durand and putikka @xcite , and explicitly by collins and qiu @xcite , however , in the formal context of hadron structure which is rather different from our considerations of parton cascades in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> although both these authors succeeded in a rederivation of the apl equations on the basis of a complete probabilistic picture , they stopped short in actually establishing the correspondence between qcd evolution and the space - time development of the parton distributions . nevertheless , the alternative approach of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that the apl equations can be derived in a statistical manner similar to the boltzmann equation , by taking into account both the gain _ and _ the loss of partons due to successive @xmath18 branchings in @xmath19-space . </S>",
    "<S> this self - contained detailed balance eliminates the necessity of calculating vertex and wave function renormalization explicitly , because the loss terms naturally take over this role . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting evolution equations are free of divergences and satisfy the constraints imposed by momentum and quark number conservation automatically .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the second point , we note that the measured parton number densities @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , give the probability for finding a quark , antiquark , or gluon , inside a nucleon with fraction @xmath22 of the longitudinal nucleon momentum @xmath23 and with virtuality @xmath24 , or transverse momentum @xmath25 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 sets the scale of hardness that is identified with the momentum transfer of an interaction of the parton with a weakly interacting probe ( e.g. a virtual photon ) that measures the nucleon substructure . at present , the parton number densities are experimentally accessible only in a space - time integrated way and therefore must be interpreted as instantanous distributions of partons inside a nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation , however , has a justified operational meaning only in a reference frame in which the nucleon moves close to the speed of light , because in such a frame time dilation slows the internal motion of the partons such that the statistical picture can be applied @xcite . on the other hand , in statistical many - particle systems </S>",
    "<S> the phase - space distribution @xmath27 is the probability density for finding a parton of species @xmath28 in a phase - space element @xmath29 at time @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently @xmath31 contains explicit additional information about the space - time structure of the initial state nucleons or nuclei , which is only present in an averaged way in the measured parton number densities .    on the basis of this knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , we will here extend the probabilistic approach to the space - time evolution of partons in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we will first relate the @xmath24-evolution to the development with time @xmath30 , and second , we will include not only the @xmath18 branching processes , but also the reverse @xmath32 fusion processes and in addition @xmath33 scattering processes . the latter two types of processes indirectly also give rise to additional stimulated branchings . stimulated emission , fusion and scattering processes are naturally absent in vacuum , but in medium they are indispensible ingredients for obtaining a complete set of of transition amplitudes and a self - consistent parton evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we set up the physical scenario of parton cascade evolution inside nuclear matter and introduce the framework of kinetic decription including a consistent treatment of off - shell propagation of partons . </S>",
    "<S> we will relate the quark and gluon number densities , as measured by the structure functions , with the time - dependent phase space distributions of off - shell partons and will translate the qcd evolution of the parton number densities into the space - time development of parton cascades . on the basis of this connection , </S>",
    "<S> the rates for branching , fusion and scattering processes of the partons interacting with the medium are derived . in sec . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we generalize the considerations and obtain a set of coupled equations for the space - time evolution of quarks , antiquarks and gluons . finally , we summarize our results and give some possible future perspectives .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2 . description of parton showers in nuclear matter *    * 2.1 physical picture of parton showers in medium *    the physical situation that we have in mind is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . we consider a parton cascade initiated by a high energy time - like quark or gluon that has been produced at some point of time @xmath34 inside a heavy nucleus due to an external interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for instance by a collision of a proton with the nucleus , in which case the parton is produced by a scattering with another parton of the incoming proton and is provided with a time - like virtuality @xmath35 where @xmath36 is determined by the momentum transfer in the scattering . or by deep inelastic scattering , where the parton is struck by a space - like virtual photon with invariant mass squared @xmath37 and it acquires a time - like virtuality @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , this _ primary _ parton then propagates through the partonic matter of the nucleus and initiates of a shower of _ secondary _ partons . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive feature of such a scenario is that it provides a good control of the initial conditions : the primary parton is produced with a well defined four - momentum , determined by the momentum transfer of the triggering interaction with the external particle . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with a nucleus - nucleus collision , in which case there are many comoving nucleons and the initial state contains a rather complicated mixture of initially produced partons with a a rather broad momentum distribution .    to set a definite physical situation we will from now on consider a proton - nucleus ( @xmath4 ) collision @xcite . in order to apply the parton picture one has to go into a frame where both the projectile proton and the target nucleus are moving very fast , so that both the proton and the nucleons in the nucleus can be resolved into individual partons @xcite . the description of a nucleon as an instantaneous distribution of partons at any time requires probing the nucleon over time durations and spatial distances small on the scale of internal motions of the partons </S>",
    "<S> this condition is fulfilled in any frame of reference in which the nucleon moves almost with the speed of light , because the time dilation effect slows the internal motions such that the nucleon can be described as a simple quantum mechanical ensemble of quasireal partons that do not mix with vacuum fluctuations ( except for the slowest gluons and sea quarks ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to choose the _ nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass frame _ ( cm@xmath39 ) </S>",
    "<S> in which each nucleon has the same value of longitudinal momentum @xmath23 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , @xmath40 so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the nuclear mass number , @xmath44 the nucleon mass , and @xmath45 is assumed , a requirement which is certainly satisfied at the colliding beam accelerators rhic and lhc . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at rhic , the maximum @xmath23 is 250 gev for @xmath46 , 125 gev for @xmath47 and 100 gev for @xmath48 @xcite . at lhc </S>",
    "<S> one has generally a factor of 30 larger energy available @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the primary quark or gluon originates from the proton structure function , carrying longitudinal momentum @xmath49 , and is provided with an initial time - like virtuality @xmath50 by a hard scattering with one of the nuclear partons . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this primary parton is so to say injected into the nucleus and probes the nuclear environment . </S>",
    "<S> it will subsequently produce a number of secondary partons by various interactions with the nuclear background matter : the incident primary parton can either ( i ) radiate bremsstrahlung gluons , ( ii ) collide with partons of the nuclear background matter , or , ( iii ) absorb these nuclear partons . </S>",
    "<S> the so produced secondary partons will subsequently undergo the same type of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> that is , they themselves will lose energy - momentum by either exciting partons bound in the nucleus off which they scatter on their way , or by radiating gluon bremstrahlung , or ( in case of gluons ) materialize through quark - antiquark pair production . at every new step </S>",
    "<S> the number of particles increases and their average energy and longitudinal momentum decreases , until the growing density enhances reverse absorption ( fusion ) processes that may yield a detailed balance , or until eventually all the energy - momentum of the primary particle can be considered as completely dissipated . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this event as a _ </S>",
    "<S> parton shower _ or _ </S>",
    "<S> parton cascade_. we emphasize that we will explicitly distinguish between the _ shower partons _ on the one hand , and the _ nuclear partons _ on the other hand , which are coherently bound in the wave function of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it should be clear from the above selection of processes ( i)-(iii ) that we consider here only _ interactions between the shower partons and the nuclear partons _ , and not among the shower partons or the nuclear partons themselves . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we consider here the evolution of a single cascade and therefore only account for interactions of the cascade with the medium but neglect interactions between possible simultaneous cascades ( we will briefly consider a self - interacting cascade at the end of section 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we will describe the longitudinal evolution of the parton shower along the _ shower axis _ ( @xmath51-axis ) , which we define parallel to the direction of momentum of the initiating primary parton . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to parametrize the four - momenta @xmath52 of the shower partons such that for the primary parton , @xmath53 whereas for the @xmath54 secondary parton , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is assumed , and all rest masses are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that energy and momentum are independent variables , since we are dealing with off - shell particles of virtuality @xmath24 with a continuous mass spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of a many parton system is described by the change of _ parton number densities _ of quarks @xmath11 and antiquarks @xmath12 of flavor @xmath14 , or gluons @xmath13 , which are defined as , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of partons of type @xmath28 present at time @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the corresponding phase - space density of partons at @xmath29 , and @xmath59 in the second line representing the spatially integrated energy - momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> note that we introduced an explicit time dependence in the parton number densities ( [ axt ] ) , and also treat @xmath24 and @xmath25 as independent variables , in contrast to the usual identification @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we stress that @xmath24 and @xmath30 are actually correlated variables , as we will show . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the parton densities are in fact functions of @xmath24 as well as @xmath30 , and we have to describe their @xmath24-evolution as well as their time development . on the other hand , the experimentally accessible parton densities are related to the functions ( [ axt ] ) by @xmath60    consequently the invariant mass spectrum in @xmath24 measures the degree of excitation of the shower particles , which will be related to their `` age '' in the cascade , whereas the variable @xmath61 measures the change of the longitudinal momenta of the cascade partons , and the transverse momentum distribution in @xmath25 reflects the diffusion perpendicular to this axis . according to our chosen geometry </S>",
    "<S> , the primary parton has no transverse momentum at all , @xmath62 , but it is off - mass shell by an initial virtuality @xmath63 . as the parton shower develops in space - time due to branching , fusion and scattering processes , the distribution in @xmath3 will shift to smaller values , the distribution in @xmath25 will broaden , and the in the average the virtuality @xmath24 of the secondary partons will decrease . </S>",
    "<S> how fast such a cascade evolves will depend on the medium properties , which will be reflected in the `` age '' distribution of shower particles . </S>",
    "<S> the denser the medium the slower will be the aging process . in the following section we will derive a quantitative formulation of this evolution </S>",
    "<S> ; however , as a motivation let us already here draw a qualitative picture . consider for the moment the evolution of a cascade in vacuum , i.e. in the absence of a surrounding medium , so that scattering and fusion processes will not be present . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the cascade evolves solely by successive branchings . in the lla </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of time - like virtualities @xmath24 is subject to the ordering condition @xmath64 where @xmath65 sets an invariant mass scale at which the perturbative description of the branching cascade fails . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly ordered decrease of virtualities is valid in the kinematic region where @xmath66 , as we already assumed after eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pj ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it eliminates complicated quantum - mechanical interference effects in successive branchings . in a certain intermediate branching in the cascade @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> , the four - momentum @xmath68 is given by ( [ pj ] ) and energy - momentum conservation at the vertex uniquely relates the momenta of the daughters @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , conservation of longitudinal momentum implies @xmath71 transverse momentum conservation requires @xmath72 and energy conservation yields @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the squared intrinsic transverse momentum generated with respect to the @xmath76 direction . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we assumed here a symmetric distribution in azimuthal angle . </S>",
    "<S> hence , both the longitudinal and ( on average ) the squared transverse momentum are additive , and the value of @xmath77 with respect to the shower axis is determined by the virtualities and the ratios of longitudinal momenta of mother and daughters . </S>",

    "<S> finally we stress that the evolution equations ( [ eq])-([eg ] ) can immediately be generalized to treat the cascading partons and the partons of the nuclear medium on the same footing , by dropping our bookkeeping distinction among those two particle sources . </S>",
    "<S> this would then describe a dynamically coupled system in which the parton cascade evolution feeds back on the nuclear parton distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the only differences to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq])-([eg ] ) are that the nuclear parton densities also become time - dependent , i.e. @xmath387 , where @xmath388 , and in the gain term of @xmath389 fusion , as well as in the @xmath390 scattering rates an additional factor of @xmath391 would be needed , because the two interacting gluons , a cascade parton and a nuclear parton , can not be distinguished anymore . however , the response of the nuclear density to the penetrating parton shower is naturally delayed and only locally effective , so that the parton cascade to a good approximation can be viewed as being unaffected by this time variation of the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> of course this approximation does not apply anymore when there are multiple cascades evolving simultaneously close to each other in phase - space , as e.g. in a nucleus - nucleus collision . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case the full space - time history of both the cascading partons as well as the nuclear partons needs certainly to be taken into account . * </S>",

    "<S> summary *    to summarize the essence of this work , let us list what we believe are the most important points : we have derived integro - differential equations for the evolution of a parton cascade in an infinite , homogeneous nuclear medium , describing the parton distributions in terms of the bjorken variable @xmath3 and virtuality @xmath24 ( or `` age '' @xmath125 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz invariant evolution equations have the character of transport equations in momentum space , familiar from non - equilibrium kinetic theory , however , they include effects of off - shell propagation in addition to collision terms . in the absence of a medium </S>",
    "<S> the equations reduce to the altarelli - parisi - lipatov equations for the @xmath24-evolution of the parton number densities in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> possible immediate applications of the evolution equations are , for example , to the fragmentation of partons in heavy nuclei , and to hard qcd probes of a quark - gluon plasma </S>",
    "<S> . the equations can be easily generalized to provide a description of parton transport in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions by treating the shower partons and the nuclear partons on the same footing . </S>",
    "<S> since our derivation was partially based on heuristic arguments , it would be desirable to obtain a formal justification from fundamental principles of quantum field theory by green s function methods .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope to address these issues in future publications . </S>"
