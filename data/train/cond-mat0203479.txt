    "one of the main problems in the physics of high  temperature copper oxide superconductors ( htsc ) remains the nature of the so called pseudogap state @xcite , existing in the wide region of the phase diagram .",
    "pseudogap anomalies in electronic properties of these systems are observed in a number of experiments , such as measurements of optical conductivity , nmr , inelastic neutron scattering and angle  resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite . in our opinion @xcite , the preferable scenario for the pseudogap formation in copper oxides is based on the picture of strong scattering of current carriers on well developed fluctuations of `` dielectric '' ( antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or charge density wave ( cdw ) ) short  range order , existing in the appropriate region of the phase diagram .",
    "this scattering is strong in the vicinity of a characteristic scattering vector @xmath0 ( @xmath1  is the lattice spacing of the two  dimensional lattice ) , corresponding to the doubling of lattice period ( vector of antiferromagnetism ) and is a `` precursor '' of the spectrum transformation due to the appearance of the long  range afm  order .",
    "accordingly , in this region of the phase diagram develops essentially non  fermi liquid like renormalization of electronic spectrum in certain parts of the momentum space , close to the `` hot spots '' on the fermi surface @xcite , where this surface is effectively `` destroyed '' .",
    "direct experimental confirmation of this scenario for the pseudogap formation was obtained in recent arpes  experiments on @xmath2 @xcite , where the pseudogap renormalization of electronic spectrum was observed in the vicinity of _ separate _ `` hot spots '' .",
    "within this scenario of the pseudogap formation we can formulate a simplified `` nearly exactly '' solvable model , describing the main anomalies of this state @xcite , which takes into account all feynman diagrams of perturbation theory for scattering by ( gaussian ) fluctuations of short  range order with characteristic scattering vector from the vicinity of @xmath3 , determined by the appropriate correlation length @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the two  dimensional generalization of the pseudogap formation in one  dimension due to fluctuations of cdw  type short  range order proposed rather long ago by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "simplified variant of this two  dimensional model ( `` hot patches '' model ) was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe basic anomalies of superconducting state , formed on the `` background '' of the `` dielectric '' pseudogap .    in refs .",
    "@xcite mainly one  particle properties of the model were analyzed , such as the spectral density and the density of states .",
    "the remarkable property of this model is the possibility to sum also the whole feynman series for the two  particle problem for the vertex part , describing the system response to an external field ( e.g. electromagnetic ) @xcite . in the simplified version of the `` hot patches '' model",
    "such calculations for the two  dimensional case were performed in ref .",
    "the main aim of the present work is the detailed analysis of both the theoretical aspects of calculations of two  particle properties of the more general model @xcite and calculations of the optical conductivity for different geometries ( topologies ) of the fermi surface , appearing for `` realistic '' enough spectrum of non  interacting electrons .",

    "range order is usually described by the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath5 of the following form , determined by fitting to nmr data @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7  is a coupling constant , @xmath4  correlation length of spin fluctuations , @xmath8  vector of antiferromagnetic ordering in dielectric phase , @xmath9  characteristic frequency of spin fluctuations . both dynamic susceptibility and effective interaction ( [ v ] )",

    "[ hspts ] ) and `` cold '' with momenta around the parts of the fermi surface around brillouin zone diagonals @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that quasiparticles from the regions around the `` hot spots '' are strongly scattered with the momentum transfer of the order of @xmath3 by spin fluctuations ( [ v ] ) , while for quasiparticles with momenta far from the `` hot spots '' this interaction is small enough .    for high enough temperatures @xmath11 we can neglect the spin dynamics @xcite , and use the static approximation in ( [ v ] ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13  is an effective parameter with dimension of energy . in the following ,",

    "@xcite , we consider both @xmath13 and @xmath4 as phenomenological parameters , to be determined from experiments . considerable simplification of calculations , allowing to analyze higher order contributions of perturbation theory , can be achieved if we replace ( [ vef ] ) by the model interaction of the following form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",

    "<S> we consider a two  dimensional model of the pseudogap state , based on the scenario of strong electron scattering by fluctuations of `` dielectric '' ( afm , cdw ) short  range order . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a system of recurrence equations both for one  particle green s function and vertex part , describing electron interaction with an external field , which take into account all feynman graphs for electron scattering by short  range order fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the results of detailed calculations of optical conductivity are presented for different geometries ( topologies ) of the fermi surface , demonstrating both the effects of pseudogap formation and localization effects . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data obtained for high  temperature superconducting cuprates . </S>"
