    "real world network analysis has become a major issue of research in the last years .",
    "most prominent are perhaps the investigations of the structure of the world wide web , the network of internet routers , and certain social networks like citation networks . on the theoretical side ,",
    "one tries to understand the mechanisms of formation of such networks and to derive statistical properties of the networks from the generating rules . on the rigorous mathematical side",
    ", there are only a few results for specific models , indicating the difficulty of a purely mathematical approach ( for a survey of recent results in this direction , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the main approach is to use some mean field assumption to get relevant information about the corresponding graphs . although it is not clear where the limits of this approach lie , in many cases the results match well with numerical simulations and empirical data .    in this article , we study a particular collaboration network . its vertices are research projects funded by the european union and the organizations involved in those projects . in total",
    ", the data base contains over 20000 projects and 35000 participating organizations .",
    "the network shows all the main characteristics known from other complex network structures , such as scale - free degree distribution , small diameter , high clustering , and inhomogeneous vertex correlations .    besides the general interest in studying a new , real - world network of large size and high complexity , the study could have a significant economic impact . improving collaboration between actors involved in innovation processes is a key objective of current science , technology , and innovation policy in industrialized countries .",
    "however , very little is known about what kind of network structures emerge from such initiatives .",
    "moreover , it is quite likely that network structure affects network functions such as knowledge creation , knowledge diffusion , and the collaboration of particular types of actors .",
    "presumably , this is determined by both endogenous formation mechanisms and exogenous framework conditions . in order to progress in our understanding ,",
    "it is therefore essential to have sound statistics on the structure of networks we observe and to develop plausible models of how these are formed and evolve over time .    the model networks we use to compare with the empirical data are random intersection graphs , a natural framework for describing projections of bipartite graphs .",
    "discrete intersection graphs similar to the ones we use were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "we extend and refine the construction from @xcite to be more applicable to real world graphs .    perhaps the most important",
    "finding from our model approach is the strong determination of the real network structure by the degree distribution .",
    "that is , most statistical properties we measure in the eu research project networks are the ones observed in a typical realization of a uniform weighted random graph model with given ( bipartite ) degree distribution as in the eu networks . since this distribution is characterized by two exponents",
    " one for each partition  we have essentially only four parameters ( size , edge number , and exponents ) which are needed to describe the entire network .",
    "this is a tremendous reduction of complexity indicating that only a few basic formation rules are driving the network evolution .    in",
    ", we describe the preparation of the data on the eu research programs .",
    "we present empirical determination of the network properties in , followed by an explanation of these properties using a random intersection graph model in .",
    "finally , in , we summarize the key results and consider implications of the network properties on eu research programs .",
    "in this work , we study research collaboration networks that have emerged in the european union s first four successive four - year framework programs ( fps ) on research and technological development . since their inception in 1984 , six fps have been launched , on four of which we have comprehensive data .",
    "fps are organized in priority areas , which include information and communication technologies ( icts ) , energy , industrial technologies , life sciences , environment , transportation , and a number of additional activities . in line with economic structural change ,",
    "the main thematic focus of the fps has shifted somewhat over time from energy and industrial technologies to the application of icts and life sciences .",
    "the majority of funding activities are aimed at stimulating research partnerships between firms , universities , research organizations , governmental actors , ngos , lobby groups , etc .. since fp4 , the scope of activities has been expanded to also cover training , networking , demonstration , and preparatory activities ( for details , see reference @xcite ) . in order to keep our data set compatible over the different fps",
    ", we have excluded the latter set of projects from fp4 and only focus on collaborative research projects ( see ) .    in order to receive funding , projects in fp1 to fp4",
    "had to comprise at least two organizations from at least two member states .",
    "we have retrieved data on these projects from the publicly available cordis ( community research and development information service ) projects database @xcite .",
    "this database contains information on all funded projects as well as a reasonably complete listing of all participating organizations .",
    "the raw data on participating organizations is rather inconsistent .",
    "apart from incoherent spelling in up to four languages per country , organizations are labelled inhomogeneously .",
    "entries may range from large corporate groupings , such as siemens , or large public research organizations like the spanish csic to individual departments or labs and are listed as valid at the time the respective project was carried out . among heterogeneous organizations , only a subset contains information on the unit actually participating or on geographical location ( address , city , region and/or country ) .",
    "information on older entries and the substructure of firms tends to be less complete .    because of these difficulties , any automatic standardization method akin to the one utilized by newman @xcite is inappropriate to this kind of data .",
    "rather , the raw data has to be cleaned and completed manually , which is an ongoing project at arc systems research .",
    "the objective of this work is to produce a data set useful for policy advice by identifying homogeneous , economically meaningful organizational entities . to this end",
    ", organizational boundaries are defined by legal control and entries are assigned to the respective organizations .",
    "resulting heterogeneous organizations , such as universities , large research centres , or conglomerate firms are broken down into subentities that operate in fairly coherent areas of activity , such as faculties , institutes , divisions or subsidiaries .",
    "these can be identified for a large number of entries , based on the available contact information of participants , and are comparable across organizations .",
    "the case of the french centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) , the most active participant in the eu fps may serve as an illustration .",
    "first , 785 separate entries were summarized under a unique organizational label .",
    "next , these 785 entries were broken down into the eight areas of research activity in which cnrs is currently organized .",
    "based on available information on participating units and geographical location , 732 of the 785 entries could be assigned to one of these subentities . for the remaining 53 entries ,",
    "the nonspecific label cnrs was used .",
    "comparable success rates were achieved for other large public research organizations and universities . due to scarcer information",
    ", firms could not be broken down at a comparable rate . moreover , due to resource constraints , standardization work has focused on the major players in the fps .",
    "organizations participating in fewer than a total of 30 projects in fp14 have not been broken down yet . due to these limitations in processing the data ,",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of a bias in analysing our data .",
    "however , we have run all the reported analyses with the undivided organizations and have obtained qualitatively similar results , apart from different extreme values , e.g. , maximum degree .",
    "displays information on the present data set , which contains information on a total of 27,758 projects , carried out over the period 1984 to 2004 .",
    "it shows that the total budget as well as number of funded projects has increased dramatically from fp1 to fp4 .",
    "moreover , it provides a rough measure on the completeness of the available data . for a sizeable number of projects , the cordis project database lists information only on the project co - ordinator",
    "this is due to the age of the data and inhomogeneous disclosure policies of different units at the european commission .",
    "comparing the number of projects containing information on more than one participant with the total number of projects funded in each fp shows that the data is fairly complete as of fp2 .    the fact that fp1 was the first program launched and that the available data are rather incomplete make it exceptional in many respects .",
    "we therefore focus our analyses on fp24 and only give graph characteristic values for fp1 to indicate the difference to the networks created by the subsequent fps .",

    "there is a slight increase in the clustering coefficient of the o - graphs from fp1 to fp4 , indicating a stronger integration amongst groups of collaborating organizations .",
    "this is also reflected in the mean project size which increases from 2.4 to 6.2 .",
    "there is an interesting jump in the p - graph mean degree values and the mean triangle numbers between fp1 and 2 and between fp2 and 3 .",
    "the maximal degree of the o - graphs are very high in comparison with the mean degree , which is a consequence of the power law degree structure . for the p - graphs ,",
    "the gap between mean and maximal degree is less pronounced .    more information is contained in the statistical properties of the relevant distributions .",
    "the numerical data strongly indicate that the size distributions follow power laws . also , the o - graph degree distribution is of power - law type , while the project - graph degree distribution is a superposition of two scale free distributions , one dominating the distribution for small degree values ( up to 100 ) and one relevant for the large degree values .",
    "we discuss these properties at greater length in the following sections .",
    "the size distributions are the basic distributions for the eu - networks since , as will be shown in section , a typical sample from the random graph space with fixed size distributions like in fp 2 - 4 will have very similar statistical properties to fp 2 - 4 .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is essentially no additional correlation in the data once the size distribution is known .",
    "both the o - graph and p - graph size distributions show clear asymptotic power law distributions for fp14 ( ) . in terms of the corresponding bipartite graph , these are just the degree distributions of the project and organization partitions . while the o - graph size distribution is of power law type over the whole size range , the p - graph size distribution deviates strongly from the power - law for small size values . in ,",
    "we give a possible explanation for the appearance of the power law distribution for size .",
    "the numerical values for the exponents of the organization size distributions from fp24 are slightly below 2 , but constant within the error tolerance .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of organizations able to carry out a particular number of projects has not changed in the three framework programs .",
    "a complementary interpretation of this finding is that the underlying research activities , which we know to have changed over time , have not altered the mix of organizations participating in a particular number of projects in each framework program .",
    "it is further worth noting that the values of the o - graph exponents are close to the critical value 2 , hence the size expectation could diverge for large graphs ( whether the value is really below 2 or not is still unclear due to the error tolerance ) .",
    "the picture is similar for the p - graphs , although there are some differences in the initial behavior ( that is , for small project sizes ) and in the exponent value .",
    "the local minima at size 2 is decreasing from fp24 .",
    "this points to the existence of an optimal project size within the regime of the eu fps .",
    "moreover , the rise in the average project size indicates that increases in the available funding from fp2 to fp4 not only lead to more projects , but also slightly larger projects .",
    "this is consistent with recommendations from evaluation studies and the stated attempts of the eu commission to reduce its administrative burden . as a whole , the size distribution for the p - graphs matches in the asymptotic regime very well to a power law with exponent around -3 , hence indicating that the mechanisms for coagulation of organizations into a project did not greatly change from fp24 .",
    "since the degree distribution in the projection graphs is just the distribution of the size of the 2-neighborhood @xmath21 , it is not surprising that this quantity is closely connected to the size distribution . in the absence of other special correlations , it can be shown ( see ) that the degree distribution is determined by the size distribution in a rather simple way .",
    "namely , for the case when both size distributions are scale - free with exponents , say @xmath22 ( o - size ) and @xmath23 ( p - size ) , the p - graph degree distribution is a superposition of two power - law distributions with exponents @xmath24 ( and cutoff given by the maximal o - size value ) and @xmath23 .",
    "the same holds vice versa for the o - graph .    in",
    ", we show the degree - distribution for the p- and o - graphs in a log - log plot . .",
    "while the organization graphs for fp24 show a clear power law , the picture for the project graphs is more complicated .",
    "as previously mentioned , the p - graph degree distribution shows two different power laws , one for the initial segment up to degree 150 and another one for large degrees .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a widely scattered heavy tail in the degree distribution .",
    "the deviation from a power law in the p - graphs indicates a kind of anticorrelation : large projects above a size of 15 are mainly formed by organizations of small size .",
    "a possible explanation is that large projects have a time- and resource - demanding intrinsic network structure , making it more unlikely that a participating organization has other projects ( of course , with the exception of hub - like organizations such as cnrs with _ a priori _  unlimited capacity ) .              by their construction process ,",
    "intersection graphs have a naturally high clustering coefficient .",
    "this is easily seen , since an organization which participates in , say , @xmath25 projects generates a complete subgraph of order @xmath25 in the p - graph amongst these projects .",
    "if the probability for an organization to be in more than one project is asymptotically bound away from zero , it follows that the p - graph ( and similarly for the o - graph through an analogous argument ) has a nonvanishing clustering coefficient . in the present study",
    ", we focus on the triangle number @xmath26 as a measure of local clustering .",
    "we define the degree - conditional mean triangle number as @xmath27 .",
    "as seen in , we have @xmath28 for both graph types .",
    "there is a good explanation for this type of behavior in the framework of intersection graphs ( see ) . as noted above , high clustering in intersection graphs",
    "is not necessarily an indication of local correlations between vertices .",
    "this is already seen in the case of an erds - renyi random bipartite graph where an edge between any project and organization is drawn i.i.d .  with probability @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath3 are of equal cardinality @xmath9 and @xmath31 , the expected bipartite degree equals @xmath32 . for large",
    "@xmath9 a typical realization of the random graph looks locally like a tree with branching number @xmath33 .",
    "however , for the projection graphs , we obtain an positive clustering coefficient that is independent of @xmath9 , since most projects and organizations cause complete graphs of order @xmath32 and a typical vertex is therefore a member of @xmath34 cliques of order @xmath32 .    a better indication for the presence of correlations is given by the so - called multiplicity of edges . for a link between two organizations or projects",
    "it is sufficient to have just one project or organization , respectively , in common , but of course there could be more . given an edge @xmath35 , we define @xmath36 and call it the multiplicity of the edge .",
    "as will be discussed in the next section , random intersection graphs without local search rules can nevertheless admit a high edge multiplicity . in",
    ", the multiplicity distribution is shown for p- and o - graphs of fp24 .",
    "there is an almost perfect power - law behavior with exponent 4.3 .",
    "note that positive multiplicity in the projection graphs translates in the bipartite graph picture into the presence of cycles of length four .",
    "the presence of exceptionally high multiplicity in the p - graphs may be caused by memory effects due to prior collaborative experience . also , a greater edge multiplicity may result from the fact that organizations are active in a wider set of complementary activities . in this case ,",
    "intra - organizational spillovers may also be of importance as search for potential partners may be influenced by the collaboration behavior of other actors within an organization .",
    "such effects should be detectable from a fine structure analysis of the time evolution of the corresponding graphs .",
    "there is essentially no difference in the diameter value of the largest component in the four framework program networks . a classical random graph of the same size and the same edge number would have a diameter about @xmath37 .",
    "the mean path length is about a third of the diameter and and shows a slightly higher variation between the different framework programs .",
    "it is well known that the expected path length in random graphs with a scale free degree distribution and exponent less than 3 is essentially independent of the graph size ( the diameter of the largest component still increases in @xmath9 but only as @xmath38 ) .",
    "the same holds for random intersection graphs with power law size and degree distributions . since the the o - graphs seem to fall into that class , the almost constant diameter and path length is not surprising .",
    "although the p - graphs do not show an asymptotic power law structure for the degree , there is a strong increase in the edge density from fp2 to fp4 , keeping the diameter of the largest component almost fixed .",
    "intersection graphs are a natural framework for networks derived from a membership relation , such as citation networks , actors networks , or networks reflecting any other kind of cooperation .",
    "as previously mentioned , intersection graphs by construction have a high clustering coefficient .",
    "as explained below , the clique distribution of a random intersection graph is almost given by the size distribution of the dual graph .",
    "one of the simplest random intersection models is constructed in the following way . knowing the size of a set to be constructed , we generate a random subset from a finite base set @xmath39 of @xmath9 elements , such that each set element is drawn i.i.d .",
    "uniformly from @xmath40 . these subsets constitute the vertices of a random graph .",
    "edges are defined via the set intersection property , namely we have an edge between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( denoted by @xmath43 ) if and only if the associated subsets @xmath44 and @xmath45 have nonempty intersection ( to compare with earlier sections , @xmath46 stands here for either projects sets @xmath47 or organization sets @xmath48 ) .",
    "the size ( cardinality ) of the subsets is either itself a random variable drawn i.i.d . from a probability distribution @xmath49 or given by a list @xmath50 ( where for each @xmath41 a conditional random choice is made to which size class it belongs ) . for the latter case ,",
    "we define again @xmath51 where @xmath11 is the total number of sets to be formed .",
    "since we want to compare the model with the eu- cooperation network we are mainly interested in the situation when @xmath52 is an asymptotic power law distribution @xmath53 this assumption is also reasonable for many other applications where vertices are formed from a base set of elements . to obtain an interesting limiting random graph space",
    ", we further assume that the number of chosen subsets is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is neither too large nor too small ( for fp24 we have about twice as many organization as projects hence hence @xmath55 is either @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) .",
    "a basic quantity for the analysis of intersection graphs is the conditional edge probability given the size of two subsets : @xmath58 using the condition @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath60 with this result , we can easily calculate the conditional degree distribution for a vertex of given size .",
    "first , we estimate the conditional subdegree distribution with respect to a given group of vertices of size @xmath61 here , the subdegree @xmath62 of a vertex @xmath41 is defined as the number of edges @xmath41 has with vertices of size @xmath61 clearly @xmath63 we have @xmath64 the probability that a randomly chosen vertex @xmath42 has size @xmath65 equals , by assumption , @xmath66 with normalization constant @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath69 which converges to a poisson distribution @xmath70 with @xmath71 since the distribution @xmath72 of the degree of vertices @xmath41 with @xmath73 is the convolution of the poisson distributions @xmath74 , we obtain again a poisson distribution for @xmath72 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a well defined constant since @xmath78 it remains to estimate the total degree distribution @xmath79 . in @xcite , conditions were given describing when a superposition of poisson distributions results in a scale - free distribution .",
    "specifically , we get the following asymptotic estimate:@xmath80 the main contribution to @xmath81 comes from a rather small interval of @xmath65-values , called @xmath82 .",
    "this interval has the property that for @xmath83 , the expectation @xmath84 is of order @xmath85 the exponential decay of the poisson distribution guarantees that the remaining parts of the sum become arbitrarily small for large @xmath25 .",
    "it is important that the constant @xmath86 has a linear @xmath87dependence since an @xmath87proportionality with exponent larger than one would force the degree distribution to have gaps due to a lack of overlap of the individual poisson distributions .",
    "we therefore obtain for the degree distribution a power law with the same exponent @xmath22 as in the size distribution .",
    "although the intersection model gives a power - law degree distribution when the size distribution is already of power - law type , we will not obtain a power - law distribution for the size on the dual graph unless additional assumptions are made on the set formation rules .",
    "it is easy to see that the size distribution on the dual graph is asymptotically poisson .",
    "since @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 converges as well as @xmath91 for @xmath92 , we obtain in the limit a poisson distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the degree distribution on the dual graph still admits a scale - free part induced by the scale - free size distribution of the intersection graph .",
    "we will not discuss many of the details , but instead provide a simple estimation for the lower bound on the number of elements @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "namely , the number of elements @xmath93 which are members of sets @xmath45 with @xmath95 is for large @xmath25 and @xmath96 about @xmath97 . since @xmath98 for @xmath99 with @xmath100",
    ", we obtain @xmath101 as a lower bound on the density of elements @xmath93 with degree greater than or equal to @xmath25 ( note that we assumed @xmath102 ) .",
    "this estimate holds of course only up to the maximal size value @xmath25 , which is in the range of the power law distribution for the set sizes @xmath103 for larger @xmath25-values there is a rapid exponential decay .",
    "the last argument clarifies also the situation when one wants to impose conditions on the size distribution and the dual size distribution .",
    "without going into the details of the rather involved analysis , we simply state that the resulting degree distribution is given by a superposition of the size distibution and the dual size distribution ( the last one enters with an exponent reduced by one ) .",
    "this explains essentially the picture for the degree distribution for the p - graph .",
    "finally we want to discuss the mean triangle ( conditioned on the degree ) - degree dependence which shows a clear linear behavior in the empirical data .",
    "we argue that this is again a consequence of the power law distribution for the size .",
    "first observe that a size @xmath25 element @xmath99 induces a @xmath104 complete subgraph on the neighborhood vertices of @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , each maximal @xmath105clique in which @xmath45 is a member generates @xmath106 triangles for @xmath45 . since the size distribution of the elements @xmath93 is poisson with expectation of , say , @xmath32 and the degree of @xmath45 is proportional to the size @xmath107 , we obtain for the conditional expected number of triangles @xmath108 given the degree @xmath25:@xmath109 in deriving , we used the facts that with high probability the size of the intersection between two sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 has cardinality @xmath110 ( conditioned on the two sets having a nonempty intersection ) and that the poisson distribution has an exponentially decaying tail .",
    "we sketch the construction of random intersection graphs with given size distribution @xmath52 and size distribution @xmath111 on the dual .",
    "the two distributions are not independent but have to fulfill the condition @xmath112   = 0 $ ] .",
    "there are further restrictions on the maximal size in order to get a reasonable random graph model .",
    "note that the problem is equivalent to the construction of a random bipartite graph given the degree sequence on the two partitions .",
    "assign first to each set @xmath46 and each element @xmath113 from the base set a random size value according to the given distributions @xmath52 and @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the resulting set of elements @xmath93 with size @xmath25 .",
    "replace each element from @xmath114 by @xmath25 virtual elements @xmath115 and form a new base set @xmath116 with all the virtual elements . the set formation process for the sets @xmath117 is now the same as in the previous section except that each chosen virtual element @xmath118 will be removed from @xmath116 when it was selected first into a set .",
    "after the sets are constructed we identify the virtual elements back into the original ones and define the corresponding set graph in the usual way .    by construction the resulting size distribution on the dual graph",
    "will be given by @xmath111 as long as the probability of choosing two virtual elements @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( corresponding to the same element @xmath93 ) is sufficiently small .",
    "to ensure this one has to impose restrictions on the maximal size values .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the correlation between the size of @xmath46 and the size of an element @xmath113 is multiplicative . in case of a linear relation between the number of sets @xmath9 and the number of elements @xmath11 we have @xmath120 to see this",
    "observe that@xmath121{c}\\text{among the } k\\text { choices to generate } a\\\\ \\text { is no virtual } a-\\text { element}\\end{array } \\right\\ }   \\\\ &   = 1-\\frac{m^{\\ast}-l}{m^{\\ast}}\\cdot\\frac{m^{\\ast}-1-l}{m^{\\ast}-1}\\cdot ...",
    "\\cdot\\frac{m^{\\ast}-k - l+1}{m^{\\ast}-k+1}\\ ] ] with @xmath122 being the number of virtual elements .",
    "the last formula has the same structure as the expression for the pairing probability in the previous section hence we get , for @xmath123 and bounded first moments of the @xmath111-distribution , the claimed multiplicative correlation .",
    "we note that there is also a variant of the molloy - reed construction which produces an additive size - size correlation such that @xmath124 holds ( see @xcite for details of the algorithm ) .",
    "we next present a simulation - based comparison of the multiplicative and additive molley - reed model with the fp4 network .",
    "the input size distributions for the molloy - reed simulations are the same as in fp4 . for completeness",
    "we also include the simulation results based on the simple random intersection graph model defined in the previous section .",
    "to make clear which size distribution is given in that case we use the notation p - model ( o - model ) for the intersection graph with fixed p ( o ) size distribution and denote by po - model the corresponding molloy - reed graphs since both size distributions are fixed therein .",
    "show the degree distribution for the o- and p - graphs .",
    "there is a very good agreement over the whole range of degree values between the real fp4 network projections and typical samples of the multiplicative molloy - reed model .",
    "this is quite remarkable since a considerable bias from the almost independence of the molloy - reed model should be visible in the degree distributions .",
    "the fact that there is no deviation between the degree distributions indicates that the majority of project - organization alignments is essentially a random process .",
    "furthermore , the additive model reproduces the fp4 p - graph degree distribution only well for large degree values indicating that the correlation is indeed multiplicative .",
    "two quantities measuring local correlations are the triangle - degree dependence and the distribution of edge multiplicity introduced earlier .",
    "compares the triangle - degree correlation for the o - graph .",
    "although the overall picture is similar ( linear dependence up to medium degree ) there is a clear tendency for higher triangle numbers in fp4 for large degree values .",
    "again the multiplicative version matches better with the data then the additive model . the edge multiplicity ",
    "again for the o - graphs  is shown in .",
    "the real graph has a considerably smaller value in the exponent and extends to almost twice as large a maximal multiplicity value .",
    "nevertheless , both molloy - reed models show a sharp scale - free distribution for the multiplicity .",
    "this is quite surprising , since , naively , one would expect the probability for positive edge multiplicity to go to zero as @xmath9 becomes large . in summary , one has a strong agreement between the real data and the multiplicative molloy - reed model ( the comparison results for fp2 and fp3 are almost identical to the situation with fp4 and have therefore not been depicted here ) . only in the fine structure of clustering characteristics are some differences observed .            finally , we briefly outline why , under certain circumstances , almost independent models like the molloy - reed one can have a scale - free edge - multiplicity distribution . to keep the discussion as transparent as possible , we study the question in a pure bipartite bernoulli model , which can be thought of as a kind of predecessor to the cameo - model discussed below .    to each vertex from the o- and p- partitions ( with cardinality @xmath9 and @xmath11 ) , we assign a power - law distributed , positive integer parameter @xmath125 and @xmath126 with exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "that is we partition the p- and o - vertices into sets @xmath127  and @xmath128 such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are normalization constants .",
    "we further assume @xmath133 and put @xmath134 it is easy to see that the expected degree , conditioned on the @xmath135 or @xmath136 value , is proportional to @xmath135 or @xmath137 respectively , and therefore the ( bipartite ) degree distribution on each partition has the same exponent as @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "note that the maximal @xmath135 and @xmath136 values are given by @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "since the edge multiplicity in the projection graph corresponds to the number of paths of length @xmath56 in the bipartite graph , we define @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xmath142 for fixed @xmath47 and @xmath143 with parameters @xmath135 and @xmath144 the expected number of paths of lenght @xmath56 between the two vertices is given by @xmath145 and therefore the expected total number of @xmath56 paths in the @xmath47-partition is @xmath146 on the other hand , we have for the probability of an edge between @xmath47 and @xmath143 in the p - projection graph the estimate @xmath147 and hence for the expected total number of edges @xmath148 @xmath149 several cases are now possible . for @xmath150 and @xmath102 , it is easy to see that @xmath151 and higher edge multiplicities have essentially zero probability .",
    "the situation is different if either condition is violated , since in this case @xmath152 diverges and can become of the same order as @xmath153 for instance , we obtain for @xmath154 @xmath155   ^{k}\\\\ &   \\simeq\\sum\\limits_{\\mu,\\mu^{\\prime}}^{\\mu_{\\max}}\\frac{const\\cdot m^{2}}{\\left (   \\mu\\mu^{\\prime}\\right )   ^{\\alpha}}\\sum_{k\\geq2}\\frac{\\left ( -1\\right )   ^{k}}{k!}\\left [   const\\cdot\\mu\\mu^{\\prime}m^{\\frac{3}{\\beta}-2}\\right ]   ^{k}\\\\ &   \\simeq\\sum_{k\\geq2}const\\cdot\\frac{\\left (   -1\\right )   ^{k}}{k!}m^{\\frac { 2}{\\alpha}+k\\left (   \\frac{3}{\\beta}+\\frac{2}{\\alpha}-2\\right )   } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the last formula , we see that the expected edge multiplicity @xmath156 can become positive for proper choices of @xmath22 and @xmath157 we show that @xmath158 under the above assumptions . since @xmath159 and @xmath160 one gets @xmath161 since the involved constant is positive we get the desired result . a more carefully analysis , which will be part of a forthcoming paper , shows that one also obtains a power law for the edge multiplicity , as observed in the simulations .      in this section , we give a possible explanation for the appearance of power laws in the size distribution . in most models of complex networks with power - law like degree distributions , one assumes a kind of preferential attachment rule as in the albert and barabasi model .",
    "this makes little sense in our framework .",
    "instead we propose a rule called the `` cameo principle '' first formulated in @xcite .    before giving an interpretation and motivation",
    "we briefly describe the formal setting .",
    "assign to each project a positive @xmath52 distributed random variable ( r.v . )",
    "@xmath162 and to each organization a positive @xmath163 distributed r.v .",
    "@xmath135 ( note that , in contrast to , @xmath52 and @xmath111 are not the size distributions ) .",
    "we assume @xmath52 and @xmath111 to be supported on @xmath164 and monotone decaying as @xmath162 and @xmath135 tend to infinity . on the bipartite graph an edge between an organization o and a project p is then formed with probability @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are positive constants , @xmath168 , and all edges are drawn independently of one another .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the corresponding random p and o - graphs for typical realizations of the @xmath162 and @xmath135 variable .",
    "the word typical is here understood in the sense of the ergodic theorem , namely we assume @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath9 and @xmath11 are the cardinalities of the o- and p - partitions and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are such that the integral is bounded .",
    "the above formula reduces then to@xmath171 the expected conditional size of a vertex is then given by @xmath172 and @xmath173    the interpretation behind the special form of edge probability in is the following .",
    "the @xmath162 and @xmath135 values describe a kind of attractivity property inherent to projects and organizations .",
    "thinking in terms of a virtual project formation process the final set of organizations belonging to a project @xmath47 can either join the project actively  in which case the @xmath135 value of @xmath47 is important  or the organization more passively enters the project on the request of organizations already involved  in which case the attractivity @xmath162 of the the corresponding organization is important .",
    "the attractivity of an organization could , for instance , be related to its reputation , financial strength , or quality of earlier projects in which the organization was involved . extrapolating from human behavior ,",
    "it is not directly the @xmath162 or @xmath135 value which enters the pairing probability , but rather the relative frequency of the @xmath162 or @xmath135 values : the rarer a property , the more attractive it becomes .",
    "this is in essence the content of the `` cameo '' principle .    the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be seen as a kind of affinity to following the above rule ; for @xmath174 the rule is switched off and we recover a classical erds - renyi intersection graph .",
    "in general the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are themselves quenched random variables with their own  usually unknown  distribution .",
    "as shown in @xcite , only the maximal @xmath22 and @xmath23 values matter for the resulting degree distribution of the graphs .",
    "we therefore restrict ourself in the following to constant values .",
    "since the conditional expectation of the size values ( ) are proportional to @xmath175 and @xmath176 , we have to estimate their induced distribution .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath177 is asymptotically distributed with density @xmath178 when @xmath179 decays monotone and faster than any power law to zero as @xmath180 .",
    "when @xmath181 is itself a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath182 , the resulting distribution for @xmath183 will be @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , the induced distribution is always a power law and independent of the details of @xmath185 . applying this result to our model ,",
    "we obtain immediately a power law distribution for the size distribution on the p- and o - graphs with exponents depending essentially only on @xmath22 and @xmath157 it is not difficult to see that , due to the edge independence in the model definition , the resulting degree distributions are again of power - law type . the cameo _",
    "ansatz _ hence generates in a natural way a bipartite graph , where both projections admit two of the main features of the fp - networks .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a linear dependence of the mean triangle number @xmath108 on the degree , as in .    none of the models discussed in section iv can reproduce scale - free distribution of the edge multiplicity with the same low exponent as observed in each of the fp networks",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the inclusion of memory effects like the `` my friends are your friends '' principle @xcite will change the picture .",
    "in this work , we have described research collaboration networks determined from research projects funded by the european union .",
    "the networks are large in terms of size , complexity , and economic impact .",
    "we observed numerous characteristics known from other complex networks , including scale - free degree distribution , small diameter , and high clustering . using a random intersection - graph model",
    ", we were able to reproduce many properties of the actual networks .",
    "the empirical and theoretical investigations together shed light on the properties of these complex networks , in particular that the eu - funded r&d networks match well with typical realizations of random graph models characterized by just four parameters : the size , edge number , exponent of project - projection degree distribution , and exponent of organization - projection degree distribution .    in terms of real - world interpretation , the present analysis yields three major insights .",
    "first , based on the fact that the size distribution of projects did not change significantly between the framework programs , any possible changes in project formation rules  which we do not know at this stage  did not affect the aggregate structure of the resulting research networks .",
    "second , the fact that integration between collaborating organizations has increased over time , as measured by the average clustering coefficient , indicates that europe has already been moving towards a more closely integrated european research area in the earlier framework programs .",
    "finally , the fact that a sizeable number of organizations collaborate more than once in each frame program shows that there appears to be a kind of robust backbone structure in place , which may constitute the core of the european research area .    in terms of application ,",
    "the present results suggest a number of extensions .",
    "first , it is essential to learn more about the properties of the vertices in our networks . to what extent",
    "can they be characterized and classified ?",
    "what kind of structural patterns emerge if we add this information ?",
    "second , we need to know more about the micro - structure of the networks .",
    "in which areas are the networks highly clustered and where does this clustering come from ? what kind of subgroups can be identified ?",
    "third , we need to learn more about where the observed distribution of edge multiplicity comes from .",
    "finally , it would be desirable to explicitly include edge weights into the analysis .",
    "presumable , actors who collaborate more frequently are more proximate to each other than actors who collaborate only once .",
    "this may significantly impact the structural features we are able to observe , as well as the conclusions we might draw concerning the link between network structure and function .    we would like to acknowledge support from the portuguese fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ( bolsa de investigao sfrh / bpd/9417/2002 and feder / pocti - sfa-1 - 219 ) , arc systems research ( w4570000294 - 3 ) , and from the vw stiftung ( i/80496 ) .",
