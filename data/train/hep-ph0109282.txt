    "the @xmath197 values listed in this table were obtained from directly fitting the peterson function to the measured differential cross - section @xmath218 .",
    "we note from table [ rpp00-tab.36.1 ] that the mass dependence of @xmath197 is less marked than the dependence on the orbital angular momentum structure of the charmed hadron being measured .",
    "orbitally excited @xmath219 charmed hadrons ( @xmath220 , @xmath221 , and @xmath222 , @xmath223 ) show consistently harder spectra ( , smaller values of @xmath197 ) than the @xmath224 ground states , whereas the data for the ground state charmed baryons @xmath225 and @xmath226 show agreement with the lighter ( by @xmath227-@xmath228 mev ) ground - state @xmath229 and @xmath230 charmed mesons . to some extent",
    ", the harder spectra of @xmath219 hadrons can be attributed to the fact that all the @xmath219 charmed hadrons will eventually decay into @xmath224 hadrons .",
    "experimental studies of the fragmentation function for @xmath74 quarks have been performed at lep and sld @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bfrag ] .",
    "[ fig - bfrag ] measured @xmath8 fragmentation function of @xmath74 quarks into @xmath231 hadrons @xcite .",
    "@xmath231 hadrons are commonly identified by their semileptonic decays or by their decay vertex reconstructed from the charged particles emerging from the @xmath231 decay .",
    "the most recent results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are in agreement .",
    "both studies fit the @xmath231 spectrum using a monte carlo shower model supplemented with non - perturbative fragmentation functions to fit their data .",
    "the experiments measure primarily the spectrum of @xmath231 meson .",
    "this defines a fragmentation function which includes the effect of the decay of higher mass excitations , like the @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "there is an ambiguity in the definition of the fragmentation function , which has to do with what is considered to be a final state hadron .",
    "one may prefer to distinguish @xmath231 meson produced directly from those arising from decays of @xmath232 and @xmath233 , and define @xmath234 where the notation @xmath235 stands for directly produced .",
    "the fragmentation function which is directly measured from the @xmath231 mesons , irrespective of their origin , is instead given by @xmath236 where ( for example ) @xmath237 stands for the probability for a fast @xmath233 to decay to @xmath231 with a fraction @xmath238 of its energy .",
    "thus , in order to extract @xmath239 from @xmath240 a correction factor should be computed , which gives a harder fragmentation function . thus ,",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite obtains the value @xmath241 ; postulating a @xmath232 fraction of 0.75 , one gets @xmath242 ; postulating a @xmath233 fraction of 0.25 yields @xmath243 .    besides degrading the fragmentation function by gluon radiation",
    ", qcd evolution can also generate soft heavy quarks , increasing in the small @xmath2 region as @xmath18 increases .",
    "this effect has been studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one important issue is to understand how often @xmath244 or @xmath245 pairs are produced indirectly , via a gluon splitting mechanism .",
    "several theoretical studies are available on this topic @xcite .",
    "experimental studies on charm production via gluon splitting have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , and measurements of @xmath246 have been given in @xcite .",
    "the reported values are given in table  [ tab : gqq ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an explicit calculation of these quantities has been performed . using these results charm and bottom multiplicities for different values of the masses and of @xmath247",
    "were computed in @xcite .",
    "they are reported in table  [ tab : gqq ] . as can be seen ,",
    "charm measurements are somewhat in excess of the predictions .",
    "the averaged experimental result for charm , @xmath248% , is 1 - 2 standard deviations outside the range of the theoretical prediction , preferring lower values of the quark mass and/or a larger value of @xmath247 .",
    "however , higher - order corrections may well be substantial at the charm quark mass scale .",
    "better agreement is achieved for bottom .    as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , monte carlo models are in qualitative agreement with these results , although the spread of the values they obtain is somewhat larger than the theoretical error estimated by the direct calculation . in particular , for charm one finds that while herwig @xcite and jetset @xcite agree quite well with the theoretical calculation , ariadne @xcite is higher by roughly a factor of 2 , and thus is in better agreement with data . for bottom ,",
    "agreement between theory , models and data is adequate . for a detailed discussion",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with the charm prediction may be due to experimental cuts forcing the final state configuration to be more 3-jet like , which increases the charm multiplicity .",
