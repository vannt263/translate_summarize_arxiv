    "our interest is in the description of the precursor fluctuations in the metallic state of a one dimensional system , at temperatures above the mean - field ordering temperature . for a single mode instability in the weak coupling regime",
    "this is well described by rpa . upon the approach of the mean - field transition ,",
    "the fluctuations slow down and in the vicinity of the transition the characteristic frequency of the collective fluctuations becomes less than temperature .",
    "it was demonstrated by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) that under these circumstances the time dependence of the collective modes can be omitted and instead of calculating the full quantum - mechanical trace a classical average suffices .",
    "let us now consider the hubbard hamiltonian with @xmath10 , written in the fermionic second - quantized operators @xmath11 :    @xmath12    using @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermion density and @xmath15 the @xmath16-component of the fermion spin . the interaction term can be decoupled by the hubbard - stratanovich transformation , @xmath17 = { 1 \\over { \\pi u } } \\int d\\rho_i d m_i exp [ - \\frac{1}{u } ( \\rho_i^2 + m_i^2 ) + i \\rho_i \\hat n_i + 2 m_i s^z_i ] \\ ; , \\label{hubstra}\\ ] ] introducing two auxiliary fields , describing the collective charge- ( @xmath18 ) and spin ( @xmath19 ) fluctuations , respectively .",
    "it is noted that at temperatures larger than the mean - field transition only spin amplitude fluctuations matter and difficulties @xcite related to the apparent violation of the global @xmath20 invariance by eq .",
    "( [ hubstra ] ) are of no importance .",
    "conventionally , one proceeds by neglecting the charge sector completely , except for the @xmath21 static component of the charge mode causing a shift of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "however , since the coupling of the charge- and spin modes is important at low temperatures the question arises how to deal with these couplings in the precursor regime . starting with a uniform state , it is not easy to keep track of these mode couplings perturbatively .",
    "we assume that both the charge- and spin mode condense at the mean - field transition where the dynamics in both sectors slow down and the quasi static approximation can be applied to either the spin- or the charge modes , or both .",
    "since the spin modes dominate the instability , they should be integrated out as accurately as possible ( using rpa ) which leaves the charge modes to be taken as the static ones . neglecting subdominant charge - charge mode couplings , the trace in the partition functional @xmath22 can be taken over independent charge modes with wave vector @xmath23 and amplitude @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the partition sum can be approximated as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the partition function describing the dynamics in the presence of the static charge density waves : @xmath28}z_{m } ( \\rho(\\delta_c ) , \\delta_c ) \\right\\ } \\times \\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\left\\{\\displaystyle \\int { \\cal d } \\ , m_{i}(\\tau)\\displaystyle\\exp{\\left[-\\int_{0}^{\\beta } \\sum_{i}\\frac{m_{i}^{2}(\\tau)}{4u}d\\tau\\right]}\\right\\}^{-1}\\label{zrho}\\\\ z_{m } ( \\rho(\\delta_c ) , \\delta_c ) & = & tr \\displaystyle \\left\\ { \\exp{[-\\beta h_{o}(\\rho(\\delta_c ) , \\delta_c)]}t_{\\tau}\\displaystyle   \\exp{\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\beta}\\sum_{i } [ m_{i}(\\tau)\\hat{s}^{z}_{i}(\\tau)]d\\tau\\displaystyle \\right ) }   \\right\\ } \\label{zrho1}\\\\   h_{o}(\\rho(\\delta_c ) , \\delta_c ) & = & \\displaystyle   -t\\sum_{<i , j>,\\sigma}{a}_{i,\\sigma}^{\\dagger } a_{j,\\sigma } - \\tilde{\\mu}\\sum_{i}\\hat{n}_{i } + u\\sum_{i}\\rho_{i}(\\hat{n_{i}}- n)/2 + \\frac{u}{4}\\sum_{i}\\rho_{i}^{2 } \\label{hrho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is given by eq .",

    "( [ rhodef]-[hrho ] ) are a good approximation when the following conditions are satisfied simultaneously : ( i ) the characteristic frequencies of the charge fluctuations should be less than @xmath33 , ( ii ) charge - charge mode couplings can be neglected , ( iii ) the modes eq .",
    "( [ rhodef ] ) exhaust the partition sum in so far the collective charge sector is involved .",
    "conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) are both controlled by the slowing down associated with the mean - field transition .",
    "although close to the transition it is expected that the fundamental charge- and spin harmonics dominate the thermodynamics , this is not necessarily the case on microscopic scales , and condition ( ii ) limits the validity of our approach to the weak coupling regime .",
    "self - evidently , because the most important ( charge - spin ) mode coupling is treated explicitely , the above is a considerable improvement over conventional single - mode weak coupling theory , allowing us to penetrate deeper into the intermediate coupling regime .      in this section",
    "we will further elaborate on the formalism .",
    "however , the central outcome of our analysis can already be qualitatively understood at this point : pairs of charge- and spin fluctuations with special relationships between their momenta are _ simultaneously _ enhanced in the approach to the transition .",
    "these include the @xmath7-spin and @xmath9 charge fluctuations reminescent of the stripe fluctuations in cuprates .",
    "in addition , there is actually an infinite progression of these pairs , although the enhancement factors rapidly decrease upon going to higher orders .",
    "the mechanism is straightforward @xcite : by repeated umklapp scatterings against the cdw , a non-@xmath34 sdw can ` borrow ' the momentum mismatch with regard to the @xmath34 nesting vector from the cdw .",
    "obviously , this can only happen if special relations exist between the wave vectors of the sdw and cdw .",
    "close to the transition , the spin fluctuation can be considered as static , as the static charge density wave eq .",

    "the two terms in the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ spindef ] ) have a straightforward meaning .",
    "the first one arises due to the back - scattering of the fermion with a momentum change of @xmath37 , while the second term comes from umklapp scattering with a total momentum change @xmath38 . on the other hand , assuming linear fermion dispersions the fermi - momentum can be written in the proximity of half - filling as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( hole ) doping concentration ( at half - filling , @xmath41 ) .",
    "we have introduced intentionally three different momenta : @xmath42 , the deviation of @xmath43 from its half - filled value , and the wavectors associated with the modulation of the nel state ( @xmath44 ) and with the charge modulation ( @xmath23 ) , respectively . only in the absence of the cdw ,",
    "the sdw wave vector @xmath37 equals @xmath45 . in the presence of the cdw , however , a whole variety of new possibilities arises . according to eq .",
    "( [ hrho ] ) , the fermion momentum is conserved only _ modulo _",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , ... , because of the presence of the periodic potential produced by the cdw .",
    "this adds new umklapp scattering vectors , which are linear combinations of the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 may now differ from either @xmath37 or @xmath50 by an integer number of cdw wave vectors : @xmath51 ; @xmath52 . notice that the summation over @xmath30 is restricted to positive integers to avoid redundancy in the counting of the allowed sdw wave vectors .",

    "it is instructive to consider how these ` matching pair ' fluctuations arise in the present calculation .",
    "the key is that the cdw fluctuations with a ` matching ' wave vector lead to a selective enhancement of the spin density fluctuations with proper momenta .",

    "in fact this assertion is incorrect .",
    "here we demonstrate that in 1d even in a weak coupling limit , @xmath178 , the spin - charge modes coupling is relevant at small doping @xmath40 , i.e. close to half - filling of electron band ( @xmath179 electron per lattice site ) .",
    "the mechanism is genuinely novel @xcite and is related to interference phenomenon involving multiple scatterings of electrons by inverse lattice wave - vector and by wave - vector of self - consistently generated charge density mode ( cdw ) .",
    "essential role of the umklapp scattering makes this phenomenon strongly doping - dependent as distinguished from welknown phenomenon of related @xmath49-sdw and @xmath180-cdw fluctuations in a luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "recently the landau free - energy functional was phenomenologicallly introduced @xcite , which contains a leading order mode coupling term between the fundamental fourier components of the spin ( @xmath181 ) and charge ( @xmath182 ) order parameters :    @xmath183+\\quad \\text{quartic terms } \\label{zek}\\ ] ]    with condition imposed : @xmath184 . here",

    "<S> motivated by the stripe developments in cuprates , we review some analytical results of our studies of the charge- and spin density modulations ( cdw and sdw ) in a weakly coupled one dimensional repulsive electron system on a lattice . it is shown that close to half filling , in the high temperature regime above the mean field transition temperature , short range repulsions favor charge density fluctuations with wave vectors bearing special relations with those of the spin density fluctuations . in the low temperature regime , not only the wave vectors , but also the mutual phases of the cdw and sdw become coupled due to a quantum interference phenomenon , leading to the stripe phase instability in a quasi one - dimensional repulsive electron system . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that away from half filling periodic lattice potential causes cooperative condensation of the spin and charge superlattices . </S>",
    "<S> `` switching off '' this potential causes vanishing of the stripe order . </S>",
    "<S> the leading spin - charge coupling term in the effective landau functional is derived microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> results of the 1d renormalization group ( parquet ) analysis away from half filling are also presented , which indicate transient - scale correlations resembling the mean - field pattern . </S>",
    "<S> farther , the self - consistent solution for the spin - charge solitonic superstructure in a quasi - one - dimensional electron system is obtained in the framework of the hubbard model as a function of hole doping and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> possible relationship with the stripe phase correlations observed in high @xmath0 cuprates is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> stripe phases recently observed in doped antiferromagnets ( cuprates and nickelates ) @xcite attract attention to the problem of multi - mode instabilities in the interacting electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical mean - field calculations and phenomenological considerations @xcite suggest a universality of the spin - charge mode coupling phenomenon in repulsive electronic systems of different dimensionalities . </S>",
    "<S> hence , analytical mean - field solutions of the multi - mode ordering in 1d system could be revealing with respect to the mechanism of the mode coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field solutions would be essentially dimensional - independent and stabilized in three dimensional model by inter - layer interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this review is aimed at discussing some of such solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering experiments in doped cuprates and nickelates reveal pronounced dynamical spin fluctuations centered at the wave vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( in units of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the lattice constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are accompanied by dynamical ` charge ' ( crystal lattice ) fluctuations at wave vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic wave vectors of spin and charge are harmonically related via the doping dependent parameter @xmath7 , indicating that mode - couplings are important . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the static stripe phases show the same harmonic relations between the spin- and charge ordering wave vectors , thus confirming an idea that spin - charge mode coupling is a necessary condition for these phases to exist . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments demonstrate @xcite that at least in cuprates one has also to deal with the coupling to a pairing mode . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed @xcite that the stripe phase might be a quantum liquid crystal state of electrons possessing at the same time a charge- , antiferromagnetic- , and a superconducting condensates .    since the stripes have to do with a _ multi - mode _ instability </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental discovery of static stripes and dynamical stripe fluctuations in cuprates and other doped transition metal oxides @xcite put forward the following theoretical problem : a theory characterized by coupled modes must be extracted from a ( microscopic ) model of an interacting electron system .    </S>",
    "<S> stripe - like instabilities do show up in a variety of theoretical approaches , some of them even preceding the experimental discoveries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of these approaches @xcite have in common that they deal with the strong coupling regime at zero temperature , while they rest entirely on numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> to succeed in the same direction analytically , a microscopic model with weakly interacting electron - quasiparticles has been chosen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a model , in order to get at a mean - field ordering transition one limits himself to systems exhibiting near to perfect fermi surface nesting characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> this actually implies the choice of only one dimensional ( 1d ) systems .    at first glance </S>",
    "<S> , one may argue here that the infrared fixed point structure of 1d interacting electron systems is well understood @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it is well established that the zero temperature luttinger liquid exhibits algebraic long range order in both the spin- and the charge sectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the evidence is growing @xcite that existing picture is not yet complete . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it is very probable that close to half - filling and for relatively weak interactions the ground state is nothing else than a 1d stripe phase , with a long range order which is destroyed by a marginal quantum fluctuations of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is actually well established , that on the classical level the ground state in this regime is a stripe phase , since the mean - field analysis of schulz @xcite for 2d stripes rests on the nesting features which relate these results with ( in depth ) a 1d effect . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics is involved , as usual , in admixing of the goldstone modes of the classical state in the ground state , causing in turn the algebraic long range order .    </S>",
    "<S> this review consists of the four main parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first two parts deal with just the two `` main '' charge- and spin harmonics coupling , while the third and the fourth parts allow for all the rest `` obertones '' selfconsistently , thus introducing solitonic superstructures of the electronic charge and spin . before coming to the body of the derivations , </S>",
    "<S> let us make a short outline of the four parts in a more detailed fashion .    </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of the approach used in @xcite and described below lies in that instead of the conventional expansion in terms of a ( small ) coupling constant between electrons , one expands perturbatively in the coupling strengths between the different spin- and charge modes . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> the classical nature of the dynamics of the collective modes is used , which has a range of validity in a temperature interval around @xmath8 - the mean - field transition temperature into the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction strength between the electrons translates into strength of mode couplings . for relatively weak interactions and `` high '' temperatures </S>",
    "<S> one expects on physical grounds a _ hierarchy _ of mode couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant coupling is found between the fundamental spin- and charge modes , just as the @xmath7 spin- and @xmath9 charge modes of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> higher order couplings are responsible for the `` solitonic appearance '' of the stripe ground state , discussed in the last part of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> then , considering the coupled spin- and charge fluctuations above @xmath8 , it is possible to integrate out spin ( sdw ) fluctuations in the presence of the relevant charge ( cdw ) fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an effective free energy of the system does posses deep _ local _ minima at finite cdw amplitudes with the different wave vectors , but the _ global _ minimum still corresponds to no cdw at all .    in the second part , </S>",
    "<S> results of the paper @xcite are presented , which directly demonstrate appearance of the global minimum of the free energy at finite cdw ( and sdw ) amplitude below @xmath8 when the mutual phase of the coupled charge- and spin modes is locked for a constructive interference to occur . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a _ quantum interference mechanism _ of the stripe phase ordering proposed in @xcite is described . in order to carry discussion somewhat beyond the mean - field approach , a new modification of the 1d ( `` parquet '' ) renormalization group technique </S>",
    "<S> is described , which was first applied in @xcite to the case of coupled charge and spin fluctuations incommensurate with the crystal lattice away from half filling . as one would expect on the basis of the well known results for 1d systems mentioned above @xcite-@xcite , there is no four - leg vertex divergence found away from commensurability point in the cdw or sdw channels alone . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , introduction of the infinitesimal vertices with the new `` umklapp wave vector '' @xmath9 , brought by the incommensurate cdw mode , causes divergence of the four - leg vertices , thus indicating transient - scale correlations resembling the mean - field stripe pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> the last two parts of the review contain results published in @xcite , as well as the new ones . these concern the self - consistent solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for a repulsive 1d hubbard hamiltonian written in the hartree - fock approximation at zero- and at a finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> using methods of the finite band potential theory @xcite , the coupled solitonic charge- and spin superstructures are described analytically in terms of the jakobi elliptic functions , which , in turn , represent solutions of the non - linear schrdinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that far enough from half filling of the bare single electron band the solitonic superstructures smoothly evolve into two coupled cdw and sdw harmonics , considered in the first two parts of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of the effective mode coupling constant accompanies this transition . </S>"
