    "the beijing electron  positron collider ( bepc ) was constructed for both high energy physics and synchrotron radiation ( sr ) research . as a unique @xmath2 collider operating in the @xmath3-charm region and the first sr source in china ,",
    "the machine has been operated for well over 16 years since it was put into operation in 1989 .",
    "bepcii is an upgrade project from bepc .",
    "it is a double ring machine . following the success of kekb , the crossing scheme was adopted in bepcii , where two beams collide with a horizontal crossing angle of @xmath4  mrad .",
    "the design luminosity of bepcii is @xmath5 at @xmath6gev , which is about @xmath7 times higher than bepc  @xcite .",

    "the first electron beam was stored in the sr ring in november 2006 .",
    "optics measurement and correction was studied at that time .",
    "the backup collision mode was first tuned in the spring of 2007 , during the course of which we learned the collision tuning .",
    "the superconducting final focus magnet was installed in the summer of 2007 .",
    "the detector was installed in june 2008 , and this completed the construction of the machine . here , we review the machine tuning history in chronological order .      the big events in this period are listed below .",

    "profile monitor , which caused very strong longitudinal multibunch instability , was removed from the positron ring . *",

    "the longitudinal coupled bunch instability still reduced the luminosity performance even after the removal of the profile monitor , which caused very strong instability , from the positron ring . in order to increase the luminosity with the same beam current , we tried to move the horizontal tune closer to @xmath11 in may 2009 .",
    "the peak luminosity increased from 2 to @xmath12 .",
    "since the detector background is too high to take data with @xmath13 , the machine continued to run with @xmath14 in the following normal data collection run . in the first half of 2010 , the longitudinal feedback system began to work and",
    "the peak luminosity achieved @xmath12 with @xmath14 .",
    "the maximum @xmath15 is about 0.02 when @xmath14 , which is less than the simulated 30% percent ( see table  [ tab : coupling ] ) .",

    "it was found that the final focus magnet and vacuum chamber on one side of the detector was displaced by about 10  mm in the horizontal direction .",
    "it was aligned in the summer shutdown . *",
    "december 2010 .",
    "detector background was reduced with @xmath16 .",
    "the physics people could take data near the 0.51 working point .",
    "the most important advance in this period is the reduction of the detector background with @xmath17 , since the physics people could take data at the working point and the accelerator people had enough time to do the luminosity tuning .",
    "the detector background is mainly optimized by the closed orbit tuning along the ring .",
    "figure  [ fig : peaklum-2011 ] shows the peak luminosity record from the beginning of 2010 to the summer of 2011 .",
    "it was very exciting near the start of 2011 since a new record would be born only in a few days .",
    "the peak luminosity was @xmath18 in 2011 .",
    "the comparison of luminosity at different working points is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum - comp - tune ] , which very obviously shows that a working point closer to @xmath11 means a higher luminosity .",
    "the 20102011 commissioning year was very successful and exciting , but there was some confusion when we saw the beam  beam performance .",
    "the achieved @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xiy-2011 ] .",
    "there exist clear saturation phenomenon for @xmath15 and the maximum is about 0.033 .",
    "we should explain what caused the saturation .",
    "figure  [ fig : xiy - lengthing-2011 ] shows the bunch lengthening effect .",
    "it seems this effect does not bring very much luminosity loss , and the maximum beam  beam parameter is still above 0.04 .",
    "the nonlinear arc may also reduce the luminosity performance .",
    "we use hirata s bbc  @xcite code as a pass method in accelerator toolbox ( at )  @xcite to simulate the weak  strong beam  beam interaction .",
    "the map in the arc is implemented using the element - by - element symplectic tracking in at .",
    "figure  [ fig : xiy - arc ] shows the comparison between the ideal transfer matrix map and element - by - element tracking in arc .",
    "the lattice really reduces the beam  beam performance , but we did not believe that the saturation was mainly caused by the crosstalk between nonlinear arc and beam  beam force . on the other hand , we could not ignore the simulation result , which told us that we should put more emphasis on the sexupole optimization .",
    "there is another crossing point ( ncp ) in the north of the two rings , where the colliding beams are separated vertically by about 8  mm and the full horizontal angle is about @xmath19  rad ( 17.7@xmath20 ) .",
    "we still use the weak  strong code ( at and bbc ) to study the parasitic beam  beam effect , which is shown in fig .",

    "the horizontal separation between colliding bunches is greater than @xmath21 .    after the hardware modification , the beam  beam performance did not increase as expected , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xiy-2012 ] .",
    "this could be explained to some extent by the large longitudinal offset of the collision point . in 20112012 commissioning year , the offset is about 3  mm , and it is about 6  mm in february 2012 .",
    "we did not put enough emphasis on monitoring the parameter during collision at that time .",
    "the big events in this period are listed below .",
    "* lower @xmath0 mode was first tested at 2.18  gev in february 2013 .",
    "the @xmath15 record 0.033 was broken after about two years .",
    "* one bunch every three buckets , and even one bunch every two buckets , injection was tested in the machine study of march 2013 .",

    "the momentum compaction factor of the new lattice is about 0.017 , and the old one is 0.024 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath0 is achieved by increasing the horizontal tune from 6.5 to 7.5 . during the lattice design",
    ", we also optimized the chromatic distortion and some nonlinear resonance driving terms .",
    "however we still did not establish a so - called ` standard ' that could tell us if the lattice is good enough .",
    "the achieved beam  beam performance at 2.18  gev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xiy - alphap-2.18 ]",
    ". we also did some machine study in order to increase the peak luminosity at 1.89  gev .",

    "[ fig : xiy - md189 - 2013 ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath15 is above 0.04 .",
    "it seems that the multibunch effect reduces the beam  beam performance , which would be a serious limitation if we were to continue to increase the luminosity .",
    "we review the collision optimization history of bepcii .",
    "the suppression of multibunch longitudinal instability and moving the horizontal tune close to @xmath11 helped us to increase the luminosity .",
    "the mitigation of long range beam ",
    "beam interaction seems not so effective as expected , indicating that maybe the real vertical separation is greater than estimated .",
    "the lower @xmath0 lattice helped us to achieve the @xmath15 record of 0.04 at 1.89  gev .",
    "the simulation study is very important both in the design and the daily commissioning .",
    "it gives a benchmark in normal operation and lets us know if the status is optimized enough , even though we could approach the simulation result and never go beyond it .",
    "the difference between the simulation and the optimized result is about 1020% .",
    "it should also be emphasized that we would like to use the maximum achieved @xmath15 in the simulation as the beam  beam limit in the simulation .",
    "increasing beam current is a must to increasing the luminosity .",
    "however , it seems the multibunch effect is very serious . the study to cure the instability and",
    "even find the instability source will be very important in the future . in the near future , we ll test a new lattice with @xmath23 about 0.017 , larger emittance ( 100  nm@xmath24130  nm ) and lower @xmath25 ( 1.5  cm@xmath241.35  cm ) .",
    "the colliding bunch current could be higher with the new mode and the beam current could be higher with same bunch number .",
    "it is expected that this could help us to increase the luminosity ."
