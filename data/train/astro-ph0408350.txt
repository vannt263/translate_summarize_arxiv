    "recently , ghirlanda , ghisellini and lazzati ( 2004 , ggl04 thereafter ) found a surprisingly tight correlation between the peak of the @xmath7ray spectrum @xmath8 ( in a @xmath9 plot ) and the collimation corrected energy emitted in @xmath7rays @xmath10 in long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the latter is related to the isotropically equivalent energy @xmath11 by the value of the jet aperture angle @xmath12 , by @xmath13 .",
    "the scatter around this correlation is tight enough to wonder if the correlation itself can be used for a reliable estimate of @xmath11 , making grbs distance indicators , and therefore probes for the determination of the cosmological ,  parameters , and for the exploration of the matter to vacuum dominance transition .",
    "this issue is similar to the case of sn ia : they are not perfect standard candles ( i.e. their luminosities are not all the same ) , nevertheless the luminosity of a specific supernova can be found through the correlation of their luminosity and the speed of the decay of their light curve ( i.e. the slower the brighter , phillips 1993 ; riess , press & kirshner 1995 ) .",
    "it is the existence of this correlation among sn ia which made possible their cosmological use ( riess et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter r04 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ) .    very recently",
    ", this problem has been explored by dai , liang & xu ( 2004 ) , which found tight constraints on  and  using the correlation found by ggl04 .",
    "their result is however based on a strong assumption : they assume as universal the correlation measured in a particular cosmology ( without errors on its slope ) , and use it to derive the cosmology itself .",
    "actually , the best fit correlation depends on the cosmology adopted to derive burst luminosities and the correlation should be re  calibrated for each cosmology .    in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that a correct approach leads to less tight constraints on the cosmological parameters using grbs alone . on the other hand",
    ", a more interesting cosmological result can be acheived if a combined fit with sn ia is performed .",
    "as in the case of sn ia , the use of a class of objects as cosmological `` rulers '' requires them being standard candles . the luminosity of grbs , calculated assuming isotropy , spans @xmath14 orders of magnitude ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) , but strong observational evidence ( i.e. the achromatic break in the afterglow light  curve ) indicates that the burst emission is collimated into a cone / jet of some aperture angle @xmath12 ( levinson & eichler 1993 ; rhoads 1997 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ; fruchter et al .",
    "the corresponding energy emitted in @xmath7rays , corrected by the collimation factor @xmath15 , clusters around @xmath16 erg , with a small dispersion ( 0.5 dex ) , yet not small enough for a cosmological use ( bloom et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "ggl04 found a tight correlation between @xmath10 and the ( rest frame ) peak energy @xmath8 of the @xmath9 prompt emission spectrum : @xmath17 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath18 depends on the assumed cosmology .",
    "using @xmath19 and @xmath20 we have @xmath21 the scatter of the data points around the correlation is of the order of 0.1 dex .",
    "this allows to reconstruct the value of @xmath10 by measuring @xmath8 .",
    "this is analogous to sn ia , for which there is a tight relation between their peak luminosity and the stretching factor of their optical light curve ( phillips 1993 ; goldhaber et al .",
    "2001 ) , with less luminous supernovae showing a faster post  maximum light curve decay ( reiss et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the proper modelling of this effect ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) improves the determination of the sn ia luminosity and consequently reduces the scatter in the hubble diagram , yielding constraints on the cosmological parameters ( see r04 using sn ia with redshift up to @xmath11.75 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 correlation for grbs makes them a new class of `` rulers '' for observational cosmology and combining grbs and sn ia can further reduce the region of allowed values in the cosmological parameter space .",
    "furthermore , since grbs are detectable at larger @xmath23 , they are a powerful tool to explore in more detail the cosmic kinematics .    the difference between the standard candle assumption and the use of the intrinsic correlations , for both grbs and sn ia , is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( top and bottom panel , respectively ) through the hubble diagram in the form of luminosity  distance vs redshift . in the upper panel",
    "we assume that grbs and sn ia are standard candles with a unique energy ( @xmath24 erg ) for grbs and luminosity ( @xmath25=-21.1 ) for sn .",
    "the derivation of the luminosity distance @xmath26 for sn follows straightforwardly from their distance modulus ( r04 ) .",
    "for grbs we have @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the @xmath7ray fluence ( i.e. the time integrated @xmath7ray flux ) .",
    "note that the determination of @xmath12 requires the knowledge of the isotropic energy ( see e.g. eq . 1 in frail et al .",
    "2001 ) , in turn requiring specific values of ( , ) . in the bottom panel",
    "we plot sn ia and grbs after correcting for the stretching ",
    "luminosity and the @xmath29@xmath8 relations , respectively . in this case",
    "the isotropic energy @xmath11 of grbs has been estimated from their measured @xmath8 through the @xmath10@xmath8 correlation and the error on the slope of this correlation has been properly included in the @xmath26 total uncertainty .",
    "also in this case we must fix a given ( , ) cosmology both for the derivation of @xmath12 and for finding the best @xmath29@xmath8 relation .",
    "as in the sn ia case , the luminosity distance of grbs derived from their @xmath10@xmath8 correlation ( bottom panel ) highly reduces the scatter around possible different cosmologies ( solid , dashed and dotted lines ) .",
    "moreover , grbs populate the @xmath30 region , where @xmath31 is rather sensitive on ( , ) .",
    "the correlation found by ggl04 _ assumes _ = 0.3 and = 0.7 , and @xmath32 .",
    "changes on  and  induce a change on the normalization and slope of eq .",
    "[ corr ] , together with a _ different scatter _ of the data points around the best fit line .",
    "we can then ask what is the pair of cosmological values ,  which produces the `` minimum scatter '' around the fit , performed using the very same ,  pair . to this aim",
    "we use all the 15 bursts of known redshifts , @xmath8 and jet break time @xmath33 listed in tab . 1 and tab . 2 of ggl04 .    the difference with the study of dai",
    ", liang & xu ( 2004 ) lies mainly in this point : they assumed that the @xmath10-@xmath8 correlation is exact and cosmology independent , while it is not .",
    "erg ( i.e. a @xmath02.6% and @xmath016% change in slope and normalization with respect to eq .",
    "1 ) . with = 1 , = 1 we obtain @xmath34 erg ( i.e. a @xmath09% and @xmath030% change in slope and normalization with respect to eq .",
    "additional differences concern : i ) the estimate of the errors on the density of the interstellar medium when it is unknown",
    "( they assume @xmath35 @xmath36 while we allow @xmath37 to cover the entire 110 @xmath36 range ) ; ii ) we do not exclude grb 990510 and grb 030226 from the analysis ; iii ) we include grb 030429 , for which a jet break time was recently found by jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; iv ) we always use @xmath15 ( instead of the @xmath38 approximation ) as the collimation correction factor ( also when estimating the error on @xmath10 ) .",
    "we also consider the 156 sn ia of the `` gold '' sample of r04 , finding the corresponding ,  contours using the distance moduli and corresponding errors listed in their tab .",
    "2 shows our results .",
    "grbs alone ( red lines ) are almost insensitive to  but limit  to lie within @xmath00.05 and 0.22 ( 68% confidence level ) .",
    "we also show the region pinpointed by the wmap experiment ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is only marginally consistent with the allowed region from sn ia alone ( blue lines in fig .",
    "2 ) . the combined grbs+sn ia fit ( filled regions in fig . 2 ) selects a region which is more consistent with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results .",
    "the minimum ( with a reduced @xmath39=1.146 ) is for = 0.37@xmath40 and = 0.87@xmath41 ( 1@xmath42 ) . assuming a flat universe yields = 0.29@xmath43 and = 0.71@xmath44 .",
    "if we use the  classical \" hubble diagram method , we compare the @xmath26 values given by estimating @xmath10 through the actual correlation found in each point of the ,  plane with the luminosity distance calculated through e.g. eq .",
    "11 of r04 ( see also carrol et al . 1992 ) .",
    "then , by a @xmath45 statistics , we find the confidence regions in the ,  plane , which are plotted as dashed line on fig .",
    "this classical method is very similar to the previous one , since it uses the same available information .",
    "the small difference ( contours slightly larger ) is due to the fact that with the  minimum scatter \" method we calculate the distance of the data points from the correlation ( i.e. perpendicular to the fitting line ) , while , using the  classical \" hubble diagram method , we are using the distance between the @xmath10 data point and the corresponding @xmath10 by the correlation",
    ".    we can further constrain , with the combined grb and sn samples , the dark energy component which is parametrized by its equation of state @xmath46 . furthermore , @xmath47 could be varying , and one possible parametrization is @xmath48 ( see e.g. r04 ) . adopting this law",
    ", we compute the luminosity distance according to eq .",
    "14 of r04 , assuming a flat cosmology with = 0.27 . in this case",
    "the fit is performed in the @xmath49@xmath50 plane for grbs , sn and for the combined samples .",
    "as before , we recompute the @xmath10@xmath8 relation for each @xmath51 , @xmath50 pair . , @xmath50 , consider that , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the correlation becomes @xmath54 erg ( i.e. a @xmath03.4% and @xmath015% change in slope and normalization with respect to eq .",
    "1 ) . ] fig .",
    "3 reports the corresponding confidence intervals . besides making the confidence region smaller than what derived for sn alone ,",
    "the effect of grbs is to include within the 68% contour of the joint sn+grb sample ( filled region ) the @xmath55 , @xmath56 point , corresponding to the classical cosmological constant .",
    "grbs can now be used as cosmological  rulers \" , bridging the gap between the relatively nearby type ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background . the swift satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) , designed for the fast localization of grbs , is expected to find about one hundred of grbs per year : it can open up a new era for the accurate measurements of the geometry and kinematics of our universe ( for a more extended discussion see firmani et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we stress that , besides finding high redshift bursts , which are of course very important for finding tighter constraints , it is crucial to find _ low redshift _",
    "grbs , to determine the @xmath10@xmath8 correlation in a redshift range which is not affected by the ,  values .",
    "this would allow to use the resulting correlation unchanged for all values of , , strongly reducing the associated errors . in turns , this will allow to constrain cosmological parameters independently from sn ia .",
    "this is important since grbs are unaffected by dust extinction and it is very unlikely that two completely different classes of objects would have similar evolutions to mimic a consistent set of cosmological parameters .    in fig .",
    "4 we show an illustrative example of what can be done _ if a given correlation were known to be valid independently of the cosmological parameters_. for this we have chosen the correlation given by eq .",
    "it can be seen that even the limited sample of our bursts can strongly influence the grb+sn confidence contours , making them more in agreement with the wmap results ( not unexpectedly , since we have used just the correlation appropriate for = 0.3 and = 0.7 . a similar consideration concerns",
    "the dai et al .",
    "2004 result ) .",
    "we would like to stress that in order to use grbs to find the cosmological parameters , we need a set of well measured data , and especially a well measured jet break time @xmath33 , necessary to find the collimation angle @xmath12 , and a good spectral determination of the prompt emission .",
