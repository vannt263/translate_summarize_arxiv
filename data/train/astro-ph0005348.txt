    "pre - main sequence ( pms ) late - type stars are known to be x - ray sources ( see walter et al .",
    "1988 , bouvier 1990 and neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the evolution of these stars to the main sequence ( ms ) , there is a state usually defined as post - t tauri stars ( ptts ) .",
    "ptts were first defined by herbig ( 1978 ) as pms stars more evolved than classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) but still contracting to the ms .",
    "given that the stage of ctts is only a small fraction of the total time of contraction of low - mass stars to the ms , ptts should be much more abundant than ctts if star formation has been ongoing for a sufficiently long time . however , it is difficult to find ptts because they do not show spectroscopic or photometric peculiarities which make them easy to detect .",
    "unlike ctts , they do not present significant ir or uv excesses and the h@xmath1 line is not observed as a strong emission line . therefore , the identification of these stars is difficult and relies on the detection of the li i ( 6708 ) absorption line and the chromospheric ca ii ( h & k ) lines in their spectra , as well as on their x - ray detection .",
    "murphy ( 1969 ) first proposed that ptts could be searched as members of young binary systems .",
    "the basis of his idea was that the ms lifetime of high - mass stars is comparable to the contraction timescale of solar - type stars .",
    "hence , there could be binary systems comprised of ms early - type stars physically bound to ptts .",
    "gahm et al .",
    "( 1983 ) carried out photometric and spectroscopic observations of visual double stars with early type primaries .",
    "the derived data , together with @xmath2 observations , allowed lindroos ( 1986 ; l86 hereafter ) to identify 78 likely physical pairs with several ptts candidates as secondaries .",
    "a high lithium abundance and a high chromospheric activity level are necessary ( although not sufficient ) indicators of youth .",
    "martn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and pallavicini et al .",
    "( 1992 ) carried out optical spectroscopy of the lindroos late - type companions , detecting the li i(6708 ) absorption line and the ca ii ( h & k ) emission lines in the spectra of several ptts candidates .",
    "ray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) took this sample of `` genuine '' ptts and looked for circumstellar matter around them .",
    "for this purpose , they analyzed the iras database ( point source catalogue and faint source catalogue ) and also searched for continuum 1.1 mm emission .",
    "while ir excesses were found for most of the sources , no mm dust continuum was detected ( see also gahm et al . 1994 and jewitt 1994 ) .",

    "the source is very close to the support structure of the telescope , so we are not sure about the reliability of the upper limit ; 2 .",
    "this source has two pspc observations : 201271p and 201271p-1 .",
    "there are no detections in the individual observations , so we have added up both files to improve the s / n ratio .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) was performed with the pspc .",
    "the diameter of the field of view is 2   and each object is observed up to @xmath20 times separated by @xmath21 minutes , with up to @xmath22 30 sec per scan .",
    "the spectral resolution of the pspc ( 43% at 0.93 kev ) allows spectral analysis in three energy bands : + - _ soft _ = 0.1 to 0.4 kev + - _ hard 1 _ = 0.5 to 0.9 kev + - _ hard 2 _ = 0.9 to 2.0 kev + while in some pointed observations the signal to noise are large enough to carry out detailed spectral analysis , this is not possible for rass data .",
    "note that the rass exposure times of our sample range from 75 sec to 1236 sec .",
    "however , we can obtain spectral information of our sources studying the x - ray hardness ratios ( hr ) defined as follows : + @xmath23 where h1 and h2 are the counts observed in the hard 1 and hard 2 bands , and s are the counts observed in the soft band .",
    "hence , hr values can range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . if no counts are detected in one of the bands only an upper or lower limit to hr1 and hr2",
    "is available .",
    "neither hr values nor limits are available for undetected stars .",
    "the nominal positional accuracy of the rosat pspc detector in pointing mode is @xmath22 25  at 1 kev ( note that it is energy and off - axis angle dependent ) .",
    "however , this accuracy is reduced to @xmath22 1  in the survey phase .",
    "if the offset between the x - ray source and the optical position exceeds the spatial resolution of the rass data ( @xmath22 1 ) , the identification of the x - ray source with the optical counterpart is doubtful .",
    "hence , for all the rass observations we have to select a maximal displacement between the x - ray and the optical position within which the detections are reliable .",
    "following neuhuser et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we have taken a value of 40   as the maximal distance between the x - ray detection and the optical counterpart .",
    "the rass data ( detections and upper limits ) of our sample are shown in table 2 .",
    "the name of the source and the position of the x - ray detection are given in columns 1 and 2 .",
    "as mentioned before , the spatial resolution of the pspc is too low to resolve most of the binary systems .",
    "in fact , in most of the cases we have only obtained a single detection displaced from both components of the system .",
    "hence , we show in column 3 the displacements of the x - ray detection with respect to the optical positions of both members of the binary system .",
    "there is only one system in which the projected separation is so large that the x - ray emission can be clearly attributed to the secondary star : hd87901 . the total number of counts in the broad band , the exposure time and the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 are given in columns 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . in the case of non - detections we have computed the number of counts at the position of both components , a and b , respectively .",
    "an estimate of the probability of the detection by the ml procedure is given in the last column ; a value of ml=5 corresponds to a 2.7@xmath26 signal over the background .",
    "note that 11 sources listed in table 1 do not appear in table 2 .",
    "most of them ( hd8803 , hd27638 , hd36013 , hd36779 , hd53755 , hd71510 , hd123445 and hd162082 ) are not detected and are located so close to another x - ray sources that a computation of an upper limit is not possible .",
    "two of them ( hd70309 , hd76566 and hd120641 ) show bad quality exposure maps so no x - ray data can be derived .",
    "the same information as in table 2 is given in table 3 for pspc pointed observations .",
    "only four of our binary systems were observed in pspc pointings , with just two of them detected .",
    "columns 1 and 2 provide the name of the system and the rosat observation request ( ror ) number .",
    "the coordinates of the x - ray detection are given in column 3 .",
    "as in the case of the rass data , the spatial resolution is not high enough to detect both components of the binary systems . as a consequence , we show the displacement @xmath16 of the x - ray source with respect to both components of the binary system in column 4 .",

    "our primary stars are bright sources in the uv range so , in principle , the computed s - band rate could be just a response of the detector to the uv light . in order to check the reliability of the s - band counts for the early - type stars , we have estimated the contribution of the photospheric uv light to the total s - band rate .",

    "the bolometric luminosities have been computed using the stellar data provided in table 1 and the bolometric corrections from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) .",
    "as we can see from table 6 , most of the b - type stars of our sample have s - band rates significantly higher than the estimated uv - rates .",
    "there is only one source for which both values are comparable : hd87901a .",

    "( 1 ) is not reliable for these cases .",
    "however , this system was resolved by the pspc in the rass survey ( see tab .",
    "2 ) and , as we mentioned in sect .",
    "3 , no emission was detected from the early - type star but from the secondary .    to further test the reliability of the s - band emission in early - type stars , we have also studied the @xmath36 ratio of these stars to see if it is consistent with the ratio for stars of similar spectral types . according to table 6 ,",
    "most of the stars show ratios consistent with the reported values for early - type stars ( berghfer et al .",
    "there are also four stars with unusual ratios : hd87901 with a lower ratio , and hd123445 , hd127971 and hd129791 , with ratios closer to those found in late - type stars .",
    "given that these three early - type stars also show positive hr , it is possible that they have unresolved late - type companions .",
    "however , in the case of hd87901 the hr is negative and the @xmath36 is lower than in late - type stars , so the x - ray emission can not be related with an unresolved source .",
    "this fact together with its non - detection in the rass make us think that this emission is due to the hri uv leak .",
    "therefore , excluding hd87901a , we can identify the computed s - band rates with intrinsic x - ray emission from the sources .",
    "the previous test allows to confirm the reliability of the computed hri hr s .",
    "given that these hr s are systematically positive for late - type stars and systematically negative for early - type stars , we can conclude that the nature of the x - ray emission is intrinsically different for our two samples .",
    "we will discuss this point more deeply in the following subsection .",
    "the analysis of the hr s suggests that the nature of the x - ray emission is different for our two samples .",
    "a useful way to represent this difference consists of comparing the x - ray luminosities obtained in the two hri bands , s and h , for all of our detected sources .",
    "3 shows this comparison .",
    "note that we have converted the s- and h - band rates into luminosities following the procedure described in sect .",
    "we have not included hd33802 because the binary is not completely resolved and it is difficult to obtain reliable measurements from the individual members ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , there is a clear separation between early- and late - type stars .",
    "early - type stars are generally softer than the late - type companions .",
    "this result is in agreement with that obtained from the hr s analysis .",
    "note that although most of the early - type stars lie below the 1:1 correlation line , there are three early - type primaries with higher x - ray luminosities in the h - band than in the s - band : hd123445a , hd127971a and hd129791a . as we explained before",
    ", the higher h - band luminosities obtained for the later - type stars are in agreement with their condition of active stars ( note that all are located above or on the 1:1 correlation line ) .",
    "in contrast , the higher h - band luminosities for the early type stars are not easy to explain , given that these stars are not supposed to have a convective zone able to support a corona . because these stars lie in the same part of the diagram as the late - type secondaries , the simplest explanation is to relate them to unresolved late - type companions .    after the analysis of the x - ray luminosities in the two bands , we have studied the total x - ray luminosities of the whole sample . given that the x - ray emission typically assumes a particular value for each spectral type , we have plotted the x - ray luminosity against the bolometric luminosity for each star .",
    "the bolometric corrections were adopted from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) . only in the case of the m - type star , hd109573b ( hr4796b ) ,",
    "the bolometric correction was taken from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , there is a clear separation between late- and early - type stars .",
    "late - type stars lie in the region of @xmath37 with x - ray luminosities varying between @xmath3827.5 and 31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the early - type primaries show lower x - ray luminosities that decrease from b1 to a0 spectral types . however , the three late - b type stars which clearly deviate in fig . 3 also deviate in this figure , showing a higher x - ray emission than expected for their spectral types : b9 , b7 and b9.5 .",
    "we have compared these results with those previously obtained by schmitt et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosities derived for their sample of 7 lindroos systems agree with our results except in one case : hd113703 .",
    "while these authors identify the single hri x - ray detection with the early - type primary , we think it is most probably related to the late - type secondary . as we discussed in sect .",
    "3 , the difference between the x - ray detection and the optical position is smaller for the late - type secondary in both the broad and hard band images .    at this point we must also remark that the young star hd109573b ( hr4796b ) shows an x - ray luminosity higher than that reported by jura et al .",
    "these authors compute the x - ray luminosity from the same hri image but using an ecf that corresponds to the pspc detector , although these detectors have different sensitivities .",
    "moreover , they take a mean ecf from neuhuser et al . ( 1995 ) which is deduced from a rosat survey on taurus , a star forming region where most of the stars show visual extinctions larger than those in twa . therefore , we think that the value listed in table 5 is more realistic since it takes into account the ecf from the hri detector and a negligible absorption to the source .",
    "one of our binary systems , hd560 , was detected but unresolved by the rosat hri ( see fig .",
    "because this system is comprised of a b9 primary and a g5 type companion , we have made a simple test to confirm the results obtained for hd123445a , hd127971a and hd129791a : although we certainly know that hd560 is a binary system , we have supposed hd560 to be a single b9 star and not a pair .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the single x - ray detection corresponds to a b9-type star and we plot this source into fig .",
    "4 ( starred symbol ) , the result is that hd560 lies in the same part of the diagram as the three sources with unresolved late - type candidates .",
    "hence , this test strengthens the idea of unresolved late - type companions in these late - b type stars .",
    "we have compared our sample of primary stars with a sample of ms b - stars taken from the _ the rass catalogue of optically bright ob - type stars _ ( berghfer et al . , 1996 ) in figure 4 . in principle , our primary stars are in good agreement with the sample of b - type stars with comparable x - ray luminosities .",

    "its x - ray emission is not as large as this coming from the other three sources above the ic2602 li i envelope .",
    "the different spectral type as well as the different evolutionary state could explain this difference .",
    "6a also allows us to confirm the nature of the hd123445 and hd127971 pairs .",
    "the secondary stars lie at the bottom of the diagram with upper limits in both , the li i ew and the x - ray emission .",
    "two more stars show non - detections in x - rays although they lie very close to the upper envelope of the pleiades : hd27638 and hd40494 . as we have discussed above , the former",
    "is probably bound to the primary ( see table 7 ) while the nature of the later one is not still clear .    as a conclusion , we can say that those stars with strong x - ray emission seem to be younger than ic2602 .",
    "note , however that although the uncertainties associated with the li i ew measurements are generally low ( see table 7 ) , for the stars earlier than @xmath22k0 the li i ew does not allow us to reach any conclusion about their ages because f- and g - type pms together with zams stars still have their initial li content .    to study the last issue in detail , we have converted the li i ew into lithium abundances , n(li ) making use of non - lte curves of growth from pavlenko & magazz ( 1996 ) and assuming a surface gravity of @xmath56 . note that we have only considered high - resolution data to make this conversion ( see table 7 ) .",

    "late - type stars always show positive hr while most of the early - type stars show negative values . moreover ,",
    "if we compare the x - ray luminosity in the two energy bands of the hri , we can see that there is a clear separation between the two samples .",
    "late - type stars show higher h - band than s - band x - ray luminosities .",
    "this result can be explained in terms of an energetic corona and activity episodes commonly reported in these stars . in the case of early - type stars ,",
    "most of them present higher s - band than h - band luminosities . however , there are three x - ray sources formally identified as early - type primaries which show h - band luminosities comparable to those of late - type stars : hd123445a , hd127971a and hd129791a .",
    "the @xmath57 diagram shows a clear separation among sources of different spectral types .",
    "this separation is even more prononced when the @xmath58 ratio is plotted vs. the hri hardness ratio .",
    "while early - type stars , which generally show negative hr s , lie close to the @xmath59 `` canonical '' relation , late - type stars show positive hr s and present higher values of this ratio ( @xmath60 ) .    for those particular cases of early - type stars with positive hr s",
