    "we conduct a series of experiments with a special interest on a penetration process and instabilities arisen on a liquid jet impinged to a liquid of the same kind flowing in a channel .",
    "the impinged jet penetrates into the flowing bath accompanying with entrainment of the ambient immiscible gas , which results in the impinged jet wrapped by the entrained gas as a sheath. this sheath formation enables the impinged jet to survive in the fluid in the channel without coalescing until the entrained - air sheath breaks down .",
    "occasionally a cap of the entrained air is formed at the tip of the penetrated jet , and the jet elongates like a long balloon ."
