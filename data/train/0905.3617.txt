    "the interest in the study of magnetism in nanoparticles has been renewed from the last few decades due to their technological @xcite as well as fundamental research aspects .",
    "@xcite the magnetic properties of nanoparticles are dominated by finite - size effects , and the surface anomalies such as surface anisotropy and roughness .",
    "@xcite as the particle size decreases , the fraction of the spins lying on the surface of a nanoparticle increases , thus , making the surface play an important role .",
    "the reduced coordination of the surface spins causes a symmetry lowering locally , and leads to a surface anisotropy , that starts dominating as the particle size decreases .",
    "the dynamics of an assembly of nanoparticles at low temperatures gained a lot of attention over the last few years . in a dilute system of nanoparticles ,",
    "the interparticle interaction is very small as compared to the anisotropy energy of the individual particle .",
    "these isolated particles follow the dynamics in accordance with nel - brown model @xcite and the system is known as superparamagnetic .",
    "the giant spin moment of nanoparticles thermally fluctuates between their easy directions at high temperatures .",
    "as the temperature is lowered towards a blocking temperature , the relaxation time becomes equal to the measuring time and the super spin moments freeze along one of their easy directions . as the role of interparticle interaction becomes significant , nanoparticles do not behave like individual particles , rather their dynamics is governed by the collective behavior of the particles , like in a spin glass .",
    "@xcite this super spin - glass phase has been characterized by observations of a critical slowing down , @xcite a divergence in the nonlinear susceptibility , @xcite and aging and relaxation effects in the low - frequency ac susceptibility .",
    "@xcite the monte carlo simulations on the system of assembly of nanoparticles show aging @xcite and magnetic relaxation behavior @xcite like in a spin glass , but simulations of zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) susceptibilities show no indication of spin - glass ordering .",
    "@xcite the aging and memory effects are the two aspects that have been studied extensively in recent years , however mostly for the case of ferromagnetic particles .",
    "@xcite in this paper our aim is to investigate these effects for collection of a few antiferromagnetic nanoparticles ( afns ) which has received relatively lesser attention .",
    "nel predicted @xcite that afns exhibit weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism behavior , which is attributed to a net magnetic moment due to incomplete magnetic compensation between the atoms in two sublattices .",
    "these sublattices are identical in every respect , except that the atomic moments in one sublattice are antiparallel to that in other . for nickel oxide ( nio ) nanoparticles , the magnetic moment @xmath0 predicted by nel s model varies as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of spins . @xcite weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism were later confirmed by experiments @xcite on fine particles and extremely fine particles of nio , respectively .",
    "mishra and subrahmanayam @xcite have also concluded a net magnetic moment in nio afn due to finite size effect in nel - state ordering , which is showing a non - monotonic and oscillatory dependence on particle size @xmath3 .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations were found to be varying linearly with @xmath3 , consistent with nel s model .",
    "however , the value of net magnetic moment due to finite size effect in nel - state ordering does not quantify the large magnetic moment experimentally observed in nio nanoparticles .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the ignorance of different ordering of surface spins than the core spins in these studies .",
    "monte carlo simulations on antiferromagnetic particles highlighted the dominant role of surface spins in net magnetization of the nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite the surface effects have been considered to be the major cause for the large magnetic moment in the nio nanoparticle .",
    "@xcite the breakdown of the dominant next - nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction on the surface of the nanoparticle leads to uncompensated spins .",
    "these uncompensated spins play a vital role in determining the magnetic behavior of nio nanoparticles .",
    "thus , an enhancement of surface and interface effects make the afns an interesting area of research .",
    "@xcite    recently , mishra and subrahmanyam @xcite have shown that for nio nanoparticles the net magnetic moment , a combined effect of surface roughness effect and finite - size effects in core magnetization , exhibits size dependent fluctuations in net magnetic moment . these size dependent fluctuations in magnetization lead",
    "to a dynamics which is qualitatively different from ferromagnetic nanoparticles .    in this paper , we mainly focus on the dynamics of collection of a few noninteracting nio nanoparticles using master equation approach .",
    "we examine the effect of the size - dependent magnetization fluctuations on the time - dependent properties of sparse assembly of the nanoparticles .",
    "we will compare the zfc and fc magnetizations of antiferromagnetic particles with the ferromagnetic case .",
    "we will consider the effect of polydispersity as well .",
    "we will perform a series of heating / cooling processes which were earlier discussed in the case of ferromagnetic nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite we will also discuss the memory effects and aging effects throughly .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ mod1 ]",
    "we discuss the model .",
    "the zfc and fc magnetizations for various distributions are discussed in section [ seczfc ] and in section [ secmemory ] we show the memory effects investigations .",
    "aging effects has been presented in section [ secaging ] .",
    "finally we summarize in sec [ secconclusion ] .",
    "the inset displays the magnetic moment vs particle size .",
    "magnetic moment has a non - monotonic and oscillatory dependence on @xmath3 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    in an earlier study , @xcite we have shown that the total magnetic moment of nio antiferromagnetic nanoparticle displays size dependent fluctuations as shown in the inset of figure [ fig1a ] .",
    "the net magnetic moment shows a trend where magnetic moment is very small for smallest size particles . increasing the size ,",
    "magnetic moment increases and reaches a maximum at @xmath4 , and again decreases towards the bulk value . on the other hand ,",
    "the net magnetic moment of ferromagnetic nanoparticles @xcite shows a linear dependence on the size of the particles hence one might expect the role of these size - dependent fluctuations in magnetization should be manifested in the time dependent properties of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles .    in our simple model",
    ", the energy of each particle @xmath5 is contributed by anisotropy energy ( either due to the shape or the crystalline structure of the particle ) , and zeeman energy . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the direction of field is same as that of anisotropy axes .",
    "thus @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the anisotropy constant and @xmath8 is the applied magnetic field . in the absence of field , the superparamagnetic relaxation time for the thermal activation over the energy barrier @xmath9",
    "is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , the microscopic time is of the order of @xmath12 sec and @xmath13 is boltzmann constant .",
    "the anisotropy constant @xmath7 has a typical value @xcite about @xmath14 j@xmath15 .",
    "the occupation probabilities with the magnetic moment parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field direction are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "these probabilities must satisfy the master equation@xcite",
    "@xmath18    where the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rate of transition of the magnetic moment from the two states at time @xmath21 , given as @xmath22 \\left [   1-{\\mu}_i h(t)/t(t)\\right ]   $ ] and @xmath22 \\left [   1+{\\mu}_i h(t)/t(t)\\right ] $ ] respectively . using the values of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , eq",

    "thus the total magnetic moment of the system of nanoparticles with volume distribution @xmath29 is given by @xmath30    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we can also shed some light on the role of polydispersity on memory effect .",
    "we compare the relative strength of memory effect in these distributions by introducing a parameter , memory fraction i.e. , the ratio of @xmath31 at the stop during memory measurement , where @xmath32 . in all the cases , we fix the waiting time at stop to be @xmath33 .",
    "the calculated values of the memory fraction for antiferromagnetic case is @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . for ferromagnetic case",
    "the memory fraction takes values @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "an interesting observation in the case of antiferromagnetic nanoparticle is the higher value of memory fraction for _ dist.b _ than that for _ dist.a _ and _ dist.c_. as we know that the finite - size and surface roughness effects are responsible for the enhancement of net magnetization for the intermediate size ranges _",
    "dist.b _ , the net memory dip is more in this case .",
    "however , for ferromagnetic nanoparticles , where the net magnetic moment enhances linearly with the size , we find an increasing trend of memory fraction .",
    "one more interesting aspect is that the memory fraction of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles are more than that of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in all the cases . thus using the scale of memory fraction ,",
    "we conclude that for smaller size distributions , memory effect is stronger in antiferromagnetic nanoparticles than ferromagnetic particles . however , it is obvious that for larger sizes distributions , memory effect in ferromagnetic particles exceeds to their antiferromagnetic counterpart .",
    "we have examined the magnetization relaxation in nio nanoparticles by a series of heating and cooling processes to understand the memory effects as discussed by sun _",
    "et al_. @xcite these relaxation studies are performed under both the zfc and the trm protocol .    in a zfc protocol for the distribution _",
    "dist.a _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](a ) , the sample is cooled down to @xmath40 in a zero field and a magnetic field @xmath41 is applied after zero wait time .",
    "the magnetization relaxation is calculated as a function of time for time interval @xmath42 .",
    "after @xmath43 interval , we employ following three distinct routes , either changing temperature or applying magnetic field to study the relaxation for time @xmath44 .",
    "* - negative - temperature cycle : the sample is quenched in constant field to a lower temperature , @xmath45 , and the magnetization is recorded for @xmath46 time interval . * - field - change cycle : the sample is quenched to a lower temperature , @xmath47 with cutting off the magnetic field , and the magnetization is recorded for @xmath46 time period .",
    "* - positive - temperature cycle : the sample is quenched in constant field to a higher temperature , @xmath48 , and the magnetization is recorded again for @xmath46 time period .",
    "at last we bring the system back to initial temperature @xmath40 and a constant field @xmath41 and find the relaxation for interval @xmath49 .",
    "we find that during negative - temperature cycle for interval @xmath46 , the particles which were dynamically active at @xmath50 becomes frozen at lower temperature @xmath51 and the smaller particles which should be dynamically active at @xmath52 have already been polarized during interval @xmath43 , hence the relaxation becomes very weak during @xmath46 and a flat relaxation can be be observed in the figure .",
    "when the temperature returns to @xmath50 , the magnetization also comes back to the level it reached before the temporary cooling .",
    "moreover , by plotting the data points during @xmath53 and @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](b ) , we find a continuity between two regions . during the field - change cycle",
    ", we find that the relaxation during @xmath46 is fast with opposite sign but as we return back to @xmath50 with a field @xmath41 again applied , the magnetization again comes back to the level as before temporary cooling and field change and the relaxation curves during @xmath43 and @xmath53 are continuous ( fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](c ) ) .",
    "these results validate the memory effects and also show that the relaxation at lower temperatures has no influence on the states at higher temperatures . finally during positive - temperature cycle , raising the temperature enhances the number of dynamically active particles which are taking part in relaxation process .",
    "the particles which were frozen at @xmath50 become dynamically active at increased temperature and polarize themselves during @xmath46 interval .",
    "as we return back to initial temperature @xmath50 , these particles remain frozen in polarized state .",
    "hence the relaxation curves during @xmath43 and @xmath53 show an abrupt jump in magnetization as shown in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](d ) .",
    "cc +    we have also performed the relaxation studies in trm protocol . here , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](e ) , the sample is cooled down to @xmath40 in a magnetic field @xmath41 . the field is cut off for a zero wait time and the magnetization relaxation is calculated as a function of time . after a time interval @xmath54 , again we employ following three different processes to study the relaxation for @xmath55 .",
    "* - negative - temperature cycle : the sample is quenched in zero field to a lower temperature , @xmath45 , and the magnetization is considered for interval @xmath56 . * - field - change cycle : the sample is quenched to a lower temperature , @xmath47 with the magnetic field @xmath41 applied , and the magnetization is considered again for a time @xmath56 . * - positive - temperature cycle : the sample is quenched in zero field to a higher temperature , @xmath48 , and the magnetization is considered for a time @xmath57 .",
    "at last we quench all the above three processes separately to @xmath40 with zero field to observe the relaxation for interval @xmath58 .",
    "we have also shown the magnetization during @xmath43 and @xmath53 for the three different processes occurred during @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](f ) , [ rlxzfc](g ) and [ rlxzfc](h ) .",
    "we find that the logarithmic relaxations in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](f ) and fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](g ) are continuous which again indicates the memory effect . on the other hand during the positive - temperature cycle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rlxzfc](h ) , the magnetization is not continuous .",
    "this is because the bigger size particles , which were frozen at @xmath50 , become dynamically active at higher temperature @xmath59 .",
    "these particles depolarize themselves during @xmath46 interval and remain frozen in depolarized state , when temperature is brought back to lower temperature @xmath60 .",
    "the above relaxation studies in zfc and trm protocols reveal that the negative - temperature cycle and field - change cycle show memory effect , while positive - temperature cycle does not imprint memory during the cycle .",
    "thus the memory effect is only due to the fast relaxation of smaller particles which respond to temporary cooling and field change .",
    "aging effect is a well studied phenomenon in spin glass system.@xcite recently it has gained a lot of attention in the system of nanoparticles , where slow dynamics study becomes important to characterize both the superspin glass behavior and the superparamagnetism.@xcite most of the experiments are performed by measurement of time - dependent zfc and trm magnetizations . in a trm protocol",
