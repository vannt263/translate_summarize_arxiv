    "protoplanetary disks are formed as natural by - products of star formation processes .",
    "while extensive observations and theoretical studies have been carried out , formation and evolution of the disks still remain the subject of active investigation .",
    "obviously , the most important factor here is distribution and transport of the angular momentum in star forming clouds .",
    "in particular , distribution of the angular momentum in infalling envelopes is very important because it will control future evolution of circumstellar disks , and also because it can retain some information about the initial conditions of star formation processes .",
    "extensive observations have been performed to retrieve the dynamical information within star forming clouds .",
    "various molecular lines are used depending on densities and scales of interest . compiling those results ,",
    "apparently there is a universal trend in the rotation profiles .",
    "@xcite have found the relations between the trend of the rotation profiles and dynamics of the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores . in the large scale , typically @xmath5 ,",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath6 increases as the radius increases like @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this distribution likely reflects the initial conditions of the molecular cloud cores , possibly the turbulent velocity fields following the larson s law @xcite . on the other hand , rotating protoplanetary disks with keplerian rotation have been observed in the small scales ( @xmath8 ) around the central young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the envelopes still maintain some information about the initial conditions , the disks with the keplerian rotation have experienced angular momentum transport and forgotten the initial conditions . in the intermediate scales between the keplerian disks and molecular clouds ,",
    "where the gas in the envelope is infalling , interestingly the specific angular momentum distribution appears almost flat ( @xmath9 , fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that this can be interpreted as a consequence of `` conservation of angular momentum '' in the infalling envelope ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scale ,",
    "the specific angular momentum is indeed conserved because the infall speed is much larger than the rotation speed , or in other words , the dynamical ( free - fall ) time scale is much shorter than that of angular momentum transport .",
    "although the conservation of the angular momentum itself is physically plausible , it is not sufficient to explain the flat distribution because the conservation of angular momentum only means that the specific angular momentum of a gas element is conserved in time , i.e. @xmath10 . on the other hand , the flat distribution of specific angular momentum means that the specific angular momentum of each gas element in the intermediate region is almost the same . in order to make the angular momentum distribution",
    "spatially uniform , this argument additionally requires that the initial specific angular momentum distribution must be uniform ; @xmath11 or @xmath12 is constant .",
    "this is , however , quite unlikely as it is contradictory to observations indicating larger velocity dispersions in larger scales .",
    "moreover , this flat profile is virtually universal in many observed star forming clouds . therefore , we need a robust physical mechanism to explain this appearance , which is independent from or only weakly depends on specific initial conditions .    gravitational collapse of rotating clouds is investigated by numerous previous studies .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation and evolution of circumstellar disks approximating the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds as spherical collapse in an outer region and ballistic trajectories in an inner region .",
    "@xcite extended the self - similar solution of the inside - out collapse of a singular isothermal sphere @xcite to include the effect of rotation .",
    "numerical simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating clouds are also investigated and self - similar behaviors are found @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a self - similar solution of gravitational collapse of rotating a thin disk and discussed the evolution of the disks before and after the protostar formation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite compared the analytic models of gravitational collapse of rotating clouds with the observed angular velocity distributions these studies adopted isothermal spheres with rigid - body rotation as initial conditions and assumed that the time evolution of the clouds were given by the inside - out collapse .    in this work ,",
    "we develop an analytic model of unmagnetized infalling envelope that reproduces the results of numerical simulations in order to investigate the time evolution of infalling envelope .",
    "this model does not use the singular isothermal sphere but can be used for general spherically symmetric initial density profile . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the origin of these rotational profiles in star forming clouds .",
    "in particular , we show that while the angular momentum is conserved at the intermediate scale , the flat distribution is a consequence of elongation due to the velocity gradient in infalling envelopes .",
    "this model can be used for estimating the ages of protostars solely from the rotation profiles , and we apply it to well - studied young stellar objects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we construct an analytic model of the angular momentum distribution in collapsing clouds .",
    "we demonstrate its validity in comparison with numerical simulations in  3 and provide case studies for well - studied young stellar objects with circumstellar disks such as l1527 irs , tmc-1a and b335 in  4 .  5 and  6",
    "are devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we construct an analytic model of infalling envelopes . the goal is to provide a simple but useful model explaining the angular momentum distributions in observations and numerical simulations .",
    "before the gas element gets close to its centrifugal radius , it falls almost radially .",
    "therefore , the effect of rotation is not dynamically important and is negligible in the outer regionau ) . ]",
    "( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . in reality , highly non - linear angular momentum transport by self - gravity or magnetic fields dominates the evolution in that small - scale , which anyway is very difficult to handle analytically .",
    "thus we only discuss the infalling envelope here .",
    "we exclude the region near the central object from our model assuming that a circumstellar disk with a keplerian rotation profile is formed there .    in this situation",
    ", we can assume that the accretion flow is spherically symmetric ; the gravitational force is approximated to be @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the enclosed mass within the radius @xmath15 , and the specific angular momentum @xmath6 is conserved and passively advected .",
    "note that @xmath14 is constant on the gas element s frame in this treatment ; @xmath16 , so hereafter we omit the subscript .",
    "also , we assume that the gas collapses isothermally , i.e. @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sound speed and is constant .",
    "then , the equation of motion of the gas element for the radial velocity @xmath19 becomes : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is order of unity ; for example , it is @xmath22 when the density profile is close to the larson - penston solution , @xmath23 in the outer region @xcite .",
    "we approximate this value is constant in time but depends on the initial radius of the gas element ; @xmath24 . under this assumption ,",
    "the pressure force is proportional to @xmath25 ; @xmath26 .",
    "since the gravitational force is proportional to @xmath27 , the ratio of the pressure force to the gravitational force decreases as the radius of the gas element decreases .",
    "in other words , the gas pressure becomes less important as the gravitational collapse proceeds .",
    "therefore , we estimate @xmath28 by using initial density distribution to reproduce the initial pressure force @xcite . because this gas pressure decreases the infall velocity , the infall velocity is smaller than the free - fall velocity . using @xmath28 estimated from initial density distribution",
    ", we can calculate the motion of the gas element locally including the effect of the gas pressure without knowing the density distribution , and greatly simplify the equation of motion :    @xmath29    then we introduce another non - dimensional value @xmath30 which is proportional to the ratio between the gravitational potential to the thermal energy density at the initial radius ; @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 is usually positive because @xmath33 is typically negative in a collapsing cloud . also , @xmath32 is constant in time but spatially not uniform in general , and it is determined by the initial condition .",

    "we define a new dimensionless radius @xmath37 and then integrate this equation .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean gas density within @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the free - fall time .",
    "this equation gives the location of a gas element , @xmath42 , as a function of time and initial radius . using this equation",
    ", we can calculate distribution of the specific angular momentum given an initial condition .",
    "because @xmath0 is conserved , it is simply transported by the motion of the gas element ; @xmath43 .    for later use ,",
    "we calculate how long it takes for a gas element at an initial radius @xmath40 to reach the center of the cloud .",
    "this time @xmath44 can be calculated from equation ( [ pos ] ) by taking the limit of @xmath45 .",
    "this time depends only on @xmath30 if it is normalized by the free - fall time @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 when @xmath30 is large and the pressure force is not significant , the right hand side of equation ( [ tc ] ) is unity , and the time that a gas element takes to reach the center is given by the free - fall time .",
    "evolution of the density distribution can be also calculated from equation  ( [ pos ] ) .",
    "since the mass within a shell of thickness @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is constant , we can calculate the density distribution from the following equation : @xmath50 @xmath15 and @xmath48 are obtained from equation  ( [ pos ] ) . using equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) and the @xmath15 derivative of equation ( [ pos ] ) , we obtain @xmath51^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume that @xmath30 is spatially uniform .",
    "hereafter we use a model that @xmath30 is spatially constant , which is explained as follows .",
    "for example , let us consider a super - critical bonnor - ebert ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter be ) sphere with solid - body rotation as the initial condition .",
    "this initial condition is often used in numerical simulations to model an isolated dense molecular cloud core .",
    "first we construct a critical be sphere with a central density of @xmath52 , a temperature of @xmath53 k , a radius of @xmath54 and an angular velocity of @xmath55 . because the be sphere is an equilibrium state , it does not collapse immediately . to make it gravitationally unstable",
    ", we increase the whole density of be sphere by @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this method has been often used in calculations for the gravitational collapse of cloud cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the evolution of the profiles in the disk mid - plane ( the plane that perpendicular to the rotation axis , where the specific angular momentum of the gas element is @xmath58 ) are shown in the left panels of figure  [ ana ] .",
    "because we consider that the angular momentum is transported purely passively , this model can not account for a rotationally supported disk and is valid only in the region beyond the centrifugal radius .",
    "to show the dependence of the analytic model on the parameter @xmath30 , the evolution of the radial profiles of the specific angular momentum in the mid - plane , initial radius , infall velocity and gas density with @xmath59 are shown in the right panels of figure  [ ana ] .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those used for the previous calculation whose results are shown in left panels of fig .",
    "the nature of all profiles is the same as the nature of the profiles shown in left panels in fig .",
    "[ ana ] , except the timescale of the gravitational collapse . for larger @xmath30 , the collapse timescale becomes shorter because the gas pressure is less significant and the free - fall times is shorter due to the higher initial density .",
    "the model successfully reproduces the tendency observed in star forming clouds .",
    "while the outer region of the infalling envelope maintains the initial angular momentum distribution , the specific angular momentum looks almost constant in the inner region . while the specific angular momentum is indeed conserved in this model , what actually is crucial is the radial velocity gradient in the infalling envelope .",
    "the gas element originally located at a smaller radius attains higher radial velocity than one at a greater radius due to the stronger gravity .",
    "this property is common in any run - away collapse solution including the larson - penston solution .",
    "this radial velocity gradient elongates the infalling envelope radially .",
    "it is clearly visible in the plot of the initial radius of fig [ ana ] that the gas elements in the inner region originally come from similar initial radii .",
    "because the specific angular momentum of gas elements is conserved , the elongation of the infalling envelope elongates the initial angular distribution and makes it look flat .",
    "therefore the region with constant specific angular momentum can be formed simply as a consequence of strong elongation in a run - away collapse of a cloud , regardless of the initial angular momentum distribution .",
    "this flat specific angular momentum distribution also appears in the self - similar solutions of the gravitational collapse of rotating spherical clouds @xcite and flattened disks @xcite .",
    "the flat region elongates and the specific angular momentum in this region gets higher as time passes by , which can be used as an indicator of the age of the system .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it only uses the kinetic information which can be easily acquired , and does not rely on the stellar evolution model .",
    "we demonstrate this in section [ comparison ] in comparison with observations .",
    "in order to demonstrate the validity and limitation of the analytic model , we compare it with a hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "we perform a three - dimensional nested - grid hydrodynamic simulation with self - gravity @xcite . for hydrodynamic part",
    ", the second - order accurate muscl scheme and roe s riemann solver are used .",
    "self - gravity is solved with the multi - grid solver developed by @xcite .",
    "the basic equations are as follows : @xmath60 the gravitational potential is composed of two parts : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of the sink particle described below , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the gravitational potential due to the sink particle and the gas . in order to mimic the thermal evolution ,",
    "the following barotropic approximation is used : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the critical density that the gas becomes adiabatic , and the effective adiabatic index @xmath67 is @xmath68 . in order to follow the long - term evolution , we introduce a sink particle .",
    "the calculation is started without the sink particle .",
    "the sink particle is placed at the centre of the cloud core when the density within radius @xmath691 au becomes greater than the threshold density @xmath70 .",
    "the gas exceeding the threshold density in the region @xmath71 is removed , and the mass of the removed gas added to the mass of the sink particle @xmath62 .",
    "note that , however , the details of the simulation are not of crucial importance because we only discuss the structure of the infalling envelope .",
    "the initial condition is the same as in the previous section , a super - critical be - like sphere ( the central density is @xmath52 , a temperature is @xmath53 k , a radius is @xmath54 , an angular velocity of @xmath55 , and the density is increased by @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) ) .",
    "all the variables at the surface of the be sphere is fixed to the initial values to model a dense molecular cloud core confined in a static interstellar medium .",
    "the results at @xmath72 yr , @xmath73 yr , @xmath74 yr , and @xmath75 yr are shown in figure  [ sim ] along with the analytic solution .",
    "the blue dotted and dashed lines show the results of the numerical simulation and thin black lines show the results of the analytic model . at @xmath76",
    "yr , the analytic model and the numerical simulation show the different distributions .",
    "this is because the protostar is not formed in the numerical simulation , although it is already formed in the analytic model .",
    "the density and velocity distributions before and after the protostar formation are completely different : the former are similar to the larson - penston solution @xcite and the latter are similar to the shu solution @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the analytic model tends to underestimate the infall time of the envelope ( equation ( [ pos ] ) ) and the protostar formation time .",
    "the underestimation of the infall time comes from the modeling of the pressure . in our model",
    ", the ratio of pressure gradient to gravitational forces decreases monotonically as the gas collapses toward the center .",
    "however , the numerical simulation shows that the ratio increases with time at first in the inner region where the included mass is smaller than about the jeans mass .",
    "this means that the analytic model underestimates the pressure gradient force acting on the inner region , and this results in the underestimation of the infall time .    to avoid the underestimation of the infall time before the protostar formation",
    ", we introduce a correction factor into equation ( [ pos ] ) . the corrected infall time is given as follows , @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the jeans mass defined by the central density . the correction factor",
    "@xmath80 increases the infall time for @xmath81 .",
    "the results of the corrected models are shown by the red dashed lines in figure [ sim ] .",
    "the corrected model can reproduce the numerical simulation at @xmath82 yr .",
    "the results of the model at the other times also reproduce the simulation better than that of the previous model .",
    "we use the model with the correction factor @xmath80 in the following sections . note that our model can reproduce the pressure gradient force for the outer region where the included mass is larger than about the jeans mass .",
    "thus , for the later stage of the collapse , the results of the model without the correction factor are similar to those of the numerical simulation formation .",
    "even at @xmath83 yr , the specific angular momentum and infall velocity of the numerical simulation and the analytic model without the correction factor agree with each other well , within a factor of 2.2 .    in the simulation , rotationally - supported circumstellar disks with a radius of @xmath84 au at @xmath85 yr , @xmath86 au at @xmath87 yr , and @xmath88 au at @xmath89 yr are formed .",
    "the analytic solution is not applicable to this region because the effect of the centrifugal force is not included in the model .",
    "the analytic solution reproduces the distribution along the rotational axis ( @xmath90 , dotted lines ) better because the angular momentum is passively transported and has no dynamical effect in the analytic model .",
    "in this section , we discuss how to apply our model to real observations of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that our model can provide an independent estimate of the age of the system .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the dynamics of infalling envelope in the mid - plane .    in order to apply our theoretical model ,",
    "we first need to estimate the initial density distribution . because we can not observe the initial conditions , we assume a super - critical be - like sphere as in section  2 , with parameters @xmath91 and @xmath53 k. the uncertainty associated with @xmath30",
    "is discussed later in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the initial density distribution , which is proportional to that of be sphere , is approximately given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the central density , @xmath94 is a normalized radial coordinate , @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite , therefore this profile must be used within a finite radius . ] .",
    "then we need to estimate the initial central density of the cloud @xmath97 from the observed values .",
    "for this purpose , we use two observed values : the mass of the central protostar @xmath98 and the specific angular momentum @xmath99 in the inner envelope where @xmath99 looks spatially constant .",
    "@xmath98 can be determined using the rotation profile in the keplerian disk . in the inner envelope",
    ", we can safely assume that the enclosed mass within this region is dominated by the central protostar , i.e. @xmath100 where @xmath101 .    because the specific angular momentum is almost conserved in the envelope",

    "the density profile of the be sphere is almost constant inside the radius @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath93 is the central density .",
    "the radius @xmath153 increases as the temperature increases . for the clouds observed by @xcite",
    ", @xmath153 is too small when we use the temperature obtained from the observation , @xmath155 k. the effective temperature @xmath156 exceeds @xmath157 by a factor of @xmath158 . on the other hand , with the density distribution we adopt in this work , density is almost constant inside the radius @xmath159 . thus , we can fit the observed density profile when we adopt @xmath160 k and @xmath161 .",
    "the relation of @xmath30 , @xmath157 and @xmath156 is @xmath162 .",
    "since @xcite have obtained @xmath163 , observations of the cloud cores suggest that the parameter @xmath30 is typically higher than unity and the uncertainty associated with @xmath30 is smaller than two .      as described above",
    ", observations of molecular cloud cores indicate that the density profile is well fitted by that of the be spheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we develop the analytic model for the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core whose density profile is similar to that of be sphere . in general , star forming cloud cores are not isolated but embedded in molecular clouds .",
    "recent observations have revealed that the cloud cores are in the filamentary clouds . in this work",
    ", we do not take into account the effect of the external region of molecular cloud cores on the gravitational collapse . because the timescale of the gravitational collapse at the center of the molecular cloud is shorter than the timescale at the outer region , the external region is not expected to affect the collapse at the center in the early phase of star formation .",
    "for example , the model with @xmath57 used in section [ analytic_model ] has the free - fall time of @xmath164 yr at the center . on the other hand , at 10000 au which is the typical size of a molecular cloud core , it is @xmath165 yr .",
    "therefore , the external region is not expected to affect the gravitational collapse and the structure of the envelope when the protostar age is smaller than about @xmath166 yr .    @xcite and @xcite have pointed out that even when the observed column density profile of the cloud core is well fitted by that of the be sphere , the actual density distribution of the core can be different from that of the be sphere . when the initial condition significantly deviates from the be sphere adopted here ( for example , when the gravitational collapse of the core starts because of cloud - cloud collision or when the cloud core contains strong turbulence ) , our simple analytic model can not be applied .",
    "also , when the initial angular momentum distribution has a discontinuity ( e.g. , when gas with a completely different angular momentum flows into the cloud core ) , such a discontinuous structure will remain in the infalling envelope because it can not be smoothed out by elongation .",
    "the investigation of such a complex structure of infalling envelope is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "there is another uncertainty associated with the initial specific angular momentum distribution . in section [ comparison ] ,",
    "we use the relation between the radius of the molecular clouds and their rotation velocity obtained from the observations of many nh@xmath167 cores @xcite as the initial rotation profile ( equation ( [ eq : j_c ] ) ) .",
    "this is not the spatially - resolved rotation velocity distribution of a single molecular cloud .",
    "l1544 is one of the molecular clouds for which the spatially resolved rotation velocity profile has been obtained from observations @xcite .",
    "the specific angular momentum of l1544 is fitted by rigid rotation as follows : @xmath168}\\right)^2 [ \\rm km \\ pc \\ s^{-1}]\\label{eq : rot_l1544}\\ ] ] when we adopt this as the initial specific angular momentum distribution of l1527 , the estimated age is @xmath169 yr .",
    "this age is similar to the age obtained in section [ comparison ] ( @xmath170 yr ) .",
    "when we apply equation ( [ eq : rot_l1544 ] ) as the initial specific angular distribution of tmc-1a , we obtain @xmath171 yr .",
    "this age is also similar to the age obtained in section [ comparison ] ( @xmath172 yr ) .",
    "it is technically possible to use the observed large - scale velocity gradient of each molecular cloud cores as the initial rotation profile .",
    "for example , the large - scale ( @xmath173 pc ) velocity gradient of l1527 obtained from @xmath174 observation with the iram 30 m single - dish telescope by @xcite is about @xmath175 .",
    "however , interestingly enough , this large - scale velocity gradient is often mis - aligned or even counter - rotating to the rotation in the smaller scale , probably reflecting the nature of turbulence in the interstellar media @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider this as the characteristic specific angular momentum distribution of l1527 . in this case , the protostar age of l1527 is @xmath176 yr .",
    "this is in good agreement with the age obtained in section [ comparison ] .",
    "the age of l1527 estimated in this work and the dynamical age obtained in @xcite is summarized in table [ agesl1527 ] .",
    "the results are apparently not very sensitive to the initial rotation in each object , because the initial rotation is more or less universal .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this work , we neglect effects of magnetic field for simplicity .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the star formation is actively investigated using numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the magnetic field in clouds is strong enough , there are two important effects of the magnetic field on the infalling envelope .",
    "one is that the infall velocity decreases due to magnetic force .",
    "the infall velocity of l1527 estimated from the observation is smaller than free - fall velocity estimated from the central star mass @xcite .",
    "this difference may be caused by the magnetic fields .",
    "when the infall velocity decreases due to the magnetic pressure , our analytic model underestimates @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the other is the angular momentum transfer of the infalling envelope by magnetic braking .",
    "the angular momentum of the infalling envelope in the midplane is transferred to the upper region due to the magnetic braking . as a result , the observed angular momentum is smaller than the initial angular momentum , and we underestimate the initial radius of the infalling envelope if we assume the conservation of the angular momentum in the infalling envelope .",
    "thus , our analytic model should give the lower limit of @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    to estimate the protostar age in the strongly magnetized clouds , we need to extend our model to take into account the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "we propose a simple analytic model to describe the structure and evolution of collapsing clouds .",
    "although this model is so simple that it considers only gravity and gas pressure with an approximated treatment in quasi spherically symmetric configuration , it can successfully reproduce the result of the hydrodynamic simulation and provide a reasonable fit to observational data .",
    "while this model includes neither the effects of rotation nor magnetic fields , it is still applicable to the outer region where the rotation velocity is still small and magnetic braking is not significant .",
    "we showed that the region with constant specific angular momentum can be formed as a consequence of strong elongation in a run - away collapse of a cloud , regardless of the initial angular momentum distribution .",
    "we have also provided a simple method to estimate the ages of protostars based on our model , using information of the rotational profile only .",
    "this information can be obtained from easily accessible molecular line observations .",
    "we applied our model to l1527 , tmc-1a and b335 , and obtained the protostar ages of , @xmath170 yr , @xmath179 yr , and @xmath180 yr , respectively .",
    "our model will be useful to study the dynamics in the infalling envelope of young stellar objects and related circumstellar disk formation , especially for the present and future observation with alma .",
