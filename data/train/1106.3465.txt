    "a number of hadron properties are well described by the quark model where mesons have quantum numbers @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the quantum numbers for the quark - antiquark orbital angular momentum and their net spin angular momentum respectively .",
    "the states with @xmath8 ( for the lowest lying hybrids in the flux tube model ) can not be formed from a @xmath9 pair and hence are not allowed in the quark model .",
    "these states are signals for exotic mesons ( hybrids , glueballs , etc ) .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , describing the interaction between quarks and gluonic field , predicts the existence of hybrid mesons containing the excited gluonic field .",
    "thus for understanding of qcd , we need to find experimentally testable predictions of the theory for situations in which the gluonic field between a quark and antiquark is in an excited state .",
    "thus hybrids are an important source of information related to confining properties of qcd , and checking for existence of hybrid mesons is very important objective of particle physics .",
    "reviews of the spectrum of excited gluonic states can be found in ref .",
    "recently , a resonance is observed at compass  @xcite with @xmath10 .",
    "some other groups like ves  @xcite , e852  @xcite , and the crystal barrel collaboration  @xcite also observed these states .    using the born - oppenheimer approach , the work of finding implications of qcd for a meson can be split into first using the numerical lattice simulations of qcd to fit parameters of a quark antiquark potential and then using this potential to calculate its dynamical implications .",
    "even a numerically defined potential can be used in this scheme , as in refs .",
    "@xcite  @xcite .",
    "these works use some potentials to calculate hybrid masses and few radial probability graphs ( but presents no @xmath11 wave function expressions or uses . ) .",
    "what we add to this work is that now we suggest a number of analytical expressions for the excited state gluonic field potential between a quark and antiquark and fit their parameters to the lattice data for the ground and excited state gluonic field energy values available in ref .",
    "@xcite for discrete quark antiquark separations . for each case",
    ", we report a dimensionless chisquare and other measures directly telling how much fractional error each model has in fitting .",
    "we use this variety of potentials to indicate suitable ones for different applications , for example for analytical calculations of expectation values in few - body wave functions where a numerical approach may have convergence problems .",
    "our full list of chisquare and other error measures tells how much extra error is generated in preferring the flux tube model and other integrable forms over the ones that can be only numerically used but fit better . after using these potentials to find the quark - antiquark wave functions , we also calculate a number of conventional and hybrid meson rms radii and square of radial wave functions at the origin .",
    "we continue till writing some implications of these for scalar form factors , energy shifts , magnetic polarizabilities , decay constants , decay widths and differential cross sections of conventional and hybrid mesons .",

    "one possible reason is that we are dealing with heavy quarks so the @xmath55 factor ( shown in eq . ) of the hyperfine term becomes very small .",
