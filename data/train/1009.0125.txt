    "this paper is concerned with a concrete characterization of continuous functions that are nonnegative on a closed set @xmath1 and its application for optimization purposes . by concrete we mean a systematic procedure , e.g. a numerical test that can be implemented by an algorithm , at least in some interesting cases . for polynomials ,",
    "stengle s nichtnegativstellensatz @xcite provides a certificate of nonnegativity ( or absence of nonnegativity ) on a semi - algebraic set .",
    "moreover , in principle , this certificate can be obtained by solving a single semidefinite program ( although the size of this semidefinite program is far beyond the capabilities of today s computers ) .",
    "similarly , for compact basic semi - algebraic sets , schmdgen s and putinar s positivstellenstze @xcite provide certificates of strict positivity that can be obtained by solving finitely many semidefinite programs ( of increasing size ) .",
    "extensions of those certificates to some algebras of non - polynomial functions have been recently proposed in lasserre and putinar @xcite and in marshall and netzer @xcite . however , and to the best of our knowledge , there is still no hierarchy of explicit ( outer or inner ) semidefinite approximations ( with or without lifting ) of the cone of polynomials nonnegative on a closed set @xmath4 , except if @xmath4 is compact and basic semi - algebraic ( in which case outer approximations exist ) .",
    "another exception is the convex cone of quadratic forms nonnegative on @xmath8 for which inner and outer approximations are available ; see e.g. anstreicher and burer @xcite , and dr @xcite .",
    "+ * contribution : * in this paper , we present a different approach based on a new ( at least to the best of our knowledge ) and simple characterization of continuous functions that are nonnegative on a closed set @xmath1 .",
    "this characterization involves a _ single _ ( but known ) measure @xmath5 with @xmath3 , and sums of squares of polynomials .",
    "namely , our contribution is twofold :    \\(a ) we first show that a continuous function @xmath0 is nonnegative on a closed set @xmath1 if and only if @xmath9 is nonnegative for all polynomials @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath5 is a finite borel measure on @xmath7 is a nonnegative set function defined on the borel @xmath11-algebra of @xmath7 ( i.e. , the @xmath11-algebra generated by the open sets ) , such that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for any collection of disjoint measurable sets @xmath15 . its support ( denoted @xmath16 )",
    "is the smallest closed set @xmath4 such that @xmath17 ; see e.g. royden @xcite . ] with @xmath3 .",
    "the measure @xmath5 is arbitrary if @xmath4 is compact .",
    "if @xmath4 is not compact then one may choose for @xmath5 the finite borel measure :    - @xmath18 if @xmath0 is a polynomial , and    - @xmath19 , if @xmath0 is not a polynomial ,    where @xmath20 is any finite borel measure with support exactly @xmath4 .",
    "but many other choices are possible .",
    "equivalently , @xmath0 is nonnegative on @xmath4 if and only if every element of the countable family @xmath21 of moment matrices associated with the signed borel measure @xmath22 , is positive semidefinite",
    ". the absence of nonnegativity on @xmath4 can be _ certified _ by exhibiting a polynomial @xmath10 $ ] such that @xmath23 , or equivalently , when some moment matrix in the family @xmath21 is not positive semidefinite . and so , interestingly , as for nonnegativity or positivity , our certificate for absence of nonnegativity is also in terms of sums of squares",
    ". when @xmath0 is a polynomial , these moment matrices are easily obtained from the moments of @xmath5 and this criterion for absence of nonnegativity complements stengle s nichtnegativstellensatz @xcite ( which provides a certificate of nonnegativity on a semi - algebraic set @xmath4 ) or schmdgen and putinar s positivstellenstze @xcite ( for certificates of strict positivity on compact basic semi - algebraic sets ) . at last",
    "but not least , we obtain a convergent _ explicit _ hierarchy of semidefinite ( outer ) approximations with _ no _ lifting , of the cone @xmath24 of nonnegative polynomials of degree at most @xmath25 . that is , we obtain a nested sequence @xmath26 such that each @xmath27 is a spectrahedron defined solely in terms of the vector of coefficients of the polynomial , with no additional variable ( i.e. , no projection is needed ) .",
    "similar explicit hierarchies can be obtained for the cone of polynomials nonnegative on a closed set @xmath4 ( neither necessarily basic semi - algebraic nor compact ) , provided that all moments of an appropriate measure @xmath5 ( with support exactly @xmath4 ) can be obtained . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is first result of this kind .",
    "\\(b ) as a potential application , we consider the problem of computing the _ global _ minimum @xmath28 of a polynomial @xmath0 on a closed set @xmath4 , a notoriously difficult problem . in nonlinear programming , a sequence of upper bounds on @xmath28",
    "is usually obtained from a sequence of feasible points @xmath29 , e.g. , via some ( local ) minimization algorithm .",
    "but it is important to emphasize that for non convex problems , providing a sequence of upper bounds @xmath30 , @xmath31 , that converges to @xmath28 is in general impossible , unless one computes points on a grid whose mesh size tends to zero .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath1 is a closed set for which one may compute all moments of a measure @xmath5 with @xmath3 .",
    "typical examples of such sets are e.g. @xmath32 or @xmath8 in the non compact case and a box , a ball , an ellipsoid , a simplex , or the vertices of an hypercube ( or hyper rectangle ) in the compact case .",
    "we then provide a hierarchy of semidefinite programs ( with only one variable ! )",
    "whose optimal values form a monotone nonincreasing sequence of _ upper _ bounds which converges to the global minimum @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , each semidefinite program is a very specific one as it reduces to solving a _ generalized eigenvalue _ problem for a pair of real symmetric matrices .. ( therefore , for efficiency one may use specialized software packages instead of a sdp solver . )",
    "however , the convergence to @xmath28 is in general only asymptotic and not finite ( except when @xmath4 is a discrete set in which case finite convergence takes place ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations defined in lasserre @xcite which provide a nondecreasing sequence of _ lower _ bounds that also converges to @xmath28 , and very often in finitely many steps .",
    "hence , for compact basic semi - algebraic sets these two convergent hierarchies of upper and lower bounds complement each other and permit to locate the global minimum @xmath28 in smaller and smaller intervals .",
    "notice that convergence of the hierarchy of convex relaxations in @xcite is guaranteed only for compact basic semi - algebraic sets , whereas for the new hierarchy of upper bounds , the only requirement on @xmath4 is to know all moments of a measure @xmath5 with @xmath3 . on the other hand , in general computing such moments",
    "is possible only for relatively simple ( but not necessarily compact nor semi - algebraic ) sets .",
    "at last but not least , the nonincreasing sequence of upper bounds converges to @xmath28 even if @xmath28 is not attained , which when @xmath32 , could provide an alternative and/or a complement to the hierarchy of convex relaxations provided in schweighofer @xcite ( based on gradient tentacles ) and in h and pham @xcite ( based on the truncated tangency variety ) , which both provide again a monotone sequence of lower bounds .",
    "finally , we also give a very simple interpretation of the hierarchy of dual semidefinite programs , which provides some information on the location of global minimizers .",
    "a borel measure on @xmath7 is understood as a _ positive _ borel measure , i.e. , a nonnegative set function @xmath5 on the borel @xmath11-algebra @xmath33 ( i.e. , the @xmath11-algebra generated by the open sets of @xmath7 ) such that @xmath12 , and with the countably additive property @xmath34 for any collection of disjoint measurable sets @xmath35 ; see e.g. royden @xcite .",

    "a measure @xmath5 is said to be moment determinate if there is no other measure with same moments .",

    "and so problem ( [ eigenvalue ] ) reduces to a standard eigenvalue problem , namely that of computing the smallest eigenvalue of the ( real and symmetric ) localizing matrix @xmath70 ( expressed in the basis of orthogonal polynomials ) !",
    "and it turns out that computing the orthogonal polynomials is easy once the moment matrix @xmath53 is available , since they can be obtained via computing certain determinants , as explained in e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , observe that the above methodology perfectly fits _ inverse problems _ from moments , where precisely some borel measure @xmath5 is known only from its moments ( via some measurement device ) , and one wishes to recover ( or approximately recover ) its support @xmath4 from the known moments ; see e.g. the work of cuyt et al .",
