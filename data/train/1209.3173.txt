    "neutrino and antineutrino capture reactions play a crucial role in core collapse supernovae .",
    "they provide important heating that may reenergize a shock and lead to the explosion . in addition , these reactions help determine the spectra of radiated @xmath4 and @xmath3 that is important for detection of supernova neutrinos on earth @xcite and for neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "finally the rates of neutrino and antineutrino captures determine the ratio of neutrons to protons in the neutrino driven wind above a proto - neutron star .",
    "this is crucial for nucleosynthesis , see for example @xcite .",
    "supernova neutrinos are radiated from the neutrino - sphere , a warm low density gas of neutron rich matter , with a temperature near @xmath5 mev and a density of order @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "recently roberts @xcite and roberts and reddy @xcite have suggested that strong interaction energy shifts in this gas increase the cross section for @xmath9 by increasing the available phase space , and decrease the cross section for @xmath10 these shifts arise because a proton is more tightly bound in neutron rich matter than is a neutron and this binding energy difference increases the energy of the @xmath11 in eq .   and decrease the energy of the @xmath12 in eq .  .",
    "martinez - pinedo et al .",
    "@xcite have also performed supernova simulations with this energy shift .",
    "however , these works @xcite all calculate the shift in a mean field approximation that is very model dependent at low densities",
    ". therefore the size of the effect may be poorly determined .",
    "the energy shift @xmath13 is the difference in potential energy of a neutron @xmath14 or a proton @xmath15 in the medium .",
    "this is closely related to the symmetry energy that describes how the energy of nuclear matter rises as one moves away from equal numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "the symmetry energy has been calculated at low densities using a virial expansion and found to be large because of correlations and the formation of bound states such as @xmath16he , @xmath17he , and @xmath17h @xcite .",
    "note that these light nuclei may also impact neutrino spectra @xcite .",
    "warm low density nuclear matter can be produced in the laboratory with heavy ion collisions .",
    "kowalski et al . studied collisions of 35 mev / nucleon @xmath18zn projectiles with @xmath19mo and @xmath20au target nuclei and inferred that the symmetry energy at densities of 0.01 to 0.05 times saturation density ranged from 9 to 13.6 mev @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "these large values are in good agreement with virial expansion results .",
    "however , they are much larger than the predictions of many mean field models , see for example refs . @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the energy shifts and in medium cross sections for the reactions in eqs .  , using a virial expansion .",
    "the virial expansion makes model independent predictions for thermodynamic quantities based on elastic scattering phase shifts .",
    "some earlier virial expansion results include the equation of state of pure neutron matter @xcite , the equation of state of nuclear matter including protons , neutrons , and alpha particles @xcite , and the long wavelength neutrino response of pure neutron matter @xcite .",

    "we attribute the reduction to the lower electron fraction found throughout the post shock region , but most importantly around the neutrinospheres ( where @xmath162 between the two simulations is @xmath163 ) .",

    "the potentially significant quantitative changes that arise as a result of the energy shift , both during the preexplosion phase ( as shown here ) and presumably during the postexplosion phase warrant a much more in - depth analysis in future work .",
    "in this section we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "first , as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] , the virial expansion energy shift @xmath0 , at low densities , is much larger than that predicted by many mean field models and leads to much larger changes in neutrino cross sections .",
    "this is a major conclusion of the present paper .",
    "furthermore the virial predictions are based on elastic scattering phase shift data and are model independent .",
    "our preliminary simulations of the accretion phase of core collapse supernovae find that @xmath0 increases the @xmath3 energies and decreases the @xmath4 luminosity , see fig .",
    "[ sims ] .",
    "we expect the energy shifts to have even larger effects on neutrino interactions at higher densities @xmath164 @xmath8 .",
    "however the virial expansion itself may not be directly applicable at these densities .",

    "@xcite , may have difficulties with both the nonuniform matter and the high temperatures , other techniques may be more promising . for example lattice effective field theory @xcite should be directly applicable .",
    "furthermore , eq .   shows that the energy shifts can be directly determined from chemical potentials .",
    "therefore one only needs to calculate the neutron and proton chemical potentials in a microscopic approach in order to determine the energy shifts and their impact on neutrino absorption .",
    "we emphasize that matter at neutrinosphere temperatures and sub - saturation densities can be directly produced in the laboratory with heavy ion collisions , see for example ref .",
    "furthermore , new radioactive beam facilities will allow the study of more neutron rich conditions .",
    "terrestrial experiments can probe the equation of state , symmetry energy , and composition of neutrino sphere like matter .",
    "these properties are important for neutrino interactions in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "large energy shift effects could lower the energy or luminosity of @xmath4 radiated in supernovae .",
    "although about 20 @xmath3 were detected from sn1987a , we have almost no experimental information on @xmath4 energies from sn1987a .",

    "a reduction in the @xmath4 energies or luminosity will likely make the neutrino driven wind above a protoneutron star more neutron rich .",
    "this is important for nucleosynthesis .",
    "perhaps energy shift effects are large enough to provide the necessary free neutrons in order for the r - process to occur in the neutrino driven wind .",
    "our preliminary simulations of the accretion phase of core collapse supernovae should be extended to the explosion and protoneutron star cooling phases using energy shifts that are calculated accurately at higher densities where the virial expansion is not directly valid .",
    "we will present additional simulation results in a later publication .    in conclusion ,",
    "a proton in neutron rich matter is more tightly bound than is a neutron .",
    "this energy shift @xmath0 increases the electron energy in @xmath1 , increasing the available phase space and absorption cross section , see eq .  .",
