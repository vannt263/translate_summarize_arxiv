    "matter_. the primary evidence for the creation of bulk matter at the highest energies  @xcite is the existence of strong collective flow  @xcite .",
    "the dominant feature of flow is the correlation between space and momentum which it generates ; thus , momentum - only observables such as @xmath3 spectra and azimuthal anisotropies  @xcite represent only an indirect projection of the effect .",
    "femtoscopic measurements access space as a function of particle momentum , thus providing the most direct probe of the most crucial feature of heavy ion collisions  ( c.f .",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , flow is manifest by a negative correlation between the `` hbt radius '' and the transverse mass ( @xmath4 ) of the particles  @xcite .",
    "clearly , then , a detailed understanding of femtoscopic measurements in heavy ion collisions is crucial to proving the existence of , or probing the nature of , the bulk system generated in the collision .",
    "it is in fact possible to quantitatively interpret both the femtoscopic and momentum - only observations at rhic in a+a collisions in consistent , flow - dominated models of the system  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all seems well .    however , it is important to understand the system size dependence of the apparent bulk behavior . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possible complications in the comparison of large and small systems .",
    "one of the most exciting signals at rhic is the modification of the jet structure due to the bulk medium . in particular leading particle distributions  @xcite and azimuthal",
    "correlations  @xcite in a+a collisions are strongly suppressed relative to those from p+p collisions , at high @xmath3 .    especially since low @xmath3 observables directly reflect the bulk medium",
    ", it is reasonable to ask whether similar comparisons between au+au and p+p collisions reveal comparable differences in the soft sector .",
    "common measurements of this type include total particle yields , @xmath3 spectra and azimuthal correlations ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "blast - wave fits  @xcite to @xmath3 spectra from p+p collisions indicate sizable radial flow , though smaller than that seen in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic anisotropies from p+p collisions are considered as non - flow contribution to azimuthal correlations in a+a . however , it is far from obvious that the finite values of @xmath5 from p+p collisions  @xcite do not arise from collective flow in the p+p collision _ itself_.    a quark - gluon plasma is usually considered a form of matter .",
    "if a quark - gluon plasma were created in p+p collisions , as suggested by bjorken  @xcite , would it display bulk properties ?",
    "a direct comparison of soft - sector observables in p+p and a+a collisions is necessary , to address these issues  @xcite .",
    "the imminent hadronic and heavy ion program at the lhc brings the relevance of such studies into strong relief .",
    "more light might be brought to bear on this important question through femtoscopic measurements , which probe more directly the space - momentum correlations generated in a collective system .    though not as plentiful as in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "two - pion femtoscopic measurements are common in @xmath6 or @xmath7 collisions  @xcite . in these collisions , too , `` hbt radii '' are observed to fall with @xmath4 .",
    "speculations of the physics behind this observation have included heisenberg uncertainty - based arguments , string - breaking phenomena , and temperature gradients ; an excellent overview may be found in  @xcite .",
    "preliminary measurements by the star collaboration  @xcite even suggest that p+p collisions show similar collective behavior as a+a collisions . distinguishing different physical mechanisms , however , requires a detailed understanding of the correlations themselves .",
    "such an understanding is complicated by the clear observation of non - femtoscopic effects in two - pion correlations in small systems .",
    "for example , in a+a collisions the functional form ( gaussian or not ) fitted to two - pion correlations(e.g .",
    "* ) incorporates only femtoscopic effects .",
    "such fits for smaller systems  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have required additional ad - hoc terms of non - femtoscopic nature .",
    "femtoscopic correlations are those which depend directly on the two - particle coordinate - space separation distribution  ( c.f .",
    "* ) . in general ,",
    "such correlations are confined to low relative velocity .",
    "non - femtoscopic correlations may arise from string fragmentation or global conservation laws , for example , and there is no reason to expect that such correlations appear only in kinematic regimes ( e.g. ranges of relative momentum ) different than the femtoscopic ones .",
    "thus , separating those correlations may be a non - trivial exercise .",
    "non - femtoscopic correlations may arise from a variety of sources .",
    "jets will clearly induce momentum - space correlations between their fragmentation products .",
    "while these effects may not be negligible , the low momentum of the pions under consideration ( @xmath8  gev ) puts us squarely in the region in which factorization breaks down and the jet interpretation becomes significantly murkier . in the kinematic region under consideration , string fragmentation may play a role ; this is an area for future study , though significant model - dependence will be present .",
    "collective bulk flow ( e.g. anisotropic elliptic flow ) will generate @xmath2-body correlations which will project onto the two - body space .",
    "`` clusters '' within events i.e. several independent particle - emitting sources may generate additional structure  @xcite ; indeed , such clusters may be treated as `` large resonances '' with a many - body decay channel .",
    "each of these sources of non - femtoscopic correlations may play a greater or lesser role in a collision , depending upon the physical scenario . in this paper , we do not focus on these sources of correlation .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on effects which must be at play in any physical system  energy and momentum conservation - induced correlations ( emcics ) .",
    "these global conservation laws provide an @xmath2-body constraint on the event , which projects down onto 2-body spaces and should become more pronounced at lower event multiplicity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "emcic effects on femtoscopic correlation functions have been estimated  ( see appendix c of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) recently in the context of a numerical model of bose - einstein correlations from emitting cells , using a rough but fast numerical algorithm to conserve energy - momentum .",

    "et al . _",

    "both studies were confined to correlation functions in one dimension of relative momentum . in this paper , effects of emcics on three - dimensional correlation functions",
    "are studied in detail , using numerical simulations and analytic expressions , both based on the restricted phase - space integral .      in section  [ sec : genbod ] we describe genbod  , an event generator which samples an inclusive momentum distribution subject only to constraints of energy and momentum conservation . in section  [ sec : shd ]",
    "we briefly discuss the harmonic representation which provides a complete and natural characterization of the shape of the correlation function .",
    "an extensive discussion of symmetry constraints on the harmonics is given in appendix  [ app : symmetries ] .",
    "for the next three sections , we focus on events in which only pions are emitted . in section  [ sec : genbod ] we use pion - only events from genbod  to illustrate the effects of varying constraints , frames , and kinematic cuts , on emcics . a method to calculate analytically ( but using information from measured distributions ) emcics is shown in section  [ sec : jyo ] .",
    "this leads to an `` experimentalist s formula , '' given in section  [ sec : formula ] , intended to disentangle emcics from other ( e.g. femtoscopic ) correlations in the data .",
    "the formula involves several approximations which may break down in reality ; these are discussed and effects are evaluated quantitatively .    in section  [ sec : nonid ] we discuss two effects that can complicate a direct comparison of emcics for identical and non - identical particle correlations .",
    "several interesting effects are observed , which might be important for the increasingly common studies of space - time asymmetries .",
    "we find that , for non - identical particles , the `` experimentalist s formula '' is only approximately applicable .",
    "we summarize our discussion in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to clearly understand the role of emcics , we would like to study events in which there is no other physics involved besides the conservation laws .",
    "such a tool has been provided 40 years ago in the form of the genbod  computer program  ( see * ? ? ? * for an excellent write - up of the method and physics ) in the cern library . given a requested total multiplicity ( @xmath2 ) , a list of masses ( @xmath9 ) of emitted particles , and a total amount of energy ( @xmath10 ) to distribute among them ,",
    "genbod  returns an event of random momenta ( four - vectors @xmath11 ) , subject only to the condition of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "more importantly , it returns , for each event , a weight proportional to the probability that the event will actually occur in nature .",
    "thus , it is a much different tool than , say , transport codes like rqmd  @xcite , in which each event returned may be treated as equally probable .",

    "secondly , there is strong sensitivity to the energy `` available '' in the event ; it is not obvious that this is @xmath50 of the collision .",

    "( while correlation functions are insensitive to the single - particle phase - space , the correlations which they measure may , in fact , depend on this phase - space , due to physical effects . )",
    "thus , one would like to calculate emcics , based on the data itself . in this section , we begin by following arguments similar to those in refs  @xcite to obtain correction factors which implement emcics onto multi - particle distributions . in the course of the calculation , we make some simplifying approximations .",
    "the derived expressions are then tested for accuracy against the numerical genbod  simulations .",
    "finally , the expressions are used to extract an `` experimentalist s formula '' discussed in the next section .",
    "danielewicz  @xcite , and later borghini , dinh and ollitrault  @xcite , considered emcic - type effects on two - particle azimuthal correlations ( quantified by @xmath5 and often used as a measure of elliptic flow  @xcite ) .",
    "they focused mostly on transverse momentum ( @xmath53 ) conservation only , but borghini later  @xcite generalized to the case of an arbitrary number @xmath54 of independent ( orthogonal ) spatial dimensions and recently considered momentum conservation effects on three - particle analyses of jet - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below , for correlation functions used in femtoscopy , the conservation of energy generates effects of similar magnitude as those due to conservation of momentum .",
    "we deal only with on - shell particles , for which energy can_not _ be treated as independent of the momentum ( as , say , @xmath55 would be largely independent of @xmath56 ) . thus , unlike the above - mentioned works , we will explicitly begin with the more general multivariate central limit theorem .",

    "[ eq : jyo1 ] , the @xmath62-body momentum distribution , including emcics , is the @xmath62-body distribution _ not _ affected by emcics i.e. just an uncorrelated product of single - particle distributions multiplied by a `` correction factor '' which enforces the emcic .",
    "the numerator of this factor counts the number of configurations in which the remaining @xmath73 on - shell particles conspire to conserve total energy and momentum , and the denominator normalizes the distribution .      to arrive at a useful result , we argue along lines similar to those of  @xcite . the distribution of a large number @xmath74 of uncorrelated momenta @xmath75 is , by the central limit theorem , a multivariate normal distribution @xmath76 here , the average of the sum of 4-momenta is simply related to the single - particle average of the 4-momenta as @xmath77 where @xmath78 finally , in equation  [ eq : clt_fmgeneral ] , @xmath79 denotes the determinant of the matrix @xmath80 . up to a factor of @xmath74 ,",

    "we find also that the @xmath109 term affects @xmath114 ; this may be surprising since @xmath114 quantifies the behavior of the correlation function in the `` out - side '' plane , while @xmath115 is the `` long '' direction in the bertsch - pratt system . clearly , emcics projected onto a 2-particle space are non - trivial objects .",

    "the analytic calculations never reproduce _ exactly _ the simulations ; we discuss this further in the next section .",
    "even for large @xmath2 and energy , the calculations do not exactly reproduce the emcic effects in the simulation .",
    "one reason for this may be found , in fact , in the definition of the average values ( e.g. @xmath111 ) themselves . in equation  [ eq : definerms ] ,",
    "average quantities are calculated using the distribution @xmath118 , which is not affected by emcics . naturally , the only measurable distribution available to the experimentalist ( even when genbod  simulations serve as the `` experiment '' ) is @xmath119 .",
    "thus , it appears the experimentalist can not plug her data into the equations  [ eq : definerms ] and  [ eq : jyoc2firstorder ] to fully calculate emcics .",
    "however , such an ambition would have been hopeless anyhow .",
    "after all , even the total multiplicity @xmath2 ( again , including photons etc ) is rarely fully measured , and in principle @xmath2 is a number of `` primary '' particles , a murky concept in itself . to the practicing femtoscopist , there is a natural solution .",
    "having at hand ( 1 ) educated guesses for the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath112 etc , and ( 2 ) a physically - motivated functional form which connects these quantities to the correlations , one may perform a fit .",
    "let us rewrite equation  [ eq : jyoc2firstorder ] as @xmath120 where @xmath121    the notation @xmath122 in equation  [ eq : formula ] highlights the fact that @xmath123 is a two - particle quantity which depends on @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( or @xmath26 , etc ) . from a practical point of view",

    "the binned functions @xmath122 then automatically reflect the same event and particle selection as the correlation function .",
    "this involves nothing more than adding four more histograms to the several already being constructed by the experimentalist as she processes pairs in the data .    here",
    ", we should emphasize that , in equation  [ eq : formula ] , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 should be calculated in the collision center - of - momentum ( ccm ) frame .",
    "the reason is that equation  [ eq : jyo1 ] ( hence eqs .",
    "[ eq : clt_fmgeneral]-[eq : fitparameters ] ) assumes some fixed total energy and momentum to be conserved .",
    "the event s total energy and momentum ( hence @xmath113 , @xmath132 , etc appearing in eqs .",
    "[ eq : clt_fmgeneral]-[eq : fitparameters ] ) are fixed quantities in any given frame . in a _",
    "pair_-dependent frame ( e.g. lcms ) , the total energy and momentum of the event will fluctuate , pair - by - pair . thus , while the correlation function may be _ binned _ in whatever frame one chooses , the momenta @xmath133 on the right side of eqs .",
    "[ eq : jyo1]-[eq : fitparameters ] must be calculated in a pair - independent frame .",
    "in fact , starting with equation  [ eq : comframe ] , we have chosen the ccm , for simplicity .",
    "the parameters @xmath134 defined in equation  [ eq : fitparameters ] , on the other hand , are global and independent of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "it is these which we will use as fit parameters .",
    "the task is then fast and straightforward ; the emcic part of the correlation function @xmath135 is simply a weighted sum of four functions .",
    "indeed , one may calculate coefficients as in equation  [ eq : alm ] for the four new functions .",
    "for example @xmath136 etc .",
    "then , thanks to the linearity of equation  [ eq : formula ] and the orthonormality of @xmath137 s , the measured s themselves are similarly just weighted sums of harmonics @xmath138 treating equation  [ eq : almfit ] as a fit , we have a few ( say six , for @xmath139 ) _ one_-dimensional functions to fit with four adjustable weights .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in this four - parameter fit remains high : @xmath140 , for six s , each with 50 bins in @xmath141 .",
    "correlation function , in the pair rest frame , from 18-pion genbod  -generated events . the black curve is a result of a fit with the `` experimentalist s formula '' from equation  [ eq : almfit ] .",
    "other curves represent the three component terms of the fit : @xmath142 in the brown dotted line ; @xmath143 in the blue dashed line ; @xmath144 in the red dash - dot line .",
    "see text for details.[fig : fitalmgenbod],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an example is shown in figure  [ fig : fitalmgenbod ] , where genbod  -calculated correlation functions are fitted with the form of equation  [ eq : almfit ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the minimization procedure returned fit parameters @xmath134 very close to the values calculated via equation  [ eq : fitparameters ] .",
    "however , exact agreement between the `` best '' parameter values returned by the fit , and those from equation  [ eq : fitparameters ] is not expected .",
    "this is because the large-@xmath2 approximation is only approximately valid and due to the fact that @xmath145 , as discussed previously . treating the @xmath134 as adjustable parameters leads to a slightly different weighting of the terms , and a slightly better fit to the data .",
    "our original goal was not to understand emcics _ per se _ , but to extract the femtoscopic information from measured two - particle correlations . assuming that the only non - femtoscopic correlations are emcics",
    ", one may simply add the femtoscopic terms @xmath146 to the fitting function in equation  [ eq : formula ] or  [ eq : almfit ] .",
    "@xmath147    common femtoscopic fitting functions ( e.g. gaussian in the out - side - long space ) usually contain @xmath148 parameters ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) . in the imaging technique",
    "@xcite , one assumes the separation distribution is described by a sum of splines , rather than a gaussian ; here , too , there are usually 4 - 5 fit parameters ( spline weights ) .",
    "so , by including emcic effects , we have roughly doubled the number of fit parameters , relative to a `` traditional '' fit which ignores them .",
    "this is a non - trivial increase in analysis complexity .",
    "however , we keep in mind two points .",
    "firstly , the increased effort is simply necessary .",
    "emcics ( and possibly other important non - femtoscopic correlations ) are present and increasingly relevant at low multiplicity .",
    "one option is to ignore them , as has sometimes been done in early high - energy experiments .",
    "however , with the new high - quality data and desire for detailed understanding at rhic , ignoring obvious features such as those presented in  @xcite is clearly unacceptable .",
    "perhaps a slightly better option is to invent an ad - hoc functional form  @xcite without a strong real physical basis .",
    "we hope that the results here present a relatively painless and more reasonable , third option .    secondly , while the non - femtoscopic emcics are not confined to the large-@xmath38 region ( an important point ! ) , the femtoscopic correlations are confined to the small-@xmath38 region .",
    "therefore , one hopes that the addition of four new parameters to the fit of the correlation function will not render the fit overly unwieldy .",
    "while we can not expect complete block - diagonalization of the fit covariance matrix , one hopes that the @xmath134 are determined well enough at high @xmath38 that the femtoscopic fit parameters can be extracted at low @xmath38 .",
    "for at least two reasons , it is important to turn attention to correlations between non - identical particles .",
    "first , it is natural to ask whether one can use other particle combinations to `` correct '' for effects of emcics in , say , identical - pion correlation functions .",
    "after all , emcics are induced by global constraints on the entire event , not a specific particle species .",
    "for example , various experiments have explored using @xmath152 correlations to account for emcics in @xmath153 correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "second , it is also important to know whether emcics could cloud the interpretation of correlations between non - identical particles .",
    "it is increasingly common to study asymmetries in the correlation functions of , say @xmath154 pairs  @xcite , interpreting such as a `` shift '' in the average point of emission between the two particles  @xcite . in the spherical harmonic decomposition ,",
    "such shifts appear in the @xmath155 moments ( c.f .",
    "appendix  [ app : symmetries ] ) .",
    "we will find that emcics can indeed generate an asymmetry which might naively be considered proof of a femtoscopic shift .    here",
    "we discuss two effects one immediately obvious and one more subtle which are relevant for the above issues .",
    "the discussion is broken into three parts .",
    "neglecting emcics and any other source of correlation at first , we briefly show the effects of two common resonances on correlations between oppositely - charged pions in a toy model .",
    "thus calibrated , we use the more realistic and complex pythia  model to illustrate a non - trivial interplay between emcics and the resonances , which can mock up a femtoscopic asymmetry signal . finally , we return to a toy model now with non - identical particles and emcics , but without resonances or the several other sources of correlation present in pythia   to make clear the mechanism behind the special effects emcics have on non - identical particle correlations .",
    "first we consider the effect of resonances . to focus on effects other than global emcics",
    "we use a toy model in which only ten identical resonances per event are generated and no other particles .",
    "the momentum of each resonance is generated from a thermal distribution ; energy and momentum are conserved for each decay separately , but not globally for the whole event .    figure  [ fig : omegarholcms ] shows the spherical harmonic moments of @xmath156 correlation functions for events including @xmath157 ( blue squares ) and @xmath158 resonances ( red triangles ) .",
    "correlation functions calculated in the lcms frame for events including @xmath157 ( blue squares ) and @xmath158 ( red triangles ) resonances .",
    "[ fig : omegarholcms],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as seen , even without considering emcics , the correlations among particles coming from resonance decays produce non - trivial structure . in this case",
    ", one can not simply divide @xmath159 correlation function by @xmath156 to `` remove '' emcics .     correlation function from @xmath0 and @xmath160 collisions at 200  gev calculated from pythia  events .",
    "[ fig : pythianonid],scaledwidth=49.0% ]      in addition to the correlation between daughters of resonance decays ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : omegarholcms ] ) , there is a more subtle effect to consider .",
    "this happens when the two particles have different inclusive momentum distributions _ and _ energy and momentum are globally conserved . under these conditions",
    "non - identical particle correlations exhibit structure absent in identical particle correlations .",
    "figure  [ fig : pythianonid ] shows pythia  @xcite calculations of @xmath156 correlations for @xmath0 and @xmath160 collisions at 200 gev .",
    "in addition to obvious correlations between daughters of resonance decays ( @xmath161 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 ) , we see additional structure .",
    "we focus on the structure in the @xmath155 moments . in general ,",
    "such moments need not vanish for correlations of non - identical particles , as discussed in appendix  [ app : symmetries ] .",
    "correlations between sibling daughters of @xmath158 and @xmath157 resonance decay do not generate @xmath155 moments , as seen in section  [ sec : toymodel ] .",
    "however , pions which are daughters of these decays will in general have a different single - particle momentum distribution than pions from other sources in the event .",
    "if the fraction of pions from resonance decay , as a function of pion momentum , is different for @xmath87 and @xmath86 , then the single - particle distributions of positive and negative pions will be different .",
    "we argue below that it is this difference in single - particle distributions which is the key to the non - vanishing @xmath155 moments ; that this difference may arise from resonances in the case at hand is irrelevant .",
    "in the @xmath160 collisions , the fraction of @xmath87 coming from any given source ( e.g. @xmath158-decay ) must be identical to that of @xmath86 , for a given value of @xmath3 .",
    "thus the @xmath3 distribution of @xmath86 must be identical to that of @xmath87 .",
    "however , the rapidity distributions will be mirror images of each other .",
    "thus , any asymmetry in @xmath162 correlations from @xmath160 collisions will be associated with @xmath163 , and will appear in @xmath164 , as seen in figure  [ fig : pythianonid ] .",
    "similarly , the vanishing ( non - vanishing ) moment @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) for @xmath0 collisions reflects the fact the single - particle distributions will show no asymmetry in rapidity , but may differ as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "since single - particle distributions divide out of a correlation function , a difference between @xmath87 and @xmath86 momentum distributions , by itself , can not generate a signal in s .",
    "rather , a global correlation , coupled with this difference , generates the signal .",
    "we discuss this further below .      in section  [ sec : entrancechannel ] , we argued that the small difference in single - particle momentum distributions between positive and negative pions produced by pythia  , coupled with global conservation laws , generated non - trivial emcics in the non - identical particle correlations .",
    "however , pythia  contains many non - emcic sources of correlations , related to string fragmentation and other processes , which might be flavor / isospin - dependent . to make clearer our argument",

    "@xmath165 is finite , however , due to differences in @xmath3 distributions .",
    "since there is no other source of correlation in the simulation , this obviously is an emcic .    from figure",
    "[ fig : genbodnonidpaircms ] it is also clear that neither equation  [ eq : jyoc2 ] nor its first - order expansion  [ eq : jyoc2firstorder ] fully describes the correlation function .",
    "this is due to the fact that our formalism is built on the assumption that all particles in the system follow the same parent distribution , as pointed out after equation  [ eq : definerms ] .",
    "to truly claim an understanding of the bulk nature of matter at rhic and the lhc , a detailed picture of the dynamically - generated geometric substructure of the system created in heavy ion collisions is needed .",
    "it is believed that this substructure , and the matter itself , is dominated by strong collective flow .",
    "the most direct measure of this flow is a measurement of the space - momentum correlation ( e.g. @xmath169 ) it generates .",
    "the physics of this large system , and the signals it generates , should be compared to the physics dominating @xmath0 collisions , as is increasingly important in high-@xmath3 studies at rhic . for small systems , however , non - femtoscopic effects contribute significantly to the correlation function , clouding the extraction and interpretation of femtoscopic ones . we have discussed a spherical harmonic representation of the correlation function which clearly separates components of the three - dimensional shape measured in modern experiments .",
    "this representation is maximally efficient , inasmuch as only a few one - dimensional plots need be examined to extract full 3-d shape information .",
    "the relevant number of such plots is further reduced due to symmetry conditions , discussed in detail in appendix  [ app : symmetries ] .",
    "emcics , correlations generated by kinematic conservation laws , are surely present and increasingly relevant as the event multiplicity is reduced . using the code genbod  to study correlation functions solely driven by emcics , we found highly non - trivial three - dimensional structures strongly influenced by event characteristics ( multiplicity and energy ) and kinematic particle selection .",
    "we extended the work of danielewicz , ollitrault and borghini to include four - momentum conservation and applied it to correlation functions commonly used in femtoscopy .",

    ", 3-d asymmetries ( sometimes quantified as `` double ratios '' , e.g.  @xcite ) in the correlation function for different - mass particles ( e.g. @xmath154 ) are often interpreted in terms of dynamically - generated differences in the average space - time emission point between the two particles . using a very simple example",

    "when calculating flow from two - particle correlations we have the following relations @xmath172 where for @xmath5 , @xmath173 .",

    "we then use a symmetry of the spherical harmonics , here @xmath184 to find @xmath185 thus , all odd-@xmath40 moments must vanish , for correlations between identical particles .",
    "the same type of reasoning is used below , in identifying symmetry constraints for various combinations of analysis conditions .",
    "table  [ tab : qtransformations ] lists all combinations in which one or more of the components of @xmath26 can change sign . for later reference ,",
    "the transformations are numbered 0  7 , according to a binary scheme .",
    "the effect of the transformation on the spherical harmonics appears in the last column of the table .",
    ".the possible transformations ( numbered in the left column ) in which the signs of @xmath26 components flip , and the effect of the transformation on the s . [ tab : qtransformations ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      under which of the transformations in table  [ tab : qtransformations ] does the correlation function remain invariant ?",
    "since identical - particle correlations are more common than correlations between non - identical particles , there will be a greater familiarity with the symmetries of the former .",
    "thus , we begin with this more familiar case and then discuss non - identical particle correlations .      to systematically identify those transformations in table  [ tab : qtransformations ] which leave a correlation function invariant , it helps to have a concrete functional form to discuss . for identical pions , the correlation function is often parameterized as a gaussian with six `` radius '' parameters , @xmath186 while measured correlation functions often have non - gaussian features not captured by this parameterization , the form given in equation  [ eq : idgaussian ] contains the generic and most general symmetries of all correlation functions using identical particles .",
    "thus , we use this familiar example to focus the discussion .",
    "the six parameters of form  [ eq : idgaussian ] describe an ellipsoid described by three axis lengths , and rotated by three euler angles in @xmath26-space .",
    "measured examples are shown and discussed in  @xcite .    clearly , the form of equation  [ eq : idgaussian ] is invariant under transformation ( 7 ) , as discussed earlier .",
    "invariance under any transformations ( 1)-(6 ) requires that one or more of the `` radius '' parameters @xmath187 vanish . in general ,",
    "none of them do  @xcite , even when considering a region symmetric about midrapidity in a collision between identical ions ( condition  [ cut : midrapidity ] )  at first , it seems surprising that , in the absence of reaction - plane assumptions , no additional symmetry constraint is imposed onto the correlation function by a symmetric selection about midrapidity i.e. none of the `` radius '' parameters @xmath187 are required to vanish .",
    "however , the selection does impose symmetry constraints at a `` higher '' level . in identical - particle correlations , for example ,",
    "while @xmath188 need not vanish at midrapidity for any given measured correlation function , symmetry demands a relationship between @xmath188 measured in different correlation functions ; in particular @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the angle between the total pair momentum and the reaction plane .",
    "symmetries at this level are discussed in detail in  @xcite . ] .",
    "if the measurement is integrated over reaction plane angle , then the `` side '' direction has no relevant sign , @xmath191 , and the correlation function is invariant under transformation ( 2 ) . while need not vanish  @xcite , the correlation function is unchanged if and change sign together ( transformation ( 5 ) ) .    further constraining the measurement to a symmetric region about midrapidity implies also that @xmath192 vanish , and the correlation function is then invariant under all transformations ( 0)-(7 ) .",
    "this is the most common set of measurement conditions .    at high energies ,",
    "it is common only to determine the second - order reaction plane .",
    "this corresponds to condition  [ cut : rp2 ] .",
    "if the measurement is performed at midrapidity ( condition  [ cut : y=0 ] ) , then is the only non - vanishing cross - term radius , so the correlation function is invariant under transformation ( 1 ) .",
    "away from midrapidity , need not vanish , so ( 7 ) is again the only remaining transformation leaving @xmath135 invariant .",
    "correlations between non - identical particles are no longer invariant under transformation ( 7 ) , as they may depend on odd - power terms of the components of @xmath26 . in the case of femtoscopic correlations , the strengths of these odd powers probe asymmetries in the average emission point between the two particle species  @xcite .    from a symmetry standpoint ,",
    "the correlation function will be characterized by nine parameters , rather than the six `` hbt radii '' of equation  [ eq : idgaussian ] . in the simple case that @xmath193 would be gaussian",
    ", these new parameters might represent the offset from the origin of the ellipsoid in @xmath26-space .    in the absence of any cuts or",
    "if only the midrapidity condition  [ cut : midrapidity ] is applied  [ [ fn : midrapiditysurprise ] ] , all nine parameters may take any value , and there are no required invariances or symmetry constraints .",
    "if the reaction - plane is integrated over ( condition  [ cut : norp ] ) then @xmath193 may remain sensitive to the sign of  ( reflecting , for example , a different average time of emission between the particles  @xcite ) and  ( reflecting the difference in emission point in the beam direction , for analyses away from midrapidity ) , but not , since an angle - averaged physical source must be symmetric with respect to the beam axis .",
    "unlike the case in which it is the sole condition , if the midrapidity condition  [ cut : midrapidity ] is imposed _ together _ with condition  [ cut : norp ] , then it does have an effect . in particular ,",
    "a dependence on the sign of vanishes .",
    "if condition  [ cut : norp ] is relaxed to condition  [ cut : rp2 ] ( i.e. the analysis is sensitive to the second - order reaction plane ) , then the sign of   may matter .",
    "this is because the sign of  always affects correlations between non - identical particles and , as in identical particle correlations in which  may be finite , so the sign of @xmath194 may separately matter .",
    "thus , imposition of [ cut : rp2 ] alone implies no symmetry constraints .",
    "equation  [ eq : alm ] defines the harmonic moments in terms of a continuous correlation function .",
    "most experimentally - measured correlation functions are constructed via histograms with discrete , finite bins . for decomposition into spherical harmonics",
    ", a natural choice would be to use bins in @xmath38 , @xmath195 and @xmath23 ( c.f . eq .",
    "[ eq : shdcoords ] ) . here , we will find an approximate expression , analogous to equation  [ eq : alm ] , for the harmonic moments in terms of the discretized correlation function .",
    "we denote the fixed bin sizes in the angular coordinates as @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "binning in @xmath38 is unimportant here , since @xmath38 is carried as an explicit argument in both @xmath198 and .",
    "the binned correlation function ( denoted with superscript @xmath166 ) is related to the continuous one as @xmath199      assuming that s vanish for @xmath201 greater than the sampling nyquist frequency , by the sampling theorem  @xcite , the s are completely determined by @xmath202 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath203 were independent of @xmath204 , then we would have @xmath205 where the summation is over all bins of @xmath195 and @xmath23 , for a given @xmath38 .",
    "for any given measurement , one may check the validity of this approximation by plugging the result of equation  [ eq : approxbinningcorrection ] into the expression on the last line of equation  [ eq : binning ] . to the extent that it returns the measured correlation function @xmath202 ,",
    "the s returned by equation  [ eq : approxbinningcorrection ] are correctly extracted",
    ". if there are deviations , the correct s can be found by iterative techniques ."
