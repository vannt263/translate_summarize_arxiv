    "there is a continued interest in improving time resolution of scintillator detectors .",
    "such improvements are especially challenging in case of the registration of low energy gamma quanta where the time resolution is limited by the low statistics of scintillation photons .",
    "superior time resolution for registration of low energy gamma quanta is of crucial importance in the nuclear medicine applications as e.g. in positron emission tomography ( pet ) , where the new generation of pet scanners utilizes for the image reconstruction differences between time of flight ( tof ) of annihilation quanta from the annihilation vertex to the detectors ( conti , humm et al , karp et al , townsend , moses derenzo , moses , conti eriksson ) .    in order to improve the tof resolution and to increase a geometrical acceptance of the pet scanners we are developing a j - pet detection system ( moskal et al , raczynski et al ) .",
    "the system is based on long strips of plastic scintillators which are characterized by better timing properties than the inorganic scintillator crystals used in the state of the art pet scanners ( conti , humm et al , karp et al , townsend , )    , t@xmath1 , t@xmath2 , t@xmath3 ) .",

    "[ barrel ] shows a schematic view of two detection modules of the   j - pet detector , where ( similarly as described in the reference  ( nickles et al ) ) the time of the interaction ( hit - time ) of gamma quantum in the scintillator ( @xmath8 ) is calculated as an arithmetic mean of times at left ( @xmath9 ) and right ( @xmath10 ) side of the strip .",
    "the position of interaction along the strip ( axial hit position ) may be in the first approximation calculated as @xmath11 = ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 / 2 , where @xmath13 denotes the speed of light signals in the scintillator strip .",
    "for example for plastic strips with cross section of 0.5  cm x 1.9  cm the effective light signal velocity is equal to @xmath13  =  12.2  cm / ns  ( moskal et al ) .",
    "thus , in the case of strips with the length of 30  cm characterized with the hit - time resolution of 0.188  ns ( fwhm ) the axial position resolution amounts to about 2.3  cm ( fwhm )  ( moskal et al ) .",
    "the position along the line - of - response ( @xmath14 ) between two strips ( e.g. up and down shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ barrel ] ) is calculated as ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the speed of light . the hit - time and hence also axial position resolution",
    "may still be improved e.g. by probing photomuliplier pulses in the voltage domain by a newly developed electronics  ( palka et al ) , and by applying in the reconstruction the compressing sensing theory  ( raczynski et al , ) and the library of synchronized model signals  ( moskal et al ) . the timing resolution , as it is introduced hereafter in this article , can be also improved by making a readout allowing to record time - stamps from larger number of photons compared to the case of the vacuum tube photomultipliers . due to the relatively low costs of plastic scintillators and their large light attenuation length ( in the order of 100  cm ) it is possible to construct a detector with a long axial field - of - view in a cost effective way .",
    "this feature makes the j - pet detector competitive to the present solutions as regards the whole - body imaging .",
    "one of the possible arrangements of the scintillator strips in the j - pet scanner is visualized in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ barrel ] . such alignment permits to use more than one detection layer thus increasing the efficiency of gamma quanta registration .",
    "plastic scintillators were not used so for as possible detectors for pet imaging due to the negligible probability of the photoelectric effect and lower detection probability with respect to the inorganic crystals . with the plastic scintillators the detection of 0.511 mev gamma quanta",
    "is based in practice only on the compton scattering . in fig .",
    "[ comptons ] we show a distribution of compton scattered electron energy for ( i ) the energy of gamma quanta reaching the detector without scattering in the patient s body , ( ii ) after the scattering through an angle of 30 degrees and ( iii ) after scattering through an angle of 60 degrees .",
    "the presented distributions show that in order to limit registration of gamma quanta scattered in the patient to the range from 0 to about 60 degrees ( as it was applied earlier e.g. in some lso or bgo based tomographs  ( humm et al ) ) , one has to use an energy threshold of about 0.2 mev  ( moskal et al ) .",
    "the scatter fraction can be further reduced at the expense of the sensitivity , yet it should be noted that its suppression to the level achievable in the newest lso based scanners with the energy window of 0.440 - 0.625 mev ( surti et al ) is questionable .",
    "however , for the quantitative statement , more detailed investigations are needed .",
    "( moskal et al ) . [ comptons ] ]",
    "application of 0.2  mev threshold suppresses also to the negligible level signals due to the secondary compton scattering in the detector material  ( kowalski et al ) .",
    "so far we have obtained 0.188  ns ( @xmath17 ) of hit - time resolution for the registration of 0.511  mev annihilation quanta by means of 30  cm long strips of plastic scintillators read out at both ends by vacuum tube photomultipliers  ( moskal et al ) .",
    "the experiment was performed using a collimated beam of annihilation quanta from the @xmath18 isotope placed inside a lead collimator with a 1.5  mm wide and 20  cm long slit .",
    "a dedicated mechanical system allowed us to irradiate the tested scintillator at the desired position .",
    "a coincidence registration of signals from the tested module and the reference detector on the other side of the collimator ensured selection of annihilation gamma quanta .",
    "a tested module consisted of a bc-420 plastic scintillator  ( ) with dimensions of 0.5  cm x 1.9  cm x  30  cm connected optically at the ends to the hamamatsu photomultipliers r5230  ( ) . the experimental setup and results of the measurements are described in detail in reference  ( moskal et al ) . in principle , information about a time of interaction of gamma quantum in the scintillator is carried by all emitted scintillation photons .",
    "however , in practice in the typical detectors , only few first registered photons , contributing to the leading edge of the electrical signal generated by the photoelectric converters , are utilized in the determination of the onset of these signals and hence in the determination of the time of the gamma quantum interaction .",
    "this is also the case for the scintillator strips in the current version of the j - pet detector ( see upper part of fig .  [ detector ] ) , where the time of the interaction is determined as an arithmetic mean of times at which electric signals generated by photomultipliers attached to both ends cross a preset threshold voltage .",
    "therefore , the time resolution may be improved by making a readout allowing to record timestamps from larger number of photons arriving at the scintillator edge .",
    "there are first attempts to register all timestamps using arrays of single - photon avalanche diodes ( meijlink et al ) , but presently the registration of arrival time of all photons with a good time resolution at large areas is still rather impractical .",
    "it is , however , important to stress that the intrinsic timing resolution limit is approached already when using only about 20 timestamps from first detected photons ( seifert et al ) .     ]    in this article we study the possibility of improving the time resolution for the large size detectors ( few tens of centimeters ) by registration of timestamps from several photons .",
    "this may be realized by preparing a readout in the form of an array with several sipm photomultipliers as it is indicated in the lower part of fig  [ detector ] .",
    "in such a case , a set of all registered photons is divided into several subgroups and a time of the registration of the first photon in each subgroup is recorded .",
    "this allows to construct estimators of the time of gamma quantum interaction based on the number of timestamps equal to the number of sipm photomultipliers .    in the following sections , first we estimate time resolution limits for infinitesimally small detector making an idealistic assumption that the time of arrival of each photon can be measured and used for the estimation of the time of gamma quantum interaction .",
    "we use fisher information from all emitted photons and calculate the cramr - rao lower limit ( seifert et al , de  grot ) which is independent of the estimator used for the time resolution determination .",
    "such estimations of the lower bound for the time resolution have been published recently ( seifert et al ) for small size crystals , taking into account the transit time spread of photomultipliers and neglecting the spread of the transit time inside scintillators . in this article",
    "we extend these investigations to the plastic scintillators strips with the length of up to 100  cm and include in the estimations the transit time spread due to the propagation of photons in scintillator strips as well as the transit time spread of photomultipliers .",
    "further on we determine the lower bounds for the time resolution using a weighted mean of timestamps as an estimator of the time of the gamma quantum interaction .",
    "next , we describe parameters used in the realistic simulations , including time distribution of photons emitted in ternary plastic scintillators , losses and time spread of photons due to their propagation through the scintillator , as well as quantum efficiency and transit time spread of photomultipliers .",
    "we test the simulation procedures by comparing simulated and experimental results for the bc-420 plastic scintillator read out at two ends by hamamatsu r5320 photomultipliers .",
    "section [ mainsection ] contains description of the main idea of this article where the estimator of the time of the gamma quantum interaction is defined based on the time ordered set including timestamps from first photons registered by the matrix of sipm converters . in this section",
    "we perform realistic simulations for the bc-420 scintillator strip and various configurations for the arrays of s12572 - 100p hamamatsu silicon photomultipliers .",
    "finally we estimate time resolution as a function of the scintillator length for the multi - sipm readout allowing to determine timestamps of 20 photons .",
    "the results are compared to the resolutions achievable with the traditional readout with the vacuum tube photomultipliers .",
    "the light yield of plastic scintillators amounts to about 10000 photons per 1  mev of deposited energy .",
    "annihilation gamma quanta ( 0.511  mev ) used for the positron emission tomography interact with plastic scintillators predominantly via compton scattering ( szymanski et al ) , and therefore may deposit maximally an energy of 0.341  mev ( 2/3 of electron mass ) .",
    "this corresponds to the emission of about 3410 photons . on the other hand , in order to decrease the noise due to the scattering of gamma quanta inside a patient body a minimum energy deposition of about 0.2  mev is required ( moskal et al ) .",
    "therefore , number of emitted photons discussed hereafter in this article includes the range from 2000 to 3410 photons .",
    "a single detection module considered in this article consists of the plastic scintillator strip connected at two ends to photomultipliers ( see fig .  [ detector ] ) .",
    "we assume that the gamma quantum or any other particle of interest interacts in the scintillator at time  @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the resolution for the reconstruction of the value of @xmath19 based on time measurement of signals generated by photosensors attached to two scintillator ends . for practical reasons ,",
    "if applicable , we use notation analogous to the one introduced in references ( seifert et al ) .    in general , timestamps of all photons detected at the left ( @xmath20 ) and at the right side ( @xmath21 ) of the scintillator",
    "may be used for the estimation of the time of the interaction @xmath19 .",
    "it is advantageous to order the sets of timestamps according to ascending time such that : ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 ) , where indices in brackets indicate timestamps from the ordered set . the @xmath24 element in the ordered set is referred to as i - th order statistic ( seifert et al ) .",
    "after ordering , the timestamps on one side become correlated but the ordered set allows for the simple and intuitive estimation of time difference between the signal arrivals to the ends of the scintillator : @xmath25 as well as interaction time @xmath19 which may be estimated by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is subject to calibration and for simplicity , but without loss of generality , it will be omitted in the further considerations .",
    "distributions of ordered timestamps at one side ( e.g. @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) are correlated and not identical .",
    "however , distributions for the same order statistics at left and right side ( @xmath28 and @xmath31 ) are uncorrelated since the ordering at left side was done independently of the ordering at right side .",
    "hence , it follows that variances of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 may be expressed as : @xmath34 @xmath35 the above equations imply that : @xmath36 we have checked this supposition by numerical simulations for the probability density distributions of emission times considered in this article . therefore , as regards the variance , it is sufficient to study properties of only one of these estimators .",
    "moreover , in order to facilitate direct comparison with results published in the field of tof - pet we will express resolution as fwhm of coincidence resolving time ( crt ) , where coincidence resolving time determined for i - th order statistic will be referred to as crt@xmath37 .",
    "it should be , however , noted that in general , even though @xmath28 and @xmath31 are uncorrelated , the @xmath32 and @xmath33 may be correlated since cov(@xmath32,@xmath33 ) = ( @xmath38 - @xmath39)/2 is equal to zero only if the emission point is in the center of the detector because only in this case the @xmath28 and @xmath31 are identically distributed .    in next sections",
    "we define the emission time distribution for the plastic scintillators and estimate the cramr - rao lower limit for the achievable time resolution .",
    "further on we will simulate time resolution for each order statistics @xmath32 separately , and we will test the variance of the weighted mean of @xmath32 values showing that such estimator of @xmath40 allows to reach significantly better resolution than achievable with single order statistics .",
    "in case of the ternary plastic scintillators , as e.g. bc-420 ( ) and its equivalent ej-230 ( ) used in the j - pet detector , the distribution of the time of the photon emission followed by the interaction of the gamma quantum at time  @xmath19 can be well approximated by the following convolution of gaussian and exponential terms ( moszynski bengtson ):",
    "@xmath41 where the gaussian term with the standard deviation  @xmath42 reflects the rate of energy transfer to the primary solute , whereas @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the average time of the energy transfer to the wavelength shifter , and decay time of the final light emission , respectively ( moszynski bengtson ) .",

    "the time resolution achievable with the scintillator detectors is limited by the optical and electronic time spread caused by the detector components , and by the time distribution of photons contributing to the formation of electric signals .",
    "the latter depends on the number of registered photons and is referred to as the photon counting statistics ( seifert et al )",
    ". limitations of the time resolution due to the photon counting statistics have been studied in detail e.g. in refs .",

    "a detailed elaboration of the lower bound for time resolution has been published for most kinds of available crystal scintillators ( seifert et al ) .",

    "a comparison with the corresponding lower limit implies that there is still room for the substantial improvement of the time resolution . in the next sections we will present a novel solution which allows to improve the time resolution by more than a factor of 1.5",

    "the shown ratio is determined for a fixed afov  =  20  cm of the lso based pet , but varying the afov of the j - pet detector .",

    "[ r - fom ] indicates that in order to compensate for the lower efficiency of plastic scintillators and thus to obtain @xmath80 of the j - pet comparable to the lso based scanners with afov  =  20  cm it is required to use either two detection layers or to increase the j - pet afov to about 50  cm .",
    "certainly the @xmath80 of the lso based pet would also grow approximately as square of afov but at the same time the cost of such pet detector would increase almost linearly proportional to afov , whereas the cost of the j - pet does not increase significantly when increasing the afov .",
    "the relative ease of the cost effective increase of the axial field - of - view makes the j - pet tomograph competitive with respect to the current commercial pet scanners as regards sensitivity and time resolution , yet this is achieved at the expense of the significant reduction of the axial spatial resolution .",

    "<S> , it is shown that the improvement of timing resolution saturates with the growing number of photomultipliers , and that the 2  x  5 configuration at two ends allowing to read twenty timestamps , constitutes an optimal solution . </S>",
    "<S> the conducted simulations accounted for the emission time distribution , photon transport and absorption inside the scintillator , as well as quantum efficiency and transit time spread of photosensors , and were checked based on the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> application of the 2  x  5 matrix of sipm allows for achieving the coincidence resolving time in positron emission tomography of @xmath0  0.170  ns for 15  cm axial field - of - view ( afov ) and @xmath0  0.365  ns for 100  cm afov . </S>",
    "<S> the results open perspectives for construction of a cost - effective tof - pet scanner with significantly better tof resolution and larger afov with respect to the current tof - pet modalities . </S>"
