    "others have been proposed , as e.g. osqar  @xcite and a pulsed laser experiment  @xcite .",
    "all of the ongoing experiments make use of the difference @xmath6 of the predicted refractive index changes for different angles of the magnetic field with respect to the polarization direction of the light , i.e. they attempt to measure the _ birefringence _ of the vacuum . in these experiments ,",
    "a laser beam resonating in a fabry - perot cavity passes a magnetic field , resulting in different refractive indices for the two orthogonal polarization directions .",
    "ellipsometers then measure a rotation of the polarization of the light as a measure of the vacuum birefringence . in pvlas and q&a a modulation of the _ angle _ of the magnetic field with respect to the polarization direction of the light is used ( and thus a modulation of the induced polarization rotation ) to suppress effects at low frequencies and isolate the measured signal from background noise .",
    "not yet understood excess noise from birefringence of highly - refractive mirrors has led to problems in the past , resulting in a ` signal ' above the expected qed signal e.g. in the pvlas experiment . while this could be explained later",
    ", the birefringence of highly reflective mirrors remains a problem to date , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the experimental upper limit for birefringence of the vacuum established by bmv  @xcite is still a factor of about 2000 away from the predicted value .",
    "the new pvlas experiment could recently significantly improve the upper limit to a factor of 50 above the prediction  @xcite .    while the pvlas experiment uses a static magnet ( e.g. a permanent magnet in the new design  @xcite ) , another approach gained momentum with the notion that higher magnetic fields , and thus larger signals , could be produced with pulsed magnets .",
    "pulsed magnets modulate the _ amplitude _ of the magnetic field , and thus - by nature of the pulses - provide a modulation to suppress background noise as well .",
    "askenazy et.al .",
    "were the first to propose a pulsed coil design for measurements of birefringence  @xcite .",
    "the bmv experiment  @xcite started using a pulsed coild design slightly different from this , called _ xcoil _",
    "@xcite , in order to approach the measurement of vacuum birefringence with pulsed magnets . as we will see below ,",
    "the larger signal from pulsed magnets has to be balanced against integration time .",
    "a different approach to the measurement of vacuum - qed effects was mentioned in  @xcite , namely to use laser interferometers for gravitational wave ( gw ) detection , to measure directly the _ velocity shift _ ( rather than the _ polarization shift _ ) of the light in the presence of a dedicated magnetic field .",
    "this may be the first time that gw detectors have been mentioned explicitly in this context , however the idea to measure the velocity shift of light in the presence of a magnetic field has been proposed several times earlier , as pointed out in an excellent overview article by battesti and rizzo  @xcite .",
    "a nice example of this is the paper by grassi strini , strini , and tagliaferri from 1979 , who already discussed the use of laser interferometers for vacuum - qed measurements  @xcite .",
    "the proposal to use gw detectors for qed measurements was also picked up in @xcite , where the authors come to the conclusion that prototype gw - interferometers would be more suitable than full - scale gw - detectors .",
    "however , this conclusion is incorrect due to a false assumption on how the interferometer displacement noise scales with an increase of arm - cavity finesse .",
    "later , zavattini and calloni , pointing out the error in @xcite , studied some implications of attempting vacuum - qed measurements for the case of the virgo interferometer  @xcite .",
    "they consider the use of dipole magnets to be used quasi - continuously at a fixed frequency , and put forward some more principal considerations of how such a magnet could be incorporated into the gw - detector .",
    "dbrich and gies  @xcite then proposed to use _ pulsed magnets _ to measure the velocity shift of the light in gravitational wave detectors .",
    "they point out that not only do pulsed magnets yield larger signals for the same amount of average energy driving the magnet , but also naturally can match the frequency response of gravitational wave detectors in a potentially favorable manner .",
    "i will get back to these considerations in section [ subsec_pulsed ] .",
    "table [ overviewtable ] shows an overview of existing or considered vacuum - qed measurements , arranged by the modulation method of the magnetic field and the measured quantity of the affected light .",
    "it was pointed out in particular by zavattini and calloni in  @xcite , that the independent measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath7 allows to distinguish between different possible particle models , in case a signal larger than the expected vacuum - qed effect would be observed .",

    ", this energy has to be brought into and removed from the aperture space 50 times per second , corresponding to an energy flow of almost 200kj / sec .",
    "electro - magnets , modulated in field amplitude , would allow for the measurement of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "linear conductors parallel to the laser beam tube are the most efficient way to generate a magnetic field perpendicular to the laser beam direction , a setup also used for beam deflection in particle accelerator magnets .",
    "figure  [ linear1 ] shows a principal setup of a linear magnet arranged alongside a laser beam tube .",
    "we start with the parameter estimation of such a linear conductor , by noting that we want to maximize the excitation @xmath10 , as defined in equation  [ excitation ] for any magnet design .",
    "[ excitation ] is to be resolved to the geometric parameters of the setup , material constants , and electrical power .",
    "we use the following equations : @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the effective current through the linear conductor with distance @xmath13 from the laser beam axis .",
    "this is an approximation assuming a conductor which is long in the laser beam direction , and has a small crossection compared to the dimensions of the beam tube in the plane perpendicular to the beam tube .",
    "the factor of two on the left side comes from counting the two conductors at each side of the beam tube .",
    "we then use the electrical power dissipation @xmath14 ( in the low frequency limit ) @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the total ohmic resistance of the linear conductor .",
    "finally we use @xmath17 to calculate the ohmic resistance of the conductor , with @xmath18 being the specific resistance of the conductor material and @xmath19 being the cross - section of the conductor  .",
    "combining equations ( [ eqa3 ] ) to ( [ eqa5 ] ) and inserting into ( [ excitation ] ) we obtain @xmath20 this result has the following implications for the magnet design :    * the length of the conductor @xmath21 has been eliminated and hence has no influence on the excitation strength ( for a given power , conductor cross - section , and beam tube diameter ) .",
    "note that this result can be used to adjust the maximal temperature as well as mechanical force on the conductors , as two technical constraints .",
    "* for a fixed tube diameter , the excitation increases with increasing conductor cross - section , up to practical limits not reflected in eq .",
    "[ eqa6 ] . in principle",
    "this can be used for the estimation of a quasi - optimal conductor cross - section . * increasing the electrical power @xmath14 and decreasing the resistance of the conductor material @xmath18 increase the excitation linearly . while copper is the obvious material of choice for the conductor , the power @xmath14 will be determined by heat dissipation and general power handling constraints of the setup . *",
    "similar to what was found in eq .",
    "[ eq_energy ] , the excitation decreases with the square of the distance @xmath13 to the application region , which thus should be as small as possible .    for a desired excitation of @xmath22 and an example conductor cross - section @xmath23 we obtain ( using eq .",
    "[ eqa6 ] ) a necessary power of @xmath24 .",
    "this is a rather large power and seems very impractical to realize .    a simulation with the finite - element simulator program _ femm _",
    "@xcite yields @xmath25 , roughly confirming the simplified calculation . just for illustration ,",
    "figure  [ mag1 ] shows the magnetic field lines for this simulation .",
    "however , this result is only valid for the low frequency limit , in particular at dc .",
    "while super - conducting magnets can lower the energy dissipation in the conductor due to the extremely low electrical resistance , they are not suitable for large and fast amplitude modulations of the magnetic field , as will be required for our application . therefore , we only consider copper as conductor material throughout this paper .",
    "for our example , we need to amplitude - modulate the drive current at a frequency @xmath26 . while the _ real _ power dissipation is largely un - affected from this ( neglecting skin- and proximity effects ) , the inductance of the setup results in very large _ reactive _ powers to be handled .",
    "the numerical calculation with femm yields a reactive power of @xmath27 , which very much complicates the electric drive circuit on top of the real power dissipation of the system as calculated above .    , but with the addition of ferro - magnetic material around the rectangular conductors and the central vacuum tube . ]    , but with the addition of ferro - magnetic material around the rectangular conductors and the central vacuum tube . ]",
    "if the peak magnetic fields are constrained to about 2 t , it can be considered to use a ferro - magnetic material to enhance the magnetic flux for a given magnetic setup .",
    "this has been simulated for the example above , adding a soft ferro - magnetic material ( us - steel type s-2 , with 0.018inch lamination ) in the femm simulation around the copper conductor , as depicted in figure  [ mag2 ] .",
    "the electrical drive power has been adjusted to again yield an excitation of @xmath22 .",
    "the simulation result is that in the low frequency limit the power is reduced to @xmath28 .",
    "if modulated at a frequency of @xmath26 the reactive power is now @xmath29 .",
    "this is better , but still seems far from practical to realize .      as will be shown in the following , continuous operation of an electro - magnet ( at a fixed frequency ) is not optimal . for the same average power",
    "@xmath14 applied to the magnet , the total integration time for a given snr can be reduced if the magnet is active only for fractions of time , intersperced by pauses .    if equation  [ inttime ] is combined with equation  [ eqa6 ] , we obtain @xmath30    we define @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the power applied to the magnet during a fraction @xmath33 of the time , such that the average power @xmath14 is kept constant .",
    "after a few steps we then get @xmath34    notably , this is the same result as in equation  [ eqa7 ] , except for the factor @xmath33 , which implicitly is @xmath35 for the case of continuous operation of the magnet .",
    "we see that the integration time is linearly reduced with the fraction of time that the magnet is engaged ( keeping the average power @xmath14 constant ) .",
    "this is the basic motivation to use a pulsed operation of electro - magnets in the first place .",
    "ultimately this technique is limited by the peak power and pulse energy that can be handled by the system , which is determined by the pressure on the conductors due to lorentz forces and by constraints in the electrical drive system .",
    "another limit on @xmath33 comes from the usable signal period @xmath36 , which preferably has to match the frequency of lowest noise of the gw detector , as relevant for our application .",
    "however besides these more technical constraints , we also have neglected so far the energy @xmath37 needed to build up the magnetic field .",
    "to include this energy into the calculation we split the total energy @xmath38 of a single pulse into the components due to electrical dissipation in the conductor @xmath39 and the energy in the magnetic field @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath40 we obtain : @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the inductance of the conductor setup , and @xmath43 being the length of the pulse . for a linear conductor setup according to figure  [ linear1 ]",
    "the inductance l can be approximated as @xmath44 . resolving equation [ eqa9 ] to the current @xmath12 , inserting into equations  [ eqa3 ] and then into  [ excitation ] , we obtain ( with also using equation  [ eqa5 ] ) : @xmath45    this result is equal to equation  [ eqa6 ] , if the constant term @xmath46 , which resembles the energy stored in the magnetic field , is neglected .",
    "the implications are :    * if the cross - section @xmath19 of the conductor is small , the energy dissipation @xmath39 will dominate over the energy @xmath47 in the magnetic field .",
    "this is a typical operation regime for most pulsed magnets . *",
    "if the pulse duration @xmath43 gets too short , @xmath47 will dominate over @xmath39 such that the excitation @xmath10 is not increasing any more for shorter pulses .",
    "* obviously the excitation @xmath10 scales with the total pulse energy @xmath48 , and inversely with the square of the system size @xmath13 .    a single pulse of length @xmath43 with energy @xmath48 results in a power @xmath49 .",
    "to keep the average power @xmath14 at a fixed lower level we apply pulses only every @xmath50 seconds , again with @xmath51 . in order to calculate integration times",
    "according to equation  [ inttime ] , we then have to use @xmath52    for a pulse energy of 1mj , an aperture radius of @xmath53 , a conductor cross - section of @xmath23 , and an average power of @xmath54 we calculate integration times for snr=1 as shown in figure  [ pulsed1 ] .",
    "a gw detector sensitivity of @xmath55 is used for all frequencies , in order to illustrate the effect of the energy in the magnetic field on the optimal pulse length  , has to be taken into account . ] .    , aperture radius @xmath53 , and a conductor cross - section of @xmath23 .",
    "a gw detector sensitivity of @xmath55 is used for all frequencies ]    for a pulse length of @xmath56 we get an integration time around 1 year , which means that about 600000 pulses would have to be applied . while the average power has been lowered compared to the examples above ,",
    "a pulse energy of 1mj is on the edge of current technology and is a very optimistic assumption given that the magnet for this application would still need to be developed .",
    "an energy of 1mj corresponds to 240 g of the explosive tnt .",
    "further , for the estimations in this section we have made simplifying assumptions , particularly not taking into account the following parameters : forces between the conductors and within the conductors , temperature rise of the conductor , skin effect , proximity effect , and complexities of the power supply .",
    "all these factors contribute to the complexity of ( pulsed ) magnet design , and typically make achieving the calculated performance demanding in practice .",
    "the use of pulsed magnets for vacuum - qed measurements at gw detectors was proposed and evaluated in ref .",
    "the estimation of integration times is more accurate in there , since the authors look at the full frequency spectrum of a signal pulse whereas we made simplifying assumptions in the estimation above .",
    "however , the authors in  @xcite concentrated on the principal ideas of the approach , and did not consider a possibly realistic experimental setup .",
    "one very optimistic assumption in their work is the estimation of an aperture diameter ( through which the laser beam passes ) of the magnetic field of order cm , which is the aperture available from pairs of pulsed helmholtz coils under development in the dresden high - field laboratory  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown above , a realistic assumption is a necessary aperture diameter of order 10 cm .",
    "this difference is the main single reason why the conclusion about the feasibility of using pulsed magnets for qed measurements at gw detectors is much more pessimistic in the estimation described in this section .",
    "the development of permanent magnet materials has made significant progress over the last decades , with the current maximum of a typical remanent magnetic flux density around @xmath57 for neodymium - iron - boron ( @xmath58 ) magnets .",
    "with superposition arrangements of individual magnet domains it is possible to obtain even larger magnetic field strengths , as for example with a halbach array  @xcite . if arranged in a _",
    "halbach cylinder _",
    "configuration , a uniform magnetic field within a hollow cylinder can be obtained , with its field lines oriented perpendicular to the cylinder axis . the new design of the pvlas experiment uses such halbach cylinders for the ellipsometric vacuum - qed measurement attempt  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ halbachcyl ] shows a halbach cylinder of length @xmath21 with an outer radius @xmath59 and a central opening of radius @xmath60 .",
    "the magnetic domain orientations are depicted on the left front face of the cylinder .",
    "the laser beam passes through the central opening , and the cylinder would be rotated around the laser beam axis , to provide spatial modulation of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath0 of a cylinder according to figure  [ halbachcyl ] can be approximated by @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the remanent field strength of the magnet material .",
    "such a magnet can be used to spatially modulate the magnetic field by rotation of the field around the laser beam , and thus measure @xmath63 . a magnet with excitation @xmath64",
    "could be constructed by choosing @xmath57 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "similar magnets have already been fabricated for the new pvlas experiment  @xcite , although with a smaller inner radius @xmath60 than for this application , where we are aiming for @xmath67 .",
    "another similar magnet , for an aperture radius of 13.5 mm , has been designed for the q&a experiment .",
    "this design is similar to a halbach cylinder , but also includes soft magnetic materials to increase the flux density towards the application region  @xcite .",
    "however , given the total mass of the assembly , there seems to be no significant advantage over the standard halbach cylinder design .",
    "an obvious large advantage of permanent- over electro - magnets is the fact that once the magnet has been constructed , there is no shifting of energy in- and out of the magnetic field required , and also no electrical power is dissipated in order to generate the field . with the magnet described here , rotating at @xmath26 around a gw detector laser beam with a displacement noise of @xmath68 , the integration time for n snr=1 would again be about 1 year .",
    "the disadvantage over electro - magnets is that in the setup using a single halbach cylinder , only @xmath63 can be measured .",
    "however , this could be overcome by using two halbach cylinders nested into each other .",
    "with such an arrangement it would be possible to amplitude - modulate the magnetic field inside the inner cylinder , simply by superposition of the fields of the two cylinders .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field lines stays constant and thus @xmath3 or @xmath4 can be measured individually .",
    "the relative forces between the two cylinders are small in the ideal case , where the outer fields are close to zero .",
    "whether this approach would be feasible in practice would need further investigation , and also depends on the rotation speed of the magnets .",
    "figure  [ layout1 ] shows a possible principal layout of a vacuum - qed measurement at the beam line of a gravitational wave detector .",
    "a section of the main beam tube is replaced with a non - conducting section with small aperture .",
    "this tube should be electrically non - conducting to avoid attenuation of the usable magnetic field by eddy - currents  , a non - ferro - magnetic steel tube of 5 mm wall strength would reduce the internal magnetic field by about 50% due to eddy currents . ] .",
    "eddy currents would also heat the tube , and could lead to undesired mechanical forces .",
    "seismically isolated baffles are proposed to prevent any light hitting the reduced beam tube , where scattering of laser light could produce excess noise in the gw detector readout  @xcite .",
    "the baffles should have a central opening that is slightly smaller ( e.g. by a few mm ) than that of the reduced beam tube , such that no light will hit the beam tube in the interaction region with the magnetic field . obviously , the baffle opening diameter is then the limiting aperture for the laser beam losses , and the amount by which this aperture is smaller than the beam tube diameter determines how well the alignment of baffle and beam tube has to be set and maintained against each other .",
    "the cotton - mouton effect ( cme )  @xcite of residual gas should be sufficiently low if the total pressure is held at less than @xmath69 , as far as the main constituents of air are concerned . with estimated cmes for molecular nitrogen and oxygen of @xmath70 and @xmath71 as taken from  @xcite , we approximate the cme for air ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) as @xmath74 . with a total pressure of @xmath69",
    "we obtain a contribution from residual air of @xmath75 , just below the expected qed effect as given in equation  [ eqdeltanpp ] .",
    "the cme for water in the gas phase has been measured in @xcite to @xmath76 , yielding a partial pressure of @xmath77 to be equal to the expected qed effect .    if a residual gas analyzer is used for permanent monitoring of the partial pressures , and the cmes of the residual gases are known sufficiently well , the estimated cme contributions can be subtracted from the vacuum qed signal thus increasing the significance with which a vacuum qed effect can be isolated",
    ".        the main constructional challenge would be the assembly and precise alignment of the reduced beam line setup and the suspended baffles .",
    "once this is done without degradation of the gw detector sensitivity , the magnet experimental setup should not interfere with the gw detector operations .",
    "as discussed above , the best option seems to be permanent magnets rotating around the beam axis . as planned for the new pvlas experiment",
    ", it is a good idea to use at least two magnets .",
    "this opens the possibility to make null - measurements , when the magnetic fields of the two magnets are kept perpendicular to each other during rotation , thus testing for systematic errors due to false signals . while more unlikely in a gw detector , such signals have been observed in the ellipsometric experiments as described in section  [ introduction ] . in gw detectors the interaction region with the magnetic field",
    "would typically be at the middle of the beam tube , thus of order @xmath78 away from the end stations holding the test - masses , which minimizes the risk of direct interaction of the magnetic field with the test masses or other components of the detection system .",
    "of course it is possible in principle that more systematic errors would be discovered during the experiment .",
    "systematic errors are commonly the biggest unknown in high - precision experiments , and have been slowing down the progress ( not only ) of other vacuum - qed projects . for example , vibrations of the beam tube at twice the magnet rotation frequency might be caused by ( inhomogeneous ) residual ferro - magnetic contamination or diamagnetism / paramgnetism of the beam tube material  .",
    "these vibrations could couple to the laser beam ( and thus may cause a spurious signal ) in principle , for example if the shielding of the gaussian tail of the laser beam by the baffles would not be sufficient .",
    "however , it would be possible to measure the vibration of the beam tube , and for an additional null - test , one could excite a similar beam tube motion as under magnet rotation , but without actually rotating the magnets .",
    "another possibility to exclude such an effect would be to compare ( qed- ) measurements under different conditions of mechanical damping of the beam tube .    in order to estimate a limit for the vibration of the baffles at the signal frequency",
    "one has to make an assumption on the scatter of light from the baffle into the main beam of the interferometer and compare its contribution to a putative qed signal .",
    "a very conservative estimate would be that a fraction @xmath79 of the main beam power would be scattered into the fundamental gaussian mode , corresponding to a fraction @xmath80 of the scattered light field amplitude .",
    "( note that less than 1ppm of power should be lost due to forward scattering and clipping at the baffle , as discussed in section  [ magnets ] .",
    "only a very small fraction of the clipped light can be scattered back into the fundamental laser mode in principle . )",
    "an excitation of @xmath81 makes a signal of about @xmath82 ( eq.[eqdeltanpp ] - [ pp - rms ] ) at frequency @xmath83 , corresponding to a phase shift of @xmath84 ( with @xmath85 being the wave - length of the light ) .",
    "therefore , the baffle motion at frequency @xmath83 should be less than @xmath86 . for a ( hypothetical ) motion of the baffle suspension point of order @xmath87 at frequency @xmath83",
    ", one would thus need 7 orders of magnitude of isolation from the baffle suspension .",
    "if we take @xmath88 as signal frequency , this is achievable with three stages of isolation ( for example one passive stack / rubber pre - isolation and a double pendulum suspension for the baffle . )",
    "it is hard to predict what vibration level one may get at the suspension point .",
    "however , this level can be measured precisely with accelerometers , and the baffle suspension point could also be artificially excited to estimate the amount of signal contribution from scattering at the baffle .",
    "regarding the magnet design , a calculation of excitation per unit of material cost shows that a ratio of @xmath65 is close to the optimum , as shown in figure  [ signalcost ] .     for a halbach cylinder as depicted in figure  [ halbachcyl ] .",
    "the maximum efficiency is around a ratio of 2.2 when only magnetic material and bearing cost are accounted for .",
    "additional cost of infrastructure that grows linear with length of beam tube occupied by the setup can lead to an optimal ratio of 3.5 - 5 . ]    for the bearing and rotational drive of the magnets , it seems best to use friction - less magnetic bearings  @xcite , which would be particularly helpful for the long integration times needed .",
    "the cost of such bearings roughly scales with the mass they can support , such that the cost optimization including bearings is the same as for magnet material only , as shown in figure  [ signalcost ] . as an example",
    ", one could use two magnets with excitation @xmath89 , and length @xmath90 each . for a ratio @xmath91 , and an inner radius of @xmath92 ,",
    "the mass of one magnet would be 328 kg and it would cost around $ 50000 at current material prices .",
    "for the two magnets , the integration time for a snr=1 would be t=1.07years . the situation gets better if the sensitivity of the gw detectors is improved in the future .",
    "for example , a displacement noise of @xmath93 at 50hz might be reached by a potential upgrade of advanced ligo ( see figure  [ alldetectors ] ) . together with increasing the number of magnets from 2 to 4 , the integration time for",
    "snr=1 would fall to t=17.7days , such that after 3 years of operation a reasonably good snr of 8 could be achieved for the basic qed effect .",
    "laser - interferometric gravitational wave detectors currently under construction or planned for the future offer the possibility of vacuum - qed measurements .",
    "we have shown the principal feasibility of this approach given the planned sensitivities and magnet technology , and derived new estimates of measurement times .",
    "we have compared three different kinds of source field magnets and conclude that from a realistic design perspective , permanent magnets are the best , or even the only , option for the time being",
    ". the main implementation work will come from the reduction of beam tube diameter , given the constraint to not disturb the gravitational - wave measurement capability of the instrument . even if vacuum - qed measurements would be successful by ellipsometric measurements within the next several years",
    ", the measurement of these effects with gw detectors is still valuable since it is based on a different measured quantity , the velocity shift of the light , and also has the potential to measure parameters of exotic particle models not accessible with ellipsometric measurements .",
