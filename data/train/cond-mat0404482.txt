    "<S> we observed a field - induced staggered magnetization in the 2d frustrated dimer singlet spin system srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 by @xmath2b nmr , from which the magnitudes of the intradimer dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction and the staggered @xmath3-tensor were determined . </S>",
    "<S> these anisotropic interactions cause singlet - triplet mixing and eliminate a quantum phase transition at the expected critical field @xmath4 for gap closing . </S>",
    "<S> they provide a quantitative account for some puzzling phenomena such as the onset of a uniform magnetization below @xmath4 and the persistence of the excitation gap above @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap was accurately determined from the activation energy of the nuclear relaxation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> spin systems with singlet ground states exhibit a variety of quantum phase transitions in magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a generic example is the bose - einstein condensation of triplets when the field exceeds the critical value at which the excitation energy vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an antiferromagnetic order with the staggered moment perpendicular to the field , as has been observed , e.g. , in tlcucl@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is the formation of a superlattice of localized triplets due to repulsive interactions , which translates into magnetization plateaus at fractional values of the saturated magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the best known example is srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 with its two - dimensional network of orthogonal dimers of cu@xmath5 ions ( spin 1/2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this material shows an excitation gap @xmath6=35  k and plateaus at 1/8 , 1/4 , and 1/3 of the saturated magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic superlattice at the 1/8-plateau has actually been observed by nmr experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ( bo@xmath1)@xmath0 viewed along ( a ) the @xmath7- ( @xmath8- ) and ( b ) the [ 1@xmath90]- ( @xmath10- ) directions . numbers are the site indices for both cu and b. symbols for @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate the direction of @xmath13 in the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction @xmath14 with the bond direction @xmath15 shown by arrows . ]    </S>",
    "<S> these basic properties can be explained by a heisenberg model on the frustrated shastry - sutherland lattice , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the intra- and interdimer exchange interactions as shown in a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , several aspects of low - temperature and high - field properties remain mysterious : i ) a finite magnetization appears well below the expected critical field for the gap closing @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath3-value along the field direction @xcite ; ii ) a gap seems to persist above @xmath4 @xcite ; iii ) there appears no phase transition down to @xmath21=0 at fields below the 1/8-plateau , which means that no bose condensation occurs , while one has been observed above it @xcite ; iv ) the magnetization shows a discontinuous jump at the lower boundary of the 1/8-plateau @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the properties i ) and ii ) suggest that triplet states are mixed into the ground state by some anisotropic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the _ interdimer _ </S>",
    "<S> dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and the sign alternates as shown in a , was required to explain the splitting of triplet energy levels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not have matrix elements between singlet and one - triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> although the _ intradimer _ dm interaction is a candidate , no estimate for its magnitude has been made so far .    in this letter , we report observation of a field - induced staggered magnetization by @xmath2b nmr experiments , which is also caused by singlet - triplet mixing . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative estimates of the intradimer dm interaction and the staggered @xmath3-tensor are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these anisotropic interactions provide quantitative accounts for the above points i ) and ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the behavior of the gap obtained from the nuclear relaxation rate upon entering into the 1/8-plateau .    </S>",
    "<S> a single crystal of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 was grown by the traveling - solvent - floating - zone method using libo@xmath24 solvent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr measurements below 18  t were performed at issp , university of tokyo , while data at higher fields were obtained using a 20mw resistive magnet at the grenoble high magnetic field laboratory .    </S>",
    "<S> we first describe the anisotropic interactions compatible with the crystal structure ( space group @xmath25 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial feature is the non - coplanar buckling of the magnetic cubo@xmath26 layers as depicted in b. this allows additional anisotropic interactions , @xmath27 where a ( b ) denotes dimers along the @xmath28- ( @xmath10 ) direction . the second term , the intradimer dm interaction , is allowed since the buckling breaks inversion symmetry at the center of dimer bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the first , zeeman term involves anisotropic @xmath3-tensors , which for site 1 is given by @xmath29 while @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are obtained from @xmath33 by symmetry operations of the crystal ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the @xmath34-component is opposite for @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath35 represents the staggered component . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal components were determined as @xmath36=@xmath37=2.05 and @xmath20=2.28 from esr measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath38=0.023 by assuming that the principal axis of @xmath33 coincides with that of the electric field gradient at cu1 nuclei ( 5.6@xmath39 from the @xmath7-axis @xcite ) , which is nearly perpendicular to the plane containing the four oxygen atoms surrounding one cu1 .    in magnetic fields , the anisotropic hamiltonian @xmath40 results in a non - collinear magnetization consisting of four sublattices @xmath41=@xmath42 ( @xmath43=1 to 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define the uniform and staggered moments on a and b dimers as @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal symmetry tells us that an external field @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) induces staggered moments @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such non - collinear moments , unobservable from bulk magnetization measurements , can be accurately detected by @xmath2b nmr . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic hyperfine field acting on a nuclear spin at site @xmath43 is expressed as @xmath53=@xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the hyperfine coupling tensor between the @xmath43-th nuclear spin and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of @xmath53 along @xmath57 , denoted as @xmath58 , is obtained from the shift of the nmr frequency .     at different temperatures in the external field of 6.948  t. ]    we first discuss the results for a small field ( 6.948  t ) rotated in the ( @xmath910)- ( @xmath34- ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr spectra consist of several sets of quadrupole - split lines . </S>",
    "<S> each set was assigned to a particular site based on the known anisotropy of the quadrupole splitting @xcite . in </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath60-dependence can be well fitted by a simple sinusoidal curve ( curves in ) , @xmath65 @xmath21-dependences of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are plotted in .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60-dependence of @xmath68 is not symmetric around @xmath69 , leading to a finite @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath70 and @xmath71 contribute to @xmath67 through the uniform ( diagonal ) and the staggered ( off - diagonal ) parts of the coupling @xmath55 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath71 and @xmath70 had the same @xmath21-dependence , this should stand for @xmath67 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed not the case , since @xmath67 extrapolates to a large finite value at @xmath21=0 , while @xmath66 almost vanishes similarly to the magnetic susceptibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that a sizable staggered moment @xmath70 is induced at @xmath21=0 at field values @xmath72 , while the uniform moment is nearly zero . </S>",
    "<S> this can be qualitatively explained by considering @xmath73 as a perturbation for an isolated dimer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath40 has matrix elements between singlet and triplets on the same dimer , triplets are mixed into the ground state , resulting in finite @xmath70 to first order in perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath71 is much smaller than @xmath70 , since only higher order terms contribute to @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> although field - induced staggered moments have been reported in the haldane chain compound nenp @xcite , this is the first observation in quasi 2d systems .    , @xmath67 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 at @xmath76=6.948  t. ]    for a quantitative analysis </S>",

    "<S> the sin@xmath84 dependence of @xmath68-@xmath85 in is reproduced if the moments vary as @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this is approximately confirmed by the numerical calculations presented below . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath88 combining these relations with , we obtain @xmath89    the analysis of the @xmath2b nmr spectrum in the 1/8-plateau phase @xcite indicates that all hyperfine couplings except @xmath78 are approximately given by the classical dipolar fields that we can calculate . </S>",
    "<S> since the diagonal components of @xmath78+@xmath80 + 2@xmath82 were determined previously @xcite , all the coupling parameters in the above equations are known except for @xmath90 . at high temperatures , the staggered moments @xmath91 , @xmath92 are much smaller than the uniform moments @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> . assuming @xmath91=@xmath92=0 above @xmath21=70  k , which is also supported by preliminary numerical calculations , we determined @xmath90 from the data of @xmath67 and the magnetization at 70  k , using . </S>",

    "<S> we then obtained @xmath74 at other temperatures ( ) from the magnetization data . </S>",
    "<S> finally , subtracting this from @xmath67 , @xmath75 is determined in the whole temperature range as shown in . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the staggered magnetization increases very steeply below 10 k and saturates at lower temperatures .    </S>",

    "<S> the curves are obtained from the ed results of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 shown in the inset by using and . ]    in order to see if these results are explained by anisotropic interactions , we have calculated @xmath41 by exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the hamiltonian @xmath104+@xmath40+@xmath105 at @xmath21=0 and @xmath76=6.948  t in the ( @xmath910)-plane for clusters with up to 24 sites for various values of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> values of other parameters are fixed : @xmath17=85  k , @xmath18=54  k @xcite , @xmath106=-0.02 @xcite , and @xmath35=0.023 . by requiring that the calculated value of @xmath67 from to agrees with the experimental data at the lowest temperature ( 2.5  k ) , we obtained @xmath107=0.034 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the uncertainty in @xmath38 leads to possible values of @xmath107 between 0.030 ( for @xmath108 ) and 0.038 ( for @xmath109 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of @xmath110 has little effect on the calculated values of @xmath41 .    using the same parameter values , we have also calculated @xmath41 at higher fields , as shown in the inset of in . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the calculated results of @xmath74 and @xmath75 shown by the lines in the main panel of and the experimental data is satisfactory up to about 20  t. thus we now have a _ quantitative _ explanation for the development of a uniform magnetization at fields as low as 18  t. note that the staggered moment is sizable even at low fields ( @xmath111cu at 15  t , inset ) , where the uniform moment is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and theoretical results of @xmath75 deviate at higher fields , probably due to finite size effects as discussed below .     </S>",
    "<S> ( inset ) are compared with the results of ed calculation ( open circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data at 27.5  t , where nmr spectrum show many lines in the 1/8-plateau phase , were obtained for the line with the largest ( negative ) hyperfine field . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate ( 1/@xmath112 ) was measured for @xmath113 up to 27.5  t. it shows an activated behavior at low temperatures ( inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the activation gap ( @xmath114 ) shown in follows a linear @xmath115-dependence below 20  t , @xmath116 with @xmath6=34.8  k and @xmath20=2.28 as expected . at higher fields , however , it deviates from this relation and remains finite even above the expected critical field @xmath4=@xmath117=22.7  </S>",
    "<S> t. the gap reaches a minimum at 26.5  t , which is at the boundary to the 1/8-plateau , and increases again inside the 1/8-plateau ( 27.5  t ) . the finite gap above @xmath4 , which naturally explains the absence of bose condensation , is consistent with earlier reports . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the gap was estimated from the specific heat data @xcite as @xmath114=4.6 ( 3.2 )  k at @xmath76=22 ( 24 )  t. the esr data @xcite also shows a similar deviation from the linear @xmath115-dependence of the lowest triplet energy near @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> one expects that the singlet - triplet mixing due to @xmath73 will prevent the gap from closing , as has been discussed for nenp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed this by numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the lowest excited state obtained by ed calculations using the same parameters is plotted in . </S>",
    "<S> the constant value at low fields is due to the singlet bound state of two triplets having lower energy than one triplet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , they do not contribute to the nuclear relaxation . near 22  t , </S>",
    "<S> the results clearly indicate level repulsion due to mixing , reproducing the experimental behavior . </S>",
    "<S> let us note one subtle point . </S>",
    "<S> the interdimer dm interaction @xmath105 splits the one - triplet excitations into two branches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only one of them is mixed with the singlet by @xmath73 and this branch must have a lower energy for the level repulsion to occur . </S>",
    "<S> this determines the sign of @xmath110 to be negative . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sign of @xmath110 was not known before .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the theory is not applicable when the field is too close to the 1/8-plateau . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster size of our calculation is not large enough to take proper account of interaction between triplets , which should become important near the 1/8-plateau .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a large staggered magnetization is induced by the magnetic field in the presence of the intradimer dm interaction and staggered @xmath3-tensor , whose magnitudes are obtained as @xmath118 for @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet - triplet mixing and level repulsion caused by these interactions account for the finite uniform magnetization below @xmath4 and the persistence of the excitation gap above @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> they thus turn the quantum phase transition at @xmath4 into a crossover . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first example of such field - induced phenomena in quasi 2d spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> our determination of the magnitudes and sign of the dm interactions should set the stage for further investigation of other remarkable properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . </S>",
