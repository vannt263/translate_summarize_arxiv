    "there are experimental evidences that in nuclei with neutron excess , in addition to the well known giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , a new type of dipole resonance appears @xcite .",
    "since this resonance has smaller strength than that of the gdr and exhausts only a small fraction of the energy weighted sum rule , it is called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) .",
    "the pdr appears at lower energy with respect to the gdr but it is not its low - energy tail , since it has an isoscalar ( @xmath1 ) character and it is dominated by neutron excitations , while the gdr has isovector ( @xmath2 ) character with almost equal contribution of proton and neutron excitations .    the existence of a new type of resonance in nuclei is an interesting subject by itself . in the present case",
    "the interest is also related to the fact that the presence of the pdr may have some relevant consequences in the stellar r - process production of exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "we have studied how the pdr emerges when neutrons become more numerous than protons .",
    "the nuclear model adopted in our calculation is the traditional discrete random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "non relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite rpa approaches have been used in the past to investigate the pdr .",
    "studies of pdr have been also done with more elaborated nuclear models containing pairing @xcite and spreading widths @xcite .",
    "usually these calculations have been done to make detailed investigations of the pdr characteristics in a limited set of isotopes .",
    "our goal here is to search for general trends of the pdr in various nuclei belonging to different regions of the nuclear isotope table , from oxygen to lead . for this purpose",
    "we have defined two indexes which enable us to distinguish between pdr and gdr .",
    "we tested the validity of these investigation tools on the @xmath3pb nucleus where we found a resonance with all the features we attribute to the pdr at about 7.7 mev , against an experimental evidence around 7.35 mev @xcite .",

    "we further investigated this point by considering the ratio @xmath14 between the integrated @xmath10 low energy strength and the total strength .",

    "a linear growth is observed for a=108 - 116 , then the value of @xmath14 for @xmath12sn is almost equal to that for @xmath11sn , and it starts to grow again , but more slowly , when passing from @xmath12sn to @xmath5sn .",
    "this behavior resembles that observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where , within a relativistic rpa framework , a linear correlation between the ratio of the low - energy to high - energy dipole strength and the neutron skin of the sn isotopes was obtained for @xmath18 , followed by an apparent mild anticorrelation for @xmath19 .",

    "[ sec : model ] , we have critically discussed merits and faults of our approach which we think to be reliable in predicting position and total strength of the resonance .    the dipole excited states have been studied by analyzing their collectivity , their isospin character and the relevance on neutron and proton p - h excitations .",

    "we should mention here that we have also investigated the vorticity of the excitations @xcite , as it has been suggested in @xcite , but we did not find significant differences between the results in the pdr and gdr regions .",
    "our work consisted in studying 1@xmath28 excitations in isotopic chains built around doubly closed shell nuclei , to identify the possible presence of pdr .",
    "the signals we searched for identifying the pdr are high degree of collectivity , @xmath1 character and neutron dominated excitation .",
    "we have first applied our model to oxygen isotopes where we observed an increase of the @xmath0 strength at low energies .",

    "@xcite , where the calculations were done in a fully self - consistent hartree - fock plus rpa approach with skyrme - like interactions .",
    "the problem is still open . in any case , we should point out that the oxygen nuclei are relatively light and in our approach the number of p - h pairs responsible for the low - lying excitations is so small that it is difficult to consider these excited states as collective excitation of the nucleus ( see the values of @xmath13  in table [ tab : oxy ] ) .",
    "we found positive results for all the other isotopic chains we have investigated .",
    "our calculation for the @xmath29ca produces strength around 8.5 mev in agreement with the experimental findings of ref .",
    "@xcite and with the results of ref .",
    "also the results in tin isotopes show low energy strength and confirm the experimental finding of ref .",
    "we identify this excitation as pdr as it has been done in @xcite .",
    "this result is in contrast with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained with self - consistent calculations which consider also effects beyond the rpa , in terms of phonon coupling .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that few p - h excitations are responsible for the low energy states , while our calculations give quite a relevant collectivity for these states .",
    "in the study of the zirconium isotopes we have found a handbook example of the role played by the neutrons in excess .",
    "the contribution of the state at about 8.5 mev to the @xmath10 strength becomes relevant only in the heavier isotopes , where the neutrons in excess strongly contribute to the excitation and make it collective .",
    "our calculations clearly indicate that the appearance of the pdr is a common feature of medium- heavy - nuclei . by studying the ratio between the low energy and the total integrated @xmath10 strength we have seen that the relevance of the pdr increases with increasing neutron number .",
