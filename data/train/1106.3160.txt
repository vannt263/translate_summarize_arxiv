    "an important challenge imposed by cmos downscaling is the growth of ultra - thin oxides of silicon of high quality , with a tight thickness control and a good uniformity @xcite . very important",
    "progress have been done during the last decade to improve the structural properties and electrical limits of ultra - thin ( @xmath0 nm ) silicon oxide and oxynitride @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "the modeling of ultra - thin silicon oxide growth remains a difficult issue for the microelectronics industry .",
    "to date , the seminal work of deal and grove remains the main approach used in process simulators to describe the oxide growth @xcite . assuming a steady state reaction between molecular oxygen and silicon , deal and grove deduced that the oxide growth can simply be described by the following equation :    @xmath1\\ ] ]    where the oxide thickness @xmath2 is described by a linear - parabolic relationship as a function of the oxidation time @xmath3 .",
    "the term @xmath4 characterizes the initial linear rate growth .",
    "the parabolic rate constant @xmath5 governs the diffusion limited regime .",
    "an initial time offset @xmath6 is necessary to take into account the presence of an initial thick oxide layer .",
    "the success of this model can be explained by its ability to describe both dry and wet oxide in the case of thick oxide .",
    "another major achievement is the introduction by kao et al .",
    "@xcite of the influence of strain effects in the deal and grove approach . using this generalized deal and",
    "grove approach , kao et al . explained the retardation effect observed for the oxidation of curved surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , this model suffers from strong limitations such as the failure to describe the fast initial growth regime for dry oxidation @xcite or the difficulties to extend it to oxynitridation process @xcite .",
    "much research work has been dedicated to elucidate the breakdown of the deal & grove model in the ultra - thin regime .",
    "the idea was to correct the deal and grove model by adding some empirical terms to the growth rate @xcite .",
    "however , the physical origin of these terms is subject to discussion .",
    "an alternative approach has been proposed by wolters et al . who considered that mobile ionic species are responsible of the silicon oxidation process @xcite .",
    "ionic transport and induced electric field considered in this model could explain some of the experimental phenomena observed in silicon oxidation such as the rate dependence on the orientation or the cross - over effects @xcite .",
    "but the role of charged species in the oxidation mechanism is still debated even , for more fundamental simulations such as density functional theory @xcite . recently",
    ", a new alternative linear parabolic rate equation has also been proposed by watanabe et al . @xcite without the rate - limiting step of the oxidation reaction but assuming that diffusivity is suppressed in a strained oxide near the silicon interface .    from the above discussion ,",
    "a revision of the deal and grove model is clearly necessary to improve process simulation . an ideal model for the microelectronics industry must give access to : ( i ) a fundamental and quantitative understanding of the interaction between oxygen , silicon and the standard dopant at the si / sio@xmath7 to better describe segregation effects @xcite or to estimate the dose - loss of dopant , ( ii ) the amount of silicon interstitials at the interface ( iii ) the amount of nitrogen incorporated during a more complex oxynitridation process ( no , n@xmath7o gas ) to estimate the gate leakage current @xcite .",
    "the development of such model still represents a big challenge .",
    "moreover , a multiscale modeling of silicon oxidation @xcite will probably be mandatory to simulate the growth of ultimate oxides ( @xmath8 1 nm ) fabricated by advanced oxidation process such as plasma nitridation step @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the modeling of dry oxidation kinetics at low temperature in the nanometer range is investigated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the reaction rate formalism is presented . the calibration method and some preliminary results",
    "are also discussed .",
    "experiment at low temperature are described in section iii .",
    "the two standard models ( deal and grove @xcite , massoud @xcite ) and the reaction rate approach are confronted with the experimental data in section iv .",
    "most important conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "an interesting study in silicon oxidation modeling has been published by almeida et al . @xcite . the main idea of this work is to analyze the main assumptions of the deal and grove model and to propose a more rigorous approach .",
    "the first approximation made by deal and grove is to consider that the reaction strictly takes place at the interface .",
    "the second approximation is the steady state regime which imposes the a balance between oxidizing species entering the sio@xmath7 surface , the number of molecules diffusing into the oxide and the molecules reacting at the si / sio@xmath7 interface .",
    "thus the concentration of the oxidant species is not time dependent . as outlined in an very elegant way by almeida et al .",
    ", these assumptions are certainly the key to explain the limitations of the deal and grove model in the ultra - thin regime for dry oxidation .",
    "moreover these assumptions limits the development of more sophisticated treatment of the oxidation mechanism .      in this paper , a reaction rate approach similar to that of almeida et al .",
    "@xcite has been adopted for the modeling of our experimental kinetic at low temperature .",
    "the main diffusing species is assumed to be molecular oxygen ( o@xmath7 ) as demonstrated by several isotopic experiments @xcite .",
    "the two other species are pure silicon ( si ) and silicon dioxide ( sio@xmath7 ) .",
    "the reaction of oxidation is simply given by :                            c and 750@xmath9c ( points ) and our model derived by the reaction rate approach ( lines ) .",
    "the first experimental kinetics is nicely described by the model whereas the second experimental kinetics is slightly overestimated .",
