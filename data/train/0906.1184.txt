    "we will refer to this unexpected phenomenon as the `` @xmath2 wing signatures '' .",
    "this observation contradicts the long held standard theory for the hanle effect , according to which the hanle effect should only be effective in the line core but not in the line wings .",

    "@xcite suggested a qualitative explanation for the observed @xmath3 wing signatures in terms of partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) and radiative transfer ( multiple scattering ) effects in the wings of strong resonance lines .",
    "thus , in a balanced mixture of coherent and non - coherent scattering , it is possible to generate hanle depolarization in the wings as follows : hanle precession of the oscillating dipole moment is first generated near the resonance ( in the line core ) , but gets shifted to a wing frequency by an elastic collision without destroying the atomic polarization .",
    "the atom subsequently emits the photon at the shifted frequency in the line wing .",
    "this process would be the source of the @xmath3 wing signatures .",

    "lsa exploits the fact that the polarization of the radiation that escapes the atmosphere is mainly determined by the anisotropy of the radiation field at the place where the last scattering process takes place .",
    "since the polarization amplitudes in the lines are small , the polarization of the incident radiation at the last scattering event can be neglected . in other words ,",
    "the emergent polarization is produced in a single scattering event ( the very last one ) rather than through multiple scattering within the atmosphere .    in the practical application of this idea",

    "here @xmath16 is the effective atomic polarizability factor , which is unity for the cai 4227  line , since it behaves like classical dipole scattering .",

    "since a true continuum is usually not recorded , we choose a reference wavelength @xmath27 at which we are as close to the continuum as we can be .",

    "the coherent scattering ( cs ) limit can for example be obtained from the general prd expression by choosing @xmath102 as the redistribution function .",
    "the angular dependence of the scattering process is then given by the non - magnetic rayleigh phase matrix .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ prdonoff ] that except in the line core , where cs differs greatly from angle - dependent prd ( heavy solid line , which is the same as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ flatkgvskg ] ) , pure coherent scattering ( cs , dashed line ) provides a good approximation at the cai 4227  wing frequencies .",
    "in fact coherent scattering gives deeper minima in the blend lines than prd .",
    "this is because when @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the model profile obtained with coherent scattering exactly mimics the @xmath18 spectrum , while prd modifies it significantly in the inner core of the cai 4227 line and also in the cores of the blend lines ( because although @xmath98 has coherent peaks in the wings , such peaks are not exactly delta functions unlike the case of pure coherent scattering and cause some broadening ) .",
    "[ prdonoff ] also shows a model profile computed with the assumption of crd ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "we recover the crd limit from the general expression by using @xmath105 for the redistribution function .",
    "the shape of the model profile obtained with crd can be easily understood from eqs .",
    "( [ qbyi_nonmag_model ] ) and ( [ pqline_prd ] ) . in crd",
    "the redistribution matrix elements are @xmath106 , and @xmath107 ( see eg .",
    "* for the rayleigh phase matrix expression ) .",
    "thus @xmath108 becomes wavelength independent and is given by @xmath109 therefore the line contribution becomes constant at a value that is found to be 6% .",
    "the shape of the crd model profile is then entirely due to the factor @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ qbyi_nonmag_model ] ) . as @xmath111 ,",
    "this factor is close to unity at line center , where we have @xmath112 . for the value of @xmath99 derived from the best fit ( obtained with prd ) , @xmath113 .",
    "as we move away from the line center , the factor @xmath110 decreases monotonically , and there is no possibility of modeling the observed @xmath0 maxima of the cai 4227 line anywhere in the line wings .",
    "we emphasize that it is not only the anisotropy of the incident radiation field that governs the shape and magnitude of the wing maxima in @xmath0 , but also a realistic redistribution mechanism , namely prd .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ prdonoff ] a comparison between the model @xmath0 profile based on the angle - averaged @xmath114 ( thin solid line ) and angle - dependent @xmath98 ( heavy solid line ) prd mechanisms .",
    "both succeed well in modeling the wing peaks within our lsa framework .",
    "the differences are noticeable only in the line core .",
    "the double peak in the line core has also been seen in the radiative transfer modeling by @xcite , who use @xmath114 .",
    "note that the same qualitative features of @xmath115 that we have found here for different line scattering mechanisms ( cs , crd , @xmath114 , and @xmath98 ) may not be reproduced with the same details in full scale radiative transfer modeling .",
    "comparison with the observed @xmath0 spectrum shows that lsa allows us to model the @xmath0 wings extremely well .",
    "with lsa we can fit the envelope ( above the blend line depressions ) of the observed @xmath0 .",
    "the line core of cai 4227 is however not modeled so well by lsa , although correct qualitative features like the @xmath0 dips around the doppler core are reproduced .",
    "this is also the case after including the contribution from @xmath116 type scattering through the introduction of elastic collisions ( see below ) .",
    "this means that lsa does not work well enough in the line core , and that one may need radiative - transfer physics to explain the core shape of @xmath0 .",
    "this question is something we like to pursue in a future work by modeling the cai 4227  line with full radiative transfer , to allow us to clarify and identify what aspect of radiative transfer is the source of the difference that we see in the line core .",
    "the fit of the observations with the last scattering model leads to a scaling factor @xmath86 of 32.5%  rather than unity , which may be due to collisional depolarization , although radiative transfer effects may also cause deviations from lsa .",
    "if the main contribution to the scaling parameter @xmath86 comes from elastic collisions , then the scaling parameter gives us an estimate of the elastic collision rate @xmath22 .",
    "in the following section we discuss the effect of @xmath22 on the model profiles , as it plays an important role in the modeling .      in the previous sections we considered only limiting cases of frequency redistribution , namely frequency coherent scattering in the atomic frame ( i.e. , pure @xmath98 in the laboratory frame ) and crd .",
    "we now consider more realistic situations , where both types of scattering may occur , i.e. , a weighted combination of @xmath98 and @xmath116 type scattering .",
    "the weights are the branching ratios given by @xmath117 for coherent scattering ( in the atomic frame ",

    "@xmath22 is due to collisions with neutral hydrogen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of @xmath22 on @xmath0 is to reduce the polarization at all wavelengths , and thereby make the scaling parameter @xmath86 become unity .",

    "in general @xmath1 spectra of either sign are equally likely , as they are due to a rotation angle that can be both positive and negative . in this paper",
    "we refer to the ` @xmath128 spectrum ' to avoid confusion when we speak about polarization maxima in the line wings",
    ". ambiguity might arise if we would instead speak of wing minima in @xmath1 , since the absolute value of the polarization always has wing _ maxima _ in both the @xmath130 and @xmath128 cases .",
    "the parameters required for the modeling are hanle @xmath131 in standard notation , and @xmath132 representing the orientation of a directed magnetic field , defined with respect to the vertical direction in the atmosphere . the elastic collision rate @xmath22 is also used as a free parameter .",
    "we recall that the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 determined from the non - magnetic model fit for a given choice of @xmath84 ( as listed in table  [ free_para_model ] ) are kept constant when the magnetic field parameters are varied . in this way we have attempted to model the observed @xmath3 spectra outside the so called `` non - magnetic '' regions , and at the spatial locations where the @xmath3 wing signatures are seen .",
    "the framework that has been developed in the previous sections for modeling the non - magnetic @xmath0 can still be used in the magnetized case with the modifications described in ",
    "[ sec_hanle_model ] . for the purpose of discussion",
    "we introduce a quantity @xmath133 , which is a measure of the depolarization caused by the combined effect of magnetic and collisional depolarization that we get in prd . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ obs_res2 ] we observe depolarization in @xmath0 ( with respect to the non - magnetic @xmath0 ) , not only in the line core , but also in the wings ( compare the solid and dashed lines in that figure ) . to model these observations ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ obs_res2 ] ) , we varied the field parameters @xmath134 and the elastic collision strength @xmath84 .",
    "our study shows that with the choice of pure @xmath98 to represent the prd mechanism we do not get any wing depolarization ( @xmath135 ) , regardless of the choice of the field parameters .",
    "however , when we introduce elastic collisions we find that for an optimum choice of the combination @xmath136 , we do get wing depolarization ( @xmath137 ) in @xmath0 .",
    "let us next discuss briefly a few interesting aspects of this study .",
    "all the tests have been made for the field strength range @xmath138 .    in the line core @xmath139 decreases towards zero as @xmath84 increases .",
    "this shows that for large values of @xmath84 the effect of collisional depolarization dominates over the effect of magnetic depolarization in the line core . in the line wings",
    "@xmath140 when @xmath141 . for @xmath142 the wing signature",
    "@xmath139 initially increases slowly with @xmath84 , and then decreases towards zero with a further increase of the collision strength .",
    "for example , when @xmath143 we observe hanle depolarization that extends into the wings as shown in fig .",
    "[ model_ubyi ] ( compare the heavy solid and the thin solid lines ) , but no wing peaks are obtained in @xmath139 that is represented by the dashed line . if we further increase @xmath84 ( say to 100 ) , then @xmath139 vanishes in the line wings and becomes almost zero also in the line core , implying that the collisional depolarization effect again dominates over the magnetic depolarization effect .",
    "these two competing effects together decide the extent of depolarization in the wings .",
    "our modeling efforts turn out to be unsuccessful in reproducing the observed wing maxima in @xmath128 , contrary to our expectations .",
    "we expected that the elastic collisions play a significant role in transferring the hanle effect from the line core to the line wings without destroying the atomic polarization @xcite .",
    "this expectation is satisfied to some extent for @xmath0 for an optimum choice of the parameter pair @xmath136 , but even in this optimized case we fail to reproduce the wing maxima that are observed in @xmath139 . in the case of @xmath1",
    "we find that for @xmath141 the amplitude of @xmath1 in the line core gradually decreases when @xmath84 increases , but correspondingly no wing peaks appear at all .",
    "for @xmath144 , @xmath1 in the line core initially increases slightly with @xmath84 but then decreases with the further increase in the collision strength .",
    "again no wing peaks appear .",
    "variations of the magnetic field parameters also do not help to reproduce the @xmath1 wing peaks ( like they failed to reproduce the @xmath139 wing peaks ) .",
    "the line core peak in @xmath1 on the other hand sensitively responds to variations of all the above free parameters , in a manner that is well understood @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have developed a simple framework based on the last scattering approximation ( lsa ) to model the second solar spectrum .",
    "this approximation gives excellent fits to the linear polarization that is observed in the wings of spectral lines , as demonstrated for the case of the cai 4227  line .",
    "however , fitting the line core polarization may require the solution of the polarized radiative transfer equations ( including prd ) , at least for strong resonance lines .",
    "the most important quantity in our modeling is the anisotropy factor @xmath18 , which we determine from the observed center - to - limb variation of the stokes @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "the detailed wavelength variation of the limb - darkening function plays a fundamental role and is responsible in particular for the occurrence of @xmath0 minima that surround the core region and separates it from the wing maxima .",
    "another key ingredient is the appropriate partial frequency redistribution matrix to be used .",
    "the detailed validity range of the last scattering approximation ( extent of its applicability in the line cores of strong lines and throughout the line profiles in the case of weak lines ) needs to be explored by benchmark tests with full scale radiative transfer , before the diagnostic potential of this approach can be fully exploited .",
    "we have applied the lsa framework to explore the question whether the observed spatial variations in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wings of the cai 4227  line may be explained in terms of the hanle effect , which usually is confined to the doppler core of spectral lines but could in principle become active in the far line wings through frequency redistribution mediated by elastic collisions .",
    "such hanle - like wing signatures were noticed for the first time in active regions by @xcite , but in the present paper we report observations showing that these wing signatures are present in quiet solar regions as well .",
    "our attempts to model these @xmath3 wing signatures failed to reproduce them .",
    "both the @xmath139 profile of the @xmath0 spatial variations and the @xmath128 profile are observed to have maxima in the wings , similar in shape to the @xmath0 non - magnetic profile . however the @xmath139 and @xmath128 modeling failed to retrieve this property , although we searched the whole parameter space of collision rates and magnetic - field parameters .",
    "this null result appears to rule out a direct magnetic - field origin ( via the hanle effect ) of the observed spatial variations of the scattering polarization in the line wings , in contradiction to earlier suggestions @xcite , at least within the framework of the currently available prd theory .",
    "this points in the direction of a non - magnetic interpretation , which may include local deviations from a plane - parallel stratification ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for some information on the possible effects ) with an inhomogeneous solar atmosphere containing `` hot spots '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* who used this mechanism to interpret the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations seen abundantly in the ca k line ) .",
    "the local density inhomogeneities may also cause significant fluctuations of the collisional depolarization rate .",
    "detailed analysis of these possibilities is outside the scope of the present paper , but such alternative interpretations clearly need to be explored .",
    "ideally one would like to do 2-d mapping of the stokes vector ( rather than work with single slit positions ) with high spatial resolution to map the polarization signatures together with the intensity structures to examine whether the non - magnetic interpretation is viable .",
    "the non - magnetic interpretation is not without its own problems .",
    "thus with a simple - minded model for spatially varying deviations from a plane - parallel stratification one would expect a spatial correlation between the line wing fluctuations seen in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but such a correlation seems to be weak or nearly absent in our observations .",
    "this indicates that the 3-d atmospheric structuring that one would need is more complex , and that we may have to consider a mixture of geometry and collisional effects .",
    "it is important to quantify how much the atmosphere deviates from a plane - parallel stratification in lines of various strengths , and how these deviations are spatially structured , and coupled to the opacity structure within the line as we move from the core to the wings of the line .",
    "while this is a challenging problem , it is within reach with the new generation of observing facilities that are becoming available .",
    "the problem can also be approached by numerical simulations to generate 3-d atmospheric models , and then use 3-d radiative transfer to compute the linearly polarized line profiles that emerge from this atmosphere ( e.g. , as done by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the sri 4607  line assuming crd ) .",
