    "the brownian dynamics of particles in fluids is of high relevance in many fields of natural and applied sciences .",
    "it is strongly affected by the interplay between the particles via the liquid , the so - called hydrodynamic interaction . especially in the field of microfluidics",
    "this nonlinear interaction plays an important role in subjects such as taylor dispersion @xcite or fluid mixing @xcite . in a quiescent fluid",
    "there is already a considerable understanding of the dynamics of brownian particles and their interactions @xcite .",
    "investigations on the positional correlation functions of two trapped particles give further insight in the coupling between thermal motion and the hydrodynamic interaction among them @xcite .",
    "however , the understanding of this interplay in typical laminar flows , like in a linear shear flow or in a poiseuille flow , is still far from complete although it is the origin of a number of interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , polymers exhibit in shear flows already at small values of the reynolds number the so - called molecular individualism @xcite , elastic turbulence , and spectacular mixing properties in the dilute regime @xcite .",
    "the complex interplay between brownian motion and hydrodynamic interaction also affects considerably the conformational distribution functions of tethered polymers in flows and their dynamics @xcite .",
    "when polymers are attached to a wall and subjected to a flow , an additional time - periodic behavior influences the dynamics @xcite , which shows similar features as tumbling polymers in shear flows @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical investigations on the fluid - velocity fluctuations in shear flows show that in contrast to quiescent fluids or uniform flows , cross - correlations between velocity fluctuations along and perpendicular to the streamlines occur @xcite . for free brownian particles in a linear shear flow in @xmath0 direction , where the shear plane is parallel to the @xmath1 plane",
    ", one also expects a cross - correlation between the orthogonal positional fluctuations @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the particles , i.e. @xmath4 @xcite . in this case , random jumps of a particle between neighboring parallel streamlines lead to a change of the particle s velocity .",
    "for example , a positional fluctuation , @xmath3 , perpendicular to the streamlines may cause a fluctuation , @xmath2 , along the streamlines and contributes in this way to the correlation function @xmath5 , which reflects the shear - induced coupling between fluctuations along orthogonal directions .",
    "the theoretical considerations described in ref .",
    "@xcite show that shear - induced cross - correlations between perpendicular random particle displacements , like @xmath6 , survive if a particle experiences some constraints such as a harmonic potential .",
    "this is important from various points of view .",
    "first , these cross - correlations are inherently present in bead - spring models , which are used to describe polymer dynamics in shear flows , because the individual beads along the chain are bound to their neighbors .",
    "second , this knowledge facilitates the experimental detection of these cross - correlations , because measurements of particle fluctuations in the spatially limited area of the trapping potential can be performed in a controlled manner compared to tracing free brownian particles . according to this strategy , the cross - correlations @xmath5 of trapped particles in a linear shear flow",

    "anti - correlations have been detected between two hydrodynamically interacting and neighboring particles in a quiescent fluid , each one captured by a laser - tweezer potential @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where shear - induced inter - particle anti - correlations between orthogonal motions of the two particles have been found .",
    "the present work focuses on the question , which kind of cross - correlations can be expected between hydrodynamically interacting particles in linear shear flows .",
    "such inter - particle correlations along a single polymer and between different polymers in flows influence their dynamics .",
    "this paper is an extension of the theoretical work on the single particle dynamics described in ref .",
    "@xcite to a pair of two hydrodynamically interacting point - particles with an effective hydrodynamic radius and trapped in a linear shear flow .",
    "it provides the theoretical background for the experimental results on the two - particle correlations presented in ref .",
    "the correlation functions between the different particle displacements are calculated analytically and we show how a second brownian particle influences the stochastic motion and the positional probability distribution of its neighbor compared to the single particle case @xcite . in addition , we find that the anti cross - correlations between two fluctuating particles in a quiescent fluid , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , experience shear - induced corrections .",
    "we also describe the occurrence of shear - induced anti cross - correlations between the fluctuations of the two particles along two orthogonal directions .",
    "the results depend significantly on the orientation of the connection vector between the two traps with respect to the flow direction .",
    "we focus on the leading order contributions to the correlation functions and neglect the effects of finite size and rotations of the particles .",
