    "in superconducting rings , the requirement of a single - valued , macroscopic quantum mechanical wave - function , combined with the intimate relation between the quantum mechanical phase and the vector potential , results in flux quantization.@xcite under the appropriate conditions , two of the flux quantized states can become degenerate , characterized by time - reversed , persistent supercurrents circulating in a clockwise and counter - clockwise direction .",
