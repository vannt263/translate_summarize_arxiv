    "fully compensated half - metallic ferrimagnets ( also known as half - metallic antiferromagnets ) @xcite have promising properties for spintronics . due to their internal spin compensation ,",
    "the total moment is ( nearly ) zero at low temperature , yet the possibly strong local moments allow for high curie temperatures .",
    "however , approaching the curie temperature one expects to find a non - zero total magnetic moment @xcite . in conjunction with possible appearance of half - metallicity",
    ", such materials would be ideal electrode materials for spin transfer torque switching devices and other advanced applications @xcite .    among the inverse heusler compounds ( space group @xmath1 , prototype hg@xmath0cuti ) @xcite , several compositions with 24 valence electrons",
    "have been identified which could have these unusual properties , in particular cr@xmath0coga and cr@xmath0fege @xcite .",
    "in contrast to regular heusler compounds , the inverse heusler compounds do not possess inversion symmetry , such that the cr atoms become nearest neighbors , which leads to an antiparallel coupling of their magnetic moments due to direct exchange interaction .",
    "these compounds prefer the inverted heusler structure over the regular one and the local moments are predicted to be quite large . in consequence ,",
    "high curie temperatures of 1520k and 748k are expected , respectively @xcite .",
    "experiments indicate that cr@xmath0coga crystallizes in a cubic structure , which might be the inverse heusler structure @xcite . however , magnetization measurements reveal that the cr@xmath0coga compound is susceptible to atomic disorder , which generates a non - zero moment @xcite .",
    "further , the curie temperature was observed to be only about 300k and the electrical resistivity was semimetallic @xcite .",
    "both experimental findings indicate that severe structural disorder must be present and that the actual crystal structure of cr@xmath0coga can not simply be portrayed as the inverse heusler structure .",
    "recent experiments on cr@xmath0fege indicate that this compound crystallizes in a more complex tetragonal structure @xcite .",
    "these experimental results prompted us to perform a stability analysis of these compounds and their relatives of the type cr@xmath0yz ( y = co , fe ; z = al , ga , in , si , ge , sn ) with 24 valence electrons .",
    "our analysis is based on formation energies computed within density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , similar to recent analyses for a large number of heusler and inverse heusler compounds given by gilleen and dronskowski @xcite .",
    "the dft calculations with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite exchange - correlation functional were performed with the elk code @xcite , an implementation of the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method ( flapw ) .",
    "the muffin - tin sphere radii were set to 2.0bohr for all elements and the augmented plane - wave expansion was taken to @xmath2bohr@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4-point meshes with @xmath5 points were used .",
    "we obtained formation energies ( zero - temperature formation enthalpies ) with respect to the elemental solids from the total energies of the compounds and the total energies per atom of the constituent elements in their respective ground - state structures : @xmath6 the total energy differences were converged to within 10mev .",
    "structural relaxations of the constituent elements were performed with the gpaw code @xcite .",
    "decompositions into binary phases were studied with the help of the _ materials project _ database @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     for comparison we have calculated the formation energies of the co@xmath0fesi , co@xmath0fege , co@xmath0fesn series of full heusler compounds .",
    "we find @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9ev / f.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "indeed , co@xmath0fesn is known to be thermodynamically unstable and to disintegrate into binary phases , but it can be synthesized in the heusler phase in a non - equilibrium process @xcite . its binary decomposition into cofe + cosn has a formation energy of @xmath10ev / f.u .",
    "in contrast , co@xmath0crsi has a formation energy of @xmath11ev / f.u . , yet it is found to be unstable and to form disordered and binary phases @xcite .",
    "the most favorable binary decomposition is co@xmath0si + cr , with a formation energy of -1.35ev / f.u .",
    "searching for possible binary decompositions of the cr based compounds , we find that also cr@xmath0coal and cr@xmath0fesi are unstable .",
    "cr@xmath0coal would most likely decompose into 2cr + coal ( @xmath12ev / f.u . ) , whereas 3cr@xmath0fesi would decompose into 2cr@xmath13si + fe@xmath13si ( @xmath14ev / f.u . ) .",
    "the most favorable binary reactions for the six compounds are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "for completeness , we study the magnetism as a function of the lattice constant of cr@xmath0fesi and cr@xmath0coal in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the absolute moment denotes the sum of the absolute values of muffin - tin moments .",
    "the energy zero is chosen as the sum of the elemental total energies , i.e. , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "cr@xmath0fesi is nonmagnetic at its equilibrium lattice constant , but turns into a weak ferrimagnet at slightly increased volume .",
    "cr@xmath0coal has a ferrimagnetic ground - state in the inverse heusler structure .",
    "due to the similarly large magnetic moments as in cr@xmath0coga , a high curie temperature may be expected for this compound @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the energy of formation for six chromium based ternary materials with inverse heusler structure , which potentially could form compensated ferrimagnets .",
    "we have shown that all of these compounds are thermodynamically unstable , having positive formation energy or because of energetically more favorable binary decompositions",
    ". however , the inverse heusler structure may be metastable at finite temperature , eventually opening a path to the synthesis of the compounds we have studied .",

    "we further thank gnter reiss for his support .",
