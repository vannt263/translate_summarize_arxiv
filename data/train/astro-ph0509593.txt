    "a number of physical mechanisms are expected to play a role in determining the properties of a galaxy : e.g. , ram pressure stripping , harrassment , and strangulation  @xcite .",
    "many of these operate in dense environments .",
    "so the existence of a morphology  density relation  the fraction of galaxies which have elliptical rather than spiral morphologies is higher in denser regions @xcite  is not unexpected . for similar reasons ,",
    "recent measurements of lower star - formation rates in denser regions , which appears to persist even at fixed morphology @xcite and stellar mass @xcite , are not unexpected . however ,",
    "determining which , if any , of the physical mechanisms mentioned above is the dominant one is more difficult .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation models have been rather successful at reproducing the morphology  density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models ,",
    "a correlation between galaxy - type and environment arises even if none of the physical mechanisms mentioned above are present .",
    "the correlation is a consequence of the following assumptions .",
    "gravity has transformed small fluctuations in the early universe into the structures we see today .",
    "this transformation was hierarchical , in the sense that small virialized objects formed first , and then merged with one another to form more massive virialized objects at a later time .",
    "the virialized objects present at any given time , called dark matter haloes , are approximately 200 times denser than the background universe at the time @xcite .",
    "galaxies form from gas which cools within virialized dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the properties of a galaxy are determined entirely by the mass and formation history of the dark matter halo within which it formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "halo masses and formation histories are directly related to the structure of the initial density fluctuation field from which they formed @xcite . in hierarchical models",
    ", there is a correlation between fluctuations on different scales , and this induces correlations between halo mass and/or formation and the larger scale environment of a halo @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , induces a correlation between galaxy - type and environment .",
    "this correlation is entirely _ statistical _ in nature .",
    "so it is interesting to ask if this statistical correlation is sufficient to explain most of the observed correlation between galaxy - type and environment .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to show how analysis of the clustering of galaxies can be used to quantify the strength of this statistical correlation between galaxy properties and environment .",
    "the idea is to show the strength of the statistical effect alone : any discrepancy with observations can then be ascribed to the other physical processes @xcite .",
    "although our argument is general , we focus in particular on the two - point correlation function , @xmath0 , and show how it is expected to depend on environment if the only environmental effects on galaxy properties are those which arise from the statistics of the initial fluctuation field .",
    "the present analysis is intended to complement traditional measures of the environmental dependence of clustering which tend to focus on correlations between the distribution of an observable ( e.g. , the luminosity function , or the star formation rate , etc . ) and the environment ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the gif and vls numerical simulations we use to illustrate our arguments were made available to the public by the virgo consortium .",

    ", we used the halo and particle distributions in the @xmath2cdm gif simulations @xcite .",
    "the simulations contain approximately 90,000 haloes which each have at least ten particles , where the virialized halos were found using a friends - of - friends group finding program .",
    "we defined the environment of a halo by using the mass @xmath14 within a sphere of radius @xmath15 centred on the halo .",
    "we set @xmath16 or @xmath9mpc , but any value which is substantially larger than the typical virial radius ( a few hundred kpc ) , but smaller than the scale on which the universe is essentially homogeneous , will do .",

    "the particles belonging to the top one - third of the haloes were labeled as belonging to densest environments , and the particles in the bottom one - third of the halo sample were labeled as belonging to the least dense environments . finally , we computed the correlation function of particles belonging to the haloes in the densest and least dense regions .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ gifdm ] .",
    "there are obvious differences between the two correlation functions .",
    "the correlation function for the particles in dense regions extends to larger scales ; if fit to a power - law , it would have a shallower slope .",

    "as a result , one expects the ratio of the number of massive to low mass haloes to be larger in dense regions than in less dense regions : the mass function in overdense regions should be ` top - heavy ' .",
    "measurements in simulations indicate that this is indeed the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the average halo mass increases with @xmath30 .    in the gif simulations ,",
    "the average mass of the @xmath31 haloes which reside in the densest regions is approximately @xmath32 , whereas the average mass of the @xmath31 haloes which reside in the least dense regions is @xmath33 .",
    "( hence , the two overdensities differed by a factor of approximately 5 . )",
    "the fact that dense regions have a top - heavy mass function has an important consequence for the environmental dependence of the correlation function which we now describe .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the shape of the correlation function in regions with overdensity @xmath30 .",
    "although such regions contain haloes with a range of masses , suppose we require that all haloes have the same mass @xmath35 , chosen to match , say , the mean halo mass in the regions .",
    "if these haloes are not clustered , then @xmath34 is simply a consequence of the shape of the density profiles @xmath36 around haloes @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average number density of haloes surrounded by regions with overdensity @xmath30 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , the haloes are clustered , but @xcite show why ignoring halo clustering should be a good approximation on small scales .",
    "hence , to estimate the small scale correlations as a function of environment , we require an estimate of the shapes of halo density profiles .",
    "when fit to spherical models , the density profiles of haloes in simulations are well fit by the functional form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite . if we assume that the density profiles of @xmath19 haloes are the same in all environments ( we will modify this assumption shortly ) , then @xmath34 is given by inserting this expression for the density profile into the convolution integral above .",
    "the result is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a messy function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( given in * ? ? ?",
    "since @xmath48 is independent of @xmath19 , in such a model , the environmental dependence of @xmath34 comes entirely from the fact that dense regions host the more massive haloes , and halo density profiles depend on halo mass .",
    "the factor of @xmath49 in the denominator derives from the fact that haloes which have a fixed overdensity relative to the global background density @xmath25 have a different overdensity relative to the local background @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ simple ] shows the result of this simple analytic estimate of @xmath34 for the two sets of gif simulation particles : those which reside in the 30,000 haloes with the largest surrounding overdensities ( as described previously ) , and those which reside in the 30,000 haloes with the smallest surrounding overdensities the curves are qualitatively similar to the measurements shown in figure  [ gifdm ] , at least out to scales on which the measurements show an inflection : @xmath1 falls to zero on smaller scales in the less dense regions .",
    "the inflections at @xmath51mpc and @xmath52mpc in the simulations ( figure  [ gifdm ] ) denote the scales which are approximately twice the virial radii of the typical haloes in the two regions . beyond this scale ,",
    "halo - halo correlations become important ; we build a model for this in appendix  [ halomodel ] .    ) , and by less dense regions ( curves which fall to zero at smaller @xmath53 ) , in our toy model .",
    "the number of haloes in the two environments was assumed to be the same , but the halo mass in dense regions was assumed to be larger by a factor of 5 .",
    "solid curves have @xmath54 in both cases , whereas dashed curves include a realistic prescription for the weak mass dependence of @xmath46 . ]",
    "the curves which extend to larger scales are those for particles in the denser regions .",
    "this is easily understood , because dense regions are those for which @xmath35 is larger , and hence @xmath55 is larger .",
    "the reason why @xmath34 on small scales is larger for the less dense regions is more subtle .",
    "the solid curves show results in which we have set @xmath56 and ignored the mass dependence of @xmath46 , and dashed curves include the mass dependence but assume that there is no additional dependence on environment .",
    "clearly , the mass dependence of @xmath46 is not a dominant effect even on scales smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the difference in amplitudes on small scales derives from the factor of @xmath49 in the expression above , and not from the mass dependence of @xmath46 . in the present example",
    ", the number of haloes in the two ( dense and underdense ) regions is the same , but @xmath35 in dense regions is larger , so @xmath49 is larger for the dense regions .",
    "since the shape of @xmath1 is approximately constant on small scales , it has a lower amplitude in denser regions .",
    "the relative unimportance of @xmath46 has the following interesting consequence .",
    "suppose that halo density profiles do depend on environment ( numerical simulations are only just reaching the resolution required to address this question ) .",
    "a simple way of parameterizing this dependence is to allow @xmath46 to depend both on @xmath19 and @xmath30",
    ". if @xmath46 depends only weakly on @xmath30 , then the effect on @xmath1 will only be noticeable on scales smaller than @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the mean @xmath46 ( averaged over environments ) .    on the smaller scales ,",
    "where halo - halo correlations are not important , the differences between the two curves in figure  [ gifdm ] are qualitatively like those of the simple toy model described above , indicating that our use of a mean density - dependent halo mass @xmath35 , rather than a distribution of masses , does capture the essential features of the density dependence of @xmath34 . on larger scales ,",
    "where halo correlations are important , figure  [ gifdm ] shows that @xmath34 is stronger in dense regions .",
    "this is not unexpected in the context of the linear peaks - bias model of @xcite , if , on average , the densest regions at the present time formed from the densest regions in the initial fluctuation field .",
    "this is because , in the initial gaussian random field , the densest regions were more strongly clustered than regions of average density .",
    "therefore , our simple model , in which the environmental dependence of @xmath1 is entirely due to the environmental dependence of the halo mass function , suggests the following generic features for @xmath34 : on scales larger than the virial radius of a typical halo , the amplitude of @xmath1 should increase as @xmath30 increases ; on smaller scales , the amplitude of @xmath1 in underdense regions should be larger ; hence , the slope of @xmath1 in dense regions should be shallower than in less dense regions .      to illustrate that the features described above really are generic , and to make a closer connection to observations",
    ", we assigned mock ` galaxies ' to haloes in the simulations as follows .",
    "sufficiently low mass haloes contain no galaxies .",
    "haloes more massive than some @xmath60 contain at least one galaxy . the first galaxy in a halo is called the ` central ' galaxy .",
    "the number of other ` satellite ' galaxies is drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath61 where @xmath62 this procedure is motivated by @xcite .",
    "we distribute the satellite galaxies in a halo around the halo centre so that the radial profile follows that of the dark matter ( i.e. , the galaxies are assumed to follow an nfw profile ) .",
    "we set @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ; @xcite show that this choice is appropriate for sdss galaxies more luminous than @xmath66 .",
    "we then compute @xmath67 , the number of galaxies in a @xmath17mpc sphere around each galaxy , and rank the galaxies in order of decreasing @xmath67 . the top one - third",
    "are labeled as being galaxies in dense regions , and the bottom third as being in underdense regions .    , but now for model galaxies distributed according to the model described in the text around equation  [ ngsdss ] , and density defined by counting galaxies in spheres centred on the galaxies themselves , rather than the mass in spheres centred on haloes .",
    "curves show the analytic model developed in appendix  [ halomodel ] . ]",
    "figure  [ gifsdss ] presents the correlation functions of the mock galaxies classified as being in dense ( top ) and underdense ( bottom ) regions .",
    "once again we see the generic tendency for @xmath1 computed using objects in denser regions to be shallower than when objects in sparser environments are used .",
    "the important point , which we note explicitly here , is the following : by assuming that equation  ( [ ngsdss ] ) is the same function of @xmath19 for all environments , and by assuming that the radial profile of the galaxies depends only on halo mass and not on environment , we have constructed a galaxy catalog in which all environmental effects are _ entirely _ a consequence of the correlation between halo mass and environment .",
    "therefore , the locii traced out by the two sets of symbols shown in figure  [ gifsdss ] represent the predicted environmental dependence of @xmath1 if there are no environmental effects other than the statistical one determined by the initial fluctuation field .    over the @xmath68mpc range which the sdss data currently probe most reliably , @xmath1 for the dense and underdense samples differs by an order of magnitude .",
    "this difference is easily measurable in data sets which are currently available .",
    "comparison of this predicted difference with measurements in the sdss will provide a sharp test of the assumption that environmental effects are dominated by the statistical correlation between the halo mass function and environment , rather than by other  gastrophysics .",
    "in hierarchical models , the clustering of dark matter particles should be a strong function of environment .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that massive haloes populate the densest regions .",
    "if the properties of galaxies are determined entirely by the masses and formation histories of the haloes in which they sit , then the clustering of galaxies should also depend strongly on environment .",
    "we discussed a method for testing this assumption .",
    "the test is particularly interesting given recent work which suggests that , at fixed mass , haloes in dense regions form at higher redshifts @xcite , and that this effect is a decreasing function of halo mass @xcite .",
    "in particular , section  [ mockgals ] described how to generate a mock galaxy catalog in which all correlations with environment are a consequence of the correlation between halo abundances and environment .",
    "comparison of the environmental dependence of clustering in the mock catalog and in real data allows one to test the assumption that environmental effects are dominated by the statistical correlation between halo mass and environment .",
    "the appendix shows how to incorporate the assumption that environmental effects are determined entirely by the statistical correlation between halo mass and environment into the halo model description of large scale structure . while this model aids in understanding the effect , to perform the test with data , it is unnecessary  measurements of clustering in the mock catalogs of the sort described in section  [ mockgals ] are sufficient .",
    "however , the methodology developed in this work provides a means for computing the clustering properties of galaxies affected by other environment dependent processes ( assuming that some model for @xmath69 could be derived ) that explicitly do not depend upon the surrounding halo mass .",
    "for instance , winds from galaxies in nearby clusters are assumed to depend on the larger scale environment and could affect the clustering statistics .",
    "in particular , on scales larger than a megaparsec or so , the two - point correlation function @xmath1 of galaxies surrounded by high density regions is predicted to be larger than for galaxies in less dense regions .",
    "in addition , the slope of @xmath1 for galaxies in dense regions should be shallower ( cf .",
    "figure  [ gifsdss ] ) . and",
    "if the distribution of galaxies around halo centers depends only weakly on environment ( current analyses of galaxy clustering assume any such dependence is negligible ) , the effect on their clustering amplitude is small .",
    "our test using mock catalogs is unrealistic in one respect : with real data , one only has redshift - space positions , so one can not define the local density in real - space .",
    "however , if the scale on which the redshift - space density is defined is larger than the typical size of redshift - space distortions ( @xmath70mpc ) , then the real and redshift - space densities will not differ substantially .",
    "hence , we do not expect our separation into environments based on the real - space density within @xmath9mpc spheres to differ substantially from that which we would have obtained had we used redshift - space positions instead . a more detailed description of the redshift space method is the subject of work in progress .",
    "( e.g. , what does one gain by measuring both @xmath71 and the projected correlation function as a function of redshift space environment ?",
    "the latter quantity depends on local density for similar reasons that @xmath0 does  the halo mass function depends on environment  whereas @xmath71 will have an additional effect coming from the fact that redshift space distortions depend on halo mass . )",
    "comparison of these predictions with clustering in the sloan digital sky survey is underway .",
    "we thank the virgo consortium for making their simulations available to the public , and the pittsburgh computational astrostatistics group ( pica ) for the npt code which was used to measure the correlation functions in the simulations .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for suggesting minor changes that helped to improve the paper .",
