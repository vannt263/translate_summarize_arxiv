    "ramsey s method of atom interferometry with separated oscillating fields @xcite provides the basis of present primary time standards , as cesium - beam or cesium - fountain setups @xcite .",
    "basically , one aims to lock an oscillator exactly to a given atomic transition frequency to achieve stability and accuracy of the oscillator and thus of the clock .",
    "the physical quantity that indicates possible deviations from the reference transition as a function of detuning is the excitation probability of the ground state atom after the interaction with two separated field pulses , and this function shows the well - known ramsey fringes .",
    "note that as long as quantum reflections of the atom at the fields can be neglected , the operation of the interferometer in time domain ( temporally separated pulses and fixed atom ) or in space domain ( spatially separated fields and moving atom ) is equivalent for atoms moving along classical trajectories , as we shall exploit hereafter .    a central requirement for frequency standards is a narrow interference pattern with respect to detuning , to allow for a precise lock of the oscillating fields to the atomic clock transition .",
    "it has been shown by ramsey @xcite that the width of the central peak of the pattern is inversely proportional to the intermediate time between the two pulses @xmath0 , in contrast to single - field methods where it is inversely proportional to the field - crossing time . in the case of cesium - beam standards , for example , this implicates the desire of using tall `` fountain '' configurations , which of course have a limit in practice because of space constraints , magnetic field control , temperature homogeneity and other technical aspects @xcite ; or very slow ( ultracold ) atoms in reduced gravity @xcite . even though the dependence on the free flight time is far better than on field - crossing time because of the difficulty to implement a homogeneous and stable field",
    ", the free flight occurs for atomic states with an excited component , which should be as stable as possible against radiative decay @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report an effect that leads to a considerable narrowing of the ramsey interference fringes which is stable with respect to the atomic velocity or field mode functions , and relies on the free flight of ground state atoms before entering the first field region .",
    "this effect is based on the use of two field pulses with _",
    "different _ detuning . for simplicity of the presentation",
    ", we neglect in our calculations the transverse momentum transfer on the atom , which is reasonable for moving atoms and microwave frequencies or for trapped ions or atoms in the lamb - dicke regime and optical fields @xcite . for a detailed study of these recoil effects in connection with ramsey interferometry we refer to refs .  @xcite . for freely moving atoms interacting with optical fields ,",
    "one is led normally to consider the multi - beam schemes proposed by kasevich and chu or by bord to compensate for the wavepacket separation due to recoil effects , see @xcite for reviews . however , to suppress transversal momentum transfer one may think on moving atoms in a narrow waveguide , interacting with optical fields @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a waveguide width of @xmath1 and for cesium , the energy gap to the first transversely excited state is @xmath2 .",
    "now , a minor modification of ref .",
    "@xcite to incorporate detuning shows that excitation mainly occurs at the  rabi resonances \" @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rabi frequency and @xmath5 denotes the detuning between laser frequency and atomic transition frequency . for rabi frequencies of the order of @xmath6 one therefore would have a detuning range @xmath7 for which transversal excitation can be neglected .",
    "we consider the basic ramsey setup where either a two - level atom in the ground state moves along the @xmath8 axis and crosses two separated oscillating fields localized between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , or the atom is trapped and the two interaction pulses are separated in time .",
    "in contrast to the standard setting , we allow for different detuning of the two fields with respect to the atomic transition frequency @xmath13 , respectively . the measured quantity is the transmission probability of excited atoms , @xmath14 , as a function of the detuning @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the @xmath18th field .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the moving atom reads in the dipole and rotating - wave approximation and in the schrdinger picture @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath16 , are the rabi frequencies of the two spatially localized fields and the hat @xmath21 is used to distinguish operators from the corresponding c - numbers .",
    "it is important in the following that the time origin has been chosen in a way that the two fields are in phase at @xmath22 . for trapped ions or atoms ,",
    "the kinetic energy term would be absent and the rabi frequencies would be time - dependent , which will not alter the results within the following treatment . the crucial point to note is that for @xmath23 there is no interaction picture for which this time - dependent hamiltonian can be made time - independent , as it is the case for @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the quantum mechanical probabilities , and in particular @xmath14 , will also be time - dependent .    in the atom - adapted interaction picture",
    "with @xmath25 one has @xmath26 in this interaction picture , the atom - field interaction is zero in between the fields and therefore we will favor it for the calculation of @xmath14 .    [ [ remark ] ] remark : + + + + + + +    one may also choose a field - adapted interaction picture with respect to the first or the second field by setting @xmath27 , which leads for @xmath28 to @xmath29 and for @xmath30 to @xmath31 in these interaction pictures the hamiltonian is either constant or periodic with period @xmath32 . for equal detuning , @xmath33 , these pictures would be time - independent and the standard result for @xmath14 would arise .",
    "for fast enough particles , i.e.  for kinetic energies @xmath34 much larger than @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the center - of - mass motion of the atom can be treated classically and independently of the internal dynamics . in that case",
    "the two - component wavefunction @xmath37 which accounts for the internal dynamics in the interaction picture i1 is a solution of the internal schrdinger equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the position of the atom at time @xmath22 . in the following , we consider the internal dynamics for a given kinetic energy @xmath41 , i.e.  for a single atom whose center - of - mass follows the classical trajectory @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the time of the first interaction with the leftmost field , @xmath44 .",
    "this treatment neglects initial uncertainties in position and momentum and is well justified for atoms in a trap and a pulsed experiment .",
    "the case of a bunch of atoms with initial position and momentum distribution crossing to separated fields leads to a distribution of entrance times @xmath43 and it is considered later in sec .",

    "= 8.8 cm = 8.8 cm    an alternative viewpoint of the effect can be given by analyzing the phase mismatch between the two oscillating fields .",
    "this is better suited to understand the experiment with trapped ions and pulsed fields .",

    "up to now , the monochromatic case with a fixed entrance time @xmath43 has been considered .",
    "this holds true for the pulsed experiment and if the micromotion of the atom within the trap can be neglected .",

    "in this paper we have studied the interference fringes in a ramsey interferometer , for the case that the separated fields have different detuning .",

    "our main result is that the width of the ramsey fringes decreases for increasing @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , we have shown that this effect remains stable for atomic clouds with an initial momentum and position distribution and for sinusoidal field mode functions .",
    "a similar effect is achieved in a time domain configuration of atoms at rest by controlling the laser field phases .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the ramsey fringes for differently detuned fields beyond the semiclassical approximation , i.e.  taking into account quantum reflections at the fields for very slow ( ultracold ) atoms .",
    "this has been shown to yield interesting effects in the case of equal detuning @xcite .",
    "however , the quantum treatment of the time - dependent problem leads to difficulties in the calculation of the matching conditions between regions of constant potential and time - periodic potential .",
    "in fact , one has to introduce energy sidebands and to match them individually , as it has been done in the case of a one - channel oscillating barrier to model quantum traversal times @xcite .",
