    "their values allow us to compute the following bounds for @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31              i found the sequence @xmath15 using an algorithm which proceeds as follows : given a finite sidon sequence @xmath39 , choose as @xmath40 the value that would yield the largest reciprocal sum if the sequence were continued with the greedy algorithm ; then repeat with the sequence @xmath41 .",

    "the most likely place to find a @xmath0-sequence @xmath42 achieving a reciprocal sum @xmath43 , if it exists , is between the sequences having the first 27 terms in common with @xmath15 , or with the zhang sequence .",
