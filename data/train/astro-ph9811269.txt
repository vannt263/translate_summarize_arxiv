    "indirect methods to search for extra - solar planets do not measure emission from the planet itself , but instead seek to discover and quantify the tell - tale effects that the planet would have on the position ( astrometry ) and motion ( radial velocity ) of its parent star , or on the apparent brightness of its parent star ( occultation ) or random background sources ( gravitational microlensing ) .",
    "all of these indirect signals have a characteristic temporal behavior that aids in the discrimination between planetary effects and other astrophysical causes .",
    "the variability can be due to the changing position of the planet with respect to the parent star ( astrometry , radial velocity , occultation ) , or the changing position of the complete planetary system with respect to background stars ( microlensing ) .",
    "the time - variable photometric signals that can be measured using occultation and microlensing techniques are the focus of this small series of lectures .",
    "an occultation is the temporary dimming of the apparent brightness of a parent star that occurs when a planet transits the stellar disk ; this can occur only when the orbital plane is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky . because the planet is considerably cooler than its parent star ,",
    "its surface brightness at optical and infrared wavelengths is less , causing a dip in the stellar light curve whenever the planet ( partially ) eclipses the star . since the fractional change in brightness is proportional to the fraction of the stellar surface subtended by the planetary disk , photometric measurements directly yield a measure of the planet s size . for small terrestrial planets ,",
    "the effect is simply to occult a fraction of the stellar light ; the atmospheres of larger gaseous planets may also cause absorption features that can be measured during transit with high resolution , very high s / n spectroscopic monitoring .",
    "the duration of a transit is a function of the size of the stellar disk and the size and inclination of the planetary orbit .",
    "together with an accurate stellar typing of the parent star , measurement of the transit duration and period provides an estimate for the radius and inclination of the planet s orbital plane .",
    "since large planets in tight orbits will create the most significant and frequent occultations , these are the easiest to detect .",
    "if hundreds of stars can be monitored with significantly better than 1% photometry , the transit method can be applied from the ground to place statistics on jupiter - mass planets in tight orbits .",
    "space - based missions , which could search for transits continuously and with higher photometric precision , may be capable of detecting earth - mass planets in earth - like environments via the occultation method .",
    "moons or multiple planets may also be detectable , not through their eclipsing effect , but by the periodic change they induce in the timing of successive transits of the primary occulting body .",
    "microlensing occurs when a foreground compact object (  a star , perhaps with orbiting planets ) moves between an observer and a luminous background source (  another star ) .",
    "the gravitational field of the foreground lens alters the path of the light from the background source , creating multiple images with a combined brightness larger than that of the unlensed background source . for stellar or planetary mass lenses ,",
    "the separation of these images is too small to be resolved , but the combined brightness of the images changes with time in a predictable manner as the lensing system moves across the sky with respect to the background source .",
    "hundreds of microlensing events have been detected in the galaxy , a large fraction of which are due to ( unseen ) stellar lenses . in binary lenses with favorable geometric configurations ,",
    "the lensing effect of the two lenses combines in a non - linear way to create detectable and rapid variations in the light curve of the background source star .",
    "modeling of these features yields estimates for the mass ratio and normalized projected orbital radius for the binary lens ; in general , smaller - mass companions produce weaker and shorter deviations .",
    "frequent , high - precision photometric monitoring of microlensing events can thus be used to discover and characterize extreme mass - ratio binaries (  planetary systems ) . with current ground - based technology , microlensing",
    "is particularly suited to the detection of jupiter - mass planets in jupiter - like environments .",
    "planets smaller than neptune will resolve the brightest background sources ( giants ) diluting the planetary signal . for planets above this mass ,",
    "the planetary detection efficiency of microlensing is a weak function of the planet s mass and includes a rather broad range in orbital radii , making it one of the best techniques for a statistical study of the frequency and nature of planetary systems in the galaxy .",
    "microlensing can discover planetary systems at distances of the galactic center and is the only technique that is capable of detecting unseen planets around _ unseen parent stars _ !",
    "these lectures begin with a discussion of the physical basis of occultation and microlensing , emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses as well as the selection effects and challenges presented by sources of confusion for the planetary signal .",
    "the techniques are then placed in the larger context of extra - solar planet detection .",
    "speculative comments about possibilities in the next decade cap the lectures .",
    "due to their small sizes and low effective temperatures , planets are difficult to detect directly . compared to stars , their luminosities are reduced by the square of the ratio of their radii ( factors of @xmath0@xmath1 in the solar system ) and the fourth power of the ratio of their effective temperatures ( factors of @xmath0@xmath2 in the solar system ) .",
    "such planets may be detected indirectly however if they chance to transit ( as viewed by the observer ) the face of their parent star and are large enough to occult a sufficient fraction of the star s flux .",
    "this method of detecting planets around other stars was discussed as early as mid - century ( sturve 1952 ) , but received serious attention only after the detailed quantification of its possibilities by rosenblatt ( 1971 ) and borucki and summers ( 1984 ) .",
    "such occultation effects have been observed for many years in the photometry of binary star systems whose orbital planes lie close enough to edge - on as viewed from earth that the disk of each partner occults the other at some point during the orbit , creating two dips in the combined light curve of the system .",
    "the depth of the observed occultation depends on the relative size and temperatures of the stars . for planetary systems ,",
    "only the dip caused by the occultation of the brighter parent star by the transit of the smaller , cooler planet will be detectable .",
    "the detection rate for a given planetary system will depend on several factors : the geometric probability that a transit will occur , the frequency and duration of the observations compared to the frequency and duration of the transit , and the sensitivity of the photometric measurements compared to the fractional deviation in the apparent magnitude of the parent star due to the planetary occultation .",
    "we consider each of these in turn .",

    "0.4 cm    unless stated otherwise in special cases below , we will assume for the purposes of discussion that planetary orbits are circular and that the surface brightness , mass , and radius of the planet are small compared to that of the parent star .",
    "we will also assume that the orbital radius is much larger than the size of the parent star itself .",
    "consider a planet of radius @xmath6 orbiting a star of radius @xmath7 and mass @xmath8 at an orbital radius @xmath4 .",
    "a transit of the stellar disk will be seen by an external observer only if the orbital plane is sufficiently inclined with respect to the sky plane ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in particular , the inclination @xmath3 must satisfy    @xmath9    since @xmath10 is simply the projection of the normal vector ( of the orbital plane ) onto the sky plane , it is equally likely to take on any random value between 0 and 1 .",
    "thus , for an ensemble of planetary systems with arbitrary orientation with respect to the observer , the probability that the inclination satisfies the geometric criterion for a transit is :    @xmath11    geometrically speaking , the occultation method favors those planets with small orbital radii in systems with large parent stars . as can be seen in fig .  2 , for planetary systems like the solar system this probability is small : @xmath12 for inner terrestrial planets and about a factor of 10 smaller for jovian gas giants .",
    "this means that unless a method can be found to pre - select stars with ecliptic planes oriented perpendicular to the plane of the sky , thousands of random stars must be monitored in order to detect statistically meaningful numbers of planetary transits due to solar systems like our own .",

    "furthermore , an accurate measurement of @xmath23 does not ensure that @xmath10 for the planetary orbital plane is known .",
    "the planets in our own solar system are misaligned by about 7  with the sun s rotational plane , a result that is similar to that found for binaries orbiting solar - type stars ( hale 1994 ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that an accurate measurement of @xmath24 will constrain the planetary orbital plane only to within @xmath010 .    to enhance probabilities , current ground - based attempts to detect transits",
    "have taken a different tack by concentrating on known eclipsing binary star systems in which the orbital plane of the binary is known to be close to edge - on . assuming that any other companions will have similarly aligned angular momentum vectors ,",
    "it is hoped that such systems will have larger than random chances of producing a transit event .",
    "the precession of orbital plane likely to be present in such systems may actually bring the planet across the face of the star more often than in single star systems ( schneider 1994 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution and dynamics of single and double star systems is so different that the formation and frequency of their planetary companions is likely to be quite different as well . in particular",
    ", it may be difficult for planets in some binary systems to maintain long - lived circular orbits and thus , perhaps , to become the birth place of life of the sort that has evolved on earth .",

    ". since the flares are generally blue , the primary problem will be in confusing the chromatic signal expected due to limb - darkening effects during a transit .",
    "more troublesome will be separating transits from irregular stellar variability due to star spots .",
    "star spots are cool regions on the stellar surface that remain for a few rotations before disappearing .",
    "they could mock a transit event and thus are probably the most important non - instrumental source of noise .",
    "although the power spectrum of the solar flux does show variations on day and sub - day time scales , most of the power during periods of sunspot maximum occurs at the approximate 1-month time scale of the sun s rotation . even during sunspot maximum",
    ", variations on day and sub - day scales are at or below the @xmath64 level ( borucki , scargle & hudson 1985 ) .",
    "star spots on solar - type stars will therefore not be confused with the transit signal of a gas giant , but spots might be a source of additional noise for terrestrial - sized planets of small orbital radius ( @xmath65au ) and for parent stars that are significantly more spotted than the sun .",
    "if the parent star can be well - characterized , the transit method involves quite simple physical principles that can perhaps be exploited further to learn more about planetary systems .",
    "for example , if a system is discovered to contain large transiting inner planets , it can be assumed to have a favorable inclination angle that would make it a good target for more sensitive searches for smaller radius or larger @xmath4 planets in the same system .",
    "if the inner giants are large enough , differential spectroscopy with a very large telescope before and during transits could reveal additional spectral lines that could be attributed to absorption of stellar light by the atmosphere of the giant ( presumably gaseous ) planet ( see laurent & schneider , this proceedings ) .",
    "a large occulting ring inclined to the observer s line - of - sight would create a transit profile of a different shape than that of a planet ( schneider 1997 ) , though the signal could be confused with limb - darkening effects and would likely be important only for outer gas giants where icy rings can form more easily .",
    "finally , variations in the ingress timing of inner planets can be used to search for cyclic variations that could betray the presence of moons ( schneider 1997 ) or  in principle  massive ( inner or outer ) planets that are nearly coplanar but too misaligned to cause a detectable transit themselves .",
    "transit timing shifts would be caused by the slight orbital motion of the planet around the planet - moon barycenter or that of the star around the system barycenter .",

    "indeed , microlensing is the only extra - solar planetary search technique that requires _ no photons from either the planet or the parent star _ and for this reason is the method most sensitive to the distant planetary systems in our galaxy .",

    "the transit method is sensitive to planets with small @xmath4 because they create a detectable transit over a wider range of inclinations of their orbital planes , and because they transit more often within a typical 5-year experiment .",

    "if improvements in photometric precision would allow the detection of earth - size planetary transits , this range would still be possible , but would suffer from noise due to star spot activity on time scales that could be confused with transits by small - mass planets with @xmath183 .    since the planets in own solar system fall roughly on the same log@xmath184-log@xmath185 relationship",

    "all three of these techniques require long - term projects to detect long - period ( large @xmath4 ) planets since the measurements of velocity , position , or flux must be collected over at least one full orbital period .",
    "the occultation threshold must be convolved with the geometric transit probability to derive efficiencies _ per observed star_.    photometric precision in crowded fields together with source resolution effects limit current microlensing planet searches to neptune masses and above .",

    "22 shows estimates of microlensing detection efficiency contours for planets of a given mass ratio and true orbital separation ( in units of the einstein radius ) .",
    "the contours are based on the work of gaudi & gould ( 1997 ) for high - mass ratios , gould & loeb ( 1992 ) and gaudi & sackett ( 1998 ) for intermediate mass ratios , and bennett & rhie ( 1996 ) for small ratios .",

    "although planets with @xmath4 in the lensing zone and orbiting in the sky plane are the easiest to detect , a tail of sensitivity extends to larger @xmath4 as well because inclination effects will bring large-@xmath4 planets into the projected lensing zone for some phases of their orbits .",

    "collaborations have issued real - time secondary alerts of anomalous behavior ( including binary lenses , source resolution , `` lensing parallax '' ) , but to date no clear detection of a lensing planet has been announced .",
    "especially if caustics are crossed , it may be possible to obtain additional information on microlensing planets from the sky motion of the caustics during the event that is induced by planetary motion ( dominik 1998 ) .",
    "the number of high - quality microlensing light curves monitored by the planet collaboration is already beginning to approach that required for reasonable jovian detection sensitivities ( albrow  1998a ) , so meaningful results on jupiter look - alikes can be expected within the next few years .",
    "as more telescopes , more telescope time , and wider - field detectors are dedicated to dense , precise photometric monitoring capable of detecting planetary transits and planetary microlensing , we can feel certain that  if jovian planets with orbital radii less than @xmath06  au exist in sufficient numbers  they will be detected in the next few years by these techniques .",
