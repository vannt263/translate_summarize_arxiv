    "single - photon detectors ( spds ) are widely used for measuring extremely weak light levels , and they are an enabling technology for biophysics , astrophysics , metrology , quantum optics and quantum information experiments . nowadays ,",
    "there exist a number of competing technologies for spds , e.g. ,  photomultipliers,@xcite superconducting nanowire devices,@xcite visible light photon counters,@xcite and avalanche photodiodes ( apds).@xcite when it comes to real - world applications , however , apds are the most practical choice due to their good characteristics at relatively lower cost .    silicon ( si ) apds are most often used in order to detect single photons in the visible and near - infrared wavelength range up to @xmath4.@xcite photon detection by si apds at longer wavelengths is also possible , enabled by efficient wavelength conversion to the above range.@xcite    commercial spds based on si apds are available with dark count rates in tens to hundreds @xmath5 range.@xcite selected detector modules with extremely low dark count rates ( below @xmath6 ) are also available , however they have a very small photosensitive area ( @xmath7@xmath8 in diameter ) and low photon detection efficiency in the near - infrared wavelength range ( @xmath7@xmath9 at @xmath10).@xcite however , detectors with a very low dark count rate at a high ( @xmath1150% ) photon detection efficiency can be important for a number of experiments and applications.@xcite    in this paper , we report a lab - assembled spd that exhibits dark count rates of only about @xmath0 .",
    "our spd is based on perkinelmer c30902sh or c30921sh apds,@xcite supplemented with our own electronics and cooling assembly .",
    "these apds have a large input aperture ( diameter of sensitive area @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) and high quantum efficiency in the 600900@xmath14 wavelength range .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the design of our lab - assembled spds , characterize them thoroughly , then compare their performance to that of commercial spds .",
    "we assembled several spds and tested nine apd samples : eight in window package ( referred to as c30902sh-@xmath15 , where @xmath15 is the sample number ) and one in light - pipe package ( c30921sh ) .",
    "each apd was mounted on a thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) .",
    "we used 3-stage tec ( thermonamic tec3 - 71 - 31 - 17 - 03 ) to reach temperatures down to @xmath16 , and 4-stage tec ( kryotherm tb-4-(83 - 18 - 4 - 1)-1.3 ) for lower temperatures .",
    "the tec - apd assembly was mounted ( using a thermally - conductive epoxy ) inside an aluminum - alloy housing with an anti - reflection coated window .",
    "on the outside , the housing was mated with a low thermal resistance fan - cooled heatsink ( noctua nh - u12p ) to keep the tec hot plate close to the room temperature . in order to minimize heat flow to the cold plate , electrical connections to the apd and temperature sensor ( miniature thermistor , rmt ltd .",
    "tb04 ) were made with @xmath17 diameter platinum wires , allowing easy manual soldering .",
    "furthermore , to reduce the heat flow via air convection , the tec - apd assembly was tightly surrounded with cut - to - shape styrofoam ( of ordinary type commonly found in , e.g. ,  shipping packaging material for consumer electronics ) . to prevent ice formation at the cold plate ,",
    "the housing was sealed with rubber o - rings to keep it air - tight , and a small bag of strong desiccant was placed inside . for desiccant , we used calcium sulfate @xmath18-anhydrite ( drierite ) which worked well down to at least @xmath16 , and p@xmath19o@xmath20 ( sicapent ) for lower temperatures at the cold plate .     resistor . during an avalanche ,",
    "the @xmath21 stray capacitance quickly discharges through the apd .",
    "the discharge current is converted into voltage at the @xmath22 resistor , and this voltage is sensed by a fast comparator ( ecl differential receiver mc100el16 ) . when the voltage at the apd drops sufficiently close to the breakdown voltage , the avalanche quenches .",
    "electrical signal shapes in the circuit are shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] +    we use a simple and robust passively - quenched detector circuit.@xcite it consists of a high - voltage power supply , @xmath23 bias resistor ( placed close to the apd inside the hermetic housing ) , high - speed comparator sensing the onset of avalanche , and pulse width extender ( fig .",
    "[ quenching]).@xcite the circuit works owing to the presence of a stray capacitance of about @xmath24 between the cathode of the apd and the ground . during the avalanche ,",
    "this capacitance quickly discharges through the @xmath22 resistor , causing a short voltage pulse detected by a fast comparator .",
    "detector electronics also contains a tec controller that maintains a set temperature of the apd.@xcite",
    "+    we set the apd temperature @xmath25 and bias voltage @xmath26 with two trimpots .",
    "the tunability of @xmath26 is required because the breakdown voltage @xmath27 increases with temperature .",
    "figure  [ v_break ] shows that @xmath27 depends on @xmath25 linearly with a coefficient ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for different apd samples .",
    "de measured at other temperatures in the @xmath31 to @xmath32 range is very similar .",
    "all measurements were performed at @xmath3 , except for c30902sh-4 which was characterized at @xmath33 .",
    "the error bars shown are @xmath34 of the measured de value , which is the estimated maximum total error taking into account all calibration and measurement inaccuracies at @xmath35",
    ". data at @xmath36 was not measured because the avalanche pulse amplitude fell below the relatively high threshold of our comparator , set to avoid spurious counts from electrical interference .",
    "the dashed portions of the curves at @xmath37 are lower than the actual de due to self - sustained avalanches , see fig .  [ a - quenching ] and discussion in the text . the drop of dc at @xmath38 is due to the same effect.,title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] +    for characterization of our lab - assembled spds , we measured the photon detection efficiency ( de ) and dark count rate ( dc ) as a function of overbias voltage @xmath39 .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath40 is obtained by measuring the count rate @xmath41 at a certain incoming photon rate @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is continuous - wave ( c.w . )",

    "we measured a maximum de of @xmath52 at @xmath53 overbias .",
    "a de of @xmath54 at @xmath55 overbias gives a possible trade - off between high de and low dc .",
    "we remark that de could be further increased slightly by decapsulating the apd package , whose entrance window is not anti - reflection coated .",

    "( latching current , @xmath59).@xcite the self - quenching happens because at a sufficiently low current , the number of carriers in the junction would randomly fluctuate to zero . in a self - sustaning avalanching condition ,",
    "voltage at the apd drops to about @xmath27 , thus the steady - state apd current equals @xmath60 . to achieve self - quenching ,",
    "the bias resistor has to be sufficiently large and @xmath50 sufficiently low such that the steady - state current is lower than the latching current .",
    "we use @xmath23 bias resistor , which allows the avalanche to self - quench quickly at @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ a - quenching ] shows oscillograms of voltage across the apd when @xmath50 is @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as can be seen , all avalanches self - quench within a few @xmath64 at the lower overbias voltage , whereas they self - sustain for a long time at the higher overbias , randomly extending the detector deadtime with a concomitant drop in measured de and dc .",
    "although using a larger bias resistor and @xmath37 could possibly result in a higher de , we have noticed an uncontrolled rise of dark counts at @xmath65 , and did not further investigate apd performance at those voltages .",
    "the remaining measurements in this paper are taken at @xmath66 , and are thus not affected by the avalanche self - sustaining behavior .    while de in our measurement is insensitive of @xmath25 , dc increases exponentially with temperature ( fig .",
    "[ dark_count ] ) .",
    "on average , one can expect dc to halve for each @xmath67 decrease in temperature . at @xmath1 , we observed @xmath68 for the best sample , and @xmath69 for the worst one .",
    "we remark that temperatures down to @xmath70 can easily be achieved with a single - stage tec .",
    "for each temperature and sample .",
    "dc drops exponentially with decreasing temperature.,title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] +      beyond the useful photon - counting range where the count rate grows linearly with optical illumination , passively - quenched spds exhibit saturation and blinding behavior.@xcite in case of our detectors , saturation starts at optical power above @xmath71 and the count rate peaks at @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ saturation ] ) .",
    "the spds become completely blind to single photons above @xmath73 .",
    "these saturation and blinding curves are similar to other passively - quenched spds.@xcite     and eventually drops to exactly zero under yet brighter illumination .",
    "measurements were done at @xmath16 and @xmath74.,title=\"fig:\",width=316 ] +      because of the relatively long deadtime of passively - quenched spds , afterpulsing is usually not as significant as with actively - quenched modules.@xcite however , since afterpulsing is known to increase as @xmath25 decreases,@xcite we have estimated afterpulsing probabilities of our lab - assembled spds at low temperatures . in order to measure them ,",
    "we have measured the autocorrelation function @xmath75 under complete darkness by following the time - correlated single - photon counting method.@xcite usually for this purpose , @xmath76 is measured under dim c.w.@xcite or pulsed light.@xcite assuming @xmath76 of photon counts is identical to that of dark counts , the latter is simpler to measure .",
    "also it is more precise than under c.w .",
