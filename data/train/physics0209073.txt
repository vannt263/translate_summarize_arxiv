    "the method employed is primitive fpi as applied to the quadratic potential . ]",
    "as we said in the beginning of this section , for numerical purposes it is convenient to study the convergence of the t - method energy estimator in the virial form , which can be computed by monte carlo integration .",
    "as we explain below , the numerical study of the asymptotic behavior is not a computationally easy task , especially for those methods that have rapid asymptotic convergence .",
    "more explicitly , let us take a look at the following analog of  ( [ eq:31 ] ) : @xmath175 where @xmath176 for the partial averaging method , we suggested that the difference @xmath177 decays to zero as fast as  @xmath178 . in turn , the differences @xmath179 between consecutive terms decay to zero",
    "as fast as  @xmath180 .",
    "it is thus clear that faster rates of convergence of the method require greater precision in the evaluation of the terms @xmath181 .",
    "if we assume an independent sampling of the probability density shown in formula  ( [ eq:24 ] ) , the error in the monte carlo evaluation of @xmath181 is @xmath182 , where  @xmath154 is the number of monte carlo sampling points and @xmath183 is the standard deviation .",
    "this error should satisfy the inequality : @xmath184 it follows that the number of monte carlo points necessary to insure a given relative error for @xmath185 scales at least as badly as @xmath186 as a function of the number of fourier coefficients .",
    "the same is true for rw - fpi , while for the primitive fpi we only need @xmath187 .",
    "we emphasize that this scaling is related to our immediate task of establishing the asymptotic rates of convergence and is not an issue that would arise in typical numerical applications .",
    "the second observation we make is that the ratio @xmath188 increases as the temperature is dropped .",
    "consequently , we would like to conduct our model computations at low temperature , where the quantum effects are big enough so that the differences between consecutive terms are significant . at high temperature ,",
    "the classical limit is a good approximation and these differences may be smaller than the statistical errors we are able to achieve .",
    "we are therefore forced to conduct our computations in the `` unfavorable '' range of temperatures , and in general , we need to study groundstate problems .",
    "we hope this is enough rationale to justify the need for a special monte carlo integration scheme capable of accurately sampling the low temperature distributions with good efficiency and low correlation , at least for certain classes of simpler systems .",
    "one such scheme is discussed in appendix  e , and it generally applies to the class of single - well potentials .    for comparison purposes , we shall also compute the t - estimator energies for the trapezoidal trotter method .",
    "expressions similar to those presented here for the fpi methods were deduced by coalson@xcite and employed by mielke and truhlar@xcite as the tt - fpi method .",
    "we shall keep this name in the present paper , though , as defined here , the tt - fpi approach is _ not _ an fpi method because the @xmath38-th order partial sum  @xmath66 is not the one for the primitive fpi .",
    "the importance of this method consists of the fact that its asymptotic rate of convergence is  @xmath15 for smooth enough potentials , being the fastest primitive method to date that leaves the potential unchanged.@xcite we do not present this scheme in the present paper and for further information we refer the reader to the cited literature .",
    "the prototype system studied in this work is the quartic potential @xmath189 .",
    "we set @xmath190 and @xmath120 and @xmath191 .",
    "the groundstate of the quartic potential was evaluated by variational methods to be @xmath192 , while the average energy at the temperature corresponding to @xmath193 is @xmath194 .",
    "we computed the average energy for the sequence @xmath128 with @xmath195 , corresponding to the actual numbers of fourier coefficients @xmath196 . in these calculations ,",
    "the number of points employed in the gauss - legendre quadrature scheme was @xmath197 .",
    "we used @xmath198 monte carlo points for primitive fpi , @xmath199 for tt - fpi , @xmath200 points for rw - fpi , and @xmath201 points for pa - fpi calculations , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath202 were previously computed in a quarter of these numbers during a `` warm - up '' period , but we continued to improve them during the main monte carlo procedure .",
    "table  [ tab : ii ] of appendix  f summarizes the results of the computer evaluations .",
    "the differences between successive energy terms were computed with the help of the estimator  ( [ eq:46 ] ) .",
    "the errors were computed with the help of the formulae  ( [ eq:40 ] ) for the average energies , and  ( [ eq:48 ] ) for the estimated differences .",
    "the straight lines drawn represent the linear least square fit for the last four data .",
    "their slopes give the convergence exponents for each method . ]",
    "fig  4 shows the behavior of the functions  @xmath203 for the four methods . among the non - averaged methods , we remark that the primitive fpi approach reaches its asymptotic behavior faster than the tt - fpi method , which in turn reaches its asymptotic region faster than the rw - fpi technique . this behavior is shown in fig  5 , which plots the current slope  @xmath204 .",
    "although the rw - fpi method did not reach its final asymptotic behavior , the trend is clear .",
    "the computed convergence exponents using the last four data points are : @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the asymptotic convergence of the methods is @xmath14 for pa - fpi and rw - fpi , @xmath15 for tt - fpi , and @xmath13 for primitive fpi .     the current slopes for each method should ideally converge to  @xmath209 for pa - fpi and rw - fpi , @xmath126 for tt - fpi , and @xmath210 for primitive fpi .",
    "lastly , it is worth comparing the convergence constants for the pa - fpi and rw - fpi methods since they have the same asymptotic convergence exponent .",
    "the numerical values are @xmath211 and @xmath212 , showing that the pa - fpi method is over  @xmath213 times faster than the rw - fpi method .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations made for the partition function of the harmonic oscillator in the previous section .",
    "the pa speed - up of the convergence is important , especially with respect to minimizing the number of path variables required in practical applications .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the best series representation ( with respect to asymptotic convergence ) for use in monte carlo path integral methods is the wiener sine - fourier series . both the rw - fpi and tt - fpi methods are not series representations and we suggest that the latter also falls in the category of reweighting techniques . the partial averaging technique has the asymptotic convergence @xmath14 , with a small convergence constant and it is the best way of improving the asymptotic behavior of the primitive fpi method ( at the cost of computing the gaussian transform of the potential ) .",
    "the tt - fpi and rw - fpi methods increase the order of convergence of the primitive fpi to @xmath15 , and @xmath14 , respectively , without increasing the variance of the corresponding estimators .",
    "it should be noted that , unlike the complete partial averaging approach , the reweighting method does not require the gaussian transform of the potential .",
    "while a final decision awaits detailed future studies , we anticipate that this latter feature of the reweighting approach will be beneficial for applications where the gaussian transform is either formally ill - posed and/or computationally difficult to obtain .",
    "finally , as discussed in appendix  e , the first and the second - order estimators also improve the asymptotic convergence .",
    "although both have larger variances , the first order estimator appears computationally feasible since its variance decreases with the number of fourier coefficients .",

    "this implies that for a fixed but large number of monte carlo points  @xmath154 , the error in  ( [ eq:48 ] ) has the asymptotic behavior @xmath350    the importance of  ( [ eq:52 ] ) is twofold .",

    "\\approx \\text{err}_s ( n , e_{4n+2}^{t , mt})+ \\frac{4\\cdot const}{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\sqrt{n } } \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this readily implies that the use of the estimators of order one and two does _ not _ change the scaling of the number of monte carlo points needed to achieve a given error threshold for the estimated energy with the number of fourier coefficients .",
    "the net result is an improvement in the asymptotic behavior for the estimators of order one and two .",
    "however , in the case of the second - order estimator , we notice an increase in the variance of the estimator which may be quite large for practical purposes . for the first - order estimator _ there is no asymptotic increase in the variance _",
    ", which makes it more suitable for practical applications .",
    "in fact , the first - order estimator may also be used for potentials that do not have continuous second - order derivatives but for which the decay with the number of fourier coefficients implied by  ( [ eq:52 ] ) can be replaced by the slower one @xmath356 finally , in the cases where it can not be utilized as an energy estimator because of an unduly large variance , the correction term brought in by the first - order estimator is still useful as a measure of how far the zero - order estimator is from the true result .",
    "the reader may work out the expression for the estimator of order three and see that in this case the scaling is changed .",
