    "the temperature of an equilibrium system is calculated from the mean kinetic energy of its particles .",
    "however , rugh @xcite has recently derived a new expression whose average yields the temperature in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the derivation involves the differentiation of the phase space volume of the ensemble ( whose logarithm gives the entropy ) with respect to the energy .",
    "the resultant expression depends not only on the momenta of the particles , but also on their ( spatial ) configuration .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the temperature of a system effects the configurations adopted by that system , and consequently one would expect to be able to calculate the temperature from configurational as well as kinetic information",
    ".    in @xcite , a completely configurational version of rugh s result was derived , and applied to monte carlo simulations , where the equipartition theorem can not be used since only the configurational degrees of freedom are considered @xcite .",
    "not only did the temperature indeed correspond to the input temperature , but it was found to be a useful diagnostic for revealing coding errors as well . in @xcite , rugh s result was applied to the non - equilibrium domain , as an alternative means of defining the local temperature .",
    "as such , it correctly accounted for heat fluxes where the kinetic temperature failed to do so .",
    "these applications have required extensions of rugh s original work . in this paper",

    "atomistic simulations are usually conducted under periodic boundary conditions .",

    "thus the ensembles explored by md simulations are not the full microcanonical or canonical ensembles , but subsets of these ( the `` md ensembles '' ) .",

    "we note immediately the dimensional inconsistency of this expression . from a physical point of view",

    "if the primitive cell of the periodic system is the same size and shape as the bounded system , then @xmath15 will be the same in both cases .",
    "the difference between the bounded and periodic systems is that particles can not pass through the walls of the bounded system .",
    "this implies that the energy at the walls is infinite , so that our surfaces of constant energy lie entirely _ within _ @xmath15 , and do not pass through the boundary , which we denote @xmath58 .",
    "this assumption is implicit in our application of gauss theorem .    in the periodic system , particles _",

    "there is an equivalent system where this particle is placed on the `` opposite '' wall of the primitive cell , represented by @xmath70 .",

    "the entropy will still correspond to the phase space volume , except that this volume is now @xmath79 dimensional .",
    "however , we can only apply gauss theorem to the projection of the vector field @xmath80 onto @xmath74 .",
    "alternatively we must select @xmath8 so that it lies entirely in @xmath74 .",
    "such a @xmath8 must satisfy the condition that @xmath81 . in this case , eq .",

    "we now move on to a proof of eq .",
    "( [ emget : gen ] ) in the canonical ensemble , starting with the bounded case .",
    "we invoke gauss theorem over @xmath82 for an arbitrary vector field in phase space @xmath83 ( where we assume a finite , positive @xmath84 ) , ie @xmath85 in the limit as @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 for eq .",
    "( [ emget : can1 ] ) to be of any use , we require that the two integrals on the right hand side be finite . for the latter integral",

    "thus the conditions for eq .",

    "( [ emget : can1 ] ) becomes @xmath95 we have already seen that the integral over @xmath25 must go to zero in order for @xmath96 to exist , so we simply require that @xmath97 however , via the properties of the laplace transform we have that @xmath98 therefore the condition under which eq .",

    "( [ emget : can2 ] ) will hold in the canonical ensemble as long as @xmath8 is periodic in @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we consider the canonical md ensemble . as with the microcanonical md ensemble , our application of gauss theorem requires that @xmath8 lie in @xmath74 , so we again require that @xmath81 for eq .",
    "( [ emget : can2 ] ) to hold in the canonical md ensemble .",
    "thus the conditions for eq .",
    "( [ emget : gen ] ) to hold for the periodic boundary system and the `` md ensembles '' are the same in both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles .",
    "having proven eq .  ( [ emget : gen ] ) in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles , and found the conditions for it to hold in systems with periodic boundary conditions and the md ensembles , we now demonstrate its use in generating expressions whose phase space average yields the system temperature .",
    "if we choose @xmath99 , so that only the @xmath100-th component is non - zero , then we obtain @xmath101 this is the familiar generalised equipartition theorem .",
    "if @xmath102 is a momentum , then we obtain the equipartition theorem , @xmath103 .",
    "if it is a coordinate , then we obtain the lesser known clausius virial theorem , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the generalised force acting on coordinate @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we note that the clausius virial theorem gives a function of coordinates only , whose average is the temperature of the system .",
    "however , the function @xmath106 is not periodic in @xmath15 in this case , so that this theorem does _ not _ hold for periodic systems .",
    "it is therefore of little use to practitioners of most md simulations as a means of calculating the temperature .    if we select an arbitrary vector field @xmath107 , and choose @xmath108 then for _ all _ choices of @xmath107 , @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath110 providing this average exists . substituting @xmath111 , we obtain rugh s final equation @xcite .",

    "values of these six temperatures were calculated for the 3d microcanonical simulation of a periodic wca system at various sizes @xmath1 , reduced number densities @xmath160 , and reduced total energies per particle @xmath161 .",
    "they were determined by the average of ten separate simulations , each of 200000 timesteps ( of @xmath162 ) .",
    "the errors associated with each temperature were given by one third of the maximum deviation from the average over these ten runs .",
    "the first comparison was made between systems with the same density and size , but differing energies .",
    "the values of the equipartition and normal temperatures ( @xmath163 , @xmath131 , @xmath133 and @xmath151 ) were calculated for a system of 500 particles with reduced density @xmath164 , and reduced energies per particle ranging from @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "these values appear in table [ energies ] .",
    "the four temperatures agree to within 0.60.8% of the equipartition temperature over the range of energies shown .",
    "the values for the three configurational temperatures match the corresponding normal temperatures to within 0.01% , ie to the number of digits shown in table [ energies ] .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the kinetic and configuration terms in the numerator and denominator of the normal temperature expressions . at high densities ,",
    "the configuration terms are much larger than those contributed by the momentum terms  in two dimensions , this is typically a difference of four orders of magnitude , and in three dimensions , the difference is about six orders of magnitude .",
    "for this reason , the value of the normal temperature can be considered as a `` perturbation '' to the corresponding configurational temperature which has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "it is interesting to note , given this dependence on the physical structure of the system rather than on its momentum distribution , that the normal and configurational temperature expressions yield the correct temperature across the solid - liquid phase transition , despite the difference in the microscopic arrangements of atoms on either side of the transition temperature .    in fig .",

    "however , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath151 must converge to the other two normal temperatures .",
    "this result indicates that , while @xmath151 and @xmath131 must converge towards the thermodynamic temperature , irrespective of the density , larger systems sizes are required for the same degree of convergence of @xmath151 as the density drops .",

    "this is a result of the drop in the number of particle interactions per timestep at lower densities .",
    "when the number of these interactions is reduced , the configurational contributions do not dominate the kinetic contributions as they do in the high density regime .",
    "consequently , the inclusion of kinetic terms ( which , by themselves would produce a value within 0.1% of the equipartition value ) in @xmath151 will always correct @xmath152 towards the equipartition value .    to further examine the system size dependence of our temperature expressions",
