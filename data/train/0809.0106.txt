    "the study of interfaces is often used to investigate the stability of ordered coexisting phases .",
    "low temperature ordered phases are spatially homogeneous , however , interfaces can be induced by forcing heterogeneous boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of phases characterized by different values of an order parameter , one can fix the order parameter at the boundaries along one selected direction to two different values . for stable phases",
    "the induced interface costs an amount of free - energy proportional to a power of the interface size . at the lower critical dimension this power vanishes and long - range order becomes unstable .    in spin glasses , due to the lack of a physical order parameter allowing to distinguish the different phases , this definition of an interface does not seem of practical use .",
    "different proposals have been put forward to define interfaces in spin glasses .",
    "a common procedure @xcite , involves the comparison of free - energies between systems with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "this leads to a definition of an interface exponent , from the relation : @xmath0 which plays a fundamental rle in the droplet picture of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "measures of @xmath1 have been used to perform a high - precision estimate of the spin - glass lower critical dimension @xmath2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( defined as the value of @xmath3 for which the interface exponent @xmath1 vanishes ) .",
    "an alternative definition @xcite uses the free - energy cost that is needed to impose a spatial heterogeneity in the order parameter , which in spin glasses is the overlap , i.e. a measure of the similarity between two equilibrated configurations of the same system @xcite . one",
    "needs to consider two identical copies of the system constrained in such a way to have their mutual overlaps on the boundaries fixed to some preassigned values .",
    "this definition is well suited to test an important property emerging in the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) of the spin - glass phase : while the probability distribution @xmath4 for the overlap is broad ",
    "although having noticeable tails for finite systems  reduces to two delta functions in the thermodynamic limit . ] , reflecting the presence of many different and almost degenerate equilibrium phases , one has that for any couple of equilibrated configurations their mutual overlap is spatially homogeneous on a large scale .",
    "two configurations with a given value of the overlap in a given macroscopic portion of space will have the same overlap everywhere .",
    "starting from this observation a pair of identical systems subject to `` twisted overlap '' boundary conditions was considered in @xcite .",
    "two different values @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the overlap were imposed on the two boundaries along a selected direction , chosen among the ones with non - zero probability density in the @xmath4 .",
    "it was then argued , that if rsb is present , the boundaries induce a smooth overlap profile in space that interpolates between the two values . above the lower critical dimension @xmath7 for spin - glass order this has a diverging free - energy cost , and one can expect the following scaling with @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10 where the exponent @xmath11 is positive for @xmath12 . a mean - field calculation of @xmath13 and the interface exponent @xmath14 gave the non - trivial values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "remarkably , while measuring a quite different property , the resulting value of the lower critical dimension is in very good agreement with the one estimated by the periodic - antiperiodic boundary condition method @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , despite its potentially informative content on the nature of the spin - glass phase , the definition of @xcite was never used in numerical studies of the spin - glass phase .",
    "this is probably due to the difficulty of imposing values of the overlap at the boundaries .    in this paper",
    "we start from the general observation , in fact not at all specific to spin glasses , that it is possible to induce interfaces with an alternative procedure",
    ". one can divide the physical system into two contiguous halves and impose fixed values to the bulk order parameters in each of the two halves .",
    "this procedure , theoretically equivalent to fixing heterogeneous boundary conditions , is better suited for numerical investigations , since the resulting free - energy cost can be related to the probability of a spontaneous fluctuation in an unconstrained system .    in the case of spin glasses we have to consider two real replicas and impose values @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 of their mutual overlaps in two contiguous half spaces .",
    "this way of imposing heterogeneity in the system induces an overlap profile in space equal to the one induced by fixing the overlap on the boundaries to suitable values @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one then has a free - energy cost @xmath19 of the form ( [ uno ] ) with the same exponents @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the free - energy cost for imposing the different overlaps is related by boltzmann s relation to the probability that a spontaneous fluctuation of a couple of unconstrained systems produce the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the overlaps in the two half spaces : @xmath20 , which is a large deviation formula .",
    "this quantity has the advantage that it is easily accessible in numerical simulations and therefore we base our analysis on it .",
    "in this paper we focus our attention on overlap interfaces in dyson - like hierarchical spin - glass models .",
    "hierarchical models without disorder @xcite have played an important rle in the theoretical and mathematical understanding of critical points @xcite . in the ferromagnetic dyson model",
    "one can write exact renormalization group equations that involve the iteration of a function of a single variable ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "hierarchical spin - glass models of the dyson kind have not to our knowledge been considered in the literature and are in our opinion very attractive as they could allow for an analytical study of non - mean - field disordered critical points and nontrivial low temperature phases .",
    "these models provide a hierarchical version of spin glasses with power - law interactions introduced in @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional models with power - law interactions have recently received a great deal of attention as test grounds for theoretical ideas about finite - range spin - glass phases @xcite . here , following dyson , we propose to use the tree topology as a further simplification . we choose to start the study of these models focusing on interface properties , for which we can get particularly simple theoretical predictions in the rsb framework .",
    "we study the system through the replica method , deriving a recursion equation relating the replica partition functions at the different levels of the hierarchy .",
    "this relation , which in principle codes for all the thermodynamic properties of the system is analyzed in a self - consistent way to obtain the interface free - energy .",
    "we test our prediction in numerical simulations , finding good agreement .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : general ] we discuss the definition of the interfaces and how in principle interfaces can be evaluated and some expectations based on rsb theory .",
    "section [ sec : hierarchical ] is devoted to the definition of the models we use . in section [ sec : interfaces ] we discuss possible scenarios and expectations and in section [ sec : derivation ] we sketch the theoretical derivation of the interface free - energy cost in hierarchical models . section [ sec : numerics ] discusses the numerical simulations .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] concludes the paper . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the numerical characterization of the critical point .",
    "in this section we define the probability distribution of overlaps in contiguous half spaces and discuss how it can be computed in principle in the large deviation regime . for definiteness",

    "the exponent @xmath38 represents an interface free - energy cost to maintain the constrained values . in this regime ,",
    "the large deviation functional can be expected to be self - averaging and one needs to compute the average free - energy @xmath39 the rsb implies that if one chooses @xmath40 in the domain where @xmath4 is non - zero , then @xmath41 .",
    "the property of homogeneity of the overlap should then translate in a form for @xmath19 of the kind @xmath42 .    from the complete knowledge of the joint distribution ( [ joint ] ) one can in principle extract the marginal distribution of the difference @xmath43 @xmath44 in the large deviation regime , where this analysis is supposed to be valid , we have @xmath45 for @xmath46 and hence the integral should be dominated by the value of @xmath47 that maximizes the function @xmath48 . as a consequence @xmath49 , the pdf of @xmath50 , should behave as @xmath51 in the tails . in order to understand the behavior for `` small '' values of @xmath50 we can suppose a smooth cross - over between the small and the large fluctuation regimes . in this case the form ( [ log ] ) suggests a finite probability for @xmath52 , i.e. , a scaling form @xmath53 and the marginal probability of the difference @xmath43 , @xmath54 .",
    "this quantity @xmath49 is particularly easily accessible in numerical simulations and contains the the information on the ratio between the interface exponents .",
    "the comparison of this method with the study of the overlap correlation function @xcite , as well as the comparison of our analytic results in section 5 with pertubative calculations @xcite will be not attempted in this paper .",

    "we will consider two families of models , a first one that is better suited for analytic studies and a second one that is more adapted to numerical simulations . in both families",

    "does not hold @xcite .",
    "it is possible to show , using the fact that the critical theory is described by a cubic action analogous to the one for short - range spin glasses @xcite , that the various quantities scale according to the following : @xmath191 the exponent @xmath192 in the scaling functions can be derived from dimensional analysis from the cubic action .",
    "the exponent @xmath193 takes the value @xmath194 independently of @xmath63 as can be checked from the scaling relation @xmath195 with @xmath196 .",

    "to analyze the data we observe the following procedure : we first estimate the critical temperature from the crossing point of the binder parameter and the rescaled values , especially , @xmath197 and @xmath198 since these provide for a cleaner crossing than the binder parameter .",

    "the crossing of the binder parameter indicates @xmath201 and as shown in figure [ fig6 ] for @xmath153 , we obtain consistent scaling assuming the form ( [ sc ] ) and not ( [ noncl ] ) ."
