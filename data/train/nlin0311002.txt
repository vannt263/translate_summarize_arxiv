    "discrete breathers ( dbs ) are classical , spatially localized , time - periodic , numerically exact solutions which can be sustained by many non - linear lattices  @xcite .",
    "their existence , which is proven by rigorous theorems  @xcite and a large amount of numerical results , is not restricted to special or integrable models . on the contrary , they can be found , in principle , in any discrete , nonlinear system and in any dimension @xcite .",
    "they have been observed in experiments involving different systems , as josephson - junctions arrays @xcite , waveguide arrays @xcite , molecular crystals @xcite and antiferromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "they are also thought to play an important role in dna denaturation @xcite .",
    "usually they are pinned to the lattice but under certain circumstances may become highly mobile @xcite . in this case ,",
    "an interesting problem arises : the interaction between moving discrete breathers ( mbs ) and local inhomogeneities .",
    "this problem has been addressed within different frameworks : scattering of breathers or solitons by impurities  @xcite , by lattice junctions  @xcite and by bending points  @xcite of a given chain .",
    "vacancies in a crystal are another type of local inhomogeneities . by using numerical methods , some of the authors found that a localized energy packet in the form of a moving discrete breather can put a vacancy into movement  @xcite . this vacancy migration induced by localized excitations had already been suggested as an explanation for some experimental results  @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to find an explanation to the somehow qualitative results established in @xcite .",
    "the main result is that vacancies mobility is highly dependent on the existence and stability of the breathers adjacent to the vacancy , hereafter called vacancy breathers ( vbs ) .",
    "the simplest way to model a vacancy in a crystal consists in considering a one - dimensional chain of interacting particles submitted to a periodic substrate potential . it is known in other context as the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model  @xcite . a vacancy can be represented by an empty well of the substrate potential as fig .  1 shows .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is  @xcite @xmath0 being @xmath1 the absolute coordinate of the @xmath2-th particle .",
    "we have chosen the sine - gordon potential @xmath3\\ ] ] as the simplest periodic , substrate potential , with linear frequency normalized to the unity @xmath4 .",
    "we have chosen the morse potential for the interaction between particles because its force weakens as the distance between particles grows and its hard part prevents the particles from crossing .",
    "it is given by @xmath5 ^ 2.\\]]the parameter @xmath6 is the curvature of the morse potential .",
    "we have taken @xmath7 in order that mbs exist in this system for a breather frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the strength of the interaction potential can be modulated , without changing its curvature , by varying @xmath9 , being @xmath10 a measure of the well width and @xmath11 the well depth .",
    "we have also normalized the lattice period @xmath12 and the masses to the unity .",
    "the dynamical equations are given by @xmath13=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : dyn}\\ ] ]    in this system , it is possible to generate dbs numerically using the standard methods from the anticontinuous limit  @xcite .",
    "we can also induce translational motion of dbs by using a simplified form of the marginal mode method  @xcite .",
    "it consists of adding a perturbation @xmath14 to the velocities of the stationary breather , with the nonzero values at the neighboring sites of the initial breather center .",
    "the resulting db kinetics is very smooth and resembles that of a classical free particle with constant velocity .",
    "therefore , we can consider the total energy of a mb as the sum of a the internal energy , equal to the one of the stationary breather , plus the translational energy , equal to the energy of the perturbation added @xmath15 .    in order to facilitate systematic studies ,",
    "we have introduced dissipation at the boundaries .",
    "in order to investigate vacancy mobility , we have generated dbs far from a vacancy and then launched this breather against it .",
    "our numerical calculations show that the outcome of the scattering is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "the incident breather can be reflected , trapped or transmitted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : edp1v ] ) , always losing energy as it occurs in the interaction between a mb and an impurity  @xcite , whereas the vacancy can either move forward or backward or remain at rest .",
    "this scenario is very different to the one arising in the continuum limit where the vacancy ( anti - kink ) always moves backwards and the breather is always transmitted after the collision .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     ) to move a double vacancy . ]",
    "we have observed numerically the interaction of moving breathers with vacancies in the simplest , physically consistent model .",
    "we have found that the breathers can be reflected , transmitted and trapped , both by the single and the double vacancy .",
    "the single vacancy can move forward , backwards and remain and rest , but the double vacancy can not move forward , instead it can split into two single vacancies , one at rest and the other moving forwards . this phenomenology is very different from the continuous analogue , where the breather is always transmitted and the vacancy ( anti - kink ) always moves backwards .    the vacancy migration is strongly correlated with the existence and stability of vacancy breathers , which we have studied in detail . in order to move the vacancy the interaction has to be strong enough and the energy of the incident mb has to be above a threshold .",
    "this threshold disappears approximately around bifurcation points where vacancy breathers become unstable .",
    "we think that the study of the properties of breathers next to a defect may help to understand the mobility of other class of point defects such as interstitials , which might be related with recent defect migration observed experimentally in ion - irradiated silicon .",
