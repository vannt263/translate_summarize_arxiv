    "anomalies arise if the symmetries of the lagrangian at the classical level are not supported by the quantized theory after renormalization , resulting in so - called anomalous ward identities @xcite . for the case of chiral @xmath11 ,",
    "the constraints due to the anomalous ward identities have efficiently been taken care of through the effective wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) action @xcite .",
    "the wzw action is expressed in terms of the pseudoscalar octet of goldstone bosons and contributes at @xmath12 in the momentum expansion of chiral perturbation theory @xcite ( for an overview see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",

    "the width of the decay @xmath17 is predicted absolutely without reference to the number of colors .",
    "the conclusion from their analysis is that one should rather consider three - flavor processes such as @xmath18 or @xmath19 to test the expected @xmath14 dependence @xcite in a low - energy reaction .",
