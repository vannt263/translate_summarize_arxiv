    "the fraction of galaxies morphologically classified as s0 ( @xmath0 ) increases by a factor of @xmath8 in galaxy groups and clusters over the past @xmath9  gyr , at the expense of the spiral fraction @xcite .",
    "this evolution has generally been interpreted as the result of the transformation of spirals into s0 s within dense environments ( @xcite , hereafter f00 ; @xcite , hereafter d07 ) , although the physical mechanism remains undetermined . as highlighted by @xcite",
    ", the relationship between morphologies and environment can help distinguish between hypothesized formation mechanisms for s0 s .",
    "as practiced , this effort involves tracing galaxy populations as a function of environment @xcite , increasingly at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "those studies in turn have produced the evidence for significant evolution of the s0 fraction @xcite , but have not examined whether the rate of evolution itself depends on environment .",
    "we focus on the relationship between s0 evolution and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) of the group or cluster that hosts the s0 s .",
    "processes that are expected to operate best in lower-@xmath6 environments , where the lower relative velocities between galaxies allow them to interact more effectively , include mergers and galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "those expected to work best in higher-@xmath6 environments , either directly because of the high velocities , the deeper potential implied by the high velocities , or the higher density intracluster medium , include ram pressure stripping @xcite , strangulation @xcite , and harassment @xcite .    to investigate the dependence of @xmath0  on environment , we return to published morphological samples .",
    "we use published visual morphological classifications as the indicator of galaxy type .",
    "quantities related to @xmath0 , such as @xmath10 and color distributions , have also been used to investigate such questions , but morphologies provide additional , complementary information .",
    "in fact , various recent studies are suggesting that morphological evolution is somewhat decoupled from the evolution of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "morphologies are available across a significant range of redshifts and velocity dispersions , and significant effort has been expended in putting these on a common footing across redshift ( f00 ; d07 ) .",
    "we compile an internally - consistent set of velocity dispersions , recalculating the velocity dispersion using either previously published individual galaxy redshifts or redshifts from our own observations , to provide a measure of environment . again , alternative measurements of environment exist , for example x - ray luminosities could have been used . however , x - ray measurements , particularly for low - mass , high - redshift environments , are scarce and velocity dispersions provide the most uniform and extensive data . studies using different measures of either galaxy type or environment are mixed .",
    "for example x - ray luminosities correlate with @xmath10 at @xmath11 @xcite and with early - type fraction at @xmath12 @xcite , but velocity dispersions correlate only weakly with the fraction of red galaxies within the virial radius @xcite . apparently conflicting results such as these highlight the importance of using consistent measurements of both galaxy type and environment across redshift when investigating evolution .    in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the two samples we chose to use , the spectroscopic measurements we acquired in an attempt to obtain velocity dispersions to complete the sample , and the calculation of a consistent set of velocity dispersion measurements . in  [ sec : results ] , we present our results , discuss their implications in  [ sec : discussion ] , and summarize in  [ sec : conclusion ] . when computing the aperture size used for calculating the velocity dispersion , we assume @xmath13  km  @xmath14  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( hereafter , the `` lambda cosmology '' ) .",
    "however , for the aperture size within which galaxies are included in the calculation of morphological fractions , @xmath17  km  @xmath14  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( hereafter , the `` classic cosmology '' ) is assumed .",
    "morphological fractions can depend sensitively on the aperture within which cluster members are classified and on the absolute magnitude to which the classification is done . as such",
    ", it can be quite difficult , and potentially misleading , to use classifications from disparate sources .",
    "d07 presented their own classification of a set of galaxies and combined these with a set from the literature for which they were able to closely match the classification procedure , the aperture used , and the magnitude limit .",
    "specifically , the sample presented in d07 consists of 23 galaxy clusters at @xmath200.5 drawn from the f00 sample and 10 clusters at @xmath210.8 drawn from ediscs .",
    "the f00 sample in turn consists of nine clusters at @xmath22 added by the authors themselves , five clusters at @xmath23 that either appeared in @xcite or were classified in a manner consistent with that study , and nine clusters at @xmath24 from the morphs study @xcite , all of which were classified in a consistent manner .",
    "d07 used the f00 procedure when classifying galaxies to minimize systematic differences between the two samples ; in particular , the five authors who did the morphological classification also reclassified the highest redshift clusters of f00 ( from @xmath25 ) , following the same procedure as the original authors @xcite , and found good agreement .",
    "errors on the morphological fractions for those from the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were computed using the method of @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated for the f00 morphological fractions .",
    "we calculate the uncertainties using the gehrels method , but some of the necessary information , such as the various correction and completeness factors , are not available and we infer them indirectly from the data provided by f00 . to test the sensitivity of our results to the uncertainties , we also do all the analysis described subsequently using the quoted uncertainties in f00 , which were not calculated using the gehrels method .",
    "none of the results ( including the statistical significances quoted ) change sufficiently between the two approaches to alter any of our conclusions . to directly compare their results to f00 , who present morphological fractions for non - uniform apertures that correspond to apertures of radii spanning from @xmath26 to 700 kpc , d07 used the classic cosmology to measure morphological fractions within fixed 600  kpc radius apertures for the ediscs clusters .",
    "this selection of a fixed physical aperture attempts to best match , on average , the f00 measurements , which are for a range of apertures .",
    "however , d07 demonstrated that a choice of aperture that scales with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) results in @xmath0  values that are in all cases within the uncertainty estimates .",
    "lastly , regarding the magnitude limit , d07 classify galaxies down to a fixed absolute magnitude across the redshift range , chosen to match the f00 classification procedure , assuming the rest - frame colors and @xmath29-band magnitude of an elliptical galaxy ( details provided in d07 ) .",
    "applying the incorrect cosmology ( i.e. classic rather than lambda cosmology ) results in differential magnitude limits across the redshift range from 0.2 to 0.8 of a few tenths of a magnitude , comparable to the uncertainties in the observed magnitudes themselves and therefore not expected to have a noticeable effect .",
    "a sample of @xmath30 clusters with morphological classifications and redshift measurements from @xcite also appear in d07 .",
    "however , those morphological fractions were not explicitly matched to those of f00",
    "( i.e. , by taking steps to minimize systematic differences in classification , such as those stated above ) and , therefore , we exclude these clusters to avoid any possible confusion in the interpretation of our results .",
    "including these clusters does not alter our main results .",

    "this is likely to be a significant overestimate for most systems , but we use this value to estimate the impact on the dispersions . if we simply add random velocities using a gaussian with this @xmath6 to an intrinsic gaussian of width commensurate to the line - of - sight velocity distribution of a specific group and cluster , we find that even in for our lowest velocity dispersion system ( cl1102 - 1245b ) the observational errors inflate the dispersion by less than 20 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this uncertainty is in all cases significantly less than the quoted errors on the velocity dispersion and does not affect our results .",
    "we explore the environmental dependence ( characterized by velocity dispersion ) of the apparent evolution of @xmath0  with redshift ( figure  [ fs0vz ] ) .",
    "our sample spans a range of dispersions from that typical of groups ( @xmath213  km  s@xmath5 ) to poor clusters ( @xmath214  km  s@xmath5 ) to rich clusters ( @xmath215  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "although there is no strict rule for what velocity dispersion constitutes a group versus a cluster , in what follows we use the above convention .",
    "we begin by determining whether a relationship between @xmath0  and environment ( velocity dispersion ) exists across the full redshift range . due to the selection criteria for the f00 sample ( clusters were selected based on being ",
    "well - studied \" ) , it is possible that some unappreciated selection bias manifests itself as a correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath34 .",
    "figure  6 of d07 shows a weak trend between @xmath0  and @xmath6 , although they were limited to the subset of f00 clusters with dispersion measurements and as we have noted earlier some of the most interesting clusters were missing such measurements .    in figure  [ fs0vsig ]",
    ", we present @xmath0  plotted against velocity dispersion for our sample .",
    "although the @xmath0-@xmath34 trend in figure  [ fs0vz ] appears much stronger than any trend between @xmath0and @xmath6 in figure  [ fs0vsig ] , we quantify which is the more dominant with a partial correlation analysis .",
    "the partial correlation coefficient @xmath216 , @xmath217 is useful for disentangling the interdependence between three variables ( a , b , and c ) , where one wants to account for the influence of the third variable ( c ) on the correlation of the first two .",
    "it is normalized to @xmath218 for a perfect correlation , @xmath219 for no correlation , and @xmath220 for a perfect anticorrelation between a and b after accounting for c. however , the distribution of @xmath216 does not approximate a normal distribution , so we follow the work of @xcite in using a statistic @xmath221 , where b is the dependent variable and c is the controlled variable .",
    "@xmath221 is defined as    @xmath222    with a variance @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the number of data points .",
    "the more positive ( negative ) the value of @xmath221 the stronger the correlation ( anticorrelation ) .",
    "we treat @xmath34 and @xmath6 as the independent and controlled variable , and then vice - versa .",
    "we find a stronger correlation for @xmath0  with redshift than with @xmath6 , with @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the results of the previous correlation analysis do not necessarily imply that environment ( velocity dispersion ) plays no role . from figure",
    "[ fs0vsig ] , it is apparent that there is a wide spread in @xmath0  below @xmath227  km  s@xmath5 and a much narrower spread above .",
    "we therefore split the sample into a high-@xmath6 bin and a low-@xmath6 bin at this value to investigate the effect of environment on the @xmath0-@xmath34 relation .",
    "this choice divides the sample into nearly equal parts as well as into samples that are more typical of groups / poor clusters ( @xmath228  km  s@xmath5 ) and rich clusters ( @xmath229  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "some of the clusters have suspiciously high velocity dispersions ( @xmath230 ) and are presumably unrelaxed systems ( e.g. , a1689 ) . nevertheless , given our gross binning scheme they are still likely to be systems with @xmath229  km  s@xmath5  and placed in the appropriate velocity dispersion bin .",
    "selecting a boundary anywhere up to 1050  km  s@xmath5 or down to 650  km  s@xmath5 ( after which the number of clusters in the low-@xmath6 bin drops sharply ) leaves the results that follow qualitatively unchanged , as does removing the clusters with @xmath231  km  s@xmath5 from the analysis .    in figure  [ highlow ]",
    ", we show @xmath0  plotted against redshift in the high-@xmath6 and low-@xmath6 bins .",
    "while the @xmath0-@xmath34 trend is evident in the groups / poor clusters , the correlation appears to be much weaker , if present at all , in the rich clusters . using uncertainty - weighted least - squares fitting , we find that the slope for the groups / poor clusters , @xmath232 , is steeper than the slope for the rich clusters , @xmath233 ( a @xmath234 difference in slope ) .",
    "for the high-@xmath6 clusters , one may worry that there is only one data point at @xmath235 , which has an anomalously small error of @xmath236 and therefore strongly influences the slope . to explore the impact of this one cluster on the fit , we have assigned it an uncertainty equal to the scatter in @xmath0  for the high-@xmath6 clusters , @xmath237 . with this larger",
    "uncertainty estimate the new slope is @xmath238 , resulting in only a @xmath239 difference in slope between the low- and high-@xmath6 clusters .",
    "to bolster the case for the flat relationship among the massive clusters , we compare the morphological fractions to those from @xcite .",
    "although we argued in  2.1 against using these clusters for our statistical analyses , they support our finding that the relationship with redshift is nearly flat for massive clusters ( figure  [ highlow ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the difference in behavior between the low and high-@xmath6 clusters is not the result of the one high - z ediscs cluster .",
    "lastly , the two lowest-@xmath6 clusters in the ediscs sample have @xmath0  @xmath240 and are potentially very unusual , although excluding them from this analysis does not alter the results .    the clusters driving most of the trend in the groups / poor clusters are the high-@xmath0  systems at low @xmath34 .",
    "among those at @xmath241 , there is an apparent dichotomy between those with a dense concentration of ellipticals toward the cluster center and those less centrally concentrated , in the sense that the latter have higher @xmath0(f00 ) .",
    "therefore , it is also possible that s0 evolution depends further on an environmental property marked by the distribution of cluster ellipticals .",
    "even so , there is an increase in @xmath0  since @xmath242 ( f00 ) when considering the high- and low - elliptical concentration systems separately .    in figure  [ fevz ]",
    ", we show the elliptical fraction ( @xmath243 ) plotted against redshift for the entire sample , the low-@xmath6 subsample , and the high-@xmath6 subsample . in all three cases",
    ", there is no significant trend of @xmath243  with redshift .",
    "this argues against a misclassification between s0 s and ellipticals as the origin of the s0 evolution .",
    "as we have described , previous studies have found a factor of @xmath244 increase in @xmath0  between @xmath21 and @xmath11 , with a corresponding decrease in the spiral fraction and a constant elliptical fraction @xcite . some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have noted that the trends , which at some level must be affected by selection effects and methodology , may be a result of unappreciated biases . the ability to distinguish between s0 s and ellipticals at higher redshifts , or other problems associated with morphological classification , could in principle result in spurious correlations . with this specific issue in mind",
    ", we investigate the relationships of various morphological fractions with redshift and velocity dispersion .",
    "we have already argued against a redshift - dependent classification problem in e s vs s0 s ( see above ) .",
    "what if there is an analogous problem with environment ?",
    "for example , if ellipticals are more common in the more massive environments to the limits of our classification , and if a constant fraction of those are misclassified as s0 s , then @xmath245 would appear higher in more massive environments .",
    "for figure 5 we also conclude that there is no discernible difference in the @xmath246 as a function of environment over the range of environments explored here .",
    "we now remove the ellipticals from consideration and consider a plot similar to figure  [ highlow ] in which we replace the ordinate , @xmath0 , with @xmath247 , where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are the numbers of s0 s and spirals in each cluster , respectively ( figure  [ s0svz ] ) .",
    "the dichotomy in the rate of evolution between low-@xmath6 groups / poor clusters and high-@xmath6 rich clusters remains , with slopes of @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively ( a 3.8@xmath6 difference in slope ) .",
    "the difference between the morphological fractions of the two environments at low redshifts indicates that the morphological distinction between spirals and s0 s is reflecting a true underlying difference between the two environments .",
    "the difference in evolutionary trends does not , unfortunately , necessarily imply that the trends are unaffected by misclassification ; if the two environments have different intrinsic fractions of spirals and s0 s , then redshift - dependent misclassification could affect each environment differently .    given the results described so far , we interpret ( as others before have , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the evolving s0 fraction represents the transformation of spirals into s0 s .",
    "the difference here is that the s0 evolution ( over these redshifts ) is taking place primarily in groups / poor clusters with @xmath228  km  s@xmath5  ( figure  [ highlow ] ) , suggesting that this is the location of s0 formation .",
    "this result then supports the hypothesis that direct galaxy interactions , i.e. mergers and/or close tidal encounters , are the dominant mechanisms in converting spirals into s0 s over the redshift interval examined .",
    "the value of @xmath6 where galaxy - galaxy processes dominate and where galaxy - environment process dominate is not theoretically well constrained .",
    "although we choose a cutoff at @xmath252  km  s@xmath5 to divide the sample into equal parts , and expect mergers and/or tidal interactions to dominate in the low-@xmath6 subsample , the division into two subsamples only crudely reflects a distinction of environments where different physical effects may dominate .",
    "however , the existence of high @xmath0  systems with low velocity dispersions demonstrates that _ neither _ the nature or nurture of massive environments is necessary to the formation of s0 s .",
    "the conclusion that groups are the site of s0 formation , and therefore that mergers / interactions are the formation mechanism , has been arrived at in various ways .",
    "@xcite find a high @xmath0  already in place in @xmath1 groups .",
    "@xcite find more - pronounced s0 evolution in clusters with @xmath253  km  s@xmath5 by comparing a @xmath254 sample to a high - z sample , although their inclusion of the same ediscs clusters means the results are not entirely independent from ours .",
    "more distinctly , @xcite find that s0 s differ from normal spirals due to a higher bulge luminosity rather than fainter disks , and interpret this as requiring bulge growth during s0 formation .",
    "they conclude that such formation mechanisms as strangulation and ram pressure stripping are therefore disfavored .",
    "@xcite argue that the large scatter they measure in the local s0 tully - fisher relation support formation mechanisms that kinematically disturb the galaxies , i.e. interactions .",
    "the unique aspect of our observations is that we establish both the redshift and the environment at which this formation is occurring . thereby , we identify the exact place to focus further investigation and perhaps distinguish the progenitors .",
    "fortunately , this evolution happens at redshifts that are relatively easily accessed with current technology .",
    "although s0 evolution is seen primarily in the low-@xmath6 clusters and the values of @xmath0  reach between 0.5 and 0.6 at @xmath255 , the rate of s0 formation must reverse itself at some low value of the velocity dispersion so as not to overpopulate the field with s0 s ( the local field @xmath0  @xmath256 ; * ? ? ?",
    "determining this transitional value of the velocity dispersion would further aid our understanding of the environmental processes at work .",
    "for example , one might find that this velocity dispersion corresponds to that of environments where the probability of interactions in a hubble time become unlikely ( e.g. slightly more massive than the local group ) .",
    "our lowest-@xmath34 clusters extend down to @xmath26 km  s@xmath5 , while the @xmath11 clusters of @xcite probe down to @xmath257 km  s@xmath5 , setting an upper limit on where the trend must reverse ( our two lowest velocity dispersion systems , both with @xmath258 km s@xmath5 , but high redshifts , have @xmath0  @xmath259 , perhaps suggesting where this turnover occurs ) .",
    "so far , we have not accounted for the effects of the hierarchical growth of groups and clusters on the question of s0 evolution .",
    "groups and clusters grow over time , accreting galaxies from the field and/or groups , so that systems at @xmath260 with a particular value of @xmath6 do not correspond to those of the same @xmath6 at @xmath261 .",
    "it has generally been assumed , due to the expectation that s0 s would be rarer in low density environments , that any accretion these systems experience would be s0-poor , hence the need to transform some fraction of these galaxies into s0 s . from figure  [ highlow ] , we now know that this is not the case , at least for @xmath262 .",
    "in fact , at low @xmath34 it appears that high-@xmath34 clusters could increase their @xmath0  over time by accreting these smaller systems without requiring any morphological transformation mechanism .",
    "how much of the observed @xmath0-@xmath34 trend in the high-@xmath6 rich clusters could simply be due to the accretion of smaller , s0-rich groups / poor clusters similar to those in our low-@xmath6 subsample ?    to estimate the increase in the number of cluster galaxies with redshift , we note that the mass of rich clusters at @xmath21 typically increases @xmath263 by @xmath261 @xcite , and assume that this increase in mass corresponds to the same relative increase in the number of cluster galaxies .",
    "we also assume that the mass accretion comes in the form of our low-@xmath6 groups . to the degree that field galaxies , with their lower @xmath245 , account for the accreted mass",
    "then this model will be an overestimate of the effect .",
    "the final s0 fraction @xmath264 in this simple model is @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the s0 fraction of the cluster at @xmath267 , @xmath268 is the fractional increase in number of cluster galaxies from @xmath267 to @xmath261 , i.e. @xmath269 based on the @xcite models , and @xmath270 is the s0 fraction for low-@xmath34 groups , for which we adopt a conservative value of 0.4 . from our best - fit trend in the high-@xmath6 panel of figure  [ highlow ] ,",
    "the s0 fraction for a massive cluster at @xmath271 , @xmath266 , is 0.25 .",
    "using equation  ( 4 ) gives @xmath272 , consistent with our best - fit trend at @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , this simple model suggests that the trend of increasing @xmath0  with @xmath34 in the high-@xmath6 clusters _ could _ be accounted for solely by the accretion of s0-rich groups .",
    "regardless of the actual accretion history , we conclude that the accretion of at least some s0-rich groups will explain part of the increase in @xmath0 in clusters .",
    "the results presented here ( and elsewhere ) that s0 galaxies are forming at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath273 ) and in low-@xmath6 groups , implies that we should be able to identify and study both the progenitor class and the galaxies undergoing this transition .",
    "post - starburst galaxies are commonly suspected to be late - time examples of the latter @xcite .",
    "if so , this transformation affects both the morphology and stellar population of the galaxy and we expect based on our results that 1 ) s0 s in rich clusters at @xmath261 will have mostly old stellar populations ( @xmath274  gyr ) because most of their s0 population has been in place since @xmath260 and 2 ) the s0 s in low-@xmath6 , @xmath261 clusters will have a mix of young and old stars , with roughly 50% of the s0 s having a significant fraction of their stars that are younger than @xmath244  gyr old",
    "( evidence for some relatively young s0 galaxies in the field now exists ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by compiling a large set of clusters with both internally - consistent morphological classifications and uniform velocity dispersions , @xmath6 , we examined the rate of change in the s0 fraction , @xmath0 , with redshift as a function of environment .",
    "we show that for our entire sample @xmath0  is primarily correlated with redshift and not significantly correlated with velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath0  with redshift is much stronger among @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 galaxy groups / poor clusters than in higher-@xmath6 rich clusters .",
    "we interpret this result to mean that direct processes like galaxy mergers , which are expected to dominate in lower-@xmath6 environments , are the primary mechanisms for morphological transformation over the redshift range explored , @xmath275 .",
    "further studies would benefit from a larger sample size , in particular having @xmath0  and @xmath6 measurements for both groups / poor clusters and rich clusters with comparable numbers across a similar range in redshift .",
    "this study highlights the importance of having velocity dispersion measurements in evolutionary studies , so that one can account for any environmental dependence of the evolution itself . in particular",
    ", we emphasize that more complete samples of environments are needed and that large numbers of redshifts per system are necessary to convincingly measure velocity dispersions of low - mass systems .",
    "lastly , as emphasized by @xcite and @xcite , local density may be a critical factor in s0 formation .",
    "we can not measure the evolution of @xmath0  as a function of local density from our data due to the small number of spectroscopic members per system , but both larger cluster / group samples and more redshifts per system would enable such a study .",
