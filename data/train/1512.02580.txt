    "driven diffusive systems have been of interest to a wide community of researchers since the first models were introduced @xcite .",
    "mostly motivated by their ability to demonstrate the curious phenomena of non - equilibrium systems despite their theoretical simplicity , various different systems of such are proposed @xcite .",
    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) being one of the simplest of those , with particles interacting exclusively , hopping to both directions or in and out of the system with certain probability rates on a one dimensional lattice , can demonstrate the interesting theoretical phenomena such as phase separation @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , phase coexistence @xcite , and shock formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can be utilised in modelling various real life problems such as transport of inter - cellular motor proteins @xcite , traffic jams @xcite , surface growth @xcite .",
    "one dimensional asymmetrical simple exclusion process ( asep ) systems with open boundaries are bounded to particle baths of constant densities at both ends , which can be modelled with constant boundary crossing rates for particles which enter or leave the system .",
    "although considerable amount of work exists on the time - independent steady state properties , there are only a few examples which study the effect of applying time - dependent or oscillatory boundary rates to these systems .",
    "for instance popkov _",
    "_ apply an on and off boundary condition to the single - species , semi - infinite asep , such that the oscillating exit probability rates can be thought as red and green traffic lights @xcite .",
    "a significance of their result which is relevant to our work is the observation that the density fluctuations propagate with a typical velocity into the lattice from the boundary .",
    "the fluctuation although weakening as it propagates , preserves its characteristic shape within the bulk .",
    "they observe the density response of the system has a sawtooth - like characteristics with periodic pileups related to the red - green light periods of the system independent of the initial conditions .",
    "they also showed same behaviour exists in the hydrodynamic limit . in another work , basu _ et al .",
    "_ , applied a sinusoidal drive to the boundaries of single - species simple exclusion process ( sep ) and asep models , in which particles are allowed to move to the in both directions in symmetric and asymmetric rates correspondingly .",
    "they performed fourier analysis of the response of both systems .",
    "they found that the structure functions have bimodality , which they claim , indicate the modes of transportation in diffusive systems @xcite .    in this present work ,",
    "we carry out a monte carlo study of a two - species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) such that the boundary conditions ( bc ) are abruptly oscillating with relatively small amplitudes around a phase transition point .",
    "we show that the system responds in qualitatively different forms , depending on the frequency of the perturbation .",
    "in particular , there appears to be a dynamical transition where the response of the system changes from that of a symmetric state to that of an near - symmetric one abruptly , as a function of the frequency of the perturbation .",
    "this transition is independent of the size of the perturbation .",
    "the phases in the phase diagram of the time - independent model were first reported by evans _",
    "they identified through a mean field analysis , four different phases of the order parameter density , for all symmetric parameters of the two - species .",
    "one of the phases surprisingly display broken symmetry . between the symmetric and asymmetric phases",
    "they report a tiny regime in which particle densities are low but not symmetric .",
    "( we will label three of the phases of interest to us as @xmath0 [ symmetric low density - low density ] , @xmath1[the broken symmetry high density - low density ] , and @xmath2 [ tiny regime ] . )",
    "we will give a precise definition of the model in the next section .",
    "for our general discussion at this point , we demonstrate how the joint density function @xmath3 behaves near @xmath2 as a function of the boundary exit rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the two types of particles .",
    "( arndt _ et al . _",
    "discuss the structure of these phases in detail in @xcite . )     for number of particles for various paramaters under constant bc . for a lattice size of @xmath6 , parameters for the plot @xmath7 are @xmath8 , for the plot @xmath9 are @xmath10 and for the plot @xmath11 are @xmath12 and for the plot @xmath13 they are asymmetric as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig : combined],width=325 ]    @xmath2 was shown to be a finite size effect by erickson _",
    "_ @xcite . through a monte carlo analysis they showed that the size of this phase decays exponentially with respect to lattice size .",
    "detailed analysis of the joint density distributions of two types of particles for this regime reveals that the density is a superposition of  shock profiles \" along the length of the system @xcite .",
    "each profile , which corresponds to a particular number of type i particles in the system , has an error - function like shape , whose midpoint is carrying out a random walk across the lattice @xcite .",
    "the random walk is constrained when the shock approaches a boundary , if it gets too near the particle entry ( exit ) boundary , the increase ( decrease ) in the density near the boundary has a compensating effect on the position of the shock , pushing it away from the boundary .",
    "the entry and exit rates as a function of the position of the shock may then be interpreted as a  force \" on the shocks , with a corresponding  potential \" , in which the random walk is carried out@xcite .",
    "[ fig : equi_shocks ] shows these profiles corresponding to several values of occupation of the lattice at time - independent steady state .",

    "the boundary rates are kept fixed at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it can be observed that the profiles for @xmath21 and @xmath22 deviate in character from others due to boundary effect .",
    "[ fig : equi_shocks],width=325 ]    the discussion above points out two different features for the motion of the shock profile : the first corresponds to diffusive , damped motion in an effective potential .",
    "the second is the mechanism of application of an effective force through the manipulation of the boundary conditions , which will have a retarded effect dependent on the position in the lattice .",
    "we have looked into possibility of the production of interesting effects through the interplay of these two features .",
    "we investigate whether it is possible to force the shocks in the system by simply oscillating the boundary conditions .",
    "we observe significant frequency dependence which is unusual for a diffusive system .",
    "we have also observed hysteresis in the density function of the system .",
    "such behaviour was observed earlier in similar systems by rakos _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "hysteresis in our model appears abruptly as perturbation frequency is decreased , associated with a typical velocity in the system . in the following sections we first introduce the model we are studying , and how we apply the oscillatory boundary conditions .",
    "we then move on to the discussion of the response of the system to the boundary conditions .",
    "the system which is studied in this paper is tasep on a finite , one - dimensional lattice with open boundaries and two species .",
    "particles of type 1 ( 2 ) are allowed to enter the system from the left ( right ) with probability rate @xmath23 , move only forward with probability rate @xmath24 if the following site is empty , and leave the system from the opposite end with probability rate @xmath25 .",
    "different types of particles are allowed to switch places with rate @xmath26 when they come face to face . in our simulations",
    "all probability rates except the exit rates were taken to be equal to @xmath16 .",

    "we maintain a list of all possible events @xmath33 ( possible particle jumps within the system and motion through the boundaries ) and rates @xmath34 associated with them . the total rate for any one of these events happening is then given by @xmath35 .",
    "a random variable @xmath36 which corresponds to the time increment for the next event is then given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 a random number uniformly distributed between @xmath39 and @xmath16 .",
