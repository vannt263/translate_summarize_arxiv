    "<S> we study the chiral behavior of the nucleon and @xmath0-isobar masses within a manifestly covariant chiral effective - field theory , consistent with the analyticity principle . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the @xmath1 and @xmath2 one - loop contributions to the mass and field - normalization constant , and find that they can be described in terms of universal relativistic loop functions , multiplied by appropriate spin , isospin and coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these relativistic one - loop corrections , when properly renormalized , obey the chiral power - counting and vanish in the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> the results including only the @xmath1-loop corrections compare favorably with the lattice qcd data for the pion - mass dependence of the nucleon and @xmath0 masses , while inclusion of the @xmath3 loops tends to spoil this agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10000    the nucleon mass ( @xmath4 940 mev ) is much larger than the sum of the masses of its constituents ( @xmath5 mev ) , hence almost all of it is generated by the strong interaction among the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> an exact description of this phenomenon has not yet been derived from qcd , however , tremendous progress has been achieved in the numerical computation of the nucleon mass in lattice qcd  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main limitations of the lattice qcd studies is that the finite lattice size restricts the value of quark masses from below , and thus the quarks in present lattice studies are much heavier than in reality . it became a common practice to perform lattice calculations for different values of quark masses and then _ extrapolate _ the results to the physical point .    </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation in the quark mass is not straightforward , because the non - analytic dependencies , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are shown to be important as one approaches the small physical value of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore naive extrapolations often fail , while spectacular non - analytic effects are found in a number of different quantities , see _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is known how to compute these non - analytic terms in _ chiral effective field theory _ ( cheft )  a low - energy effective field theory of qcd . for recent examples of such calculations for the nucleon and other baryon masses </S>",
    "<S> see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a new calculation of the quark - mass dependence of the nucleon and @xmath0-isobar masses in the framework of relativistic cheft , with the emphasis on the _ analyticity _ constraint .    in the cheft </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is mediated by pions , which are the goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit - chiral - symmetry breaking terms , represented by the pion and quark masses in cheft and qcd , respectively , are related via the gell - mann  oaks  renner relation : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 mev@xmath11 represents the value of the quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> lattice calculations confirm this relation for a very broad range of quark masses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quark - mass dependence of quantities in qcd can be translated to the pion - mass dependence of these quantities in cheft and vice versa .    as the strength of the goldstone boson interactions is proportional to their energy , at sufficiently low energies a convergent perturbative expansion in cheft is possible . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the lattice results are presently obtained for pion masses above 300 mev where the chiral expansion is not expected to converge well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one resorts to methods where the leading non - analytic cheft results are combined with more phenomenological techniques such that the resulting approach has a wider range of applicability @xcite , albeit lesser predictive power .    </S>",
    "<S> recently it has often been argued  @xcite that the manifestly relativistic cheft calculations have , in some cases , better convergence than their heavy - baryon ( semi - relativistic ) counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the convergence of the cheft expansion is improved by a resummation of nominally higher - order terms which are relativistic corrections to the leading non - analytic terms . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus improve on the convergence of the chiral expansion without loss of predictive power , or in plain words , without introducing additional free parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the original formulation of chiral perturbation theory with nucleons had been relativistic  @xcite , but was claimed to violate the chiral power counting . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called _ heavy - baryon _ chiral perturbation theory , which treats nucleons semi - relativistically , was developed to cure the power - counting problem  @xcite , and a lot of work has been done since in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , becher and leutwyler  @xcite proposed a manifestly lorentz - invariant formulation supplemented with so - called _ infrared regularization _ ( ir ) of loops </S>",
    "<S> in which the chiral power - counting is manifest . at about the same time </S>",
    "<S> it was realized  @xcite that power - counting can be maintained in a relativistic formalism without the ir or the heavy - baryon expansions . </S>",
    "<S> the original , straightforward formulation  @xcite complies with chiral power - counting if appropriate renormalizations of available low - energy constants are done .    </S>",
    "<S> power - counting issues apart , the original relativistic formulation has a particular advantage over the ir scheme in that it preserves _ analyticity _ of the loop contributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ir procedure spoils the analyticity by introducing unphysical cuts in the complex energy plane . in our work </S>",
    "<S> we therefore prefer to use a manifestly lorentz - covariant formulation of cheft , supplemented with appropriate renormalizations  @xcite , rather than infrared regularizations  @xcite , to maintain power counting .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with defining the effective chiral lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> writing here only the first - order terms involving the isovector pseudoscalar pion field @xmath12 , the spin-1/2 isospin-1/2 nucleon field @xmath13 and spin-3/2 isospin-3/2 field @xmath14 of the @xmath0-isobar we have ( in the conventions of appendix a ) : ^(1 ) & = & n ( i -m_n ) n + n ^_5^a ( _ n ) _ ^a + & + & _ </S>",

    "<S> ( ^i _ - m_^(0 ) ^ ) _ , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the chiral - limit value of the masses and the field - renormalization constants , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> our choice of the chiral lagrangian is different from the ones previously used in the literature ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) in two important aspects :    * the @xmath37 coupling differs from the usual _ pseudovector _ coupling : @xmath38 which is standardly used at this order . the difference between this and our @xmath39 coupling is of higher order as can easily be shown by using partial integration and the dirac equation for the nucleon field . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , our choice simplifies the calculation and , most importantly , allows us to write down the results for the nucleon and the @xmath0 in the same form , see below . </S>",
    "<S> * the couplings of the spin-3/2 field are invariant under a gauge transformation : _ _ + _ , with @xmath40 a spinor field . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement is called for by the consistency with the free spin-3/2 field theory  @xcite , which is formulated such that the number of spin degrees of freedom is constrained to the physical number , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details .    </S>",
    "<S> both of these points are crucial for the consistency and elegance of this calculation .    point ( ii ) , in particular , allows us to use simpler forms for the spin-3/2 propagator . indeed , as can be read off , the propagator of the massive spin-3/2 field is the inverse of the free - field operator : ( s^-1 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> ( p ) = _ p^- m _ , where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the gauge symmetry under and hence the spin-3/2 constraints : @xmath43 , one can obtain other , equivalent , forms of the propagator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can , for example , derive the following gauge - fixing term : _ = -i ( | -| ) , with the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath44 , a real number . upon adding this term </S>",
    "<S> , the free - field operator becomes : ( s^-1 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> ( p ) & = & ( -m ) _ + ( 1 + ) ( _ p_- _ p _ ) + & = & _ ( -m ) - ( 1- ) ( _ p_- _ p _ ) , and it is not difficult to find its inverse : s^ ( p ) = . </S>",
    "<S> some simple gauges are : = 1 : & & s^ ( p)= ( g^ - ^^ ) , + = -1 : & & s^ ( p)= ( g^ - ^^ ) , + = : & & s^ ( p)= ^(3/2)(p ) , where ^(3/2)(p ) = ( g^ - ) + ^ p _ is the covariant spin-3/2 projection operator . obviously , @xmath45 corresponds with the usual rarita - schwinger propagator . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe that for @xmath46 the propagator has a smooth massless limit . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that our results are independent of the gauge - fixing parameter , because all the spin-3/2 couplings used here are symmetric with respect to the gauge transformation .    in this spin-3/2 formalism </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 self - energy takes a simple form : _ ( p ) = ( ) p^(3/2)_(p ) , where @xmath47 has the spin-1/2 lorentz structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both nucleon and @xmath0-isobar self - energies can be expressed in the same lorentz form , without complications of the lower - spin sector of the spin-3/2 theory considered in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .the coefficient @xmath48 entering the @xmath1- and @xmath3-loop contributions in the baryon mass formula . </S>",
    "<S> the rational numbers in the brackets represent the spin (= isospin ) factors . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by studying the expansion of these functions near the chiral limit , see appendix b , we find that the chiral expansion for the mass goes as : m_b = m_b^(0 ) - 4 c_1b m_^2 + _ bb m_^3 + _ </S>",
    "<S> bb m_+ o(m_^4 ) , where @xmath49 and the chiral coefficients can be read off . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion shows explicitly that the ( renormalized ) relativistic loop contributions vanish in the chiral limit , as they must . also , since there are no contributions which , near the chiral limit , scale with positive powers of @xmath0 , the introduction of counter - terms of such nature , as is done in @xcite , is unnecessary , and would be excessive in this calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the expansion also shows that the loop contributions obey the chiral power counting . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the so - called @xmath50-counting  @xcite , the @xmath1 and @xmath3 loop contributions to the nucleon mass count as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , which for small @xmath53 agrees with . in the @xmath50-counting </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop result thus represents a complete calculation to order @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a full fourth ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 order calculation of both @xmath1 and @xmath57 loops requires calculation of diagrams in with a @xmath58 vertex from @xmath59 ( two derivatives of the pion field ) and the tadpole contributions . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation is a worthwhile topic for a future work .    the @xmath1 contribution to the @xmath0 self - energy has an imaginary part for @xmath60 , which gives rise to the @xmath0 width . </S>",
    "<S> according to this calculation the width is given by  @xcite : @xmath61^{5/2 } ( \\de^2-m_\\pi^2)^{3/2}.\\ ] ] the experimental value , @xmath62 mev , fixes @xmath63 , the value which we shall use in numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> note also that this value is in a much better agreement with the large-@xmath22 value @xmath64 , than with the su(6)-relation value , @xmath65 . for the @xmath0 axial coupling @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> we use the su(6 ) relation , which in this case coincides with the large-@xmath22 relation : @xmath66 .    </S>",

    "<S> the two low - energy constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are related to reproduce the physical nucleon mass at the physical pion mass value . </S>",
    "<S> the only free parameter can then be adjusted to reproduce the lattice data , shown by the squares . </S>",
    "<S> note that these lattice data are not corrected for finite volume effects , which are known to increase with decreasing @xmath69 , and have been estimated to reach 0.03 gev for @xmath70 gev@xmath71  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve in shows the @xmath1-loop contribution to the nucleon mass , with @xmath72  gev and @xmath73  gev@xmath74 . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed curve shows the corresponding leading non - analytic result [ @xmath76 term in ] for the same parameters . </S>",

    "<S> n = 85 - 17 - 11 = 57 , where the numbers refer to the contributions of @xmath68 , the @xmath1 , and the @xmath3 loops , respectively .    in absence of a complete fourth order calculation for both @xmath1 and @xmath57 loop contributions , we estimate the higher order terms here in a simple way by allowing for one additional term , proportional to @xmath84 in the baryon mass formula as  : m_b = m_b^(0 ) - 4 c_1b m_^2 + c_2b m_^4 + , where the chiral loop contribution is calculated as discussed above in . </S>",

    "<S> for the @xmath39 coupling we adopt a form which is similar to the above - mentioned @xmath0 couplings . the resulting relativistic loop corrections obey the chiral power - counting , after renormalizations of the available counter - terms are done . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic expressions also contain the nominally higher - order terms , which are necessary to satisfy the analyticity constraint . </S>",
    "<S> as has been shown here on the example of the nucleon and @xmath91 masses , the convergence of the chiral expansion can be improved in this way , without introducing additional free parameters . in particular , we find that the relativistic calculation , including only the @xmath1 loops , is able to describe the lattice results for both nucleon and @xmath91 masses up to @xmath75  gev@xmath71 with only one free parameter . including the @xmath57 loops , however , spoils the agreement with the lattice result . </S>",
    "<S> we then estimated the effect of the higher - order terms by adding a @xmath84 term to the baryon mass . </S>",
    "<S> using the additional free parameter , one is able to obtain a description of the lattice calculation with the relativistic @xmath85 result up to @xmath75  gev@xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> while a full fourth order calculation of both @xmath1 and @xmath57 loops is a worthwhile topic for future work , the present relativistic chiral - loop calculation can be used in the interpolation between full lattice qcd simulations and the experimental results . </S>"
