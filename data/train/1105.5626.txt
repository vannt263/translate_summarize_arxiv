    "we consider the frustrated ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin-@xmath0 chain and show that upon changing system parameters such as the coupling constants or @xmath2 , one can tune the effective interaction between magnons from repulsive to attractive by exploiting the existence of resonances . as a main result ,",
    "we demonstrate that , close to resonances , where the scattering length is much larger than the lattice constant , and in the case of attractive effective interactions , the intrinsic hard - coreness of spins does not play a significant role in the limit of a dilute gas of magnons . a behavior resembling the collapse of attractively interacting bosons @xcite therefore exists in such spin systems close to their fully polarized state .",
    "the thermodynamic instability of collapsed states causes jumps in the magnetization curve just below saturation .",

    "our work demonstrates that the mapping of a _",

    "in the language of spins , the inverse magnetic susceptibility at saturation becomes negative , and hence , following standard arguments,@xcite we conclude that there is a first - order transition at @xmath23 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a jump in the magnetization curve just below saturation .    as pointed out above , the case of @xmath1",
    "is special since the scattering length is typically of the order of the lattice constant here .",
    "the mapping of the @xmath1 case to a two - component bose gas ( by the procedure presented above for @xmath19 ) can be trusted only for @xmath115 , where the scattering length becomes much larger than the lattice constant . in that case",
    "we can easily incorporate the exact hard - core constraint into our formalism @xcite and again expect that @xmath1 also shows metamagnetic behavior .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with dmrg results for @xmath1.@xcite note that a metamagnetic jump can also be stabilized for spin @xmath13 with suitable anisotropic exchange interactions.@xcite however , with our procedure we can not account for the formation of stable two- , three- , and four - magnon bound states that is characteristic for most of the region @xmath116 in the spin-@xmath13 frustrated ferromagnetic heisenberg chain.@xcite    going back to @xmath19 , at lower @xmath117 , corresponding to higher densities of magnons , the hard - core nature of spins eventually prevails as well , resulting in a uniform ground state at a nonzero momentum .",
    "however , as already mentioned , from the finite - size analysis of the two - magnon problem , we observe that bound states disappear with decreasing @xmath7 , suggesting that the attractive effective potential ( in the limit of a small magnon density ) can become repulsive upon increasing the magnon densities .",
