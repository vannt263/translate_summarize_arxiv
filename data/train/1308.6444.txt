    "a graph is _ berge _ if none of its induced subgraphs , and none of the induced subgraphs of its complement , is an odd chordless cycle on at least five vertices .",
    "berge  @xcite conjectured in the 1960s that a graph is berge if and only if it is perfect .",
    "this was proved in 2002 by chudnovsky , robertson , seymour and thomas  @xcite .",
    "their proof relies on a _ decomposition theorem _ : every berge graph is either in some simple basic class , or has some kind of decomposition . in 2002 ,",
    "chudnovsky , cornujols , liu , seymour and vukovi  @xcite described a polynomial time algorithm that decides whether any input graph is berge .",
    "the method used in @xcite to color perfect graphs ( or equivalently by  @xcite , berge graphs ) is based on the ellipsoid method , and so far no purely combinatorial method is known . in particular ,",
    "it is not known whether the decomposition theorem from  @xcite may be used to color berge graphs in polynomial time .",
    "this question contains several potentially easier questions .",
    "since the decomposition theorem has several outcomes , one may wonder separately for each of them whether it is helpful for coloring .",
    "the basic graphs are all easily colorable , so the problem is with the decompositions .",
    "one of them , namely the balanced skew - partition , seems to be hopeless .",
    "the other ones ( namely the @xmath5-join , the complement @xmath5-join and the homogeneous pair ) seem to be more useful for coloring and we now explain the first step in this direction .",
    "chudnovsky  @xcite proved a decomposition theorem for berge graphs that is more precise than the theorem from  @xcite .",
    "based on this theorem , trotignon  @xcite proved an even more precise decomposition theorem , that was used by trotignon and vukovi  @xcite to devise a polynomial algorithm that colors berge graphs with no balanced skew - partition , homogeneous pair nor complement @xmath5-join .",
    "this algorithm focuses on the @xmath5-join decompositions . here",
    ", we strengthen this result by constructing a polynomial time algorithm that colors berge graphs with no balanced skew - partition .",
    "our algorithm is based directly on @xcite , and a few results from  @xcite and @xcite are used .",
    "it should be pointed out that the method presented here is significantly simpler and shorter than @xcite , while proving a more general result .",
    "this improvement is mainly due to the use of _ trigraphs _ , that are graphs where some edges are left `` undecided '' .",
    "this notion introduced by chudnovsky  @xcite helps a lot to handle inductions , especially when several kinds of decompositions appear in an arbitrary order .",
    "it is well known that an @xmath6 algorithm that computes a maximum weighted stable set for a class of perfect graphs closed under complementation , yields an @xmath7 algorithm that computes an optimal coloring .",
    "see for instance  @xcite , @xcite or section  [ sec : color ] below .",
    "this method , due to grstchel , lovsz , and schrijver , is quite effective and combinatorial .",
    "hence , from here on we just focus on an algorithm that computes a maximum weighted stable set . also , in what follows , in order to keep the paper as readable as possible , we construct an algorithm that computes the weight of a maximum weighted stable set , but does not output a set .",
    "however , all our methods are clearly constructive , so our algorithm may easily be turned into an algorithm that actually computes the desired stable set .",
    "our algorithm may easily be turned into a _ robust _",
    "algorithm , that is an algorithm that takes any graph as an input , and outputs either a stable set on @xmath8 vertices and a partition of @xmath9 into @xmath8 cliques of @xmath2 ( so , a coloring of the complement ) , or some polynomial size certificate proving that @xmath2 is not `` berge - with - no - balanced - skew - partition '' . in the first case , we know by the duality principle that the stable set is a maximum one , and the clique cover is an optimal one , even if the input graph is not in the class `` berge - with - no - balanced - skew - partition '' .",
    "this feature is interesting , because our algorithm is faster than the fastest one ( so far ) for recognizing berge graphs ( berge graphs can be recognized in @xmath10 time  @xcite , and determining whether a berge graph has a balanced skew partition can be done in @xmath11 time  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the certificate is not just and odd hole or antihole , or a balanced skew - partition .",
    "if the algorithm fails to find a stable set at some point , the certificate is a decomposition tree , one leaf of which satisfies none of the outputs of the decomposition theorem for berge graphs with no balanced skew - partitions ; and if the algorithm fails to find a clique cover , the certificate is a matrix on @xmath12 rows showing that the graph is not perfect ( see section  [ sec : color ] ) .",
    "this really certifies that a graph is not in our class , but is maybe not as desirable as a hole , antihole , or balanced skew - partition .    in section  [ sec : def ]",
    ", we give all the definitions and state some known results . in section  [ sec : blocks ] , we define a new class of berge trigraphs called @xmath13 , and we prove a decomposition theorems for trigraphs from @xmath13 . in section  [ sec : blockdec ] , we define _ blocks _ of decomposition . in section",

    "results in the next sections are not needed to prove our main result .",
    "we include them because they are of indepedent interest ( while on the same subject ) . in section",
    "[ sec : color ] , we describe the classical algorithm that colors a perfect graph with a stable set oracle . we include it because it is hard to extract it from the deeper material that surrounds it in @xcite or  @xcite . in section  [ sec : ext ] , we show that berge trigraphs with no balanced skew partitions admit extreme decompositions , that are decompositions one block of decomposition of which is a basic trigraph .",
    "we do not need them here , but extreme decompositions are sometimes very useful , in particular to prove properties by induction . in section  [ sec : end ] we give an algorithm for finding extreme decompositions in a trigraph ( if any ) . in section  [ sec : enlarge ] , we state several open questions about how this work could be generalized to larger classes of graphs .",

    "each of them outputs a fragment of minimum cardinality among all fragments of its respective kind . hence",

    "let us first deal with @xmath5-joins .",
    "a set @xmath998 of proper @xmath906-tuples is _ universal _ if for every proper @xmath5-join with split @xmath999 , there exists @xmath1000 such that @xmath1001 , @xmath1002 , @xmath1003 , @xmath1004 . instead of testing all @xmath906-tuples as in the @xmath992 time algorithm above , it is obviously enough to restrict the search to a universal set of @xmath906-tuples .",

    "it is easy to obtain a similar algorithm for trigraphs .",
    "the next idea for @xmath5-joins is to apply the method from table  [ algom ] to @xmath1005 for all @xmath27 s instead of @xmath1006 for all @xmath995 s . as we explain now ,",
    "this finds a @xmath5-join compatible with @xmath1007 when there is one . for suppose @xmath129",
    "is such a @xmath5-join .",
    "if @xmath135 contains a vertex @xmath28 whose neighborhood ( in @xmath21 ) is different from @xmath1008 , then by  [ 2joinform ] , @xmath28 has at least one neighbor in @xmath1009 . hence , when the loop considers @xmath1010 , the method from table  [ algom ] moves some new vertices in @xmath103 .",
    "so , at the end , @xmath1011 and the @xmath5-join is detected .",
    "so , the method fails to detect a @xmath5-join only when @xmath28 has degree  2 and @xmath1012 is a path while a @xmath5-join compatible with @xmath444 exists , with @xmath28 in the same side as @xmath1013 . in fact , since all vertices @xmath27 are tried , this is a problem only if this failure occurs for every possible @xmath27 , that is if the @xmath5-join we look for has one side made of @xmath908 , @xmath348 , and a bunch of vertices @xmath1014 of degree  2 all adjacent to @xmath908 and @xmath348 .",
    "but in this case , either one of the @xmath1015 s is strongly complete to @xmath1016 and it is the center of star cutset , or all the @xmath1015 s are adjacent to at least one of @xmath1017 by a switchable pair . in this last case ,",
    "all the @xmath1015 s are moved to @xmath103 when we run the method from table  [ algom ] , so the @xmath5-join is in fact detected .",
    "complement @xmath5-joins are handled by the same method in the complement .",
    "let us now consider homogeneous pairs .",
    "it is convenient to define _ weak homogeneous pairs _ exactly as proper homogeneous pairs , except that we require that `` @xmath1018 , @xmath1019 and @xmath1020 '' instead of `` @xmath791 and @xmath792 '' .",
    "a theorem similar to  [ l : forcing ] exists , where the input of the algorithm is a graph @xmath2 , a triple @xmath1021 and a set @xmath1022 that contains @xmath1013 but not @xmath909 , and the output is a weak homogeneous pair @xmath163 such that @xmath1023 , @xmath1024 , @xmath1025 and @xmath1026 , and such that @xmath909 is complete to @xmath50 and anticomplete to @xmath52 , if any such weak homogeneous pair exits .",
    "as in  [ l : forcing ] , the running time is @xmath423 and the weak homogeneous pair is minimal among all possible weak homogeneous pairs .",

    "as proved in  @xcite , there exists an algorithm that generates in time @xmath423 a universal set of size at most @xmath423 of triples for any input graph .",
    "it is very easy to obtain a similar algorithm for trigraphs . as in the @xmath5-join case",
    ", we apply the analogue of  [ l : forcing ] to all vertices @xmath27 instead of all pairs @xmath995 .",
    "the only problem is when after the call to the analogue of  [ l : forcing ] , we have a weak and non - proper homogeneous pair ( so @xmath1028 ) .",
    "but then , it can be checked that the trigraph has a star cutset or a star cutset in the complement .",
    "the class @xmath1029 of berge graphs for which we are able to compute maximum stable sets , namely berge graphs with no balanced skew - partitions , has a strange disease : it is not closed under taking induced subgraphs . but from an algorithmic point of view , since we are able to do the computations with weights on the vertices , we can simulate `` taking an induced subgraph '' by putting weight zero on the vertices that we want to delete .",
    "this suggests that in fact , we work on the more general class @xmath1030 of graphs that are induced subgraphs of some graph in @xmath1029 . the class @xmath1031 is closed under taking induced subgraphs so it must be defined by a list of forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "we leave the following questions open : what are the forbidden induced subgraphs for @xmath1031 ?",
    "one could think that @xmath1031 is in fact the class of all berge graphs , but it is not the case as shown by the graph @xmath2 represented in figure  [ fig : contrex4 ] . the graph @xmath2 is berge and admits an obvious balanced skew - partition .",
    "moreover , robertson , seymour and thomas proved that a berge graph that contains @xmath2 as an induced subgraph also admits a balanced skew - partition , see  @xcite , page  78 .",
