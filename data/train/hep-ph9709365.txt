    ".2 cm    one of the biggest drawbacks of the standard model ( sm ) is that the masslessness of neutrinos is not dictated by an underlying _ grand principle _ , such as that of gauge invariance in the case of the photon : the sm simply postulates that neutrinos are massless and , as a result , all their properties are trivial , e.g. magnetic and transition moments are zero , etc .",
    "massless neutrinos would be exceptional particles , since no other such fermions exist .",
    "if massive , neutrinos would present another puzzle , of why are their masses so much smaller than those of the charged fermions .",
    "the fact that neutrinos are the only electrically neutral elementary fermions may hold the key to the answer , namely neutrinos could be majorana fermions , the most fundamental ones . in this case the suppression of their mass could be associated to lepton number conservation , as actually happens in many extensions of the sm .    from the observational point of view non - zero",
    "neutrino masses now seem required in order to account for the data on solar and atmospheric neutrinos , as well as the ( hot ) dark matter in the universe .",
    "detecting neutrino masses is one of the most outstanding challenges in particle physics , with far - reaching implications also for the understanding of fundamental issues in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "though very difficult , future experiments could shed light on the issue of neutrino masses and the conservation of lepton number .",
    "one interesting aspect of many models where neutrinos have non - vanishing masses is that they lead to effects that could be experimentally tested . before over - viewing the present observational limits and hints in favour of massive neutrinos , let us make a few general remarks about the theoretical models .",
    ".2 cm    one of the most attractive approaches to generate neutrino masses is from unification .",
    "indeed , in trying to understand the origin of parity violation in the weak interaction by ascribing it to a spontaneous breaking phenomenon , in the same way as the w and z acquire their masses in the sm , one arrives at the so - called left - right symmetric extensions such as @xcite , 22 @xcite or 0 @xcite , in some of which the masses of the light neutrinos are obtained by diagonalizing the following mass matrix in the basis @xmath10",
    "@xmath11   \\label{ss}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the standard 1 breaking dirac mass term and @xmath13 is the isosinglet majorana mass . in the seesaw approximation",
    ", one finds m_eff = - d m_r^-1 d^t .",
    "[ seesaw ] in general , however , this matrix also contains a @xmath14 term @xcite whose size is expected to be also suppressed by the left - right breaking scale . as a result",
    "one is able to explain naturally the relative smallness of masses . even though it is natural to expect @xmath15 to be large",
    ", its magnitude heavily depends on the model . as a result one can not make any real prediction for the corresponding light neutrino masses that are generated through the seesaw mechanism . in fact this freedom has been exploited in model building in order to account for an almost degenerate mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "although very attractive , unification is by no means the only way to generate neutrino masses .",
    "there is a large diversity of other possible schemes which do not require any new large mass scale .",
    "for example , it is possible to start from an extension of the lepton sector of the 1 theory by adding a set of @xmath16 2-component isosinglet neutral fermions , denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 , to each generation . in this case",
    "there is an exact l symmetry that keeps neutrinos strictly massless , as in the sm .",
    "the conservation of total lepton number leads to the following form for the neutral mass matrix ( in the basis @xmath19 ) @xmath20 \\label{mat}\\ ] ] this form has also been suggested in various theoretical models @xcite , including many of the superstring inspired models . in the latter case",
    "the zeros of naturally arise due to the absence of higgs fields to provide the usual majorana mass terms , needed in the seesaw model @xcite .",
    "clearly , one can easily introduce non - zero masses in this model through a @xmath21 term that could be proportional to the vev of a singlet field @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the seesaw scheme , the masses are directly proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "this model provides a conceptually simple and phenomenologically rich extension of the standard model , which brings in the possibility that a wide range of new phenomena be sizeable .",
    "these have to do with neutrino mixing , universality , flavour and cp violation in the lepton sector @xcite , as well as direct effects associated with neutral heavy lepton ( nhl ) production at high energy colliders @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this model is the possibility of non - trivial neutrino mixing despite the fact that neutrinos are strictly massless .",
    "this tree - level effect leads to a new type of resonant conversion mechanism that could play an important role in supernovae @xcite . moreover , there are loop - induced lepton flavour and cp non - conservation effects whose rates are precisely calculable @xcite .",
    "i repeat that this is remarkable due to the fact that physical light neutrinos are massless , as in the standard model .",
    "this feature is the same as what happens in the supersymmetric mechanism of flavour violation @xcite . indeed , in the simplest case of su(5 )",
    "supergravity unification , there are flavour violating processes , like @xmath24 , despite the fact that in su(5 ) neutrinos are protected by b - l and remain massless . the supersymmetric mechanism and that of differ in that the lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) processes are induced in one case by nhl loops , while in supersymmetry they are induced by scalar boson loops . in both cases",
    "the particles in the loops have masses at the weak scale , leading to branching ratios @xcite @xcite that are sizeable enough to be of experimental interest @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry with broken r - parity also provides a nice mechanism for the origin of neutrino mass @xcite . for example , in a model where r - parity is broken by a bilinear term in the superpotential @xcite the tau neutrino @xmath25 acquires a mass , due to the mixing between and neutralinos given in the matrix @xmath26 \\label{eq : neutmassmat}\\ ] ] this mixing is proportional to the r - parity and lepton - number violating parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the simplest unified supergravity model the @xmath27 and the @xmath28",
    "are related @xcite .",
    "they lead to a non - zero majorana @xmath25 mass , which depends quadratically on an effective parameter @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to notice that the neutrino mass generated through r - parity violation in this model is not necessarily large , even though its implications can be observable . in",

    "cm    -0.5 cm [ mnt_xi_ev ]    as can be seen from the figure the @xmath31 values can cover a very wide range , up to values in the mev range , comparable to the present lep limit @xcite .",
    "the latter places a limit on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "notice that and remain massless in this approximation .",
    "they get masses either from radiative corrections @xcite or by mixing with singlets in models with spontaneous breaking of r - parity @xcite .",
    "there is also a large variety of _ radiative _ schemes to generate masses .",
    "the prototype models of this type are the zee model and the model suggested by babu @xcite . in these models lepton number is explicitly broken , but it is easy to realize them with spontaneous breaking of lepton number .",
    "for example in the version suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite the neutrino mass arises from the diagram shown in .",
    "cm    -.5 cm [ 2loop ]    other than the seesaw scheme , none of the above models requires a large mass scale . in all of them",
    "one can implement the spontaneous violation of the global lepton number symmetry leading to masses that scale _ directly _ proportional to the lepton - number scale or some positive power of it , in contrast to the original majoron model @xcite .",
    "such low - scale models are very attractive and lead to a richer phenomenology , as the extra particles required have masses at scales that could be accessible to present experiments .",
    "one remarkable example is the possibility invisibly decaying higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "the above discussion should suffice to illustrate the enormous freedom and wealth of phenomenological possibilities in the neutrino sector .",
    "these reach well beyond the realm of conventional neutrino experiments , including also signatures that can be probed , though indirectly , at high energy accelerators",
    ". an optimist would regard as very exciting the fact that the neutrino sector may hold so many experimental possibilities , while a pessimist would be discouraged by the fact that one does not know the relevant scale responsible for neutrino mass , nor the underlying mechanism .",
    "last but not least , one lacks a theory for the yukawa couplings . as a consequence masses are not predicted and it is up to observation to search for any possible clue . given the theoretical uncertainties in predicting masses from first principles , one must turn to observation . here",
    "the information comes from laboratory , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    ".2 cm      .2 cm    the best limits on the neutrino masses can be summarized as @xcite : [ 1 ] m__e 5 , m _ _ 170 , m _ _ 18 these are the most model - independent of the laboratory limits on mass , as they follow purely from kinematics .",
    "the limit on the mass comes from beta decay , that on the mass comes from psi ( 90 % c.l . )",

    "further results from the mainz experiment are awaited .",
    "additional limits on neutrino masses follow from the non - observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the most sensitive searches have been performed at reactors @xcite ( - @xmath34 oscillations ) ; at meson factories ( karmen @xcite , lsnd @xcite ) and at high - energy accelerators ( experiments e531 and e776 @xcite ) .",
    "a search for to oscillations has now been reported by the lsnd collaboration using from @xmath35 decay in flight @xcite .",
    "an excess in the number of beam - related events from the @xmath36 inclusive reaction is observed .",
    "the excess can not be explained by normal contamination in the beam at a confidence level greater than 99% .",
    "if interpreted as an oscillation signal , the observed oscillation probability of @xmath37 is consistent with the previously reported to oscillation evidence from lsnd .",
    "another recent result comes from nomad and rules out part of the lsnd region .",
    "the future lies in searches for oscillations using accelerator beams directed to far - out underground detectors , with very good prospects for the long - baseline experiments proposed at kek , cern and fermilab .",
    "if neutrinos are of majorana type a new form of nuclear double beta decay would take place in which no neutrinos are emitted in the final state , i.e. the process by which an @xmath38 nucleus decays to @xmath39 . in such process one would have a virtual exchange of majorana neutrinos . unlike ordinary double beta decay , the neutrino - less process violates lepton number and its existence would indicate the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "because of the phase space advantage , this process is a very sensitive tool to probe into the nature of neutrinos .",

    "the parameter @xmath41 involves both neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "thus , although rather stringent , this limit may allow very large masses , as there may be strong cancellations between different neutrino types .",
    "this may happen automatically in the presence of suitable symmetries .",
    "for example , the decay vanishes if the intermediate neutrinos are dirac - type , as a result of the corresponding lepton number symmetry @xcite .",
    "neutrino - less double beta decay has a great conceptual importance .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in a gauge theory of the weak interactions a non - vanishing @xmath42 decay rate requires to be majorana particles , _ irrespective of which mechanism _ induces it .",
    "this is important since in a gauge theory neutrino - less double beta decay may be induced in other ways , e.g. via scalar boson exchange .",
