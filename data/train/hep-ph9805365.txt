    "the notion of magnetic charge has intrigued physicists since dirac @xcite showed that it was consistent with quantum mechanics provided a suitable quantization condition was satisfied : for a monopole of magnetic charge @xmath0 in the presence of an electric charge @xmath1 , that quantization condition is ( in this paper we use rationalized units ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an integer . for a pair of dyons , that is , particles carrying both electric and magnetic charge ,",
    "the quantization condition is replaced by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the charges of the two dyons .    with the advent of `` more unified '' non - abelian theories",
    ", classical composite monopole solutions were discovered @xcite .",
    "the mass of these monopoles would be of the order of the relevant gauge - symmetry breaking scale , which for grand unified theories is of order @xmath7 gev or higher .",
    "but there are models where the electroweak symmetry breaking can give rise to monopoles of mass @xmath8 tev @xcite .",
    "even the latter are not yet accessible to accelerator experiments , so limits on heavy monopoles depend either on cosmological considerations @xcite , or detection of cosmologically produced ( relic ) monopoles impinging upon the earth or moon @xcite . however , _ a priori _",
    ", there is no reason that dirac / schwinger monopoles or dyons of arbitrary mass might not exist : it is important to set limits below the 1 tev scale .",
    "such an experiment is currently in progress at the university of oklahoma @xcite , where we expect to be able to set limits on _ direct _ monopole production at fermilab up to several hundred gev .",
    "this will be a substantial improvement over previous limits @xcite .",
    "but _ indirect _ searches have been proposed and carried out as well .",
    "de rjula @xcite proposed looking at the three - photon decay of the @xmath9 boson , where the process proceeds through a virtual monopole loop .",
    "if we use his formula @xcite for the branching ratio for the @xmath10 process , compared to the current experimental upper limit @xcite for the branching ratio of @xmath11 , we can rule out monopole masses lower than about 400 gev , rather than the 600 gev quoted in ref .  @xcite . similarly , ginzburg and panfil @xcite and very recently ginzburg and schiller @xcite considered the production of two photons with high transverse momenta by the collision of two photons produced either from @xmath12 or quark-(anti-)quark collisions . again the final photons are produced through a virtual monopole loop .",
    "based on this theoretical scheme , an experimental limit has appeared by the d0 collaboration @xcite , which sets the following bounds on the monopole mass @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin of the monopole .",
    "it is worth noting that a mass limit of 120 gev for a dirac monopole has been set by graf , schfer , and greiner @xcite , based on the monopole contribution to the vacuum polarization correction to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "( actually , we believe that the correct limit , obtained from the well - known textbook formula @xcite for the @xmath0-factor correction due to a massive dirac particle is 60 gev . )    the purpose of this paper is to critique the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we will show that it is based on a naive application of electromagnetic duality ; the resulting cross section can not be valid because unitarity is violated for monopole masses as low as the quoted limits , and the process is subject to enormous , uncontrollable radiative corrections .",
    "it is not correct , in any sense , as refs . @xcite and @xcite state ,",
    "that the effective expansion parameter is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is some external photon energy ; rather , the factors of @xmath18 emerge kinematically from the requirements of gauge invariance at the one - loop level .",
    "if , in fact , a correct calculation introduced such additional factors of @xmath18 , arising from the complicated coupling of magnetic charge to photons , we argue that no limit could be deduced for monopole masses from the current experiments .",

    "processes in which four final - state photons are produced , which may be easily calculated from the last displayed term in eq .",

    "so light - by - light scattering , which has been indirectly observed through its contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xcite , is completely under control for electron loops .    how is this applicable to photon scattering through a monopole loop ? at first blush",
    "this calculation seems formidable .",
    "the interaction of a magnetically charged particle with a photon involves a `` string , '' that is , an arbitrary vector function @xmath38 that satisfies @xmath39 which can be realized by a line integral , for example , the semi - infinite one @xmath40 where the @xmath41 integration follows some path from the origin to infinity . for the case of a straight line with direction @xmath42 ,",

    "we should also bear in mind schwinger s warning , in the first reference in ref .",
    "@xcite : `` relativistic invariance will appear to be violated in any treatment based on a perturbation expansion .",
    "field theory is more than a set of ` feynman s rules . '  '' ] the use of the string - dependent vertex ( [ mmvertex ] ) directly is not meaningful . in this regard ,",
    "the `` remedy '' proposed by deans @xcite and cited as a solution to the gauge - string dependence of drell - yan processes is implausible .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite do not attempt a calculation of the `` box '' diagram with the interaction ( [ mmint ] ) .",
    "rather , they ( explicitly or implicitly ) appeal to duality , that is , the symmetry that the introduction of magnetic charge brings to maxwell s equations : @xmath50 and similarly for charges and currents .",
    "thus the argument is that for low energy photon processes it suffices to compute the fermion loop graph in the presence of zero - energy photons , that is , in the presence of static , constant fields .",
    "the box diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with a spin-1/2 monopole running around the loop in the presence of a homogeneous @xmath51 field is then obtained from that analogous process with an electron in the loop in the presence of a homogeneous @xmath52 field , with the substitution @xmath53 . since the euler - heisenberg lagrangian ( [ ehlag ] ) is invariant under the substitution ( [ duality ] ) on the fields alone ,",
    "this means we obtain the low energy cross section @xmath54 through the monopole loop from eq .",
    "( [ llcs ] ) by the substitution @xmath53 , or @xmath55",
    "it is critical to emphasize that the euler - heisenberg lagrangian is an effective lagrangian for calculations at the _ one fermion loop level _ for low energy , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "it is commonly asserted that the euler - heisenberg lagrangian is an _ effective lagrangian _ in the sense used in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this is not true .",
    "the qed expansion generates derivative terms which do not arise in the effective lagrangian expansion of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite .",
    "one can only say that the euler - heisenberg lagrangian is a good approximation for light - by - light scattering ( without monopoles ) at low energy because radiative corrections are down by factors of @xmath57 .",
    "however , it becomes unreliable if radiative corrections are large .    in this regard , both the ginzburg @xcite and the de rjula @xcite articles , particularly ref .",
    "@xcite , are rather misleading as to the validity of the approximation sketched in the previous section .",
    "they state that the expansion parameter is not @xmath0 but @xmath16 , @xmath13 being the monopole mass , so that the perturbation expansion may be valid for large @xmath0 if @xmath17 is small enough . but",
    "this is an invalid argument .",
    "it is only when external photon lines are attached that extra factors of @xmath18 occur , due to the appearance of the field strength tensor in the euler - heisenberg lagrangian .",
    "moreover , the powers of @xmath0 and @xmath18 are the same only for the @xmath58 process .",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath59 , which is huge . instead of radiative corrections being of the order of @xmath57 for the electron - loop process",
    ", these corrections will be of order @xmath59 , which implies an uncontrollable sequence of corrections .",
    "for example , the internal radiative correction to the box diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] have been computed by ritus @xcite and by reuter , schmidt , and schubert @xcite in qed . in the @xmath60 term in eq .",
    "( [ ehlag ] ) the coefficients of the @xmath61 and the @xmath62 terms are multiplied by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the corrections become meaningless when we _",
    "replace _ @xmath65 .",
    "this would seem to be a devastating objection to the results quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "but even if one closes one s eyes to higher order effects , it seems clear that the mass limits quoted are inconsistent .    if we take the cross section given by eq .",
    "( [ llcs ] ) and make the substitution ( [ subs ] ) , we obtain for the low energy light - by - light scattering cross section in the presence of a monopole loop @xmath66 if the cross section were dominated by a single partial wave of angular momentum @xmath67 , the cross section would be bounded by @xmath68 if we take @xmath69 as a typical partial wave . comparing this with the cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ monocs ] ) , we obtain the following inequality for the cross section to be consistent with unitarity , @xmath70 but the limits quoted for the monopole mass are less than this : @xmath71 because , at best , a minimum @xmath72 gev ; the theory can not sensibly be applied below a monopole mass of about 1 tev .",
    "( note that changing the value of @xmath67 in the unitarity limits has very little effect on the bound ( [ unitbd ] ) since an 8th root is taken : replacing @xmath67 by 50 reduces the limit ( [ unitbd ] ) only by 50% . )",
    "similar remarks can be directed toward the de rjula limits @xcite .",
    "that author , however , notes the `` perilous use of a perturbative expansion in @xmath0 . ''",
    "however , he fails to use the correct vertex , eq .",
    "( [ mmvertex ] ) , instead appealing to duality , and even so he admittedly omits enormous radiative corrections of @xmath73 without any justification other than what we believe is a specious reference to the use of effective lagrangian techniques for these processes .",
    "apparently , then , the formal small @xmath17 result obtained from the euler - heisenberg lagrangian can not be valid beyond a photon energy @xmath74 .",
    "the reader might ask why one can not use duality to convert the monopole coupling with an arbitrary photon to the ordinary vector coupling .",
    "the answer is that little is thereby gained , because the coupling of the photon to ordinary charged particles is then converted into a complicated form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ mmint ] ) .",
    "this point is stated and then ignored in ref .",
    "@xcite in the calculation of @xmath10 .",
    "there is , in general , no way of avoiding the complication of including the string .",
    "we are currently undertaking realistic calculations of virtual ( monopole loop ) and real ( monopole production ) magnetic monopole processes @xcite .",
    "these calculations are , as the reader may infer , somewhat difficult and involve subtle issues of principle involving the string , and it will be some time before we have results to present . therefore , here we wish to offer plausible qualitative considerations , which we believe suggest bounds that call into question the results of ginzburg et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our point is very simple .",
    "the interaction ( [ mmint ] ) couples the magnetic current to the dual field strength .",
    "this corresponds to the velocity suppression in the interaction of magnetic fields with electrically charged particles , or to the velocity suppression in the interaction of electric fields with magnetically charged particles , as most simply seen in the magnetic analog of the lorentz force , @xmath75 that is , the force between an electric charge @xmath1 and magnetic charge @xmath0 , moving with relative velocity @xmath76 and with relative separation @xmath77 is @xmath78 this velocity suppression is reflected in nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "for example , the energy loss in matter of a magnetically charge particle is approximately obtained from that of a particle with charge @xmath79 by the substitution @xcite @xmath80 and the classical nonrelativistic dyon - dyon scattering cross section near the forward direction is @xcite @xmath81 { 1\\over(\\theta/2)^4},\\quad \\theta\\ll1,\\ ] ] the expected generalization of the rutherford scattering cross section at small angles .    of course , the true structure of the magnetic interaction and the resulting scattering cross section is much more complicated .",
    "for example , classical electron - monopole or dyon - dyon scattering exhibits rainbows and glories , and the quantum scattering exhibits a complicated oscillatory behavior in the backward direction @xcite .",
    "these reflect the complexities of the magnetic interaction between electrically and magnetically charged particles , which can be represented as a kind of angular momentum @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , for the purpose of extracting qualitative information , the naive substitution , @xmath82 seems a reasonable first step .",
    "indeed , such a substitution was used in the proposal @xcite to estimate production rates of monopoles at fermilab .",
    "the situation is somewhat less clear for the virtual processes considered here .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction ( [ mmint ] ) suggests there should , in general , be a softening of the vertex . in the current absence of a valid calculational scheme",
    ", we will merely suggest two plausible alternatives to the mere replacement procedure adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first suggest , as seemingly ref .",
    "@xcite does , that the approximate effective vertex incorporates an additional factor of @xmath18 .",
    "thus we propose the following estimate for the @xmath83 cross section in place of eq .",
    "( [ monocs ] ) , @xmath84 since there are four suppression factors in the amplitude .",
    "now a considerably larger value of @xmath17 is consistent with unitarity , @xmath85 if we take @xmath69 again .",
    "we now must re - examine the @xmath86 cross section .    in the model given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the photon energy distribution is given in terms of the functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the physical cross section is given by @xmath89 where now ( _ cf . _",
    "( 25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath90 where , for spin 1/2 , ( up to factors of order unity ) @xmath91 the result in ( [ newdsigma ] ) differs from that in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "the photon distribution function @xmath93 used is rather strongly peaked at @xmath94 .",
    "( this peaking is necessary to have any chance of satisfying the low - frequency criterion . )",
    "when we multiply by @xmath95 , the amplitude is greatly reduced and the peak is shifted above @xmath96 , violating even the naive criterion for the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , the integral of the distribution function is reduced by two orders of magnitude , that is , @xmath97 this reduces the mass limit quoted in @xcite by a factor of @xmath98 , to about 500 gev , where @xmath99 .",
    "this dubious result makes us conclude that it is impossible to derive any limit for the monopole mass from the present data .    as for the de rjula limit , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , proportional to @xmath102 in each case , once again ignoring both the string and the radiative correction problem .",
    "he assumes that the monopole is a heavy vector - like fermion , and obtains a limit of @xmath103 .",
    "our ansatz changes @xmath102 to @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 gev , a substantial reduction . ] from the @xmath10 process , if we insert a suppression factor of @xmath18 at each vertex and integrate over the final state photon distributions , given by eq .",
    "( 18 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass limit is reduced to @xmath106 gev , again grossly violating the low energy criterion . and",
    "the limit deduced from the vacuum polarization correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon due to virtual monopole pairs @xcite is reduced to 2 gev .",
    "the reader might object that this @xmath18 softening of the vertex has little field - theoretic basis .",
    "therefore , we propose a second possibility that does have such a basis .",
    "the vertex ( [ mmvertex ] ) suggests , and detailed calculation supports ( based on the tensor structure of the photon amplitudes , when @xmath107 points in the time direction .",
    "apart from this different tensor structure , the vacuum polarization is given by exactly the usual formula , found , for example in ref .",
    "details of this and related calculations will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] ) the introduction of the string - dependent factor @xmath108 at each vertex , where @xmath109 is the photon momentum .",
    "such a factor is devastating to the indirect monopole searches  for any process involving a real photon , such as that of the d0 experiment @xcite or for @xmath10 discussed in @xcite , the amplitude vanishes . because such factors can and do appear in full monopole calculations , it is clearly premature to claim any limits based on virtual processes involving real final - state photons .",
    "we do not take our reduced limits on monopole masses very seriously .",
    "rather , we believe they demonstrate our point that given the dual difficulties of theoretically treating monopoles , that is , incorporating the string and dealing with enormously strong coupling , it is premature to attempt to set any limits on monopole masses based on virtual effects .",
