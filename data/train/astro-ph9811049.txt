    "warm absorbers reveal their presence by imprinting absorption edges on the soft x - ray spectra of active galaxies ( cf .",
    "1 ) . these provide an important diagnostic of the agn central region .",
    "the presence of an ionized absorber was first discovered in observations of the quasar mr 2251 - 178 ( halpern 1984 ) . with the availability of higher - quality soft x - ray spectra from and ,",
    "several more warm absorbers were found : they are seen in about 50% of the well studied seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , nandra et al . 1993 ,",
    "turner et al .",
    "1993 , weaver et al .",
    "1994 , cappi et al .",
    "1996 , mathur et al .",
    "1997 , komossa et al .",
    "1997c ) as well as in some quasars ( e.g. fiore et al . 1993 , ulrich - demoulin & molendi 1996 , schartel et al .",
    "more than one warm absorber imprints its presence on the soft x - ray spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. , otani et al . 1996 ) and ngc 3516 ( kriss et al . 1996 ) . particularly in these latter cases ,",
    "improved x - ray spectral resolution is required to clearly separate both components .",
    "besides the absorption edges , the ionized absorber modifies the soft x - ray spectrum by emission lines , as emphasized by netzer ( 1993 ) .",
    "these lines contain important additional information about the physical conditions of the ionized material . whereas the detection of such lines was reported for ngc3783 ( george et al .",
    "1995 ) , their contribution ( as calculated with the code _ cloudy _ ) was found to be negligible for the best - fit warm absorbers in ngc4051 and ngc3227 ( komossa & fink 1997a , b ) .",
    "emission features of the warm material are best detectable against the reflected continuum component , i.e. if the direct component is completely absorbed ( cf . fig .",
    "1 ) .    in the last two years",
    ", evidence has accumulated that some warm absorbers contain significant amounts of dust .",
    "this possibility was suggested by brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to explain the lack of excess x - ray _ cold _ absorption despite strong optical reddening of the quasar iras 13349 + 2438 .",
    "explicit photoionization modelling of dusty warm gas using the code _ cloudy _ showed that the modifications of the x - ray absorption spectrum can be quite strong in the presence of dust , particularly for high column densities of the warm absorber ( komossa & fink 1997a - d , komossa & bade 1998 ) .",
    "another interesting recent development is the detection of spectral complexity around 1.1 kev ( e.g. , hayashida 1997 ) .",
    "` standard ' warm absorber models do not predict strong absorption features around this energy ; usually , the deepest edges are those of oxygen ovii and oviii at 0.74 and 0.87 kev , respectively . among the suggested interpretations for the 1.1 kev feature",
    "is strongly blueshifted oxygen absorption , implying relativistic outflow velocities ( e.g. , leighly et al .",
    "1997a ) .    in the following ,",
    "we first discuss two suggested candidates for dusty warm absorbers , iras 13349 + 2438 and 4c+74.26 , and predict the characteristic absorption features observable with _ xmm_. we then investigate several scenarios to explain the peculiar spectral features around 1.1 kev .",
    "the analyses are based on x - ray observations and photoionization calculations carried out with the code _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "= 7.4 cm = 7.4 cm",
    "this quasar received a lot of attention , recently . in x - rays , the presence of a dusty warm absorber was suggested ( brandt et al .",
    "1996 ) . here",
    ", we fit a model that explicitly includes the presence of dust to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "although repeatedly suggested , such a model has not been applied previously ( for some results see komossa & fink 1998 ) .",
    "given the potentially strong modifications of the x - ray absorption spectrum in the presence of dust , it is important to scrutinize whether a dusty warm absorber is consistent with the observed x - ray spectrum . since some strong features of dusty warm absorbers appear outside the sensitivity range , data are best suited for this purpose ; we used the pointed pspc observation of dec .",
    "1992 .    in a first step ,",
    "we fit a dust-_free _ warm absorber ( as in brandt et al .",
    "1996 , but using the additional information on the hard x - ray powerlaw available from the asca observation , @xmath1 ; brinkmann et al .",
    "1996 , brandt et al .",
    "this gives an excellent fit with log @xmath2=22.7 ( @xmath3 = 0.84 ) .",
    "if this same model is re - calculated by fixing @xmath2 and the other best - fit parameters but _ adding dust _ to the warm absorber the x - ray spectral shape is drastically altered and the data can not be fit at all ( @xmath3 = 150 ) .",
    "this still holds if we allow for non - standard dust , i.e. , selectively exclude either the graphite or silicate species .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , though , that the expected column derived from optical extinction is less than the x - ray value of @xmath2 determined under the above assumptions .",
    "therefore , in a next step , we allowed all parameters ( except ) to be free and checked , whether a dusty warm absorber could be successfully fit at all .",
    "this is not the case ( e.g. , if @xmath2 is fixed to log @xmath4 = 21.2 we get @xmath3 = 40 ) .",
    "the bad fit results can be partially traced back to the ` flattening ' effect of dust .",
    "in fact , if we allow for a steeper intrinsic powerlaw spectrum , with @xmath5 much steeper than the value , a dusty warm absorber with @xmath6 fits the spectrum well ( @xmath3 = 1.2 ) .",
    "we also analyzed the survey data and find the same trends . at present",
    ", there are several possible explanations for the _ rosat_-spectral differences : ( i ) variability in a _ two_-component warm absorber , ( ii ) variability in the intrinsic spectrum , or ( iii ) remaining _ rosat_-cross - calibration uncertainties .      in an analysis of and data of the radio - loud quasar 4c+74 , brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find an unusually flat soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath7 ; as compared to @xmath8 typically seen in radio - loud quasars ) , a steeper powerlaw ( pl ) spectrum , and evidence for the presence of a warm absorber . applying the model of a _ dusty _ warm absorber to the spectrum we get a successful spectral fit , with a steeper intrinsic pl spectrum ( now consistent with the value and the general expectation for radio - loud quasars ) , and a column density @xmath2 consistent with optical reddening .",
    "however , excess cold absorption provides an alternative successful spectral fit , and higher x - ray spectral resolution is required to exclude a cold absorber .",
    "besides iras13349 , several more good candidates for dusty warm absorbers have been presented ( ngc3227 , komossa & fink 1997b ; ngc3786 , komossa & fink 1997c ; mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , reynolds et al . 1997 ; iras17020 + 4544 , leighly et al .",
    "1997b , komossa & bade 1998 ) which suggests this component to be common in all types of agn .",
    "signatures of the presence of dust are a carbon edge at 0.28 kev and an oxygen edge at 0.56 kev , produced by inner - shell photoionization , not yet individually resolved by current x - ray instruments .",
    "therefore , one main argument in favour of dust within the warm absorber remained an indirect one : the discrepancy between the _ large _ amount of cold absorbing material inferred from optical data , and the _ small or negligible _ excess cold absorption derived from the x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "the detection of the predicted absorption features with _",
    "xmm _ will therefore be an important and necessary confirmation of the existence of _ dusty _ warm absorbers .",
    "it will then provide an interesting new approach to study the properties of dust in other galaxies , since the individual metal absorption edges reflect the dust composition and amount of dust .",
    "the high - state and spectrum of the luminous sy galaxy pg 1404 show evidence for unexpectedly strong 1.1 kev absorption ( ulrich & molendi 1996 , comastri et al .",
    "1997 , leighly et al .",
    "1997a ) . here , on the basis of detailed photoionization modelling of the absorbing material under various conditions",
    ", we explore several scenarios to account for the 1.1 kev absorption _ without _ invoking relativistic outflow : + @xmath9 a ` standard ' warm absorber of high ionization parameter , including a strong contribution from emission and reflection ; + @xmath9 non - solar abundances ( over - abundant neon or under - abundant oxygen ) ; + @xmath9 an additional soft excess overlapping with the absorption features ( soft excess added to the _ incident _ continuum that illuminates the warm absorber ) .",
    "the following results are obtained : * ( i ) * models of high ionization parameter @xmath10 and/or with the emission and reflection component added to the observed spectrum were calculated for a covering factor of 0.5 . in application",
    "to pg 1404 , fitting such a model improves the quality of the fit , but the high - state data are still not well matched . *",
    "( ii ) * one way to clearly change the depth of individual absorption edges , and particularly to make the neon absorption dominate over oxygen in strength , is a deviation from solar abundances , of either overabundant neon or underabundant oxygen .",
    "several deviation factors were studied between an abundance of up to o = 0.2 @xmath11 solar and up to ne = 4 @xmath11 solar .",
    "these models strongly improve the quality of the fit to pg1404 up to acceptable values ( cf . tab . 2 of komossa & fink 1998 ) .",
    "a potential problem for this model description , besides a difficulty to explain strong deviations of o / ne from the solar value in terms of nucleosynthesis , is the location of the deepest edge . in order to weaken sufficiently the oxygen absorption ,",
    "a rather high ionization parameter is required with the consequence that the deepest neon edges are those of highly ionized species , around 1.36 kev , instead of 1.1 kev . *",
    "( iii ) *  motivated by the evidence for soft excesses in some nlsy1s , a sequence of models was calculated with an additional hot black body component of t = 0.1 kev .",
    "this component was included in the ionizing sed that irradiates the absorber , i.e. the change in ionization structure of the warm material was self - consistently calculated .",
    "this causes a complex spectral shape in the 1 kev region , with the down - turning soft - excess and some ne - k and fe - l absorption contributing to the x - ray features which then sensitively depend on the strength of the soft excess ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 of komossa & fink 1998 ) .",
    "( note that the black body spectrum is _ incident _ on the warm material , and not added afterwards as separate component ; this causes a different ionization structure and therefore soft x - ray spectral shape . )",
    "a successful description of both , high- and low - state data is possible , but a rather broad edge structure is predicted .",
    "+ data of high spectral resolution will be needed to discriminate between these models , the interesting alternatives of relativistic outflow or high iron overabundance , or further scenarios to account for the 1.1 kev features .",
    "warm absorbers display many facets and may account for a variety of observational phenomena , mostly in the x - ray spectral region .",
    "their detailed study will certainly be a prime goal of the x - ray satellite _ xmm_. in particular , _ dust_-created absorption edges , if confirmed , will play an important role not only in probing components of the active nucleus , like the dusty torus , but also are they a very useful new diagnostic of dust properties in other galaxies ."
