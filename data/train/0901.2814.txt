    "the purpose of whi jop204 was to characterize the behavior of the quiet sun ; aiming to build a better picture of the relationship between chromospheric dynamic spicules , their extension into the transition region and ( possibly ) corona .",
    "in essence we hope to fully assess the role of magneto - convective driving mass and energy from the lower atmosphere into the quiet corona or solar wind .",
    "jop  204 observations took place between april 10th through april 16th , 2008 involving a host of observatories on the ground ( nso ) and in space ( _ soho _ , _ trace _ , _ hinode _ , _ stereo _ ) .",
    "we will discuss the preliminary analysis of data from _ hinode_/sot , _ trace _ and _",
    "soho_/sumer @xcite on april 12th 2008 on the south - west limb that ran from 14:00 - 17:00ut .    the correspondence between above - the - limb structure in _",
    "ca  ii  h and trace  1600 passband image sequences is striking - noting that the 1600 passband is dominated by 1548 and 1550 emission lines of c  iv there .",
    "immediately , we see that while the emission observed in ca  ii is considerably finer in structure the gross behavior and dynamics present are repeated in the mid - transition region indicating that material is at least heated to those temperatures as a spicule . by far",
    "the most easily identifiable event to transpire was the passage of a large macro - spicule across the sumer slit at about 16:08ut , see figure  f1 .",
    "space - time analysis of the macro - spicule in the sot and trace image sequences shows that the ejected material follows a parabolic trajectory ( characteristic of type - i spicules ) with super - sonic launch and receding velocities of @xmath040km / s seen some 7 minutes later .",
    "this event is clearly on a much larger spatial scale than the typical type - i and ii spicules which dominate the limb chromosphere and transition region .",
    "we suggest that the structure seen is a macro - spicule driven by the large - scale reconnection of the photospheric magnetic field on the supergranular scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the material driven upward by a shock , given the parabolic spicule evolution observed      studying the dynamic behavior of this event is made complex by the non - trivial evolution of the line profiles with the increasing formation temperatures of the lines as shown in figs .",
    "f1 and  f2 . the right side of fig .",
    "f1 shows spectral snapshots while fig .",
    "f2 shows the space - time evolution of the fitted ( single gaussian fit ) spectra in the same lines .",
    "we see the upward phase of the event in _ all _ the emission lines as the line centers are blue - shift by @xmath040km / s - consistent with the measurements from sot - indeed the cooler emission ( n  iv and o  vi ) show parabolic behavior in the space - time plots .",
    "further , we also see that the profiles are asymmetric and get significantly broadened ( @xmath060km / s , a non - thermal line width of @xmath040km / s at these wavelengths - with sumer detector b ) over the entire duration of the event , indicative of unresolved velocities or active heating of the structure . perhaps the most startling thing , and",
    "best seen in the bottom row of fig .",
    "f2 , is that the ne  viii emission of the macro - spicule is extremely weak ( only a few of percent of the background ne  viii emission above the limb ) but as the material starts to fall , and we start to see red - shift , the excess hot emission is _ gone _ ; both the doppler and line width signature of the macro - spicule disappears abruptly while the emission from the cooler lines show downward motion .",
    "the apparent disappearance of the hot emission provides a lot of questions for subsequent work and motivates the discussion below .",
    "we have been able to successfully co - align data from _ hinode_/sot , _ trace _ and _",
    "soho_/sumer for the whi qs period on april 12 2008 .",
    "the data provide a tantalizing look at the dynamic evolution of ejected transition material and its interaction with the corona which surrounds it @xcite , the macro - spicule observed clearly reaches the formation temperature of ne  viii ( 600,000k ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , we speculate that the hottest material seen , based on the lack of returning ne  viii emission , has actually become a constituent of the corona .",
    "it is probably not a coincidence that this emission line is formed above the temperature at which thermal conduction is critical in the energy balance of the plasma @xcite and that ne  viii is the coolest transition region species for which we see outflow in coronal holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we suggest that the physical process required for such a `` hot mass - injection '' to the coronal magnetic system is intrinsically not one that can be studied in an single - fluid ideal mhd framework .",
    "subsequent work will show that this is the proverbial tip of the iceberg in terms of our understanding of the transition region and its role in the heating and mass - loading of the outer solar atmosphere .",
    "we would like to thank alfred de wijn ( sot ) , werner curdt ( sumer ) and dawn myers ( _ trace _ ) for conducting the observations discussed .",
    "the work presented here is supported by a grant nnx08al22 g to swm and bdp .",
