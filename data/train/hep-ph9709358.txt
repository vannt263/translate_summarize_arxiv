    "it is known that inclusive heavy quark production is a calculable process in perturbative qcd , since the heavy quark mass acts as a cut - off for the final state collinear singularities .",
    "thus , the process e^+",
    "e^- z/ q+ x , where @xmath2 is the heavy quark and @xmath3 is anything else , is calculable . its cross section can be expressed as a power expansion in the strong coupling constant [ eq : sigma ] ( x , e , m ) = _ n=0^ a^(n)(x , e , m , ) ^n ( ) , where @xmath4 is the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath5 is the mass of the heavy quark , @xmath6 is the renormalization scale , and ( ) = . as usual",
    "we define x = , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four - momenta of the intermediate virtual boson and of the final heavy quark @xmath2 . the cross section  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , normalized to the total cross section , is sometimes referred to as the heavy quark fragmentation function in @xmath1 annihilation . when @xmath9 is not too large , the truncation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) at some fixed order in the coupling can be used to compute the cross section . on the other hand , if @xmath10 , the @xmath11 order coefficient of the expansion will in general contain up to @xmath12 powers of @xmath13 , thereby spoiling the convergence of the expansion .",
    "these large logarithms can be resummed , according to the method described in ref .",
    "first of all , since @xmath14 is large , one is entitled to neglect the terms that are suppressed by powers of @xmath15 .",
    "one then observes that , in this limit , the inclusive heavy quark cross section must satisfy the factorization theorem formula [ eq : factorization ] ( x , e , m ) = _ i _ x^1 @xmath16 _ i@xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the @xmath19-subtracted partonic cross sections for producing the parton @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the @xmath19  fragmentation functions for the parton @xmath20 into the heavy quark @xmath2 .",
    "in order for eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) to hold , it is essential that one uses a renormalization scheme where the heavy flavour is treated as a light one , like the pure @xmath19  scheme .",
    "thus @xmath18 has a perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath22 with @xmath23 flavours , where @xmath23 includes the heavy one .",
    "the scale @xmath6 is the factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "it should be chosen of the order of @xmath4 , in order to avoid the appearance of large logarithms of @xmath24 in the partonic cross section .",

    "j^1_x p_ij@xmath26 _ j(z,,m ) . the altarelli - parisi splitting functions @xmath27 have the perturbative expansion [ eq : apfunctions ] p_ij(x , ( ) ) = ( ) p^(0)_ij(x ) + ^2 ( ) p^(1)_ij(x ) + o(^3 ) , where @xmath28 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath29 have been computed in refs .",
    "the only missing ingredients for the calculation of the inclusive cross section are the initial conditions for the @xmath19  fragmentation functions .",
    "these were obtained at the nlo level in ref .",
    "@xcite by matching the @xmath30 direct calculation of the process ( i.e. formula  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) ) with the expansion of formula  ( [ eq : factorization ] ) at order @xmath31 .",
    "they have the form _",
    "q(x,_0,m)&=&(1-x)+(_0 ) d^(1)_q(x,_0,m)+o(^2 ) + [ eq : ini ] _",
    "g(x,_0,m)&=&(_0 ) d^(1)_g(x,_0,m)+o(^2 ) , all the other components being of order @xmath32 . thus , in order to compute the nlo resummed expansion , one takes the initial conditions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) , at a value of @xmath33 of order @xmath5 , evolves them at the scale @xmath6 ( taken to be of order @xmath4 ) , and then applies formula  ( [ eq : factorization ] ) , using a nlo expression for the partonic cross section [ eq : sigmahat ] ( x , e , ) = ^(0)_i(x ) + ^(1)_i(x , e , ) ( ) + o(^2 ) .",
    "for example , if the parton @xmath20 is the heavy quark itself , one gets [ eq : sigmahatq ] ( x , e , ) = ( 1-x ) + _ q^(1)(x , e , ) ( ) + o(^2 ) , where we have normalized the cross section to 1 at zeroth order in the strong coupling constant .    the procedure outlined above guarantees that all terms of the form @xmath34 ( leading order ) and @xmath35 ( next - to - leading order ) , where @xmath36 is the large logarithm , are included correctly in the resummed formula .",
    "observe that , at the nlo level , the scale that appears in @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) and  ( [ eq : sigmahat ] ) could be changed by factors of order 1 , since this amounts to a correction of order @xmath32 .",

    "there is essentially no room for these considerations to fail .",
    "they are a consequence of the factorization theorem for fragmentation functions , which is quite well established @xcite .    the validity of this procedure has however been questioned by kniehl et al .  in ref .",
    "@xcite . in their procedure , the heavy quark short distance cross section is replaced by [ eq : sigmahatprime ] ( x , e , ) = ( 1-x ) + ( e ) + o(^2 ) , and the initial condition by [ eq : iniprime ] ^_q(x)=(1-x ) , which is to be evolved from the scale @xmath33 to the scale @xmath6 using the nlo @xmath19  evolution equations .",
    "this procedure differs at the nlo level from the standard procedure advocated in ref .",
    "the difference starts to show up in the terms of order @xmath39 .",
    "recently , we have completed a calculation of heavy quark inclusive production at order @xmath32  @xcite . using this calculation , we are in a position to verify explicitly the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , and thereby dismiss the approach of ref .  @xcite . in the next section we describe the procedure we followed in detail .",
    "instead of dealing with the realistic case of @xmath40 decay , we perform the calculation for a hypothetical vector boson @xmath41 that couples only to the heavy quark with vectorial coupling .",
    "we introduce the following notation for the mellin transform : f(n ) _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^n-1 f(x ) .",
    "we adopt the convention that , when @xmath42 appears instead of @xmath43 as the argument of a function , we are actually referring to the mellin transform of the function . this notation is somewhat improper , but it should not generate confusion in the following , since we will be working only with mellin transforms .",
    "the mellin transform of the factorization formula  ( [ eq : factorization ] ) is given by [ eq : sigman ] ( n , e , m ) = _ i _ i(n , e , ) _",
    "i(n,,m ) , where ( n , e , m ) = _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^n-1 ( x , e , m ) , and a similar one for @xmath44 , and the mellin transform of the altarelli - parisi evolution equation  ( [ eq : ap ] ) is [ eq : apn ] = _ j ( ) _ j(n,,m ) .",
    "we want to obtain an expression for @xmath45 valid at the second order in @xmath31 .",

    "the terms proportional to @xmath32 can be evaluated at any scale ( @xmath6 or @xmath33 ) , the difference being of order @xmath47 .",
