    "<S> we show that a certain moduli space of minimal @xmath0-structures coincides with the modular compactification @xmath1 of @xmath2 constructed by smyth in @xcite . in addition , we describe these moduli spaces and the universal curves over them by explicit equations , prove that they are normal and gorenstein , show that their picard groups have no torsion and that they have rational singularities if and only if @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction    one of the motivations of the present work is to show that a study of the derived categories of coherent sheaves on such basic varieties as algebraic curves can uncover interesting geometry , including some aspects of the moduli spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the idea to study algebraic varieties via their derived categories , which has been around for a while ( see @xcite ) , recently got more focus and motivation coming from the homological mirror symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it became clear that it is important to take into account the dg - enhancement , or the corresponding @xmath0-structure obtained by homological perturbation ( in other words , one has to keep track of the higher massey operations ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if one takes a generator @xmath4 of the derived category , then the corresponding @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 has a structure of an @xmath0-algebra , from which the derived category can be recovered . </S>",
    "<S> this raises a natural question : what kind of @xmath0-algebras are obtained in this way , possibly for some specially chosen generators @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for a smooth projective curve @xmath7 we can take as a generator of the derived category the object @xmath8 where @xmath9 are distinct points of @xmath7 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 , the genus of @xmath7 , the resulting @xmath0-algebras were studied in @xcite , @xcite ( for @xmath11 ) and @xcite ( in general ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case of genus @xmath12 curves was also studied in @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case when @xmath7 is of genus @xmath13 and @xmath14 is arbitrary .    note that to recover the derived category @xmath15 from the @xmath0-algebra @xmath16 associated with the generator one only needs the category of @xmath0-modules over @xmath16 . on the other hand , this @xmath0-algebra itself , viewed up to a gauge equivalence , carries more information : in fact , one can recover the pointed curve @xmath17 from it . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as was shown in @xcite and @xcite , for @xmath10 one gets an equivalence between the appropriate moduli spaces of curves and moduli spaces of @xmath0-algebras .    in order to get such an equivalence </S>",
    "<S> , we allow the curves to be singular but also impose some restrictions on @xmath18 guaranteeing that the associative algebra structure on the @xmath6 for @xmath19 is independent of the pointed curve ( whereas higher products do depend on it ) , and that @xmath4 is indeed a generator of the perfect derived category of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter property is equivalent to the ampleness of @xmath20 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study similar equivalence between moduli of curves and @xmath0-structures in the case of curves of arithmetic genus one with @xmath21 ( smooth ) marked points . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the algebra @xmath6 still does not depend on a curve provided one has @xmath22 for each of the marked points . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we require @xmath23 to be ample . </S>",
    "<S> we call the resulting moduli stack @xmath24 (  sns \" stands for  strongly non - special \" , since each @xmath25 defines a non - special divisor ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the relevance of our work to symplectic geometry is due to the fact that fukaya category of @xmath14-marked ( symplectic ) torus gives rise to an @xmath0-structure in @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to directly compute this @xmath0-algebra runs into the well - known transversality problems : the constant maps contribute non - trivially to higher products ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xcite for @xmath26 ) . to deal with this problem </S>",
    "<S> , one has to device a consistent set of perturbations which makes the computations hard ( as one has to solve infinitely many pdes in a consistent way ) . </S>",
    "<S> our result tells that once we know that the cohomology algebra is isomorphic to @xmath6 ( which is easy to check ) , then we know that at the chain level the @xmath0-algebra arising from the fukaya category corresponds to one of the curves in the moduli space @xmath24 . from this characterization </S>",
    "<S> it follows that whatever one wants to compute for a given @xmath0-structure in our moduli space , in particular the one coming from the fukaya category , we can do so using the _ commutative _ model given by the derived category of the corresponding curve . in the work in preparation @xcite , extending the ideas of @xcite , we will use this to establish a very precise form of homological mirror symmetry for @xmath14-punctured tori which is valid over @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper consists of two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a purely algebro - geometric study of the moduli stacks @xmath24 ( without any reference to @xmath0-structures ) . here </S>",

    "<S> @xmath30-stable _ @xmath14-pointed curves . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of @xmath30-stability involves restricting the type of singularity a curve can have ( see def . </S>",

    "<S> our interest in the current study is the case @xmath36 , and we consider a slight modification of the smyth s moduli stack , denoted by @xmath37 ( see [ modified ] for precise definition ) , which is a proper algebraic stack over @xmath38 ( resp . , </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath43 be the @xmath44-torsor associated with the standard line bundle @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath46 is an affine scheme of finite type , defined by explicit equations . </S>",
    "<S> we have a natural equivalence @xmath47 _    as a consequence of this approach to @xmath37 we are able to establish some additional results about geometry of this moduli space . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show that for @xmath48 it is a projective scheme given by explicit quadratic equations . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that @xmath37 is smooth for @xmath49 and has rational singularities if and only if @xmath50 . for small values of @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the moduli space explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we have an amusing identification @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the grassmannian of @xmath53-planes in the @xmath54-space . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the well known presentation of elliptic normal curves of degree @xmath54 as linear sections of @xmath52 ( see @xcite ) to singular curves ( see corollary [ linear - section - cor ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a key structural result that we repeatedly use is the identification of the universal curve over @xmath55 with a blow - up of @xmath37 at @xmath56 special points , in such a way that the exceptional divisors of the blow - up correspond to the universal marked points ( see proposition [ blow - up - prop ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also allows us to deduce that @xmath37 is normal and gorenstein . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we deduce that smyth s moduli stacks @xmath32 are normal and gorenstein , which simplifies some statements in @xcite formulated using the normalizations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we prove that the picard group of @xmath37 is freely generated by @xmath45 ( this was known rationally ; we show that the picard group has no torsion ) .    in the second part of the paper we identify the moduli stacks @xmath24 with an appropriate moduli of @xmath0-structures . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we consider minimal @xmath0-algebra structures on the graded algebra @xmath57 for @xmath58 given by . as we mentioned above , up to an isomorphism </S>",
    "<S> this algebra does not depend on @xmath17 . passing to the @xmath44-torsor @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> allows to fix such an isomorphism canonically . working over a field @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> , we prove using ( * ? ? ? * cor .  </S>",
    "<S> 4.2.5 ) that the functor of minimal @xmath0-structures on @xmath61 , viewed up to a gauge equivalence , is representable by an affine scheme @xmath62 of finite type over @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> * theorem b*[=thm .  </S>",

    "<S> assume that @xmath63 if @xmath40 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 if @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the affine scheme @xmath65 is naturally isomorphic to the moduli scheme @xmath62 of minimal @xmath0-structures on the algebra @xmath61 up to a gauge equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> _    the proof follows the same strategy as in @xcite : we reduce this to the study of the deformation functors around the most singular point of @xmath24 which corresponds to the trivial @xmath0-structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , using the tools developed in @xcite we reduce the proof to studying the deformation functor of the elliptic @xmath14-fold curve .    </S>",
    "<S> our work poses several natural questions . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can consider other alternative compactifications @xmath32 constructed by smyth and try to construct an interpretation in terms of @xmath0-structures . </S>",
    "<S> given our explicit description of @xmath1 by quadratic equations in projective space , one can ask whether one can calculate higher syzygies and whether the homogeneous coordinate algebra of @xmath1 is koszul . </S>",
    "<S> another natural direction for a generalization is to study compactifications of @xmath66 for @xmath67 , related to appropriate @xmath0-structures  </S>",
    "<S> such a study was started by one of us in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath68 the naive approach of studying @xmath0-structures on the corresponding @xmath5-algebra probably would nt work due to the fact that these @xmath0-structures are not determined ( up to gauge equivalence ) by any finite number of the higher products @xmath69 ( see ( * ? ? ? * rem .  </S>",
    "<S> 1.3.2.2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that there are additional restrictions on @xmath0-structures coming from curves in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> curves of arithmetic genus @xmath13 with @xmath14 marked points    normal forms of pointed curves of arithmetic genus @xmath13[normal - forms - sec ] let @xmath60 be an algebraically closed field and let @xmath7 be a reduced , connected projective curve over @xmath60 of arithmetic genus 1 with @xmath14 distinct smooth marked points : @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is smooth , @xmath17 defines a point of the moduli stack @xmath70 . to compactify @xmath70 one has to allow @xmath7 to be singular . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we are interested in _ modular _ compactifications of @xmath70 obtained by specifying a deformation open class of curves satisfying the unique limit property in families ( see @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . often such compactifications are constructed by identifying a class of singularities that @xmath7 is allowed to have and then adding further restrictions on the configuration of the marked points guaranteeing the unique limit property . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the deligne - mumford moduli space of stable curves is a well known modular compactification for which @xmath7 is allowed to have nodal singularities and @xmath71 is required to be ample ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> smyth s moduli spaces @xmath32 parametrize certain curves that are allowed to have elliptic @xmath72-fold points with @xmath73 , in addition to nodes ( see section [ smyth - sec ] below ) .    in our approach </S>",

    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> [ cond2 ] @xmath77 is ample .    </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the type of singularities of @xmath7 will be determined by these conditions _ a posteriori_.    we will first follow a pedestrian approach in constructing the moduli space of arithmetic genus 1 curves @xmath17 which satisfy the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) . recall that a reduced curve is automatically cohen - macaulay , so we have a relative dualizing sheaf @xmath78 on @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> then the following conditions are equivalent :    \\(1 ) the natural map @xmath86 is an isomorphism ;    \\(2 ) @xmath87 ;    \\(3 ) the natural map @xmath88 is an isomorphism .    _ </S>",
    "<S> proof_. ( i ) one uses the fact that @xmath89 ( by riemann - roch theorem ) and @xmath90 ( by grothendieck - serre duality ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath91 is @xmath13-dimensional , the restriction map to @xmath92 is an isomorphism if and only if @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) the exact sequence @xmath94 shows that ( 3 ) implies that the map @xmath95 is an isomorphism . by grothendieck duality , this is equivalent to ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if ( 1 ) holds then we get that the morphism of line bundles @xmath96 is surjective , hence , an isomorphism . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the same exact sequence shows that ( 3 ) implies the vanishing of @xmath97 , and hence , by duality , of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , ( 2 ) implies the similar condition for every fiber , hence , by part ( i ) , we get the pointwise version of ( 3 ) , and the condition ( 3 ) itself follows .    we will also use the following version of the residue theorem for singular curves .    </S>",
    "<S> [ residue - lem ] let @xmath83 be a flat projective morphism of relative dimension @xmath13 , with connected reduced geometric fibers , and let @xmath99 be sections such that @xmath85 is smooth near each @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> similarly , @xmath154 hence , we should have a relation of the form @xmath155    thus , setting @xmath156 for @xmath133 , we get relations of the form @xmath157 @xmath158 let us normalize the choices of @xmath132 by requiring that @xmath159    [ grobner - lem ] consider the algebra @xmath160 over a commutative ring @xmath161 with generators @xmath162 ( where @xmath42 ) and the defining relations , , where @xmath163 and is satisfied . </S>",
