    "while the conversion from hcn intensity to dense gas mass may vary , temperature ( as traced by the dust ) can not explain the variation .",
    "it is possible that the galaxy variations may dominate this inconsistency as shown in sfr-h@xmath5 relation .",
    "@xmath3 traces sfr and @xmath4 traces dense gas mass , so the ratio provides information about the efficiency of transformation from dense gas into stars .",
    "there is a clear radial trend in @xmath3/@xmath4 decreasing with galactocentric radius . comparing with resolved data in other galaxies ,",
    "7 nearby galactic centers show a consistent @xmath3/@xmath4 ratio ( an indicator of sfe@xmath72 ) with the central regions in m51 .",
    "while the ratio measured locally in m51 is 1.5 times lower than the galactic average , it is still within the scatter . though @xmath3/@xmath4 may vary with physical environments in m51 , hcn and ir indeed shows a linear correlation over 10 orders of magnitude .",
