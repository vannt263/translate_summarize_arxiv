    "the properties of carbon nanotubes  @xcite depend strongly on their chirality or atomic structure .",
    "most notably , the metallic and semiconducting character and the band gap of a tube change with @xmath0 chiral index .",
    "one of the greatest challenges in nanotube research and application is to control the chirality during the growth .",
    "this would allow the production of tubes with tailored properties without relying on a sorting of bulk samples .",
    "the growth of a nanotube can conceptually be divided into two stages : the nucleation of a cap and the elongation of the nucleus into a tube  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the nucleation of the cap fixes the chirality of an individual tube as a change in chirality is unlikely during the growth phase .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported preferential growth of metallic tubes and claimed the selection to follow from the shape of the catalytic particles , i.e. , chirality selection during the nucleation phase .",
    "the final volume fraction of a given nanotube type does not only depend on the nucleation , but also on growth speed during elongation .",
    "elongation was mainly studied in simplistic models with carbon addition  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that achiral armchair and zigzag tubes grow by introducing kinks when starting a new layer .",
    "they predicted the armchair kinks to require much less energy than zigzag kinks .",
    "the growth process , which is driven by a monotonous decrease in free energy during elongation , will , therefore , favour armchair tubes . within this line of reasoning chirality selection",
    "is independent of external parameters such as catalyst type and temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest that the chiral - angle distribution of carbon nanotubes depends on external parameters .",
    "the key is to manipulate the energy difference between armchair and zigzag dangling bonds through the choice of metal catalyst and growth conditions .",
    "we arrive at this conclusion by looking at the geometry of a growing tube , the number and types of places for carbon addition .",
    "the rim of a nanotube consists of three different growth sites with a varying energy barrier for the addition of carbon atoms .",
    "the number and distribution of growth sites is a function of chirality . combining this minimalistic geometric approach with calculated energy differences for carbon dangling bonds on metals we predict a distribution of chiral angles that is in surprisingly good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first show how growth proceeds with carbon addition with respect to our model , sec .",
    "ii a. the essential properties of rims made up by hexagons are discussed in sec .",
    "ii b. the growth factor , which allows us to understand why chiral selectivity occurs during the nanotube elongation , is introduced in sec .",

    "let us first consider schematically the growth of a carbon nanotube . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we present a 3d wire model of a possible growth route of a @xmath1 nanotube .",
    "the growth proceeds through to addition of @xmath2 .",
    "the first carbon atom adds endothermically and is followed exothermically by a second carbon atom .",
    "the pentagon created in the first step is energetically less favorable than hexagons .",
    "we , therefore , expect the next carbon atom to be added to the pentagon",
    ". also , the creation of more and more pentagons would close the tube and terminate growth  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a carbon dimer is added .",
    "going through the series of tubes in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_a ) _ to _ d ) _ a layer of carbon atoms was grown , which corresponds to half a unit cell of the @xmath1 tube .",
    "the continuation of the process - until growth is terminated - leads to an armchair carbon nanotube . in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_a ) _ to _ d ) _ we introduce a schematic representation of the growing rim of a nanotube .",
    "the reduced rim representation unfolds the rim of the tubes in two dimensions .",
    "the `` . '' denote growth sites at which the addition of @xmath2 is energetically favorable because a hexagon is created .",
    "the @xmath3 stands for an armchair dangling bond ; it consists of one of two neighbouring twofold c - c bonded atoms .",
    "the @xmath4 stands for zigzag dangling bond ; it has two saturated c neighbours and is itself twofold c - c bonded .",
    "the first @xmath2 addition to the rim starts a new layer by converting two @xmath3 into @xmath4 dangling bonds , which is accompanied by an energy barrier  @xcite , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_a ) _ and _ b)_. the following three @xmath2 additions do not change the energy of the rim , since they only move @xmath3 and @xmath4 dangling bonds leading to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_c)_. the final @xmath2 addition to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_c ) _ yields a finished armchair layer presented in _",
    "d)_. we argue that the conversion and movement of the growth sites and the energetic barriers for the conversion determine the chirality - specific growth speed of carbon nanotubes .      in the following",
    "we first discuss the essential properties of rims made up by hexagons .",
    "all carbon nanotube rims consist of armchair @xmath3 and zigzag - type dangling bonds @xmath4 .",
    "the number and nature of the dangling bonds in a rim depend mainly on chirality @xmath0 .",

    "this rim is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]_a)_. during the growth the total number of dangling bonds in the rim remains constant @xmath7 , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 vary . by this condition",

    "a rim thus consists of a combination of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 growth sites .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 growth sites are identical by symmetry .",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 configurations do not contain a growth site as @xmath2 addition does not add hexagons .",
    "therefore , they do not contribute to the tube elongation process . in the starting configuration",
    "the number of growth sites in a rim of an @xmath0 nanotube is @xmath22 , @xmath23 with `` @xmath24 '' the minimum and @xmath25 .",
    "note that for tubes with @xmath26 there are only @xmath15 growth sites and zigzag tubes @xmath27 do not contain any growth sites at all .",
    "the growth of zigzag tubes is supressed in our model and needs an intermediate addition of c or @xmath28 to induce a growth site for @xmath2 addition , that we do not consider here .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the rim of an @xmath0 nanotube with @xmath30 can be divided into a part with a chiral vector @xmath31 that contains @xmath17 growth sites and a part with a vector @xmath32 that consists exclusively of @xmath15 sites .",
    "therefore , all nanotube rims can be divided in @xmath17 containing rim parts and @xmath15 containing rim parts . during the growth",
    "the number of growth sites contributed by a rim part containing exclusively @xmath15 sites remains constant .",
    "the number of growth sites contributed by a rim part containing exclusively @xmath17 sites , however , changes continously during the growth as is best illustrated by the example of an armchair tube . growing a full layer of an armchair rim requires the addition of @xmath33 carbon dimers .",

    "if we define the abundance of a certain nanotube chirality to depend on the number of full carbon layers , we find the growth speed of a tube to be proportional to    @xmath45    the growth factor @xmath46 allows us to understand why chiral selectivity occurs during the nanotube elongation phase . in the following",
    "we will show how we can influence the chiral distribution during the elongation of a nanotube .",
    "the addition of @xmath2 to the different growth sites will experience varying energy barriers , as zigzag dangling bonds ( @xmath47 ) require much more energy than armchair dangling bonds ( @xmath48 ) in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the armchair configuration is energetically favorable because it consists of two dangling bonds on neighbouring c atoms that form a triple bond . to model experimental growth conditions we need to consider a metal catalyst in most growth scenarios .",
    "the energetic difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 dangling bonds is reduced by the presence of a metal  @xcite , as carbon - metal bonds are formed .",
    "however , the difference remains non - zero , as electrons of carbon neighbours influence the total bond energy of the carbon - metal bonds , rendering @xmath3 lower in energy than @xmath4 .",
    "the energy barrier for the @xmath2 addition to an @xmath17 site depends on the conversion of @xmath17 into @xmath49 dangling bonds ( see tab .  [ tab : growthsiteoverview ] ) .",

    "the total dangling bond energies as well as their ratio depend on the catalyst .",
    "changing @xmath14 into @xmath54 we gain @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast growing at an @xmath15 site will cost no energy ; this growth happens without an energetic barrier .",

    "@xmath55 depends on the catalyst material , its composition and - less pronounced - on the position of the carbon with respect to the metal atom .",
    "the barriers for metal catalysts are on the order of @xmath66 for various metals  @xcite and thus comparable to the thermal energy .",
    "therefore , the addition to the @xmath17 site is not suppressed .",
    "this agrees with the results of ding _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , that the barrier for armchair kink introduction - which corresponds to @xmath2 addition to @xmath17 - is negligible .",

    "the nucleation phase might also prefer certain chiralities  @xcite",
    ". it would be highly desirable to establish an unambigious chirality distribution experimentally to clarify these points .",
