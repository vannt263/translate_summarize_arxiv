    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) detected by _ cobe _",
    "@xcite peaks around 200@xmath0 m  with energy comparable to the optical / uv background , implying that @xmath250%  of the total optical / uv emission is absorbed by dust and re - radiated at mid to far - infrared . using stacking methods ,",
    "@xcite quantified that the cib emission at 70 and 160@xmath0 m  is primarily produced by 24@xmath0 m  sources with @xmath14@xmath20.10.5mjy . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "a large part of the cib is due to faint 24@xmath0 m  sources ( @xmath14@xmath20.060.3mjy ) as shown by cross - correlations with blast data at 350@xmath0 m  @xcite and scuba data at 450 and 850@xmath0 m  @xcite .",
    "going from far - ir to sub - millimetric , the cib becomes progressively dominated by more luminous and higher redshift objects @xcite . indeed",
    ", optical spectroscopy have shown that more than 70% of these sub - mjy 24@xmath0 m  sources which are major contributors to the cib lie beyond @xmath1 of 0.6 , with a primary peak at @xmath15 and a secondary one at @xmath16 , consistently with the modeling of deep 24@xmath0 m  number counts @xcite .",
    "these sub - mjy 24@xmath0 m  sources correspond to luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath17@xmath2@xmath18@xmath19 ) at @xmath1@xmath21 and to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath17@xmath2@xmath20@xmath21 ) at @xmath1@xmath22 . the evolution of the ir population at @xmath1@xmath212 is clearly illustrated by the infrared luminosity functions at these early epochs @xcite .",
    "in essence , the knee of the luminosity function , which marks the dominant contributors to the energy density , moves to higher luminosity with redshift : from @xmath22@xmath2 ( 35)@xmath5 at @xmath1@xmath21 to ( 35)@xmath19 at @xmath1@xmath2 2 . as shown by published studies ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath1@xmath21 lirgs are responsible for @xmath23@xmath1115% of the total ( uv+ir ) luminosity density , and , at @xmath1@xmath241 , the contribution of ulirgs becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "while deep 24@xmath0 m  surveys have revealed lirgs and ulirgs as primary contributors to the global energy production at early epochs , the fraction of their bolometric luminosity contaminated by agn emission is not well determined .",
    "standard multi - wavelength criteria can be used ( using x - ray emission , optical spectroscopy , irac photometry ) but none of them is able to determine the relative agn and starburst contributions to the bolometric luminosity of ir - luminous galaxies ( that is mostly equal to the 31000@xmath0 m  luminosity ) . as of today , a very efficient way to probe dust obscured agn emission , is via deep mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "the difference between the mid - ir spectra of a starburst and an agn is striking .",
    "starbursts are often characterized by strong , low - excitation , fine - structure lines , prominent pah features and a weak 10@xmath0 m  continuum whereas agn display weak or no pah features , plus a strong mid - infrared continuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopic surveys have thus been conducted on a number of low to high redshift samples of ir - luminous galaxies with the spitzer / irs @xcite .",
    "however , these samples are limited to the bright - end of the ir luminosity function .",
    "previous deep mid - ir spectroscopic observations have been attempted at the faint 24@xmath0 m  flux level of 0.10.5mjy , but the number of observed sources is very small @xcite . to directly determine the agn fraction at the lowest ir luminosity possible , we carried out an observational program to obtain low resolution , mid - ir spectra of 48 galaxies  24 at @xmath1@xmath21 and 24 at @xmath1@xmath22  with 24@xmath0 m  flux densities @xmath20.10.5mjy .",
    "the main scientific goal of this study is to provide the first observational data to characterize the spectral properties of lirgs and ulirgs that are responsible for the bulk on the cib and output energy at high redshifts ( @xmath1@xmath20.72.5 ) . combining our deep mid - ir spectra with the available optical and near - ir data in cdfs",
    ", we compare global properties such as colors , morphologies , and stellar masses of our sample galaxies with those of optically selected galaxies to provide observational constraints on the mid - ir properties of optically selected ir faint galaxies at @xmath1@xmath212 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath25=0.27 , @xmath26=0.73  and @xmath27=71  cosmology .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs are responsible for most of the integrated infrared background . to study these two populations of galaxies , we selected two samples of 24@xmath0 m sources fainter than 0.5  mjy in two redshift bins ( 0.76  1.05 and 1.75  2.2 ) .",
    "in these two redshift bins , the 24@xmath0 m  fluxes translate to infrared luminosities roughly in the ranges for lirgs at z@xmath21 and ulirgs at z@xmath22 .",
    "this sample is therefore crudely luminosity selected , and we do not apply any other selections .",
    "the flux lower limit ( @xmath28  mjy ) is dictated by the sensitivity of the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite , as demonstrated by the irs instrument support team @xcite .",
    "these targets were selected mostly using photometric redshifts computed by @xcite since only 50% and 10% of them had spectroscopic-@xmath1 in the @xmath1@xmath21 and 2 bins , respectively .",
    "we note that all sources but two are actually in the chosen redshift bins , as confirmed by their mid - ir spectroscopic redshifts ( see   [ sec : mirz ] ) .",
    "our 48 galaxies were selected in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) for which a large sample of public ancillary data is available .",
    "the selected ulirgs are _ all _ the 24@xmath0 m  sources in the chandra deep field south goods area with @xmath29@xmath20.140.55mjy at @xmath1=1.752.4 , excluding three sources too close to a neighbor source to obtain unblended spectra .",
    "the lirgs have been selected among 24@xmath0 m sources with @xmath30@xmath20.20.5mjy at @xmath1=0.761.05 in order to avoid a large - scale structure localized at z  0.734 @xcite . to have a more representative sample of lirgs , spanning different luminosities within the lirg range , we included in our selection sources from the `` extended cdfs '' area .",
    "the spatial distribution of the targets relative to the available acs images is shown in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "table  [ obslog ] and table  [ targets_data ] list the 48 targets with j2000 coordinates , on - target integration times for various slit modules , 8 , 16 , 24 and 70@xmath0 m  flux densities and redshifts .",
    "+    one important question , which is also the basic driver of this program , is how representative our sample is at the two redshift slices .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy ] quantitatively illustrates that our targets represent populations of infrared luminous galaxies which are energetically important in comparison with other sources .",
    "we plot the contribution of 24@xmath0 m  sources to the co - moving monochromatic 12@xmath0 m  and 8@xmath0 m  luminosity density per logarithmic luminosity interval as a function of luminosity at @xmath1@xmath21 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "each of our targets is marked on the luminosity scale with a dashed line .",
    "the integrated co - moving luminosity density is computed using both model ( line ) @xcite and previously published , measured infrared luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath32 , the combined luminosity functions independently derived by three different groups suggest that the infrared luminosity density turns over around @xmath33@xmath2@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "although the knowledge of the ir luminosity function is still poor at @xmath35 , particularly at low luminosities , the critical luminosity range @xmath36@xmath2@xmath37 is fairly clearly highlighted in in the right panel of figure  [ fig : energy ] .",
    "we conclude that our targets indeed probe the infrared populations which dominate the energy productions at these two cosmic epochs .    except having higher dust obscuration ,",
    "our sample galaxies do not have extremely deviant properties in the rest - frame uv / optical in comparison with galaxies selected at observed optical / near - ir band .",
    "for example , ",
    "[ sec : redcolor ] discussed in detail that the observed optical / near - ir colors of our sources are very similar to those of extremely red galaxy populations selected by large area k - band surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the most recently published stellar mass functions for redshift slices of 0.81.0 ( black lines and circles ) and 1.52.0 ( red lines and circles ) by @xcite , and the dashed , vertical lines mark the estimated stellar masses for the galaxies in our sample . the method used to derive the stellar masses is described in @xcite .",
    "it assumes a kroupa s initial mass function @xcite , stellar population synthesis models by @xcite and the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "the same set of assumptions are also used by @xcite .",
    "this figure illustrates clearly that our @xmath1@xmath21 lirgs mostly have stellar masses near or a bit lower than @xmath38 , the turn - over of the mass function , thus probing the most representative and important mass scales at this redshift slice .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath22 ulirgs reaches much lower masses , @xmath39 , than what was published in @xcite using cosmos data .",
    "this is because the complete catalog used to construct these mass functions is cut at @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests that many of our @xmath1@xmath22 ulirgs have fainter optical magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : histoflux ] , our targets have 24@xmath0 m  fluxes of 0.140.55mjy in comparison with the distribution of all 24@xmath0 m  galaxies within the goods - south field ( approximately 0.05 sq degs ) . for these ultra - deep , low resolution observations ,",
    "we use the irs in mapping mode , with 4 dithered positions along the slit for each target .",
    "all observations were scheduled during each campaign just after the dark calibration observations .",
    "this method has been shown to be effective in reducing potential latencies left by previous observations of bright sources @xcite .",
    "our irs spectra will sample important pah features at 6.2@xmath0 m  and 7.7@xmath0 m , with the observed coverage of 721@xmath0 m  for lirgs and the 1435@xmath0 m  range for ulirgs .",
    "the cdfs field is remarkable for the great amount of ancillary data publicly available . in this paper , we make use of this rich dataset , including chandra x - ray data , deep hst images at optical / uv , ground - based near - ir data , and the _ spitzer _ images taken with mips ( 24@xmath0 m  and 70@xmath0 m ) , irs ( 16@xmath0 m ) , and irac ( 8.0@xmath0 m ) .",
    "we reduced the _ spitzer _",
    "data by ourselves , and directly took the reduced hst images from the goods @xcite and gems surveys @xcite , as well as the recent fireworks @xcite and musyc multi - wavelength photometric catalogs @xcite .",
    "most of the sources of our irs sample are covered by the 2ms chandra deep - field south survey @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "we use the x - ray catalog from @xcite for our analysis in   [ sec : agnfrac ]",
    ".      published optical spectra exist for 17 ulirgs and 9 lirgs of our sample .",
    "the redshift estimate is usually easy for the @xmath1@xmath21 sample because of the large number of features in the spectra ( [ oiii ] , ca , g - band ) and becomes more complex in the case of @xmath1@xmath22 sources .",
    "in fact , there are good optical spec-@xmath1 estimates for 9 lirgs while only 7 ulirgs have optical spectra with enough features to give reliable redshifts ( see table  [ targets_data ] ) .",
    "remarkably , all these spectra are available as fits files and we were able to inspect each of them and confirm or correct the redshift estimates of the original publications . in the case of l4900 ,",
    "the published @xmath42 of 0.978 @xcite was revised to 1.045 which is now perfectly consistent with the estimate derived from the irs spectrum .",
    "all the spectra with good redshift estimates ( according to the published references ) are reported in figure  [ fig : optspec ] .",
    "the only exception is the spectrum of u5795 ( from @xcite ) whose fits file is corrupted .",
    "the published optical redshift is not reported in table  [ targets_data ] since we were not able to confirm it . on the other hand",
    ", we include the spectrum of u4631 in the figure and table although it has been classified as unsure since it has clear mgii and feii lines and its optical spec-@xmath1 is similar to that of estimated from the mid - ir spectrum .",
    "the optical spectral lines will be used in the discussion on the agn fraction in   [ sec : agnfrac ] .",
    "the reduction of the irs data was carried out with a new software written by the first author specifically for low resolution irs spectra .",
    "a detailed description of the technique used is given in the appendix .",
    "we reduced and measured fluxes of our targets in the 8@xmath0 m  irac , 16@xmath0 m  irs , 24 and 70@xmath0 m  mips images . for the irac data",
    ", we started from the _ spitzer _ bcds applying artifact corrections before mosaicking .",
    "the artifact corrections include column pull - downs , muxbleed , optical banding , and background droops .",
    "we mosaicked the image with mopex with a pixel size of @xmath43 .",
    "the photometry within an aperture of @xmath44 in radius was measured using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the final irac 8@xmath0 m  flux is computing using a flux conversion factor of 0.2021mjy / sr/(dn / s ) , and aperture corrections of 1.84 ( see swire technical report , page 31 ) .",
    "for the irs 16@xmath0 m  images , we obtained a superflat by stacking the original bcds .",
    "each bcd is then corrected with this superflat . because we are interested in only point sources , we subtracted the median background from each bcd before mosaicking them with mopex with a 0.9arcsec pixel .",
    "we extracted the sources using psf fitting with the code starfinder @xcite inside an aperture of 9.45arcsec and applied an aperture correction of 1.1626 ( computed with a theoretical psf obtained with stinytim ) .",
    "the flux conversion used is 0.0117mjy / sr/(dn / s ) . in the case",
    "no counterpart was found , we computed also 5@xmath45 flux upper limits",
    ".                        the 24@xmath0 m  image was reduced using an improved version of the method described in @xcite , which now corrects the long - term transient and the regular short - term baseline variations .",
    "the long - term is treated as a multiplicative effect since it has been proved in the case of mips 70 and 160@xmath0 m  for which we have an internal calibration that it is due to a variation in the responsivity of the detector .",
    "the short - term regular variation of the baseline is due to distortions introduced by the different positions of the cryogenic mirror assumed to freeze the image during a scan .",
    "this variation is corrected by taking into account these distortions .",
    "we made the mosaic image with mopex and extracted sources using starfinder with an aperture of @xmath46 , and applying the aperture and color correction of 1.158 and 0.961 respectively @xcite , see mips data handbook , http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/mips/dh , page 31 ] .",
    "the flux conversion is 0.0454mjy / sr/(dn / s ) .    finally , the 70@xmath0 m  imaging data is the deepest available , from the far - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( fidel ) .",
    "we start our reduction from the raw data using the off - line _ spitzer _ software ( gert ) .",
    "the pipeline corrects the calibration drifts , non - linearity , and latencies due to stimflashes , and applies the flux conversion before computing the slopes of the ramps .",
    "we remove any streaking in the final images by using filtering on the first - pass images with bright sources masked out .",
    "the final mosaic with a pixel size of @xmath47 was obtained with mopex and sources were extracted with starfinder with an aperture of @xmath48 in diameter .",
    "we apply the aperture correction of 1.1665 ( computed with stinytim ) and a color correction of 0.918 to tie the photometric system to spectra with constant @xmath49 .",
    "the flux conversion is 702mjy / sr/(dn / s ) . in the case",
    "no counterpart was found , we computed also 5@xmath45 flux upper limits .",
    "the fluxes in these bands are reported in table  [ targets_data ] and in figures  [ spec2 ] ,  [ spec ] , and  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the flux limits in these two figures are in @xmath50 for all bands .",
    "all the flux conversion factors reported are the conversion factors applied by the _ spitzer _",
    "pipeline used at the time of our data reduction .",
    "we report these factors , as well as the aperture corrections used , to allow a comparison with older or future reduction of other spitzer data .",
    "figures  [ spec2 ] and [ spec ] present the observed mid - ir spectra for the 24 lirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 and 24 ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath22 . in each panel ,",
    "the smoothed spectrum in the rest frame wavelength is shown as a red solid line , a local spectral template as a dashed line , and the unsmoothed spectrum with errorbars as an orange histogram .",
    "each panel indicates the broad band fluxes at 8@xmath0 m , 16@xmath0 m , and 24@xmath0 m , the object name , the redshift based on the mid - ir spectrum , or optical redshifts when the mid - ir spectra do not yield redshifts ( which is only the case for 3 lirgs ) .",
    "downward arrows mark 5@xmath45 flux upper limits .",
    "the spectral template shown in dashed line in each panel is either the averaged starburst spectrum obtained by @xcite based on the _ spitzer _  spectra of 22 local starburst galaxies , or the agn template 1a @xcite if the observed spectrum has no obvious pah emission .",
    "redshifts are estimated from the mid - ir spectra by cross - correlating these two templates to the data . on figures  [ spec2 ] and [ spec ] , the overlapped local spectral templates allow a simple characterization of the observed spectra of our high - z lirgs and ulirgs .      of our 48 sources , we were able to estimate redshifts for 44 of them from their mid - ir spectra based on the pah emission features and silicate absorption .",
    "we estimated the redshifts by cross - correlating the averaged starburst template of @xcite . for three sources in the lirg sample ,",
    "we were not able to estimate spectroscopic redshifts from the irs data because of the lack of recognizable features .",
    "when plotting their spectra with the broad band photometry points ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) , it is clear that two of them ( l5511 and l6211 ) are at redshifts higher than those estimated by @xcite ( 0.754 and 0.776 , respectively ) .",
    "they are actually ulirgs at @xmath1=2.08 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ spec2 ] shows that the spectrum of l6211 has fairly strong 6.2@xmath0 m  pah emission at @xmath1=1.84 , with the rest of the pah spectrum not sampled by the observations ( lirg observations used only ll1 , not ll2 ) .",
    "the wrong estimates are due to wrong identifications with optical sources at @xmath21.5arcsec from their positions .",
    "the real counterparts are faint sources very close to these bright galaxies and usually blended with them in ground images which are not reported in the combo17 catalog .",
    "the faint optical counterparts appear very clearly in the hst images ( see figure  [ morphl ] ) .",
    "figure  [ compz ] compares mid - ir spectroscopic redshifts with two sets of photometric redshifts in the top panel and with the optical spectroscopic redshifts in the bottom panel .",
    "the mid - ir spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with the available optical spectroscopic and photometric redshifts within 20% , and the photometric redshifts have larger uncertainties than that of mid - ir spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the photometric redshifts from @xcite have a slightly lower dispersion than those from @xcite since they are based on optical and infrared data .",
    "table  [ targets_data ] reports preferentially photometric redshifts from the former study . we conclude that our sample selection based on initial photometric redshifts has proven effective .",
    "our irs spectra have provided 8 new spectroscopic redshifts used in @xcite for which ground - based optical / near - ir spectroscopy is difficult .",
    "particularly , at @xmath1@xmath21.72.0 , @xmath52 falls between the h- and k - band atmospheric windows , making ground - based near - ir spectroscopy impossible . for 24@xmath0 m  galaxies in this redshift range , their _ spitzer _ mid - ir spectra provide useful distance measurements .",
    "one motivation for this program is to use mid - ir spectral diagnostics to determine the contribution of agn to the total energy output among lirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 and ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath22 , particularly the obscured agn which may not be detected by x - rays .",
    "it is important to understand that , although in some cases agn can completely dominate the bolometric luminosity , there is an entire population of galaxies with enshrouded agn whose bolometric luminosities are primarily from star formation .",
    "to objectively classify agn , we use several indicators such as : broad lines and high ionization lines in optical spectra , lack of a 1.6@xmath0 m  stellar bump in the sed , x - ray bright sources , low mid - ir 6.2@xmath0 m  pah equivalent width , and finally their optical morphology .",
    "we note that our samples at @xmath1@xmath21 and @xmath1@xmath22 now have 22 and 26 sources respectively , because two galaxies initially assumed to be lirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 have now been determined to be ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath22 ( see   [ sec : mirz ] ) .",
    "the 2ms chandra x - ray survey covers all the ulirgs and most of the lirgs of our sample .",
    "six of our sources have x - ray counterparts from the catalog of @xcite ( see table  [ xray ] ) .",
    "two of them , u4950 and u5877 , are clearly detected in the ( 28)kev hard x - ray band .",
    "another one ( u4642 ) is detected at the limit of sensitivity of the survey .",
    "two more ulirgs ( u5775 and u428 ) are detected only in the soft x - ray and one lirg ( l5420 ) is detected at a low-@xmath45 level in the soft x - ray ( secondary catalog ) . a cross - match with the more extended x - ray observations of @xcite",
    "does not yield any further counterpart .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray ] compiles all of the broad band photometry and mid - ir spectra for these 6 sources .",
    "u4950 and u5877 have irs spectra compatible with a power law and also their broad band photometry is typical of an agn , i.e. no 1.6@xmath0 m  stellar bump and a power - law spectrum over the entire wavelength range .",
    "we note that the hst morphologies of u4950 and u5877 show compact , unresolved nuclei , supporting the agn classification from both x - ray and mid - ir spectra .",
    "the other source detected in the hard x - ray ( u4642 ) has , on the contrary , a more complicated morphology with multiple clumps .",
    "so , one clump can host the agn , but the agn does not dominate the optical - ir emission . all the other sources ( u5775 , u428 and l5420 ) have a softer x - ray emission , the mid - ir spectra have obvious pah emission ( see the quantitative numbers below ) and their broad - band seds shown in figure  [ fig : xray ] reveal a strong stellar bump at rest - frame wavelength 1.6@xmath0 m , suggesting that although these three sources may have low - luminosity agn , their host galaxies dominate the stellar emission in optical to near - ir .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the fainter x - ray sources is also compatible with star formation using the relationships from @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of u4958 ( see figure  [ fig : optspec ] ) shows a broad ciii line and strong nv and civ emission lines . considering that the infrared spectrum is rather featureless",
    ", we can classify this source as agn dominated .",

    "particularly , the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah is relatively isolated , and its rest - frame equivalent width can be measured cleanly and used to classify starburst - dominated systems .",
    "this is supported by the fact that @xmath6 is shown to broadly anti - correlate with flux ratios of [ nev]/[neii ] and [ ov]/[neii ] @xcite , where the detections of  and  indicate the excitation of the ionized gas by black hole accretion due to their extremely high ionization potentials ( 97.1ev and 59.4ev respectively ) .",
    "we used the code pahfit @xcite to fit lines and dust features together with a continuum from dust and stellar emission to our irs spectra . during our analysis",
    ", we discovered two bugs in the routine that computes equivalent widths .",
    "the routine was incorrectly applying gaussian profiles instead of drude profiles in the computation and , more importantly , using the flux of the line corrected for extinction and not corrected continuum .",
    "these bugs have been reported to the author of the code and will be fixed for the next release . to measure the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah , we used a chiar - tielens silicate profile and added an absorption component to take into account the water ice and hydrocarbon features at 5.77.8@xmath0 m .",
    "following @xcite , we used the profile taken from observations of f00183 - 7111 @xcite for this absorption feature .",
    "the addition of the water ice and hydrocarbon absorption features at 5.77.8@xmath0 m  is important mainly in strongly absorbed local ulirgs ( see   [ sec : starformation ] ) .",
    "neglecting this component in our sample spectra and other high - z spectra does not change significantly the @xmath6 estimates .    in the case of lirgs ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra is high enough to measure directly the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah feature . in the case of ulirgs ,",
    "the low continuum combined with the higher noise of the spectra lead to large errors in the estimates of @xmath6 . in particular , the error is dominated by the uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum from the spectrum . to obtain firmer estimates for individual sources , we used 16@xmath0 m  fluxes as estimates of the continuum since they have a much lower uncertainty .",
    "we have 16@xmath0 m  fluxes for 14 ulirgs and upper limits for an additional 9 .",
    "although , in general , most of the 16@xmath0 m  flux is due to the continuum , the contribution of the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah is increasingly important at redshifts lower than 1.7 . to compensate for this effect , we applied a multiplicative correction to the 16@xmath0 m  flux equal to the ratio of the 5.8@xmath0 m  flux and the expected 16@xmath0 m  of the averaged starburst spectrum moved at the redshift of the ulirg .",

    "the two results are not in contradiction since @xcite compare agn fractional contributions to the bolometric luminosities by applying bolometric corrections to their numbers ( see table  10 in @xcite and discussion in the appendix ) .",
    "@xcite compare instead agn fractional contributions to the [ neii ] and mid - ir luminosities .",

    "we assume 0.2@xmath0 m  as a conservative limit .",
    "figure  [ lxeqw ] shows that the mid - ir 6.2@xmath0 m  pah equivalent criteria has yielded the same conclusion as we stated above , that 2 x - ray sources u4950 and u5877 are strong agns , and the rest of four have their infrared emission dominated by star formation .",
    "since many lirgs are outside of the x - ray field or in the less sensitive parts and because of the limited hard x - ray sensitivity , it is useful to analyze the 6.2@xmath0 m  equivalent widths of our entire sample . figure  [ eqwz ] shows the 6.2@xmath0 m  equivalent width versus redshift for all 48 sources with measurable 6.2@xmath0 m  pah .",

    "we also plot the @xmath6 of the composite ulirg ( black dot with errorbar ) .",
    "the stacked ulirg spectrum has a high enough signal - to - noise ratio to directly measure its mid - ir continuum and therefore obtain an average @xmath6 .    in figure",

    "the values of @xmath6 for highly extincted ulirgs agree very well with those computed by @xcite . on the contrary , for less extincted galaxies we have systematically lower values ( @xmath2  70% ) probably due to the fact that @xcite do not fit directly the lines but uses templates to fit the spectra whose actual relative pah strength may differ from that of templates .",

    "if the agn contribution to the mid - ir continuum is smaller for @xmath1@xmath241 ulirgs than that for local ulirgs at a fixed luminosity , high-@xmath1 ulirgs would have bigger @xmath6 due to less agn boosting of the mid - ir continua .",
    "the good fit of the composed spectra of our sample with the averaged starburst template and the low estimated agn contribution to their total emission ( see also next section ) tend to support this last hypothesis .",
    "many of our sources have very red optical seds .",

    "only about 4 sources ( 428,4950,4958,5877 ) have very compact or nearly unresolved morphologies .",
    "it is interesting to note that two of these compact morphology sources ( ulirg4958 and 5877 ) show very blue compact cores in figure  [ colormorph ] , and are agn dominated systems with weak or no pah emission shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "this correspondence between the rest - frame optical compact morphologies and the mid - ir agn dominant spectra has also been found among a large sample of 24@xmath0 m  selected ulirgs in the _ spitzer _ first look survey @xcite .    to better quantify morphological differences between our sample of galaxies and other galaxies in the field which are faint infrared emitters",
    ", we computed the gini coefficient and m@xmath111 for the galaxies in our sample and control samples of faint infrared galaxies in the same redshift ranges .",
    "the gini coefficient , g , is a statistic to measure the distribution of flux within the galaxy and m@xmath111 is the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy s flux .",
    "these two nonparametric statistics have been introduced by @xcite to quantify galaxy morphology .",
    "normal galaxies form a sequence in the g@xmath112m@xmath111 plot and , in the local universe , ulirgs lie above this sequence . to compute these statistics",
    ", we followed the method described in @xcite using our wavelet - filtered images to reduce the role of noise in the computation .",
    "we computed g and m@xmath111 using the f850lp and f606w images for ulirgs at @xmath82 and lirgs at @xmath15 , respectively , to be roughly at the same 3100 rest - frame wavelength .",
    "we note that also the pixel size of the galaxies at @xmath15 and @xmath82 correspond to a similar physical scale ( 0.24 and 0.25  kpc , respectively , with our adopted cosmology ) , so that we can compare the values computed for the two redshift ranges . to compute the errors on the coefficients , we proceeded using monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is , in fact , impossible to have a direct error propagation since the computation of the coefficients involves filtering of the image , selection of regions , sorting of values and search of source center .",
    "therefore , for each source , we created 50 synthetic images by adding a random realization of a noise image ( assuming a gaussian distribution with dispersion equal to the rms of the image ) to the wavelet - filtered image . after adding the original zero",
    ", we rerun the code to measure the two coefficients on the synthetic images and estimated the errors assuming that they are equal to the dispersion of the values computed from the synthetic images .",
    "the measured errors are @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the g and m@xmath111 coefficients , respectively .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gini ] , we report the g and m@xmath111 values for the galaxies of our sample for which the signal - to - noise was sufficient to compute them and values for a control sample of galaxies with faint infrared emission ( less than 20@xmath0jy at 24@xmath0 m ) in the redshift ranges 0.81 and 1.82 where we find most of the galaxies of our sample . the typical 1-@xmath45 error is reported in the lower right corner .",
    "a grey shaded region highlights the g - m@xmath111 sequence which , locally , is typically populated by `` normal '' galaxies while ulirgs are found above that sequence .",
    "the three regions of the plot defined by @xcite populated by merger , early - type and late - type galaxies are marked with solid lines .",
    "the g - m@xmath111 sequence found by @xcite in the groth strip at @xmath115 in the rest - frame blue band is well reproduced by our study , although at a bluer rest - frame wavelength .",
    "we immediately notice that the separation between infrared - active and infrared - quiet galaxies is not so clear as for normal and ir - luminous local galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies of our sample follow the same g - m@xmath111 sequence as the majority of the infrared - quiet galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the percentage of 24@xmath0 m sources at @xmath116 with @xmath117 are disk galaxies and only @xmath215% are classified as major merger candidates . at the 3100 rest - frame",
    ", our study shows that @xmath15 lirgs have a higher merger rate ( 37@xmath118% ) and that only 21@xmath119% of the ulirgs at @xmath82 can be classified as mergers .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the morphologies of most of the ir - luminous galaxies at @xmath15 and @xmath82 do not differ in most of the cases from those of `` normal '' infrared - quiet galaxies . repeating the analysis for the lirgs of our sample in the blue rest - frame , i.e. using the f850lp band acs images , only two galaxies populate the `` merger '' region for a percentage of 10@xmath120% , which is perfectly compatible with the results from @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising since the rest - frame 3100 light is more sensitive to massive , young stars so that late - type galaxies appear more patchy and have no prominent optical bulge with respect to optical images ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of ulirgs",
    ", we have _ hst _ nicmos images in the h band , approximately corresponding to the blue rest - frame at @xmath121 , for a subset of 10 ulirgs ( see figure  [ morphnicmos ] ) .",
    "the gini coefficients have a typical difference of 0.02 with respect those computed in the acs images .",
    "all these sources are classified as `` normal '' galaxies in the g - m@xmath111 plot .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have nicmos coverage for the three ulirgs which fall in the merger region of the g - m@xmath111 plot .",
    "the study presented in this paper aims to characterize the mid - ir spectral properties of very faint 24@xmath0 m  sources with @xmath122@xmath2 0.150.45mjy , specifically targeting lirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 and ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath22 .",
    "this sample contains the faintest sources observed with irs , reaching the limit of the instrument capability .",
    "these 24@xmath0 m  faint lirgs and ulirgs are infrared luminous , sampling the typical luminosities of infrared luminosity functions at @xmath1@xmath21 &  2 .",
    "furthermore , they are similar to normal galaxies selected by optical / near - ir surveys in the sense that their stellar masses are @xmath4@xmath38 , the turn - over of the mass functions ( @xmath22@xmath12@xmath123 ) .",
    "the mid - ir spectra , in combination with x - ray , ir and optical observations , have allowed us to determine physical properties of high-@xmath1 lirgs and ulirgs , putting them in the context of larger galaxy populations selected at optical / near - ir wavelength .",
    "the major results of this work can be summarized as follows :    @xmath124 the vast majority of our sample ( 45 out of 48 ) has irs spectra with clear pah emission and/or silicate absorption , allowing secure redshift measurements . in particular , a third of the @xmath1@xmath22 ulirgs are drgs ( galaxies with @xmath78@xmath242.3 ) for which redshifts are very difficult to determine from optical or near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "our finding of drgs being dusty star forming galaxies , rather than passively evolving old stellar population is consistent with previous studies by @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 the fraction of agn harbored by the sources in our sample is much smaller than that of other samples of more luminous distant ulirgs in literature . from the analysis of our mid - ir sources",
    ", we estimate that their total ir emission is mainly powered by star formation .",
    "agn emission dominates the energy output of lirgs and ulirgs only for 5% and 12% of them , respectively .",
    "@xmath124 a quantitative analysis of the morphology based on acs images reveals that most of the ir - luminous galaxies of our sample do not differ significantly from the majority of the ir - quiet galaxies at the same redshift range . at the 3100 rest - frame ,",
    "37@xmath118% of the @xmath32 lirgs and 21@xmath119% of the @xmath35 ulirgs have gini coefficients higher than those of normal ir - quiet galaxies . in the blue rest - frame ,",
    "10@xmath120% of the @xmath32 lirgs fall in the merger region of the gini - m@xmath111 plot which is compatible with the 15% found by @xcite among infrared galaxies with @xmath117 at @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath124 we found a maximum value of @xmath21@xmath0 m  for @xmath74 for all infrared galaxies , independent of redshift and luminosity .",
    "this ceiling in 6.2@xmath0 m  pah strength is due to the fact that , for pure starbursts , the strength of the pah line and of the underlying continuum are both proportional to the luminosity due to star - forming activity . at @xmath7@xmath24@xmath125 ,",
    "there is a clear anti - correlation between the rest - frame 24@xmath0 m  luminosity and 6.2@xmath0 m  pah equivalent width .",
    "the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah equivalent width of the @xmath1@xmath241 sources is systematically greater than that of the local luminous galaxies in the same luminosity range .",
    "this is likely due to an agn contribution in high - redshift galaxies lower than that of local ir luminous galaxies .",
    "@xmath124 all our @xmath1@xmath22 ulirgs are bzk galaxies with infrared excess , according to @xcite definitions . stacking all the sources whose infrared flux is not dominated by agn emission , we provide quantitative constraints on the dust obscured agn emission at the rest - frame 6@xmath0 m . by subtracting from the spectra around the 6.2@xmath0 m  pah feature the scaled averaged starburst spectrum , we measured the average agn powered continuum at 6@xmath0 m , estimating an average intrinsic x - ray agn luminosity of @xmath126erg / s , a value substantially lower than that inferred from the x - ray stacking analysis in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis on the lirg sample suggests that their emission is mostly powered by star formation .",
    "in conclusion , our mid - ir spectra of lirgs and ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath21 and 2 reveal that the majority of these galaxies have strong pah emission and are starburst dominated .",
    "the compton thick agn contribution to bolometric luminosity for this sample selected with @xmath14@xmath20.150.5mjy is small .",
    "the so - called `` ir excess '' for these faint 24@xmath0 m  selected ulirgs at @xmath1@xmath22 is mainly due to the strong pah contribution to the rest - frame mid - ir luminosity which leads to over - estimations of @xmath22 and to under - estimation of the uv dust extinction .",

    "for the analysis of the spectra presented in this paper , we developed a new software package called `` irslow '' .",
    "this software allows one to exploit in an optimal way the redundancy of the data taken with the irs spectrograph and to extract spectra in a very flexible way .",
    "the software and a tutorial are available online .",
    "the code requires as input the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) produced by the _",
    "pipeline and uses the full redundancy of the data to reject bad pixels and compute the residual background of the observations .",
    "once the bad pixels are masked and the background subtracted from each individual image , it coadds all the images of each order at different positions .",
    "the parallel data of non - primary orders are coadded to identify and extract spectra of serendipitous sources .",
    "the spectra are extracted using psf fitting and the code allows the simultaneous extraction of two spatially close spectra .",
    "an example output from this code is shown in figure  [ fig : irslow ] .",
    "the optimal background subtraction is done iteratively with manually masking off all spectra .",
    "uncertainty and background images are obtained from the stacked bcd after the rejection of pixels affected by cosmic rays or sources .",
    "a biweight estimator @xcite is used to compute robust estimates of average and dispersion also with a low number ( @xmath210 ) of frames . after extracting the spectrum , each psf fit for a single wavelength position",
    "can be visualized to delete other possible outliers and therefore improve the fit .",
    "pixels with highly varying responsivity ( _ i.e.rogue _ pixels in the irs jargon ) are identified by comparing their rms values to those of the neighboring pixels .",
    "the final image is obtained by fitting a b - spline at each wavelength to all the flux values from different pixels at their relative spatial positions .",
    "the fit is repeated three times , discarding 7-@xmath45 and 4-@xmath45 outliers in the second and third iteration , respectively .",
    "we derive psf profiles using the irs calibration stars .",
    "the average profiles are obtained by normalizing the flux of the spectra and scaling the fwhm as a function of the wavelength .",
    "the scaling of the fwhm is shown in the same figure  [ fig : psf ] .",
    "finally , the extracted spectra are saved in ascii files with names equal to their spatial coordinates . the flux and wavelength calibration files are the same as what is included in the irs software spice . the calibration version is automatically selected by the software according to the information stored in the bcd headers .",
    "in fact , the calibration version is linked to the version of the pipeline used to obtain the bcd files .",
    "one unique feature of our irs reduction software is how it handles confused spectra from two close - by sources .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : irslow ] , the software allows the optimal extraction of two close sources at the same time by using our derived psf profiles , shown in figure  [ fig : psf ] .",
    "this feature has been particularly useful in the case of the source u16526 .",
    "the observed irs spectrum for u16526 is , in fact , a blend of two spectra at @xmath1=0.37 and @xmath1=1.77 ( photometric redshifts from the fireworks catalog ) , spatially separated by only @xmath128 .",
    "this corresponds to the spatial resolution of the irs spectrograph in the wavelength range used in the observation .",
    "when displaying this spectrum with our software , one can see only that the major features of the two sources are slighlty spatially displaced although the continuum of the two sources is blended . in our first extraction",
    ", we erroneously considered one single source and interpreted some strong emission features as h@xmath127 lines .",
    "then , after examining the 24@xmath0 m image of the source , we realized that the spectrum was a blend of spectra from two different sources at different redshifts .",
    "the unique deblending capability of our software allowed us to separate the spectra of these two confused sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : u16526 ] , the left panel shows the total spectrum , which is the sum of two spectra , one at @xmath1=0.37 and one at @xmath1=1.75 , illustrated on the top right and bottom right , respectively . at this point",
    "it was clear that the h@xmath127 lines in the blended spectrum were in fact only strong emission features of the @xmath1=0.37 source .",

    "<S> we present ultra - deep mid - infrared spectra of 48 infrared - luminous galaxies in the goods - south field obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on the _ spitzer _ space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are selected among faint infrared sources ( 0.140.5mjy at 24@xmath0 m ) in two redshift bins ( 0.761.05 and 1.752.4 ) to sample the major contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using polycyclic aromatic ( pah ) and si absorption features obtaining , in particular , 8 new redshifts difficult to measure from ground - based observations . </S>",
    "<S> only few of these galaxies ( 5% at @xmath1@xmath21 and 12% at @xmath1@xmath22 ) have their total infrared luminosity dominated by emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged mid - ir spectrum of the @xmath1@xmath21 luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) is a very good match to the averaged spectrum of local starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged spectrum of the @xmath1@xmath22 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , because of a deeper si absorption , is better fitted by the averaged spectrum of hii - like local ulirgs . combining this sample with other published data </S>",
    "<S> , we find that 6.2@xmath0 m  pah equivalent widths reach a plateau of @xmath21@xmath0 m  for @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 . at higher luminosities , @xmath6 anti - correlates with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , high-@xmath1 ulirgs and sub - millimeter galaxies ( smg ) lie above the local @xmath6-@xmath7 relationship suggesting that , at a given luminosity , high-@xmath1 ulirgs have agn contributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative analysis of their morphology shows that most of the luminous ir galaxies have morphologies similar to those of ir - quiet galaxies at the same redshift . </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath1@xmath22 ulirgs of our sample are ir - excess bzk galaxies and most of them have @xmath8 ratios higher than those of starburst galaxies at a given uv slope . </S>",
    "<S> the `` ir excess '' @xcite is mostly due to strong 7.7@xmath0 m  pah emission and under - estimation of uv dust extinction . on the basis of the agn - powered @xmath9 continuum measured directly from the mid - ir spectra , we estimate an average intrinsic x - ray agn luminosity of @xmath10=(0.1@xmath110.6)@xmath12@xmath13erg / s , a value substantially lower than the prediction by @xcite . </S>"
