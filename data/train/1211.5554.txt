    "quantum algorithms constitute one of the main applications of modern quantum information theory . they offer computational speed - up , that provably no classical system could ever exhibit @xcite .",
    "the crucial quantum property for such a speed - up remains a heavily debated open question up to date ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a famous way of implementing quantum algorithms is the measurement - based approach , where the computations are performed through the preparation of a highly entangled particular type of graph state ( namely , a cluster state ) , which is subsequently processed via local measurements ( introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some of the most prominent algorithms , however , are often phrased in the circuit model ( e.g. grover s algorithm @xcite or deutsch - jozsa s algorithm @xcite ) , where the algorithm is usually formulated in terms of an initialization of a real equally weighted ( rew ) pure state ( i.e. a superposition of all basis states with real amplitudes and equal probabilities ) , on which quantum gates subsequently act and a final measurement concludes the computation .",
    "thus , this family of states plays a central role in several quantum algorithms . from the construction of graph states , as reviewed below , it is obvious that they are special cases of such rew states . due to the special properties of graph",
    "states it can also easily be seen that in a many - body system they can be created using only particular two - body interactions .",
    "the first question we address in this work is whether all rew states can be created using the two - body interactions occurring in graph states .",
    "we show that this is not the case , i.e. the set of rew states is strictly larger than the set of graph states .    from a physical point of view , where the @xmath1-qubits are a composite system of interacting spin 1/2 particles , it is then interesting to ask what kind of interactions are necessary to create all possible rew states . in this paper",
    "we answer this question by introducing hypergraph states , i.e. quantum states created by using up to @xmath1-body interactions of a given kind .",
    "we show that these states indeed cover all possible rew states , by providing an explicit simple procedure to find the associated hypergraph to a given rew state , and that they have an illustrative graph representation .",
    "we also find that they are stabilized by generalizations of the stabilizers of graph states , and that , by introducing the notion of @xmath0-uniformity , they can be shown to constitute a set of different entanglement classes under local pauli operations .",
    "the present work is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ prel ] we briefly review concepts related to standard graph states . we introduce and mathematically define @xmath0-uniform hypergraph states in sec .",
    "[ inter ] , and general hypergraph states in sec .",
    "[ final ] . in sec .",
    "[ rew ] the equivalence and connection with rew states employed in quantum algorithms is proven and discussed .",
    "we finally summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ conc ] and discuss possible ways to extend our work .",
    "we will here briefly review some basic concepts related to graph states ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for fixing the notation and introducing concepts that will be useful later . given a mathematical graph @xmath2 , i.e. a set of @xmath1 vertices @xmath3 and a set of edges @xmath4 , one can find the corresponding quantum graph state as follows .",
    "first , assign to each vertex a qubit and initialise each qubit as the state @xmath5 , so that the initial @xmath1-qubit state is given by @xmath6 . then , perform controlled-@xmath7 operations between any two qubits that are connected by an edge . by performing the operation @xmath8 for any two connected qubits @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we get the corresponding quantum graph state @xmath11 where @xmath12 means that the two vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected by an edge .",
    "this procedure is sketched for an example in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] , which clearly points out the correspondence . in this work",
    "we will denote by @xmath13 and @xmath7 the identity and the three pauli matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath16 the general controlled-@xmath7 gate acting on the @xmath0 qubits labelled by @xmath17 .",
    "notice that @xmath0 is an integer in the interval @xmath18 , and by definition we take @xmath19 .",
    "the gate @xmath16 introduces a minus sign to the input state @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 , and leaves all the other components of the computational basis unchanged .",
    "hence the action of the controlled-@xmath7 gate is invariant under permutations of the @xmath1 qubits in the computational basis , thus any of the @xmath0 qubits on which @xmath16 acts can be thought of as the target qubit .",
    "we will take @xmath22 , the reason will be clear later .",
    "gates are symmetric , @xmath23 gates are here depicted as two dots connected by a vertical line .",
    "this notation will also be used for general controlled-@xmath7 gates in the next figures . ]",
    "we call the set of all graph states @xmath24 , and denote a general state taken from this set by @xmath25 .",
    "the subscript @xmath26 indicates that only two - body interactions , represented by @xmath23 , are involved .",
    "it is easy to show , by counting all possible edge configurations , that the number of graph states is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the binomial coefficient `` @xmath1 choose @xmath26 '' .",
    "graph states can alternatively be defined by exploiting the stabilizer formalism : given the graph @xmath29 , one defines a set of operators @xmath30 for which the state @xmath25 is a simultaneous eigenvector with eigenvalue one .",
    "explicitly , for any vertex @xmath31 the correlation operation @xmath32 is given as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the neighbourhood of the vertex @xmath31 , namely the vertices @xmath35 which are connected to @xmath31 by an edge .",
    "again , the index 2 refers to a 2-body interaction , i.e. an edge between 2 vertices .",
    "thus , the set of @xmath1 operators @xmath36 uniquely defines the graph state @xmath25 associated to the graph @xmath29 , according to @xmath37 it can be shown that the set @xmath38 gives rise to a commutative subgroup called stabilizer ( as each element of the group stabilizes the state @xmath25 , see eq . ) of the pauli group on @xmath1 qubits , generated by the tensor product of the pauli matrices @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",
    "the definitions of graph states based on the explicit procedure involving @xmath23 gates and on the stabilizer formalism can be shown to be equivalent @xcite .",
    "in this section we generalise the notion of graph states allowing interactions which involve more than two parties .",
    "the mathematical tools needed to achieve this are @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph @xmath41 is a set of @xmath1 vertices @xmath3 with a set of edges @xmath4 , where each edge connects exactly @xmath0 vertices , and is called @xmath0-hyperedge ( thus , a connected graph in the common sense is a 2-uniform hypergraph ) .",
    "-uniform hypergraph and the quantum state associated to it .",
    "a hyperedge is visualised by a closed curve around a set of vertices . ]",
    "given a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph , by following a similar procedure as before , one can find the corresponding @xmath0-uniform quantum hypergraph state as follows .",
    "assign to each vertex a qubit and initialise each qubit in the state @xmath42 . wherever there is a @xmath0-hyperedge ,",
    "perform a controlled-@xmath7 operation between the @xmath0 connected qubits . formally ,",
    "if the qubits @xmath43 are connected , then perform the operation @xmath16 . in this way we arrive at the state @xmath44 where @xmath45 means that the @xmath0 vertices are connected by a @xmath0-hyperedge . in fig .",
    "[ graph3 ] we show an explicit example of a 3-uniform hypergraph and the circuit implementation of the corresponding quantum hypergraph state .    for a fixed @xmath0 with @xmath18",
    ", we call the class of @xmath0-uniform hypergraph states @xmath46 and denote the quantum state associated with the general @xmath0-uniform hypergraph @xmath47 as @xmath48",
    ". the case @xmath49 can be simply thought of as @xmath7 gates acting locally on single qubits , while the case @xmath50 is the only one involving interactions among all @xmath1 qubits , namely @xmath51 . obviously , by setting @xmath52",
    "we recover the class of graph states . by the same counting argument used above , for fixed @xmath0 the number of possible @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs",
    "is given by @xmath53 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath0-uniform hypergraph states can be described in terms of a generalised stabilizer formalism . given a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph @xmath47 , for each vertex",
    "@xmath54 we define the correlation operator @xmath55 where the neighbourhood @xmath56 of the vertex @xmath31 is given by @xmath57 , namely all @xmath58-tuples @xmath59 of vertices connected to @xmath31 via a @xmath0-hyperedge .",
    "notice that , if @xmath0-body interactions are involved , then the stabilizers are defined in terms of controlled-@xmath7 gates acting on @xmath58 qubits .",
    "hence , the generalized stabilizers for general @xmath0 no longer belong to the pauli group , except in the case of graph states where we recover the stabilizer operators given by local pauli matrices .",
    "these operators nevertheless can be shown to  stabilize \" the regarded state as follows .",
    "the @xmath0-uniform hypergraph state @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath47 is then defined as the unique eigenvector with eigenvalues one of the @xmath1 operators @xmath60 , namely @xmath61 the set of the operators generated by @xmath62 is an abelian group ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this abelian group can be thought of as a subgroup of a generalized pauli group which contains , besides the tensor product of pauli matrices , also @xmath63 gates acting on any @xmath58-tuple of qubits as generators .",
    "furthermore , as for standard graph states , the definition following the generalised stabilizer is completely equivalent to the constructive procedure involving controlled-@xmath64 operations .",
    "the equivalence can be explicitly derived in the more general case of non - uniform hypergraphs , that will be considered in the following , of which the @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs are a strict subset .",
    "the classification induced by @xmath0-uniformity allows us to prove that two sets @xmath46 and @xmath65 can not be connected by local pauli operators for @xmath66 ( apart from the trivial separable state @xmath6 which corresponds to the empty graph and thus is already contained in every class ) .",
    "therefore , each set @xmath46 gives rise to an inequivalent class under the action of the local pauli group of @xmath1 qubits ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it is , however , an open question whether two sets @xmath46 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 are inequivalent under the action of general local unitaries .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question would imply a corresponding multipartite entanglement classification .",
    "notice nevertheless that for the class of standard graph states , i.e. @xmath24 , it is known that there exist states which are local unitary equivalent , but not local clifford equivalent @xcite .",
    "this finally suggests that the local unitary inequivalence of @xmath46 and @xmath65 might be a hard problem to solve .",
    "we are now ready to define a general hypergraph state as follows .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath67 is a set of @xmath1 vertices @xmath3 with a set of hyperedges @xmath4 of any order @xmath0 ( thus @xmath0 is no longer fixed but may range from @xmath68 to @xmath1 ) . given a mathematical hypergraph , the corresponding quantum state can be found by following the three steps : assign to each vertex a qubit and initialise each qubit as @xmath42 ( the total initial state is then given by @xmath6 ) . wherever there is a hyperedge ,",

    "if the qubits @xmath43 are connected by a @xmath0-hyperedge , then perform the operation @xmath16 .",
    "so eventually we get the quantum state @xmath69 where @xmath45 means that the @xmath0 vertices are connected by a @xmath0-hyperedge .",
    "notice that the product of @xmath70 accounts for different types of hyperedges in the hypergraph .     stands for a local @xmath7 gate , corresponding to a hyperedge of order @xmath49 , while the big circle around all vertices corresponds to a full - body interaction . ]",
    "we illustrate the correspondence with an example in fig .",
    "[ graphn ] . there ,",
    "some hyperedges connecting @xmath71 and @xmath72 vertices appear , and thus controlled-@xmath7 operations acting on @xmath71 and @xmath72 qubits must be considered .",
    "we denote the set of all general hypergraph states for graphs with @xmath1 vertices as @xmath73 , indicating that hyperedges connecting up to @xmath1 vertices are present .",
    "an element of this set , corresponding to the particular graph @xmath74 , is called @xmath75 .",
    "each set of @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs , for fixed @xmath0 , is obviously a subset of all possible hypergraphs . in order to count the number of hypergraph states , we exploit any possible combination of @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "since the number of the latter ones for fixed @xmath0 is given by @xmath53 , the total number of hypergraph states for @xmath1 vertices turns out to be @xmath76 .",
    "we will now describe general hypergraph states in a generalised stabilizer formalism . given a general hypergraph , for any vertex @xmath31",
    "we define the following correlation operator @xmath77 where the product over @xmath0 takes into account all kinds of hyperedges that appear . for any value of @xmath0",
    ", the neighbourhood @xmath56 of the vertex @xmath31 is still defined as @xmath78 .",
    "different kinds of neighbourhoods can obviously appear in this scenario ( single vertices , couples and in general @xmath58-tuples ) , depending on the order @xmath0 of the hyperedges that connect the vertex @xmath31 to other vertices .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ graphn ] the neighbourhood @xmath79 of vertex @xmath80 consists of the tuples @xmath68 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , since the vertex is connected via the depicted hyperedges of order @xmath26 , @xmath80 and @xmath72 .",
    "we introduce a generalised stabilizer group , being generated by the set @xmath83 , which stabilizes the corresponding hypergraph state .",
    "we show in appendix b that this group is abelian .",
    "the unique hypergraph state corresponding to the set @xmath84 is then defined as the unique eigenvector with eigenvalues one of any generator @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 furthermore , one can show ( see appendix c ) that the definition according to the generalised stabilizer formalism is equivalent to the one given above in terms of controlled-@xmath7 gates .",
    "let us now introduce a different set @xmath87 of @xmath1-qubit states , namely the ",
    "real equally weighted \" ( rew ) pure states , defined as @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the computational basis states , while @xmath90 is a boolean function , i.e. @xmath91 . the state @xmath92 is uniquely defined by the function @xmath93 via the signs ( either plus or minus ) in front of each component @xmath94 of the computational basis . according to this",
    "we can count the number of rew states , which turns out to be @xmath95 .",
    "these states are employed in many quantum protocols , and in particular in the well - known quantum algorithms of deutsch - jozsa and grover .",
    "notice that a more general class of equally weighted states , with generic phase factors in front of each computational basis state , and an explicit method to generate them was analysed in @xcite .",
    "is there any relation between rew states and graph states or hypergraph states ? from the construction in eq .",
    "( [ graphstate ] ) it is clear that all graph states are rew states , since the action of @xmath23 can only produce some minus signs .",
    "thus , @xmath96 holds . but is the reverse also true , i.e. are all rew states graph states ?",
    "a first hint that this is not the case comes from the fact that the number of rew states is exponentially larger than the number of graph states , i.e. @xmath95 versus @xmath27 , see above . in order to prove that not every rew state is a graph state",
    ", we provide a counterexample , given by the state @xmath97 it is easy to show that the geometric measure of genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite of the state above is @xmath98 @xcite , however every connected graph state has a multipartite geometric measure @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "notice that , by construction , graph states involve only particular two - body interactions , which are not sufficient to achieve all rew states .",
    "we will now investigate the relation between rew states and the wider class of hypergraph states and state our main result : _ the set @xmath100 of rew states and the set @xmath73 of hypergraph states coincide .",
    "_ we prove this statement as follows : the inclusion @xmath101 is trivial , since any @xmath75 is obtained from @xmath6 by applying controlled-@xmath7 gates .",
    "the opposite inclusion @xmath102 can be proved by the following constructive approach .",
    "suppose we are given a rew state @xmath92 , then the following procedure leads to the underlying hypergraph .",
    "first , erase all the minus signs of the states with one excitation , i.e. of the form @xmath103 , by applying local @xmath104 gates .",
    "notice that , by doing this , we might create unnecessary minus signs in front of states with more than one excitation .",
    "second , apply @xmath23 gates in order to erase the negative signs in front of the components with two excitations ( either coming from the original state @xmath92 or as by - products of the previous step ) . observe that , since @xmath23 acts non - trivially only on states with more than one excitation , the minus signs previously erased will remain untouched . as a general rule , apply @xmath64 operations , from @xmath49 until @xmath50 , erasing successively the minus signs in front of the components of the computational basis . in general , at the step @xmath0 , we have erased the minus signs in front of the states with up to @xmath0 excitations .",
    "the set of gates that are needed to transform @xmath92 back to @xmath6 provides the underlying hypergraph for the rew state under examination .",
    "notice that , since the procedure is uniquely defined according to the rew state from which we start , the underlying hypergraph is unique .",
    "therefore , the correspondence between the sets @xmath87 and @xmath73 is one - to - one .",
    "as an explicit example consider the three - qubit rew state @xmath105 it is straightforward to see that the sequence of transformations @xmath106 applied to the above state leads to the initial state @xmath107 . therefore the hypergraph corresponding to is the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ under ] .        other interesting examples are rew states employed in quantum algorithms . in grover",
    "s algorithm for instance , rew states with only one minus sign appear , such as the state for three qubits ( the minus sign marks the single solution of the search problem ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , when the number of minus signs is odd , the rew state always involves a controlled-@xmath7 gate acting on all the qubits , therefore involving @xmath1-body interactions . on the contrary , for rew states employed in deutsch - jozsa s algorithm , such a gate",
    "is never needed , since the function @xmath93 is either constant or balanced ( balanced means that the number of minus signs equals the number of plus signs ) , while the application of a controlled @xmath7 gate acting on all qubits would change just one sign in the @xmath1-qubit state , therefore necessarily leading to an unbalanced function .",
    "an explicit example of a balanced state is given by modifying the state in ( [ pm ] ) such that a plus sign is in front of the component @xmath108 .",
    "such a state would be generated by a sequence of the @xmath109 and the @xmath110 gates , without the application of @xmath111 .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the class of quantum hypergraph states , which are associated to corresponding mathematical hypergraphs and are stabilized by nonlocal observables .",
    "we introduced the notion of @xmath0-uniformity and proved that this gives rise to classes of states which are inequivalent under the action of the local pauli group .",
    "we showed that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of hypergraph states and the set of real equally weighted states , which are essential for quantum algorithms .",
    "a constructive method was introduced which allows us to generate the hypergraph underlying a given real equally weighted state , i.e. a quantum state encoding a given boolean function @xmath93 .",
    "we have discussed the types of many - body interactions needed to generate general hypergraph states in a hamiltonian description , going beyond the two - body interaction that characterises graph states .    for future studies , since the class of hypergraph states naturally generalises the class of graph states , it will be of great interest to ask whether some of the many results about the latter , such as for instance measurement - based quantum computing @xcite , entanglement witnessing @xcite , and quantum error correcting techniques @xcite , can be extended to the former .",
    "some achievement in this sense already exists , mainly related to purification protocols @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this larger class of states may enable even more applications and quantum protocols , especially in connection to already existing algorithms employing hypergraphs , as e.g. the 3-sat problem @xcite .    while finishing this manuscript we learnt about related work @xcite which contains a similar analysis .",
    "subsequent works by some of the same authors address the issues of the characterization of three - qubit hypergraph states @xcite , and the relationship among hypergraph states , locally maximally entangleable states and @xmath112 states @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we prove that every @xmath0-uniform hypergraph state can not be transformed to any other @xmath113-uniform hypergraph with @xmath66 , by the only action of local pauli operators , namely @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",

    "this is because we can think to commute the two operators @xmath174 and @xmath175 by following a step - by - step procedure consisting in swapping each term @xmath184 of @xmath174 with the corresponding term @xmath185 of @xmath175 .    in order to prove eq .",
