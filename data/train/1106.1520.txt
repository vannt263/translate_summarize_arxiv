    "the behavior of solid @xmath0he , and of quantum crystals in general ( e.g. , h@xmath4 and ne ) , is exceptionally so rich that despite having been investigated for more than about eight decades is to this day not yet completely understood .",
    "one example of helium s intriguing nature is its elasticity .",
    "experimental studies on the elastic properties of hcp @xmath0he were already conducted by wanner , crepeau and greywall in the early seventies .",
    "@xcite those original works consisted of series of sound - velocity measurements performed at thermodynamic conditions relatively close to the stability domain of the liquid , namely @xmath5  k and @xmath6  bar . with the advance of time and technology cryogenic and crystal growth techniques",
    "have been improved so notably that at present is possible to analyze practically defect - free @xmath0he samples at just few mk in the laboratory .",
    "recently , beamish and collaborators have developed a new experimental technique that has allowed them to measure directly the shear modulus @xmath7 of hcp @xmath0he under extremely low strains and frequencies .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of @xmath7 within the temperature interval @xmath8  k has been determined and a striking resemblance with non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) data obtained in torsional oscillator experiments  @xcite has been unravelled .",
    "specifically , the value of the ncri and shear modulus of helium increases about @xmath9  % as the temperature is lowered down to @xmath10  k. despite beamish _",
    "_ s findings have been initially rationalized in terms of pinning  ( unpinning ) of dislocations induced by the presence of static  ( mobile ) @xmath11he impurities ,  @xcite it remains to be clarified whether the cited experimental similarities must be regarded simply as coincidental or contrarily correspond to manifestations of a same and unique quantum phenomenon known as supersolidity .",
    "@xcite    simulation techniques have been demonstrated as invaluable tools for predicting and accurately characterizing the energetic and structural properties of quantum solids .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , computational studies on the elasticity of solid @xmath0he so far have been very infrequent .",
    "to the best of our knowledgement , there exists only one recent work by pessoa _",
    "in which the shear modulus of solid helium has been explicitly calculated from first - principles .",
    "@xcite this computational scarcity strongly contrasts with research done in other fields like classical solid state theory and/or high pressure physics , where estimation of the elastic properties of materials ( e.g. strain - stress tensor , grneisen parameters , vibrational phonon frequencies , etc . ) is a standard .",
    "@xcite the likely explanation for such a constrast ( besides no particular enthusiasm in the matter prior to beamish _",
    "_ experiments ) are the technical difficulties encountered in modeling of bosonic quantum effects , namely atomic delocalization , anharmonicity and particle exchanges .",
    "these quantum atomic effects are indeed crucial to comprehend the nature of solid @xmath0he at low temperatures and , as a matter of fact , customary harmonic and quasi - harmonic computational approaches  @xcite can not be used to obtain a reliable picture of it .    here ,",
    "we present a computational study of the elastic properties of perfect ( e.g. free of defects ) solid @xmath0he in the hcp structure based on the diffusion monte carlo approach .",
    "this work is intended to improve our understanding of how solid helium reacts to external strains / stresses , and further extends the work initiated by pessoa _",

    "@xcite in particular , we provide the zero - temperature dependence of helium elastic constants and related quantities ( e.g. sound velocities , grneisen parameters and the debye temperature ) on pressure up to @xmath2  bar .",
    "our results are compared to experimental data and other calculations whenever is possible and , as it will be shown later on , good agreement among them is generally found .",
    "the computational method that we employ is fully quantum and virtually exact ( i.e. , in principle only affected by statistical uncertainties ) so that from a technical point of view our study also represents an improvement with respect to previous first - principles work  @xcite based on variational monte carlo calculations ( i. e. , subjected to statistical and importance sampling biases ) .",

    "it is our intention to analyze the elastic behavior of @xmath0he at negative pressures using the computational technique described here . in doing this",
    ", we expect to be able to determine its spinodal density limit ( that is , the density at which the elastic constants vanish ) rigorously , and also characterize the pressure dependence of the tranverse and basal sound velocities near it .",
    "also we are interested in applying our formalism to the study of the ground - state of defective hcp @xmath0he ( for instance , by introducing vacancies ) , where the supersolid state of matter clearly manifests . in doing this ,",
    "we expect to gather quantitative knowledge on the relationship ( if any ) between elasticity and supersolidity and so to help to understand the origins of recent shear modulus observations .",
