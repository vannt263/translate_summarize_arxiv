    "the key differences are : ( 1 ) in the unipotent case , local selmer conditions are natural and necessary , involving a refined _ selmer scheme_.    \\(2 ) it is more practical to formulate the conjecture in terms of the local image at @xmath7 of the selmer scheme , since this is what is directly relevant to the motivating problem of locating the global points inside the local points .",

    "meanwhile , the albanese maps are compatible with localization @xmath66 and each @xmath67 is an algebraic map .",

    "the point of this conjecture is that @xmath80 should be computable in principle , suggesting a method of computing @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that an appropriate generalization of this conjecture to number fields would open up also the possibility of providing a priori the initial requirement of a base - point .",
    "such a generalization will be discussed in a subsequent paper .    the idea behind computability",
    "has an easy local portion coming from @xmath7-adic hodge theory and the theory of the de rham / crystalline fundamental group ( @xcite , section 2 ) , whereby we get a description of @xmath85 as @xmath86 where each coordinate @xmath87 is a @xmath7-adic analytic function defined by iterated coleman integrals @xmath88 of differential forms on @xmath27 .",
    "that is to say , the triangle on the right of the diagram @xmath89 is essentially completely understood .",
    "the difficult part is to compute @xmath90 which should be accessible in principle , being an algebraic map between affine @xmath1-schemes .",
    "more precisely , we would like to compute the defining ideal @xmath91 for the image of the global selmer scheme at level @xmath74 : @xmath92\\subset h^1_f(g_p , u_n)=\\a^{r_n},\\ ] ] from which we wish to get the set @xmath93 as zeros of @xmath94 , as @xmath95 runs over the generators of @xmath96 .",
    "now , as soon as @xmath97 , @xmath80 must be finite ( @xcite , section 3 ) , so we are in any case investigating a finite discrepancy @xmath98 as discussed elsewhere ( loc .",
    "cit . ) , standard motivic conjectures ( fontaine - mazur - jannsen , bloch - kato ) imply that for @xmath74 large , @xmath99 and , in fact , the larger ideal contains elements that are algebraically independent of the elements in @xmath100 .",
    "so something in the common zero set for all @xmath74 should be there for a good reason , hopefully , that of being a global point .",
    "somewhat unfortunately , this vague expectation is all that can be offered at present as theoretical basis for the conjecture .",
    "incidentally , we remark that the said implication of motivic conjectures , in particular , @xmath97 for @xmath84 , has been proved in a range of cases , including @xmath2 , cm elliptic curves minus their origins , and curves of higher genus whose jacobians have cm @xcite .",
    "to give some flavour of the way the general strategy might work , we state here without detail a few simple results indicating computablity .",

    "then @xmath102 if @xmath103 . if @xmath104 , then @xmath105 if the value of the @xmath7-adic dilogarithm @xmath106 at a sixth root of 1 is non - zero .",
    "the genus one case is more complicated .",
    "let @xmath107 , where @xmath36 is the regular minimal model of an elliptic curve with semi - stable reduction everywhere and let @xmath16 be the integral tangent vector at @xmath37 dual to @xmath108 ( in the usual weierstrass coordinates ) .",

    ", this equation becomes @xmath121 but the general situation can yield a large number of @xmath122 s that contribute potential zeros in @xmath123 .",
    "nevertheless , our experiments thus far indicate that all but those containing integral points are empty .",
    "after we have established the relation to the @xmath7-adic height function @xmath124 in sections 3 and 5 , we will see that in the rank zero case , the equality @xmath125 is essentially an exactness statement for the sequence @xmath126 in a manner reminiscent of class field theory . since the map @xmath124 is quadratic , exactness here",
    "should be understood in the sense of pointed sets .",
    "of course , this can not hold literally , since we could take the image of an integral point in @xmath127 and move it inside its residue disk just at one @xmath8 without changing the height . the formula @xmath128 ` the projection to the @xmath7-component ' , is one recasting of this exactness that absorbs the ambiguity .    in the light of conjecture 1.1 , it is interesting to consider the possibility that the equations in theorem 1.3 define the _ integral torsion points _ even when @xmath36 has higher rank .",
    "we will investigate this briefly in section 5 .    in the bulk of the paper , we will discuss results and numerical evidence for conjecture 1.1 mostly for the two simple cases described above , putting off for now a systematic study of , say , compact curves of genus 2 .",
    "the upshot is that the conjecture is true in level 2 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath36 of rank zero , in all cases we have tested numerically .",
    "nonetheless , we are obviously not yet dealing with situations where the conjecture can be ` applied ' in any sense .",
    "let @xmath131 and @xmath17 be topological groups with @xmath131 acting continuously on @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath132 be a closed normal subgroup . then there is an exact sequence of pointed sets @xmath133    recall that continous cohomology is defined ( @xcite , section 1 ) as @xmath134 where @xmath135 consists of the continuous maps @xmath136 such that @xmath137 while @xmath138 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "then @xmath147 for all @xmath144 .",
    "thus , @xmath148 for all @xmath149 and @xmath144 .",
    "since this also implies @xmath150 , we get@xmath151 for all @xmath149 and @xmath144 .",
    "that is , @xmath16 factors to a cocycle @xmath152 which is continuous since @xmath153 has the quotient topology .    with the notation of the previous section , if @xmath154 and @xmath58 are two finite sets of primes that contain all primes of bad reduction and @xmath7 , the natural restriction maps @xmath155 induce isomorphisms of selmer schemes .",
    "( and hence , we omit @xmath58 from the notation for selmer schemes . )",
    "we need only consider an enlargement of @xmath58 to @xmath156 .",
    "it suffices to argue at the level of points in arbitrary @xmath1 algebras @xmath157 ( @xcite , section 1 ) , which we will omit from the notation .",
    "we will provisionally put the sets of primes into the notation as @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "clearly @xmath160 .",
    "recall that @xmath58 contains already all primes of bad reduction and @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the action of @xmath161 for every prime @xmath162 on @xmath163 is unramified .",
    "thus , the image of @xmath164 in @xmath165 is trivial @xcite . that is , when @xmath162",
    ", for a cohomology class in @xmath166 , the condition of locally belonging to the image of @xmath64 is actually the same as triviality at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath146 goes to zero under any of the restriction maps @xmath167 since the @xmath168 act trivially on @xmath163 , this implies that @xmath146 goes to zero under the restriction map @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the subgroup generated by @xmath168 for @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , @xmath146 comes from @xmath171 . by the commutativity of the triangle @xmath172",
    "the local conditions remain the same for both space , and hence , @xmath173    the subset @xmath174 is independent of the choice of @xmath58 .",
    "now we consider the possibility of a change of base - point from @xmath16 to @xmath146 .",
    "for this discussion , we will write @xmath175 and @xmath176 for the @xmath1-pro - unipotent fundamental groups with base - points at @xmath16 and @xmath146 respectively . denote by @xmath177 the torsor of @xmath1-unipotent paths from @xmath16 to @xmath14 ( @xmath47 in the previous section ) .",

    "this construction defines a map from the groupoid of @xmath175 torsors to the groupoid of @xmath176-torsors .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath146 are both integral , then @xmath183 maps unramified torsors at @xmath184 to unramified torsors and crystalline torsors at @xmath7 to crystalline torsors .",
    "the condition of being unramified at @xmath59 is given by triviality under the restriction map @xmath185 while the crystalline condition is given by triviality under the map @xmath186 but since @xmath187 is itself unramified at @xmath75 and crystalline at @xmath7 , both conditions are preserved by the functor .",
    "that is , we are assured of an isomorphism @xmath188 meanwhile , since @xmath189 torsors of paths are preserved under the functor .",
    "so we conclude    the functor @xmath190 induces an isomorphism of selmer schemes with respect to @xmath175 and @xmath176 , so that conjecture ( 1.1 ) is independent of the base - point .",
