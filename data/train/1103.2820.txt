    "quantization of chern - simons gauge field theory has garnered much interest in the last twenty years .",
    "there are several different ways that the theory can successfully be quantized , and they relate diverse areas in mathematics and physics .",
    "the path - integral approach  @xcite shed light on the relation between chern - simons theory , knot invariants and conformal field theory .",
    "geometric quantization  @xcite gave a general three - dimensional quantization .",
    "canonical quantization can be performed using either a real polarization  @xcite , or a complex polarization and coherent states  @xcite , and a general theory has been developed using quantum groups  @xcite .",
    "chern - simons is a topological field theory which does not depend on details of the geometry of the space - time on which it is defined , rather only the topological features . in particular , since its action is an integral of 3-form , it is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the underlying space - time .",
    "like gauge transformations , diffeomorphisms split into two types , small diffeomorphisms which can be continually deformed to the identity and large diffeomorphisms which can not .",
    "the quotient group of all the diffeomorphisms by small diffeomorphisms is called mapping class group ( mcg ) . in chern - simons theory ,",
    "small diffeomorphisms are equivalent with small gauge transformations on shell , and can be fixed at the classical level . on the other hand , mcg , as well as",
    "the large gauge transformations ( lgt ) group , are discrete symmetries of the theory and there is no requirement that quantum states should be invariant .",
    "instead , they should carry representations of these groups .",
    "it is generally an interesting question to ask what representations are allowed . in this paper , we shall address this question in the context of @xmath0 chern - simons theory .",
    "the example of chern - simons theory with a @xmath0 gauge group is particularly tractable in that quantization can be done very explicitly . when the spacetime manifold is the product @xmath1 , with @xmath5 the time and @xmath2 a two - dimensional orientable surface , explicit wave - functions can be obtained  @xcite and shown to have an interesting relationship to rational conformal field theory .    in this paper",
    ", we shall revisit the quantization of @xmath0 chern - simons theory on closed orientable surfaces .",
    "our goal is to examine role of the mcg of the surface in quantizing the theory .",
    "we find the following results .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the mcg is quantizable and we shall find its representation explicitly .",
    "if we seek quantization with a finite dimensional hilbert space , we find that it is possible only when the parameter @xmath3 ( in eq.([chernsimonsaction ] ) ) is a rational number .",
    "this result is known from previous works @xcite . in these works and in ref .",
    "@xcite , when @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 coprime , it was stated that @xmath7 ( or @xmath3 in  @xcite ) must be an even integer .",
    "our results differ qualitatively from these quantizations and depend on the genus .",
    "when the genus is one ( @xmath2 is the 2-torus ) , @xmath3 can be any rational number .",
    "for higher genus , one of @xmath7 or @xmath8 must be even .",
    "moreover , by incorporating mcg , we find that for a given @xmath3 , the representations of the holonomy group and lgt group become unique , and the representation for mcg is also unique , apart from an arbitrary unitary sub - representation which acts on the holonomy group and lgt group trivially .",
    "generally , at the classical level , when @xmath2 has genus @xmath9 , the group of large gauge transformations is @xmath10 .",
    "we find that , commensurate with results of ref .",
    "@xcite , this discrete group is realized undeformed at the quantum level only when @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "however , even in that case , we find that , augmenting the quantization with the requirement that the hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the mcg , restricts the representation of the large gauge transformations to those where states are strictly invariant ( theta angles associated with large gauge transforms vanish ) .",
    "furthermore , we shall show that , when @xmath3 is rational but not integer - valued , the discrete group of large gauge transformations , which was abelian at the classical level , obtains a 2-cocycle and becomes a clock algebra  @xcite .",
    "we find an interesting @xmath11 duality of the representations of the homology group and the large gauge group which , with the restrictions on @xmath3 stated above , is compatible with our quantization of the mcg .",
    "the reader might wonder why , in a topological field theory , where the action does not depend on the metric , the quantization of the mcg could be an issue at all . in order to do canonical quantization",
    ", we must choose a set canonical variables and , to quantize , we must further choose a polarization .",
    "it is the latter which is not generally covariant .",
    "then , covariance needs to be restored by quantizing the mcg . as we shall show ,",
    "the quantization of the mcg is non - trivial and , as we have discussed above , it can only be carried out with some restrictions on @xmath3 and even then it poses restrictions on certain parameters which arise naturally in the quantization of the theory .",
    "see also the discussions in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will review the properties of classical chern - simons theory . because mcgs for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 have different explicit presentations , in section 3 , 4 and 5 we will quantize the phase space and then the mcg for those three cases respectively .",
    "chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath0 has the action which has gauge symmetry @xmath15 , where @xmath9 is a @xmath0-valued function . we shall consider the hamiltonian approach on a 3-manifold @xmath1 where @xmath5 is time and @xmath2 is a closed oriented 2-manifold .",
    "the 1-form field @xmath16 defined on @xmath17 can be decomposed as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the temporal component and @xmath20 the components on @xmath21 .",
    "the chern - simons action is decomposed as where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the exterior differentiation operators on @xmath5 and @xmath2 respectively . in the above action",
    ", @xmath19 acts as a lagrange multiplier and enforces the constraint that the connection on @xmath2 is flat , @xmath24 . in the meantime , @xmath19 is integrated over . by an abuse of notation",
    ", we use @xmath16 to denote @xmath20 from now on .    by hodge decomposition",
    ", any 1-form field @xmath16 can be written as where @xmath25 is the adjoint to @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a 0-form , @xmath28 is a 2-form , @xmath29 is a harmonic 1-form , and @xmath30 are all @xmath31-valued . by the equation of motion @xmath32",
    ", we get @xmath33 .",
    "because any @xmath31-valued function can be continuously deformed to zero , the term @xmath34 can be eliminated by a small gauge transformation .",
    "there are still large gauge transformations to consider , which have gauge function with nonzero winding number around some non - trivial loop . to be explicit , for @xmath35",
    ", we can take a set of generators of the fundamental group @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the algebraic intersection number between two loops .",
    "then there is complete basis of harmonic 1-forms @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 , which implies @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "since the field @xmath16 only has the harmonic part , for @xmath43 , gauge transformations of gauge function commute with the small gauge transformations , and are called large gauge transformations .",
    "effectively they translate the variables @xmath44 by multiples of @xmath45 .",
    "they form the abelian group @xmath10 .",
    "substitute ( [ adecomp ] ) into ( [ chernsimons ] ) , the action reduces to according to the canonical quantization recipe , at this point , there is some freedom in choosing the canonical coordinate and momentum .",
    "we will use a real polarization here .",
    "namely , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are taken as the canonical variables , with the commutation relation @xmath48=\\frac{-\\i 2\\pi}{k}$ ] , and any other pairs commute .",
    "we shall require the quantum states to transform under lgts covariantly , and try to preserve classical properties of lgt as much as possible .",
    "generators of lgts can be written as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and they label different fourier modes of the wavefunction on the lattice . from the commutator of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "we can find they satisfy the relation this is called the clock algebra .",
    "when @xmath3 is not integer - valued , this is a deformed version of the classical commutation relation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it seems natural to interpret this deformation of algebra as a quantum effect .",
    "if one requires the quantum states to form a representation of the original undeformed classical algebra , then @xmath3 is quantized to be integer - valued .",
    "we will not make such requirement in this paper , and our results apply to the case of integer - valued @xmath3 straightforwardly .",
    "aside from carrying a representation of the above clock algebra , a quantum state also stores information that is invariant under lgt .",
    "the invariant subspace of the phase space is a @xmath55-dimensional torus , parameterized by generators of the holonomy group @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the non - trivial relation is another clock algebra these two clock algebras ( [ clockalgebra ] ) and ( [ dualclockalgebra ] ) can be regarded as being dual to each other , with duality transformation @xmath4 .",
    "note that these two sets of operators commute .",
    "for example , @xmath58 .",
    "thus they realize the statement that on the classical level holonomies are invariant under lgts .",
    "since both the lgt group and the holonomy group need to be represented in quantization , and there exists the above interesting duality transformation between them , we like to treat these two groups on an equal footing .",
    "this is another reason why @xmath3 is not restrained to be integer - valued .",
    "there is no obvious reason to insist that the holonomy group is undeformed , so by ( [ dualclockalgebra ] ) , @xmath59 does not need to integer - valued . to exploit the duality , it is better to allow non - integer - valued @xmath3 as well .    to quantize the theory , we shall look for representations of the algebras ( [ clockalgebra ] ) and ( [ dualclockalgebra ] ) , as well as of the mcg with appropriate induced action on ( [ clockalgebra ] ) and ( [ dualclockalgebra ] ) , and then the quantum states form the left modules of the representations . because the algebras ( [ clockalgebra ] ) and ( [ dualclockalgebra ] ) commute with each other , we can look for representations for them separately , and the complete representation is a tensor product .",
    "now we proceed to quantize the theory on a torus",
    ". we will need the following topological facts . for a torus , the fundamental group @xmath61 is abelian and generated by two loops @xmath62 , with @xmath63 .",
    "the mcg of the torus , @xmath64 is generated by a pair of dehn twists , @xmath65 , which can be presented in fig.[fgg1 ] as the loops @xmath66 .",
    "( in the following , we always pick mcg generators in such a way that they can be presented as simple loops , and for a loop @xmath67 , we denote the corresponding mcg generator by @xmath68 . ) to derive how they operate on loops , we take this convention : after performing a dehn twist , a loop turns left when it hits the representative loop of the dehn twist , and goes along the dehn twist loop , until it comes back to the turning point and continues its original path . with this convention ,",
    "the mcg generators act on the the fundamental group generators as    @xmath69    [ mcgg1classical ]    this group is actually @xmath70 , so the relations are    .",
    "the fundamental group generators are denoted by oriented loops with single thin lines , and labeled by greek letters ; the mcg generators are the unoriented loops with double lines , and labeled by roman letters.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    let us consider the representation of holonomy group first .",
    "this group is generated by @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 . in the representation where @xmath72 is diagonal , @xmath74 has the block - diagonal form : ( from here on , index of every series starts from 0 . )",
    "where each block forms irreducible representation and is determined by two parameters where @xmath75 , @xmath6 with @xmath76 coprime , and each block is @xmath77 dimensional .",
    "see appendix a for a proof that this is the most general irreducible representation of the clock algebra .",
    "note that we have not used up all the freedom of unitary transformation on these matrices .",
    "while keeping the above form , we can do a cyclic permutation of basis , which changes @xmath78 by a multiple of @xmath79 , and we can shift the phases of the set of basis , which changes @xmath80 by a multiple of @xmath79 . thus the phase parameters can be restricted as @xmath81 .",
    "then we need to find representation for the mcg generators , whose operation on the holonomies is derived from their classical operation ( [ mcgg1classical ] ) . the relations that @xmath82 should satisfy are to solve these equations , we decompose @xmath82 into @xmath83 blocks of @xmath77 elements as the holonomies .",
    "it turns out each block is given by where @xmath84 is a complex number , and components of @xmath77 matrix @xmath85 is given by the parameter @xmath86 , which does not depend on the block indices @xmath87 , is redundant , because it can be absorbed into @xmath84 .",
    "the reason for this redundancy will be clear later . in addition , ( [ ablock ] ) solves the equations ( [ aquantumeqn ] ) provided it is periodic with respect to the two indices .",
    "changing @xmath88 from @xmath89 to @xmath7 in @xmath90 gives the condition @xmath91=1 $ ] .",
    "this means if @xmath7 or @xmath8 is even , then @xmath92 are multiples of @xmath79 ; if @xmath76 are both odd , then @xmath92 are multiples of @xmath79 plus @xmath93 . on the other hand",
    ", we knew @xmath94 , so @xmath92 s are uniquely determined by @xmath3 , in other words , the representations must have the form @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is any unitary matrix .",
    "for @xmath97 , we need the solution is where by the same periodicity argument , we have so @xmath97 also have the form @xmath98 .",
    "since mcg of @xmath99 is @xmath100 , its generators @xmath65 should satisfy the relations @xmath101 . because of the redundant parameters @xmath86 and @xmath102 , we can require that the two parts of direct production satisfy the relations separately .",
    "so @xmath96 and @xmath103 are generators of an arbitrary unitary representation of the mcg . @xmath85 and @xmath104 are specified by some parameters , and we need to check how the relations constrain those parameters . for the first relation ,",
    "the right hand side is and the left hand side is comparing the two sides , we find a condition for @xmath105 the right hand side is a quadratic gauss sum , which is analytically expressed in term of some number - theoretical function .",
    "the exact expression will not be presented here .",
    "the important fact is , this equation is satisfiable for all possible @xmath7 and @xmath8 s ( @xmath76 odd , or @xmath7 even @xmath8 odd , or @xmath7 odd @xmath8 even ) .",
    "one can check that with the help of the term with @xmath106 , the two sides always have the same abstract values , and the phases can be matched by the yet - unknown @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for the second relation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 .",
    "so we get the another condition on @xmath105 the two conditions ( [ relationone ] ) and ( [ relationtwo ] ) will determine @xmath86 and @xmath102 up to 12 choices , but different choices are equivalent . actually , if @xmath86 and @xmath102 are a set of solution , then @xmath112 and @xmath113 also solve ( [ relationone ] ) and ( [ relationtwo ] ) .",
    "the difference between these two set of solutions is nothing but an abelian representation of the mcg , so it can be absorbed into @xmath96 and @xmath103 .    we still need to find representation for the dual clock algebra ( [ clockalgebra ] ) for lgts and representation for the action of mcg to the lgts .",
    "but these are exactly same algebras as those solved above , except @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath59 , or equivalently , @xmath76 are exchanged .",
    "thus irreducible unitary representation for the dual clock algebra is @xmath8-dimensional , phase parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 are uniquely determined to be @xmath116 , and counterparts of ( [ relationone ] ) and ( [ relationtwo ] ) give some solution to the phase parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the full representation for the algebras is    unlike ref.@xcite , value of @xmath3 is not restricted after imposing mcg .",
    "however , representing mcg still affect the representation of the holonomy group and the lgt group , because in this process , the phase parameters @xmath92 and @xmath119 are determined as in ( [ definitiondelta ] ) , which are otherwise free to change within @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are restricted similarly .",
    "the relevant topological properties of @xmath13 are the following .",
    "fundamental group of @xmath13 has 4 generators @xmath122 with one relation @xmath123 .",
    "the mcg of @xmath13 , @xmath124 , is generated by five dehn twists , @xmath125 , as are drawn in fig.[fgg2 ] .",
    "their operation on the loops are derived to be    @xmath126    and they satisfy the following relations @xcite    @xmath127=[\\a_1,\\b_2]=[\\b_1,\\a_2]=[\\b_1,\\b_2]=[\\b_1,\\s]=[\\b_2,\\s]=1,\\label{relation1}\\\\ & \\a_1\\b_1\\a_1=\\b_1\\a_1\\b_1,\\quad \\a_2\\b_2\\a_2=\\b_2\\a_2\\b_2,\\quad \\a_1\\s\\a_1=\\s\\a_1\\s,\\quad \\a_2\\s\\a_2=\\s\\a_2\\s,\\label{relation2}\\\\ & ( \\b_1\\a_1\\s)^4=\\b_2 ^ 2,\\label{relation3}\\\\ & [ \\b_2\\a_2\\s\\a_1\\b_1\\b_1\\a_1\\s\\a_2\\b_2,\\b_1]=1,\\label{relation4}\\\\ & ( \\b_2\\a_2\\s\\a_1\\b_1\\b_1\\a_1\\s\\a_2\\b_2)^2=1.\\label{relation5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .",
    "the fundamental group generators are denoted by oriented loops with single thin lines , and labeled by greek letters ; the mcg generators are the unoriented loops with double lines , and labeled by roman letters.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    by the convention of fig.[fgg2 ] , with @xmath128 , the chern - simons action is which results in the commutators and any other pair commutes .    like the previous example ,",
    "let us only consider representation of the holonomy group for now . from the above commutation relations , the holonomy group generators satisfy the clock algebra , and any other pair commutes .",
    "same as in the previous section , we have the following equations for the mcg generators , and they commute with the rest of the holonomy group generators .",
    "the equations we have listed so far are just two copies of their counterparts in section [ sec : g1 ] , so the solution of the generators is just a direct product of the solutions in section [ sec : g1 ] , where the new generator @xmath129 are determined by the equations and the solution is where this matrix is periodic only if one of @xmath76 are even , that is , @xmath130 .",
    "this is a non - trivial `` quantization condition '' for @xmath3 on @xmath13 .",
    "one can see that if we restrict @xmath3 to be integer - valued , then this condition agree with that in @xcite , which is @xmath3 must be an even integer .",
    "now we check the relations ( [ relation1])-([relation5 ] ) .",
    "( [ relation1 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "( [ relation2 ] ) gives the same equation as ( [ relationone ] ) except now @xmath130 , which means @xmath131 , and these two angles are related by this equation .",
    "so there is really only one free angle parameter left .",
    "consider the relation ( [ relation3 ] ) , so ( [ relation3 ] ) gives and this will fix all the angles up to 10 choices .",
    "next consider the relation ( [ relation4 ] ) , it can be checked now that this matrix commutes with @xmath132 .",
    "multiplying @xmath132 from left or from right just adds the factor @xmath133 or @xmath134 respectively , and they are the same because of the first delta function .",
    "so the relation ( [ relation4 ] ) poses no condition on the angles .",
    "the last relation ( [ relation5 ] ) is so given ( [ result1 ] ) and ( [ result2 ] ) , this condition is redundant .",
    "the nontrivial conditions are ( [ result1 ] ) and ( [ result2 ] ) , and they have @xmath135 distinct solutions , which are equivalent because the difference between the solutions are merely an abelian representation of mcg .    by repeating the above calculation with @xmath3 replaced by @xmath59 , we can get the representation for the dual algebra satisfied by lgt generators .",
    "in particular , the quantization condition for @xmath3 , which is one of @xmath76 must be even , is symmetric with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so the dual algebra will not give additional restriction on @xmath3 .",
    "fundamental group and mcg of @xmath35 with @xmath136 have the following presentation .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath137 is generated by @xmath55 loops @xmath138 , with one relation @xmath139 . for @xmath136 , mcg have @xmath140 generators , which are @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , as shown in fig.[fggg ] .",
    "an explicit presentation of mcg is given in @xcite .",
    "it takes the following form in our convention where and @xmath144 is computed from @xmath145 and the generators by induction where    .,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the holonomies are @xmath9 copies of quantum torus , and they satisfy clock algebra in pairs .",
    "representation of the @xmath140 mcg generators can also be derived from the their actions on the holonomies where in this process , we get the same quantization condition on @xmath3 , which is one of @xmath76 must be even .",
    "we still need to make sure the relations ( [ g3r1])-([g3r5 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "( [ g3r1 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "braid relations ( [ g3r2 ] ) give as before there leaves only one undetermined phase in the mcg generators .",
    "the 3-chain relation ( [ g3r3 ] ) is note that every element in this relation have the same form as in the previous section , so the results can be used . from ( [ relation4 ] ) , we know @xmath146=1 $ ] , by conjugation and commutation , this relation reduce to the previously proven relation ( [ relation3 ] ) , @xmath147 .",
    "about the lantern relation ( [ g3r4 ] ) after some calculation , we find so @xmath148 .",
    "this fix the remaining freedom in the mcg generators . to check the hyperelliptic relation ( [ g3r5 ] ) , by ( [ induction ] ) , we find @xmath149 takes the form of ( [ bn ] ) for all @xmath150 , and obviously this commutes with @xmath151 .    like in the previous section , representation of the dual clock algebra",
    "give no additional quantization condition on @xmath3 .",
    "to summarize the result , we find that the @xmath0 chern - simons theory defined on @xmath152 is quantizable , if we require the quantum states to form representations for the deformed holonomy group , the deformed lgt group , and the mcg .",
    "explicit , finite dimensional representation of these groups are found .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is quantized in an interesting manner . for @xmath12",
    ", @xmath3 can take any nonzero rational value , while for @xmath35 with @xmath153 , @xmath3 must be a rational number with either its numerator or denominator being even .",
    "the representations are unique in the sense that , apart from a choice of arbitrary unitary representation of mcg , the representations of the discrete groups ( holonomy group + lgt group + mcg ) are completely fixed .",
    "uniqueness of the representation of these discrete groups is an interesting result . in general ,",
    "when one considers gravity with some non - trivial space - time topology , it is expected that some theta angle parameters , or more complicated non - abelian parameters , will arise .",
    "but in our toy model , which can be regarded as three dimensional chern - simons gravity with gauge group @xmath0 instead of some non - abelian gauge group @xcite , although some theta angle parameters appear in representation of the clock algebra , they disappear after representing the mcg .",
    "the representations of the discrete groups on @xmath35 are found to be @xmath154 dimensional , where @xmath155 is the dimensionality of an arbitrary unitary representation of the mcg , and @xmath6 with @xmath76 coprime .",
    "this can be compared with the result of the path - integral quantization in ref.@xcite . if we take @xmath156 and @xmath3 integer - valued , it is easy to check that , the @xmath157 dimensional dimensional representation of the holonomy group from this work is exactly the same representation formed by states in the @xmath157 dimensional hilbert space found in ref.@xcite(see eqn .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) therein ) . as a consequence , the representations of mcg in this work and that in ref.@xcite are also the same .",
    "the @xmath154 dimensional hilbert space that we find can be viewed as a direct product of @xmath9 @xmath158-dimensional subspaces , and one @xmath155-dimensional subspace .",
    "each @xmath158-dimensional subspace is associated with one specific handle on @xmath35 , and the @xmath155-dimensional subspace forms an extra representation of the mcg . due to this decomposed structure",
    ", we can consider pinching of the handles , in which some handles are shrank to marked points .",
    "because the quantization condition on @xmath3 is stronger for @xmath153 than for @xmath159 , an allowed @xmath3 value on a higher genus surface will not pose any problem on a lower genus surface .",
    "without loss of generality , assume the first handle is pinched .",
    "the holonomy around the remaining marked points is @xmath160 , which is @xmath161 by eqn.([dualclockalgebra ] ) .",
    "this means in a quantum state , after the pinching , all information about holonomies of the first handle is lost . the same is true for information about lgts , with the same reason .",
    "thus the @xmath162-dimensional subspace becomes @xmath163 dimensional after pinching .",
    "for the @xmath155-dimensional subspace , the situation is more complicated . in general , representations of mcg of higher genus surface",
    "does not reduce to representations of mcg of lower genus surface with marked points , so if pinching is allowed , there may be some extra conditions on the @xmath155-dimensional representation of mcg .    as shown in previous sections , to impose the large gauge symmetry and large diffeomorphisms ,",
    "it is impossible to simply reduce the original classical phase space to some invariant subspace of these symmetries .",
    "however , it is straightforward , at least classically , to find the invariant phase space under one of the two symmetries .",
    "in fact , we chose to represent the large gauge symmetry first , and as a result the @xmath164-dimensional quantum plane , where @xmath165 is the first betti number , reduces to a @xmath164-dimensional torus times a @xmath166 lattice , both of which are deformed by the canonical commutator to non - commutative spaces .",
    "wave functions take values on these two parts of phase space separately",
    ". then the implementation of mcg gives some non - trivial and rather technical restrictions on the parameters of the theory , as were listed above .    in principle , the other way around , i.e. , to impose mcg first should be equally practicable .",
    "indeed , the invariant subspace is the moduli space of teichmller space of @xmath35 , and wave functions are sections based upon this moduli space .",
    "but it is not clear how the wave functions can carry a representation of the large gauge transformations .",
    "if @xmath167 and @xmath168 form a representation of the clock algebra , and @xmath167 is diagonal , their components satisfy so if @xmath169 is nonzero , @xmath170 . a general solution can be written as where @xmath171 is the size of each block , and @xmath172 is @xmath173 dimensional . but",
    "@xmath168 can be unitary only if @xmath174 . while fixing @xmath167 , the allowed unitary transformations have the form @xmath175 , and we can take all the @xmath176 s to be the same , but perform such unitary transformation @xmath7 times .",
    "one of the @xmath172 s can be diagonalized each time .",
