    "for example , the very same links , nodes and hubs that help create short - cuts in space for transport may become congested due to increased traffic yielding an increase in transit time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there are very few analytic results available concerning network congestion and optimal pathways in real - world networks @xcite .",
    "the physics community , in particular , hopes that a certain universality might exist among such networks . on the other hand",
    ", the biological community knows all too well that a wide diversity of structural forms can arise under very similar environmental conditions . in medicine",
    ", cancer tumors found growing in a given organ can have very different vascular networks . in plant biology ,",
    "branching networks of plant roots or aerial shoots from different species can co - exist in very similar environments , yet look remarkably different in terms of their structure .",
    "mycelial fungi @xcite provide a particularly good example , as can be seen in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) which show different species of fungi forming networks with varying degrees of lateral connections ( anastomoses ) .",
    "not only do fungi represent a wide class of anastomosing , predominantly planar , transport networks , but they have close parallels in other domains , including vascular networks , road and rail transport systems , river networks and manufacturing supply chains . but given that such biological systems could adapt their structures over time in order to optimize their functional properties , why do we observe such different structures as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) under essentially the same environmental conditions ?    in this paper ,",
    "we provide exact analytic results for the effects of congestion costs in networks with a combined ring - and - star topology @xcite .",
    "we thus address the question above by showing that quite different network structures can indeed share very similar values of the functional characteristics relevant to growth .",
    "we also show that small changes in the level of network congestion can induce abrupt changes in the optimal network structure .",
    "in addition to the theoretical interest of such phase - like structural transitions , our results suggest that a natural diversity of network structures should arise under essentially the same environmental conditions  as is indeed observed for systems such as fungi ( see figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "we then extend this analysis by introducing a novel renormalization scheme involving cost motifs , to describe analytically the average shortest path across multiple - ring - and - hub networks .",

    "@xcite appear similar to the present ones in terms of the wording of the conclusions , the context and structures considered are quite different  in addition , the results in the present paper are analytic and are obtained in a completely different way .    as a consequence of the present analysis , we uncover an interesting ` skin effect ' whereby the structure of the inner multi - ring core can cease to play any functional role in terms of determining the average shortest path across the network .",
    "the implication is that any food that is found on the perimeter of the network structure , can be transported across the structure _ without _ having to go through the central core  and as a result , the network structure in the central core may begin to die out because of a lack of nutrient .",
    "interestingly , there is experimental evidence that real fungal networks @xcite do indeed exhibit such a skin - effect",
    ". other real - world examples in which an inner network core ceases to be fed by nutrients being supplied from the perimeter , and hence dies out , include the vasculature inside the necrotic ( i.e. dead ) region in a growing cancer tumour , and the inner core of a growing coral reef .",
    "our analytically - solvable model system is inspired by the transport properties of real fungi ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) . a primary functional property of an organism such as a fungus , is to distribute nutrients efficiently around its network structure in order to survive .",
    "indeed , fungi need to transport food ( carbon ( c ) , nitrogen ( n ) and phosphorous ( p ) ) efficiently from a localized source encountered on their perimeter across the structure to other parts of the organism . in the absence of any transport congestion effects",
    ", the average shortest path would be through the center  however the fungus faces the possibility of ` food congestion ' in the central region since the mycelial tubes carrying the food do not have infinite capacity .",
    "hence the organism must somehow ` decide ' how many pathways to build to the center in order to ensure nutrients get passed across the structure in a reasonably short time . in other words , the fungus  either in real - time or as a result of evolutionary forces  chooses a particular connectivity to the central hub .",
    "but why should different fungi ( figs",
    ". 1(a ) and ( b ) ) choose such different solutions under essentially the same environmental conditions",
    "? which one corresponds to the optimal structure ? here",
    "we will show that , surprisingly , various structurally distinct fungi can each be functionally optimal at the same time .",
    "figure 1(d ) shows our model s ring - and - hub structure .",
    "although only mimicking the network geometry of naturally occurring fungi ( figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) ) , it is actually a very realistic model for current experiments in both fungal and slime - mold systems .",

    "1(e ) ) and slime - mold @xcite with the resulting network structures showing a wide range of distinct and complex morphologies @xcite .",
    "we use the term ` hub ' very generally , to describe a central portion of the network where many paths may pass but where significant transport delays might arise .",
    "such delays represent an effective cost for passing through the hub . in practice",
    ", this delay may be due to ( i ) direct congestion at some central junction , or ( ii ) transport through some central portion which itself has a network structure ( e.g. the inner ring of the houston road network in fig .",

    "we begin by introducing the dorogovtsev - mendes ( hereon dm ) model @xcite of a small world network .",
    "the dm - model consists of a ring - hub structure , and places @xmath0 nodes around a ring , each connected to their nearest neighbour with a link of unit length .",
    "links around the ring can either be directed in the `` directed '' model or undirected in the `` undirected '' model . with a probability @xmath1 each node",
    "is connected to the central hub by a link of length @xmath2 , and these links are undirected in both models .",
    "we may proceed to solve this model , as in @xcite , by first finding the probability @xmath3 that the shortest path between any two nodes on the ring is @xmath4 , given that they are separated around the ring by length @xmath5 .",

    "summing over all @xmath5 for a given @xmath4 and dividing by @xmath6 yields the probability @xmath7 that the shortest path between two randomly selected nodes is of length @xmath4 .",
    "the average value for the shortest path across the network is then @xmath8 . for the undirected model ,",
    "the expressions are more cumbersome due to the additional possible paths with equal length . however",
    ", if we define @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , a simple relationship may be found between the undirected and directed models in the limit @xmath12 with @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 . thus the `` directed '' and",
    "`` undirected '' models only differ in this limit by a factor of two : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 now running from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we generalize the dm model of section [ subsec : dm ] to include a cost , @xmath19 , for passing through the central hub@xcite .",

    "@xmath77 , both the high and low connectivity structures are optimal . hence there are two structurally inequivalent networks having identical ( and optimal ) functional properties .",

    "we have checked that similar structural transitions can arise for higher - order nonlinear cost - functions .",
    "in particular we demonstrate here the extreme case of a ` step ' function , where the cost is fixed until the connectivity to the central hub portion reaches a particular threshold value . as an illustration",
    ", we consider the particular case : @xmath87 where @xmath88 depending on whether @xmath89 is negative , zero , or positive respectively , and @xmath90 determines the frequency of the jump in the cost .",

    "5 ( bottom ) ) as @xmath25 and @xmath90 are varied .",
    "a multitude of structurally - distinct yet optimal network configurations emerge .",
    "as @xmath90 decreases , the step - size in the cost - function decreases and the cost - function itself begins to take on a linear form  accordingly , the behavior of @xmath36 tends towards that of a linear cost model with a single identifiable minimum .",
    "most importantly , we can see that once again a gradual change in the cost parameter leads to an abrupt change in the structure of the optimal ( i.e. minimum @xmath36 ) network .",

    "bottom : the ` step ' cost - function as a function of the step - frequency parameter @xmath90 and @xmath25 . as @xmath90 decreases , the cost - function becomes increasingly linear . ]",
    "we have allowed our ring - and - hub networks to seek optimality by modifying their radial connectivity while maintaining a single ring . relaxing this constraint to allow for transitions to multiple - ring structures yields a number of related findings .",
    "in particular , allowing both the radial connectivity and the number of rings to change yields abrupt transitions between optimal networks with different radial connectivities _ and _ different numbers of rings .",
    "one could , for example , consider this to be a model of a complicated fungal structure ( figs .",
    "1(b ) , 1(e ) ) or of the interactions between hierarchies within an organization , such as in fig . 6 .        to analyze analytically such multiple - ring structures we introduce the following renormalization scheme .",
    "consider the two - ring - and - hub network in fig .",
    "1(f ) . for paths which pass near the center",
    ", there is a contribution to the path - length resulting from the fact that the inner ring has a network structure which needs to be traversed .",
    "hence the inner - ring - plus - hub portion acts as a _ renormalized hub _ for the outer ring . in short , the ring - plus - hub of eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be treated as a ` cost motif ' for solving multiple - ring - and - hub problems , by allowing us to write a recurrence relation which relates the average shortest path in a network with @xmath91 rings to that for @xmath92 rings : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath19 being a general cost for the inner - most hub .",

    "( 1 ) . as before",
    ", @xmath97 represents the probability of a link between rings @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath98 is the number of nodes in ring @xmath91 .",
    "we investigate the properties of our renormalized @xmath99-ring network by placing a number of constraints on the parameters and observing the average shortest path behaviour , so we may once again determine regimes of functionally optimal network configurations .",
    "we begin by increasing the number of rings to @xmath100 , with the constraint that the number of nodes on each ring is fixed .",
    "we find that the configuration that yields the minimum average shortest path length has all the ring probabilities , @xmath101 , equal .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates the average shortest path distribution for such a case .",
    "figure 7 also demonstrates the accuracy of our analytic renormalized result , as compared to a full - scale numerical calculation for @xmath36 .",
    "if we allow the number of nodes on the two rings to be different , we find that the configuration that optimizes the shortest path favours a larger number of connections on the ring with the most nodes . returning to the original configuration , @xmath100 with an equivalent number of nodes on each ring , we consider the effect of a cost on the central hub of the inside ring .",
    "we find that a greater number of connections on the ring without costs optimizes the network , as one might expect .",
    "the addition of further rings , such that @xmath102 , leads to some interesting results . for a network with an equivalent number of nodes on each ring",
    "the optimal configuration remains such that all the ring probabilities , @xmath101 , are equal .",
    "however , for @xmath103 , we begin to see a deviation : connections should be moved to the outer rings of the network ( those furthest away from the hub ) in increasing numbers out to the edge of the network to obtain the minimum shortest path .",
    "we thus consider the properties of a network with varying @xmath99 ; equal ring probabilities @xmath101 ; inner ring costs , @xmath104 , that vary from @xmath105 ; both fixed numbers of nodes on each ring , @xmath106 constant , and varying numbers of nodes on each ring such that @xmath107 .",
    "figure 8 shows the average shortest path distribution for several such cases .",
    "interestingly , for large @xmath99 the system becomes indifferent to the cost of the central hub , @xmath104 , and all the distributions converge , in both the case of fixed and varying numbers of nodes on each individual ring .",
    "this is suggestive of an effective ` skin effect ' , as the center of the network becomes effectively disconnected after the addition of a large number of rings .",
    "the redundance of the central portion of the network offers an explanation for an earlier finding : that as we approach @xmath103 the optimal configuration ceases to be such that all innermost ring probabilities , @xmath101 , are equal .",
    "we find that to optimize the network we need to move the connections into the skin , more than likely as a result of the detachment of the center of the network from the whole .    by comparison of the shortest path values of our multiple ring networks",
    ", we have found a further important result .",
    "we find that there are optimal network structures with different numbers of rings and radial connectivities , yet which have the _ same _ average shortest path length across them @xcite .",
    "hence , as before , optimal network structures exist which are structurally very different , yet functionally equivalent .",
    "figure 9 shows an explicit example of two such functionally equivalent , optimal networks .",
    "it is remarkable that these images are so similar to the real fungi shown in figs .",

    "in summary , we have analyzed the interplay between the structure and function within a class of biologically - motivated networks , and have uncovered a novel structural phase transition .",
    "depending on the system of interest ( e.g. fungus , or road networks ) these transitions between inequivalent structures might be explored in real - time by adaptive re - wiring , or over successive generations through evolutionary forces or ` experience ' . through the use of an approximation",
    ", we treated the original network as a cost - motif for a larger network and considered the circumstances under which such networks obtained their optimal functional structure .",
    "the equivalence in function , defined by the networks transport properties , between various topologically distinct structures may provide insight into the existence of such disparate structure in real fungi .",
