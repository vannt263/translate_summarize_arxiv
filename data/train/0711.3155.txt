    "in mathematics and physics , the scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles . the scattering matrix for the one - dimensional dirac operator @xmath2 is closely related to the transition probability of particles through a potential .",
    "however , if the potential does not vanish at infinity , a klein paradox might occur .",
    "the latter is of great historical importance in order to justify the existence of the antiparticle of an electron ( the positron ) and explaining qualitatively the pair creation process in the collision of particle beam with strongly repulsive electric field .",
    "the explanation of this klein paradox usually resorted to the concept of `` hole '' in the `` negative - energy electron sea '' . for more physical interpretations we refer to klein @xcite , sauter @xcite , bjorken - drell @xcite , sakurai @xcite , thaller @xcite and calogeracos - dombey @xcite for the history of the klein paradox .",
    "this paradox appears also for the klein - gordon equation , here no concept of `` hole '' is needed ( see winter @xcite and ni - zhou - yan @xcite for a constant potential at infinity and bachelot @xcite for an electrostatic potential having different asymptotics at infinity ) .",
    "the comparison between the klein paradox for this two equations has been discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part c ) .",
    "a klein paradox phenomenon occurs also in quantum field theory ( see hund @xcite and manogue @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that this paradox can not appear for schrdinger operators .    for a scalar potential having real limits",
    "@xmath3 at @xmath4 , the klein paradox of the dirac equation occurs if @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the higher part of @xmath6 intersects its lower part . if the energy @xmath7 is in this intersection , for a wave - packet which comes from the left and moves towards the potential , a part of it",
    "is reflected , another part being transmitted .",
    "the transmitted part moves to the right and behaves like a solution with negative energy .",
    "ruijsenaars - bongaarts @xcite ( see also thaller @xcite ) have mathematically treated the klein paradox and the scattering theory for the dirac equation with one - dimensional potentials constant outside a compact set .",
    "they have established the connection between time - dependent and time - independent scattering theory in terms of incoming and outgoing plane wave solutions .",
    "the exact calculus of the scattering matrix for one - dimensional dirac operator is only known for a few number of explicit potentials ( see klein @xcite for a rectangular step potential and flgge @xcite for the potential @xmath8 ) . nevertheless , we are neither aware of works dealing with the asymptotic expansion of the scattering matrix , with respect to the semi - classical parameter @xmath1 .    for one - dimensional schrdinger operators ,",
    "there are several approaches which have been developed dealing with the computation of the transmission coefficient through a barrier .",
    "ecalle @xcite and voros @xcite have developed the so - called complex wkb analysis which gives approximations in the complex plane of the solutions of a schrdinger equation .",
    "this approach is used in a new formalism by grigis for the hill s equation @xcite .",
    "this method is also used by c. grard - grigis @xcite to calculate the eigenvalues near a potential barrier and by ramond @xcite for scattering problems . for references and a historical discussion",
    ", we refer to ramond @xcite .",
    "the complex wkb method has been extended to a class of schrdinger systems by fujii - lasser - ndelec @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an asymptotic expansion , with respect to the semi - classical parameter @xmath1 , of the coefficients of the scattering matrix for the one - dimensional dirac operator with potentials having different limits at infinity .",
    "we establish the exponential decay of the transmission coefficient in the klein paradox case ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm2point ] below ) .",
    "we calculate the coefficients of the scattering matrix in terms of incoming and outgoing solutions .",
    "therefore , we use the complex wkb analysis to construct solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "the usefulness of this analysis is that it provides , rather than approximate solutions with error bounds , solutions in the complex plane with a complete asymptotic expansion with respect to the semi - classical parameter @xmath1 , with a priory estimates on the coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the perturbed dirac operator on @xmath0 , study the time - independent scattering theory and state our main results . in section [ sectionconst ] , we develop the complex wkb method and show a complete asymptotic expansion of the coefficients . in section [ sectionjost ] , the existence of incoming and outgoing jost solutions is proved . in section [ sect-2ptourn ] , we analyze the semi - classical behavior of the scattering matrix in the klein paradox case .",
    "the total transmission over a potential barrier and the total reflection are studied in section [ sec-0ptourn ] and section [ sec-1ptourn ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - mass0 ] , we study the klein paradox for the zero mass case .",
    "we consider the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the semi - classical dirac operator on @xmath0 : @xmath11 with domain @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the semi - classical parameter , @xmath14 is the mass of the dirac particle and@xmath15 is the celerity of the light .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 are the @xmath17 pauli matrices satisfying the anti - commutation relation @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath17 identity matrix .",
