    "if hybrid mesons or glueballs are ever to be identified as states that are distinct from conventional @xmath0   with the same @xmath1 , or from the hadronic continuum , some gift of nature may be required . to illustrate what we mean , and to motivate the subsequent discussion ,",
    "recall that the underlying valence @xmath0   structure to the light flavored mesons was historically identified because nature left some multiplets relatively clean .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 multiplets are to good approximation flavor eigenstates , the i=0 members being almost pure @xmath4 and @xmath5   respectively . had this not been the case , it is probable that the quark model for mesons would have been delayed until the subsequent discovery of another gift , namely the occurrence of heavy flavors and associated charmonium or bottomonium spectroscopies .",
    "glueballs and hybrids are expected to decay into channels that are also accessed by the decays of conventional mesons .",
    "even when the gluonic hadrons have exotic @xmath1 , they can couple to pairs of mesons sharing these quantum numbers .",
    "in general therefore one may expect that diagrams involving meson loops will cause mixing between gluonic hadrons and conventional @xmath0 .",
    "one of the questions that we shall study here is if there are circumstances where hybrid states , in particular , may decouple from conventional @xmath0   with the same @xmath1 .",

    ", the correlations of mass and flavor throughout a nonet can distinguish between a hybrid nonet and a tetraquark or di - meson system : the former has the canonical degenerate i = 0 ( isospin singlet ) and i=1 ( isospin triplet ) low - lying with a single i=0 ( @xmath5 ) above the strange members ( as in the conventional @xmath2 ) , whereas the latter has an inverted structure with the degenerate i=0 and i=1 heaviest , above the strange and a low - lying isolated i=0 state , as seen for the scalar mesons below 1 gev@xcite .",

    "discussion of the latter has a long history , as summarised for example in refs .",
    "we shall assess the implications of these works for the flavor mixing in hybrid nonets .",

    "the theorems assumed that the creation of @xmath0  , which triggered the ozi - allowed decay , is in spin - triplet@xcite ; we show the theorem holds for either spin - triplet or spin - singlet .",

    "the mixing between conventional @xmath0   of a given flavor in states with the same @xmath1 but different @xmath38 and @xmath24 was analysed in ref .",
    "we now apply such ideas to the mixing between a conventional @xmath0   and a hybrid meson of the same @xmath1 for the traditional case of @xmath68 pair creation . summing over a semi - complete set of degenerate intermediate states , mixing between hybrids and conventional mesons only occurs if they have the same @xmath38 , @xmath24 and @xmath69 . however , such coincidences are not theoretically anticipated , at least for low - lying hybrids . for example , in the lattice ( e.g. ref .",

    "if this is indeed a major player in realising the ozi rule , then one would not anticipate this cancellation to occur for these exotic hybrids because the spatial matrix element to @xmath79 $ ] is expected to vanish . in this case , there could be significant violation of the ozi rule , and flavor mixing in these exotic hybrids .      when heavy flavors ( @xmath97 ) are involved , inter - flavor mixing is qualitatively different . consider the case of @xmath12 mixing into the @xmath13 and @xmath98 into the @xmath21 .",
    "this could occur via intermediate loops involving @xmath99 ( @xmath100 being forbidden by parity ) .",
    "however , generically @xmath101 can occur by the factorising ozi creation of @xmath0 , whereas @xmath0   @xmath102 requires the creation of @xmath12 . in the latter , where @xmath103 , the ozi process would require the color fields of force to extend over excessive distances without having created light @xmath0 .",
    "this is highly improbable and the ozi process is suppressed both theoretically and empirically@xcite . a way for such decays to be triggered is if the required energy to create @xmath12 is supplied by a hard process such as single gluon exchange .    the @xmath0   @xmath104 leaves the light flavors in color - octet . for flavor mixing in a color - singlet meson",
    ", this will require the subsequent annihilation of the @xmath0   to mirror the former : @xmath105 .",
    "hence the mixing amplitude , through an intermediate loop of charmed mesons , will necessarily be of @xmath106 and in accord with pqcd .",
    "we see that even for light flavors the loop mixing is in effect @xmath106 for the @xmath89 case . in the limit where the intermediate vector and pseudoscalar mesons have equal mass ( @xmath107 ) , eq .",
    "[ pseudoverlap ] shows the ozi loop amplitude vanishes .",
    "a non - zero overlap follows if @xmath108 . in practice",
    "this is the case and arises due to the chromomagnetic interaction arising from one gluon exchange ( oge)@xcite . phenomenologically therefore , the non - zero mixing from ozi - generated loops is proportional to @xmath106 , manifested by the vector - pseudoscalar mass splittings .",
    "the mixings involving heavy flavors in spin - triplet , such as @xmath109 , are required to involve perturbative gluons for analogous reasons to the @xmath89 case . however",
    ", charge conjugation plays a non - trivial role .",
    "the initial state @xmath0   has charge conjugation @xmath110 .",
    "the initial step @xmath0   @xmath104 converts the @xmath0   into @xmath111 and creates the @xmath12 with @xmath110 .",
    "while the latter requires only color rearrangement to map onto the @xmath110 @xmath12 final state , the subsequent annihilation of @xmath0   requires two gluons to satisfy charge conjugation , hence three gluons overall .",
    "consequently for heavy flavors in general , meson loops are dual to pqcd expectations .",
    "in the limit where all mesons in a loop belong to a degenerate subset , we have extended an existing theorem of ref .",
    "first , we have shown that that theorem is not restricted to @xmath0   creation in @xmath68 but also applies for @xmath94 . the previous result that @xmath10 or @xmath11 states of given flavors remain orthogonal",
    "is found to apply also to hybrid mesons such that mixing of a hybrid vector with either @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xmath0   vanishes in these circumstances .",
    "hence within these assumptions , hybrid vector @xmath0   mesons will decouple from their conventional @xmath0   counterparts .",
    "we have extended the discussion to the case of loop - induced mixing between different flavors . for the case of heavy quarkonium the mixing with light @xmath0   through loops containing heavy - flavored mesons ( for example @xmath12   mixing with @xmath0   via charmed mesons ) is dominated by pqcd ( gluon exchange ) .",

    "@xmath113 gluons @xmath114 @xmath0 . for light flavors ,",
    "by contrast , there is no connection between meson loops and pqcd , except perhaps insofar as degeneracy can be broken by oge .",
    "one of the motivations of this work was to examine the circumstances under which hybrid mesons would decouple from or be distinguishable from conventional @xmath0   and other exotics .",
    "we have shown that the vector hybrids decouple from the vector @xmath0   states ; there is however also the question of flavor mixing .",
    "if for some @xmath1 a hybrid nonet were flavor ideal , this would enable a clear distinction from di - meson correlations with the same @xmath1 .",
    "the former would exhibit the familiar flavor triangle as in the @xmath115 $ ] as against the inverted structure for a tetraquark / di - meson nonet , e.g. as in the low - lying scalars @xmath116 - \\kappa - \\sigma$ ] . to decide , a priori , which extreme is more likely requires understanding the origin of flavor mixing and the ozi rule for conventional @xmath0 .    for light flavors where @xmath0   are in @xmath94",
    ", the multiplets would be ideal within the approximations used here .",
    "however , these theorems can not immediately be applied to the ground - state @xmath89 even within a naive picture where they are @xmath0   states .",
    "first of all , the loops contain the mesons themselves .",
    "therefore , to be consistent some iterative procedure , such as that suggested in @xcite , would need to be used and converge .",
    "second , the assumption of mass degeneracy within a subset is empirically severely violated .",
    "for the initial @xmath0   in @xmath68 we demonstrated that coupling to loops gives a destructive interference that is 67% in amplitude ; this quantifies a qualitative historical observation of lipkin@xcite . in the case of initial @xmath0   with internal @xmath117 , namely @xmath2",
    ", there is further destructive interference in the spatial overlaps of meson loops containing @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] ( in the @xmath73 $ ] notation of section [ sec : loops ] ) .",
    "the absolute cancellations are model dependent , as discussed by geiger and isgur@xcite .",
    "hence there is a qualitative understanding of the ozi rule for the @xmath2 nonet , but any quantitative description depends on the details of strong interactions , and is currently beyond lattice qcd .",
    "this qualitative picture suggests that the flavor mixing for hybrid multiplets may be quite different from conventional @xmath0 . for a hybrid vector with its @xmath0   coupled to @xmath94 the multiplet should be ideal , at least in @xmath68 @xmath0   pair - creation dynamics .",
    "exotic @xmath1 , such as @xmath118 , have the @xmath0   coupled to @xmath68 . while the flavor - spin suppression arises here , thereby giving a tendency towards an ideal ozi nonet as before , the spatial interferences are non - trivial . in a particular limit ,",
    "discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , it is predicted that the spatial amplitudes for hybrid decays to @xmath79 $ ] vanish .",
    "however , the amplitude to @xmath77 $ ] is allowed and predicted to be the dominant decay channel .",
    "this implies that the pattern of spatial suppressions found for @xmath119 does not arise here .    in summary , the flavor - spin coupling favors ideal mixing for the @xmath118 hybrid nonet but of itself is not sufficient to expect a situation as ideal as that found for the conventional @xmath2 nonet .",
    "the ideal situation observed for the conventional @xmath2 appears also to require spatial interferences , which are not anticipated to arise for the @xmath118 hybrid if our current understanding of hybrid meson decays is any guide .",
    "in such a case , where decays to @xmath77 $ ] dominate , this will make it hard to distinguish a hybrid @xmath0   nonet from di - meson enhancements , though the decoupling from @xmath79 $ ] can give a characteristic signature .",
