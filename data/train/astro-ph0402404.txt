    "one of the most fascinating enigma in modern astrophysics concerns the true nature of the ultra - dense compact objects called _ neutron stars _ ( ns ) .",
    "the bulk properties and the internal structure of these stars chiefly depends upon the equation of state ( eos ) of dense hadronic matter .",
    "different models for the eos of dense matter predict a neutron star maximum mass ( @xmath0 ) in the range of 1.4  2.2 @xmath1 , and a corresponding central density in range of 4  8 times the saturation density ( @xmath2g/@xmath3 ) of nuclear matter ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; haensel 2003 ) . in the case of a star with @xmath4 ,",
    "different eos models predict a radius in the range of 7  16 km ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; haensel 2003 ; dey et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in a simplistic and conservative picture",
    "the core of a neutron star is modeled as a uniform fluid of neutron rich nuclear matter in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ( @xmath5-stable nuclear matter ) .",
    "however , due to the large value of the stellar central density and to the rapid increase of the nucleon chemical potentials with density , hyperons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 particles ) are expected to appear in the inner core of the star .",
    "exotic _ phases of hadronic matter such as a bose - einstein condensate of negative pion ( @xmath12 ) or negative kaon ( @xmath13 ) could be present in the inner part of the star .    according to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase should occur at a density of a few times nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "consequently , the core of the more massive neutron stars is one of the best candidates in the universe where such deconfined phase of quark matter ( qm ) could be found .",
    "this possibility was realized by several researchers soon after the introduction of quarks as the fundamentals building blocks of hadrons ( ivanenko & kurdgelaidze 1969 ; itoh 1970 ; iachello et al .",
    "1974 ; collins & perry 1975 ; baym & chin 1976 ; keister & kisslinger 1976 ) .",
    "since @xmath5-stable hadronic matter posses two conserved `` charges '' ( _ i.e. , _ electric charge and baryon number ) the quark - deconfinement phase transition proceeds through a mixed phase over a finite range of pressures and densities according to the gibbs criterion for phase equilibrium ( glendenning 1992 ; mller & serot 1995 ) . at the onset of the mixed phase ,",
    "quark matter droplets form a coulomb lattice embedded in a sea of hadrons and in a roughly uniform sea of electrons and muons . as the pressure increases various geometrical shapes ( rods , plates ) of the less abundant phase immersed in the dominant one",
    "are expected .",
    "finally the system turns into uniform quark matter at the highest pressure of the mixed phase ( heiselberg et al .",
    "1993 ; voskresensky et al .",
    "compact stars which possess a `` quark matter core '' either as a mixed phase of deconfined quarks and hadrons or as a pure quark matter phase are called _ hybrid neutron stars _ or shortly _ hybrid stars _ ( hys ) ( glendenning 1996 ; drago & lavagno 2001 ) . in the following of this paper",
    ", the more _ conventional _ neutron stars in which no fraction of quark matter is present , will be referred to as _ pure hadronic stars _ ( hs ) .",
    "even more intriguing than the existence of a quark core in a neutron star , is the possible existence of a new family of compact stars consisting completely of a deconfined mixture of _ up _ ( _ u _ ) , _ down _ ( _ d _ ) and _ strange _ ( _ s _ ) quarks ( together with an appropriate number of electrons to guarantee electrical neutrality ) satisfying the bodmer",
    " witten hypothesis ( bodmer 1971 ; witten 1984 ; see also terazawa 1979 ) .",
    "such compact stars have been called _ strange quark stars _ or shortly _ strange stars _ ( ss ) ( alcock et al . 1986 ; haensel et al .",
    "1986 ) and their constituent matter as _ strange quark matter _ ( sqm ) ( farhi & jaffe 1984 ; madsen 1999 ) .",
    "presently there is no unambiguous proof about the existence of strange stars , however , a sizable amount of observational data collected by the new generations of x - ray satellites , is providing a growing body of evidence for their possible existence ( bombaci 1997 ; cheng et al .",
    "1998 ; li et al .",
    "1999a ; li et al .",
    "1999b ; xu 2002 ; drake et al .",
    "it is generally believed that the unambiguous identification of a strange star will imply that all pulsars must be strange stars . in the present work",
    "we argue that the possible existence of strange stars does not conflict with the existence of _ conventional _ neutron stars ( pure hadronic stars ) .",
    "present accurate determinations of compact star masses in radio pulsar binaries ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) permit to rule out only _ extremely soft _ eos , _",
    "i.e. _ those giving @xmath0 less than about 1.45  @xmath1 .",
    "however , in at least two accreting x - ray binaries it has been found evidence for compact stars with higher masses .",
    "the first of these star is vela x-1 , with a reported mass @xmath14 ( quaintrell et al .",
    "2003 ) , the second is cygnus x-2 , with a reported mass of @xmath15 ( orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , mass determinations in x - ray binaries are affected by large uncertainties ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1995 ) , therefore the previous quoted `` high mass values '' should always be handled with care .",
    "in addition to mass determination , existing observational data on the spin frequency of millisecond pulsars and on the thermal evolution of neutron stars do not put severe constraints on the eos of dense matter .",
    "fortunately , this situation is improving in the last few years .",
    "in fact , the extraordinary spectroscopic capabilities of the instruments on board chandra x - ray and xmm - newton satellites , are giving the unique possibility to perform accurate measurements of the gravitational red - shift in the spectral lines of a few compact x - ray sources .",
    "this provide informations on the mass to radius ratio for compact stars and will help us to understand the true nature of these compact objects .",
    "in this work we study the effects of the hadron - quark deconfinement phase transition in stellar compact objects .",
    "we show that when finite size effects at the interface between the quark- and the hadron - phase are taken into account , pure hadronic stars , above a threshold value of the central pressure ( gravitational mass ) , are metastable to the _ decay _ ( _ conversion _ ) to hybrid neutron stars or to strange stars ( depending on the properties of eos for quark matter ) .",
    "the _ mean - life time _ of the metastable stellar configuration is related to the quantum nucleation time to form a drop of quark matter in the stellar center , and dramatically depends on the value of the stellar central pressure .",
    "we explore the consequences of the metastability of `` massive '' pure hadronic stars and the existence of stable compact quark stars ( hybrid neutron stars or strange stars ) on the concept of limiting mass of compact stars .",
    "next , we discuss the implications of our scenario in the interpretation of the mass - radius constraints extracted from the spectra of several x - ray compact sources . finally , we discuss the implications of our scenario for gamma ray bursts .",
    "nucleation of quark matter in neutron stars has been studied by many authors .",
    "most of the earlier studies on this subject ( horvath et al . 1992 ; horvath 1994 ; olesen & madsen 1994 ; heiselberg 1995 ; grassi 1998 ) have been restricted to the case of thermal nucleation in hot and dense hadronic matter . in these studies , it was found that the prompt formation of a critical size drop of quark matter via thermal activation is possible above a temperature of about 2  3 mev . as a consequence",
    ", it was inferred that pure hadronic stars are converted to strange stars or to hybrid stars within the first seconds after their birth .",
    "it was also suggested that the large amount of energy liberated in this process could play a crucial role in type - ii supernova explosions ( benvenuto & horvath 1989 ) .",
    "all the studies on quark matter nucleation mentioned above , have neglected an important physical aspect which charecterizes dense matter in a newly born _ neutron star _ : the trapping of neutrinos in the stellar core .",
    "neutrino trapping has a sizeable influence on the _ stiffness _ of the eos and , consequently , on the structural properties of the protoneutron star ( bombaci 1996 ; prakash et al .",
    "in particular , it has been found that neutrino trapping significantly shifts the critical baryon density for the quark deconfinement phase transition to higher values with respect to the neutrino - free case ( prakash et al .",
    "1997 ; lugones & benvenuto 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , neutrino trapping decreases the value of the central density of the stellar maximum mass configuration with respect to the neutrino - free case ( prakash et al .",
    "thus , the formation of a metastable supercompressed phase of hadronic matter is strongly inhibited in a protoneutron star .",
    "a detailed study of quark matter nucleation in hot and dense hadronic matter with trapped neutrinos will be presented in a forthcoming work ( bombaci et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we assume that the compact star survives the early stages of its evolution as a pure hadronic star , and we study quark matter nucleation in cold ( t = 0 ) neutrino - free hadronic matter . in bulk matter",
    "the quark - hadron mixed phase begins at the _",
    "static transition point _ defined according to the gibbs criterion for phase equilibrium @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the chemical potentials for the hadron and quark phase respectively , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denote respectively the total ( _ i.e. , _ including leptonic contributions ) energy density , the total pressure and baryon number density for the hadron ( quark ) phase , in the case of cold matter .",
    "let us now consider the more realistic situation in which one takes into account the energy cost due to finite size effects in creating a drop of deconfined quark matter in the hadronic environment . as a consequence of these effects ,",
    "the formation of a critical - size drop of qm is not immediate and it is necessary to have an overpressure @xmath24 with respect to the static the transition point .",
    "thus , above @xmath25 , hadronic matter is in a metastable state , and the formation of a real drop of quark matter occurs via a quantum nucleation mechanism .",
    "a sub - critical ( virtual ) droplet of deconfined quark matter moves back and forth in the potential energy well separating the two matter phases ( see discussion below ) on a time scale @xmath26 seconds , which is set by the strong interactions .",
    "this time scale is many orders of magnitude shorter than the typical time scale for the weak interactions , therefore quark flavor must be conserved during the deconfinement transition",
    ". we will refer to this form of deconfined matter , in which the flavor content is equal to that of the @xmath5-stable hadronic system at the same pressure , as the q*-phase . soon afterwards a critical size drop of quark matter is formed the weak interactions will have enough time to act , changing the quark flavor fraction of the deconfined droplet to lower its energy , and a droplet of @xmath5-stable sqm is formed ( hereafter the q - phase ) .",
    "for example , if quark deconfinement occurs in @xmath5-stable nuclear matter ( non - strange hadronic matter ) , it will produce a two - flavor ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) quark matter droplet having @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the _ up _ and _ down _ quark number densities respectively , and @xmath32 the proton fraction in the @xmath5-stable hadronic phase .",
    "in the more general case in which the hadronic phase has a strangeness content ( _ e.g. , _ hyperonic matter ) , the deconfinement transition will form a droplet of strange matter with a flavor content equal to that of the @xmath5-stable hadronic system at the same pressure , according to the relation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the concentrations of the different particle species .    in the present work ,",
    "we have adopted rather common models for describing both the hadronic and the quark phase of dense matter .",
    "for the hadronic phase we used models which are based on a relativistic lagrangian of hadrons interacting via the exchange of sigma , rho and omega mesons .",
    "the parameters adopted are the standard ones ( glendenning & moszkowski 1991 ) .",
    "hereafter we refer to this model as the gm equation of state ( eos ) . for the quark phase",
    "we have adopted a phenomenological eos ( farhi & jaffe 1984 ) which is based on the mit bag model for hadrons .",
    "the parameters here are : the mass @xmath35 of the strange quark , the so - called pressure of the vacuum @xmath36 ( bag constant ) and the qcd structure constant @xmath37 . for all the quark matter model used in the present work , we take @xmath38 , @xmath39  mev and @xmath40 .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "thus the number density of each phase adjust adiabatically to the fluctuations of the droplet radius , and the system retains pressure equilibrium between the two phases .",

    "if the nucleation time @xmath98 associated to the maximum mass configuration for the hadronic star sequence is of the same order or much larger than the age of the universe @xmath114 , then m_lim = m_hs , max , in other words , the limiting mass in this case coincides with the oppenheimer  volkoff maximum mass for the hadronic star sequence .",
    "( _ b _ ) if the critical mass @xmath80 is smaller than @xmath83 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath115  yr ) , thus the limiting mass for compact stars is equal to the largest value between the critical mass for the hs and the maximum mass for the quark star ( hys or ss ) sequence m_lim = max .",
    "( _ c _ ) finally , one must consider an `` intermediate '' situation for which @xmath116 . as the reader can easely realize , now m_lim = max , depending on the details of the eos which could give @xmath117 or vice versa .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , we show the limiting mass @xmath113 calculated in the case of the gm1+bag model ( dashed line ) and in the case of the gm3+bag model ( continuous line ) as a function of the bag constant @xmath36 . in the same figure , we compare our theoretical determination for @xmath113 with some of the `` measured '' masses of compact stars in radio pulsar binaries ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) and for the compact stars vela x-1 ( quaintrell et al .",
    "2003 ) and cygnus x-2 ( orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "an accurate measure of the radius and the mass of an individual `` neutron star '' will represent the key to open the _ safety deposit _ which contains the secrets of the internal constitution of these puzzling astrophysical bodies and to discriminate between different models for the equation of state of dense hadronic matter .",
    "unfortunately such a crucial information is still not available .",
    "a decisive step in such a direction has been done thanks to the instruments on board of the last generation of x - ray satellites .",
    "these are providing a large amount of fresh and accurate observational data , which are giving us the possibility to extract very tight constraints on the radius and the mass for some compact stars .",
    "the analysis of different astrophysical phenomena associated with compact x - ray sources , seems to indicate in some case the existence of neutron stars with `` large '' radii in the range of 12  20 km and in some other cases the existence of compact stars with `` small '' radii in the range of 6  9 km ( bombaci 1997 ; li et al .",
    "1999a ; poutanen & gierlinski 2003 ; bombaci 2003 ) .",
    "clearly , this possibility is a natural outcome of our scenario , where two different families of compact stars , the pure hadronic stars and the quark stars ( hys or ss ) , may exist in the universe .    in the following of this section",
    ", we will consider some of the most recent constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio for compact stars extracted from the observational data for a few x - ray sources , and we will try make an interpretation of these results within our scenario .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , we report the radius an the mass of the compact star rx j1856.5 - 3754 inferred by walter & lattimer ( 2002 ) ( see also kaplan et al .",
    "2002 ) from the fit of the full spectral energy distribution for this isolated radio - quite `` neutron star '' , after a revised parallax determination ( kaplan et al .",
    "2002 ) which implies a distance to the source of @xmath118  pc . comparing the mass - radius box for 18 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] with the theoretical determination of the mr relation for different equations of state , one concludes that 18 could be ( see _ e.g. _ fig . 2 in walter & lattimer , 2002 ) either an hadronic star or an hybrid or strange star",
    "( see also drake et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "next we consider the compact star in the low mass x - ray binary 4u  1728 - 34 . in a very recent paper shaposhnikov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( hereafter sth ) have analyzed a set of 26 type - i x - ray bursts for this source .",
    "the data were collected by the proportional counter array on board of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite . for the interpretation of these observational",
    "data shaposhnikov et al .",
    "2003 used a model of the x - ray burst spectral formation developed by titarchuk ( 1994 ) and shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2002 . within this model ,",
    "sth were able to extract very stringent constrain on the radius and the mass of the compact star in this bursting source .",
    "the radius and mass for 4u  1728 - 34 , extracted by sth for different best - fits of the burst data , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] by the filled squares .",
    "each of the four mr points is relative to a different value of the distance to the source ( d = 4.0 , 4.25 , 4.50 , 4.75 kpc , for the fit which produces the smallest values of the mass , up to the one which gives the largest mass ) .",
    "the error bars on each point represent the error contour for 90% confidence level .",
    "it has been pointed out ( bombaci 2003 ) that the semi - empirical mr relation for the compact star in 4u  1728 - 34 obtained by sth is not compatible with models pure hadronic stars , while it is consistent with strange stars or hybrid stars .    assuming 18 to be a pure hadronic star and 4u  1728 - 34 an hybrid or a strange star , we see from our results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , that this possibility can be realized as a natural consequence of our scenario . thus , we find that the existence of quark stars ( with `` small '' radii ) does not exclude the possible existence of pure hadronic stars ( with `` large '' radii ) , and _",
    "vice versa_.    decisive informations on the mass - to - radius ratio can be provided by measuring the gravitational redshift of lines in the spectrum emitted from the compact star atmosphere .",
    "very recently , redshifted spectral lines features have been reported for two different x - ray sources ( cottam et al .",
    "2002 ; sanwal et al .",
    "the first of these sources is the compact star in the low mass x - ray binary 07 . studing the spectra of 28 type - i x - ray bursts in 07 , cottam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have found absorption spectral line features , which they identify as signatures of fe  xxvi ( 25-time ionized hydrogen - like fe ) and fe  xxv from the @xmath119 atomic transition , and of o  viii ( @xmath120 transition ) .",
    "all of these lines are redshifted , with a unique value of the redshift @xmath121 .",
    "interpreting the measured redshift as due to the strong gravitational field at the surface of the compact star ( thus neglecting general relativistic effects due to stellar rotation on the spectral lines ( ezel & psaltis 2003 ) ) , one obtains a relation for the stellar mass - to - radius ratio : m / m_= ( 1 - 1 ) r / r_g , ( @xmath122  km ) which is reported in fig.s  [ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] as a dashed line labeled @xmath121 . comparing with the theoretical mr relations for differente eos ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , , and also xu 2003 ) it is clear that all three possible families of compact stars discussed in the present paper are completely consistent with a redshitf @xmath123 .",
    "the second source for which it has been claimed the detection of redshifted spectral lines is 1e  1207.4 - 5209 , a radio - quite compact star located in the center of the supernova remnant psk  1209 - 51/52 .",
    "1e  1207.4 - 5209 has been observed by the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "two absorption features have been detected in the source spectrum and have been interpreted ( sanwal et al .",
    "2002 ) as spectral lines associated with atomic transitions of once - ionized helium in the atmosphere of a strong magnetized ( @xmath124  g ) compact star .",
    "this interpretation gives for the gravitational redshift at the star surface @xmath125 0.12  0.23 ( sanwal et al . 2002 ) , which is reported in fig.s  [ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] by the two dashed lines labeled @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "a different interpretation of similar data , collected by the xmm - newton satellite , has been recently given by bignami et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who interpreted the absorption features in the spectrum of e12 as electron cyclotron lines in the stellar magnetic field . within this interpretation and assuming the gravitational redshift of a `` canonical neutron star '' with @xmath128 and @xmath129  km bignami et al .",
    "( 2003 ) derived a magnetic field strength @xmath130  g for the compact star in e12 .",
    "the two values of the stellar magnetic field inferred in the above quoted papers ( sanwal et al .",
    "2002 ; bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) are in disagreement to each other and in disagreement with the @xmath36 field deduced from the e12 timing parameters ( @xmath54 and @xmath131 ) , which give @xmath132 ( 2  3 ) @xmath133  g within the rotating magnetic dipole model .",
    "however , the latter value of the magnetic field strenght presents serious problems since the current values of the timing parameters implies a characteristic pulsar age @xmath134  yr ( bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) which is not compatible with the age @xmath135@xmath136  yr ( roger et al . 1988 ) .",
    "clearly this source needs a more accurate study before any final and unambiguous interpretations of the observed spectral features can be drawn . here",
    ", we will assume that the interpretation of the spectral feature given by sanwal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and by cottam et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is correct . in that case ,",
    "how it is possible to reconcile the gravitational redshift @xmath1250120.23 for 1e  1207.4 - 5209 with that ( @xmath137 ) deduced for exo 0748 - 676 ? within the commonly accepted view , in which there exist in nature only one family of compact stars ( the `` neutron stars '' ) , different values of the gravitational redshift could be a consequence of a different mass of the two stars . in our scenario , we can give a different interepretation : 1e  1207.4 - 5209 is a pure hadronic star whereas exo 0748 - 676 is an hybrid star or a strange star .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.s  [ fig : fig6 ] and [ fig : fig7 ] by comparing our calculated mr relations with the redshifts deduced for the two compact x - ray sources .",
    "a large variety of observational data are giving a mounting evidence that `` long - duration '' gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with supernova explosions ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ; amati et al . 2000 ; antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ; piro et al .",
    "2000 , reeves et al .",
    "2002 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; price et al . 2003 ; stanek et al . 2003 ; lipkin et al .",
    "2003 ) . particularly , in the case of the gamma ray burst of july 5 , 1999 ( grb990705 ) , in the case of grb020813 and of grb011211",
    ", it has been possible to estimate the time delay between the two events .    for grb990705 amati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) evaluated that the supernova explosion ( sne ) has occurred about 10 years before the grb , while lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , giving a different interpretation of the same observational data , deduced a time delay of about one year . in the case of grb020813 the supernova event has been estimated ( butler et al . 2003 ) to have occurred a few months before the grb , while in the case of grb011211 about four days before the burst ( reeves et al .",
    "if a time - delay between a sne and the associated grb will be confirmed by further and more accurate observations , thus it is necessary to have a two - step process .",
    "the first of these process is the supernova explosion which forms a compact stellar remnant , _",
    "i.e. _ a neutron star .",
    "the second catastrophic event is associated with the neutron star and it is the energy source for the observed grb . these new observational data , and the two - step scenario outlined above , poses severe problems for most of the current theoretical models for the central energy source ( the so called `` central engine '' ) of grbs .    in a recent paper berezhiani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have given a simple and natural interpretation of the `` delayed '' supernova - grb connection in terms of the stellar conversion model ( hereafter the _ quark deconfinement nova _ ( qdn ) ) discussed in the present work . here , with respect to the work of berezhiani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we have considered two different parameterizations ( gm1 and gm3 ) for the eos of the hadronic phase , and we have explored a larger range for the bag constant in the eos for the quark phase .",
    "moreover , in the present paper the nucleation time has been calculated by considering the quantum tunneling of a virtual drop of quark matter in the so called q*-phase ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , contrary to the work of berezhiani et al . ( 2003 ) where quark flavor conservation during the deconfinement transition has been neglected .",
    "we have verified that flavor conservation in computing the nucleation time produces sizable differences in the value of the critical mass @xmath80 and on the energy released during the qdn which powers the grb .",
    "as we can see from the results reported in tab.s 1 and 2 , the total energy ( @xmath138 ) liberated during the stellar conversion process is in the range 0.51.7@xmath139  erg .",
    "this huge amount of energy will be mainly carried out by the neutrinos produced during the stellar conversion process .",
    "it has been pointed out by salmonson & wilson ( 1999 ) that near the surface of a compact stellar object , due to general relativity effects , the efficiency of the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation into @xmath140 pairs is strongly enhanced with respect to the newtonian case , and it could be as high as 10@xmath141 . the total energy deposited into the electron - photon plasma can therefore be of the order of @xmath142@xmath143 erg .",
    "the strong magnetic field of the compact star will affect the motion of the electrons and positrons , and in turn could generate an anisotropic @xmath144-ray emission along the stellar magnetic axis .",
    "this picture is strongly supported by the analysis of the early optical afterglow for grb990123 and grb021211 ( zhang et al . 2003 ) , and by the recent discovery of an ultra - relativistic outflow from a `` neutron star '' in a binary stellar system ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ) . moreover , it has been recently shown ( lugones et al .",
    "2002 ) that the stellar magnetic field could influence the velocity of the `` burning front '' of hadronic matter into quark matter .",
    "this results in a strong geometrical asymmetry of the forming quark matter core along the direction of the stellar magnetic axis , thus providing a suitable mechanism to produce a collimated grb ( lugones et al . 2002 ) .",
    "other anisotropies in the grb could be generated by the rotation of the star .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the consequences of the hadron - quark deconfinement phase transition in stellar compact objects when finite size effects between the deconfined quark phase and the hadronic phase are taken into account .",
    "we have found that above a threshold value of the gravitational mass a pure hadronic star is metastable to the decay ( conversion ) to a hybrid neutron star or to a strange star .",
    "we have calculated the _",
    "mean - life time _ of these metastable stellar configurations , the critical mass for the hadronic star sequence , and have explored how these quantities depend on the details of the eos for dense matter .",
    "we have introduced an extension of the concept of limiting mass of compact stars , with respect to the classical one given by oppenheimer & volkov ( 1939 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that , within the astrophysical scenario proposed in the present work , the existence of compact stars with `` small '' radii ( quark stars ) does not exclude the existence of compact stars with `` large '' radii ( pure hadronic stars ) , and _",
    "vice versa_.    finally , we have shown that our scenario implies , as a natural consequence a two step - process which is able to explain the inferred `` delayed '' connection between supernova explosions and grbs , giving also the correct energy to power grbs .",
    "there are various specific features and predictions of the present model , which we briefly mention in the following .",
    "the second explosion ( _ quark deconfinement nova _ ) take place in a `` baryon - clean '' enviroment due to the previous sn explosion .",
    "is is possible to have different time delays between the two events since the _ mean - life time _ of the metastable hadronic star depends on the value of the stellar central pressure .",
    "thus the present model is able to interpret a time delay of a few years ( as observed in grb990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2001 ) ) , of a few months ( as in the case of grb020813 ( butler et al . 2003 ) ) , of a few days ( as deduced for grb011211 ( reeves et al . 2002 ) ) , or the nearly simultaneity of the two events ( as in the case of sn2003dh and grb030329 ( hjorth et al . 2003 ) ) .                                                                                                                                                & & & & +   + & & & & & & & & & & +   + 208.24 & 1.769 & 2.002 & 1.798 & 2.040 & & 1.805 & 2.050 & + 169.61 & 1.633 & 1.828 & 1.754 & 1.983 & & 1.778 & 2.014 & + 136.63 & 1.415 & 1.561 & 1.668 & 1.871 & & 1.719 & 1.937 & + 108.70 & 1.426 & 1.604 & 1.510 & 1.673 & & 1.615 & 1.804 & + 106.17 & 1.433 & 1.617 & 1.490 & 1.649 & & 1.602 & 1.788 & + 103.68 & 1.441 & 1.632 & 1.469 & 1.623 & 1.434 & 62.5 & 1.588 & 1.770 & + 101.23 & 1.449 & 1.648 & 1.447 & 1.596 & 1.411 & 64.0 & 1.574 & 1.752 & + 98.83 & 1.459 & 1.665 & 1.425 & 1.569 & 1.388 & 66.0 & 1.559 & 1.734 & + 96.47 & 1.470 & 1.684 & 1.402 & 1.541 & 1.364 & 68.5 & 1.543 & 1.715 & + 94.15 & 1.481 & 1.704 & 1.378 & 1.513 & 1.339 & 71.1 & 1.527 & 1.694 & 1.474 & 94.8 + 91.87 & 1.494 & 1.726 & 1.354 & 1.484 & 1.313 & 74.2 & 1.511 & 1.674 & 1.456 & 98.1 + 89.64 & 1.507 & 1.750 & 1.329 & 1.453 & 1.285 & 77.3 & 1.495 & 1.654 & 1.438 & 101.8 + 87.45 & 1.552 & 1.776 & 1.302 & 1.422 & 1.257 & 80.7 & 1.477 & 1.632 & 1.417 & 105.9 + 85.29 & 1.538 & 1.803 & 1.275 & 1.389 & 1.228 & 84.4 & 1.458 & 1.610 & 1.397 & 110.4 + 80.09 & 1.581 & 1.879 & 1.196 & 1.296 & 1.144 & 92.9 & 1.410 & 1.551 & 1.342 & 122.7 + 75.12 & 1.631 & 1.966 & 1.082 & 1.164 & 1.029 & 93.78 & 1.359 & 1.489 & 1.284 & 133.1 + 65.89 & 1.734 & 2.156 & 0.820 & 0.867 & 0.764 & 100.6 & 1.212 & 1.315 & 1.123 & 159.9 + 63.12 & 1.770 & 2.222 & 0.727 & 0.764 & 0.672 & 98.1 & 1.160 & 1.254 & 1.067 & 166.5 + 59.95 & 1.814 & 2.305 & 0.545 & 0.566 & 0.501 & 79.7 & 1.081 & 1.162 & 0.986 & 168.8 +   +        & & & & +   + & & & & & & & & & & +   + 136.63 & 1.448 & 1.613 & - & - & & 1.551 & 1.734 & + 122.07 & 1.430 & 1.600 & - & - & & 1.539 & 1.718 & + 108.70 & 1.440 & 1.627 & 1.484 & 1.648 & & 1.498 & 1.665 & + 106.17 & 1.445 & 1.637 & 1.474 & 1.635 & 1.444 & 53.4 & 1.487 & 1.651 & + 103.68 & 1.451 & 1.648 & 1.461 & 1.619 & 1.430 & 56.2 & 1.475 & 1.636 & 1.442 & 57.9 + 101.23 & 1.458 & 1.661 & 1.449 & 1.603 & 1.415 & 59.3 & 1.462 & 1.620 & 1.428 & 60.9 + 98.83 & 1.466 & 1.676 & 1.435 & 1.587 & 1.400 & 62.5 & 1.449 & 1.604 & 1.413 & 64.3 + 96.47 & 1.475 & 1.692 & 1.421 & 1.569 & 1.384 & 66.3 & 1.436 & 1.587 & 1.398 & 68.0 + 94.15 & 1.485 & 1.710 & 1.406 & 1.550 & 1.367 & 70.0 & 1.422 & 1.570 & 1.382 & 71.9 + 91.87 & 1.497 & 1.731 & 1.390 & 1.531 & 1.348 & 74.2 & 1.407 & 1.552 & 1.365 & 76.2 + 89.64 & 1.509 & 1.753 & 1.373 & 1.510 & 1.329 & 78.5 & 1.392 & 1.534 & 1.347 & 80.8 + 87.45 & 1.523 & 1.778 & 1.355 & 1.488 & 1.308 & 83.1 & 1.376 & 1.515 & 1.329 & 85.7 + 85.29 & 1.538 & 1.804 & 1.335 & 1.463 & 1.285 & 87.8 & 1.360 & 1.495 & 1.310 & 90.6 + 80.09 & 1.582 & 1.881 & 1.270 & 1.385 & 1.214 & 98.7 & 1.314 & 1.438 & 1.255 & 104.0 + 75.12 & 1.631 & 1.966 & 1.181 & 1.280 & 1.121 & 107.8 & 1.252 & 1.365 & 1.187 & 116.85 + 65.89 & 1.734 & 2.155 & 0.943 & 1.005 & 0.877 & 117.8 & 1.126 & 1.216 & 1.045 & 144.5 + 63.12 & 1.770 & 2.222 & 0.808 & 0.854 & 0.747 & 110.2 & 1.082 & 1.164 & 0.997 & 152.1 + 59.95 & 1.814 & 2.305 & 0.513 & 0.531 & 0.471 & 74.7 & 1.010 & 1.081 &",
