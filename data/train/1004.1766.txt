    "as one knows , the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei depends sensitively on the density dependence of the symmetry energy . the sensitive probe to differences in the symmetry energy",
    "may thus possibly exist in systems that undergo a relative variation of the proton and neutron matter distributions .",
    "this relative variation can follow from the collective excitation or deexcitation between the ground state and superdeformed secondary minimum ( ssm ) in heavy nuclei with appreciable neutron excesses . especially , the large relative variation can be expected for nuclei in the mass region @xmath1 where the prolate superdeformation of the secondary minima usually occurs with the oblate ground states  @xcite . in deed , quite different deexcitation energies of the ssm for nuclei in the region @xmath1 were predicted by various models that usually diversify the symmetry energies , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . since in obtaining the deexcitation energy the isoscalar ingredients of the ground state and ssm cancel",
    "largely , the variation of the deexcitation energy can be mainly attributed to the uncertainty of the symmetry energy that is controlled by the isovector potential . however , a direct relationship between the deexcitation energy and the density dependence of the symmetry energy is not available in the literature . in this work ,",
    "it is thus meaningful to establish this relationship .",
    "it is the aim of this work to constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model through deexcitation energies measured and to be measured for nuclei in the region @xmath1 .",

    "apart from these dynamical resonances , the ssm features a static structure .",

    "we note that the bcs description for nucleon pairing is not as popular as the bogoliubov approach , e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "however , in this work we do not pursue a complete description of nucleon pairings but investigate the relative change in binding energies of the ground state and ssm with respect to the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "for both ground states and ssm , the numbers of oscillator shells @xmath30 are used in the basis expansion .",
    "the solution of the coupled dirac and meson equations can be obtained in an iterative procedure that can be easily found in the literature  @xcite , and it is not reiterated here .",
    "in this work , we make analyses based on the calculations with the rmf parameter set nl3 *  @xcite that is an improved version of the parameter set nl3  @xcite . also , the isoscalar - isovector coupling is included to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "this new parameter set has been successfully tested by the properties of the ground states and collective excitations of fintie nuclei .",
    "based on this parameter set , here we investigate the deexcitation energies relative to the ground states for hg and au isotopes , while attention will be paid to the sensitivity of the deexcitation energy to differences in the symmetry energy .",

    "the first term is the potential part of the symmetry energy , and the second term is the kinetic part .",
    "the modification to the symmetry energy is dictated by the potential part through the isoscalar - isovector coupling .",
    "since the symmetry energy is not well constrained at saturation density , some average of the symmetry energy at saturation density and the surface energy is needed according to the constraint from the binding energy of nuclei . for a given @xmath37",
    ", we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to readjust the @xmath38 coupling constant @xmath39 so as to keep the symmetry energy unchanged at @xmath40 @xmath41 . in doing so",
    ", the symmetry energy is softened by the isoscalar - isovector coupling , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsym ] . as a result",
    ", it was found that the neutron skin thickness relies sensitively on the @xmath37 , while the total binding energy of @xmath0pb just changes by a few mev with the @xmath37 of interest  @xcite .",
    "the small change in the total binding energy results from two cancellation mechanisms .",
    "the first mechanism is inherent in the rmf theory due to the cancellation between the big scalar attraction provided by the @xmath15 meson and the big vector repulsion provided by the @xmath12 meson  @xcite .",
    "though the isoscalar - isovector coupling modifies predominantly the isovector potential , its influence can be passed on to the isoscalar potential through modified nucleon matter distributions . here , the @xmath15 field energy changes with respect to @xmath37 coherently with the @xmath12 field energy but with an opposite sign .",
    "the second mechanism can be understood according to the virial theorem , which can be written in the non - relativistic form as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the nuclear potential .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsym ] , the symmetry energy is modified oppositely below and above the fixed point ( @xmath40@xmath41 ) , and this is ensured by the similar modification to the isovector potential . due to the strong coupling between protons and neutrons , modifications in the isoscalar potential are similar , albeit small . according to the virial theorem , the modification to the nucleon kinetic energy is associated with the gradient of the potential .",
    "the opposite modifications to the potential give rise to opposite increments for the gradient of the potential .",
    "thus , the cancellation between opposite increments leads to just a small change to the nucleon kinetic energy .",
    "eventually , the change in the total binding energy is small with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "nevertheless , since the empirical binding energies of finite nuclei were firstly reproduced quite accurately by the best - fit models , the variation of the total binding energy , albeit small , can not simply be used to constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",

    ", we are thus interested in the deexcitation energy of the ssm relative to the ground state . however , since the isoscalar - isovector coupling modifies not only the isovector potential but also the isoscalar potential , an efficient probe to the density dependence of the symmetry energy should be able to separate clearly the modification to the isovector potential from that to the isoscalar potential . in the following ,",
    "it is necessary to exhibit such a separation in obtaining the deexcitation energy . in order to analyze the potentials obtained with the deformed rmf code conveniently in one dimension",
    ", it is necessary to perform the multipole expansion as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spherical harmonic function .",
    "the deexcitation energy , which is the energy difference between the secondary minimum ( s.m . ) and the ground state ( g.s . ) , is associated with the corresponding difference of the potentials @xmath46 where the superscript @xmath47 represents the isoscalar ( is ) or isovector ( iv ) . here ,",
    "the isoscalar and isovector potentials are given as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "[ fpot ] , only the two most important components @xmath52 and @xmath53 that are respectively responsible for the spherical matter distribution and quadrupole deformation are drawn , while the difference between the higher - l components of the potentials is becoming clearly smaller and much less sensitive to the @xmath37 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fpot ] that the difference of the isoscalar potential is almost independent of the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference of the isovector potential varies significantly with the @xmath37 in the surface region .",
    "especially , a large variation against the @xmath37 is seen for the isovector potential difference @xmath54 , associated with the large oblate - prolate shape difference between the ground state and ssm in @xmath50hg and @xmath55hg .",
    "these naturally exhibit a clear separation of the relative variation of the isovector potentials from that of the isoscalar potentials .",
    "in particular , the relative variation of isoscalar portions of the two states with respect to the @xmath37 nearly cancels out .    since the isoscalar - isovector coupling modifies just slightly the nucleon potentials , it can be treated as a small residue interaction .",
    "this rules out the occurrence of large coherent changes in nuclear potentials of the ground and metastable states while with slight relative changes between various states , and thus the small change in total binding energies can be determined by that of nuclear potentials with rather stable nuclear structures .",
    "consequently , the shift of the deexcitation energy caused by the isoscalar - isovector coupling can be obtained from the small relative change in nuclear potentials between the ground state and ssm . due to the nearly exact cancellation between the variations of isoscalar potentials in the ssm and ground state , the variation of the deexcitation energy results predominantly from the modification to the isovector potential caused by the isoscalar - isovector coupling .",
    "besides from the potential part , the kinetic energy and the nonlinear term of the isoscalar - isovector coupling also directly cause the variation of the deexcitation energy , but they can after all be determined from the nuclear potential , for instance , according to eqs.([eqmeson ] ) and ( [ eqviri ] ) .",

    "energies are in unit of mev and radii in unit of fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we clarify the concern whether the variation of deexcitation energies can be disguised by the much larger change in the ground - state energy , which is about 7 mev for the @xmath37 of interest , as estimated in table  [ tab1 ] . to do this , we just need to observe the variation of the deexcitation energy in the case of the constant ground - state energy .",
    "it is possible to reduce or even eliminate the variation of the ground - state binding energy by suitably choosing the fixed point which can affect the extent of cancellations , whereas this is numerically complicated . alternatively",
    ", the elimination of the variation in the ground - state energy can actually be fulfilled by slightly readjusting the meson - nucleon coupling constants or meson masses . without priority , here we realize it by slightly readjusting the @xmath15 meson mass @xmath60 .",
    "the recalculated results are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab3 ] , the variation of the total ground - state binding energy is nearly eliminated by just modifying the @xmath60 up to 0.07 mev . with this slight readjustment of the @xmath60 ,",
    "the modification to the incompressibility is just about 0.8 mev .",
    "noticeably , the variation of deexcitation energies is almost unchanged , as compared with that given in table  [ tab2 ] . definitely , the sensitivity of deexcitation energies to differences in the symmetry energy is irrelevant to the variation of the ground - state energy .",
    "the underlying physics for this is attributed to the fact that the variation of the deexcitation energy is conditioned predominantly on the modification to the isovector potential that changes the density dependence of the symmetry energy , as analyzed for results shown in fig .",
    "[ fpot ] .",
    "on the other hand , the difference between deexcitation energies of @xmath55hg and @xmath50hg is still large ( about 1.5 mev ) , as compared to the experimental value 0.7 mev , and is not reduced by including the isoscalar - isovector coupling .",
    "it means that the accurate deexcitation energies for @xmath50hg and @xmath55hg both can not be obtained with the same @xmath37 .",
    "it is seen in table  [ tab2 ] that the difference between the deexcitation energies for @xmath55hg and @xmath50hg is not sensitive to the @xmath37 .",
    "this is because the isospin asymmetries @xmath34 in @xmath55hg and @xmath50hg are not very different .",
    "consequently , the considerable reduction of the difference between the deexcitation energies for @xmath55hg and @xmath50hg should resort to the alteration of the isoscalar potential . for instance",
    ", this difference is reduced to be 0.5 mev with the rmf parameter set tm1  @xcite whose isoscalar potential is moderately different from that with the nl3 * due to the inclusion of the @xmath12-meson self - interaction . however , with the @xmath12-meson self - interaction , the softened vector potential leads to small deexcitation energies and much shallower potential wells of the ssm . as deexcitation energies for @xmath50hg and @xmath55hg are both much smaller than the data within the tm1 , the isoscalar - isovector coupling can be included to partly compensate this discrepancy , whereas an overall compensation seems yet to be available in the model that features the @xmath12-meson self - interaction .    ) of the ssm for odd - odd au isotopes versus the neutron skin thickness in @xmath0pb with the nl3*. the results are obtained by varying the @xmath37 properly with @xmath39 . the mass number is marked for each curve .",
    "[ figau],width=377,height=377 ]    further , we notice that the deexcitation energy is nearly of the same magnitude as the pairing energy .",
    "the correct deexcitation energy of some nuclei may be obtained with the inclusion of the isospin - dependent pairing interactions .",
    "for instance , using different pairing gaps and strengths in ref .",
    "@xcite , the deexcitation energy of @xmath55hg with the nl3 was reproduced in nice agreement with the experimental value . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference of the deexcitation energies between @xmath50hg and @xmath55hg was still 0.8 mev larger than the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "if this prescription is applied to resolve the discrepancy of the deexcitation energy with the experiments for other isotopes , it will impose stringent constraints on pairing strengths . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetry energy in finite nuclei can successfully be extracted regardless of the pairing interaction  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the observable response to the symmetry energy would be rather independent of the pairing interaction .",
    "specifically , we find that the deexcitation energies of the ssm in odd - odd nuclei in the region @xmath1 just depend very weakly on the pairing interaction , while the sensitive dependence on the isoscalar - isovector coupling does not alter at all .",
    "the former is because the pairing interaction in odd - odd nuclei is substantially suppressed by the pauli blocking and the nucleonic current that breaks the double degeneracy . if the pairing interaction turns off while reviving the nucleonic current and the contribution of the @xmath61 meson in these odd - odd nuclei  @xcite , the deexcitation energy is just changed by about 0.2 mev .",
    "therefore , no appreciable effect on deexcitation energies can be observed by modifying pairing strengths in these odd - odd nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ figau ] , we display as examples the deexcitation energies for a few odd - odd au isotopes as a function of the neutron skin thickness for @xmath0pb .",
    "since the neutron skin thickness in @xmath0pb depends almost linearly on the @xmath62  @xcite , the sensitive dependence on the @xmath62 can be observed for deexcitation energies of odd - odd au isotopes .",
    "we can thus expect that the measurement of the deexcitation energy of these odd - odd isotopes can be useful not only for constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy but also clarifying this theoretical uncertainty .",
    "next , let us discuss more the factors that are necessary for the description of the deexcitation energy .",
    "first of all , since the ssm is a result of the collective excitation that undergoes a significant isovector change , the appropriate isovector potential of the model is necessary .",
    "we find from table  [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] that the description for deexcitation energies of various isotopes is improved by including the isoscalar - isovector coupling .",
    "in other words , the inclusion of the isoscalar - isovector coupling improves the isovector potential of the model .",
    "secondly , we note that the isoscalar potential is also an important ingredient to carry out correct deexcitation energies . especially , the difference between the deexcitation energies for the neighboring even - even isotopes is tightly associated with the appropriate fit to the isoscalar potential .",
    "the present study indicates that an overall description for the deexcitation energies and difference between them needs to reconstruct the model appropriately with the isovector potential that brings out a softened symmetry energy .    at last",
    ", we should stress that though the present work is performed based on a specific parametrization ( nl3 * ) , the conclusion that the deexcitation energy is sensitive to differences in the symmetry energy is rather free of this specific rmf model .",
    "we have examined this with many other rmf models .",
    "the current situation is that most best - fit models have been constructed regardless of the detail of the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "thus , the agreement with data of deexcitation energies may play a significant role in reconstructing models with the appropriate density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "moreover , we have noted that the treatment of the nucleon pairing with the bcs theory is comparatively simple as compared with the bogoliubov approach .",
    "this would affect the accuracy of the correlation between deexcitation energies of even nuclei and the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "one can expect the improvement with the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov models .",
    "however , this is beyond the capacity and scope of this preliminary effort .",
    "in summary , we have studied the relationship between the deexcitation energies of the ssm in heavy nuclei and the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "the investigation is based on the rmf model ( nl3 * ) with the isoscalar - isovector coupling included to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "it is found that the uncertainty of the deexcitation energy originates almost uniquely from the modification to the isovector potential induced by the isoscalar - isovector coupling .",
    "the deexcitation energies can thus serve as a theoretical probe to the density dependence of the symmetry energy . as a result",
    ", we find that the theoretical estimates of the deexcitation energies of hg isotopes can be improved by the inclusion of the isoscalar - isovector coupling that softens the symmetry energy .",
    "to separate the effect of the symmetry energy on deexcitation energies from that of pairing correlations , we propose to measure the deexcitation energies of odd - odd heavy nuclei in the region @xmath1 such as au isotopes that are nearly independent of pairing correlations .",
