    "powerful extended radio galaxies are beacons that can be observed to very high redshift .",
    "a special and select subset of radio sources are studied here : very powerful classical double radio sources with cigar - like bridge shapes .",
    "@xcite determined that sources of this type are among the most powerful frii radio sources , and that these sources have quite regular radio bridge structure indicating that each side of each source is growing at a rate that is well into the supersonic regime and has negligible backflow .",
    "it follows that the equations governing strong shocks may be applied to these systems .",
    "strong shock physics is clean and simple , and makes these sources ideal candidates for detailed study and analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , only powerful extended radio sources with 178 mhz radio powers greater than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are included in this study , and only radio galaxies are included so as to minimize projection effects , which are likely to be much more important for radio loud quasars .",
    "the sample includes 11 radio galaxies with bright bridge emission presented by @xcite , six sources presented by @xcite , and fourteen sources observed by @xcite and @xcite , which were also studied by @xcite , for a total of 31 sources . a standard cosmological model with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is used throughout .",
    "the work presented here is described in greater detail by @xcite .",
    "a spectral aging analysis was carried out on eleven radio galaxies presented by @xcite , and combined with information obtained previously for twenty radio galaxies .",
    "the velocities are shown in figure 1 as a function of core - hotspot separation .",
    "two points are obtained for each source ; one from each side of the source .",
    "the strong shock equation relating the ambient gas density @xmath5 to the bridge pressure @xmath6 and the rate of growth of the source @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , and that relating the beam power @xmath9 to these parameters and the bridge width @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) were used to obtain the ambient gas density at the end of each side of each source and the beam power being channeled to each side of each source .",
    "the source widths and pressures used to derive the ambient gas densities and beam powers are presented by @xcite .    the composite profile of the ambient gas density is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the estimated ambient gas density is quite sensitive to offsets from minimum energy conditions , as discussed , for example , by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the values shown here for the velocity , ambient gas density , beam power , total source lifetime , and total source energy are obtained assuming the magnetic field strength is one quarter of the minimum energy value .",
    "this is the value suggested by requiring agreement between the ambient gas density indicated by x - ray measurements and ram pressure confinement of the forward region of the radio source @xcite .",
    "the ambient gas density falls with distance from the radio core as expected if the sources are close to the center of clusters or protoclusters of galaxies .",
    "the beam power is plotted as a function of core - hotspot separation in figure 3 , which indicates that the beam power of each source is likely to be roughly constant over the lifetime of the source .",
    "interestingly , the beam power obtained here ( @xmath12 ) has a very weak dependence on any offsets of the magnetic field strength from minimum energy conditions due to a cancellation between the way the magnetic field enters @xmath7 and @xmath6 , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "thus , our determination of @xmath9 is essentially independent of whether the system is close to or quite far from minimum energy conditions .",
    "a comparison of the properties of each source with those of the parent population at similar redshift allow a power - law relationship to be derived between the beam power of a given source and the total lifetime of the outflow that powers the large - scale radio emission , as discussed in detail by @xcite for the sample shown here ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the total outflow lifetime is shown as a function of core - hotspot separation in figure 4 .",
    "the fact that the lifetime is independent of core - hotspot separation suggests that each source is being randomly sampled during its lifetime .",
    "typical lifetimes of about @xmath13 years are derived .",
    "total source energies are obtained by taking the product of the beam power and the total source lifetime ; typical outflow energies of about @xmath14 are obtained , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "very powerful classical double radio galaxies provide a powerful tool to study the properties and environments of agn .",
    "these sources have regular radio bridge structures , indicating that they are propagating at speeds well into the supersonic regime and that they have negligible internal backflow speeds ( leahy , muxlow , and stephens 1989 ) .",
    "this means that the equations of strong shock physics can be applied to these systems allowing us to obtain the beam power and ambient gas density of each side of each source from measurements of the source width , pressure , and rate of growth of each side of each source .",
    "in addition , other studies of this type of source indicates a power law relationship between the beam power and total lifetime of the source ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this allows us to obtain an estimate of the total lifetime and outflow energy of each source .",
    "we would like to thank the organizers of the conference , travis rector and dave de young , for making this such a successful conference .",
    "support for this work was provided in part by us national science foundation grant number ast-0507465 ( r. a. d. ) .",
    "this research made use of ( 1 ) the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ; and ( 2 ) nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
