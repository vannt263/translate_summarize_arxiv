    "the historic discovery of neutrino oscillations constitutes the first evidence for physics beyond the standard model , and one would like to know to which direction it is pointing . despite a pretty good knowledge of the neutrino oscillation mechanism and the parameters",
    "involved @xcite , the nature of the mechanism generating masses and mixings remains as elusive as ever .",
    "neutrino mass models fall in various classes  @xcite involving models where neutrinos get mass _ a la seesaw _",
    "@xcite , those where neutrinos acquire mass radiatively due to the presence of extra higgs bosons  @xcite , and hybrid models , like those based on low energy supersymmetry with spontaneous ( or bilinear ) breaking of r - parity  @xcite .",
    "starting with the seesaw  @xcite all those mechanisms carry with them modifications to the structure of the standard electroweak neutral and charged currents .",
    "the simplest of such modifications in the low energy regime may be written in the usual @xmath1 form , similar to the four - fermi interaction , characterized by some new coupling , which we generally call , in what follows , non - standard interactions ( nsi ) .",
    "such interactions can arise in a variety of ways , e.  g. , from the exchange of higgs and/or supersymmetric scalar bosons as well as a new heavy gauge boson , such as a @xmath2 .",
    "non - standard interactions can conserve flavor , their differences characterizing the violation of weak universality , known as non - universal ( nu ) nsi .",
    "alternatively , they may violate flavor conservation , known as flavor changing ( fc ) nsi .",
    "on the other hand , current neutrino oscillation data , as inferred from the solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino experiments , leave significant room for the existence of sub - leading effects induced by nsi .",
    "in fact , nsi effects may be comparable to oscillation effects in solar neutrino physics , where indeed a new degenerate solution is still allowed  @xcite . at this",
    "stage laboratory experiments both from accelerators and reactors can play a crucial role , since the strongest sensitivity to nsi comes from this kind of experiments  @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of oscillation parameters in long baseline oscillation experiments such as neutrino factories will also benefit from improved nsi studies . these could help resolving the confusion between the two found in refs .",
    "@xcite and further discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we address the current sensitivity on non - standard interactions as inferred from a global analysis of processes involving ( anti)-neutrinos and electrons .",
    "previous analyses have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . our current analysis combines the relevant experimental `` neutrino counting '' data from @xmath3 obtained by the four lep collaborations  @xcite , and summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , with all the @xmath4 data obtained by lsnd  @xcite , and the @xmath5 interaction studied in reactor experiments , namely : irvine @xcite , munu @xcite and rovno @xcite . for the muon neutrino case",
    "the relevant reactions are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , measured at charm ii @xcite .",
    "our analysis is also novel in the sense that we adopt a model independent approach , as general as possible , allowing simultaneous variations of all nsi parameters . in particular",
    ", we compare the restrictions obtained varying only one parameter at a time , with those obtained in the case where all six flavor - conserving parameters are left free .",
    "the analysis sketched above is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonst - inter - relev ] the nsi are introduced and the relevant cross sections are expressed as function of nsi parameters , in secs .",
    "[ sec : data ] and [ sec : chi2-analysis ] we briefly present the data and the details of the @xmath8 analysis .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and more discussion and outlook are given in sec . [",
    "sec : discussion ] .",
    "neutrino nsi constitute an unavoidable characteristic feature of gauge models of neutrino mass , for example those where they arise from the admixture of isodoublet and isosinglet neutral leptons , like models of the generic seesaw type  @xcite .",
    "typically the masses of the light neutrinos are obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath9 in the basis @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the standard @xmath12 breaking dirac mass term , and @xmath13 is the large isosinglet majorana mass . in the absence of the isotriplet ( type - ii ) @xmath14 term  @xcite the scheme is called type - i seesaw  @xcite . in models with spontaneous breaking of lepton number symmetry one has @xmath15 , a feature that comes from the study of the scalar potential and holds both in the case of left - right models ( gauged lepton number )  @xcite and the case of majoron models ( ungauged lepton number )  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the associated effective @xmath16 weak @xmath1 currents is rather complex and deviates from standard  @xcite .",
    "the first point to notice is that the heavy isosinglets will mix with the ordinary isodoublet neutrinos in the charged current weak interaction . as a result ,",
    "the mixing matrix describing the charged leptonic weak interaction is a rectangular matrix @xmath17  @xcite which may be decomposed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 matrices .",
    "note that the `` effective '' lepton mixing matrix @xmath19 relevant in oscillation studies is non - unitary  @xcite . for papers addressing possible future tests of such non - unitary effects see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the corresponding neutral weak interactions are described by a non - trivial matrix  @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23    such structure of the charged and neutral weak currents provides an origin for neutrino nsi .",
    "note , however , that the smallness of neutrino mass , which follows due to the seesaw mechanism @xmath24 and the condition @xmath25 implies that , barring fine - tuning , the magnitude of neutrino nsi and its effects are expected to be negligible .",
    "however this need not be so in general . since the number @xmath26 of @xmath27 singlets is arbitrary , one may , for example , extend the lepton sector of the @xmath16 theory by adding a set of _ two _ 2-component isosinglet neutral fermions , denoted @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in each generation . in such @xmath30 models",
    "one can consider the @xmath31 mass matrix  @xcite @xmath32 ( in the basis @xmath33 ) .",
    "the majorana masses for the neutrinos are determined from @xmath34    since in the limit @xmath35 the exact lepton number symmetry is recovered and neutrinos become massless  @xcite this scheme is sometimes called `` inverse seesaw ''  .",
    "this provides an elegant way to generate neutrino masses without a super - heavy scale , the smallness of the neutrino mass indicated by the oscillation interpretation of solar and atmospheric neutrino data is ascribed to the smallness of @xmath36 , which is natural in t hofft s sense : the symmetry of the theory is enhanced in the limit of vanishing @xmath36 .",
    "this automatically allows for a sizeable magnitude of neutrino nsi strengths , unconstrained by the smallness of neutrino masses  .",
    "the nsi which are engendered in this case will necessarily affect neutrino propagation properties in matter , an effect that may be resonant in certain cases  @xcite .",
    "they may also be large enough as to produce effects in the laboratory .",
    "an alternative way to induce neutrino nsi is in the context of low - energy supersymmetry without r - parity conservation  @xcite where one may also have , in addition to bilinear  @xcite also trilinear @xmath37 violating couplings in the super - potential such as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are ( chiral ) super - fields which contain the usual lepton and quark @xmath41 doublets and singlets , respectively , and @xmath42 are generation indices .",
    "the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lq ] ) give rise at low energy to the following four - fermion effective lagrangian for neutrino interactions with @xmath43-quark including @xmath44 where the parameters @xmath45 represent the strength of the effective interactions normalized to the fermi constant @xmath46 .",
    "one can identify explicitly , for example , the following _ non - standard _ flavor - conserving nsi couplings @xmath47 and the fc coupling @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the masses of the exchanged squarks and @xmath50 denotes @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the existence of effective neutral current interactions contributing to the neutrino scattering off @xmath43-quarks in matter , provides new flavor - conserving as well as flavor - changing terms for the matter potentials of neutrinos .",
    "such nsi are directly relevant for solar  @xcite and atmospheric neutrino propagation  @xcite .    in what follows we consider a more general class of non - standard interactions described via the effective four fermion lagrangian , @xmath52 where @xmath46 is the fermi constant and @xmath53 parametrize the strength of the nsi . for laboratory experiments",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis on non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) with electrons including all muon and electron ( anti)-neutrino data from existing accelerators and reactors , in conjunction with the `` neutrino counting '' data ( @xmath0 ) from the four lep collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> first we perform a one - parameter - at - a - time analysis , showing how most constraints improve with respect to previous results reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we also present more robust results where the nsi parameters are allowed to vary freely in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we show the importance of combining lep data with the other experiments in removing degeneracies in the global analysis constraining flavor - conserving nsi parameters which , at 90% and 95%  c.l . </S>",
    "<S> , must lie within unique allowed regions . despite such improved constraints , </S>",
    "<S> there is still substantial room for improvement , posing a big challenge for upcoming experiments . </S>"
