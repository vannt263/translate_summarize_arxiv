    "the network of neurons in the brain exhibits a subtle balance of dynamic chaos and selforganized order .",

    "modern concepts of time - delayed feedback control have recently been applied to suppress this undesired synchrony @xcite .",

    "a control force is constructed from the difference of the current state of a system to its time - delayed counterpart .",
    "previously , it has also been used to influence noise - induced oscillations of a single excitable system @xcite , of systems below a hopf bifurcation @xcite or a global bifurcation @xcite , and of spatially extended reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the work of @xcite by application of a different feedback stimulation with multiple time delays .",

    "in particular , we are interested in the study of the effects of the memory parameter as new control parameter on the synchrony properties in coupled neural systems . we compare this to the case of vanishing memory parameter , as investigated by @xcite , and find that the control scheme is more robust for multiple time - delayed feedback in the sense that enhanced synchronization is independent on the tuning of the time delay .",

    "<S> each system is prepared in the excitable regime and subject to independent random fluctuations . in order to modify their cooperative dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a local external stimulus in form of an extended time - delayed feedback loop that involves multiple delays weighted by a memory parameter and investigate if local control applied to a subsystem can allow one to steer the global cooperative dynamics . depending on the choice of this new control parameter , we investigate different measures to quantify the influence on synchronization : ratio of interspike intervals , power spectrum , interspike interval distribution , and phase synchronization intervals . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the control method is more robust for increasing memory parameter . </S>"
