    "<S> to date , optical manipulation techniques for aqueous dispersions have been developed that deposit and/or transport nanoparticles not only for fundamental studies of colloidal dynamics , but also for either creating photonic devices or allowing accurate control of liquids on micron scales . here </S>",
    "<S> , we report that optical tweezers ( ot ) system is able to direct three - dimensional assembly of graphene , graphite , and carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) into microcapsules of hollow spheres . </S>",
    "<S> the ot technique facilitates both to visualize the elasticity of a cnt microcapsule and to arrange a triplet of identical graphene microcapsules in aqueous media . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the similarity of swelling courses has been found over a range of experimental parameters such as nanocarbon species , the power of the incident light , and the suspension density . thanks to the universality in evolutions of rescaled capsule size , we can precisely control the size of various nanocarbon microcapsules by adjusting the duration time of laser emission .    </S>",
    "<S> carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb - like lattice constitute the common building blocks of not only graphite but also other carbon nanomaterials including fullerene , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , and graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the individual particles of these nanocarbons possess unique mechanical , electronic , and optical properties , and there is a variety of assembly techniques for displaying these properties macroscopically or mesoscopically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the hollow - caged superstructure of the graphene or cnt assembly has been fabricated in several ways @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of methods developed for these capsular organizations are classified as layer - by - layer ( lbl ) assembly techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lbl method includes the step of depositing charged nanocarbon particles on spherical templates , such as polymer colloids and water droplets in oil , and necessarily involves a final step to remove the template cores @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a recent report that cnt assembly is optically directed to form spheres on the ends of optical fibers without the addition of core materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our concern relates to the last finding of optically directed three - dimensional ( 3d ) assembly @xcite , which is further traced back to the optical deposition of cnts or graphene on the end of an optical fiber @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that these aggregates themselves can form photonic devices with fascinating properties such as an ultrafast recovery time , ultrafast saturable absorbance , and optical nonlinearity @xcite ; therefore , capsular structures may have potential applications in electrochemical or photonic devices , as well as in drug delivery and biosensors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the simplicity of the optical process is expected to facilitate practical applications , there remain both technical and fundamental issues as follows : ( i ) the optical fiber system used previously @xcite has difficulty in both fabrication and manipulation , such that the cnt sphere adheres to the end of the fiber during the 3d assembly and must be removed to repeat the optical fabrication using the same fiber @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existing optical techniques @xcite are thus unsuitable for both the sequential processing and the position adjustment . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) furthermore , the growth processes need to be clarified so that we may manage the optical swelling ; it seems difficult to precisely control the capsule size , if it is the microbubble generation by local heating @xcite that plays an essential role in forming the 3d assembly .    here </S>",
    "<S> we settle these problems together using optical tweezers ( ot ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical tweezing is not only among the most established and popular methods for optical trapping and manipulation of micro - and nano - objects including cnts and graphene flakes @xcite , but also provides emerging applications for analysis or transportation including weak force measurements , particle sorting , and optofluidics combined with the microfluidic toolkit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the fiber system , the ot technique is free of any restrictions on the controllability of the distance between the focal point and the surrounding objects , such as the cover slip and a microneedle inserted for manipulations . taking full advantage of the versatility of this technique </S>",
    "<S> , the technical limitations associated with the fiber systems could be overcome .    in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we aim to demonstrate that the ot method is capable of tuning the size and configuration of nanocarbon capsules ; for instance , a desired configuration of microcapsule arrays is created in aqueous media . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the controllability of capsule size is validated from investigating a variety of swelling kinetics in dispersed nanocarbons such as cnts , graphenes and graphites . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the nanocarbon species , we have changed the experimental parameters including the solvent temperature @xmath0 , the incident laser power @xmath1 , and the density @xmath2 of nanocarbon dispersoids .      * </S>",
    "<S> manipulating nanocarbon microcapsules*. the technical point , which we have discovered , is to place the laser focus of ot system above an ordinary cover slip on which a drop of nanocarbon suspension is mounted , so that one could find that a spherical nanocarbon assembly , whose center is located at the focal point , is swelling larger as the duration time of laser emission is longer ( see fig.1(a ) as a schematic of the growth process ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have adhered a swollen cnt sphere to a tungsten microneedle by the position adjustment of both the microcapsule and microneedle using the ot system and micromanipulator , respectively , which enables one not only to lift the attached object from the substrate by positional control of the microneedle , but also to rotate the cnt sphere together with the attached microneedle ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and supplementary movie 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the in situ observations , the 3d structure of spherical shape has been clarified .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and supplementary movie 2 , we see that capsule deformation is induced by exerting mechanical stress on a sandwiched cnt microcapsule via a pair of microneedles . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation to the initial isotropic state , observed in movie 2 , exhibits that the elasticity is imparted by the void space . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been found from long - term observation that confined 3-@xmath3 m colloids continue to undergo brownian motion without permeating the carbon shell ( see supplementary movie 3 ) , which suggests no holes of several microns on the spherical surface .    </S>",
    "<S> the ot system is also able to create a triangular array of graphene microcapsules ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) which are detachable from each other , by adjusting the focal position independently of that of the cover slip . </S>",
    "<S> these microcapsules have an almost equal diameter , because they are fabricated by changing the focal position from one point to another at regular intervals with the laser path shuttered while maintaining the solvent temperature @xmath0 at @xmath4 .    * a universal behavior of growth processes*. for systematically accomplishing the size - control , </S>",
    "<S> various growth processes need to be quantified ; therefore , we have measured the diameter @xmath5 of a swelling microcapsule at a time specified by @xmath6 , which is almost equal to the duration of the laser emission . strictly speaking , the initial time , @xmath7 , was operationally defined by the instant when the ccd camera used for the long - term observations began to detect an optically deposited nucleate .    </S>",
    "<S> as a minimal model to reproduce the swelling kinetics of nanocarbon microcapsules , we consider a typical equation of relaxational phenomena : @xmath8 whose solution is given by @xmath9 ,     </S>",
    "<S> \\label{solution}\\\\     d_{\\mathrm{max}}&= &     \\tau v_{\\mathrm{dc}}.     \\label{max }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the relaxation time and the dc component of the swelling velocity , respectively , @xmath12 denotes the maximum diameter at saturation , and @xmath13 the emergence time defined mathematically : @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( 1 ) describes the competition between the dc component @xmath11 of driving velocity for swelling and the declining rate @xmath15 against expansion . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the maximum diameter @xmath12 is given by the ratio of @xmath11 to @xmath15 ( see eq . ( [ max ] ) ) .    as found from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solution ] ) , the time evolution of rescaled size @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 depends only on time parameters of @xmath10 , @xmath18 , and an arbitrary reference time @xmath19 : @xmath20 which implies that a universal curve of @xmath16 is delineated by collecting various growth processes with similar times of both emergence and relaxation .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic universality , predicted by eq . ( [ rescaling ] ) , has been corroborated by gathering various swelling processes at @xmath4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 where the normalized size @xmath16 is plotted consistently using an identical reference time @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we set that @xmath21 sec . because growing cnt microcapsules at the maximal power of 240 mw became unstable beyond the present duration time and showed a sudden drop in diameter prior to saturation ( see fig . 4 and supplementary movie 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 exhibits the generic kinetics at @xmath4 , which is common to the incident laser power , suspension density and nanocarbon species . </S>",
    "<S> we can describe the universal behavior by applying eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rescaling ] ) to the rescaled length as before , and both fitting curves of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and 3(b ) obtain @xmath22 sec . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 . in supplementary tables </S>",
    "<S> s1 and s2 , we have fitting results for a variety of @xmath5 without rescaling , which are in the range of @xmath24 and @xmath25 when incident laser powers , suspension densities and nanocarbon species are varied . </S>",
    "<S> these variances of @xmath10 and @xmath18 underlie the universality depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the rescaled plot of @xmath16 facilitates to discriminate the variance in @xmath26 and/or @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the duration of the laser emission at @xmath27 was also determined , using a fast cmos camera , which was approximately two seconds consistently with the fitting result of @xmath26 ; incidentally , the fast cmos camera detected the emergence of carbon nucleates after a mean laser duration of about one second irrespectively of experimental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> * swelling mechanism*. both the symmetric shape and the hollow space of more than 100 @xmath3 m in diameter reveal that the ot system is exerting an isotropic pressure over a long - ranged scale around the focal point , which suggests the existence of an optofluidic flow other than the inherent anisotropic force due to the optical gradient or scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the details of @xmath5 without use of the rescaled plot so that it may be explored what are determining factors of inducing the optofluidic flow .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the change of @xmath5 when the incident laser power @xmath1 at the focal point or the suspension density @xmath2 varies , from which we extrapolate that the capsule diameter at saturation is larger with increase of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary tables s1 and s2 , the fitting results using eq . ( 2 ) , actually verify that @xmath12 is increased by raising @xmath1 and is slightly larger for a higher density of cnts , whereas @xmath11 is enhanced by increasing @xmath1 but is weakly dependent on @xmath2 ; at the maximal power of @xmath28 mw , we have found it difficult to appropriately fit eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) to the corresponding data , due to the capsule breaking at an intermediate stage ( see supplementary movie 4 as well as fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11-dependencies on @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be explained by the change of temperature difference @xmath29 between the focal temperature @xmath30 and the solvent temperature maintained at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the amount of absorbed light increases with increase of @xmath1 before reaching the saturation limit @xcite , as well as nanocarbon density of the focal deposition which is not necessarily proportional to the bulk concentration @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the focal temperature @xmath30 becomes higher while the solvent temperature remains @xmath4 , thereby creating a larger thermal gradient due to the increase of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the aforementioned increment of @xmath11 is ascribable to the steepening of thermal gradient @xcite which is caused by elevating @xmath1 and is induced to some extent by increasing @xmath2 ; it is to be noted that the marginal @xmath2-contribution arises not only from the nonlinear relation between the bulk and deposited densities , but also from the enhancement of depositing flow with increase of @xmath2 , which is in the opposite direction of @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> we also changed the solvent temperature @xmath0 , as well as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 compares the time dependencies of @xmath5 in cnt suspensions at @xmath4 and @xmath31 with the other parameters equally set to @xmath32 mw and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical micrograph in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 represents an initial state at @xmath31 where the duration of the laser emission , determined using a fast cmos camera , was approximately two seconds as mentioned before , which displays that the capsule interior is filled with microbubbles in the initial stage . this microscopy image in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 also exhibits not only a minimal size of generated microcapsules , but also a shell thickness of approximately 20 @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent generation of microbubbles has revealed that the cnt dispersoids actually absorb light and raise the focal temperature @xmath30 in the present experimental conditions , as reported so far @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the optical microscopy of cnt microcapsules at @xmath4 is unable to distinguish microbubbles even at the maximal laser power ( see supplementary movie 4 ) . despite the clear difference in observations , these growth processes have a common feature that the increasing rate of @xmath5 is explosively large at the initial stage , and subsequently slows down toward the saturated state .    despite the clear difference in observations , these growth processes have a common feature that the increasing rate of @xmath5 is explosively large at the initial stage , and subsequently slows down toward the saturated state . comparing the long - time behaviors of @xmath5 at different solvent temperatures in fig . 5 </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that @xmath12 is smaller in a higher - temperature solvent ( @xmath31 ) . according to the fitting results in supplementary table </S>",
    "<S> s3 , @xmath11 is scarcely varied , whereas @xmath10 is reduced larger in correspondence with the decrease of solvent viscosity @xmath34 due to the increase of @xmath0 : we have @xmath35 , with the subscripts denoting the solvent temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the reduction of the maximum diameter @xmath12 is mainly caused by the viscosity diminishment associated with the @xmath0-change . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that the increase of @xmath0 makes a little change in the temperature difference @xmath29 , and that the existence of microbubbles is not essential in enhancing the capsule growth beyond the viscosity reduction due to the increase of @xmath0 , which is consistent with the previous observations of microbubbles as scavengers of dispersed cnts @xcite .      to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , the ot system has been found to be a fascinating tool for tuning the size and configuration of nanocarbon microcapsules in aqueous media , which is ensured by a universal behavior of swelling courses that applies to a range of incident light power @xmath1 , nanocarbon density @xmath2 , and nanocarbon species as displayed by fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> our finding of the generic kinetics enables one to efficiently control the capsule size by interpolating the appropriate duration time of laser emission even in an intermediate condition of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 .    for addressing the swelling mechanism in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , one should note the fitting results in fig . 5 ( see also supplementary table s3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the reduction of the maximum diameter @xmath12 is mainly caused by the viscosity diminishment associated with the @xmath0-change . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath0 makes a little change in the temperature difference @xmath29 , and that the existence of microbubbles is not essential in enhancing the capsule growth beyond the viscosity reduction due to the increase of @xmath0 , which is consistent with the previous observations of microbubbles as scavengers of cnts , instead of the dispersers @xcite .    combining the @xmath0-dependence with the kinetic variations due to the change of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) , we conclude that the optical swelling of deposited nanocarbons does not necessarily require the existence of microbubbles , and that a key candidate of swelling factors is optofluidic migration , such as thermophoresis of nanocarbons , induced by the thermal gradient @xcite ; however , an elaborate theory remains to be developed based on the recent advances in the theoretical treatments of thermal dynamics for colloids @xcite , aiming to validate the phenomenological equation ( 1 ) , and to elucidate why the relaxation times are close as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , it is an open problem whether microbubbles , which optical microscopy at @xmath4 had difficulty in detecting , are indispensable for the nucleation of hollow microcapsule ( or the optical deposition of cnts @xcite ) that emerges from the homogeneous dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note a technical advantage of the ot method . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1 and 2 , as well as supplementary movies 1 and 2 , have demonstrated that the ot method is able not only to fabricate nanocarbon microcapsule arrays of required configuration , but also to manipulate and deform a single microcapsule . the use of programmed ot system </S>",
    "<S> would be helpful for fabricating more complicated configurations than the triangular arrays of microcapsules ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) , though any polymerization in the shells is further required in order to prevent the dried microcapsules from collapsing . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ot system is capable of accomplishing an alternative lbl assembly : a cnt microcapsule can be easily covered with a graphene shell by simply exchanging the surrounding suspension . </S>",
    "<S> we envisage the use of the ot method for creating various arrays of hybrid nanocarbon microcapsules that meet engineering demands @xcite .      * materials*. we used the aqueous suspensions of carboxylated multi - walled cnts ( 3 wt% , cluster instruments ) , which was diluted to densities of 0.05 wt% and 0.025 wt% . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , to prepare aqueous 0.025 wt% dispersions of graphite , we wrapped the carbon dispersoids with dna via the following procedure , the same steps in preparing aqueous solution from unmodified cnt soot : the graphite powder ( 2 @xmath3 m in average size , ito graphite ) was suspended by sonication in an aqueous solution with 0.025-wt% salmon dna ( wako ) that was denatured by heating for ten minutes at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the suspensions were centrifuged at 650 g for ten minutes to extract the carefully decanted supernatants . </S>",
    "<S> we also used a graphene suspension ( nanointegris ) with a density of 5 wt% . </S>",
    "<S> for all of the experiments , a 100-@xmath3l drop of the suspension was mounted on an ordinary cover slip ( neo , matsunami ) . </S>",
    "<S> no seals were used for eliminating a boundary effect on the swelling processes , so that microcapsules could be manipulated using microneedles ; incidentally , we verified that the open densification of the drops due to optical heating for five minutes yielded a maximal change in the density of the suspension of less than 10 % . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical colloids used are carboxylate - modified polystyrene particles ( 3 @xmath3 m in diameter , dainichi seika ) , which were included with the nanocarbon microcapsules to track brownian motions of the confined particles .    * </S>",
    "<S> experimental setup*. the ot system ( mms , sigma koki ) is composed of an inverted optical microscope ( te2000-u , nikon ) with an objective lens ( plan fluor elwd @xmath37 , nikon ) , a cw nd : yag laser ( @xmath38 ) , and other optical devices including a ccd camera ( retiga exi , q - imaging ) and a fast cmos camera ( pl - a741 , pixelink ) . </S>",
    "<S> the microscope stage was heated with a silicone rubber electric heating sheet and was maintained at either @xmath39 or @xmath40 using a temperature controller ( db1000 , chino ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light intensity at the focal point ranged from 5 mw to 300 mw , and the longest laser emission duration was 250 seconds . to manipulate the hollow microcapsules , we used a tungsten microneedle with a tip diameter of 500 nm under the control of a patch clamp micromanipulator ( nmn-21 , narishige ) . </S>"
