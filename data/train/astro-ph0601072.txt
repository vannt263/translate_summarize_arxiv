    "interstellar molecular clouds have nonthermal line widths which are typically supersonic and increase with the scale of the cloud size that is measured ( e.g. , larson 1981 ; myers 1983 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ; brunt & heyer 2002 ) . for a cloud scale",
    "@xmath7 pc , the velocity dispersion @xmath8 , which is several times greater than the isothermal sound speed @xmath9 for a typical cloud temperature @xmath10 ( goldsmith & langer 1978 ) .",
    "when detectable through the zeeman effect , magnetic field strengths are such that their influence is comparable to that of gravity ( crutcher 1999 ) and velocity dispersions are correlated with the mean alfvn   speeds @xmath11 such that @xmath12 ( crutcher 1999 ; basu 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , maps of polarized emission from dust imply that the magnetic field morphology is relatively well - ordered and therefore not dominated by turbulence ( e.g. , schleuning 1998 ; matthews & wilson 2000 ; houde et al .",
    "it seems possible that turbulence within molecular clouds comprises a spectrum of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves generated from various localized sources and from self - gravitational motions .",
    "in contrast to the large - scale structuring by turbulence and magnetic fields , we note that the embedded dense cores in regions of low - mass star formation have characteristically subsonic or transonic turbulence ; evidence for gravitational collapse in cores also comes in the form of subsonic infall motions where detectable ( see discussion and references in myers 2005 ) .",
    "although not possessing internal motions as highly supersonic as some larger , more distant molecular clouds , the well - resolved taurus molecular cloud complex ( distance @xmath13 pc ) reveals a hierarchy of density and size scales that is characteristic of star - forming regions ( see ungerechts & thaddeus 1987 ; mizuno et al .",
    "1995 ; onishi et al . 1998 ; onishi et al .",
    "the cloud has a common ( turbulent ) envelope of molecular column density @xmath14 ( corresponding to visual extinction @xmath15 ) , embedded parsec - scale dark clouds with @xmath16 and velocity dispersion @xmath17 , which in turn contain dense regions with an average @xmath18 that are forming small clusters of stars .",
    "the typical separation of young stellar objects within the dense regions may be understood by a simple jeans - like fragmentation process for an isothermal dense sheet or filament ( hartmann 2002 ) .",
    "such an approach ignores the effect of turbulence , which is not measured to be large in those regions anyway .",
    "however , the subsonic infall motions imply that a fragmentation process mediated by magnetic fields and ion - neutral friction may be more appropriate ( basu & ciolek 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we extend a previous set of models ( see kudoh & basu 2003 , hereafter paper i ) which approximate conditions within the molecular cloud envelopes and outer regions of dark clouds .",
    "these regions are expected to be sufficiently ionized by the far - ultraviolet background starlight that the ideal mhd limit of flux - freezing is applicable ( mckee 1989 ) .",
    "some key questions about cloud envelopes are as follows .",
    "what is the rate of dissipation of the waves and what is the primary dissipation mechanism ? is continual driving of the turbulence necessary to explain their ubiquitous presence in all but the densest regions ?",
    "furthermore , observed properties of the turbulence such as the line - width  size relation ( e.g. , solomon et al . 1987 ) and the correlation between magnetic field strength , line width , and density ( myers & goodman 1988 ; basu 2000 ) deserve an explanation .    since the late 1990 s , a set of three - dimensional models of mhd turbulence",
    "have been developed which use a _ local _ approach , i.e. , use periodic boundary conditions ( e.g. , stone , gammie , & ostriker 1998 ; mac low et al . 1998 ; mac low 1999 ; padoan & nordlund 1999 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ) .",
    "this means that the modeled regions represent a very small region deep within a molecular cloud .",
    "however , they are driven with highly supersonic motions characteristic of large - scale molecular cloud structure .",
    "although these models are local , the turbulent driving is global , in that large amplitude momentum fluctuations are input at every grid point .",
    "the fluctuations are drawn from a gaussian random field with a specified root mean squared amplitude and power spectrum .",
    "although this method is convenient , a more likely scenario for molecular cloud turbulence is that it is driven from local sources and propagates to fill the clouds .",
    "a main result of the periodic - box models is that the decay time of the mhd turbulence is comparable to the crossing time over the driving scale of the turbulence .",
    "for instance , stone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a turbulent dissipation rate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fixed mean density in the periodic simulation box , @xmath21 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath3 is the driving scale of turbulence . a direct application of this result to large molecular clouds has been questioned by basu & murali ( 2001 ) , who point out that dissipation proportional to the crossing time across internal driving scales would lead to a co emission luminosity @xmath22 far exceeding that observed for clouds whose size is much larger than the driving scale .",
    "alternatively , they point out that the observed scaling of @xmath22 with cloud mass can be explained if the relevant length scale for dissipation is the largest scale @xmath23 of any cloud ; this also yields the correct order of magnitude for @xmath22 itself . in the context of a periodic box model",
    ", this means that the driving would have to occur only on the largest scales of each cloud .",
    "mckee ( 1999 ) also questions extremely fast dissipation , on the grounds that : ( 1 ) turbulence should not be so ubiquitous ( and present for example in clouds with or without embedded ob associations , a possible major source of stellar - driven turbulence ) if it is decaying so rapidly ; ( 2 ) dissipation times of at least a few cloud crossing times ( as opposed to a free - fall time ) may explain the relatively low galactic star formation rate ; and ( 3 ) current simulations can not resolve the turbulence within the dense clumps that quickly develop .",
    "sugimoto , hanawa , & fukuda ( 2004 ) have supported the last point with second - order accurate three - dimensional numerical studies of alfvn  wave propagation , finding that @xmath24 grid points per wavelength are necessary to reduce dissipation to 1% per wavelength propagated .",
    "such a high resolution remains prohibitive for three - dimensional simulations that seek to model large - scale cloud dynamics and dense core formation .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) have also questioned a common interpretation of three - dimensional periodic box models , i.e. , that the fast dissipation is due to the coupling of alfvn  modes to the more dissipative fast mhd and slow mhd modes ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "1998 ) . through modal analysis of their three - dimensional simulations",
    ", they find that the coupling of modes is rather weak in the inertial range of turbulence and that dissipation of alfvn  waves is dominated by a nonlinear cascade .",
    "furthermore , cho , lazarian , & vishniac ( 2002 ) have found that in the case of incompressible mhd turbulence , a directionality in the flux of energy ( as may be expected with localized driving sources ) leads to a significantly lower dissipation rate .",
    "in addition to the detailed analysis of individual wave modes as described above , new approaches to the numerical study of mhd turbulence include extremely high resolution models of the _ global _ structure of molecular clouds ( kudoh & basu 2003 ; folini , heyvaerts , & walder 2004 ) .",
    "these one - dimensional models employ a numerical resolution that remains beyond the reach of three - dimensional simulations .",
    "kudoh & basu ( 2003 , hereafter paper i ) have modeled the global structure of a one - dimensional cold cloud that is embedded in a hotter external medium . the main advantage over a local ( periodic box ) approach is the inclusion of the effects of cloud stratification and a cloud edge .",
    "furthermore , the turbulent driving is localized and the propagation of disturbances within the cloud as well as their leakage from the cloud can be studied . our model in paper",
    "i had 50 numerical cells within the scale length @xmath5 of the initial state , and 70 cells within the wavelength @xmath3 associated with turbulent driving .",
    "results included the generation of significant density structure and shock fronts within the cloud ; however , most of the wave energy remained in transverse , rather than longitudinal motions ( in qualitative agreement with the results of cho & lazarian 2003 ) and the time - averaged density profile of the cloud ( which may be similar to an observed spatial average of many layers along the line - of - sight ) was relatively smooth .",
    "the localized driving led to turbulence which quickly filled the cloud , causing cloud expansion and large - scale oscillations in the outer regions ; all this is aided by a clear transfer of energy to the largest scales of the expanded cloud , due to the stratification and consequent increase of alfvn  speed toward the cloud edge . the work of folini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who model a very similar system with similar turbulent driving , confirm the existence of highly disturbed density structure , oscillatory motions , and a dominance of wave energy in transverse modes .",
    "they focus most extensively on the density structuring and demonstrate that progressively finer scale structuring and enhanced cloud support is revealed by higher resolution simulations ; for typical dimensional values of physical parameters , their numerical resolution is 0.001 pc , as in our models in paper i. in paper i , we also considered many global properties of the clouds .",
    "we found that random motions were greatest in the outer , low - density regions of the clouds in a way that the velocity dispersion @xmath21 and cloud scale @xmath23 satisfied the observed line - width  size relation .",
    "our model also showed that even when turbulence decays away due to lack of driving , the large - scale oscillations are the longest lived component .",
    "these results can help to explain the observations of apparent oscillations of b68 ( lada et al .",
    "2003 ) , a dark cloud in which nonthermal motions are small .",
    "we also showed that the overall dissipation of turbulent energy ( after driving is discontinued ) is proportional to the crossing time across the expanded cloud , rather than the crossing time for the driving wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "this result points to a way out of the problems with internal driving pointed out by basu & murali ( 2001 ) .",
    "stratification leads to turbulence at the largest scales , so that the cloud scale @xmath23 is more relevant to turbulent dissipation than the internal driving scale @xmath3 , as needed on empirical grounds .",
    "we quantify the effect of turbulence on large scales further in this paper by considering the power spectrum of fluctuations in the turbulent clouds .",
    "this paper expands upon the study of paper i and summarizes the results of a parameter study .",
    "the numerical model is presented in   2 .",
    "the results of the simulations are described in   3 .",
    "a summary and discussion are presented in   4 .",
    "the basic model is the same as presented in paper i. we consider a molecular cloud that is threaded by a large - scale magnetic field and assume ideal mhd motions .",
    "we assume a driving force near the midplane of the cloud and follow the dynamical evolution of the vertical structure of the cloud .",
    "our model can be characterized as 1.5-dimensional , since we calculate variations in only one direction but allow vector quantities to have both a longitudinal and a transverse component ( see details in   [ basic ] ) .",
    "we also assume isothermality for each lagrangian fluid element .",
    "this means that the temperature does not change in time for each fluid element as it moves through eulerian space .",
    "since we have a two - temperature model ( cloud and intercloud medium ) , this is not the same as a purely isothermal model .",
    "we use local cartesian coordinates @xmath25 on the molecular cloud , where we set @xmath26 to be the direction of the large - scale magnetic field . according to the symmetry of the 1.5-dimensional approximation",
    ", we set @xmath27 the above symmetry and the divergence - free condition on the magnetic field imply @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath26-component of the magnetic field that threads the molecular cloud .",
    "moreover , from the assumption of linear polarization of the waves , we can set @xmath30 without loss of generality , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33-components of the velocity and magnetic field , respectively .    under this assumption",
    ", we solve the mhd equations numerically . in the equations",
    ", @xmath34 is the time , @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , @xmath36 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath37 is the mean molecular mass , @xmath38 is the density , @xmath39 is the pressure , @xmath40 is the temperature , @xmath41 is the @xmath26-component of the gravitational field , @xmath42 is the @xmath26-component of velocity , @xmath43 is the @xmath44-component of velocity , and @xmath45 is the @xmath44-component of the magnetic field . in the equations , the energy equation is assumed to be @xmath46 which quantifies the assumption of isothermality for each lagrangian fluid element .      as an initial condition , we assume hydrostatic equilibrium of a self - gravitating one - dimensional cloud .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium is calculated from the equations @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath20 and @xmath53 are the initial density and temperature at @xmath54 , respectively .    in order to solve the above equations , we need to assume an initial temperature distribution .",
    "if the temperature is uniform throughout the region , we have the following analytic solution @xmath55 found by spitzer ( 1942 ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the scale length , and @xmath58 is the isothermal sound speed for temperature @xmath53 .",
    "however , an isothermal molecular cloud is usually surrounded by warm or hot material , such as neutral hydrogen or ionized gas .",
    "therefore , we assume the initial temperature distribution to be @xmath59,\\ ] ] where we take @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 throughout the paper .",
    "this distribution shows that the temperature is uniform and equal to @xmath53 in the region of @xmath63 and smoothly increases to another uniform value @xmath64 at @xmath65 . by using this temperature distribution",
    ", we can solve the ordinary differential equations ( [ eq : hdsr])-([eq : hdsp ] ) numerically .",
    "we also assume the following initial conditions : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant . according to equation ( [ eq : bz ] ) ,",
    "@xmath29 is spatially uniform and independent of time throughout the calculations .",
    "we introduce a perturbation into the initially hydrostatic cloud by adding a driving force , @xmath70 , into the @xmath44-component of the momentum equation as follows : @xmath71    in this paper , we use two forms of the driving force .",
    "the first one , which is the same as in paper i , is the sinusoidal driving force defined by @xmath72 & ( t<10t_0 ) \\\\",
    "\\rho a_d \\sin(2\\pi \\nu_0 t ) \\exp[-(\\frac{z}{z_a})^2 ]   & ( 10t_0 \\leq t \\leq   40t_0 ) \\\\ 0   & ( t > 40 t_0 ) ,   \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : driving2}\\ ] ] and @xmath73 in this form , @xmath74 is the amplitude of the induced acceleration , @xmath75 is the frequency of the driving force , and @xmath76 represents the region in which we input the driving force .",
    "the other form we use is the random driving force : @xmath77 & ( t<10t_0 ) \\\\",
    "\\rho a_d { \\rm ran}(t ) \\exp[-(\\frac{z}{z_a})^2 ]   & ( 10t_0 \\leq t \\leq   40t_0 ) \\\\ 0   & ( t > 40 t_0 ) ,   \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : drivingr}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is a random number between -1 and 1 which is determined at each time step .",
    "these equations show that we input the driving force near the midplane of the cloud , and increase the maximum driving force linearly with time until @xmath79 , and maintain it to be constant during @xmath80 .",
    "after @xmath81 , we terminate the driving force .      we used a mirror symmetric boundary condition at @xmath54 and a free boundary at @xmath82 , the outer boundary of the calculation . in order to remove the reflection of waves at the outer boundary , we set @xmath83 to be a large value , and use nonuniform grid spacing for large @xmath26 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the grid spacing is @xmath85 ; most of the @xmath86 points in a typical simulation are concentrated in this region .",
    "such high resolution is feasible in a 1.5-dimensional simulation and ensures that the dissipation rate is determined by physical effects like a nonlinear cascade and nonlinear steepening rather than by direct numerical diffusion ( see details in paper i ) .    in order to solve the equations numerically",
    ", we use the cip method ( e.g. , yabe , xiao & utsumi 2001 ) and the mocct method ( stone & norman 1992 ) .",
    "the combination of the cip and mocct methods is summarized in kudoh , matsumoto & shibata ( 1999 ) .",
    "the cip method is a useful method to solve an advection equation such as equation ( [ eq : tlag ] ) accurately , and is also applicable to advection terms of hydrodynamic equations . due to the mirror - symmetric boundary condition at @xmath54 , the poisson equation can be simply integrated from the midplane of the cloud .",
    "a natural set of fundamental units for this problem are @xmath87 , @xmath5 , and @xmath20 .",
    "these yield a time unit @xmath88 .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength introduces one dimensionless free parameter , i.e. @xmath89 which is the initial ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at @xmath54 .    in this cloud , @xmath1 is related to the mass - to - flux ratio . for spitzer s self - gravitating cloud",
    ", the mass - to - flux ratio normalized to the critical value is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the column density of the spitzer s self - gravitating cloud .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 the column density of the cloud we used in this paper is almost equal to that of spitzer s cloud .",
    "if we define the column density of the cloud , @xmath93 , as the integral of density within @xmath94 , then @xmath95 this means that we can use the value of @xmath96 an excellent approximation to the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of the model cloud .",
    "the driving force introduces three more free parameters : @xmath97 , the dimensionless amplitude of the acceleration due to driving ; @xmath98 , the dimensionless frequency of driving ; @xmath99 , the dimensionless scale of the driving region . for simplicity , we take @xmath100 throughout this paper .",
    "dimensional values of all quantities can be found through a choice of @xmath53 and @xmath20 , along with the values of the dimensionless free parameters .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 yr , and @xmath107 if @xmath108 .      due to the nonlinearity and inherent randomness in the model , a non - negligible mean transverse motion of the cloud can be set up after a few cycles of turbulent driving . in order to exclude the energy of the mean transverse cloud motion from our analysis of turbulent motions , we introduce ( as in paper i ) the oscillating component of the @xmath44-velocity , @xmath109 where @xmath110 in this equation , @xmath111 is the mean @xmath112velocity of the cloud and @xmath113 is the full mass position of the cloud , which is defined by @xmath114 this means that @xmath113 corresponds to the position of the lagrangian fluid element which is initially located at @xmath115 , the initial position of the transition region of the temperature .    in equation ( [ eq : vyosc ] ) , we take a time average of @xmath111 for each cycle of the sinusoidal period ( @xmath116 ) of the driving force in order to remove the oscillation caused by the driving force .",
    "the time average , @xmath117 , is defined in the following manner .",
    "for example , @xmath117 between @xmath118 and @xmath119 is calculated as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is an integer . according to the definition",
    ", @xmath117 has the same value between @xmath118 and @xmath119 . when the driving force is random , there is really no period . in this case",
    ", we choose @xmath122 for convenience .",
    "table 1 summarizes the parameter study we have performed .",
    "the first 5 models with different @xmath123 are the same as presented in paper i. in this paper , we primarily discuss the results of varying @xmath124 and @xmath1 , as well as the effect of a random driving force .",
    "we describe in detail a subset of the full range of models listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of models with different frequencies @xmath2 .",
    "the left panel shows the model with @xmath125 , the middle panel shows the model with @xmath126 , and the right panel shows the model with @xmath127 ; all models have @xmath128 and @xmath108 . for each model ,",
    "the upper panels show the time evolution of the density .",
    "the density profile at various times are stacked with time increasing upward in uniform increments of @xmath129 .",
    "the lower panels show the time evolution of @xmath130 at @xmath54 , where @xmath130 is the oscillating component of the @xmath44-velocity that we defined in the previous section .",
    "as we have shown in paper i , each density evolution plot shows many shock waves propagating in the cloud and significant upward and downward motions of the outer portion of the cloud during the period of constant energy input ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the cloud undergoes more expansion and the amplitude of @xmath130 becomes greater when the frequency is lower .",
    "we return to this point after examining the effect of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 presents the same physical quantities as figure 1 , but for models with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the left panel shows the model with @xmath132 , the middle panel shows the model with @xmath133 , and the right panel shows the model with @xmath134 ; all models have @xmath128 and @xmath126 .",
    "when @xmath132 , the cloud hardly expands , showing no shock waves or large up - down motions .",
    "the velocity amplitude @xmath130 at @xmath54 is quite small in comparison to other models , and typically subsonic .",
    "this model has the strongest magnetic field for a given density , and corresponds to the most magnetically subcritical case .",
    "when @xmath133 , the cloud shows large oscillations , although there are not as many shock waves as in the standard model with @xmath108 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "the case of @xmath134 shows the greatest velocity amplitude @xmath130 at the midplane , and many shock waves .",
    "this is consistent with the trend set by other models that a weaker magnetic field leads to greater disturbances at the midplane for a given driving amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath134 model is significantly magnetically supercritical ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the trend established for increasing @xmath1 by the other models , the cloud does not expand nearly as much as in the @xmath133 or @xmath108 models .",
    "the differences in the level of cloud expansion for the models with differing @xmath2 and/or @xmath1 can be understood in part by considering the different wavelengths of the input driving .",
    "the input wavelength @xmath136 is estimated from the alfvn  velocity at the midplane @xmath137 and the period @xmath53 of the driving force : @xmath138 for the models presented in figure 1 with @xmath139 , the corresponding input wavelengths are @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the model with @xmath141 has an input wavelength closest to that of the initial cloud size ( @xmath142 ) , and this leads to the greatest effect of cloud expansion due to the pressure of the nonlinear waves .",
    "this correlation is borne out further by examining the models of different @xmath1 presented in figure 2 . when @xmath132 and @xmath126 , in addition to the low amplitude fluctuations @xmath130 due to the very strong magnetic field , we also have @xmath143 , which is larger than the initial cloud size . hence , the waves are not effective at providing an internal pressure .",
    "when @xmath133 and @xmath126 we find @xmath144 , which is approximately the same as the initial cloud size . on the other hand , when @xmath134 and @xmath126 we get @xmath145 , which is significantly smaller than the cloud size .",
    "even though there are large velocity fluctuations @xmath130 at the midplane in this model due to the relatively weak magnetic field , the overall expansion of the cloud is inhibited by the relatively small ratio @xmath146 .",
    "our overall results indicate that the cloud suffers less expansion when the driving wavelength is larger than the initial cloud size , and the cloud is lifted up the most when the driving wavelength is approximately the same as the initial cloud size .",
    "figure 3 and figure 4 show other models which differ from the standard model in the values of _ two _ separate parameters .",
    "the left panel of figure 3 shows the model with @xmath133 and @xmath125 , while the right panel shows the model with @xmath134 and @xmath125 ; both models have @xmath128 .",
    "the driving wavelength @xmath147 for the model in the left panel , and @xmath148 for the model in the right panel .",
    "these two panels are the low frequency counterparts of the middle and right panels of figure 2 , respectively .",
    "figure 3 also shows that the cloud suffers a lesser expansion when the driving wavelength is larger than the cloud size .",
    "the left panel of figure 4 shows the model with @xmath133 and @xmath127 , and the right panel shows the model with @xmath134 and @xmath127 ; both models have @xmath128 .",
    "the driving wavelength is @xmath144 for the model in the left panel , and @xmath149 for the model in the right panel .",
    "these two models are the high frequency counterparts of the models in figure 3 .",
    "in contrast to figure 3 , the model with @xmath133 shows greater expansion because the wavelength is comparable to the initial cloud size , while the model with @xmath134 shows very little expansion since the driving wavelength is much smaller than than the initial cloud size .    in figure 5 , we show the results of the models with a random driving force .",
    "the models have different values of @xmath1 and the same dimensionless amplitude @xmath150 .",
    "since the random driving contains various frequencies , the time evolution of the density is not significantly different from model to model .",
    "each model has a component of the driving at the wavelength ( which is a function of @xmath1 ) that is comparable to the cloud size .",
    "however , the amplitudes of @xmath130 are a little different in each model .",
    "when the magnetic field is strong ( @xmath133 ) , the amplitude is smaller , and vice versa .",
    "this result is consistent with the results presented in figure 2 .    to conclude this section , we reemphasize that the wavelength of the driving force is an important parameter for the cloud evolution .",
    "the driving wavelength which is comparable to the cloud size has the greatest effect in expanding the cloud .",
    "thus , the expansion can not be attributed primarily to the commonly used notion of `` turbulent pressure '' , which requires that the wavelength of disturbances be much smaller than the typical scale length of the cloud ( see bonnazola et al .",

    "figure 6 shows the time evolution of energies in the cloud for the case of random driving , @xmath150 and @xmath108 .",

    "strictly speaking , the total energy in each case is twice the value we calculate due to the mirror symmetric boundary condition at @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eky ] ) shows that the mean kinetic energy of the cloud is subtracted from the kinetic energy of the the @xmath44-component of the velocity , so that @xmath157 is the kinetic energy of the oscillatory motions .    in figure 6",
    ", we examine the evolution of various energies for the random driving force model with @xmath150 and @xmath108 .",

    "the values of each energy are smoothed out over a time @xmath161 to remove small oscillations .",

    "@xmath159 is significantly smaller , i.e. , there is approximate equipartition in transverse kinetic energy and magnetic fields , and there is much less energy in longitudinal modes .",
    "longitudinal modes can be generated by the gradient of magnetic field pressure in the @xmath26-direction .",
    "however , the dominance of the transverse modes implies that the primary dissipation mechanisms are the nonlinear cascade and nonlinear steepening effects that transfer energy to progressively smaller scales until it is dissipated at the grid scale ( see more extensive discussion in paper i ) . after the driving force",
    "is terminated at @xmath81 , the energies decrease almost exponentially .",
    "the @xmath162-folding time is @xmath163 , which is approximately a sound crossing time across the cloud size as expanded by the turbulent pressure .",
    "the turbulent energy is nearly completely dissipated within a few of these crossing times .",
    "all of this is consistent with the results for sinusoidal driving presented in paper i.    figure 7 shows the time evolution of @xmath160 for different values of @xmath124 with fixed values of @xmath108 and @xmath128 .",
    "figure 8 also shows the time evolution of @xmath160 for different values for @xmath1 but with fixed values @xmath126 and @xmath128 .",
    "the energy decreasing time appears to be somewhat lesser when the driving frequency is higher .",
    "the @xmath162-folding time of dissipation for each parameter is listed in table 1 .",
    "it appears to have a weak correlation with the cloud size .",
    "the smallest @xmath162-folding times ( @xmath164 ) occur when the wave length @xmath136 is larger than the initial cloud size @xmath165 . in this case , most of the input energy escapes from the cloud without affecting it much .",
    "overall , our results show that @xmath166 is a good approximation for most clouds , i.e. , that @xmath167 does not depend very sensitively on most parameters .",
    "figure 9 shows the spatial power spectra of @xmath45 and @xmath43 for a model with @xmath128 , @xmath126 , and @xmath108 .",
    "both are plotted against the dimensionless quantity @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 is a length scale in the @xmath26-direction .",
    "the power spectra were taken at @xmath171 , in the midst of the period of steady turbulent driving , over the spatial range @xmath172 .",
    "there is a weak indication of a local peak in the power spectrum of @xmath45 around @xmath173 , which corresponds to the driving scale @xmath174 .",
    "however , the main result here is that there is significant power on scales larger than the driving scale ( @xmath175 ) in the spectra of both @xmath45 and @xmath43 .",
    "the dotted line shows the dependence @xmath176 for comparison ; it is the kolomogorov power spectrum for one - dimensional incompressible hydrodynamic motions ( e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "our simulations of compressible mhd motions shows both spectra are similar but have slightly steeper than @xmath176 slopes on small scales(@xmath177 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the same power spectra for the random perturbation model with @xmath178 , and @xmath108 .",
    "these power spectra confirm the basic result of the sinusoidal models that there is significant power on large scales ( @xmath179 ) and that the slopes are steeper than @xmath176 on small scales(@xmath177 ) .",
    "the power spectra show that there is significant power on the largest scales in the cloud and that the power spectrum naturally evolves to the form @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is a positive number , even if driving occurs within the cloud on a sub - cloud scale .",
    "this large - scale power comes from the wave propagation in the gravitationally stratified cloud .",
    "when a wave propagates into the low density region with greater alfvn  speed , the wavelength becomes larger .",
    "the waves of larger wavelengths also generally have less dissipation .",
    "these principles lead to significant power on larger scales in a gravitationally stratified cloud .",
    "figure 11 plots the time averaged velocity dispersions @xmath182 of lagrangian fluid elements within various model clouds as a function of @xmath183 , where @xmath184 + c_s^2},\\ ] ] and @xmath183 is the time - averaged height of each lagrangian fluid element .",
    "the open circles ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 in table 1 ) correspond to lagrangian fluid elements whose initial positions are located at @xmath187 , which is close to the edge of the cold cloud .",
    "the filled circles ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 in table 1 ) correspond to lagrangian fluid elements whose initial positions are located at @xmath190 , which is approximately the half - mass position of the cold cloud . an open and filled circle is plotted for each model in our complete parameter study ; some basic properties of each model are summarized in table 1 . the dotted line shows @xmath191 this figure shows that the model clouds are in a time - averaged self - gravitational equilibrium state under the influence of turbulent pressure ( see paper i ) .",
    "the varying parameters can affect the position of the circles , but all model clouds obey the basic correlation shown by the dotted line .",
    "this is consistent with the observational line - width  size relation of molecular clouds ( larson 1981 ; myers 1983 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "figure 12 shows the correlation between the velocity dispersion and mean alfvn velocity of the cloud @xmath11 at the mean position @xmath183 of the lagrangian elements .",
    "the mean alfvn velocity is defined by @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the mean density and @xmath93 is the column density for each lagrangian element .",
    "the dotted line shows @xmath194 results from model clouds with the same @xmath1 are circled and marked .",
    "they show that the velocity dispersions have a good correlation with the mean alfvn velocity if each cloud has a similar value of @xmath1 , i.e. mass - to - flux ratio .",
    "an analysis of the magnetic field measurements compiled by crutcher ( 1999 ) shows that there is an excellent correlation between the line - of - sight component of the large - scale magnetic field @xmath195 and @xmath196 for observed clouds of widely varying values of @xmath38 , @xmath195 , and @xmath21 ( basu 2000 ) .",
    "this is essentially the same correlation as equation ( [ eq : lwva ] ) ; the observational data actually imply an average value @xmath12 ( see basu 2005 for discussion ) .",
    "our models are consistent with this ratio if @xmath4 , i.e the mass - to - flux ratio is essentially equal to the critical value .",
    "a comparison of observed values of @xmath195 and column density also reveals that the mass - to - flux ratios are always very close to the critical value ( crutcher 1999 ; shu et al .",
    "1999 ; crutcher 2004 ; basu 2005 ) .",
    "we have performed 1.5-dimensional numerical simulations of nonlinear mhd waves in a gravitationally stratified molecular cloud that is bounded by a hot and tenuous external medium . using the same basic model",
    "as presented in paper i ( kudoh & basu 2003 ) , we have carried out a parameter survey by varying the frequency of the driving force and the magnetic field strength of the cloud .",
    "we found that the key parameter for the evolution of the cloud is the alfvn wavelength of the driving force .",
    "if the wavelength is larger than the size of the cloud , the cloud is affected less by the waves .",
    "the wavelength that is the same order of the cloud size is the most effective in expanding the cloud .",
    "this means that turbulent expansion is different than the usual notion of expansion due to a `` turbulent pressure '' in which the wavelengths need to be much smaller than the cloud size .",
    "we also studied the effect of a driving force that varies randomly with time and found that significant cloud expansion occurs since there is always a component of the driving that is at a favorable frequency for expanding the cloud .",
    "the evolution of our model clouds reveal the following general features : ( 1 ) under the influence of a driving source of alfvnic disturbances , a cloud shows significant upward and downward motions , with an oscillation time scale that is comparable to the cloud crossing time ; ( 2 ) after driving is discontinued , the turbulent energy dissipates exponentially with time , with an @xmath162-folding time essentially equal to the crossing time across the expanded cloud rather than the crossing time of the driving scale ; ( 3 ) the power spectra show that significant power is generated on scales larger than that of the turbulent driving ( @xmath179 ) ; ( 4 ) the line - width  size relation is obtained by an ensemble of clouds with different physical parameters which are individually in a time - averaged self - gravitational equilibrium state .",
    "the largest amplitude random motions occur in the outer low density regions of a stratified cloud .",
    "the magnetic field data is best fit by models with @xmath4 , which implies that the mass - to - flux ratio is very close to the critical value for collapse .    in the case of the random driving force ,",
    "we require a much larger driving amplitude @xmath123 than for the sinusoidal case in order to get a comparable expansion of the cloud ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this is due to the multiplication by a random number in the range @xmath197 $ ] at each time step ( see eq . [ [ eq : drivingr ] ] ) in the random case .",
    "the resulting driving efficiency is quite low since the driving force @xmath70 is often out of phase with @xmath43 , resulting in a lesser amount of work done in the random case than in the sinusoidal case for a given value of @xmath123 .",
    "a physically meaningful comparison of the energetics of the random and sinusoidal cases can be done by calculating the energy flux of alfvn  waves emerging from just outside the region of the artificial driving .",
    "we define the alfvn  energy flux in the @xmath26-direction to be @xmath198 and perform the calculation at @xmath199 .",
    "we find that the time - averaged energy flux of a random driving model with parameters @xmath150 and @xmath108 is comparable to ( actually about twice as large as ) that of a sinusoidal driving model with parameters @xmath128 , @xmath108 , and @xmath200 .    for the random driving case ( @xmath150 , @xmath108 ) , the time - averaged energy flux measured near the surface of the cloud ( at the full - mass position ) is about 20% of that at @xmath201 , so that about 80% of the input energy is dissipated in the cloud .",
    "for the sinusoidal driving case ( @xmath128 , @xmath108 , @xmath200 ) , the energy flux near the surface is about 30% of that at @xmath201 .",
    "the small difference may arise because the random model contains many high frequency waves which dissipate quickly . in each case , the dissipated energy flux measured while the driving term is applied is comparable to @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the steady - state value of the sum of fluctuating magnetic and kinetic energies during the turbulent driving phase , and @xmath167 is the dissipation time measured after turbulent driving is discontinued .",
    "our obtained value @xmath163 , which does not depend sensitively on most parameters , is somewhat longer than that estimated from three - dimensional periodic box simulations .",
    "we believe that part of the discrepancy comes from the generation of longer wavelength modes as the waves travel to low - density regions near the cloud s surface .",
    "however , one - dimensional simulations are also known to have lower dissipation rates than two- or three - dimensional ones ( ostriker et al .",
    "therefore , higher dimensional simulations that include density - stratification of the cloud will give the final answer in the future .",
    "in our ideal mhd model there is no wave damping due to ion - neutral friction , although there is wave damping due to a nonlinear cascade and nonlinear steepening , as well as leakage of wave energy into the external medium ( see paper i for a more extensive discussion ) .",
    "we expect that ion - neutral friction would be most effective at damping the shortest wavelength modes in our simulation ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 ) , and that the power spectra of @xmath45 and @xmath43 may become steeper at high wavenumber .",
    "however , our current results show that the wavelengths that are comparable to the initial cloud size are most effective at expanding the cloud , so it is not clear exactly how effective ion - neutral friction would be in removing turbulent cloud support .",
    "furthermore , we are modeling the large scale evolution of molecular clouds with mean column densities of up to a few times 10@xmath204 , or visual extinction @xmath205 . at these column densities ,",
    "the clouds are expected to be significantly ionized by background far - ultraviolet starlight so that ion - neutral friction will take a prohibitively long time ( mckee 1989 ) .",
    "our results show that the dense midplane of the cloud has transonic or subsonic motions , and we expect these regions to decouple from the more turbulent low density envelope and develop higher column density regions in which the far - ultraviolet background is shielded ( mckee 1989 ) . in these regions , the ionization fraction is significantly lesser , and ambipolar diffusion can enhance the process of core formation .",
    "therefore , models of fragmentation of a thin - layer which include the effects of magnetic fields and partial ionization due to cosmic rays ( basu & ciolek 2004 ) form a complementary approach to ours .",
    "our model has the advantage of being global by virtue of including the effect of cloud stratification and a cloud boundary , rather than being a local periodic box model .",
    "the 1.5-dimensional approximation has also allowed extremely high resolution which can more accurately track the propagation of mhd waves .",
    "our localized turbulent driving source is an artificial construct that mimics the various possible sources of disturbances in a real cloud .",
    "however , a general result is that the wave energy gets quickly redistributed throughout the cloud in such a way that most of the energy is on the largest scales .",
    "this result provides a way out of the `` luminosity problem '' posed by basu & murali ( 2001 ) , since the dissipation rate is then set by the crossing time of the cloud scale rather than that of the internal driving scale .",
    "our modeled clouds have a steady - state size @xmath206 pc and large - scale velocity dispersion @xmath207 , which makes them comparable to observed dark clouds which can form groupings known as the giant molecular clouds ( gmc s ; see e.g. , blitz & williams 1999 ) .",
    "the turbulent dissipation typically occurs with an @xmath162-folding time of a few myr and is completely dissipated by @xmath208 yr . even in the case",
    "that real molecular clouds and gmc s start their life in a turbulent state and then evolve with _ no _ further external turbulent input , our results show that the turbulent lifetime is less than but within reach of estimated gmc lifetimes , @xmath208 yr ; see discussion in larson ( 2003 ) . this provides another important motivation for future _ global _ three - dimensional models which can follow the actual sources of internal turbulent driving . as turbulence initially dissipates and a cloud contracts , we expect a transformation of some released gravitational potential energy back into mhd wave energy .",
    "in addition , much of the internal driving may be attributable to the outflows commonly launched from the near environs of protostars ( see e.g. , bachiller & tafalla 1999 ) ."
