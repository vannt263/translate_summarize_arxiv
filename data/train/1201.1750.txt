    "molecules can be assembled from atoms using laser light . this process is termed photoassociation . with the advent of femtosecond lasers and pulse shaping techniques ,",
    "photoassociation became a natural candidate for coherent control of a binary reaction .",
    "coherent control had been conceived as a method to determine the fate of chemical reactions using laser fields.@xcite the basic idea is to employ interference of matter waves to constructively enhance a desired outcome while destructively suppressing all undesired alternatives.@xcite control is exerted by shaping the laser pulses , the simplest control knobs being time delays and phase differences.@xcite over the last two decades , the field of coherent control has developed significantly both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite however , a critical examination of the achievements reveals that successful control has been demonstrated almost exclusively for unimolecular processes such as ionization , dissociation and fragmentation .",
    "it is natural to ask why the reverse process of controlling binary reactions@xcite is so much more difficult .",
    "the main difference between unimolecular processes and a binary reaction lies in the initial state  a single or few well - defined bound quantum states vs an incoherent continuum of scattering states.@xcite for a binary reaction , the nature of the scattering continuum is mainly determined by the temperature of the reactants . as temperature decreases ,",
    "higher partial waves are frozen out . at the very low temperatures of ultracold gases , the scattering energy of atom pairs is so low that the rotational barrier can not be passed , and the scattering becomes purely @xmath0-wave.@xcite in this regime , the reactants are pre - correlated due to quantum threshold effects@xcite and the effect of scattering resonances",
    "is particularly pronounced.@xcite at a temperature of about 100@xmath1k , photoassociation with femtosecond laser pulses has been demonstrated.@xcite coherent transient rabi oscillations were observed as the prominent feature in the pump - probe spectra .",
    "the transients are due to long tails of the pulses caused by a sharp spectral cut which is necessary to avoid excitation into unbound states.@xcite this pinpoints to the fact that the large spectral bandwidth of a femtosecond pulse is unsuitable to one - photon photoassociation at ultralow temperatures . in this regime",
    ", a narrow - band transition needs to be driven in order to avoid atomic excitation.@xcite    the situation changes completely for high temperatures where the scattering states can penetrate rotational barriers due to the large translational kinetic energy .",
    "the association process is then likely to happen at short internuclear distance close to the inner turning point and for highly excited rotational states . in this case , the large spectral bandwidth of femtosecond laser pulses is ideally adapted to both the broad thermal width of the ensemble of scattering states and the depth of the electronically excited state potential in which molecules are formed .",
    "the disadvantage of this setting is that the initial state is completely incoherent , impeding control of the photoreaction .",
    "photoassociation with femtosecond laser pulses was first demonstrated under these conditions , employing a one - photon transition in the uv.@xcite subsequent to the photoassociation , coherent rotational motion of the molecules was observed.@xcite we have recently demonstrated generation of both rotational and vibrational coherences by two - photon femtosecond photoassociation of hot atoms.@xcite this is a crucial step toward the coherent control of photoinduced binary reactions since the fate of bond making and breaking is determined by the vibrational motion .",
    "employing multi - photon transitions comes with several advantages : the class of molecules that can be photoassociated by near - ir / visible femtosecond laser pulses is significantly larger for multi - photon than one - photon excitation .",
    "femtosecond laser technology is most advanced in the near - ir spectral region . due to the different selection rules ,",
    "different electronic states become accessible for multi - photon transitions compared to one - photon excitation .",
    "control strategies differ for multi - photon and one - photon excitation .",
    "in particular , large dynamic stark shifts and an extended manifold of quantum pathways that can be interfered come into play for multi - photon excitation.@xcite the theoretical description needs to account for these strong - field effects .",
    "we have constructed a comprehensive theoretical model from first principles to describe the experiment in which magnesium atoms in a heated cell are photoassociated by femtosecond laser pulses.@xcite it is summarized in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "magnesium in its electronic ground state is a closed shell atom .",
    "its ground electronic potential , x@xmath2 , therefore displays only a weak van der waals attractive well . a femtosecond pulse of 100@xmath3fs transform - limited duration with a central wavelength of @xmath4 nm promotes an electron to the @xmath5 orbital .",
    "this two - photon transition is driven since a wavelength of 840@xmath3 nm is far from any one - photon resonance both for magnesium atoms and mg@xmath6 molecules , cf .",

    "a time - delayed femtosecond pulse probes the excited mg@xmath6 molecule by inducing a one - photon transition to a higher excited electronic state ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this state has a strong one - photon transition back to the ground state .",
    "the corresponding experimental observable is the intensity of the resulting uv fluorescence ( @xmath12 nm ) , measured as a function of the pump - probe time delay .",
    "an oscillating signal is a manifestation of coherent rovibrational dynamics in the @xmath13 state.@xcite    the correct description of the thermal initial state is crucial to capture the generation of coherence out of an incoherent ensemble .",
    "the density operator , @xmath14 , describing the initial state of hot atom pairs at temperature , @xmath15 , is constructed by a thermal average over suitable basis functions .",
    "since no dissipative processes occur on the sub - picosecond timescale of the experiment , the coherent time evolution of the density operator is efficiently carried out by propagating the basis functions .",
    "expectation values are obtained by thermally averaging the corresponding operator over the propagated basis functions .",
    "a numerically efficient description of the initial thermal ensemble is essential to facilitate the time - dependent simulations .",
