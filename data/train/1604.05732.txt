    "qt is a field which grows steadily and rapidly @xcite .",
    "qt brings the old realm of classical thermodynamics to a new perspective where quantum correlations and quantum coherence might play an important role . taking all this into account",
    ", it seems crucial to investigate the interaction of laser fields and trapped ions from a statistical nonequilibrium perspective , trying to uncover new aspects and physically relevant information previously untouched by standard approaches to this subject .",
    "the scenario is particularly rich given the multitude of different energy structures and transitions involving electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom accessible in this system through laser interaction @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for the present work is the possibility of studying thermodynamical implications of nonequivalent physical regimes , some of them driven by strongly nonlinear hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the physics of trapped ions and qt has been explored previously , for instance , in the context of ion - based thermo - engines @xcite and the verification of fluctuation relations @xcite .",

    ", we bring the variety of physical regimes available in the trapped ion system to the light of nonequilibrium qt .",
    "this includes carrier and sideband regimes , where single- or multiple - quanta transitions and energy dependent couplings manifest according to the laser frequency @xcite",
    ". we will be particularly interested in a study that addresses thermodynamic irreversibility as quantified by the irreversible lag @xcite produced by a finite - time transformation experienced by a trapped ion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ qt ] ,",
    "we briefly review the relevant concepts of nonequilibrium qt needed to the subsequent developments .",
    "this includes a discussion of the microscopic view of work and the basic physics upon which the nonequilibrium lag is built .",

    "a open system can exchange energy and/or particles with the environment or an external agent . in this context , work is energy which is transferred / extracted to / from the system through application of arbitrary generalized forces @xcite . from a microscopic perspective , work is then necessarily accompanied by a modification of the system hamiltonian ( energy levels ) .",
    "this is to be distinguished from heat which is energy exchanged with the environment through their mutual weak ( infinitesimal ) interaction .",

    "the idea is that a backwards run of the work protocol after the system starts attempting thermal reequilibration will not , in general , bring the system and environment to their initial state .",
    "the quantity between the parentheses is known as irreversible work @xcite , and @xmath16 is usually called `` nonequilibrium lag '' ( nl ) as it gives an idea of how the system state , after the work protocol , lags behind an equilibrium thermal state fixed by the final hamiltonian and inverse temperature @xmath17 .",

    "this finite behavior is illustrated with the case @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig5l5 ] .",
    "other choices of @xmath42 will lead to conclusions alike since the asymptotic behavior of @xmath115 with @xmath5 and @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath42 in any fundamental way @xcite .",
    "to finish the analysis of the nl , we explore its behavior for higher sidebands ( @xmath156 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6l6 ] , we present a numerical study of such a dependence .",
    "one can see that the jc case tends to reversibility as the number of excitations @xmath42 exchanged between the ion motion and the electronic levels , induced by the laser , increases . for the ajc case , once again a rich behavior is found . for small @xmath31 ,",
    "the nl monotonically decreases with @xmath42 , while for higher values of @xmath31 , it comes to a point where the behavior is not monotonic anymore as highlighted in the inset of the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig6l6 ] . from this point , we varied @xmath31 up to @xmath157 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1l1 ] ) to verify that , in this range , the maximum displaces to higher values of @xmath42 as @xmath31 increases .",
    "the same kind of analysis was performed considering the variation of @xmath42 for different temperatures and rabi frequencies , and contrary to results in fig .",
    "[ fig6l6 ] , there are no remarkable differences between the ajc and jc cases .    as a final remark , it is worthwhile to notice that , except for fig",
    ".  [ fig4l4 ] , which is a theoretical extrapolation of the current experimental parameters , we have always found a higher nl for the ajc than for the jc .",
    "this can be once again understood from the relatively small values of @xmath86 used in the simulations , and from the fact that the nl is a relative entropy .",
    "this is the same reasoning we employed in the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig3l3 ] .",
    "additionally , the first order expansion of the hyperbolic function ( in powers of @xmath158 ) in eq .",
    "( [ partf1 ] ) shows immediately that @xmath159 .",
    "from the point of view of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , we studied the problem of sudden driving of a trapped ion by a classical laser field .",
    "this thermodynamical analysis was instrumental to pinpoint fundamental differences between the jaynes - cummings and anti - jaynes - cummings - type hamiltonians that arise in the trapped ion system by careful choice of the laser frequency . the role played by the magnitude of the lamb - dicke parameter , related to nonlinearity , and other physically relevant parameters",
    "was carefully studied .",
    "this makes our work useful also to the experimentalist who might be interested in the practical investigation of quantum thermodynamics of laser - manipulated trapped ion systems . in this respect ,",
    "our work is , to the best of our knowledge , the first one to includes , in a thermodynamical approach , the great variety of possible electronic - vibration interactions available in the trapped ion system .",
    "taking into account the small values of the nl encountered when using up - to - date experimental parameters , noise in the experimental setup might impair its practical determination .",
    "one way to circumvent that is to increase the rabi frequency ( intensity of the laser ) , since the nl increases monotonically with this parameter . to be more quantitative ,",
    "a change of @xmath27 from @xmath160 to @xmath161 is enough to increase the nl two orders of magnitude .",
    "an experimental assessment of the findings of this paper might make use of a 2d trap ( ion oscillations along @xmath162 and @xmath163 directions ) and a driving laser coupling the electronic degrees of freedom to the @xmath162 motion .",
    "this can be easily achieved by choosing the right direction of the laser wave vector .",
    "the @xmath163 motion is used then as an ancilla in the interferometric scheme presented in @xcite . for that , an extra laser is to be used to couple the system ( electronic levels plus @xmath162 motion ) to the ancilla in order to arrange for a proper gate entangling them @xcite . with these",
    ", the work distribution can be experimentally determined and , with the help of the jarzynski equality @xcite , the free energy and consequently the nl can be obtained .",

    "<S> we show that in these multiquantum or sideband regimes , variation of the lamb - dicke parameter causes a non - monotonic behavior of the irreversibility indicator . </S>",
    "<S> counterintuitively , we find a working point where nonlinearity helps reversibility , making the sudden quench of the hamiltonian closer to what would have been obtained quasistatically and isothermally . </S>"
