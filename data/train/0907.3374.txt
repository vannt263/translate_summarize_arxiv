    "our approach is based on the fact that the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry provides the basic dynamics for the evaluation of soft matrix element involving the goldstone bosons ( pion , kaons ) and gauge currents ( photons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) . that way one may evaluate in a genuinely dynamical way the soft quantities appearing in high - energy processes .",
    "a detailed presentation of the method and the compilation of predictions for the pion matrix elements can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient of the method is the qcd evolution from the a priori unknown _ quark model scale _ to the scales relevant for the experiments of lattice calculations .",
    "thus the scheme consists of two steps : 1 )  the evaluation of soft matrix elements in the chiral quark model and 2 )  the qcd evolution to a higher scale .",
    "the quark model scale may be estimated with the help of the momentum sum rule @xcite , and is found to be low , @xmath2  mev ( for the local chiral quark models ) . after the qcd evolution , a successful description of the available data for the pion is achieved for the parton distribution function ( pdf ) and the distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "there are numerous quark - model studies of these quantities as well as the more general pion generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) in the literature . a related quantity ,",
    "the pion - photon transition distribution amplitude ( tda ) @xcite has also been evaluated in this framework  @xcite .    the hadronic part of the photon wave - function consist , in the large-@xmath3 limit , of the quark - antiquark pair . since the chiral dynamics provides the quarks a large ( constituent ) mass , it influences the photon dynamics . here",
    "we apply the methods developed and tested earlier for the pion to the photon case .",
