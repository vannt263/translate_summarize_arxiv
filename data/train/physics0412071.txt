    "the very first laser  maiman s ruby in 1961  produced extremely unstable emission , as evidenced by a figure in the original publication @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter , researchers began to learn the skills of how to avoid instabilities in lasers designed for applications .",
    "nonetheless laser instabilities have been around ever since both as a nuisance lurking to haunt technically - minded people , and as an interesting nontrivial physical phenomenon for the more fundamental - principles - minded set .",
    "after all , lasers are nonlinear dynamical feedback systems , and instabilities are inherent in such systems .",
    "it is certainly warranted to gain an understanding of laser instabilities  if only for the minimalist purpose that they be avoided successfully in spite of the ever increasing demands on lasers in terms of power , speed , tunability , etc .    in lasers , typically one or several modes of the light field are subject to resonator boundary conditions while at the same time being dynamically coupled to the amplifying medium .",
    "typically the coupling is highly nonlinear , and depending on the laser type and particular circumstances , the laser may behave in many different ways , running the gamut from smooth and stable single - mode to irregular and unpredictable chaotic operation .    to systematically address the plethora of possibilities ,",
    "one can make a first distinction between cases in which either several transverse modes are involved , or just a single one ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "next - neighbor longitudinal modes always have very nearly the same frequency difference , and only a single beat frequency , along with its overtones , can occur .",
    "in contrast , for transverse modes there can be more beat frequencies , giving rise to an enormous wealth of possibilities for frequency locking and pulling phenomena .",
    "maiman s ruby laser , for example , displayed an instability that involved several transverse modes .",
    "the complexity of the situation is not helped by the fact that a mathematical description requires either an infinite set of ordinary differential equations , or a set of fully space - dependent partial differential equations .",
    "nonetheless , quite some research was devoted to multi - transverse mode dynamics ( see @xcite for references , and the rest of articles appearing in the present volume ) .",
    "more attention , however , was given to single mode laser instabilities over the last three decades .",
    "overviews and references can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .    here",
    "we shall consider single  transverse mode problems . in this context",
    ", there is an important distinction whether several longitudinal cavity modes are involved in the lasing process , or just a single one , although a connection between singlemode and multimode instabilities can be established @xcite .",
    "it is also of fundamental importance whether the gain medium exhibits a homogeneously or inhomogeneously broadened lasing transition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was noticed by haken in 1975 @xcite that the maxwell - bloch model for a homogeneously broadened single mode laser is isomorphic to the lorenz model of chaos , originally developed for climatic instability @xcite .",
    "this directly implies that these lasers must exhibit a second threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ a characteristic value of the pump power above which a lorenz - type instability sets on .",
    "one can show that this second threshold is at least nine times higher than the first ( ordinary ) threshold above which there is coherent oscillation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this factor  of  nineis of great importance to the present paper .",
    "later weiss found @xcite that certain far - infrared lasers have suitable damping rates and can be pumped hard enough to test this prediction .",
    "indeed they displayed chaotic behavior remarkably similar in many respects to that exhibited by the lorenz model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the level structure of the gain atoms was much more complex than a two - level system .",
    "the relevance of this difference for the laser dynamics was the focus of some controversy during the eighties and the beginning of the nineties ( see @xcite for a discussion at depth and for references ) .",
    "however , in the absence of a formal proof of equivalence between the realistic laser model and the lorenz model , one can only cautiously conclude that some lasers can display lorenz chaos even when their structure does not make it obvious that the lorenz equations are the appropriate model .",
    "in contrast , multilongitudinal mode laser emission has received only marginal attention from the viewpoint of laser instabilities .",
    "this is all the more remarkable considering that most lasers emit in several longitudinal modes , if only due to spectral hole burning in inhomogeneously broadened active media ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a common belief that with a homogenously broadened gain line and single - transverse mode condition , the only way to have more than one longitudinal mode oscillating is spatial inhomogeneity in the medium , such as the spatial hole burning occurring in linear resonators .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity provides the required amount of independence of the inversion available to one mode from that available to another mode so that the usual winner - takes - all coupling is suspended in favor of the mild mutual coupling due the finite overall energy balance .",
    "this myth was shattered when in 1968 two publications , independent of each other , discussed the situation in detail @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that even in a unidirectional resonator filled with a perfectly homogeneous medium , rabi splitting of the lasing transition induced by the lasing mode can provide gain for other longitudinal modes .",
    "this means that even perfect gain homogeneity does not safeguard against instability .",
    "while a string of four names makes a somewhat awkward moniker , fairness dictates to call this mechanism the _ risken - nummedal - graham - haken instability _ , or rnghi for short .",
    "_ introduced the term _ resonant rabi instability _ for designating this instability @xcite .",
    "is not fixed as it depends on the velocity of the travelling  wave solution .",
    "this would be extended further to cover detuning in 1990 when ning and haken @xcite showed that the detuned multimode laser equations are isomorphic to the complex lorenz model for the baroclinic instability @xcite .",
    "this isomorphism is a powerful tool that has not been investigated enough , specially for what concerns the multimode instability . ]    in @xcite a unidirectional ring cavity with small cavity losses filled with a homogeneously broadened two  level active medium was assumed .",
    "the prediction was that for rnghi to occur the pump power must exceed a certain instability threshold .",
    "this instability threshold is referred to as the _ second threshold _ , in distinction to the familiar first threshold which defines the onset of coherent laser oscillation .",
    "the value of the second threshold came out to be at least nine times the lasing threshold ( the same `` factor  of ",
    "nine''as in single ",
    "mode instabilities in the lorenz  haken model ) .",
    "another condition was that the laser cavity length must exceed a certain minimum .",
    "indeed , it has to be unrealistically long for conventional bulk lasers @xcite .    due to these predictions and without experimental demonstration of the opposite , interest in rnghi abated over time : while during the seventies and eighties much theoretical effort was devoted to the understanding of the rnghi as well as to the dynamics of the laser above the second threshold @xcite , eventually rnghi was more or less dismissed as a merely academical prediction rather than an actual mechanism for multimode emission .    in 1984",
    "researchers announced that they had observed what could be interpreted as rnghi in a dye laser @xcite .",
    "the dye laser seemed to be a good candidate for the observation of the rnghi as ( i ) it is a homogeneously broadened laser , and ( ii ) the criticalcavity length ( see later for a precise definition of this term ) is smaller than typical resonator lengths @xcite .",
    "however , it was peculiar that in the spectrum there where only two peaks instead of three . finally , after some debate @xcite , fu and haken showed that a suitable model for the dye ( consisting of bands rather than levels ) could explain the observations without invoking the rnghi @xcite . from then on the observation in @xcite was no longer considered as a manifestation of the rnghi .",
    "a few years later , a phenomenon very similar to rnghi was discussed in the context of optical bistability performed in the microwave regime @xcite .",
    "the experimental system consisted of a waveguide fabry ",
    "perot cavity with a length of 182  m filled with hydrocyanic acid vapor at low ( @xmath1 ) pressure .",
    "driven at a frequency of 86  ghz near a hc@xmath2n transition , this system displayed bistability and , on the upper branch of the bistable loop , self - oscillation at a frequency of the order of the cavity free spectral range and of the rabi frequency , but could deviate by 50% or so .",
    "nevertheless it is to be emphasized that this fairly unique experiment actually displayed not the rnghi , but the multimode instability of optical bistability predicted in 1978 by bonifacio and lugiato @xcite .",
    "thus , for many years and after a false start , the closest thing to the rngh laser instability that was actually observed was rabi splitting in microwave optical bistability  not very close , certainly .",
    "the discussion on the rnghi during the late eighties and the nineties faded , although theoretical studies continued @xcite , and signatures of the rnghi were predicted also for laser related systems such as a laser with an intracavity parametric amplifier @xcite , and a laser with injected signal @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in this period it seemed like the matter of longitudinal mode instabilities in lasers , and the rnghi in particular , would soon be more or less forgotten .",
    "the situation changed with a suggestion by lugiato and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they observed that a ring ",
    "cavity erbium  doped fibre laser ( edfl )",
    "spontaneously mode - locked and emitted a train of pulses with a repetition time equal to the cavity roundtrip time .",
    "this is one signature of the rnghi , but certainly not in itself a sufficient criterion .",
    "however , the unusually long cavity length of fibre lasers automatically fulfils the most difficult prerequisite for rnghi of sufficient resonator length . on this basis",
    "they put forward the hypothesis that self  pulsing in these lasers could be a manifestation of the rnghi ( see also @xcite for compatible experimental results ) .",
    "unfortunately they could not confirm the existence of a second laser threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ a threshold - like onset of the instability .",
    "moreover , there was a grave quantitative difficulty : instabilities were observed at pump powers immediately above the lasing threshold @xcite , in stark contrast to the prediction that the second threshold be at least nine times higher than the first .",
    "it was subsequently shown that this requirement is not necessarily applicable to real - world lasers . in @xcite the usual two - level atom model for lorenz - type instability was extended to incorporate a third level as a necessity for applying a pump source .",
    "it turned out that the instability threshold was lowered such as to come close to the lasing threshold .",
    "this finding was then applied to edfls @xcite .",
    "erbium ions , too , behave more like three  level systems @xcite , rather than two  level systems as the original theory assumed .",
    "now the ratio of the instability to the laser threshold was predicted to be close to unity .",
    "this was subsequently corroborated ( and expanded to include four - level cases ) in @xcite .    put simply ,",
    "for edfls the expected factor  of  nine , became a factor ",
    "of(@xmath3 ) . thereby , the apparent contradiction with the hypothesis in @xcite is gone .",
    "this insight bestowed fresh vigor on the debate on rnghi and lead to dedicated experimental investigation as will be described below .    in this paper",
    "we shall review the fundamentals of the rngh theory as well as the research we have carried out along the recent years ( including some inedit results ) , i.e. , we shall not review in detail the available literature .",
    "after this historical introduction , the paper follows with three more sections .",

    "the last item allows to determine which is the value of the cavity length beyond which the rate equations approach is no more valid . by analyzing eqs .",
    "( [ khanin - thres ] ) and ( [ mbthres ] ) one obtains that the distance between the two functions is minimum for @xmath683 when @xmath684 .",
    "this leads to a coherence lengthestimate @xmath685for lasers with a significant inhomogeneous broadening ( @xmath686 ) .",
    "then , for cavities larger than @xmath687 , atomic coherence effects ( _ i.e. _ , rabi  splitting induced gain ) are important for the determination of the multimode emission threshold while they are irrelevant for shorter cavities . for example , for co@xmath688 lasers @xmath689 m , for @xmath690 nm hene lasers @xmath691 m , for er@xmath692doped fibre lasers @xmath693 cm , and for nd  glass lasers @xmath694 mm .",

    "this marks an important difference with the case of homogeneous broadening .",
    "the fact that this qualitative change appears at @xmath706 can be related to the fact that the rate equations model predicts the multimode instability only for @xmath668 .",
    "this result suggests that for @xmath668 spectral hole burning makes multimode emission possible when the rabi  induced gain mechanism could not do it by itself ( _ i.e. _ , there is no more a @xmath461 , which is a characteristic of the rnghi ) , while for @xmath669 , @xmath461 exists ( although its values decreases for increasing @xmath630 ) .",

    "in this section we describe experimental observations that contribute to the discussion of multimode laser instabilities . we already discussed in sect .",
    "[ introduction ] that experimental research on the rnghi has been limited to the dye laser @xcite and that the observed multimode emission was explained as being caused by the band structure of the lasing levels @xcite , not a manifestation of the rnghi .",
    "prior to refs .  @xcite",
    "no other experimental work on the subject has appeared .",
    "the reason is probably that the constraints imposed on the cavity length by eqs .",
    "( [ ac ] ) and ( [ lcmin ] ) have discouraged experimentalists : according to eq .",
    "( [ lcmin ] ) , cavity lengths need to be enormously long ( in some cases several orders of magnitude longer than standard values ) , while at the same time there is the requirement of a very large instability to lasing threshold ratio ( the factor  of  nine ) @xcite .",
    "by now it is known , however , that the factor  of  nine  is irrelevant if the active medium is better modelled as a three  level laser medium . moreover , for such lasers eq .",
    "( [ lcmin ] ) does not constitute a hard limit , as for cavity lengths well below this value instabilities occur at accessible pump values .",
    "this makes it much more likely that the rnghi becomes observable in some lasers .    by this reasoning ,",
    "er - doped fiber lasers are rendered the most promising candidate for a clear observation of the rnghi : these are three  level lasers , and their cavities can be made very long . we will therefore concentrate on this laser type .",
    "many laser applications require monochromatic operation , and therefore several researchers attempted to operate er - doped fiber laser in single mode operation .",
    "however , after many failures and a few partial successes , this is now considered as notoriously difficult . where it was attempted , researchers chose one of these strategies : ( i ) increase the cavity s effective free spectral range beyond the gain bandwidth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or ( ii ) reduce the gain bandwidth below the free spectral range by insertion of filters with very narrow bandwidth ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "none of these approaches led to a full success .",
    "for example , in a publication subsequent to @xcite it is reported that single mode operation became impossible to maintain above a certain pump level @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior was not further investigated .",
    "the pragmatic conclusion is that edfl s obviously have a natural tendency to operate on several modes simultaneously .",
    "the small free spectral range caused by the necessarily long resonator contributes to the difficulty , but by itself can not explain the underlying reason .",
    "probably the first experimental study of fundamental causes for the instability of an edfl was presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors made a distinction between relaxation oscillation and self mode locking , and investigated the latter .",
    "they used a resonator consisting of a wdm coupler to bring in the pump light , and an output coupler to steer fully 90% of the power out .",
    "a polarization - insensitive optical isolator enforced unidirectional operation .",
    "an er - doped active fiber provided gain ; alternatively either a 15  m length at low dopant concentration ( 300  ppm ) , or a 0.8  m length at high concentration ( @xmath7115000  ppm ) was used . allowing for some extra length of component pigtails , this brought the resonator s free spectral range to about 10  mhz or 70  mhz , respectively .",
    "the laser output was directed through another isolator and then monitored either by a fast photodiode hooked up to a fast oscilloscope or an rf spectrum analyzer , or by a background - free autocorrelator .",
    "no stable cw emission was observed . for the longer cavity",
    "it was reported that self - modelocking produced a train of pulses with a repetition rate given by the resonator s free spectral range .",
    "an occasional presence of satellite pulses at intermediate times was mentioned .",
    "the pulses were reported to have a temporal width ( fwhm ) of a few ns .",
    "inspection with the autocorrelator was performed to check for substructure .",
    "the autocorrelator could monitor a time window of 50  ps , and within this window no substructure was found . for the shorter cavity , a modulation of the output power at the free spectral range was also observed .",
    "however , it did not take the form of pulses but rather had a nearly sinusoidal shape .",
    "this is plausible because for a larger free spectral range , fewer modes will fall into the bandwidth of the gain .",
    "when the pump power was varied near lasing threshold , in the shorter cavity the instability was seen whenever there was lasing , while in the longer cavity a small interval of single - mode operation seemed to exist just above lasing threshold .      in a subsequent study @xcite , basically the same group of authors replaced the polarization - insensitive isolator with a polarizing isolator .",
    "they also added polarization controllers to the cavity .",
    "two output couplers branching out 95% or 50% were used alternatively .",
    "the active fiber was again of the low er concentration type , and was 13  m long .",
    "the cavity free spectral range was thus near 10  mhz .",
    "again , self mode locking at the cavity free spectral range was observed ; pulses had a duration of 1.74  3.00  ns .",
    "the rf spectrum contained @xmath712 beat notes , indicative of a similar number of oscillating modes .    in this experiment",
    "there was a combination of fiber birefringence plus polarizing elements in the cavity .",
    "this raises the issue whether mode locking due to nonlinear polarization rotation ( npr ) might have occurred .",
    "the authors argue that npr can be ruled out for the following reasons : ( i ) in the previous setup , there definitely was no picosecond structure , and when the polarizing isolator was introduced , the pulse shape was not modified .",
    "this suggests  somewhat indirectly  that the polarizing action is not responsible .",
    "the authors further noted that ( ii ) at times intermediate to the pulses there was a constant background of random signal , possibly satellite pulses of some kind , and that npr would likely suppress such structure .",
    "however , random groups of pulses are routinely seen in npr lasers .",
    "finally , ( iii ) power levels in the fiber were deemed insufficient for npr , in particular since a wide core fiber was used .",
    "npr requires remarkably little power , however , and at the powers stated , npr can not be ruled out entirely .",
    "however , the authors kindly inform us that the instability also existed just above threshold , and in that case npr is indeed highly unlikely to occur .",
    "there remains an unresolved discrepancy about the measured spectral shape of the pulses which is reported to be gaussian and , for 2  ns pulses , must have been 0,001  nm wide .",
    "the optical spectrum analyzer reportedly used for this measurement , however , has a specified spectral resolution of 0,05  nm .",
    "one of the most prominent features of rnghi , namely its threshold - like onset , was not addressed in the experiment of @xcite .",
    "the publication provides a comment that the experiments took place far above lasing thresholds , but that instability persisted down to at least a less - than - tenfold threshold power .",
    "as the authors kindly inform us , the instability was seen immediately above lasing threshold . from this information",
    "one must conclude that the matter deserves more clarification before anything is definitely proven .",
    "in subsequent work , an er - doped fiber ring laser specifically designed for observation of instabilities was set up by some of the present authors . as a starting point",
    "a standard configuration was chosen , see fig .",
    "[ fig:16 ] .",
    "the cavity contained @xmath713 of active fiber ( 585  ppm er dopant level ) in a @xmath714 long ring ( the remainder consisted of standard single mode fiber ) .",
    "pump light came from a @xmath715 , @xmath716 laser diode ; it was launched into the ring by a wdm coupler .",
    "light coupled out by this wdm coupler , and also from an additional 95/5 coupler , was used to monitor the system simultaneously by a fast photodiode and an optical spectrum analyzer .",
    "an optical isolator ensured unidirectional operation , and a moderately narrow bandpass filter gently restricted the bandwidth available for lasing to about @xmath717 . as a unique feature , variable loss was inserted into the cavity . to this end",
    "either an amplitude modulator or a tight fiber coil with well  defined radius was employed .",
    "high variable loss served to bring out the onset of instability more clearly .",
    "great effort was made to characterize the exact amount of loss for each setting : all components ( localized losses ) including splices etc .",
    "were tested individually , and the distributed loss in the er fiber was determined . finally , as a cross - check the total loss was calculated from the operational laser s output power vs. pump power relation . for more detail",
    "see @xcite .    just above lasing threshold",
    "this laser indeed operated in a single longitudinal mode .",
    "as the pump power was increased , modulations of the output power appeared at frequencies which were integer multiples of the cavity round trip frequency ( @xmath718 ) without exception .",
    "obviously these were beat notes between different longitudinal modes .",
    "these beat notes , however , were neither steady in amplitude , nor in frequency : the frequencies involved hopped rapidly and apparently at random all across the range up to several ghz , and during much of the time in between there was no beat at all .",
    "after the insertion of the bandpass filter already mentioned above , the frequency hopping range was limited to hundreds of mhz and thus more manageable .",
    "still , the beats remained unsteady . a typical beat note episode lasted on the order of tens of milliseconds to a few seconds .",
    "the temporal profile of the beat note was almost always very nearly sinusoidal , indicative of a beat between only two resonator modes . in the presence of the high loss intentionally introduced here",
    ", the laser could not be pumped very far above threshold , so that it may be not too surprising that there was just dual  mode , but no multimode operation .",
    "we wish to point out that for this experiment nonlinear polarization rotation ( npr ) @xcite can be safely ruled out .",
    "polarization - dependent losses , on which npr hinges , were carefully avoided .    given a random phenomenon ,",
    "statistical means were employed to characterize it .",
    "time series of the instantaneous power were recorded which  in view of the typical timescales  were chosen to be several seconds long .",
    "unfortunately , adequate sampling to correctly assess all up to the highest frequencies would have required data rates of gb / s and file sizes of about 10 gb per shot ; that is just not feasible . to keep data files at manageable size , undersampling at 20  000 samples per second was chosen . while this way information about the actual beat frequency is lost , all episodes of mode beating longer than @xmath719 still can be detected from the time series .",
    "shorter episodes seemed not to occur anyway .",
    "occasional occurrences of relaxation oscillation were easily identified in the file by their very different amplitude , and were discarded .",
    "the fraction of time during which valid mode beats were detected served as the measure of instability @xmath720 .    the data - taking procedure consisted in setting a particular loss value , then incrementing the pump power in small steps , and determining @xmath720 at each step .",
    "( at the same time , as described above , the total power was recorded to help assess the loss value ) .",
    "next , the loss was incremented , and the procedure was repeated until the accessible range of loss values was exhausted .",
    "after an evaluation of these extensive data , the following conclusions are reached : the laser power data in fig .",
    "[ fig:17 ] show the universally known threshold behavior : the power is close to zero below threshold , but not exactly so due to fluorescence . above threshold",
    "the power makes a good fit to a straight line by which the slope efficiency is defined .",
    "the measure of instability , on the other hand , strictly remains at zero up to some point above the laser threshold . beyond that point , @xmath720 sharply sets on to nonzero values , and continues to rise as the pump power is raised further .",
    "this is clear evidence that the instability has a well - defined , sharp onset , a fact which had not previously been demonstrated experimentally .    in the next step both the lasing threshold and the instability onset",
    "are taken from data as in fig .",
    "[ fig:17 ] .",
    "[ fig:18 ] reveals that the ratio of both values @xmath721 ( where @xmath722and @xmath723 denote the pump power at the instability and lasing thresholds , respectively ) does indeed scale with loss . at low loss , @xmath724 . under typical operating conditions of er fiber lasers",
    ", losses would be even lower , and experimenters would be unable to tell apart both onsets . for larger loss",
    ", however , @xmath725 increases up to about @xmath726 .",
    "the intentionally high loss of this experiment pays off nicely here : both onsets are clearly distinguishable , and the interval of single mode operation in between is clearly identifiable .",
    "this constitutes a considerable progress over previous work .",
    "however , we must emphasize an important fact regarding the range of loss values used in that experiment .",

    "[ d(r ) ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] ) ; hence the corresponding maximum loss diverges .",
    "it is difficult to make precise statements about the value of @xmath630 for the fiber used in the experiment in @xcite , but a choice of @xmath697 is reasonable . for this value , fig .",
    "[ fig:19 ] shows the theoretically expected threshold ratio as a function of localized cavity loss ( the calculation takes distributed losses into account , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "evidently , the disagreement with experimental data is reduced dramatically . while quantitatively @xmath103",
    "is systematically predicted too high , in particular at the highest loss values , at least the discrepancy about the _ existence _ of an instability onset is resolved .",
    "finally we need to address a caveat about the interpretation of the experimentally observed instability onset . as was discussed in secs .",
    "[ homo - nufl - pulse],[homo - nufl - sub ] , the possibility exists that the instability threshold is either a supercritical or a subcritical bifurcation . based on experimental data alone",

    "[ fig:15 ] ) .",
    "the observed intermittent behavior would make some sense in that case : the experimentally determined instability onset would then be the lower limit point of the unstable branch , and the bifurcation proper was never reached due to limited available pump power .",
    "in fact , not even the point of maxwell s construction(where both branches are occupied for equal amounts of time on average ) was reached . even if unlimited pump power had been available , it is not at all clear whether a final conclusion about the nature of the bifurcation could have been reached , because a sizeable increase of the pump power eventually brings on other processes like brillouin scattering , thermal effects , etc . , which further complicate the issue .",
    "we must therefore leave this question open for now .",
    "let as finally remark that , in contrast to @xcite , _ _ multi__mode operation and pulsing was never observed in @xcite : there was only dual  mode operation and sinusoidal modulation .",

    "surely , this must have to do with the fact that the laser was intentionally made lossy so that it could never be pumped very much above its first threshold .",
    "whether there are still other factors involved ( codopants of the fiber , etc . ) must remain unresolved at this point .",
    "we have introduced the different models required for the study of the rnghi . in particular , we have treated the applicability of the two  level laser model to three and four  level lasers and , importantly , the rigorous derivation of the uniform field limit .",
    "we have then revised the basics of the rnghi , and we have reviewed our continued work on the subject over recent years .",
    "this research was motivated by the suggestion by lugiato and coworkers in 1997 @xcite that the pulsations exhibited by a unidirectional edfl could be a manifestation of this elusive phenomenon .    at long last ,",
    "the threshold - like onset of the multimode instability in an edfl was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "data show a qualitative and , with appropriate corrections , even semi - quantitative agreement to theoretical expectations .",
    "nevertheless , data do not represent a clear - cut textbook rendition of the rnghi , but only an approximation .",
    "therefore the bottom line of our combined theoretical and experimental research is this : the processes observed in edfls very likely constitute a manifestation of the rnghi , but it is a manifestation in a dressed way .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening , distributed losses , and the three  level structure of erbium ions take their imprint on the instability .",
    "moreover , it is very likely that noise plays a central role in the intermittent appearance of multimode emission .",
    "theories are very often neater and much more elegant than real  world experiments .",
    "the closest thing to lorenz - type laser chaos that was ever found experimentally suffered from complications that are absent from the model , as we commented in sect . [ introduction ] . in a similar way",
    ", the experiment in @xcite presents the closest thing to rnghi that has been found to date . in any case",
    ", we do not have any doubt that the experimental observations are a clear manifestation of the resonant rabi instability , i.e. , that rabi sideband gain is the responsible for the observed instability .",
    "another remarkable result of our research is that the rngh mechanism is essential for understanding the multimode emission threshold in inhomogeneously broadened lasers , even for relatively short values of the laser cavity depending on the active medium .",
    "this fact suggests that rnghi could be important for correctly understanding mode  locking in lasers with an accessible coherence length ( see eq .",
    "( [ lcoh ] ) and the subsequent discussion ) .",
    "finally we would like to remark that there are open questions from both the theoretical and the experimental sides .",
    "on the one hand , the observed intermittent pulsations needs to be theoretically explained , and it must be determined up to what extent subcriticality and noise could explain them , or wether other phenomena we have not yet considered ( such as dispersion or fiber nonlinearity @xcite ) need to be taken into account . on the other hand , experimental research in other laser types , as nddfls or nd : yag lasers , would help to understand how the rngh mechanism affects real lasers .",
