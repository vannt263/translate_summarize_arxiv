    ", a unitary transformation of any number of entangled qubits can be constructed from logic gates that operate on only two qubits at a time @xcite , a result that has no analog in classical reversible logic where three - bit gates are needed to simulate all reversible boolean functions @xcite .",

    "this offers greater flexibility in the storage and processing of quantum information , and more importantly , provides an alternate route to the scaling up of quantum computation .    as in the binary case ,",
    "a tensor product of many such qudits is essential for the efficient storage of information , since the number of dimensions in the hilbert space scales exponentially with the number of qudits in the system . allowing @xmath0 to be arbitrary enables a trade - off between the number of qudits making up the quantum computer and the number of levels in each qudit .",
    "for example , the linear ion trap quantum computer @xcite uses only two levels in each ion for computing , although additional levels can be accessed , and are typically needed , for processing and reading out the state of the ion @xcite . by using @xmath0 computational levels in each ion ,",
    "we reduce the number of ions needed for a computation in this scheme by a factor of @xmath4 , since the hilbert space of @xmath5 qudits has the same dimensionality as @xmath6 qubits , namely @xmath7 . given the difficulty of trapping and coherently manipulating a large number of ions in their vibrational ground state in this scheme , a reduction in the number of ions offered by a multi - valued memory is an advantage .",
    "a tensor product of qudits is also essential for the efficient processing of quantum information . as in the binary case ,",
    "we build unitary transforms on the whole system from logic gates that operate within and between qudits , creating entangled superpositions , rather than by transforming subsets of a non - entangled , unary hilbert space .",
    "these elementary multi - valued gates are necessarily more complex than their binary counterparts , involving a controlled transformation of all the levels of each qudit . however , a logical network of these gates becomes simpler at this expense , invoking a trade - off between the complexity of each gate and the number of gates needed for a computation @xcite .",
    "we implement a multi - level gate in the linear ion trap scheme by using multiple lasers to address the different transitions in each ion simultaneously . in this approach , each multi - level gate takes less time to implement than the equivalent binary gate sequence on two - level systems , enabling larger computations within the decoherence time .    quantum computing in multi - level systems",
    "is ideally described using a multi - valued basis for logic .",
    "the information stored in a @xmath3-level quantum system is fundamentally non - binary in character , since a measurement collapses the system to one of these @xmath0 levels , specifying a single value for the qudit , rather than the @xmath4 values characteristic of a binary representation of the same hilbert space .",
    "moreover , as the @xmath0 levels in a single qudit need not contain any entanglement , two - bit conditional logic among these levels is not well - defined , and can not simulate multi - level unitary transforms in practice .",
    "by contrast , the entanglement between two different @xmath3-level systems enables conditional two - qudit logic gates , which we show to be the elementary operations of multi - valued quantum computing .",

    "in the following two sections , we derive a set of one- and two - qudit gates that are sufficient for universal multi - valued computing , and show that these can be implemented using multi - level ions in the linear ion trap model .",
    "we review the gates that are universal for binary quantum logic in a way that facilitates their multi - valued generalization .",
    "the universal binary gates belong to a family of unitary transforms described by three parameters @xcite .",
    "this derives from the fact that up to an overall phase factor , any two - dimensional unitary matrix can be written as @xcite @xmath8          e^{i(\\phi-\\nu ) } \\sin \\lambda   &   \\",
