    "observational astronomy has entered a new era of large surveys that will produce incredible amounts of data at rates that are pushing beyond the limits of our ability to process in real time .",
    "coinciding with this flood is an ever growing mountain of archival data that is increasingly under - utilised .",
    "intelligent methods to quickly and accurately identify astrophysical sources are needed , with machine learning algorithms proving to be very effective in this respect .",
    "the random forest machine learning algorithm ( hereafter referred to as rf ) has shown great promise in the automatic classification of variable stars @xcite , the photometric classification of supernovae @xcite , and most recently the automatic classification of variable x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "rf is an ensemble supervised classification algorithm that builds a forest of decision trees using a bootstrap sample from a training set of sources with known classification @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most accurate classification algorithms available @xcite , is extremely fast , and can handle large data sets with a large number of features .",
    "in addition , there are only two parameters that the user needs to specify  the number of randomly selected features used at each node within the decision tree , and the number of trees in the forest  making it extremely easy to use .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we investigated the feasibility of using rf to automatically classify the variable x - ray sources in the second data release of the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalog ( 2xmmi - dr2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the time of its release in august 2008 , 2xmmi - dr2 was the largest x - ray source catalog ever produced .",
    "we used the sample of 2xmmi - dr2 variable sources that had been manually classified ( farrell et al . in prep ) as a training set for the rf classifier , obtaining an accuracy ( evaluated through 10-fold cross - validation ) of @xmath097% . @xcite",
    "also demonstrated the capability of rf to identify outlier sources that may represent rare new source populations , a stated scientific goal of most astronomical surveys .",
    "the training set was comprised of sources belonging to 7 categories : active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , super soft sources ( ssss ) , stars , ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .",
    "the third _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalog ( 3xmm - dr4 , hereafter referred to simply as 3xmm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was released in july 2013 and contains 531,261 detections of 372,728 unique sources of which 3,696 are flagged as variable .",
    "3xmm represents a @xmath040% increase in unique sources over 2xmmi - dr3 , and a @xmath063% increase in variable sources over 2xmmi - dr2 .",
    "3xmm was constructed from 7,427 _ xmm - newton _ observations with the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) performed between 3 february 2000 and 8 december 2012 , and is the largest x - ray source catalog so far released .    in this paper",
    "we present a catalog of 3xmm variable sources that have been classified into six source categories using the rf classifier ( hereafter referred to as the source class classification ) .",
    "as this is a serendipitous catalog , we would not expect a difference in the composition of sources in 2xmmi - dr2 versus 3xmm .",
    "we thus employed the same sample of 2xmmi - dr2 variable sources as used in @xcite for a training set .",
    "we also present the results of a study into the effectiveness of using the rf classifier to discriminate between spurious and real sources in the 3xmm catalog ( hereafter referred to as the quality control classification ) .",
    "each unique source in both our training sets and our sample of unknown sources has multiple detections and thus a number of sets of x - ray features . in each observation",
    "a source may be detected by one or all of the three epic cameras , which in turn may have multiple exposures within a given observation ( each with a unique light curve , although the other 3xmm features are the same for all exposures for a given camera within an observation ) . in addition , a number of fields were observed more than once providing additional detections taken at different epochs .",
    "we treated each detection independently in both the training and test sets and thus classified each detection separately .",
    "however , we combined the separate classifications from each detection to provide an overall classification ( see  3 for details of how this was performed ) .    with a few exceptions we used the same features for our classification as we used in @xcite .",
    "from 3xmm we took the four hardness ratios and errors , the galactic latitude and longitude , the 0.2 - 12 kev ( i.e. band 8) flux , the source extent ( in arcseconds ) and the ( maximum ) likelihood of the source being extended , the distance to the nearest neighbour in 3xmm , the source quality flag , and the confusion flag .",
    "the hardness ratios are defined as the ratio of count rates in two adjacent bands ( normalised so as to always be between @xmath21 and + 1 ) .",
    "they provide information on the crude shape of the x - ray spectrum and can thus be a powerful discriminator between different x - ray emissions mechanisms and thus different source types . however , when a source is not detected in either band used to calculate a hardness ratio , the resulting value is essentially a random number between @xmath21 and + 1 .",
    "we therefore set the hardness ratio to a flag value of @xmath3 and the error to 0 when both count rates used to calculate the hardness ratio were within 3@xmath4 of zero . to generate the timing features , we analysed the 3xmm light curves using the same methods in @xcite after filtering out all points that lie outside the light curve good time intervals ( gtis ) .",
    "we searched for periodic variability ( using the generalised lomb - scargle periodogram from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , power law decays , flares ( using the bayesian blocks technique ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also extracted a range of statistical features .",
    "a detailed description of how these features were extracted is given by @xcite . table [ xray_features ] provides a complete list of the x - ray and timing features included in our classification .",
    "in addition to the x - ray features , we cross - matched our variable source sample against multi - wavelength catalogs .",
    "we used the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for optical and near - infrared matches and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the second epoch molonglo galactic plane survey ( mgps-2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to search for radio counterparts , using the 3@xmath4 errors as a match criteria .",
    "when multiple counterparts were found we took the closest match as the correct one .",
    "magnitudes in the bvr optical and jhk near - infrared bands , radio flux densities , as well b@xmath2v , v@xmath2r , j@xmath2h , and h@xmath2k colors were provided for those sources for which a counterpart was found .",
    "we also calculated x - ray to optical , x - ray to near - infrared , and x - ray to radio flux ratios for each band as well as the probability of a chance cross - match using the bayesian method from @xcite .",
    "we note that due to the way that our training set sample was constructed ( i.e. identifying 2xmm sources by matching against the simbad and ned data bases ) creates a bias towards brighter well known sources .",
    "as such a higher proportion of our training set sources have multi - wavelength matches than the overall 3xmm variable source sample , potentially leading the model to confuse fainter sources that do not have a match due to the limited sensitivity of the catalogs with brighter sources that by their nature do not have a multi - wavelength match . in an attempt to counteract this bias",
    "we set the multi wavelength features to flag values of @xmath5 for those sources where no counterpart was found , so that the model will down - weight the importance of the multi - wavelength properties for fainter sources to 13@xmath1 when imputation was employed . ] .",
    "similarly , for those sources where a counterpart was identified but magnitudes , fluxes , and/or colors were missing we set the relevant missing values to @xmath5 .",
    "we chose flag values way outside the parameter space so that when smote oversampling ( see below ) is employed the flag values will still remain significantly removed from the true parameter space .",
    "in @xcite we cross - matched our sample against the third reference catalog of galaxies ( rc3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to identify which sources were potentially extragalactic .",
    "rc3 contains @xmath023k galaxies within a distance @xmath6 600 mpc , with a mean distance of @xmath040 mpc and a standard deviation of @xmath050 mpc . for this work we instead used a sample of @xmath01.4 m galaxies @xmath6 65 gpc extracted from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) that had angular sizes and distances , which has a mean distance of @xmath02 gpc and a standard deviation of @xmath04 gpc .",
    "we cross - matched our sample against this ned galaxy catalog using the 3@xmath4 x - ray source position and the galaxy d25 ellipse as a match criteria .",
    "when multiple matches were found we took the galaxy closest to the 3xmm position as the correct match .",
    "the features that were included for the galaxy cross - match include : a boolean flag indicating whether or not a match was found , the angular separation between the 3xmm source position and the galaxy centre , the ratio of the source / galaxy angular separation and the elliptical radius of the galaxy in the direction of the source ( @xmath7 ) , and the log of the luminosity ( calculated from the 0.2  12 kev 3xmm flux and the galaxy distance ) .",
    "as for the multi - wavelength matches described above we set flag values for sources where no match was identified in order to counteract the bias towards brighter sources in our training sample . for sources where no match was found , we set the angular separation and @xmath7 to 1 @xmath8 10@xmath9 and log(l@xmath10 ) to @xmath11 as flags .",

    "as in @xcite we used the ` r ` package @xcite ` randomforest ` @xcite for our classification .",
    "this is an open source package that is freely available to the community , not proprietary code that we have written ourselves . to determine the optimal number of features we used the function ` tunerf ` in ` randomforest ` , iterating through a range of values between 2  20 for the number of features ( with the number of trees set to 100 ) and comparing the out of bag ( oob ) error for each run until a plateau was reached .",
    "we found the optimal number of features to be 15 for the source class classification and 16 for the quality control classification . to determine the optimal number of trees we again used ` tunerf ` with the number of features set at the optimal value but varying the number of trees in each run again until a plateau in the oob error",
    "was reached . for both classification runs the optimal number of trees was found to be 500 .    to evaluate the accuracy of our classifiers we used the same 10-fold cross - validation method as outlined in @xcite . in our previous work we estimated an accuracy of @xmath097% for classifying the 2xmmi - dr2 variable sources @xcite",
    "however , we used the entire training set for the 10-fold cross - validation , which unintentionally introduced a bias into the accuracy estimation .",
    "our training and test sets were comprised of randomly selected detections for the cross - validation without cross - registration between detections by unique source number . as such",
    ", it is possible to have rows in both the training set and the sample to be classified that correspond to the same source and have almost identical features .",
    "if this happens the classifier is essentially classifying data in the test sample using a model built from ( almost ) the same data , thus producing an unrealistically high classification accuracy . to avoid this bias we randomly selected sources for the training and test sets for the cross - validation by unique source number , thus ensuring that all the detections for each unique source will either be in the training set or the test set , but never in both .",
    "however , we used the entire training set ( i.e. with multiple rows per source per observation ) to build the model for the classification of the unknown source sample .",
    "we expect that the higher the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the x - ray detection the better rf should perform with respect to the classification of real sources , as the fractional error of the x - ray parameters will reduce with increased photon counts .",
    "we tested this assertion empirically , finding that the classification accuracy did indeed increase with the s / n of the x - ray detection ( from 73@xmath1 accuracy for detections with s / n @xmath18 1 to 96@xmath1 accuracy for detections with s / n @xmath16 1000 , evaluated through 10-fold cross - validation ) . to obtain the overall classification for each unique source in our main classification",
    ", we thus took the mean of the individual detection classifications for each source class weighted by the number of photon counts in that detection .",
    "the overall classification of a unique source is taken as the source class with the highest probability . for our quality control classification",
    "we simply took the mean of the individual detection classifications , as higher photon counts do not correspond with a more precise classification as the majority of spurious detections are due to the presence of very bright nearby sources and therefore have high s / n ratios .",
    "for the source class classification , we used the same sample of manually classified variable 2xmmi - dr2 sources as in @xcite .",
    "the release of the 3xmm catalog involved a bulk reprocessing of all the _ xmm - newton _ data and thus includes a number of improvements that have been incorporated into the pipeline ( such as improved source characterisation , astrometry , and greater sensitivity ) .",
    "we therefore cross - matched the @xcite training set of 873 2xmmi - dr2 sources against 3xmm in order to take advantage of these improvements , finding a match for 869 of them .    in @xcite",
    "we separated the training set into 7 classes : agn , cvs , grbs , ssss , stars , ulxs , and xrbs .",
    "these classes made up the main types of sources identified through manual classification , and generally have very different physical properties .",
    "although ssss are a sub - class of cvs ( with a white dwarf accreting from a binary companion undergoing steady thermonuclear burning ) , they have extremely soft x - ray spectra with very little emission above 1 kev and thus appear quite different to the bulk of other cvs , leading us to consider them as a different class of object in @xcite .",
    "however , some novae ( another sub - class of cvs present in our sample ) have been observed to transition into a super - soft phase where they show similar x - ray properties to ssss , but at other times look very different .",
    "we therefore combined our sss and cv samples for this classification , as in principle there is no way that the classifier should be able to differentiate between a persistent sss and a nova in a super - soft phase .",
    "indeed , without multiple observations of the same source over a long timescale ( which would allow us to identify novae passing through a transient sss phase and a persistent sss ) we are unable ourselves to discriminate between the two types of object .",
    "table [ training_set ] shows the breakdown of the training set into our 6 source classes .    as can be seen in table [ training_set ]",
    "our training set is heavily unbalanced , with the number of detections of the most abundant class ( stars ) outnumbering the rarest class ( grbs ) by a factor of @xmath0240 .",
    "this imbalance will significantly bias the model towards classifying an unknown object as the majority class ( i.e. stars ) , leading to a higher accuracy for classifying stars but a lower accuracy for classifying the minority classes ( in particular grbs ) , despite rare objects being of particular interest to us . to compensate for this bias we oversampled all classes except for the stars using the smote algorithm @xcite , which creates synthetic minority class samples with feature values selected using the k - nearest neighbours method from within the parameter space of the real sources belonging to a given class .",
    "we used the smote implementation in the ` dmwr ` package @xcite in ` r ` to oversample the agn by a factor of 3.5 , the cvs by a factor of 7 , the grbs by a factor of 200 , the ulxs by a factor of 15 , and the xrbs by a factor of 2 .",
    "this oversampling thus provided approximately similar detection numbers for each class in the model as the dominant class of stars . to evaluate the impact of oversampling on the classification accuracies we built rf models both with and without smote oversampling .",
    "we found that the overall 10-fold cross - validated classification accuracy and the accuracy for classifying the majority star class did not change significantly when oversampling was employed ( they were consistent with the non - oversampled accuracies within 1@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the classification accuracy for the minority grb class improved significantly ( from 13@xmath1 to 46@xmath1 ) with oversampling . as such",
    ", we chose to use oversampling for our subsequent analyses .",

    "spurious detections can also occur due to optical loading from bright stars , as the epic cameras ( particularly the mos detectors ) are sensitive to bright optical emission that can produce features in the images that are incorrectly detected as x - ray sources .",
    "each source in the catalog is automatically assigned a quality flag ( sum_flag ) by the pipeline based upon its proximity to regions that may cause issues with the reliability of source parameters / products or where spurious detections commonly occur ( e.g. near a bright point source or diffuse emission ) .    while filtering out sources with quality flags @xmath20 2 will provide a reliable sample ,",
    "the way in which the flags are assigned means that such a filtering criteria will also discard bright real sources ( around which spurious detections are common ) that are potentially of interest to the user .",
    "spurious detections are easily identifiable through inspection of images and source products , so we hypothesised that spurious sources could be automatically identified via rf classification . to test this",
    ", we constructed a binary training set of non - spurious and spurious sources .",
    "for the sample of non - spurious sources we used the sample of spurious sources that were identified during our manual classification of the 2,267 2xmmi - dr2 variable sources ( farrell et al . in prep ) .",
    "for the sample of non - spurious sources we used the same sample described in  3.1.1 that we used for our main classification ( with the source class simply set to ` real ' ) . as with the main classifier training set ,",
