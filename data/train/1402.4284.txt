    "thermal effects on response functions are also discussed .",

    "in this section , we give explicit expressions for the matrix elements of the residual particle - hole ( ph ) interaction , @xmath2 . within the context of edf and lr",
    "theory @xcite , they can be obtained by performing a second functional derivative of the total energy as @xmath3 where @xmath4 refer to the momentum and spin and isospin projections of the corresponding particle or hole , and @xmath5 stands for the occupation number matrix .",
    "due to momentum conservation , there are only three independent momenta , which we choose as those of the holes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the transferred momentum @xmath8 , using the standard notation @xcite .",
    "each p - h pair must be coupled to well - defined values of spin @xmath9 and projection @xmath10 . regarding the isospin , it is more convenient in anm to work in the proton / neutron formalism .",

    "( [ mel : nn ] ) we observe that , analogously to the symmetric matter case  @xcite , the tensor term ( second line ) acts only in the @xmath27 channel , and couples different projections @xmath10 and @xmath28 , while the spin - orbit term ( last line ) couples both spin channels .",
    "the method for calculating rpa response functions has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite for snm .",
    "it consists in first solving the bethe - salpeter equation for the rpa p - h propagator , taking advantage of the particular form of the p - h interaction in momentum space , and afterwards averaging the p - h propagator over momenta to get the response function .",
    "some details on the method have recently been given in @xcite .",
    "here we generalize it for anm , which will be characterized by the asymmetry parameter @xmath29 , defined as the quotient between the isoscalar and isovector densities .",
    "the first required ingredient is the hartree - fock ( hf ) retarded propagator of a non - interacting p - h pair .",

    "the hf p - h propagator can thus be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi - dirac occupation number of @xmath30-particles , given by the step function @xmath33 at zero temperature , and @xmath34 is the single - particle energy @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean field , excluding the @xmath37 dependence contributing to the effective mass @xmath38 , written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are edf coupling constants .",

    "we will often deal with momentum averages similar to the previous one , which will be indicated within brackets : @xmath44 .",
    "notice that the hf propagator is independent of the spin - channel , and so is the response @xmath45 .",
    "the correlated rpa p - h propagator depends however on the p - h spin and isospin quantum numbers . since we do not consider charge - exchange processes we can write the bethe - salpeter equation as @xmath46 the residual interaction links two p - h pairs with quantum numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and hole momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details about the adopted notation .",

    "( [ bseq ] ) successively with the functions @xmath52 , @xmath37 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and integrating over the momentum @xmath49 .",
    "as compared to the snm case , the number of equations is doubled because of the isospin indices @xmath56 .",
    "the tensor term @xmath57 is only effective on the @xmath27 channel , but it can also influence the @xmath58 channel , due to the mixing between both spin channels induced by the spin - orbit term @xmath59 . similarly",
    "to snm @xcite this coupling can be absorbed into an effective coefficient @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "appendix [ app - wp ] ) , so that we deal in practice with two separate systems for each spin channel .    for fixed values of the spin quantum numbers @xmath61",
    "there are four possible isospin combinations , namely @xmath62 .",
    "however , due to isospin properties of the residual interaction , equations can be actually decoupled in two subsystems .",
    "one of them is for the couple @xmath63 and it can be written in matrix form as @xmath64 where the column vector @xmath65 contains the unkown momentum averages of the rpa propagator , @xmath66 are square matrices which depend on the edf coupling constants and averages of the hf propagator , and @xmath67 are column vectors depending on hf averages .",
    "the explicit expressions of these quantities are given in appendix [ app : eqs ] .",
    "the other subsystem is for the couple @xmath68 , which is obtained from the previous one by simply replacing @xmath69 .",
    "the number of coupled equations for each subsystem is 6 for the channel @xmath58 , and 8 for @xmath27 .",
    "the expressions become cumbersome , preventing us to write the response function in a compact form as in snm  @xcite or pnm  @xcite . instead , it is preferable to numerically solve these systems in the @xmath70-space .",
    "we have nevertheless relied on the analytical systems to derive some interesting quantities , as for instance sum rules .    as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the relevant spin - isospin responses are given by the combinations @xmath71 actually , instead of the response functions we deal with the corresponding strength functions , defined as @xmath72 since all physical properties are actually embedded into it .",
    "to present our results , we have chosen the asymmetry parameter values @xmath73 , and 0.5 , which roughly correspond to the isospin asymmetry of @xmath74pb and the @xmath75-equilibrium condition , respectively . to complete the discussion we will also show the extreme cases of snm ( @xmath76 ) and pnm ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "notice that only the spin channels @xmath61 are relevant in the latter case .",
    "we have performed calculations at densities 0.16 and 0.08  @xmath78 .",
    "the former value corresponds to the saturation density of snm and the bulk density of finite nuclei",
    ". the latter one will give information about the surface of nuclei or the crust of neutron stars .",
    "all the displayed results have been calculated using the skyrme interaction t44  @xcite , as in previous works on snm and pnm  @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ response : q01 ] , we show the strength functions @xmath79 calculated at density @xmath80  @xmath78 for a momentum transfer @xmath81  @xmath82 .",
    "the spin channels @xmath83 are displayed in panels ( a - d ) and ( e - h ) , respectively . as a reference ,",
    "the hf strength function which is independent of the spin - isospin channel has also been displayed in panels ( a - d ) .",
    "it can be seen that for the intermediate values of the asymmetry parameters ( @xmath73 and 0.50 ) the function @xmath84 is in fact the superposition of two strengths , one for protons and the other for neutrons .",
    "each one reflects the different fermi momenta and effective masses of protons and neutrons .",
    "the residual ph interaction preserves this two - peaks structure in the rpa strength , except in channel @xmath85 , which displays a single and broad resonance .",
    "the collective peak in the @xmath86 channel of snm is shifted to the low - energy region as @xmath87 increases , also reducing its height . regarding the @xmath27 channel",
    ", one can see that the collective states existing in both snm and pnm is split in two well - separated peaks .",
    "their location is nearly the same for any value of @xmath10 and @xmath88 .",
    "the tensor interaction manifests in particular as differences in the @xmath89 and 1 strength functions .",
    "these differences are more visible in the isospin @xmath90 channel and practically negligible in the @xmath91 one .",
    "strengths calculated at @xmath92 and 1.34  @xmath82 and the same density value are plotted in figs .",
    "[ response : q04 ] and  [ response : q1 ] , respectively .",
    "the two - peaks structure in the @xmath27 channel washes out as the momentum transfer is increased , becoming broader and less intense .",
    "tensor effects are also magnified as @xmath0 increases , with more pronounced differences between the @xmath93 strengths , irrespective of the isospin @xmath88 .",
    "it is worth noticing the huge peak in channel @xmath94 at low values of @xmath95 for all values of @xmath87 . as will be discussed in subsection [ instab ] , this peak evolves to an instability at zero energy  @xcite .",
    "consider now the lower density @xmath96  @xmath78 .",
    "[ response : q0108 ] and [ response : q108 ] display the strengths calculated at the same transferred momenta than figs .",
    "[ response : q01 ] and [ response : q1 ] , respectively .",
    "a glance to the employed energy scales suffices to notice that the lowering of the density induces a global shift of the strength towards the low - energy region . for the transferred momentum @xmath81  @xmath82 the strengths in the different @xmath27 channels",
    "are nearly superimposed . for the asymmetries @xmath97 and 1",
    ", a collective state is clearly visible in the channel @xmath90 ,",
    "well separated from the continuum edge .",
    "analogously to figs .",
    "[ response : q01 ] and [ response : q1 ] , the strength function spreads as @xmath0 increases .",
    "however , an increase of the @xmath85 strength at low energies is noticeable .",
    "actually , as we shall discuss in subsection [ instab ] , this huge peak is related to the spinodal instability .    as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite a very efficient tool to check the calculated linear responses is provided by their energy weighted sum rules .",
    "the sum rule or order @xmath13 is defined as @xmath98 and can be numerically calculated from this expression .",
    "alternatively , odd - order sum rules can also be obtained from appropriate expansions of response functions in power series of the transferred energy  @xcite as @xmath99 the linear and cubic energy - weighted sum rules @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be easily obtained from the first two terms of ( [ mmp : analytic ] ) , while the inverse energy - weighted sum rule @xmath102 is the first term of ( [ mm1:analytic ] ) .",
    "we have derived these analytic expressions using symbolic programs , but the expressions are too long to be presented here . for @xmath103 , we have used the independent check of double - commutator technique  @xcite to properly verify our results .",
    "our aim in comparing numerical and analytical sum rules is to have a good test about the reliability of our calculations .",
    "besides , this comparison provides an independent way to localize collective states .",
    "the @xmath102 sum rule is also interesting by itself because , apart from a trivial factor , it is the static susceptibility , or response function at zero energy .",
    "it is thus a very efficient tool to detect the instabilities related to a zero - energy mode , as already found in the case of snm and pnm in  @xcite .",
    "such a mode corresponds to a solution of @xmath104 , and has an infinite strength .",
    "equivalently , these modes can be seen as divergencies in the sum rule @xmath102 . as an illustrative example , in fig .",
    "[ mm1:t44 ] , we present the results for the asymmetry parameter @xmath97 .",
    "numerical ( [ mmp : numeric ] ) and analytical ( [ mm1:analytic ] ) sum rules @xmath102 have been plotted as a function of @xmath0 . for the spin @xmath58 channel the two curves stay on top of each other showing that the calculations are reliable .",
    "both curves also coincide for @xmath27 , except near some particular value of @xmath0 , where a singularity appears .",
    "this kind of singularity will be discussed in subsection [ instab ] .",
    "we now consider the effect of temperature in the rpa response function .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a study about the inclusion of temperature in the many - body problem .",
    "thermal effects in the rpa strength for snm have been discussed in  @xcite in the context of skyrme interactions . in practice",
    "one has to modify the occupation probability of levels as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the chemical potential and @xmath34 is the hf single particle energy .",
    "the generalization to finite temperature of the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bseq ] ) and the related algebraic systems of equations can be easily done . from a technical viewpoint",
    "one has simply to include it in the auxiliary functions @xmath107 defined in appendix  [ app : eqs ] .    at temperature @xmath108 , the system is initially in the ground state , and the sole possible effect of the external probe is to excite the system , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath109 .",
    "however at non - null temperature the ground state of the system at equilibrium corresponds to a statistical mixture of states . using the detailed - balance theorem ,",
    "the strength function is properly defined as @xmath110 in that case , it is possible to transfer energy from the system to the probe , so that negative values of @xmath95 are admissible .",
    "actually , thermal effects become relevant at values of temperatures larger than @xmath111  mev , and the limit of evaporation in finite nuclei appears at @xmath112 - 10  mev  @xcite . as a case of study we have performed calculations at @xmath113  mev , a temperature which can be relevant for homogeneous systems of astrophysical interest . in fig . [",
    "response : tt ] are displayed the strength functions calculated at density @xmath114  @xmath78 and asymmetry parameter @xmath97 , for two values of the transferred momentum , namely @xmath81  @xmath82 ( left panel ) and 1.34  @xmath82 ( right panel ) .",
    "these responses should be compared to those in panels ( c ) and ( g ) of figs .",
    "[ response : q01 ] and [ response : q1 ] , respectively . as a rule",
    ", temperature tends to wash out the structure of the response and spread its strength .",
    "an important part of the strength is shifted to the negative energy region , and the strength in some channels largely increases at zero energy .",
    "notice also that each peak at positive energies has a corresponding `` image '' at negative energies , which corresponds to the deexcitation of the heated system . for this specific value of density",
    ", the strength in channels @xmath115 develops a huge zero - energy peak . actually , it is the precursor of an unphysical instability , as we will immediately discuss .      in the previous subsections",
    "we have encountered some cases were the strength function is hugely peaked at zero energy .",
    "this peak will become a divergence for specific values of density and momentum transfer .",
    "some of these instabilities are unphysical , as they are simply reflecting drawbacks of the employed interaction  @xcite .",
    "but at low values of density , the instabilities are related to the physical phenomenon of spinodal transition . as mentioned previously , the inverse - energy - weighted sum rule @xmath102 is the tool of choice for the detection of poles of response functions at zero - transferred energy , and was employed in refs  @xcite to analyze instabilities in snm and pnm .",
    "let us consider first the instabilities appearing in the channel @xmath116 at low values of density .",
    "they are related to the thermodynamic spinodal transition of homogenous matter , where density fluctuations induce a decrease of the total free energy and are thus amplified until a separation in two distinct stable phases , liquid and gas , is reached .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the curvature of the free energy contains two terms : one proportional to @xmath117 coming from density gradient terms of the energy functional , and another proportional to @xmath118 related to the coulomb interaction .",
    "for small values of @xmath0 the energy cost due to coulomb interaction dominates and implies a sensitive reduction of the spinodal region for proton - rich systems . note that in the case of a neutron star where a background of electrons is present , the net effect of the coulomb interaction in the residual interaction is to reduce the region of the spinodal as well  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ spinodal : t44 ] , we have plotted the spinodal contours in the plane @xmath119 of proton / neutron densities for different values of the transferred momentum @xmath0 at zero temperature ( left panel ) and @xmath120  mev ( right panel ) . the homogeneous system is unstable inside these contours .",
    "since coulomb interaction has been ignored in our description , the spinodal region is symmetric with respect to the line @xmath121 , and is reduced as @xmath0 is increased , the largest possible region being that at @xmath122 . in general , the effect of temperature is to suppress fluctuations .",
    "this can be seen on fig .",
    "[ spinodal : t44 ] by comparing the spinodal contours in both panels for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "finally one may wonder about the influence of the tensor interaction on these instabilities : as we have mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : form ] , although the tensor acts directly only in the @xmath27 channel , it can influence also the @xmath58 channel , due to the mixing between both spin channels induced by the spin - orbit term .",
    "this coupling has been absorbed into effective coefficients @xmath60 defined in appendix  [ app - wp ] ) .",
    "we have found that spin - orbit effects are very small , except at large values of the transferred momentum , as reflected in the @xmath123 power entering explicitly in @xmath60 .",
    "as the spinodal instability concerns the @xmath58 channel and implies relatively small values of the transferred momentum , it is very marginally affected by the tensor interaction , which can be safely neglected to analyze the spinodal region .",
    "we turn now to the unphysical instabilities , occurring in the @xmath27 channel .",
    "they have been analyzed in snm and pnm in terms of landau parameters associated to a specific skyrme interaction  @xcite . as these instabilities are related to a specific interaction ,",
    "fixing them will be of great help to establish bounds for the edf coupling constants .",
    "for a given value of the transferred momentum @xmath0 we define a critical density @xmath124 as the value beyond which the homogeneous system becomes unstable . in fig .",
    "[ s1:critical : t44 ] are plotted the values of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath27 channels and asymmetry parameters varying from @xmath76 ( snm ) to @xmath77 ( pnm ) in steps of 0.2 .",
    "actually , for pnm there are only two channels , @xmath125 , and the same curve is plotted in panels @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "one can see that for values of @xmath126 less that @xmath127  @xmath82 , the critical density is higher than the saturation density of snm ( in the figure , the horizontal line corresponds to the value 0.16  @xmath78 ) .",
    "the opposite happens for higher values of the transferred momentum . as a general trend",
    ", we can see that as a function of @xmath87 , the critical densities monotonically varies from a maximum value in snm to a minimum value for pnm , with small variations around @xmath128  @xmath82 .",
    "however the decrease is not linear and might be actually very pronounced as soon as a small asymmetry is introduced .",
    "we should keep in mind that all the curves are actually obtained from a combination of response functions in the isospin channels @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , when a small asymmetry is introduced some of these response functions may suddenly acquire a non - zero value and influence a lot the whole combination .",
    "although the calculations have been done with the single t44 interaction , one can extract a pragmatic criterion : to use the bounds imposed by both snm and pnm critical densities into a fitting procedure in order to get a stable interaction below such densities for all values of symmetries .",
    "we have also checked that the critical densities are reduced by only a few per cent at temperature @xmath113  mev .",
    "in this work we have generalized the formalism presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to calculate rpa response functions in asymmetric nuclear matter for a general skyrme energy density functional including spin - orbit and tensor terms .",
    "the responses are obtained by solving closed algebraic systems of equations , which have been explicitly presented .",
    "analytical expressions for the energy - weighted sum rules @xmath102 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in terms of interaction parameters are easily derived from them by using an algebraic code . however , since the number of equations is doubled as compared to the snm and pnm cases , the analytical expressions are rather cumbersome and it is preferable to compute them numerically .",
    "we have investigated the response functions in the different spin - isospin channels for specific conditions . to illustrate the general trend concerning the effect of asymmetry we have chosen four values of the parameter @xmath87 .",
    "they correspond to the @xmath74pb nucleus , asymmetric nuclear matter in @xmath75-equilibrium , snm and pnm .",
    "we have chosen two values of the density characteristic of homogeneous matter at saturation and the surface of atomic nuclei .",
    "all calculations have been done using the t44 functional as a typical one , and so our conclusions are not completely general .",
    "however , it seems that the behavior of anm is not just a simple interpolation between snm and pnm even if one has clearly identified how to go from one limiting case to the other in an analytical way .",
    "we have found that the tensor plays an important role in the response , leading to the presence of two well - defined collective states . in particular , as compared to the hf response , the tensor significantly amplify the separation between the two fermi surfaces .",
    "even small values of asymmetry have a sensible effect on response functions .",
    "this is at variance with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where it was concluded that varying the asymmetry parameter produces no spectacular variations in the response .",
    "however , these results were obtained using purely central forces , while important tensor effects have already been observed in our previous studies concerning snm and pnm . concerning thermal effects",
    ", we have shown that up to temperatures of 16  mev , the response function is not sizably modified .",
    "the static susceptibility is a key quantity to get some information about instabilities , and we have computed it through the related inverse energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "our results concerning the spinodal instability compare favorably with those of  @xcite . the general behavior obtained here for the spinodal region with respect to asymmetry and temperature",
    "reproduce nicely the physical features demonstrated in a very different context , as is the study of free energy curvature in fluctuation space  @xcite .",
    "apart from this physical instability , we have also put into evidence the unphysical instabilities , thus generalizing to anm the findings of  @xcite .",
