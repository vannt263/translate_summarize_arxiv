    "among the seventeen crystallographic groups of the euclidean plane , there are only two that act with no fixed - points .",
    "identifying points in the same orbit of the action of these groups leads to the well - known flat , closed 2-manifolds which are commonly known as the torus and the klein bottle .",
    "the three regular tessellations of the euclidean plane , in a natural way , give rise to the equivelar tessellations of these surfaces .",
    "these tessellations have been of interest to many ( see for example @xcite ) , and have a long history which includes the classic work of coxeter @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , giving the classification of regular and chiral maps on the torus .",
    "the topic has also drawn more recent attention , with the works of brehm , khnel @xcite , and of wilson @xcite , classifying all equivelar maps on the torus and klein bottle , respectively .",
    "there are precisely ten flat , closed 3-manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "each manifold arises as the quotient of @xmath0 by a fixed - point free crystallographic group , and thus can be seen in the broader setting of space - forms . in fact , the euclidean space - forms are the complete connected flat riemannian manifolds ; for more details on this topic see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "various properties of the flat , closed 3-manifolds have been studied recently ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite conway and",
    "rossetti coin the name _ platycosms _ for these manifolds , and give them a set of individual names .",
    "six of these manifolds are orientable and they can be grouped into platycosms satisfying one of three properties . the 3-torus is the most symmetric platycosm in the sense that it has an infinite group of isometries of the manifold containing @xmath1 as a subgroup . as a consequence of this , it is the only platycosm admitting regular tessellations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the isometry group of the didicosm ( also known as the hantzsche - wendt manifold @xcite ) is finite and in this sense it is the least symmetric of the platicosms .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the remaining four orientable platycosm which , together with the torus , are named the helicosms .",
    "their isometry groups contain a finite index subgroup isomorphic to @xmath2 , which induces a distinguished direction .",
    "our interest centers on the situation when the isometry group @xmath3 inducing a helicosm as a quotient , is taken to be a subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath4 $ ] of the regular tessellation @xmath5 of @xmath0 by cubes .",
    "the orbit - space @xmath6 gives rise to what we call a cubic tessellation of the corresponding helicosm .",

    "if @xmath3 preserves the tessellation , then we call the orbit - space of @xmath12 a _ twistoid _ on the manifold @xmath13 . the particular instance of twistoids on the @xmath14-torus has been previously considered , where they are called _",
    "toroids_. regular tessellations of these manifolds were classified by mcmullen and schulte @xcite .",
    "subsequently , mcmullen proved there are no chiral tessellations of the @xmath14-torus ( for @xmath15 ) ( see ( * ? ? ? * section 6h ) ) . recently the classification by symmetry type of all cubic tessellations of the 3-torus and didicosm were completed by hubard , orbani , pellicer , and weiss @xcite and hubard , mixer , pellicer and weiss @xcite , respectively .",
    "this paper is the third in a sequence of four papers classifying cubic tessellations of the platycosms , the first two being @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we show that there are no cubic tessellations on the hexacosm and in sections  [ s : di ] , [ s : tri ] and  [ s : tetra ] we classify all possible cubic tessellations of the dicosm , tricosm , and tetracosm , respectively , according to the structure of their automorphism group .",

    "recall that the outer automorphism group of @xmath142 is isomorphic to @xmath186 .",
    "since the symmetry group of every twistoid @xmath168 $ ] contains @xmath79 , which projects to an element @xmath187 of order @xmath26 in @xmath188 , it follows that @xmath189 is normal in @xmath188 and that @xmath190 is isomorphic to @xmath191 .",

    "in this section we will show that the twistoids on tetracosm can be classified into four distinct families .",
    "the tetracosm is the quotient of @xmath0 by the group @xmath196 .",
    "the canonical generators of this group are two 4-fold twists ( which we denote by @xmath197 and @xmath66 ) and one 2-fold twist ( which we denote by @xmath67 ) , all of which have parallel axes .",

    "hence , the group @xmath142 is generated by two twists whose axes are parallel ; one of them is a half - turn twist with translational component twice the translational component of the other one , which is a @xmath27-fold twist .",
    "since one of the generators is a 4-fold twist , all the axes of the generators must be parallel to some coordinate axis , that is , of types @xmath198 , @xmath199 or @xmath200 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the translational component of @xmath66 is @xmath201 .",
    "more generally , for @xmath147 , the axis of @xmath148 is @xmath202 . by choosing @xmath197 such that @xmath203 we observe that the axis of @xmath197 is @xmath204 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the @xmath205-plane .",
    "then the projection of @xmath5 to @xmath62 induces a square tessellation @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath66 preserves @xmath5 , it acts like a 4-fold rotation in @xmath10 with respect either to a vertex of @xmath10 or to a centroid of a square . without loss of generality and up to duality",

    "then @xmath79 is a symmetry of the twistoid @xmath213 $ ] if and only if @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath129 as the half - turn about the line @xmath222 .",
    "the axis @xmath129 is a line , about which @xmath129 acts like a reflection when considering its action on @xmath10 .",

    "note that @xmath79 and @xmath129 represent different outer automorphisms .",
    "furthermore , @xmath225 is a symmetry of the twistoid @xmath213 $ ] only if @xmath79 and @xmath129 are also symmetries .",
    "( note here that @xmath225 is a half - turn twist whose axis must act like a glide reflection in @xmath10 , which can happen only if @xmath223 .",
