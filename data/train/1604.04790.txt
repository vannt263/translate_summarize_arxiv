    "growth is about geometry , even in the presence of noise . the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class , which describes the fluctuations of growing one - dimensional interfaces",
    ", @xcite is known to also describe the statistics of the boundaries of balls with increasing radii on random two - dimensional manifolds which are flat on average @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the kpz class does not only entail the values of the critical exponents , but also the full probability distribution for the one - point and the two - point fluctuations , which were initially conjectured and later shown to follow airy processes @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "nonetheless , at this level the class splits into two subclasses . in band geometry ,",
    "i.e. , for an interface with periodic boundaries , the local fluctuations are ruled by the tracy - widom largest eigenvalue distribution associated with the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( tw - goe ) of random matrices @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interface has an overall circular shape , the fluctuations are those characteristic of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( tw - gue ) .",
    "what is the origin of such a splitting of the class into two topological flavors or subclasses ?",
    "recent work on discrete growth models and the kpz equation itself @xcite shows that , if the interface is in a band geometry but the underlying substrate is growing , the fluctuations are tw - gue , just as in the circular case .",
    "this shows that the interface does not need to have a non - zero global curvature for tw - gue statistics to occur .",
    "all these considerations point to relevant questions : what kind of change takes place in the kpz subclass when the topology of the base manifold on which growth occurs is changed in a continuous way ?",
    "what are the relevant subclasses occurring ?",
    "the possibility of exploring the kpz class on any riemannian manifold was already put forward with the proposal of a _ covariant form _ of the kpz equation , which was used to explore band and circular geometries simply by changing the base manifold @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , before reaching the kpz behavior , the system explored a transient state : a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) or an edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) crossover for band and circular geometry , respectively . as a particular case , in the absence of noise or diffusive terms",
    "one can study the equation which merely propagates an interface with a constant speed along the local normal direction related with the level set equation in the case of the dynamics of function graphs @xcite , which we call _ huygens equation_. if applied to an infinitesimal circle , such an equation yields balls of increasing radii around the central point .",
    "in @xcite , such a huygens equation was studied on random or disordered riemannian manifolds with short - range correlations , which are flat on average .",
    "the dynamics of ball boundaries with increasing radii were shown to fall into the kpz universality class , the radial fluctuations following the tw - gue distribution .",
    "a relevant point is that transients were absent in this case : kpz universal behavior was reached already for very short times .    in this work we study the effect of topology on the subclass structure of the kpz universality class , by exploring the interface fluctuations for growing balls on different types of random riemannian manifolds .",
    "more concretely , we study the interfaces developed by the huygens equation on cones of different opening angles , including the limiting cases of the cylinder and the plane , which is the case studied in @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : illust_3d ] for an illustration .",
    "our overall conclusion is that tw - goe statistics are characteristic of the cylinder , tw - gue behavior occurring for cones of arbitrary aperture angles @xmath0 , including the plane ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , a change takes place in the kpz universality subclass between tw - gue and tw - goe as the aperture angle of the base cone manifold is changed , for @xmath1 .",
    "transitions among the various kpz subclasses have been previously explored , although mostly when considering particular initial conditions which are such that , at long times , the interface divides into spatial regions in which statistics are of one or the other subclass .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for the case of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) model with an initial condition where particles are placed at the even integers . or the kpz equation with a double - wedge initial condition or , equivalently , a directed polymer on a half - space with an end - point fixed @xcite . in our present case ,",
    "the statistics are homogeneous throughout the system and change abruptly from tw - goe to tw - gue as soon as the aperture angle is non - zero .",
    "such a result complements those obtained in growing systems with a band geometry @xcite , in the sense that these two are the only relevant subclasses in the presence of this type of topological changes .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] discusses our general framework : the covariant kpz equation and huygens equation , considered on random conformal deformations of a given base manifold . in section [ sec : geometry ]",
    "we describe the parametrization that we will use for the cylinder , cones and plane , an the base metric . in section [ sec : numerics ] we discuss our numerical simulations of interfaces on random cones , the critical exponents , and the radial fluctuations .",
    "the fact that all cones have tw - gue radial fluctuations is justified in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "our conclusions and ideas for further work are finally outlined in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in previous works @xcite , we have proposed an extension of the kpz equation for which all terms are defined in a covariant manner , i.e. , the equation has the same form when expressed on any background metric .",
    "the equation expresses the evolution of a closed simple curve representing an interface .",
    "each point @xmath4 on the curve moves along the local normal direction , with a velocity affected by three different terms :    @xmath5 \\ , \\vec n(\\vec r ) .",
    "\\label{eq : ckpz}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath6 is the local unit normal vector , @xmath7 is the geodesic curvature , and @xmath8 is a zero - average gaussian noise , uncorrelated both in time and along the interface . the constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are free parameters , which characterize , respectively , irreversible growth , surface tension , and fluctuations in the growth events .",
    "in fact , this interface can develop self - intersections .",
    "thus , eq .   must be supplemented with an algorithm to treat them .",
    "a convenient choice is to remove always the smaller component @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we focused on the simplest case of eq .   with @xmath12 , which we call the _ huygens equation _ , namely ,    @xmath13    because it simply _ propagates _ any closed curve outwards , in a way which is similar to huygens principle for the propagation of a wavefront @xcite .",
    "if our initial curve is an infinitesimal circumference around point @xmath14 , then the evolution of our interface will be given by a set of _ balls _ on this metric , with linearly increasing radii .",
    "in @xcite we applied eq .   to the study of the growth of balls on two - dimensional _ random _ manifolds with smooth enough random metrics , which are flat on average and have short - range correlations .    in the present work we lift the condition that the random metrics need to be flat on average .",
    "let us consider any background metric , given by the metric tensor field @xmath15 .",
    "we can introduce an ensemble of metrics through    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a smooth enough random field with uniform average and short - range correlations ( as measured by the @xmath18 metric ) .",
    "this means that the metric @xmath15 is subject to a random conformal transformation or , alternatively , that we consider an _",
    "optical metric _ on the base manifold , with a position - dependent index of refraction .",
    "let us address the study of the statistical properties of interfaces generated by the huygens equation on random conformal deformations of a given base riemannian manifold @xmath15 , as expressed by eq .  .",
    "the division of the kpz class between band geometry and circular geometry can be recast in our riemannian geometry language by stating that band geometry refers to propagation of huygens equation on a cylinder , while circular geometry refers to propagation on a plane .",
    "thus , for a random metric based on the plane , the results of @xcite show that , as expected , the radial fluctuations obey tw - gue statistics . on a random metric based on the cylinder ,",
    "if we set up as initial condition a curve which wraps around it , the ensuing interface fluctuations should follow the tw - goe distribution .",
    "let us define a natural family of surfaces which interpolates between the cylinder and the plane : a set of cones of increasing opening angle @xmath0 between the axis and the axis and the generatrix , with @xmath1 for the cylinder and @xmath2 for the plane .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : illust_cone ] for an illustration .",
    "the cone can be understood as a plane from which a wedge of angle @xmath19 has been removed .",
    "we will address the following question : how does the distribution for the normal fluctuations of the interface interpolate between tw - goe for the random metric on the cylinder and tw - gue for the random metric on the plane ?",
    "cones are surfaces with zero gaussian curvature @xmath20 everywhere except at the vertex .",
    "the integral of @xmath20 over any domain containing the vertex is always the same , and equal to the _ angular defect _",
    "@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the sum of the angles of any geodesic triangle containing the vertex will be @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , there is a stronger version of this statement , that is a consequence of the gauss - bonnet theorem :    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 is the geodesic curvature of any curve @xmath25 surrounding the vertex . in the case of a random metric based on the cone , eq",
    ".   will be modified by fluctuations . yet",
    ", it shows that the integral of the geodesic curvature is a conserved quantity on average , and we can expect some observables of our interfaces to depend on @xmath0 .",
    "let us describe our cone manifolds in detail , starting with their embedding in 3d and moving to an intrinsic chart .",
    "[ fig : illust_cone ] shows the surfaces embedded in 3d space , the @xmath26 coordinates of an arbitrary point on one of these surfaces being given by    @xmath27    [ eq : conos_reales ]    where we have made the cones coincide on a base circumference of radius @xmath28 ( the thick blue line in fig .",

    "we have extended the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to work on random conformal deformations of any given base riemannian manifold .",
    "let us summarize the algorithm .",
    "the interface is considered to be a piecewise linear simple curve , with an adaptive number of points : if two points separate beyond a certain threshold @xmath44 ( in the base metric @xmath18 ) , a new point is included mid - way @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we take @xmath45 .",
    "each segment of the interface determines a tangent vector @xmath46 along the interface curve .",
    "we make it evolve along the local normal direction @xmath6 . in order to determine @xmath6 , we require the local metric tensor , @xmath47 .",
    "this is obtained , via eq .",
    ", by multiplying the local metric tensor of the base manifold by a random conformal factor , @xmath48 . then , we solve the equation @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the propagation of each segment at each time - step ( @xmath51 ) is performed in a straightforward way , but the evolution equation is supplemented with an algorithm in order to detect self - intersections @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the smaller component is always removed so that the interface remains a simple curve at all times .",
    "figures [ fig : cyl ] and [ fig : cone ] show some profiles obtained by our simulations , for a cylinder and for a cone with @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the initial radius is @xmath53 for the cylinder and @xmath54 for the cone .",
    "the random conformal factor @xmath48 is chosen as an uniform random deviate in @xmath55 $ ] . in both figures ,",
    "the top panel shows the ball profiles as obtained in the @xmath56 coordinate chart .",
    "the top - right panel is a zoom of a single profile .",
    "it can be noticed that the cylinder has much smaller fluctuations , as we will explain shortly .",
    "the center panels show how the previous interfaces fit on the original manifolds , the cylinder and the cone .",
    "the bottom panel , in both cases , shows the interface evolved up to the same time , @xmath57 .",
    "the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : cyl ] and [ fig : cone ] show that , in their 3d representation , the interfaces have comparable roughness .",
    "the apparent suppression of fluctuations in the @xmath41 representation for the cylinder is due to the form of its metric , eq .  .",
    "notice that it has a quasi - polar form , in which distances along the azimuthal line do not grow with the radius .",
    "thus , a given fixed interface which is parallel - transported upwards along the cylinder will appear less and less rough .      as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , ball boundaries on a flat - average random metric of the form of eq .",
    "follow the family - vicsek ansatz when considered as interfaces .",
    "specifically , the roughness of the ball boundary , as measured in the euclidean metric , grows with time as a power - law , @xmath58 , and so does the correlation length along the interface , @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , in the case studied in @xcite , the values of the critical exponents were shown to be those of the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us now consider the interfaces produced by huygens equation on our random cones .",
    "the average shape of the ball boundary for any given time is expected to be a circumference of radius proportional to @xmath62 . although we do not have a proper shape theorem for our general case , see @xcite for some rigorous shape theorems in particular manifolds .",
    "we define the roughness of a curve @xmath63 as the expected magnitude of the normal deviations of the actual interface from its best - fit circumference centered at the origin .",
    "notice that distances along the radial direction in the @xmath41 chart can be computed in an euclidean setting .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] shows this measurements of @xmath63 as a function of time , averaged over 100 realizations of the disorder , for a cylinder of radius @xmath64 , cones with opening angles @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the plane . in all cases ,",
    "the power - law behavior of the roughness with time , @xmath68 , is clear - cut , with a value of @xmath69 which is very close to @xmath70 , as expected .",
    "the family - vicsek ansatz also implies that the average roughness on windows of size @xmath71 will scale as @xmath72 if @xmath71 is smaller than the surface correlation length , @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the three critical exponents are related via @xmath74 . in our case ,",
    "direct measurements of the roughness exponent @xmath75 are involved , because distances along the curve should be carefully computed . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "we have devised a novel technique to measure the correlation length , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illust_corr ] . for a given interface ,",
    "we draw the best - fit circumference with centered at the origin , and mark all the intersection points between the circumference and the actual interface .",
    "they divide the circumference into a series of @xmath76 patches or arcs , whose actual lengths @xmath77 on the cone are measured along the azimuthal direction , being given by    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the radius of the best - fit circumference .",
    "we can estimate the correlation length asking the following question : if we choose a random point on the circumference , what is the expected length of the patch on which it stands ? on average , this value will be given by    @xmath80    notice that this value does not correspond to the average value for the patch lengths .",
    "the behavior of this correlation length @xmath81 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , where we can see that it follows a power - law , with exponent close to the kpz value @xmath61 in all cases .",
    "thus , we have checked the first claim , that the interfaces on cylinder , cones and plane , in all cases show the critical exponents of the kpz universality class .",
    "the kpz universality class does not only entail the values of the critical exponents . as discussed above ,",
    "the radial fluctuations are expected to follow one of the well known tracy - widom probability distributions . in the case of a ball on a random metric over the plane",
    ", it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that they indeed follow the tracy - widom statistics for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( tw - gue ) .",
    "we have developed an extension of the analysis in @xcite in order to obtain the radial fluctuations histogram for interfaces following the huygens equation on random conformal deformations of a base riemannian manifold , eq .  , assuming that a growing circumference is a solution of the aforementioned eq .  .",
    "along the simulation procedure described at the beginning of this section , the radial data are stored along with their time tag .",
    "we consider all pairs @xmath82 , from different noise realizations and times , and fit them to a linear form @xmath83 , whereby constant values @xmath84 and @xmath85 are obtained .",
    "then , we fit the fluctuations to a power law with time , namely ,    @xmath86    using the ensuing values of @xmath87 and @xmath69 ( = 1/3 ) , we finally extract the rescaled radial fluctuation @xmath88 as    @xmath89    notice that this @xmath88 variable is invariant under affine changes in the radii @xmath90 . we then obtain the histogram for these @xmath91 and further normalize it , in order to have a distribution with zero mean and unit variance . the theoretical prediction is that these histograms will correspond to the tw - goe and tw - gue distributions in the extremes of our family of surfaces : tw - goe for the cylinder ( @xmath1 ) and tw - gue for the plane ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these measurements have been carried out in three cases : ( a ) a cylinder with @xmath53 , for which we run 500 noise realizations and gather all the points obtained from 1000 snapshots in the time interval @xmath92 $ ] for each noise configuration , giving a total of @xmath93 points ; ( b ) a cone with @xmath65 , 500 realizations and 500 snapshots for each one with @xmath94 $ ] , a total of @xmath95 points ; ( c ) a cone with @xmath96 , 100 realizations and 1000 snapshots for each one with @xmath97 $ ] , a total of @xmath98 points .    before giving a quantitative assessment ,",
    "let us consider the visualization of these results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tw ] .",
    "since the tw - gue and tw - goe distributions are very close visually to the normal distribution , we plot the difference with the normalized gaussian probability density function , @xmath99 , which we call here _ non - gaussianity_. the top panel shows the non - gaussianity as a function of @xmath88 for the exact tw - goe and tw - gue distributions , and for the obtained radial fluctuations on the cylinder with @xmath53 , which fit closely the tw - goe distribution , as expected .",
    "the central and bottom panels show the analogous data for the cone with @xmath65 ( central panel ) and @xmath96 ( bottom panel ) . in these two cases ,",
    "the empirical distribution fits closely the tw - gue distribution , as we know to be the case for the plane @xcite .",
    "but , of course , this check is merely visual , and should be supplemented with further numerical comparisons .",
    "a more strict test is provided by the estimation of the third and fourth cumulants of the distributions , normalized as the skewness and the kurtosis , as shown in table [ tab : cumulants ] .",
    "the data for the cylinder can be seeen to correspond approximately to the tw - goe distribution , while they fit the tw - gue distribution for the cones in all cases .",

    "the numerical simulations discussed in the previous section allow us to extract several hypothesis .",
    "first , huygens propagation on random conformal deformations of cones of different opening angles are shown to fall into the kpz universality class , for all opening angles .",
    "we can also conjecture that , on the cylinder , the radial fluctuations follow tw - goe statistics , while for all the cones with @xmath100 we obtain tw - gue .",
    "this conjecture fits well with the results of @xcite , where it was shown that growth in a band geometry whose substrate expands at a constant rate in time follows the tw - gue distribution . in our geometric setting ,",
    "an expanding substrate is similar to a cylinder with a growing radius , i.e. , a cone .",
    "these results require some theoretical explanation , which we will attempt within our riemannian geometry framework .",
    "let us recall that huygens equation is _ covariant _ : solutions obtained using one coordinate chart can be mapped into solutions obtained using a different coordinate chart .",
    "the base metric tensor for all our surfaces , in a polar chart @xmath31 , has the form    @xmath101    where @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath3 , an affine change of coordinates ,    @xmath103    renders the metric euclidean . notice that this corresponds to viewing the cone as a plane from which a wedge of angle @xmath19 has been removed . for @xmath1 , of course , the change of variables becomes singular . and ,",
    "as noted in the previous section , an affine transformation in the @xmath90 coordinate will _ not change the @xmath88 distribution_.    let us now turn our attention to the conformal noise imposed upon the base metric . since we assume it to have vanishing short - length correlations , we can safely assume that it will be invariant under coordinate changes of any kind .",
    "combining both statements we find that , if @xmath3 , _ the radial fluctuations for growth of any cone must have the same form as in the euclidean case_. the same argument can not be applied to growth on the cylinder , since in that case the metric factor @xmath104 , and no affine change of coordinates in @xmath90 will map it to the euclidean case @xmath105 .",
    "notwithstanding , please notice that our argument does not entail that the cylinder and the plane must have different fluctuations .",
    "the difference between the cylinder and the rest of the cones is , moreover , topological .",
    "all cones are homeomorphic to the plane , while the cylinder is not .",
    "in fact , on the cylinder the huygens equation is applied in a different way . for any cone , we can start with an infinitesimal circumference around the vertex and produce balls around it . in the cylinder , we must start with a curve which is not homotopically equivalent to a point , because it will wrap around the manifold .",
    "but this difference by itself does not allow us to assert that growth on the cylinder will possess different kinds of fluctuations , since the cylinder can be smoothly _ completed _ with a lower lid , thus rendering our initial circumference homotopically trivial .",
    "thus , the difference between tw - gue and tw - goe behavior does not stem from the homotopy class of the initial curve .",
    "we have investigated the universality subclass structure of the kpz class in a riemannian geometry setting for disordered substrates .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of _ huygens _ interfaces on random metrics , see eq .  .",
    "a huygens interface is defined as a the propagation of an initial simple closed curve on a certain manifold , always following the local normal direction with unit speed .",
    "the metrics studied were conformal random deformations of a certain set of base manifolds : the euclidean plane , cones of different opening angles , and a cylinder . in the planar case ,",
    "it had already been shown @xcite that the interfaces follow kpz statistics , with tw - gue radial fluctuations .",
    "we have shown how kpz statistics are found in all other manifolds , with tw - gue fluctuations for the cones and tw - goe for the cylinder .",
    "there is no intermediate subclass between these two .",
    "a theoretical explanation of this fact has been put forward , based on the notion that the huygens equation is _ covariant _ , i.e. , it can be studied in any possible coordinate chart .",
    "all cones with non - zero opening angle are homeomorphic to the euclidean plane , but not to the cylinder .",
    "moreover , we have written down the explicit non - singular change of coordinates between the cones and the plane and shown that it has no effect on the statistical properties of the radial fluctuations of the interfaces , thus proving that all cones should present tw - gue statistics .",
    "this result fits very well with the results of @xcite , where it was shown that kpz systems in band geometry with an expanding substrate also feature tw - gue statistics .",
    "our work opens up many possibilities : what are the statistical properties of the covariant kpz equation on a generic manifold ? or , alternatively , which are the statistics of the huygens equation on random deformations of a certain base manifold ? in this case , we expect a far richer set of possibilities . the topological argument described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] suggests a possible methodology in order to extract the radial fluctuations when the manifold is homeomorphic to either the cylinder or the plane .",
