    "the observations were conducted between 1.4 and 1.7 ghz , as a trade - off between increasing pulsar flux at lower frequencies and improved resolution as well as reduced ionospheric effects at higher frequencies . at each epoch , 4 spectral windows ( ifs ) each with 8 mhz bandwidth",

    "the data were correlated in two passes , first centered on the pulsar field , and then a second pass centered on the in - beam calibrator .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for the pulsar was boosted by ` gating ' ( accepting signal from ) the correlator on at the expected times of arrival of pulses , using current pulse timing solutions obtained for each epoch from ongoing observations at the jodrell bank observatory .",
    "incremental phase calibration derived from observations of the in - beam source were applied to the pulsar for considerably improved calibration .",
    "data analysis was performed using the aips package with a customized pipeline ( brisken 2007 , in preparation ) , which included amplitude calibration based on the system temperatures and antenna gains , followed by visibility phase calibration based on the primary calibrator and the in - beam source .",
    "large scale ionospheric phase effects were estimated and corrected with the aips task tecor , using global models of the ionospheric electron content based on distributed gps measurements .",
    "once the calibration was completed , the pulsar position was measured by fitting a gaussian ellipse to calibrated images made separately for each if .",

    "this means that both the polar jet interpretation ( with the near - orthogonal view implying similar jet / counter - jet fluxes ) and the equatorial torus interpretation ( with a thin nearly edge - on torus ) remain viable .",

    "retain a 2-d angle @xmath65 ; for vectors separated by @xmath66 only 29% retain @xmath67 . thus the observed angle is , _ a priori _ , @xmath68 more likely to arise from an aligned system",

    "the extended emission observed at high energies suggests some flux in the 2  aperture is contributed by non - thermal emission .",

    "the association between psr j0538 + 2817 and s147 suggested by @xcite was based on their positional coincidence and apparent consistency of the distances and ages . in particular",
    ", the authors argued that since the pulsar location is near the snr center , it is unlikely to be a chance association . with our accurate proper motion measurement",
    "we can improve this argument . in order to have a quantitative estimate of the chance alignment probability",
    ", we did simple monte carlo simulations using the model by @xcite . following these authors , we assume the pulsars are born in the galactic plane with the galactocentric radial distribution from @xcite and exponential distribution in the scale height , and with birth velocities distributed as a two - component gaussian model .",
    "acceleration due to galactic potential was ignored for simplicity .",
    "our results show that in @xmath107yr , the most extreme age estimate for s147 , only 1 pulsar in @xmath108 would have a chance passage within 8   of the s147 center .",
    "we also applied the maxwellian pulsar velocity distribution suggested by @xcite , obtaining nearly identical result . with a galactic neutron star birthrate of 2.8 per century @xcite and a radio beaming factor of @xmath109 , the probability of finding a random , unassociated radio pulsar younger than",
    "1  myr which has passed within 8  of the snr center is @xmath110 .",
    "this estimate is a conservative upper limit to the probability : we believe the true age of s147 is considerably younger , and the high x - ray temperature of psr j0538 + 2817 also implies a younger @xmath111yr age .",
    "thus a more realistic chance probability is @xmath112 smaller . to conclude , psr j0538 + 2817",
    "is almost certainly associated with s147 and this implies a snr distance of @xmath113kpc .",
    "this value is substantially larger than some previous estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus it calls into question some papers that assume a much closer distance to s147 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in standard snr evolution ,",
    "the shell radius in the sedov - taylor phase is given by @xmath114pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the explosion energy is @xmath115ergs , age in @xmath116 years and external medium of density @xmath117 .",
    "the observed angular size of s147 @xmath118 @xcite corresponds to a physical radius of 35  pc at 1.47  kpc . for an age of 30  kyr @xcite , this requires a very energetic explosion of @xmath119 .",
    "this suggests s147 probably occurred in a low density stellar wind bubble , likely evacuated by the progenitor star in a wr phase @xcite .",
    "hence the snr had a long free - expansion phase , only passing to the sedov - taylor phase when it reached the cavity boundaries at relatively large radius .",
    "this scenario receives further support from the observed low expansion velocity of s147 at @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "note that the progenitor s proper motion can make the wind bubble asymmetric , with the cavity extending further behind the star @xcite .",
    "density gradients in the external medium can also enhance this asymmetry .",
    "indeed gas and dust surveys suggest that the medium to the south of s147 is denser and the shell is flattened with the brightest filaments on this side . supporting this ,",
    "the optical observations by @xcite provides some hint that the expansion rate is faster in the northern half of s147 .",
    "thus we generally expect the ` geometrical center ' to lie somewhat north of the true explosion site .      with the inferred distance to s147 ,",
    "it is possible to search for the birth - site of its parent star .",

    "this is a relatively massive @xmath128myr - old cluster @xcite and we consider it the prime candidate birth - site .",
    "if correct , the progenitor traveled from this cluster at pa @xmath129 with a 3-d space velocity of @xmath130 .",
    "we see no evidence in gas maps or the snr shell that the progenitor wind has disturbed the denser cloud to the south .",
    "this and the blowouts of the snr to the north argue against or as the parent cluster . to the north",
    "remains viable , but is distant at @xmath131pc and less massive .",
    "finally , it is intriguing to note that the @xmath132 nearest young cluster , the very poorly studied , lies precisely in the direction of the largest ( eastern ) extension of the snr shell ; the h@xmath5 shell here extends 40% ( @xmath133 ) further than the main shock front , with wispy emission present up to @xmath134 further in this direction .",
    "it is tempting to associate this blowout with a stellar wind trail extending along the path to ngc 2331 , but this cluster appears to be relatively low mass and may be too old , with no remaining b stars .      from the precise pulsar proper motion , we know that the supernova explosion must have occurred along the line in fig .  [ f1 ] with the arrowhead at the present pulsar position .",
    "the explosion site is determined by the true age of s147/psr j0538 + 2817 ; tick marks on the line indicate 20 , 40 and 60kyr ages .",
    "the simplest interpretation is to infer birth at the closest approach to the geometrical center 36kyr ago and assign an uncertainty of @xmath135kyr .",
    "however , if we can define a second axis for the progenitor motion , we can obtain a more precise age . if we adopt the symmetry axis suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solid lines in fig .",
    "1 ) then the birth - site is to the nw of the geometrical center and the intersection with the proper motion suggests a snr age near 20kyr .",
    "given the rather irregular nature of the northern half of the remnant and the argument that the explosion should be south of the geometrical center , we do not find this axis convincing .",
    "the axis to ngc 2331 intersects at a more plausible explosion age of 30kyr .",
    "if however we adopt ngc 1960 as the birth - site , then a explosion somewhat south of ( in front of ) the geometrical center becomes natural . without a blowout identifying an entry site",
    ", we can not set a precise axis , but the path should pass close to the geometric center , implying an intersection with the proper motion vector at @xmath136kyr .",
    "our conclusion is that the best estimate of the snr age is 40kyr with a maximum plausible range of @xmath137kyr .",
    "this is slightly older than the estimate of @xcite .",
    "however , the inferred initial spin period of psr j0538 + 2817 is not significantly changed .",
    "assuming magnetic spin - down with constant braking index @xmath138 , the initial spin period is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the kinematic and characteristic ages of the pulsar respectively .",
    "we obtained @xmath142ms ; the kinematic age of the pulsar is indeed much smaller than its spin - down age .",
    "only a few pulsars have estimated initial spin periods ; the value for psr j0538 + 2817 is the longest among these .",
    "of course , the high space velocity of the pulsar argues for a strong birth kick . note that with the large parallax distance to the pulsar , the binary break - up scenario described by @xcite is now even more improbable .",
    "if one further accepts a progenitor origin in the galactic plane near ngc 1960 , then the pulsar s present rapid return to the plane further supports a birth kick uncorrelated with its parent s motion .",
    "these considerations make a comparison of this pulsar s kick and spin direction particularly appealing .",
    "unfortunately the morphology of the extended structure near the pulsar is not clear enough to define a definitive spin axis and thus weakens this system s ability to cleanly test the spin - kick models .",
    "however , we can turn the question around : if the mechanism that seems to cause spin and kick alignment in other young pulsars acts on psr j0538 + 2817 , do we expect its spin to be more nearly aligned or orthogonal ? to retain a slow spin with a large kick velocity , the net kick vector must be nearly radial , applying little torque to the star .",
    "we have performed a series of simulation of neutron star birth kicks in a range of models where a single thrust is applied to the surface at fixed angle as the proto - neutron star cools , with amplitude proportional to the driving neutrino luminosity ( ng & romani 2007 , in preparation ) . comparing with the set of all neutron stars with initial spin and/or speed measurements , we have found ( for several models of proto - neutron star evolution and neutrino cooling ) the best - fit parameter distributions for the neutron star pre - kick spin , the kick amplitude , normal direction and duration that reproduce the observed pulsar spin and speed distributions . for these parameters ( fixed by a set of @xmath143 other pulsars ) we can ask whether a pulsar with slow initial spin like psr j0538 + 2817 is more likely to have its birth velocity and spin vectors aligned or orthogonal .",

    "ng & romani ( 2006 , in preparation ) discuss the significance of this result for improving kick constraints .      from the x - ray spectral results , the neutron star atmosphere fit gives an effective surface temperature of @xmath146k .",
    "this matches well to the standard cooling curve for the pulsar age of @xmath147kyr ( c.f .",
    "fig  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "comparing with the cooling models of @xcite we see that our best - fit @xmath148k surface agrees well with a typical cooling model at age @xmath149kyr .",
    "even so - called slow cooling neutron stars ( low mass stars , with crustal neutron pairing and/or accreted low z envelopes ) drop very rapidly below @xmath150k after @xmath7yr .",
    "thus if we interpret the thermal emission as full surface emission , it seems impossible for psr j0538 + 2817 to be as old as its characteristic age .",
    "in contrast , its thermal surface emission is quite consistent with its young @xmath151kyr kinematic age , requiring no direct urca process or any other exotic cooling mechanisms .",
    "_ xmm _ observations find a low 18% soft x - ray pulsation with a very broad profile @xcite .",
    "these authors interpret this as a hot polar cap from a nearly aligned rotator ( polar cap axis and rotation axis both close to the line of sight ) .",
    "this seems at odds with the radio polarization and pwn data , so a more natural interpretation might be emission from a gradual temperature variation across a light element surface , perhaps caused by magnetic dipole variation in the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as a re - heated cap emission the thermal flux would be a surprisingly large 1% of the full spin - down power .",
    "on the other hand , the non - thermal emission from the psr / pwn system as a whole is close to that expected . in an aperture of radius 15 ,",
    "the observed count rate in the @xmath152kev band is @xmath153 .",

    "for the case of psr j0538 + 2817 , the spin - down luminosity derived from the radio parameters @xcite is @xmath157 , which predicts an x - ray luminosity of @xmath158 , very close to the observed value .",
    "we have reported vlba astrometric measurements and chandra acis - i observation of psr j0538 + 2817 .",

    "these observations strengthen the association with s147 and suggest ngc 1960 as plausible birth - site for the progenitor star .",
    "it seems likely that the supernova occurred in a stellar wind bubble some 40kyr ago .",
    "the x - ray observations of the pulsar show that the thermal point source has a high temperature consistent with the 40kyr age and imply that it was the source of the observed snr .",
    "our deep chandra pointing reveals extended emission around the pulsar with a very compact symmetric structure observed in the 4 - 8  kev range .",
    "the overall pwn flux is broadly consistent with the emission expected from this relatively low @xmath159 spin - down pulsar , but the physical origin of the hard emission in these innermost regions is not clear .",
