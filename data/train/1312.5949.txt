    "<S> phenomenological effective interactions like skyrme and gogny forces are currently used in mean  field calculations in nuclear physics . </S>",

    "<S> body problem in the case where the effective skyrme interaction is employed in its standard form and the perturbative problem is solved up to second order . for simplicity , we focus on symmetric nuclear matter and its equation of state , which can be calculated analytically at this order . </S>",
    "<S> specific density dependences are found for which the problem is renormalizable , one of which generates a reasonable equation of state over a quite large range of densities around saturation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is shown that the standard skyrme interaction does not in general lead to a renormalizable theory . for renormalizability , other terms </S>",
    "<S> should be added to the interaction and employed perturbatively only at first order .    </S>",

    "<S> , the necessity of increasing the accuracy of theoretical predictions and of extending them to the exotic regions of the nuclear chart has motivated several groups to formulate beyond  mean  field models , which explicitly include more correlations in their formal scheme . </S>",
    "<S> several directions have been explored , for instance : projection techniques in the framework of the generator coordinate method @xcite ; second random  </S>",
    "<S> phase approximation ( srpa ) calculations with skyrme and gogny forces @xcite , as well as with an interaction derived from a realistic force @xcite ; particle  vibration coupling ( pvc ) techniques with the skyrme interaction @xcite and with a relativistic lagrangian @xcite ; multiparticle  multihole configuration mixing ( mpmhcm ) methods with both skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite forces .    </S>",
    "<S> a challenge faced by all these models is how to overcome the overcounting of correlations when conventional forces or lagrangians are used . </S>",
    "<S> conventional forces and lagrangians are actually designed for mean  field  based models , and the adjustment of their parameters is performed at this level . </S>",
    "<S> when the same interactions , with the same values of the parameters , are employed in calculations where different types of correlations are explicitly taken into account , a risk of double counting is present . in other words , when beyond  </S>",
    "<S> mean  field methods are used , the adjustment of the parameters should be done at the same level ( at the same order ) in the perturbative many  body problem . </S>",
    "<S> apart from this general problem , several technical difficulties are encountered in many of these sophisticated models . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention for instance the irregularities and the divergences that may be found in projection calculations @xcite and the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences that are present when zero  range interactions are employed in srpa , pvc or mpmhcm calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue of uv divergences in second  order calculations with the zero  range skyrme force has been addressed by two of us in the case of nuclear matter using cutoff @xcite and dimensional @xcite regularization techniques . </S>",
    "<S> new  </S>",
    "<S> generation skyrme  type interactions have been designed to provide a reasonable equation of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter by including first and second  order contributions in the evaluation of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> this approach produces well  defined results that avoid overcounting but depend on the arbitrary regularization procedure .    the specific problem of designing new interactions to be used in beyond  mean  field calculations can be viewed as a part of a more general issue : the formulation of an interaction that provides a renormalizable theory order by order in the perturbative many  body problem . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizability means that the theory is independent of the arbitrary regularization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> high  </S>",
    "<S> energy physics eliminated from loops by the regulator is accounted for in the coefficients of the interactions , which are then cutoff dependent in such a way as to ensure that observables are not . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizability is guaranteed once all interactions allowed by the symmetries of the underlying dynamics are included . </S>",
    "<S> the framework to accomplish this is that of effective field theories ( efts ) , which has been successfully applied to the physics of light nuclei over the last two decades @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ensuring renormalizability is , in turn , a step towards an even more general objective , that of searching for the correct power counting which indicates the proper hierarchy of allowed interactions . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent power counting generates at each order enough interactions so that any remaining regularization dependence can be eliminated with a sufficiently high value for the regulator parameter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , imposing renormalizability is a guide for theory construction , the best - known example being the development of the electroweak theory known as the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> a nuclear example is provided by pionless eft , where the existence of a three  body force in leading order was discovered by demanding renormalizability of the theory s description of the three - body system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the successes of mean  field models suggest that there should be a controlled expansion around it , but the expansion parameter has remained mysterious . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizability has not yet been extensively explored in the case of phenomenological effective interactions like gogny and skyrme forces . in this exploratory study , we focus on the zero  range skyrme force , which bears formal similarities with the interactions in pionless eft . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus implicitly assuming that non  </S>",
    "<S> relativistic nucleons are the only degrees of freedom relevant for the low  energy dynamics of the nuclei of interest , which is far from obvious . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed by including first and second  order contributions in the eos of symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to reveal the implications of demanding renormalizability through a redefinition of the existing parameters at each order ( at second order in the present work ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure can be followed for more complex forces , higher orders , different isospin composition , and finite nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the standard skyrme force @xcite , which contains central , density  dependent , and velocity  dependent terms of zero range . </S>",

    "<S> order terms unless @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) , but in this case the @xmath48 and @xmath49 divergences are too severe .    </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to have the @xmath45 divergence cancel out against other second  order divergences . in this special case </S>",
    "<S> the problem becomes renormalizable by imposing that @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> to do this , the parameter @xmath9 has to be constrained by @xmath51 , that is , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we must have @xmath53 as long as the discriminant @xmath54 , the solutions for @xmath39 are real . </S>",
    "<S> note that a solution is a function of all the other skyrme parameters , except @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 problem clearly arises from the very singular contributions generated by the two  derivative two  body force , and can be eliminated by setting @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath57 and the @xmath48 divergence can be absorbed in the mass @xmath16 for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a less drastic alternative is to require eq . without demanding that @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath59 , the @xmath48 term can be absorbed in @xmath37 : instead of eq . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath60 by solving @xmath61 we get a first  order equation in @xmath62 , and a quadratic equation in @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) upon solving @xmath65 . after </S>",

    "<S> thus the problem can be renormalized for specific values of @xmath9 and constraints over the skyrme parameters . </S>",
    "<S> typical values of the parameter @xmath9 range from 1/6 , for instance in the saclay - lyon forces @xcite , up to 1 , for instance in siii @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two of the values found here are located inside this interval . </S>",
    "<S> the third value , @xmath58 , is located outside . </S>",
    "<S> the two  derivative two  body force is usualy thought to be required for good fits of data . indeed , following the procedure described below we were unable to find a set of parameters that provides a reasonable eos in this case , which we do not consider further in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> as examples of the effects of the extra constraints over the skyrme parameters , we focus on the two cases @xmath59 and @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> if we impose the constraints that @xmath52 and @xmath12 is a solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ t3 ] ) with @xmath54 , the renormalized eos for symmetric nuclear matter evaluated up to second order is given by    @xmath67    note that the density  dependent term plays a crucial role in ensuring renormalization , but it gives in first order a contribution that can not be separated from that of the two  derivative terms with coefficients @xmath68 ; only at second order are @xmath68 and @xmath12 disentangled through their different contributions to loops . </S>",

    "<S> , we can recognize which terms should be added to the interaction to provide the same @xmath8 dependence in the eos : for the @xmath45 terms , one would need a two  body term of the type @xmath90 ; for the @xmath88 dependence a three  body term of the type @xmath91 ; and , finally , for the @xmath89 dependence , a four  body term @xmath92 .    </S>",

    "<S> the situation is familiar in field theory , where it is recognized that renormalization requires all possible interactions allowed by the symmetries . in this case , to have any predictive power one should be able to argue that some `` sub  leading '' terms should be included in first order only when `` leading '' terms are included in second order . for @xmath84 </S>",
