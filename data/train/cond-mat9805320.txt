    "can be most easily understood starting from the `` ionic '' ( @xmath167 ) limit of the model : for @xmath167 , the two electronic eigenstates of @xmath82 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 have the electron completely localized on site @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , with eigenenergies @xmath170 where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) , as shown by the two parabolic potential curves in fig .",

    "the two fully localized wavefunctions @xmath174 and @xmath176 become mixed , the electronic degeneracy at @xmath155 is lifted and a minimum excitation gap of @xmath180 opens up between the electronic ground- and 1st excited states .",
    "the sharp cusp at @xmath155 in the @xmath167 double - parabolic potential function @xmath181 [ see fig .  [ fig : double_well](a ) ] is rounded by the finite @xmath35 ; as a function of @xmath147 , the groundstate wavefunction @xmath182 now changes continuously at @xmath155 .",

    "by contrast , at the potential minimum @xmath155 in the regime @xmath191 , the electron charge is delocalized evenly between the two sites @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus , at the level of the 0th order adiabatic approximation ( i.e. , neglecting the lattice kinetic energy ) , the transition from the single - well potential case @xmath191 to the double - well case @xmath158 is essentially a transition from a delocalized non - degenerate groundstate ( @xmath155 ) to a localized degenerate groundstate ( @xmath159 ) . in the former case , the electron s delocalization energy dominates and it is energetically favorable for the electron wavefunction to be spread out between the two sites ;",
    "in the latter case , the ep coupling dominates and favors localizing the electron charge on only one of the two sites .",
    "the lattice spontaneously distorts so as to set up an attractive ep `` potential well '' which binds and localizes the electron .",
    "the electronic binding energy thus gained in turn stabilizes the local lattice distortion .",
    "this self - localization mechanism is the essence of polaron formation .",
    "localizing the electron on either one of the two sites is energetically equivalent due to the reflection symmetry ( @xmath192 ) of the underlying hamiltonian . at the level of the 0th order adiabatic approximation ,",
    "this symmetry is broken in the 2-fold degenerate 0th order groundstates @xmath159 .",
    "the existence of two _ degenerate _ local minima in @xmath154 can thus be understood as a direct consequence of the symmetry breaking which accompanies the self - localization transition . in the 1st order",
    "adiabatic approximation , the lattice kinetic energy restores this symmetry by inducing tunneling processes between the two potential minima , thus giving rise to a non - degenerate groundstate in which the two degenerate 0th order states are admixed with equal probability weight . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that such tunneling processes are accompanied by a transfer of electron charge between the two sites .",
    "these _ lattice _ tunneling processes , occurring within the ep - induced multiple - well born - oppenheimer potential , constitute the basic low - energy mechanism whereby self - localized electrons can move through the lattice . at higher temperatures , thermally activated over - the - barrier hopping will dominate the polaron transport @xcite which , again , can be described as a purely lattice dynamical phenomenon .",
    "thus , within the framework of the 1st order adiabatic approximation , polaron formation and polaron dynamics is fundamentally reduced to a problem of _ non - linear lattice _ dynamics .",
    "we now turn to the 1st order potential correction @xmath193 ( [ eq : w_1 - 2s ] ) in the two - site problem , shown for several values of @xmath194 in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_well](b ) . since @xmath131 ,",
    "according to ( [ eq : w_1 ] ) , is controlled by the @xmath81-gradient of the electron wavefunction @xmath125 , we should expect it to exhibit peaks wherever @xmath125 varies most rapidly with @xmath81 . in the two - site problem ,",
    "this occurs at @xmath155 where @xmath125 changes its character from being predominantly localized on site @xmath133 to being localized on site @xmath134 , as discussed above . for large @xmath195 ,",
    "@xmath182 approaches a constant , either @xmath174 or @xmath176 , hence @xmath196 for @xmath197 . in the polaron regime @xmath158 ,",
    "the primary effect of @xmath115 is to enhance the tunneling barrier separating the two potential minima .",
    "in addition , @xmath193 will also tend to shift the two polaronic potential minima further apart , thus causing the tunneling barrier to become wider than in the 0th order potential @xmath130 . both of these @xmath115-effects tend to suppress the tunneling rate through the barrier . even though @xmath198 may be small compared to the 0th order barrier height @xmath199 ( [ eq : delta_b0 ] ) , its effect on the polaron tunneling rates",
    "can be quantitatively of some importance , since tunneling rates are typically exponentially sensitive to changes in the tunneling barrier .    in the delocalized regime @xmath191 , the primary effect of @xmath115",
    "is to soften the harmonic restoring force constant @xmath200 by an amount @xmath201 thus , @xmath115 also lowers the critical @xmath33 for the on - set of polaron formation .",
    "however , in the large-@xmath22 limit where the adiabatic approximation is valid , that is , for @xmath202 ( see below ) , these corrections are smaller than the 0th order results ( [ eq : k_0- ] ,  [ eq : e_p - crit ] ) by factors of order @xmath203 .",
    "provided @xmath35 and @xmath33 are of comparable magnitude and @xmath204 ( see below ) , @xmath115 does not qualitatively alter the basic structure of the lattice potential @xmath205 in either coupling - strength regime .",
    "however , @xmath115 can become qualitatively important in suppressing certain non - adiabatic processes in lattice systems , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the basic criterion for the validity of the adiabatic approximation is that the longest time scale of the electronic motion should be short compared to the shortest time scale of the lattice motion or , equivalently , the lowest electronic frequency scale should be large compared to the highest lattice frequency scale . in the two - site problem ,",

    "it therefore remains to be seen whether metallic screening in a finite - density polaron liquid will be sufficient to `` rescue '' the af - driven pairing attraction from the repulsive long - range coulomb forces .",
    "it is also worth re - emphasizing @xcite the strong phonon contribution to the dielectric screening in the cuprates , as evidenced by the large measured dielectric constant ratio @xmath636@xcite .",
    "this phonon contribution , which acts to reduce long - range coulomb forces , can be equivalently regarded as a long - range attraction , mediated by long - range ( dipolar ) ep interactions .",
    "this long - range ep interaction is in fact a primary agent causing ( bi-)polaron formation in the above - cited @xcite phenomenological large - polaron models .",
    "it is therefore quite conceivable that , in a realistic model of the cuprates , both af- _ and _ ep - mediated attractions contribute to the overall pairing potential and that the ep contribution may even be the predominant one .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a treatment of polaron tunneling dynamics on the basis of a path integral formulation of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the adiabatic treatment of polaron tunneling has been tested by comparison to exact numerical results for a two - site holstein system .",
    "the break - down of the adiabatic approach in the anti - adiabatic regime has been discussed and the resulting limitations of applicability for long - range polaron tunneling processes in lattice models have been identified . using a combination of path integral ,",
    "many - body tight - binding and exact diagonalization techniques , we have then explored the berry phases and effective matrix elements for single- and two - polaron tunneling , the two - polaron quasiparticle statistics , effective two - polaron interactions , and polaron pairing states in the 2d holstein-@xmath0 and holstein - hubbard models near half filling .",
    "the effect of 2nd neighbor electron hybridization and long - range coulomb repulsion has also been studied . due to the af spin correlations , single - polaron hopping is dominated by _",
    "intra_-sublattice 2nd- and 3rd - neighbor processes .",
    "these processes are strongly enhanced by close proximity of a second polaron .",
    "the berry phases imply either @xmath428- or @xmath514-wave pair symmetries and effective spin-1/2-fermion quasiparticle statistics of dopant - induced polaron carriers . for the holstein-@xmath0 and holstein - hubbard models on the 8- , 10- , and 16-site clusters ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave state is stable for two polarons .",
    "the second neighbor hopping @xmath53 favors the @xmath1-wave pair for @xmath637 , while the long - range coulomb repulsion @xmath54 favor the @xmath514-wave pair .    the strong on - site hubbard-@xmath47 coulomb repulsion plays a crucial role in the formation of these pairing states . by keeping the electrons spatially separated and preventing on - site bi - polaron formation the hubbard-@xmath47 interaction acts , effectively , to greatly enhance the polaron tunneling bandwidths and , hence , their mobility , in the nearly @xmath386-filled regime .    for a hypothetical superconducting polaron pair condensate ,",
    "our results imply qualitative doping dependences of the isotope effect , @xmath573 and pseudo - gap which are similar to those observed in the cuprates .",
    "potential limitations of the present polaron model , arising from the short - range nature of the assumed ep coupling , have been pointed out .",
    "further studies to include longer - range ep couplings , in combination with extended coulomb interactions , have been outlined .",
