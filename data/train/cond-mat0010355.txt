    "competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting instabilities , seen in the cuprates , also appears in the @xmath0 compounds .    the hubbard model at half - filling on an anisotropic triangular lattice",
    "was proposed by mckenzie@xcite as a model of the conducting layers of @xmath0 .",
    "it is a simplification of a model first introduced by kino and fukuyama@xcite .",
    "two hopping matrix elements are considered , @xmath2 between sites on a square lattice and @xmath3 between next - nearest - neighbors along one of the two diagonal directions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tri ] ) .",
    "= 1.5 in    the case @xmath4 thus corresponds to the isotropic triangular lattice .",
    "the model interpolates between the square lattice ( @xmath5 ) , which has been the subject of many studies in the context of high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors and which has a spin - wave instability at half - filling , and completely decoupled chains ( @xmath6 ) for which we have an exact bethe ansatz solution by lieb and wu@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes nearest - neighbor pairs of sites on the square lattice and @xmath9 are next - nearest - neighbor pairs along one of the two diagonal directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] .",
    "values for the hopping amplitudes , obtained from several quantum chemistry calculations@xcite and for different anions @xmath10 , are in the range @xmath11 ; that is , somewhere between the square and the isotropic triangular lattices",
    ". the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized and the corresponding fermi surfaces at half - filling are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] .    in the next section we present results from a weak - coupling renormalization - group analysis on this model .",
    "we use the approach of zanchi and schulz@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface is divided into 16 patches .",
    "one - loop rg flow equations for all the possible scattering processes involving the patches on the fermi surface are numerically integrated towards the low - energy limit .",
    "all subleading non - logarithmic contributions , arising from six - point functions generated during the mode elimination , are included .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and make a comparison with results obtained in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the hubbard model on the pure square lattice ( @xmath5 ) and with repulsive on - site interaction @xmath12 has been extensively studied .",
    "weak - coupling renormalization - group analyses of the couplings , resolved into discrete patches along the fermi surface , have been performed@xcite . at half - filling , since the fermi surface is fully nested ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] ) , an antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin - wave instability develops . as the system is doped slightly away from half - filling , there is a crossover to a superconducting bcs regime and the dominant cooper pairing symmetry is @xmath13 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afxsc ] , we have reproduced these results@xcite .    introducing non - zero @xmath3 offers a",
    "_ different _ way of favoring a bcs instability over af .",
    "perfect nesting is eliminated once the hopping @xmath3 between next - nearest - neighbors sites along one of the two diagonal directions is turned on ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the square lattice where both af spin - wave and bcs couplings increase during the renormalization - group transformations with @xmath14 diverging faster than @xmath15 , for sufficiently large @xmath3 there is a crossover to a regime where the bcs processes eventually dominate , signaling a superconducting instability .",
    "furthermore , because the fermi surface is imperfectly nested , the growth in both types of couplings weakens . further increasing @xmath3",
    "eventually destroys the nesting of the fermi surface altogether and both types of divergences are suppressed .",
    "three cases illustrating these crossovers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : afxsc_t2 ] .",
    "going further to the isotropic point , our weak - coupling rg analysis no longer shows bcs instabilities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : afxsc_tri ] the dominant af and bcs channels are compared .",
    "neither channel shows strong divergences , but the af channel is significantly larger than the bcs channel .",
    "slave - boson calculations@xcite find a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition to occur at the relatively large value of @xmath16 , but also find a metallic phase with incommensurate spiral order@xcite at @xmath17 .",
    "our weak - coupling results seem to indicate the onset of re - entrant long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "af ordering tendencies again disappear as @xmath3 is increased further , beyond @xmath2 .",
    "this is as expected , since decoupled hubbard chains do not exhibit af order .",
    "hubbard models on the square lattice have been extensively studied in the context of high-@xmath1 superconductivity . we have reproduced the well - known result that there is an af instability at half - filling . also doping the system away from half filling",
    "induces a crossover to a bcs regime with @xmath13 pairing symmetry , as expected .",
    "more importantly , we have shown another way of triggering a bcs instability . keeping the system at half - filling , but introducing the diagonal hopping @xmath3 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] ) , eliminates perfect nesting .",
    "corresponding magnetic frustration kills the spin density wave , and cooper pairing can dominate .",
    "this result suggests that superconductivity may occur in a model of strongly - correlated electrons that interpolates between the square and isotropic triangular lattices .    at the isotropic point",
    ", there are signs of re - entrant antiferromagnetic long range order . in the large-@xmath18 limit , at half - filling",
    ", the hubbard model can of course be mapped to the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet which is known to have long - range af order on the triangular lattice .",
    "furthermore , away from the isotropic point , our weak - coupling rg analysis continues to agree qualitatively with results obtained for the pure heisenberg system with two exchange couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the phase diagram of the heisenberg model has been studied via a straight @xmath21 expansion@xcite , series expansion methods@xcite , and a large - n treatment@xcite .",
    "all three methods find two regions of long - range order : near the limit of a square lattice ( @xmath22 ) and near the isotropic point ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that our weak - coupling analysis agrees with these results ."
