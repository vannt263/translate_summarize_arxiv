    "after these transmissions , bob can act on the quantum channel reconstructing a perfect replica of @xmath0 , while the original alice s state is destroyed during the process ( as a direct consequence of the no - cloning theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the net result of the teleportation is the removal of @xmath0 from alice s side and its appearance in bob s side some time later , just the time needed by a classical message to go from alice to bob .",
    "the depicted general protocol for quantum teleportation is based on a fundamental ingredient : the quantum channel which  is shared by the two parties .",
    "it consists in a bipartite state @xmath1 of two distant systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , possessed by alice and bob , respectively , and whose correlations are exploited to teleport the input state .",
    "this is possible by mixing the input state with the quantum channel at alice s side ( system @xmath2 ) via a suitable collective measurement , called _ bell measurement _ , whose projective effect causes the flow of quantum information to system @xmath3 via the long - range correlations .",

    "if now alice communicates to bob the exact outcome of her measurement , bob can consequently apply the right unitary transformation on qubit @xmath3 which retrieves the original input state .",
    "this is the classical part of the protocol , i.e. , the remaining information about the input state is represented by two bits of classical information which are produced by the measurement process .",
    "exactly this amount of information has to be communicated from alice to bob through a classical channel in order to transmit the complete information about @xmath15 and therefore complete the teleportation process .     to bob . to accomplish this task",

    "such connections have been shown for particular cases , since they are not known in general and they are currently object of investigation .    as a generalization of cv quantum teleportation",
    ", we have approached the study of cv quantum teleportation networks , where three or more users share a multimode state and quantum teleportation between an arbitrary pair of users can be assisted or non - assisted by all the other parties . here , assisted protocols have been proved to outperform non - assisted ones , provided that a suitable set of loccs are performed by the assisting parties .",

    "we have attempted to address this problem in the case of a three - mode teleportation network , where the performance of quantum teleportation between alice and bob conditioned to a local measurement and classical communication by charlie has been analyzed .",
