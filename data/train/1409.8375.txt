    "in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , the geometry of the initial overlap region is reflected in the final momentum space distributions of produced particles  @xcite .",
    "how much that geometry is translated into the final state distributions is used to infer information about the properties of the matter created in the collision fireball like its viscosity  @xcite . the initial geometry plays a particularly important role in interpreting the data and in extracting the viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath11 .",
    "it is important therefore to understand the initial conditions including the exact shape of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the inference of the properties of the fireball from data is hindered by uncertainties in the characteristics of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "recently collisions between uranium nuclei ( @xmath12u ) which have an intrinsic prolate shape  @xcite , have been used as a way to manipulate this initial geometry in order better test our understanding of the initial state of heavy ion collisions and the subsequent fireball  @xcite .",
    "an important part of describing the initial conditions is to correctly model the geometry of the incoming nuclei . for many years in simulations for heavy ion collisions ,",
    "nuclei were approximated as smooth density distributions and the only anisotropies considered in the initial state were the intrinsic almond shape caused by the overlap of two spherical nuclei .",
    "as the accumulation of rhic data gradually demonstrated that final state anisotropies were sensitive to the initial geometry and its fluctuations , it became necessary to take into account the lumpiness of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is done through monte - carlo simulations ( m - c ) where each nucleus is generated with a finite number of nucleons distributed with a density @xmath13 described by a woods - saxon distribution  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density at the center of the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear radius @xmath0 and skin depth @xmath1 are commonly taken from high - energy electron scattering measurements  @xcite . for",
    "non - spherical nuclei , this description was extended by introducing spherical harmonics in the woods - saxon distribution to describe the modulation of the nuclear radius with @xmath16  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath4 and @xmath18 are the deformation parameters .",
    "@xmath4 is often derived from measurements of the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability b(e2)@xmath5 from the 0@xmath19 ground state to the first 2@xmath19 state  @xcite according to the formula : @xmath20 @xmath0 is taken to be 1.2a@xmath21 .",
    "the b(e2)@xmath5 values are directly measured experimental quantities , but the derivation of @xmath4 from b(e2)@xmath5 is usually done with model dependent assumptions including the assumption that the nuclear charge distribution is a hard edged , step - function rather than a woods - saxon distribution . in order to check for consistency with the measured b(e2)@xmath5 values , one can vary the @xmath4 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defws ] ) and then calculate the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the resulting nucleus : @xmath22 and check to ensure that @xmath23 is consistent with the measured b(e2)@xmath5 according to the approximation  @xcite : @xmath24 this procedure ensures that the deformation of the simulated nucleus is consistent with the measured b(e2)@xmath5 values for the given model describing the density profile of the nucleus .",
    "another difficulty in characterizing deformed nuclei comes from a mismatch between the parameters inferred from electron scattering experiments and the woods - saxon parameters used in the simulation of the nuclear density profile .",
    "electron scattering experiments probe the spherical part of the density distribution ( characterized by radius @xmath8 and diffuseness @xmath1 ) , which is averaged over all orientations of the nucleus .",
    "if the nucleus is not spherical , then the @xmath8 and @xmath1 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defws ] ) will not necessarily correspond to the average radius and average diffuseness inferred from the electron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is important to calculate the @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 values that when used in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ eq : defws ] ) yield a nucleus that is consistent with the experimental measurements of b(e2)@xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we present updated @xmath8 and @xmath1 for nuclei commonly used in collisions at rhic or the lhc , @xmath12u , @xmath25pb and @xmath26au , as well as @xmath4 value for @xmath12u .",
    "we then show calculations of the second and third harmonic participant eccentricity @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the new and old parameters .",
    "we find that in addition to the obvious dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath4 , the ratio of @xmath27 is very sensitive to the diffuseness parameter @xmath1 : @xmath10 increases with increasing @xmath1 while @xmath9 decreases so that @xmath27 is overestimated if @xmath1 is overestimated . since viscous damping decreases the ratio of triangular flow over elliptic flow ( @xmath28 ) , an overestimate of @xmath27 will lead to an over - estimate of the amount of viscous damping needed to match the experimental data .",
    "we find therefore that the new values of @xmath1 presented in this work should lead to a decrease in the value of @xmath11 inferred from model - to - data comparisons .",
    "when using a woods - saxon distribution with parameters @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 to characterize the density distribution of a deformed nucleus , it is obvious that after allowing for all possible rotations of the nucleus , the averaged density distribution will still be accurately described by a woods - saxon distribution .",
    "we find however , that for the range of @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 values describing typical nuclei , the final density distribution after averaging over all appropriate rotations is indeed well described by a woods - saxon distribution but with a different radius @xmath29 and diffuseness @xmath30 . to accurately model a nucleus",

    "it s worth mentioning that the m - c glauber simulation for the collision of two nuclei does not typically distinguish neutrons and protons , so we assume both neutrons and protons follow the same woods - saxon distribution in the form of eq .",

    "a relatively larger radius @xmath0 and a smaller diffuseness @xmath1 for the finite - size scenario is needed to reproduce the woods - saxon distribution inferred from electron scattering measurements .",

    "this behavior can be traced to the smaller value of @xmath1 in the new parameter set . in non - central collisions ,",

    "using the correct value of the diffuseness parameter when modeling heavy ion collision is crucial especially when calculating @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the azimuth angle of each particle relative to the major axis of the third harmonic event anisotropy . since the relationship of @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 similarly defined are often used to estimate the viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath11 , estimates of @xmath11 from model - to - data comparisons can be adversely affected if the model does not use the correct woods - saxon parameters .",
