    "at a distance of only 8 kpc  @xcite , the galactic center presents a unique opportunity to study in exquisite detail a supermassive black hole and its interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "extensive observations of the inner 3 parsecs of the galaxy have revealed an extremely complicated , highly interacting region . found within these inner parsecs",

    "the cnd was first detected by @xcite as double - lobed emission at @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; it has subsequently been observed extensively at radio to infrared wavelengths ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these observations indicate that the cnd is a ring - like structure of molecular gas and dust with an inclination of @xmath12 and a position angle of  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the ring is nearly complete in  but has noticeable gaps , especially to the north  @xcite .",
    "the inner radius of the cnd is well - defined at @xmath14  pc ( deprojected ) .",
    "early single dish observations traced , co , and  out to more than 7 pc  @xcite , but a recent interferometric study suggests an outer edge at 3 - 4 pc  @xcite .",
    "the cnd has a thickness of @xmath15  pc at the inner edge  @xcite and may expand to 2 pc at larger distances from  @xcite .",
    "cnd kinematics are consistent with rotation at 110  @xcite with deviations in some regions , most notably to the west",
    ". these deviations are consistent with a warped disk created from the collision of two large clouds  @xcite or a ring of multiple dynamically distinct streamers  @xcite .    to understand the behavior of the cnd in the complexity of the galactic center , and in particular to evaluate its stability , lifetime , and potential for star formation , it is critical to constrain the physical conditions of the cnd molecular gas .",
    "previous observations have found a total mass within the cnd of only @xmath1  @xmath16  m@xmath17  @xcite and indicated densities of @xmath1  @xmath18  -  @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "these densities are sufficiently low that the gas cores would be unstable to tidal disruption from  and the central stellar population .",
    "however ,  @xcite calculate densities within the cnd cores of 10@xmath7  -  @xmath20  from models of the  emission , noting that such densities would significantly increase the expected core lifetime .",
    "they do point out that modeling of other molecular and atomic tracers yields lower densities in keeping with the values of  @xcite . here",
    "we present new observations of the cnd in  and  at a resolution of 5.1  @xmath0  2.7 , a factor of 2 - 3 gain in spatial resolution over previous studies . with this enhanced resolution",
    ", we resolve substantial core structure within the cnd and calculate typical core densities of @xmath21  -  @xmath20  , in agreement with the results of  @xcite .",

    "the observations described here were taken from 1999 november to 2000 april at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array .",
    "we obtained 10 tracks in four configurations ( table  [ tab : tracks ] ) , resulting in a naturally - weighted synthesized beam fwhm of @xmath23 .",
    "the observations used a 10 pointing mosaic to cover a @xmath24  ( @xmath25 ) region centered on .",

    "we simultaneously imaged the  and  transitions in the upper sideband at 88.63 and 89.19 ghz , respectively .  and  are both tracers of high density ( @xmath29-@xmath19  ) molecular gas and are therefore ideal molecules for probing the dense cnd cores",
    ". each line was observed in 64 channels of 2 mhz ( 6.8  ) width centered on v@xmath30  .",
    "the total velocity range was -213 to 206  , easily covering the -150 to 150  region where emission was detected in previous observations .",
    "in addition , we obtained a single track in the l configuration of the h@xmath31cn line at 86.34 ghz .",
    "we observed the two pointings covering the northeastern and southwestern emission lobes of the cnd and used these observations to estimate the  optical depth ( @xmath32 ) for the cnd (  [ sec : cmass ] ) .",
    "a bright quasar was observed twice in each track for passband and flux calibration .",
    "the quasar fluxes , derived from comparisons with observations of uranus and neptune in nearby tracks , varied slowly over the six months of the observation by as much as 20% ( table  [ tab : tracks ] ) , but this variation was accounted for in the individual flux calibration of each track .",
    "we estimate a total uncertainty in the flux measurements of @xmath1  10% .",
    "nrao 530 was observed every 15 minutes for gain calibration , and based on the nrao 530 observations , periods of low coherence on each baseline were removed .",
    "all of the calibration and editing was done with mma  @xcite , while all cleaning and mapping used the miriad software package  @xcite .",
    "the dominant noise in these interferometer images is misplaced flux of bright emission peaks resulting from residual atmospheric and instrumental phase fluctuations . using the strong signal from the continuum source and the closure phase relationship ( see  @xcite ) ,",
    "the random phase fluctuations are corrected .",
    "such iterative phase self - calibration was performed on the five pointings containing  in the primary beam ( diameter  @xmath33 for 89 ghz ) using line free channels to produce the continuum model by cleaning down to the first negative clean component .",
    "the continuum model is dominated by point source emission from .",
    "the typical time interval for self - calibration was 30 minutes , corresponding to the period between repetitions of the same map position .",
    "the self - calibration reduced the noise in the images by 20 - 30@xmath34 and increased the total recovered flux for by @xmath35  50% . since the self - calibration was based on line - free channels and contained only in the model , the cnd emission line fluxes were increased negligibly by the self - calibration ( typically by only 5% with a maximum increase of 15% ) .",
    "as noted above , the self - calibration was used to reduced the noise due to mis - calibrated and/or scattered flux of .",
    "therefore , the lack of self - calibration on the five positions at the northern and southern edges of the field without  in the primary beam did not significantly affect our determination of the cnd line flux .",
    "the 10 pointings were mosaicked in the uv plane using the miriad invert command with the `` systemp '' option , which gives low statistical weights to visibilities with high system temperatures .",
    "the maps were cleaned to a 1.5@xmath36  level in each individual channel using miriad routine mossdi2 , which is designed for mosaicked observations and cleans to a given level of the theoretical noise at each point in a mosaic rather than to a set flux level . we then subtracted the 85.91 ghz continuum map ( fig .",

    ", our map contains 5.38 jy of continuum emission , compared with 8.9 jy from  @xcite .",
    "this difference is likely due to the shorter baselines available in the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) data , which enable detection of a greater fraction of the spatially extended components of the thermal emission .",
    "tracing recovered flux as a function of distance from , we find very little additional flux recovered in apertures larger than 30 - 40 .",
    "nobeyama 45-m single dish observations  @xcite , free of the missing short spacings problem , likewise observe little emission beyond a 30 - 40  radius from  and measure 27 jy within 60@xmath40 of  @xcite , compared with @xmath41  jy from our observations , suggesting we recover @xmath1  20% of the total 3 mm continuum flux .",
    "absorption by molecular gas along the line of sight to the galactic center can significantly effect the observed  and  emission at some velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig : sgraspectrum ] shows  and  spectra extracted from a 4  diameter region centered on .",
    "both spectra show broad absorption from -80  to + 70  from galactic center gas and narrower absorption features at -135 , -50 , and -30  due to foreground galactic arms at radii of 250 pc  @xcite , 3 kpc  @xcite , and 4 kpc  @xcite respectively .",
    "although the velocities of the  and  absorption features are generally similar , the  absorption is deeper than that of the  at -135  and 20  -  40  .",
    "these deeper  features suggest regions of lower density gas along the line of sight where the fractional abundance of  has been enhanced because of deeper penetration by cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "the integrated  and  intensity maps ( figs .  [ fig : hcnmoment0 ] and  [ fig : hcomoment0 ] ) clearly show a ring - like cnd with a gap in emission to the north of  and reduced emission to the east .",
    "the overall cnd gas distribution is similar to that seen in previous imaging , but these observations detect more significant emission to the east of  and because of the enhanced spatial resolution reveal much greater internal structure within the cnd ring .",
    "the  flux is on average 2 - 3 times the  flux ( see  [ sec : hcnvshco ] ) .",
    "the cnd flux distribution as a function of distance from  ( deprojected assuming an inclination angle of 60 ) has a sharp inner edge at 40@xmath40  ( 1.6 pc ) , an equally steep decline around 50@xmath40  ( 2.0 pc ) , followed by a slowly declining , non - zero flux out past 150@xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxversusdistance ] ) .",
    "the sharp inner and outer edges strongly suggest the cnd has a ring - like morphology  @xcite . despite its ring - like nature",
    ", we nevertheless maintain the traditional nomenclature of circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) .",
    "channel maps of the  and  emission binned in 27  ( four channel ) intervals are shown in figures  [ fig : hcnchannels ] and  [ fig : hcochannels ] .",
    "the rotation of the cnd is clearly evident , as the dominant negative velocity emission arises southwest of  and loops around to the northeast of , where the emission is primarily at positive velocities .",
    "the channel maps also clearly show locations with multiple velocity components .",
    "perhaps the most prominent example is 20@xmath40  west and 20@xmath40  south of , where significant emission is seen around @xmath42  and 70  -  100  .",
    "the rotation of the cnd is additionally apparent in the flux - weighted average velocity map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : momentone ] ) .",
    "the velocity structure is continuous around the ring with the greatest negative ( approaching ) velocity near the southwestern emission lobe and the greatest positive ( receding ) velocity near the northeastern emission lobe .",
    "the sharp velocity gradient along the western side of the cnd is a result of the spatial coincidence of -50  and 70 - 110  emission and the presence of strong absorption at velocities near 0  .",
    "the region to the east of  has a velocity near 0  and also suffers from large amounts of absorption , which explains the reduction in observed emission .",
    "we note that the primary velocities expected in the northern gap ( @xmath43 ) do not suffer from severe line of sight absorption , thereby suggesting a true dearth of molecular emission in the northern gap .",
    "the /  abundance ratio is  @xmath1  1 for typical galactic molecular clouds  @xcite .",
    "previous observations of the cnd found that the  emission traces the same regions as the  emission , but with /  as low as 0.06 - 0.2  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the integrated maps ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hcnmoment0 ] and  [ fig : hcomoment0 ] ) , the relative strength of  versus  emission in our observations is largely consistent with these previous measurements . for locations with @xmath37 emission in both  and , the mean /  ratio is 0.74 .",
    "however , this result is misleading because we are only considering points with 3@xmath36 emission in both tracers .",
    "there are almost 3 times as many locations with @xmath37  emission without 3@xmath36  emission as there are locations with 3@xmath36  emission and @xmath44  emission .",
    "therefore , the true _ average _",
    "/  emission ratio is significantly lower . comparing the ratio of total  to total  emission in each channel",
    ", we find a typical channel /  ratio of 0.4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnhcoratio ] ) .    examining the variation of the /  ratio with velocity we find that the lowest ratios are found in the channels corresponding to the northeastern and southwestern emission lobes of the cnd with the highest ratios around 0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnhcoratio ] ) .",
    "this region of enhanced  emission relative to the  emission corresponds roughly to the broad absorption trough around 0  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sgraspectrum ] ) . while there are velocity ranges in which  absorption on  is more significant than  absorption , especially around -140  and 20 - 40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sgraspectrum ] ) , the /  ratio in these regions is neither significantly enhanced nor reduced from the values in surrounding channels , suggesting that the differential line of sight absorption between  and  does not significantly affect the analysis of the /  ratio in each channel . as we will see in  [ sec : coreproperties ] , the southwestern and northeastern lobes include some of the most massive cores , while cores in our sample that are found at velocities around 0  tend to be the least massive .",
    "this suggests a trend where the lowest /  ratios correspond to high mass regions while the highest /  ratios are found in the lower mass regions .",
    "we estimate the mass of each core ( see  [ sec : masses ] ) in three independent ways .",
    "two of these techniques do have a dependence upon the level of the  emission ( or the abundance of  relative to h@xmath3 ) , which potentially biases us towards high mass cores in regions with high  flux ( and thus low /  ratios ) .",
    "however , the third tracer , requiring an assumption that the cores are virialized , is independent of the observed  flux ( and as we shall see provides density and mass estimates in good agreement with estimates from assuming the cores to be optically thick to  emission ) , thus strengthening the support for the correlation of low /  ratios in high mass regions .",
    "this correlation could result from the cnd having enhanced hcn emission in more massive regions because of increased shock processing of the gas ( perhaps in core - core collisions ) .",
    "alternatively , if the lower mass regions have less shielding from cosmic ray ionization than do high mass regions , the fractional ionization rate would be higher in the low mass regions , leading to an enhanced  abundance relative to  @xcite",
    ".    one significant region of  emission without significant  emission is the linear filament , the swath of  emission approximately 20  west and 35  north of  ( see location in fig .  [",
    "fig : h2hcn ] ) .",
    "we discuss this feature in more detail below (  [ sec : h2emission ] ) and argue that the  abundance may be enhanced relative to  because of shocks in the linear filament .",
    "in contrast , there is a single region where  emission dominates that of . between 17 and 30  in a region centered at 45  east and 5  south of",
    ", the median /  ratio is 1.22 .",
    "the molecular gas cores found within this region tend to be some of the lowest mass and density cores in the cnd , supporting the argument of higher  abundance relative to  in lower mass and density regions due to enhanced cosmic ray ionization .      in figure",
    "[ fig : h2hcn ] we overlay our integrated  emission map in contours upon a gray - scale image of the h@xmath3  ( 1 - 0 ) s(1 ) emission at 2.12@xmath4 m from  @xcite .",
    "h@xmath3 can be excited by shocks or uv fluorescence .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is most prominent in the cnd in the northeastern and southwestern lobes ( as a likely result of limb brightening ) where the integrated  emission is also the greatest .",
    "@xcite argue that the most likely excitation sources for the h@xmath3 emission in the cnd are uv radiation or the dissipation of energy from collisions of dense molecular gas cores within the cnd .",
    "this core collision mechanism requires core densities of @xmath45  , confirmed by our density measurements below (  [ sec : mass ] ) .",
    "core collisions and/or shocks could also create regions with low /  ratios , as shocks can help fuel  emission and additionally increase  abundance relative to  @xcite .",
    "the linear filament is strongly detected in h@xmath3 emission with two primary emission peaks coincident with two  cores ( cores x and y in fig .",
    "[ fig : corelocator ] below ) .",
    "this feature is extremely narrow in h@xmath3 ( @xmath11 ) and contains an oh maser near the northern end .",
    "the emission may arise from shocks generated by the supernova shell of sgr a east hitting the 50  molecular cloud  @xcite .",
    "such shocks may explain the extremely low /  ratio in the linear filament .",
    "a similar situation exists for the outer filament , which begins at the northern end of the cnd northern arm .",
    "weak  emission is seen coincident with the h@xmath3 emission of the outer filament , but there is no accompanying  emission .",
    "we note that this emission is weaker and does not appear in contours in the integrated emission  map in figure  [ fig : h2hcn ] but peaks around 10 - 15  w , 90  n. in addition , the outer filament coincides spatially and kinematically ( peaking around 50  ) with [ siii ] emission at 34.8 @xmath4 m  @xcite .",
    "the [ siii ] emission and the  emission without accompanying  flux both suggest a shock excitation mechanism for h@xmath3 .",
    "two additional regions of good spatial agreement between the h@xmath3 and  are the northeastern and southern extensions .",
    "both of these regions are unshielded from the radiation of the central stellar cavity , suggesting that the h@xmath3 emission is caused by uv excitation .",
    "we discuss the northeastern extension in greater detail in section  [ sec : ionized ] .",
    "to understand the relationship of the cnd to the ionized minispiral , we utilized two maps of the ionized emission .",
    "the first , a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ nicmos pa@xmath46 map  @xcite has an exquisite spatial resolution of 0.2 .",
    "the second , a very large array ( vla ) h92@xmath46 radio recombination line map  @xcite combines 1  spatial resolution with 14  spectral resolution to provide kinematic detail of the inner parsecs .",
    "figure  [ fig : hcnmoment0 ] shows our integrated  emission map in contours on the color - scale pa@xmath46 image . the most obvious interaction is along the minispiral s western arc , where the ionized gas is consistently immediately interior to the cnd .",
    "the western arc has been suggested as the inner edge of the cnd , ionized by the strong uv radiation field of the stars in the central cluster  @xcite .",
    "we confirm this relationship kinematically through examining the velocity centroids of the ionized and molecular emission along the western arc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h92hcnwesternarc ] ) .",
    "the velocities are in close agreement , particularly at a position angle of approximately  -145 , at which both the  and h92@xmath46  emission peak . while some overlap between the western arc and the cnd exists , the ionized emission always lies interior to the peak  emission .",
    "the high column densities that we measure for the  emission along the western side of the cnd correspond to visual extinctions of up to 700 magnitudes  @xcite , suggesting that in regions where the ionized emission observed in pa@xmath46 overlaps the cnd emission , the ionized emission must lie near the foreground side of the molecular gas .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig : hcnmoment0 ] suggests that the peak emission from the northern arm of the minispiral may connect with the northeastern extension from the cnd at @xmath1  5  e , 20  n. the enhanced spatial resolution of our observations reveals the northeast extension to be a longer and more sharply collimated feature than previously observed .",
    "the strong collimation in the molecular and ionized gas can be explained by pressure of mass - loss winds from emission - line stars in the inner parsec  @xcite . at the intersection between the northern arm and the northeastern extension the velocities are in remarkable agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h92hcnnorthernarm ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the northernmost parts of the northern arm appear to bend to the west slightly after meeting the northeastern extension and pass through the northern gap in the cnd , and based on an increase in cnd linewidths on either side of the northern gap and the presence of an oh maser within the gap  @xcite ,  @xcite suggest that the minispiral northern arm is infalling and creates the gap as it pushes through the cnd . a definite conclusion on the relationship between the northern arm and the cnd",
    "is not possible with these observations , but our improved spatial resolution allows us to suggest for the first time that the northeastern extension and the northern arm may be part of a single , highly collimated feature .",
    "the enhanced spatial resolution of our  and  observations resolves a great deal of internal gas structure within the cnd , enabling us to analyze the molecular gas properties there using techniques similar to those used to derive the properties of galactic giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and their cloud cores .      from the  maps we have identified 26 bright , isolated emission features , each a dense molecular gas core within the cnd .",
    "these features , labeled a - z , are marked in figure  [ fig : corelocator ] .",
    "we required that each core included in this analysis be isolated in both position and velocity space from other emission peaks down to at least 50% of the peak emission for the core .",
    "included in this sample are the vast majority of the brightest emission cores that met our requirements for isolation , as well as a number of lower emission level cores ; however , we do not claim completeness to any particular flux level but rather intend the sample to be representative of the range of bright cores found within the cnd .",
    "some peaks in the integrated  emission map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnmoment0 ] ) , such as that 10  west of core f , are too close spatially and kinematically and thus are not included in our core sample",
    ". there are additional emission cores at larger distances from  ( e.g. , 5  w , 80  n in fig .  [ fig : momentone ] ) , but we restricted our sample to cores contained in the main cnd emission .. in table  [ tab : clumpproperties ] we detail the properties of the 26 cores , including location , size , velocity center and fwhm , and mass and density estimates .",
    "each of these core properties is discussed in greater detail below .",
    "for each of the cores , position - velocity strip maps were generated in the north - south and east - west directions to use for measurements of core size and velocity width .",
    "in addition , the strip maps allowed us to reduce line of sight blending and separate multiple kinematic components ( such as core pairs k / l and s / t ) . examples of these position - velocity maps are given in figure  [ fig : pvcuts ] for cores b , i , j , o , and v. in each of these plots we indicate the adopted half - power size and velocity fwhm estimates by the dashed lines .",
    "the measured apparent size fwhms were deconvolved for the instrumental spatial resolution ( beamsize ) using the gaussian approximation ( i.e. @xmath47 ) .",

    "to deproject , we assumed an inclination angle of 60  for the cnd  @xcite . the median and mean deprojected core distances are 1.67 pc and 1.80 pc respectively , and the distribution of the 26 core distances follows very closely the deprojected flux distribution found in figure  [ fig : fluxversusdistance ]",

    "this velocity separation is on the order of the width of each channel ( 6.8  ) .",
    "we modeled the increase in measured velocity fwhm due to the hyperfine structure , as well as the instrumental velocity resolution ( taken to be one channel width ) and found it to be a minor effect for velocity fwhms @xmath51  but substantial for smaller widths .",
    "the simulations were used to correct the measured velocity widths of the cnd cores .",
    "we find median and mean velocity fwhms for the 26 cores of 28.1  and 26.1  respectively , corresponding to approximately 4 channels in our observations .",
    "it should be noted that the 1:5:3 intensity ratio of the three  hyperfine lines was derived for optically thin emission and so may not be the exact ratio applicable in this situation , because the  emission is optically thick .",
    "however , comparison with linewidths measured from our  observations for a smaller sample of cores suggests that the linewidths measured from the  emission and contained in table  [ tab : clumpproperties ] are in agreement with the  linewidths to within 15 - 20% .",
    "we use three independent approaches to estimate or constrain the masses of the molecular gas cores in the cnd : virial estimates assuming the cores are gravitationally bound , an optically thick estimate obtained by integrating the gas column density over the projected area of each core , and a lower limit obtained under the assumptions that the  in the cores is optically thin and the contribution from shocks to the  flux is minimal .",
    "each of these approaches has its own limitations ( eg . the cores may not be in virial equilibrium and the hcn to h@xmath52 abundance ratio is very poorly known for the cnd ) .",
    "in addition , the optically thin and optically thick estimates are affected by the uncertainty in the role that shock processing plays in producing the observed  emission .",
    "shocks , particularly from core - core collisions , could substantially enhance the hcn abundance and hence the observed hcn flux per unit mass of gas .",
    "if the true hcn abundance is in fact enhanced , our estimates of the core masses and densities under both the optically thin and optically thick assumptions would be overestimated .",
    "the optically thin calculations therefore can be considered a lower limit to the core mass and density only under the assumption that the shock contribution to the  emission is negligible .    keeping in mind these assumptions and their possible effects",
    ", we find that the virial and optically thick methods yield substantially higher masses and densities for the cnd than previously derived from lower resolution  imaging .",
    "virial mass estimates for the cores were computed from the measured sizes and velocity widths using @xmath53 where r@xmath54 is the radius ( pc ) of the core ( taken as the geometric mean of the deconvolved half widths in the north - south and east - west directions ) and @xmath55 is the velocity line - width ( fwhm ) in .",
    "we model the core as a uniform density sphere , introducing the factor of  @xmath56 in eq .",
    "[ eq : virial ] .",
    "the core masses can also be estimated by integrating the molecular gas column densities over the surface area of each core .",
    "the optical depth of the observed hcn emission can be estimated from the observed flux ratio of  and h@xmath31cn emission . using the lowest resolution but highest signal - to - noise ratio data ( l configuration tracks in table  [ tab : tracks ] ) of the  line and the additional l configuration observation of the h@xmath31cn line we obtain a mean  optical depth ( @xmath57 )  of 4 for the southwestern and northeastern cnd emission lobes ( assuming a @xmath58 isotopic ratio of 30 for the galactic center ) .",

    "this value has been derived for a number of high density cores in galactic gmcs @xcite and also for the cnd by  @xcite from analysis of multi - transition hcn observations .",

    "however ,  @xcite considered only t@xmath75 , compared with 50 k adopted here based on the cnd dust emission .",
    "previous works have taken a wide range of values for t@xmath60 from 20 - 450 k ( see table 2 of  @xcite ) , although most atomic and molecular studies have taken a value of t@xmath76  100 k. since the derived column densities and masses scale as t@xmath77  x@xmath78 , adoption of the higher hcn abundance and the higher t@xmath60 by  @xcite largely offset each other in their effect on the derived masses .",
    "shock processing of the molecular gas would also increase the value of @xmath72 , leading to an overestimate of the core masses .",

    "we note that  @xcite estimated virial masses for a sample of nine cores in the cnd based on separate @xmath89  ovro  imaging range from @xmath90  to @xmath91  , similar to our virial mass estimates .",
    "the close similarity between the virial and  mass distributions ( fig .",

    "similarly ,  @xcite find virial densities of @xmath95 to @xmath96  for their sample of nine cnd cores . as we will discuss later , the high densities of our large core sample have important implications for core stability in the tidal field of  and for the possible role of these cores in the formation of stars in the inner parsecs .",
    "a final independent check on our mass and density estimates of the cnd is provided by millimeter and sub - millimeter dust emission measurements from the cnd  @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected the cnd dust at @xmath97 mm .",
    "after subtracting substantial radio continuum from the ionized gas , they estimate a total mass of cold dust ( at 20 k ) and gas @xmath98  in the northeastern and southwestern cnd lobes . in 450",

    "however , mass estimates based on observed dust emission require assumptions for the dust opacity coefficient and dust - to - gas abundance ratio  both of which could be quite different in the high density cnd  and the assumption that the dust was optically thin at 450  @xmath4 m .",
    "we note that the typical densities and sizes estimated in table 2 for the cores yield typical mass column densities of 50 to 100 gr @xmath101 . for standard dust properties and abundances  @xcite ,",
    "these column densities imply optical depths of @xmath102 at 450@xmath4 m .",
    "thus the observed 450@xmath4 m fluxes may considerably underestimate the cnd mass because of opacity effects .",
    "our 3 mm continuum maps show no evidence of dust emission associated with the cnd molecular gas cores , but this is below our detection limit even for the very high column densities estimated above .",
    "one factor that could affect our measurements of the core masses and densities is the resolving out of substantial extended  flux .",
    "however , we compared our  maps to nobeyama 45 m  observations  @xcite and find that for the cnd lobes we recover @xmath103% of the total  flux .",
    "the tidal shear on cnd cores from the gravitational potential of  and the central stellar population is extremely large .",
    "the total mass enclosed as a function of galactic radius ( l ) can be modeled as :    @xmath104    this expression for total enclosed mass is taken from  @xcite and modified to account for new measurements of the mass of  @xcite .    therefore the mean internal density required for a core to be tidally stable is :    @xmath105    we list the minimum densities for tidal stability ( @xmath106 ) for each core in table  [ tab : clumpproperties ] .",
    "the mean value is @xmath107 @xmath94 .    comparing the calculated core densities with the minimum densities required for tidal stability",
    ", we find that the vast majority of cores are dense enough to be tidally stable .",
    "indeed , all 26 cores have  densities sufficient for tidal stability , and 23 of the 26 cores have sufficient virial densities .",
    "we note that there is no correlation between measured core densities and deprojected distance from  and that the virial and  densities are often 3 - 5 times greater than the minimal tidal stability density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coredensities ] ) .",
    "this is strong observational support for widespread tidal stability and virial equilibrium within the cnd cores because if the cores were being tidally disrupted , their _ apparent _ virial densities would always approach the tidal stability limit as the cores gradually become tidally stripped .",
    "the core densities that we measure for the cnd are not only substantially higher than previous estimates but also on average 3 - 5 times larger than necessary for tidal stability .",
    "thus the lifetime of the cnd cores may be considerably longer than their internal dynamical timescales of @xmath108 yrs .",
    "the ionized gas within the minispiral has been estimated at 100  @xcite .",

    "estimates for the infall time of the ionized material are  @xmath112  yr  @xcite . if even 10% of the molecular gas in the cnd ultimately fell into the central parsec and became the ionized material now visible in the minispiral , the mass ratio between the cnd and the minispiral and the minispiral infall time argue for a typical lifetime for the material in the cnd of  @xmath113 .",
    "this time frame is a factor of 10 - 100 larger than previous estimates and is also much longer than the dynamical / orbital time for the cnd .",
    "the neutral , atomic gas contained in the inner parsec has been estimated at 300 m@xmath114  @xcite . the bulk of this gas has been modeled as an infalling atomic cloud with the northern and eastern arms of the minispiral as the photoionized inner edges of this cloud . if this atomic mass is included in the mass conservation arguments above ,",
    "this reduces the lifetime of the cnd by a factor of 4 , which is still significantly longer than previous estimates .",
    "the sharpness in the dropoff of the distribution of  flux and cnd cores as a function of deprojected distance from  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxversusdistance ] and  [ sec : coreidentify ] ) has implications for the lifetime of the cnd .",
    "more than 70% of the  emission from our observations is contained within the inner 2 pc .",
    "if the cnd has a @xmath21  yr lifetime , as suggested from the mass conservation argument , then there are sufficient molecular gas cores at radii beyond the cnd that over @xmath21  yr could migrate to the cnd , providing a means of maintaining its mass .",
    "@xcite  find evidence for such feeding of the cnd from the 20  molecular cloud at a 10 pc projected distance from and even detect cores within the streamer feeding the cnd .",
    "in contrast , a short lifetime for the cores of the cnd would suggest that the cnd itself is a short - lived structure , as there is insufficient additional material ( as traced either by the cores or by the raw  emission ) outside the cnd but within the inner few parsecs for replenishment .",
    "several stellar populations are observed within the central parsec  @xcite .",
    "these include a 1 - 10 gyr stellar population dominated by emission from red giants  @xcite , tens of blue supergiants tracing a very recent ( 2 - 7 myr ) burst of star formation  @xcite , and a population of presumably young , dust - enshrouded stars  @xcite .",
    "@xcite describe the stellar population of the inner parsec as a metal - rich older star cluster , interspersed with a number of young stars , which dominate the emission in the inner 10 .",
    "@xcite detect a drop in the stellar surface brightness within 0.8  of , likely due to the interaction of the black hole with the surrounding stellar environment .    understanding the formation mechanism of the young stars within the inner parsec has proven extremely difficult",
    ". the enormous gravitational potential of  prevents in situ formation without the aid of shocks or collisions unless molecular clouds have densities greater than 10@xmath115  - 10@xmath116  . while we measure high densities within the cores of the cnd , our measured densities are still 100 - 1000 times below this in situ formation threshold . on the other hand , star formation at greater distances ( ie .",
    "@xmath117 pc ) from  and subsequent inward migration is also unfeasible because the time for two - body relaxation of a star to the inner arcseconds is greater than the observed age of the young stars .",
    "our discovery of the high densities and masses within the cnd cores provides a possible source for the young stars of the central parsec . while the transport of individual stars to the central region is impossible within the observed age of these young stars , star clusters can more quickly migrate to the inner parsec via dynamical friction .",
    "@xcite estimate that a @xmath118  or greater cluster with a diameter of 0.3 pc or less could reach the inner parsec from a radius of 5 pc or less in the 2 - 7 myr age of the young stars .",
    "this formation mechanism had been previously dismissed in part because of the lack of massive cloud cores that could produce such clusters in the inner 5 pc  @xcite .",
    "however , within our sample of 26 massive cnd cores , almost all have diameters less than 0.3 pcs and masses greater than 10@xmath119  .",
    "indeed the most massive core has a mass in excess of 10@xmath120  .",
    "these most massive cores could potentially form a stellar cluster in the cnd with high star formation efficiency and migrate to the galactic center within 2 - 7 myr , producing the observed young stellar population .",
    "for example , evidence suggests that irs13 may be a remnant of one such cluster  @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations of the cnd suggest that the cnd cores we observe are able to collapse and form stars before being shredded in the tidal field of the galactic center ( r. coker 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations have found that a @xmath18  cluster at the radius of the cnd ( or a less massive cluster harboring an intermediate mass black hole ) could spiral into the inner parsec within the lifetime of the 2 - 7 myr stars  @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared imaging of the cnd  @xcite has revealed significant emission at 10 , 20 , and 30 @xmath4 m , especially along the western arc of the minispiral and more diffusely over the entire western side of the cnd .",
    "there are no significant peaks of mid - infrared emission coincident with the cores visible in the cnd .",
    "such a coincidence could have been an indication of active star formation .",
    "sensitive high spatial resolution observations in the mid to far infrared ( ie .",
    "10 - 100@xmath4 m ) would allow for a more precise search for ongoing star - formation within the cnd cores .",
    "cores within the cnd reach densities of a few  @xmath121  , making them tidally stable at distances less than 1 pc from the galactic center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coredensities ] ) .",
    "an alternate explanation , therefore , for the young nuclear star cluster is that a massive core remains tidally stable for the majority of its infall from the cnd onto  and forms stars during this infall .",
    "these new stars would then reach the inner parsec in less than 2 - 7 myr . depending on the efficiency of the star formation in the infalling core , multiple infall events",
    "might be necessary .",
    "these infall events could be spread over a period of a few myr , explaining the observed age spread within the nuclear stellar cluster .",
    "we have presented ovro millimeter observations of  and  emission from the cnd at a spatial resolution of  @xmath122 , a significant improvement in spatial resolution over existing observations . with this enhanced resolution",
    ", we were able to study in great detail the behavior of the cnd in the gravitational potential of the galactic center and the possible role of the cnd in the formation of the young stellar population of the inner parsec .",
    "in particular we find :    \\1 . the cnd ,",
    "as traced by  and  emission is a well - defined structure with an inner radius of @xmath123 ( 1.6 pc ) from and a sharp drop past @xmath124  ( 2.0 pc ) , suggesting a ring - like morphology .",
    "the main  and  emission is consistent with rotation at @xmath2  , although emission at multiple velocities is found in some locations , particularly along the western edge of the cnd .",
    "there is a lack of observed emission in the eastern part of the ring where radial velocities are near 0  because of strong line of sight absorption .",
    "the  flux is typically a factor of 2 - 3 greater than the  flux within the cnd .",
    "however , there is substantial variation in this /  flux ratio with density , likely because of a higher fractional ionization from cosmic rays and thus greater abundance of  in lower density regions .",
    "in addition , shocks may play a role in enhancing the  abundance and flux .",
    "there is good spatial agreement between the h@xmath3 and  emission in the northeastern and southwestern cnd lobes , as well as in the southern and northeastern extensions . in these regions ,",
    "the h@xmath3 is likely uv excited or excited by collisions of the dense cnd cores .",
    "the linear and outer filaments are also seen significantly in h@xmath3 and  ( but not ) and are likely shock - excited .",
    "there are a number of interactions between the ionized gas of the minispiral and the cnd .",
    "in particular , the western arc of the minispiral is both spatially and kinematically consistent with being the ionized inner edge of the cnd .",
    "in addition , , the minispiral northern arm may connect with the northeastern extension of the cnd to form a single collimated structure .",
    "we identify a sample of 26 resolved molecular gas cores within the cnd .",
    "these cores trace the overall  emission and have a characteristic diameter of  @xmath1  6.7  ( 0.25 pc ) .",
    "the cores have a typical density of ( 3 - 4)@xmath8  , and a typical mass of ( 2 - 3)@xmath6  .",
    "the total mass within the cnd is estimated at @xmath125 .",
    "some of the hcn emission may be enhanced by shock chemistry , implying that our estimates of the optically thick and optically thin core masses and densities ( assuming a standard abundance ) are overestimates .",
    "the core density estimates under the assumption of virialization and under the assumption of an optical depth  are similar and often 3 - 5 times the minimum density for tidal stability , suggesting that many of the cores are indeed gravitationally bound .    \\8 .",
    "the enhanced core densities and masses may explain the formation of the massive young ( 2 - 7 myr ) stars found in the inner parsec .",
    "the cores are tidally stable and can undergo star cluster formation while within the cnd .",
    "alternatively , these cores are stable even at closer distances to  and could form stars during an infall process . in either scenario stars can be transported to the inner arcseconds within the observed age of the stars .",

    "<S> the /  emission ratio is typically  @xmath1  0.4 but with significant variations . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in the /  emission and absorption ratios can be attributed to greater abundances of  in lower density regions both within the cnd and along the line - of - sight . </S>",
    "<S> the  emission is well correlated with the h@xmath3 emission at 2.12 @xmath4 m both in the main emission lobes of the cnd and also in four h@xmath3 and  filaments . </S>",
    "<S> multiple areas of interaction between the ionized gas and the cnd are also seen  the western arm of the minispiral is spatially and kinematically consistent with being the ionized inner edge of the cnd , and the northern arm may be connected to the cnd northeast extension .    with the enhanced spatial resolution of the  maps , we resolve numerous dense molecular gas cores within the cnd with characteristic diameter  @xmath5  ( 0.25 pc ) . for 26 of the more isolated cores , we have measured sizes , velocity widths , and integrated fluxes . from these properties we estimated 3 masses for each core : a virial mass assuming the cores </S>",

    "<S> the virial and optically thick masses are in good agreement with a typical mass of ( 2 - 3)@xmath6  and a total cnd gas mass of 10@xmath7  . </S>",
    "<S> the internal densities implied by these core masses ( assuming a uniform density distribution for each core ) are on average ( 3 - 4)@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the core densities are high enough to be stable against tidal disruption from  and the central stellar concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this tidal stability suggests a longer lifetime for the cnd . </S>",
    "<S> the high densities and masses within the cores might support star formation either in the cnd itself or within a core infalling towards the inner parsec , thus providing a mechanism for the formation of the young stellar population observed in the inner arcseconds of the galaxy . </S>"
