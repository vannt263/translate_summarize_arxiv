    "itinerant ferromagnetism was the first collective quantum phenomena considered as a manifestation of the strong coulomb interactions which are present in an electronic system .",
    "however , the origin of this phenomenon is still an open problem .",
    "here we introduce a novel mechanism for itinerant ferromagnetism , which is based on a simple two - band model .",
    "this work is an extension of a previous letter @xcite where we have described the basic ideas . in this paper , we show that the mechanism is supported by the numerical results obtained from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) .",
    "we also analyse the experimental consequences for some @xmath0 electron compounds and the iron group .",
    "however , before describing the details of our mechanism , it is useful to develop a historical perspective for the itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "seventy four years ago , heisenberg @xcite formulated his spin model to address the problem of ferroamgnetism , but as bloch @xcite pointed out , a model of localized spins can not explain the metallic ferromagnetism observed in iron , cobalt and nickel . by introducing the effects of exchange terms into the sommerfeld description of the free - electron gas ,",
    "bloch predicted a ferromagnetic ground state for a sufficiently low electron density . in 1934 , wigner @xcite added the correlation terms to the model considered by bloch . after analyzing the effects of the correlations , he concluded that the conditions for ferromagnetism in the electron gas were so stringent as to be never satisfied .",
    "the first attempt at analyzing a real fm metal , like ni , was made by slater @xcite .",
    "he concluded that the main contribution to the exchange energy is provided by intra - atomic interactions . in the meantime , stoner @xcite introduced his picture where the metallic ferromagnetism results from holes in the @xmath5 band interacting via an exchange energy proportional to the relative magnetization and obeying fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "however , the model considered first by stoner @xcite and later by wohlfarth @xcite , did not take into account the correlations of the @xmath5 electrons , except for the constraints imposed by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "in other words , they did not consider the fact that the coulomb repulsion tends to keep the electrons apart .    in 1953 ,",
    "the importance of these correlations was pointed out by van vleck @xcite .",
    "he emphasized that the energy required to tear off an electron increases rapidly with the degree of ionization .",
    "( the energy of two ni atoms in a @xmath6 configuration is appreciably lower than having one atom in the @xmath7 state and the other one in @xmath8 . )",
    "based on this observation , he proposed an alternative picture ( minimum polarity model ) where the states of higher ionization in ni are ruled out completely , and the configuration @xmath9 is considered to be 40 percent @xmath8 and sixty percent @xmath10 .",
    "the lattice sites occupied by @xmath10 and @xmath8 configurations are continuously redistributing in his picture .",
    "the van vleck proposal is the precursor of the hubbard model for infinite @xmath11 .",
    "following slater @xcite , van vleck @xcite speculated that the contamination by states of higher polarity , not included in his model , provides the exchange interaction ( intra - atomic in this case ) necessary for ferromagnetism .",
    "hence he calculated the effective nearest - neighbor magnetic interaction induced by second order perturbative fluctuations from the @xmath12 configuration to the @xmath13 . in this way ,",
    "van vleck arrived at a model which describes itinerant and correlated ( only allowing @xmath14 and @xmath15 configurations ) holes with a nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath16 ( generalized heisenberg model ) .",
    "however , as van vleck explained at the end of his paper @xcite , the sign and the magnitude of @xmath17 are very sensitive to the precise values of the energies of the different possible intermediate states ( singlets or triplets ) in the @xmath18 configuration .    in 1963 ,",
    "the one - band hubbard model was proposed independently by gutzwiller @xcite , hubbard @xcite and kanamori @xcite to explain the metallic ferromagnetism in the @xmath5 transition metals .",
    "the hubbard model incorporates the kinetic energy in a _ single nondegenerate band _ with an intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath11 to describe the electrons in the @xmath19 band of the transition metals .",
    "in contrast to the previous models , the hubbard model does not include any explicit exchange interaction which favors a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the implicit question raised by this proposal is : can ferromagnetism emerge from the interplay between the kinetic energy and the coulomb repulsion , or it is strictly neccesary to include an explicit exchange interaction provided by the intra - atomic hund s coupling ?",
    "this simple question becomes even more relevant if we consider @xmath0-electron itinerant ferromagnets , like cerh@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite , whose only local magnetic coupling is antiferromagnetic .",
    "unfortunately , with the exception of nagaoka s @xcite and lieb s @xcite theorems , the subsequent theoretical approches were not controlled enough to determine whether the hubbard model has a fm phase .",
    "the central issue is the precise evaluation of the energy for the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase . because it does not properly incorporate the correlations ,",
    "mean field theory overestimates this energy and predicts a large fm region @xcite .",
    "in contrast , numerical calculations have narrowed the extent of this phase to a small region around the nagaoka point @xcite .",
    "there are several controversies in the history of itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "most of them originate in the lack of reliable methodologies to solve strongly correlated hamiltonians . in addition , the number of compounds exhibiting ferromagnetism has increased during the last several decades .",
    "there is a new list of @xmath20 and @xmath11 based compounds which are itinerant ferromagnets @xcite with large curie temperatures ( of the order of 100@xmath21k ) and the only explicit magnetic interaction is antiferromagnetic ( kondo like ) .",
    "this observation stimulated us to reconsider the situation of the iron group and ask whether the ferromagnetism originates in the intra - atomic hund s interaction or is just a consequence of the strong coulomb repulsion between electrons with a particular band structure .",
    "one possible and plausible alternative is that these two phenomena are cooperating to stabilize a ferromagnetic ground state . in any case , it is important to elucidate whether a realistic lattice model only containing repulsive terms ( for instance , the hubbard model ) can sustain a ferromagnetic state , or it is necessary to invoke additional terms which are explicitly ferromagnetic .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is in the first category .",
    "however , the most accurate numerical calculations seem to indicate that this model does not sustain a ferromagnetic ground state .    going beyond",
    "the simple one - band hubbard model has been advocated , for instance , by vollhardt _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they note that the inclusion of additional coulomb density - density interactions , correlated hoppings , and direct exchange interactions favors fm ordering in the single - band hubbard model .",
    "in fact , a very simple analysis shows that increasing the density of states @xmath22 below the fermi energy @xmath23 and placing @xmath23 close to the lower band edge increases the fm tendency",
    ". one can achieve this by including a next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath24 or by placing the hoppings on frustrated ( non - bipartite ) lattices .",
    "the effectiveness of @xmath24 was studied numerically by hlubina et .",
    "@xcite for the hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "they found a fm state when the van hove singularity in @xmath22 occurred at @xmath23 .",
    "however , this phase was not robust against very small changes in @xmath24 .",
    "after seven decades of intense effort , the microscopic mechanisms driving the metallic fm phase are still unknown @xcite .",
    "we still do not know what is the minimal lattice model of itinerant ferromagnetism and , more importantly , the basic mechanism of ordering . while the hubbard model is so reluctant to have a fm state",
    ", there is an increasing amount of evidence indicating that the periodic anderson model ( pam ) has a fm phase in a large region of its quantum phase diagram @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath25 orbitals of the transition metals are hybridized with the @xmath26 bands , we can consider the inclusion of a second band as the next step in the search of itinerant ferromagnetism from pure coulomb repulsions . indeed a very simple extension of the pam can be used to describe the physics of the iron group @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is large number of cerium and uranium compounds , like ce(rh@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3b@xmath4 ( @xmath27 ) @xcite , cerh@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite , and us , use , and ute @xcite which are metallic ferromagnets and can be describred with the pam .",
    "ferromagnetism is readily found in the pam by mean - field approximations in any dimensions @xcite . using a slave - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) for the symmetric pam , mller and",
    "wlfe @xcite found a pm or antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase at half filling depending on the value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 . by lowering the density of electrons from 1/2 filling",
    ", they also found a smooth crossover from af to fm order via a spiral phase .",
    "just before 1/4 filling , they got a first - order transition from fm to af order .",
    "more recently , the sbmft calculations of doradzi ' nski and spalek @xcite found wide regions of ferromagnetism in the intermediate valence regime that surprisingly extended well below 1/4 filling .",
    "a ferromagnetic phase is also obtained when the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) is applied to the pam @xcite .",
    "tahvildar - zadeh _ et al .",
    "_ found a region of ferromagnetism and studied its temperature dependence . at very low temperatures ,",
    "their ferromagnetic region extended over a wide range of electron fillings and in many cases embraced the electron filling of 3/8 .",
    "they proposed a specific kondo - induced mechanism for ferromagnetism at 3/8 filling that has the conduction electrons in a spin - polarized charge density - wave anti - aligned with the ferromagnetically aligned local moments on the valence orbitals .",
    "more recently meyer and nolting@xcite appended perturbation theory to dmft and also predicted ferromagnetism over a broad range of electron filling extending below 1/4 filling .",
    "in addition schwieger and nolting @xcite also considered an extension of the pam , similar to the one considerd here , to estimate the importance of @xmath28 hybridization for the magnetic properties of transition metals .",
    "there is also a considerable amount of numerical evidence showing ferromagnetic solutions for the ground state of the pam .",
    "noack and guerrero @xcite , for example , found partially and completely saturated ferromagnetism using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method in one dimension .",
    "they considered a parameter regime where there is one electron in each @xmath0 orbital . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath11 ,",
    "the model exhibited a ferromagnetic ground state . beyond an interaction - dependent value of the doping and a doping - dependent value of @xmath11 , this state disappeared .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase was a peninsula in a phase diagram that was otherwise a sea of paramagnetism except at 1/4 and 1/2 filling where the ground state of the pam was antiferromagnetic .",
    "our previous @xcite and new qmc results qualitatively agree with the dmrg work ; however , the phases we find quantitatively and qualitatively disagree with those derived from the mean - field approximations .",
    "quantitatively , we find ferromagnetism in a narrower doping range than the one predicted by the dmft and sbmft calculations . for fillings between 3/8 and 1/2 , qmc predicts a pm region , whereas mean - field theory predicts ferromagnetic states in part of that region . in fact , at a filling of 3/8 where dmft calculations predict ferromagnetism , we find a novel ground state of an entirely different symmetry . instead of ferromagnetism",
    ", qmc finds a resonating spin density - wave ( rsdw ) state ; that is , the ground state was a linear combination of two degenerate spin - density waves characterized by the @xmath29 and @xmath30 wave vectors .",
    "the novel mechanism we introduce in the present paper operates when the system is in a mixed valence regime .",
    "this regime has been studied numerically only in the context of dmft @xcite .",
    "we will show however that the ferromagnetic solution obtained with dmft in the mixed valence regime has a different origin and therefore is not representative of our new mechanism .",
    "the main ingredients for our mechanism are an uncorrelated dispersive band which is hybridized with a correlated and narrow band .",
    "we show the pam supports our mechanism by doing quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations on one and two dimensional lattices .",
    "the results of these simulations are interpreted with an effective hamiltonian derived from the pam . in this way",
    ", we establish that the new mechanism can be interpreted as a generalization to the lattice of the first hund s rule for the atom . the two level band structure generated by",
    "the gap recreates for the lattice , the shell - like level strucure of the hydrogenic atom .",
    "when the lower shell is incomplete , the local part of the coulomb interaction is minimized by polarizing the electrons which are occupying the incomplete shell .",
    "the pam was originally introduced to explain the properties of the the rare - earth and actinide metallic compounds including the so called heavy fermion compounds .",
    "a very simple extension of this model can also be applied to the description of many transition metals @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of this model are a narrow and correlated @xmath0 band hybridized with a despersive and uncorrelated @xmath25 band .",
    "the hamiltonian associated with this model is :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 create an electron with spin @xmath36 in @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals at lattice site @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 hoppings are only to nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "when @xmath43 , the hamiltonian is the standard pam . for the @xmath0 electron compounds , the @xmath38 and @xmath37 orbitals play the role of the @xmath0 and @xmath25 orbitals , and @xmath44",
    ". for transition metals ,",
    "they correspond to the @xmath5 and @xmath45 orbitals . unless otherwise specified , we will set @xmath46 .    for @xmath47 , the resulting hamiltonian @xmath48",
    "is easily diagonalized : @xmath49 where the dispersion relations for the upper and the lower bands are : @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 for a hypercubic lattice in dimension @xmath52 .",
    "the operators which create quasi - particles in the lower and upper bands are :    @xmath53    with @xmath54 the noninteracting bands @xmath55 are plotted in fig .  1 for a one dimensional system .",
    "if @xmath56 , we can identify regions with well defined @xmath0 or @xmath25 character in the lower and the upper bands .",
    "in particular , the case illustrated in fig .  1 corresponds to a situation where the @xmath38 and the @xmath37 bands were crossing before being hybridized ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we see a small region in the center of the lower band which is dispersive and large regions on both sides which are nearly flat .",
    "the upper band exhibits the opposite behavior .",
    "the nearly flat regions in each band correspond to states with a predominant @xmath0 character , while the dispersive regions are associated to the states with @xmath25 character .",
    "the pam has different regimes depending on the values of its parameters and the particle concentration @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the total number of particles and @xmath60 is the number of unit cells ) .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath62 , there is one particle ( magnetic moment ) localized in each @xmath38 orbital , and the fluctuations to the conduction band can be considered in a perturbative way . by this procedure",
    ", the pam can be reduced to the kondo lattice model ( klm ) @xcite which contains only one parameter @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "the klm has been extensively studied @xcite , and the evolution of its phase diagram is described for instance in a review article by tsunetsugu _ et al _ @xcite",
    ". one of the earliest approaches to the klm is the mean field treatment of doniach @xcite for the related one dimensional kondo necklace . for half filling",
    ", this approximation leads to a transition from a nel ordered state in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath66 ) to a nonmagnetic ` kondo singlet ' state above the critical value @xmath67 .",
    "lacroix and cyrot @xcite did a more extensive mean field treatment for three dimensional klm .",
    "they also found a magnetically ordered state for weak coupling . for low density of conduction electrons .",
    "in their phase diagram , the ordered state is ferromagnetic for low and intermediate densities of conduction electrons , and antiferromagnetic in the vicinity of half filling .",
    "the ` kondo singlet ' phase appears above some critical value of @xmath68 in the whole range of concentrations .    using another mean field treatment for the one dimensional klm , fazekas and mller - hartmann @xcite obtained a phase diagram containing",
    "only magnetically ordered phases : spiral below some critical value of @xmath63 which depends on the particle density and ferromagnetic above this value . to get this result",
    ", they fixed the orientation of the localized spins in a spiral ordering and minimized the total energy with respect to the wave vector of the spiral . even though this treatment of the spin polarized state is valid for classical spins , it neglects completely the kondo singlet formation which occurs in the strong coupling limit for the considered case ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "sigrist _ et al _ @xcite gave an exact treatment of one dimensional klm for the strong coupling regime @xmath70 finding a ferromagnetic phase for any particle density .",
    "however , it is important to remark that the mechanism driving the ferromagnetism in the later case is not the same as the double - exchange mechanism associated with the mean field solution of fazekas and mller - hartmann @xcite . to understand this difference",
    ", we just need to notice that for @xmath71 mean field @xcite predicts a ferromagnetic solution while the exact solution has a complete spin degeneracy .",
    "therefore double - exchange is not the mechanism driving the ferromagnetic phase of the klm ( at least when the localized spins are @xmath69 ) .",
    "the real mechanism has been unveiled by sigrist _",
    "et al _ @xcite who used degenerate perturbation theory to determine the lifting of this degeneracy when the ratio @xmath63 becomes finite .",
    "the new ground state is an itinerant ferromagnet for any concentration of conduction electrons . in this state ,",
    "the spins which are not participating in kondo singlet are fully polarized .",
    "we can see from their solution that the motion of the kondo singlets stabilizes the fm state in a way similar to nagaoka s solution @xcite .",
    "the second order effective hamiltonian obtained after the perturbative calculation includes nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath72 , plus a next - nearest - neighbor correlated hopping @xmath73 which is order @xmath74 .",
    "then there are two different ways to move a kondo singlet from one site to its next - nearest - neighbor : by two applications of @xmath72 or by one application of @xmath73 .",
    "only when the background is ferromagnetic do both processes lead to the same final state .",
    "if @xmath73 has the appropriate sign ( which is the case for the klm @xcite ) the resulting interference is `` constructive '' and the fm state has the lowest energy .",
    "we can see in this example that the motion of the kondo singlet can stabilize a magnetic phase .",
    "there are different regimes for which the pam can not be reduced to a klm by a perturbative approach .",
    "one of these situations corresponds to the intermediate valence region : @xmath75 . in this case",
    "@xmath76 is not longer close to one and the @xmath38 electrons can move .    in fig .  1",
    ", we illustrate the ( one - dimensional ) non - interacting bands for the case of interest : @xmath77 close to @xmath23 and above the bottom of the @xmath37 band .",
    "if @xmath56 , we can identify two subspaces in each band where the states have either @xmath37 ( @xmath78 subspace ) or @xmath38 ( @xmath79 subspace ) character .",
    "the size of the crossover region around the points where the original unhybridized @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands crossed is proportional to @xmath80 ; that is , it is very small .",

    "2 we can see that @xmath105 is much larger than any other weight .",
    "this is so because the @xmath79 orbitals have predominantly @xmath38 character , while the @xmath78 orbitals have mostly @xmath37 character in the considered region of parameters .",
    "therefore we can approximate the creation operator @xmath106 by : @xmath107 as a consequence of this approximation , the @xmath38 subspace becomes invariant under the application of @xmath96 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , we can establish a hierarchy of terms where the lowest order one corresponds to a simple on - site repulsion : @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the next order terms , containing three and two @xmath112 factors , are much smaller and are essentially the same as the intersite interactions which in the past were added to the hubbard model to enhance the ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "adding @xmath113 to @xmath88 we get the effective hamiltonian : @xmath114 the @xmath78 and @xmath79 orbitals form uncorrelated and correlated non - hybridized bands : @xmath115 . for the @xmath79 orbitals we obtain an effective one band hubbard model with the peculiar double shell like dispersion relation shown by the thick lines in fig .  1 .    particularly for @xmath116 , @xmath117 has a very large density of states in the lower shell of the @xmath79 band @xcite which is located near @xmath77 . from fig .  1 it is also clear that the electrons first doubly occupy the uncorrelated @xmath78 band states which are below @xmath77",
    "however , when @xmath23 gets close to @xmath77 , i.e. , the system is in the mixed valence regime , the electrons close to the fermi level go into some of the correlated @xmath79 states",
    ". then , the interaction term @xmath113 , combined with the double shell band structure of @xmath118 , gives rise to a fm ground state ( gs ) : the electrons close to @xmath23 spread to higher unoccupied @xmath119 states and polarize , which causes the spatial part of their wave function to become antisymmetric , eliminating double occupancy in real space and reducing the coulomb repulsion to zero .",
    "the cost of polarizing is just an increase in the kinetic energy proportional to @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the fermi velocity and @xmath122 is the interval in @xmath119 space in which the electrons are polarized .    to determine the stability of this unsaturated fm state , we compare its energy with that of the pm state .",
    "if we were to build a nonmagnetic state with only the states of the lower @xmath79 shell , we would find a restricted delocalization for each electron because of the exclusion of the finite set of band states ( @xmath119-states ) in the upper shell . to avoid the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 for double occupying a given site ,",
    "the electrons need to occupy all @xmath119-states .",
    "this means they have to occupy the @xmath79 states in the upper and lower shells .",
    "this restricted delocalization is a direct consequence of heisenberg s uncertainty principle , and the resulting localization length depends on the wave vectors , where the original @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands crossed , that define the size ( @xmath123 ) of each shell .",
    "the energy cost for occupying the @xmath79 states in the upper shell is proportional to the hybridization gap @xmath124 .",
    "therefore if @xmath11 is the dominant energy scale in the problem and @xmath125 , the fm state lies lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state . under these conditions ,",
    "the effective fm interaction is proportional to the hybridization gap @xmath124 .",
    "this mechanism for ferromagnetism on a lattice is analogous to the intra - atomic hund s mechanism polarizing electrons in atoms . in atoms",
    ", we also have different degenerate ( the equivalent of @xmath126 is zero ) shells separated by an energy gap .",
    "if the valence shell is open , the electrons polarize to avoid the short range part of the coulomb repulsion ( again reflecting the pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "the energy of an eventual nonmagnetic state is proportional either to the magnitude of the coulomb repulsion or to the energy gap between different shells .",
    "the interplay between both energies sets the scale of hund s intra - atomic exchange coupling .",
    "our numerical method , the constrained - path monte carlo ( cpmc ) method , is extensively described and benchmarked elsewhere.@xcite here we only discuss its basic features , assumptions and special details about our use of it .    in the cpmc method , the ground - state wave function @xmath127 is projected from a known initial wave function @xmath128 by a branching random walk in an over - complete space of slater determinants @xmath129 .",
    "in such a space , we can write @xmath130 , where @xmath131 . the random walk produces an ensemble of @xmath129 , called random walkers , which represent @xmath127 in the sense that their distribution is a monte carlo sampling of @xmath132 , that is , a sampling of the ground - state wave function .    to completely specify @xmath127 ,",
    "only determinants satisfying @xmath133 are needed because @xmath127 resides in either of two degenerate halves of the slater determinant space , separated by a nodal plane . in the cpmc method",
    "the fermion sign problem occurs because walkers can cross this plane as their orbitals evolve continuously in the random walk . without _ a priori _ knowledge of this plane , we use a trial wave function @xmath128 and require @xmath134 .",
    "the random walk solves schrdinger s equation in determinant space , but under an approximate boundary - condition .",
    "this is what is called the constrained - path approximation .",
    "the quality of the calculation depends on the quality of the trial wave function @xmath128 .",
    "fortunately , extensive testing has demonstrated a significant insensitivity of the results to reasonable choices : since the constraint only involves the overall sign of its overlap with any determinant @xmath129 , some insensitivity of the results to @xmath128 is expected @xcite .",
    "besides as starting point and as a condition constraining a random walker , we also use @xmath128 as an importance function . specifically , we use @xmath135 to bias the random walk into those parts of slater determinant space that have a large overlap with the trial state . for all three uses of @xmath128 ,",
    "it clearly is advantageous to have @xmath128 approximate @xmath127 as closely as possible . only in the constraining of the path",
    "does @xmath136 in general generate an approximation .",
    "we constructed @xmath137 from the eigenstates of the non - interacting problem .",
    "because the total and z - component spin angular momentum , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , are good quantum numbers , we could choose unequal numbers of up and down electrons to produce trial states and hence ground states with @xmath140 .",
    "whenever possible , we would simulate closed shells of up and down electrons , as such cases usually provided energy estimates with the least statistical error , but because we wanted to study the ground state energy as a function of @xmath138 , we frequently had to settle for just the up or down shell being closed . in some cases , the desired value of @xmath138 could not be generated from either shell being closed .",
    "also we would select the non - interacting states so @xmath141 would be translationally invariant , even if these states used did not all come from the fermi sea .",
    "the use of unrestricted hartree - fock eigenstates to generate@xmath142 instead of the non - interacting eigenstates generally produced no significant improvement in the results .",
    "in particular , we represented the trial wavefunction as a single slater determinant whose columns are the @xmath143 single - particle orbitals obtained from the exact solution of @xmath48 .",
    "we chose the orbitals with lowest energies given by @xmath144 and filled them up to a desired number of electrons @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath145 where @xmath146 represents a vacuum for electrons . since our calculations were performed for a less than full lower band , only states from the lower band were used to construct the trial wavefunction .    in a typical run",
    "we set the average number of random walkers to 400 .",
    "we performed 2000 monte carlo sweeps before we taking measurements , and we made the measurements in 40 blocks of 400 steps . by choosing @xmath147 , we reduced the systematic error associated with the trotter approximation to be smaller than the statistical error . in measuring correlation functions , we performed between 20 to 40 back - propagation steps .",
    "in section iii , we have described a new mechanism for itinerant ferromagnetism which is present in the mixed valence regime for @xmath148 . in addition",
    ", we mentioned that the system is also expected to be fm when the @xmath0 magnetic moments are localized ( @xmath149 ) because the effective rkky coupling is negative when the fermi surface is small ( @xmath150 ) . in this section",
    "we show that the itinerant and the localized ferromagnetic states are continuously connected in the phase diagram of the pam",
    ". however , the energy scale of the first state is much larger than the rkky interaction which characterizes the second one .",
    "the existence of a crossover region between both states could explain the fact that there are some @xmath0-electron compounds for which it is very difficult to determine whether they are itinerant or localized ferromagnets .",
    "in addition , we will see that the qmc results are consistent with the simple picture derived from our effective model ( eq .  [ [ heff ] ] ) . according to that picture",
    ", the ferromagnetic state in the mixed valence regime should be similar to a partially polarized non - interacting solution where the polarized electrons are the ones occupying the @xmath0-character orbitals .",
    "it is only in the crossover region of size @xmath151 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , where the orbitals have a mixed character , that the correlations introduce an appreciable effect .",
    "this effect is the well known kondo - like singlet correlation between the @xmath25 and the @xmath0 electrons .",
    "however , it is important to remark that these kondo singlets only exist in an energy interval @xmath152 ( where @xmath153 is the @xmath25 bandwidth ) , and therefore the number of kondo singlets @xmath154 is much smaller than the number of magnetic moments @xmath155 : @xmath156 .",
    "this is a simple manifestation of the `` exhaustion '' phenomenon described by noziers @xcite . since most of the @xmath0 magnetic moments are ferromagnetically polarized , the role of these few kondo singlets is marginal in our fm solution .",
    "therefore , for the mixed valence regime with @xmath157 , the @xmath0 magnetic moments which are not screened by @xmath25 electrons develop an effective magnetic interaction as a consequence of the interplay between the local coulomb interaction and the particular band structure . in other words , the `` collective kondo state '' which was proposed in the past @xcite",
    "is replaced by band ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nature of local moment compensation in the pam differs qualitatively from that in the single impurity anderson model @xcite . in the pam ,",
    "if the ground state is a singlet , then @xmath158 in the impurity model , the last term is absent , and the resulting expression is the analytic statement of the well - known clogston - anderson compensation theorem that express the compensation of the f - moment by the conduction electrons . in the pam ,",
    "on the other hand , the last term dominates the first so the f - moment is compensated largely by correlations induced among themselves .    to understand the nature of the fm solution",
    ", we plotted the mean occupation number of the quasiparticle operators which diagonalize the non - interacting problem ( see eq .",
    "[ quasi ] ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fnk1 ] for the lowest energy pm ( @xmath159 ) state in a two dimensional cluster of @xmath160 unit cells .",
    "there we can see that the @xmath25-character states of the lower band are close to be doubly occupied .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0-character region has a smaller occupation number ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the populations of the @xmath0-character states in the lower and the upper bands are very similar .",
    "this delocalization in the momentum space is a direct consequence of the tendency to avoid double - occupancy in the real space .",
    "this tendency indicates that the energy increase of the pm state due to the inclusion of @xmath11 is proportional to the hybridization gap .",
    "[ fnk2 ] shows the quasiparticle occupation numbers for the partially saturated fm ground state . while the @xmath37-character states of the lower band are still close to being doubly occupied , the @xmath38-character ones are polarized and the occupation number is one for any of them .",
    "in contrast to the pm solution ( see fig.[fnk1 ] ) , the occupation number for the @xmath0-character states in the upper band is much smaller .",
    "this difference can be understood in the following way : the polarized @xmath0-electrons can localize in momentum space because the pauli exclusion principle prevents double occupancy in real space ( the spatial wave function is completely antisymmetric ) . therefore the @xmath38-electrons do not need to occupy the upper band states and the energy increase due to the repulsive @xmath11 term is proportional to @xmath162 .",
    "the non - zero amount of electrons occupying the center of the upper band ( see fig .  [ fnk2 ] ) is related to the crossover region for which the @xmath38 and the @xmath37 character of the states are comparable . since the electrons occupying these states are not polarized , the effect of the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 is the transfer of spectral weight from the lower to the upper band to avoid double occupancy in real space .",
    "we can see from figs .",
    "[ fn1d ] and [ fn1d2 ] that a similar behavior is obtained for one dimensional systems . as we explained in section iii ,",
    "the mechanism for this ferromagnetism works in any finite dimension .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "[ fn1d ] that there is a jump in the occupation number of the lower band as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "the inverse of this jump is proportional to effective mass of the quasiparticles of the pramagnetic solution .",
    "when @xmath77 decreases , the system evolves into a state where the @xmath38 electrons are localized .",
    "this evolution is reflected in the decrease of the jump and the consequent increase of the effective mass .    for @xmath47",
    "the system is a pm metal .",
    "therefore there must be a critical value of the on site repulsion @xmath163 which separates the pm from the fm region .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath163 is : @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath167 ( see fig .",
    "[ evsu ] ) .",
    "this is also in agreement with the mechanism described in section iii .",
    "if @xmath168 and @xmath11 becomes larger than the hybridization gap @xmath124 , the system evolves into a fm state to avoid the double occupancy without an increase in the kinetic energy proportional to the hybridization gap .    according to figs .",
    "[ evsu]b and [ evss ] the magnetization seems to increase gradually when @xmath11 is increased beyond its critical value .",
    "this behavior suggests that the fm transition as function of @xmath11 is of second order .",
    "if this is so , the properties of the pm fermi liquid which is obtained for @xmath169 should be strongly affected by the fm fluctuations when @xmath11 approaches @xmath163 .",
    "it is known that the effective mass of the quasi - particles diverges in the approach to a zero temperature ferromagnetic instability @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the behavior of the pm fermi liquid can not be understood by analogy with the one impurity problem .",
    "the kondo temperature , which is the characteristic energy scale of the one impurity problem , is replaced by a new fermi temperature which is dominated by the ferromagnetic fluctuations and goes to zero when @xmath11 approaches to @xmath163 from below .",
    "another relevant parameter for the fm solution is the hybridization @xmath170 . for @xmath171 and @xmath172",
    "there is a complete spin degeneracy for the electrons occupying the localized @xmath38 orbitals . by increasing @xmath170",
    ", we are simultaneously changing the fermi velocity @xmath121 and the hybridization gap @xmath124 .",
    "for small values of @xmath170 , @xmath124 is much larger than @xmath173 in the region under consideration . for this reason",
    ", a non - zero value of @xmath170 removes the original spin degeneracy stabilizing the partially polarized fm solution ( see fig .  [ evsv ] ) .",
    "when @xmath170 is larger than @xmath174 , the two relevant energy scales , @xmath124 and @xmath175 , become of the same order and the partially polarized fm is replaced by a pm phase . in the unrealistic large @xmath170 limit ( @xmath176 ) ,",
    "the ground state consists of local kondo singlets moving in a background of localized spins @xcite .    finally , the most sensitive parameter for the stabilization of the fm state is the difference @xmath177 . in fig .",
    "[ evsef ] , we show the energy difference @xmath178 between the fm ground state and the lowest energy pm ( @xmath159 ) state as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath77 is considerably smaller than @xmath23 , the @xmath38 electrons are localized and the magnetism is dominated by the rkky interaction .",
    "the order of this interaction is @xmath179 .",
    "this gives the small value of @xmath178 when the @xmath38 levels are below the bottom of the conduction band @xmath180 .",
    "the most stable region for the fm state ( maximum value of @xmath178 ) starts when @xmath77 reaches the fermi level . for the case of fig .",
    "[ evsef ] , this occurs at @xmath181 .",
    "again this result is in agreement with the mechanism described in section iii . if we continue increasing the value of @xmath77 , the number of @xmath38 electrons decreases and the magnetization is consequently reduced ( see fig .",
    "[ evsef]b ) . finally , when @xmath77 is no longer close to the bottom of the conduction band , @xmath126 becomes comparable to @xmath124 and the ferromagnetism disappears .",
    "[ evsef2 ] shows the @xmath77 dependence of @xmath178 for two and three dimensional clusters . as in the one dimensional case ,",
    "the stablity of the fm phase increases when the system appraches the mixed valence regime .",
    "if @xmath77 is further increased , the magnetization goes to zero in a smooth way indicating that the associated quantum phase transition is of second order .    in figs .",
    "[ scaled1 ] and [ scaled2 ] we show the scaling of @xmath182 and the magnetization per site in one and two dimensional systems .",
    "the @xmath183 extrapolation for the one dimensional systems indicates that the fm ground state is stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the extrapolated value for the magnetization is @xmath184 , i.e. , only a fraction of the @xmath0 electrons is polarized .",
    "the size effects are stronger in two dimensional systems . in fig .",
    "[ scaled2 ] , we show two different cases : the circles correspond to a sequence of tilted suqare clusters which allows us to fix the concentration in @xmath185 ; the squares correspond to a sequence of untilted square clusters for which the value of the concentration is the closest to @xmath186 . despite the considerable size effects , these results indicate that the fm state is stable in the thermodynamic limit . in this case",
    ", the extrapolated magnetization is close to 0.4 .",
    "meyer and nolting @xcite have also found a fm solution for the pam in a similar region of parameters using dmft .",
    "however it is important to remark that the mechanism for ferromagnetism described in section iii only works in finite dimension because the volume of the upper shell relative to the volume of the lower one goes to zero when the dimension goes to infinity .",
    "therefore , the reason why a fm state is obtained with dmft should be different .",
    "this is also reflected by the fact that the energy scale ( @xmath187 ) of the fm solution found with dmft for the localized regime is larger than the one for the mixed valence regime ( region iv of ref .",
    "this behavior is opposite to our result ( see fig .",
    "[ evsef ] ) .",
    "during the last few years new experimental results have confirmed that there are ce based compounds which can not be treated as typical kondo systems . for instance",
    ", cerh@xmath3b@xmath4 has a very high fm ordering temperature ( @xmath188 ) which sicks out from a localized @xmath189-electron description @xcite .",
    "in addition the alloy series ce(rh@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite and la@xmath2ce@xmath1rh@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite exhibit many unusual characteristics which require a new macroscopic description with respect to the competition among classical kondo versus rkky interactions @xcite .",
    "absorption edge spectroscopy measurements of ce(rh@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3b@xmath4 for different values of @xmath190 indicate that the stoichiometric compound cerh@xmath3b@xmath4 is in the mixed valence regime ( fluctuating between the @xmath191 and the @xmath192 configurations ) @xcite . after doping with ru",
    ", there is strong transfer of weight from the @xmath191 line to the @xmath192 structure .",
    "this change can be understood in the context of the pam if we take into account that the volume of the system decreases when ce is replaced by rh @xcite . in this situation",
    "the width of the conduction band increases and some @xmath0 electrons are transferred to @xmath25 character orbitals ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . according to our results",
    "this change must decrease the value of the zero temperature magnetization and the curie temperature @xmath187 . by increasing the doping level we can reach a situation where most of the @xmath0 electrons that were polarized in the stoichiometric compound",
    "are transferred to the @xmath25 character orbitals and the zero temperature magnetization is very small . in this",
    "limit the system should have some pm states very close to the fermi level ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "when the energy difference between the fermi level and these pm states becomes smaller than @xmath187 , the magnetization can increase with temperature because the electrons which are occupying the pm states near the fermi level are thermally promoted to the @xmath0 character states which are above the fermi level . in this process ,",
    "the electrons are polarized because of the mechanism discussed above .",
    "this explains the finite temperature peak in the magnetization of ce(rh@xmath1ru@xmath193)@xmath3b@xmath4 ( for @xmath190 between 0.06 and 0.125 ) @xcite that suggests an ordered state with high entropy .",
    "the source of the large entropy is thus associated with charge and not with spin degrees of freedom which is why a state with larger @xmath194 has a higher entropy . from this analysis",
    "we predict that the integral of the entropy below @xmath187 , which can be extracted from the specific heat measurements , contains a considerable contribution from the _ the charge _",
    "degrees of freedom .    when ce is replaced by la , the volume of the system increases @xcite and the magnetic moments become more localized .",
    "in this case , the weight in the absorption edge spectroscopy is transferred from the @xmath195 structure to the @xmath196 line . again",
    "this can be understood if we take into account that the width of the conduction band decreases in this case and the electrons are transferred from the @xmath25 to the @xmath0 character orbitals ( see [ fig1 ] ) . in this way",
    "the system evolves from the itinerant to the localized situation ( @xmath197 ) . according to our results ( see fig.[evsef ] ) , this change should increase the value of the zero temperature magnetization and simultaneously decrease the curie temperature @xmath187 ( @xmath178 is strongly reduced because the effective magnetic interaction in the localized limit , @xmath198 , is order @xmath199 @xcite ) .",
    "this anomalous behavior has been experimentally observed by shaheen et al @xcite in la@xmath2ce@xmath1rh@xmath3b@xmath4 .",
    "we can also connect our mechanism with the hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath187 . to do this we calculated @xmath200 by the qmc method as function of increasing @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ press]a ) .",
    "here we are assuming that the main effect of the hydrostatic pressure is to increase @xmath41 and to leave the other parameters unchanged . the order of magnitude of @xmath200 , which should be proportional to @xmath187 , and its qualitative behavior in fig .",
    "3a are in good agreement with the experimental results for cerh@xmath3b@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "3a that for the itinerant fm case , @xmath178/n is of the order of 100@xmath21k .",
    "this scale is much larger than the magnitude of the rkky interaction @xcite ( @xmath201k ) which is commonly used to explain the origin of the magnetic phase when the @xmath38 electrons are localized .",
    "we also find that the fm state appears close to quarter filling and disappears for @xmath202 close to @xmath203 .",
    "the fm uranium monochalcogenides us , use and ute are semi - metals with large curie temperatures of @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 and ordered moments of 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.2@xmath207 respectively @xcite .",
    "most of the magnetic properties of these systems are still unexplained .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to argue that the new mechanism for ferromagnetism introduced above is a good candidate to explain some of the mysteries related to these compounds .",
    "erds and robinson @xcite suggested that the uranium monochalcogenides are mixed valence systems .",
    "this suggestion was reinforced by measuring the poisson ratio as a function of the chalcogen mass with low temperature ultrasonic studies on use and ute @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of an intermediate valence regime and ferromagnetism is one of the unexplained properties of these compounds as it is recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to the traditional picture @xcite",
    ", the system should behave as a nonmagnetic collective kondo state in the intermediate valence regime .",
    "in contrast to this picture , our results show that a partially saturated ferromagnetic state is stabilized in the mixed valence regime .",
    "this can explain the first striking property of the uranium monochalcogenides .",
    "the other unusual property of these compounds is the shape of the magnetization curve versus temperature which has a maximum below @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "again this is a property which can be easily explained ( see the subsection about the ce compounds ) within the context of the pam .",
    "in addition , the order of magnitude of the curie temperature of these compounds coincides with the energy scale obtained from the pam for the intermediate valence regime .",
    "the uranium monochalcogenides , like the ce based compounds above described , exhibit a non - monotonic behavior for the @xmath187 as a function of pressure @xcite .",
    "[ press ] shows that this behavior can also be explained with the pam .",
    "notice however that the non - monotonic behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ press ] has nothing to do with a competition between kondo and rkky interactions .",
    "finally , the spin wave dispersions of these compounds also present some anomalies .",
    "for instance , neutron scattering experiments on a single - domain ute crystal ( @xcite ) show that for wave vectors @xmath208 perpendicular to the ordered moment the excitations become more damped with increasing @xmath208 . in us",
    "only a broad continuum of magnetic response is observed @xcite . damped and unpolarized",
    "spin waves are observed in use @xcite .",
    "these properties indicate that the itinerant character of the @xmath0 electrons is essential to have a good description of the magnetic excitations .",
    "even though the transition metals are the most well studied itinerant ferromagnets , the ultimate reason for the stabilization of the fm phase is still unknown . since the minimal correlated model ( hubbard hamiltonian ) proposed to describe these systems does not seem to have a fm solution , it is reasonable to ask whether an extension of this minimal model , including more than one band , is necessary and enough to stabilize the fm solution .",
    "the correlated @xmath5 band of the transition metals is hybridized with weakly correlated and dispersive @xmath19 and @xmath209 bands .",
    "this situation is similar to the case already described for the @xmath0 electron compounds .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask if there is a connection between the itinerant ferromagnetism of the @xmath0 and the @xmath25 electron compounds .",
    "notice that the order of magnitude of the @xmath187 is the same .",
    "following the same motivation and using dmft , schwieger and nolting @xcite concluded that the @xmath25-band ferromagnetism can be stabilized when the hybridization between both bands is small .",
    "however , these authors also find a fm solution for the one band problem .    in the case of the transition metals , the dispersion of the narrower band ( @xmath5 ) can not be neglected .",
    "for this reason , we studied the stability of the fm solution as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ press2 ] that the fm phase is even more stable for @xmath210 than for @xmath43 and becomes unstable for @xmath211 .",
    "the reason for this asymmetric behavior is easy to understand in terms of the variation of @xmath126 : if @xmath42 is negative , then the effect of @xmath42 on the dispersion of the @xmath79 band is opposite to that of the hybridization @xmath170 ( see fig .  [ ekta ] ) . when @xmath212 , we get , for the given @xmath77 and @xmath170 , the minimum value for @xmath213 and therefore the most stable fm case .",
    "when we depart from this value of @xmath42 , @xmath213 increases , @xmath178 decreases , and the fm state becomes less stable .",
    "this result indicates that the hybridization between bands can play a crucial role for the ferromagnetism of the iron group . in other words , the ferromagnetism of the transition metals can originate , at least in part , in the interplay between the correlations and the particular band structure and not solely in the intra - atomic hund s exchange @xcite .",
    "we introduced a novel mechanism for itinerant ferromagnetism which is present in a simple two band model consisting of a narrow correlated band hybridized with a dispersive and uncorrelated one .",
    "the picture just presented , combined with our previous results @xcite , allows a reconciliation of the localized and delocalized ferromagnetism pictures painted by heisenberg @xcite and bloch @xcite .",
    "the hybridization between bands and the particular band structure play a crucial role in this mechanism because they generate a multi - shell structure for the correlated orbitals .",
    "this structure , when combined with the a local coulomb repulsion , favors a ferromagnetic state .",
    "the mechanism is analogous to the one which generates the atomic hund interaction . in this sense , this is a generalization to the solid of the atomic hund s rule .",
    "the mechanism works in any finite dimension .    the determination of a minimal model to explain the metallic ferromagnetism of highly correlated systems has been the object of intense effort during the last forty years .",
    "the results presented in this paper suggest that the pam is a minimal hamiltonian which can explain the itinerant ferromagnetism without including any explicit fm interaction .",
    "another important aspect of this ferromagnetic solution is its mixed valence character . according to the traditional picture @xcite",
    ", the mixed valence regime should be a pm kondo state .",
    "the appearance of a ferromagnetic instability in this region of doping rises some questions about the entire validity of a kondo - like description inspired by the one impurity problem .",
    "even the pm phase obtained for @xmath169 is strongly influenced by the proximity to a fm instability @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the relevance of these results for some @xmath0-electron compounds which are itinerant ferromagnets with high curie temperatures ( @xmath214 ) . in particular , the are several unusual characteristics of the ce based compounds ce(rh@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3b@xmath4 and la@xmath2ce@xmath1rh@xmath3b@xmath4 , and the uranium monochalcogenides us , use and ute , which can be explained , at least at a qualitative level , with the present mechanism .",
    "we have also considered the case relevant for the iron group where the dispersion of the lower band is not negligible .",
    "the fact that the ferromagnetism is even more stable for finite values of @xmath42 when the hoppings of both bands have opposite signs indicates that our mechanism is relevant to explain the ferromagnetism of the transition metals , like ni , where a correlated and narrow @xmath5 band is hybridized with the @xmath45 band .",
