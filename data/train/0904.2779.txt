    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to arise when a very massive star collapses to a black hole , powering a hyper - relativistic outflow ( woosley 1993 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; stanek et al . 2003 ; malesani et al . 2004",
    "; woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "they are the brightest explosions in the present day universe , releasing , in a matter of few tens of seconds , a large amount of energy ( @xmath0  erg ) in the form of a hot , possibly magnetized , outflow .",
    "grbs are able to radiate a large fraction of their energy in the form of photons , with an efficiency sometimes approaching 100% ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the commonly accepted model for the dissipation of the jet energy and its conversion into radiation is the internal shock synchrotron model ( rees & meszaros 1994 ) . in this model ,",
    "differential velocities within the outflow are dissipated through collisionless shock waves that generate strong magnetic fields , accelerate a population of relativistic electrons , and eventually release synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , piran 1999 ; lloyd & petrosian 2000 ) .",
    "internal shocks suffer however from poor efficiency ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; lazzati et al . 1999 ; spada et al . 2000 ) , being capable of radiating only a few per cent of the total energy in the outflow .    in their early evolution ,",
    "the ouflows of long - duration grbs interact strongly with the cold and dense material of their progenitor star ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; aloy et al .",
    "2000 ; zhang et al . 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the interaction strongly modifies the dynamics of the jet while it is still inside the star .",
    "evaluating the effects of the jet - star interaction at larger scales , when the jet is expanding in the circum - stellar material , is of fundamental importance , since a change in the jet dynamics can profoundly affect our understanding of the dissipation and radiation processes at play in the prompt phase of gamma - ray bursts ( rees & meszaros 2005 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2007 ) .    here",
    "we present the results of a hydrodynamic simulation that follows a gamma - ray burst jet out to 65 stellar radii , where the jet material becomes transparent to radiation .",
    "our calculation shows that the interaction of the jet material with the star profoundly affects the subsequent evolution of the jet , generating continuous dissipation through transverse collimation shocks .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in   2 we present the numerical model adopted for the jet and the progenitor star , in   3 we present our result and compute light curves , and in   4 we discuss our findings .",
    "we considered a 16 solar - mass wolf - rayet progenitor star , evolved to pre - explosion ( model 16ti , woosley & heger 2006 ) .",
    "the jet was introduced as a boundary condition at a distance of @xmath1  cm from the center of the star , with a total luminosity @xmath2  erg / s , an initial opening angle @xmath3 , an initial lorentz factor @xmath4 , and a ratio of internal over rest mass energy @xmath5 , allowing for a maximum lorentz factor of @xmath6 , reachable in case of complete , non - dissipative acceleration .",
    "the jet evolution was computed with the special - relativistic hydrodynamic code flash ( fryxell et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : frames ] shows density images from three frames of the simulation at @xmath7  s , @xmath8  s , and @xmath9  s. the upper panel shows the collimating power of the stellar material .",
    "the jet that was injected with an opening angle of 10 degrees is squeezed into a 2-degree opening angle , with the typical sausage shape due to the presence of strong tangential collimation shocks ( morsony et al .",
    "this simulation extends into a box ten times bigger than any previously performed in a single run and was run for 150 seconds .",
    "the maximum spatial resolution along the jet axis was @xmath10  cm , while the maximum spatial resolution in the outer jet was @xmath11  cm . in the central and bottom panels it is possible to see that the jet remains affected by the shocks out to many stellar radii ( 20 in the central panel and about 60 in the bottom panel ) .",
    "a zoom around the jet region in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] shows the effect of the interaction of the outflow with the progenitor material more quantitatively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shocks ] ) .",
    "the head of the jet shows shocks whose normal is parallel to the jet axis and propagate along the jet ( similar to internal shocks or to the scenario of reborn fireballs , ghisellini et al .",
    "2007 ) , while the part of the jet behind the head is characterized by tangential shocks that propagate from the side of the jet to its axis and vice versa .",
    "the middle panel shows the ratio of the internal energy to the rest mass energy .",
    "the dashed blue line shows the theoretical prediction for a freely expanding outflow , neglecting the effect of the interaction with the progenitor material . in that case ,",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ratio of internal to rest energy when the jet is released at a radius @xmath14 .",
    "the red line shows the result of our simulation along the jet axis .",
    "note that the horizontal scales are equal among panels and the one to one correspondence between the shocks and the increases in internal energy .",
    "the internal energy dominates over the rest mass energy much farther out than the simple theory predicts , being @xmath15 times larger in the region between @xmath16 and @xmath17  cm .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shocks ] shows the lorentz factor along the jet spine .",
    "the opacity for thompson scattering of a relativistically moving medium is ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1991 ) : @xmath18 where the comoving density @xmath19 , the lorentz factor @xmath20 and the angle between the line of sight and the velocity of the fluid ( @xmath21 ) are evaluated at a laboratory time @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the laboratory time at which the photon is released at a radius @xmath24 .",
    "the photosphere is defined as the radius @xmath25 for which @xmath26 .",
    "knowing the photospheric radius as a function of time and angle we computed the light curve by integrating a thermal spectrum over the angular direction at the comoving temperature boosted by relativistic effects : @xmath27 where @xmath28  erg  @xmath29  k@xmath30 is the radiation constant and @xmath31 is the comoving radiation temperature , which is derived from the pressure as @xmath32 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcur ] .",
    "the photospheric light curve ( panel a ) shows an intensity and a temporal evolution fairly similar to observed grbs .",
    "it is worth noting here that the jet material is fully ionized and opacity is mainly provided by thompson scattering , with a minor contribution from free - free processes . in such conditions ,",
    "the spectrum is slightly broader than a black body ( goodman 1986 ) , but has the same peak frequency and fairly similar asymptotic behavior .",
    "in addition , a population of non - thermal particles could be present due to the shocks that keep the photosphere hot .",
    "such non - thermal electrons would create a non - thermal tail at high enrgies due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "however , if the high energy tail extend to comoving energies @xmath33  kev , photon - photon interaction may become relevant as a source of opacity for high energy photons as well as a source of electron - positron pairs that could alter the location of the photosphere ( e.g. , meszaros et al .",
    "the details of the opacity calculation depend on the assumed non - thermal tail of the spectrum . in this letter",
    ", we concentrate on the thermal emission from the photosphere and therefore the pairs are not an issue .",
    "the explanation of grb spectra extending to energies larger than @xmath34  mev require a more detailed calculation and assumptions on the spectrum of non - thermal particles that go beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the kinetic energy remaining in the jet beyond the photosphere was used to evaluate the minimum radiative efficiency .",
    "it is about 50 per cent , with an average of 56 per cent in the first 40 seconds of the light curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lcur ] , panel b ) . figure  [ fig : lcur ] , panel ( c ) , shows the photospheric radius along the jet axis as a function of time , while panel ( d ) shows the observed peak of the photospheric emission in kev .",
    "the peak of a few hundred kev seen in the simulation is typical for long - duration grbs ( kaneko et al .",
    "note that at times longer than @xmath35  s the jet enters the  unshocked jet phase \" , as discussed in morsny et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in this phase ,",
    "the photospheric efficiency drops since tangential shock are absent in the  unshocked \" phase .",
    "our simulation shows that the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the progenitor material in long duration grbs has effects that are important well after the jet has left the star .",
    "the jet does not cool and has a very bright photosphere yielding a high radiative efficiency in the prompt phase .",
    "in addition , the photospheric component is quasi - thermal ( rees & meszaros 2005 ; thompson et al . 2007 ; peer 2008 ) offering an explanation for the hard x - ray spectra in the early phase of gamma - ray bursts , which is inconsistent with synchrotron ( preece et al . 1998 , ghisellini et al .",
    "thermal components have been detected recently in batse spectra ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ; ryde et al . 2005 ; ryde & peer 2008 ) and the fermi gamma - ray telescope will soon give us a wideband view of the bursts prompt emission .",
    "non - thermal components can be added to the spectrum as a result of the reprocessing of photospheric emission and of additional dissipation due to the large inhomogeneities in the jet lorentz factor ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 ) . additional",
    "work is however required to assess the capability of this model to explain the very high - energy photons observed , e.g. , in grb  080916c ( abdo et al .",
    "unless an extremely large value of the lorentz factor of the fireball is assumed ( @xmath36 to explain photons of 10 gev ) , photons of gev energy need to be released at a radius of at least @xmath37  cm ( zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "photospheres can not be located at such large radii , even if the opacity is increased by electron - positron pair production .",
    "if the kev to mev photons of grb  080916c are from the photosphere , as we argue , a second emission mechanism is required for the gev component .",
    "kumar & barniol duran ( 2009 ) argue that the @xmath38  mev photons observed in grb  080916c must be produced in the external shock due to their temporal evolution that is different from the one of the kev to mev photons .",
    "in such a scenario , the kev to mev radiation of grb  080916c could be photospheric .",
    "it is also possible that photons of the photospheric emission are inverse compton scattered by hot electrons at large radii ( heated , e.g. , in an internal shock ) to produce a high energy tail in the gev band .",
    "our computation has two main limitations . on the one hand",
    ", it represents one single case of a jet , with given characteristics , interacting with a given star .",
    "it is not straightforward to predict how different would be the photospheric component for a different jet with a different progenitor star .",
    "based on the result of simulations of smaller domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : other ] ) we can speculate that bigger stars will produce a stronger photospheric component and that the diversity in progenitor population would explain the range of thermal to non - thermal ratios and efficiencies observed in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "higher luminosity jets are also expected to produce brighter photospheres , since they produce thicker cocoons ( aloy et al .",
    "mizuta & aloy ( 2008 ) performed a systematic study of jets into a diverse set of progenitor stars , finding that the early jet evolution is largely affected by the structure of the stellar progenitor . on the other hand",
    ", the simulation does not have a magnetic component , but is still debated whether the launching and collimation of the jet are due to magnetic effects ( e.g. , mckinney 2006 ) or not ( see , e.g. , aloy & obergaulinger 2007 ) . despite these limitations , our result opens a new window for the understanding of radiation from grb jets .",

    "we would like to thank chris fryer , ehud nakar , asaf peer , daniel proga , felix ryde , jay salmonson , and bing zhang for insightful discussions .",
