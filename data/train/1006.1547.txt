    "the vela molecular ridge ( hereinafter vmr ) is a cloud complex constituted by four giant molecular clouds @xcite , hosting large regions of active star formation ( hereinafter sf ) , in which low and intermediate mass stars are forming @xcite .",
    "its position on the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ;  @xmath5 ) makes this complex a unique laboratory for studying the sf phenomenon when the environmental conditions are those typical of the galactic disk .",
    "this is an important point to consider in extrapolating global star formation parameters to the galactic scale .",
    "indeed , the most commonly studied sf regions are projected outside the galactic plane , in part because of the observational need to minimize the source confusion .",
    "the drawback is that the global quantities derived for these regions could not be fully representative of the bulk of the sf in the galaxy .",
    "our study is focused on a particular subregion of the vela cloud complex , the so - called d cloud ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter vmr - d ) , that has already been the subject of previous papers by our group .",
    "former studies have shown a rich phenomenology associated with this cloud , involving outflows @xcite , jets @xcite , and evidences of clustered and isolated sf @xcite .",
    "after the co emission survey of the whole vmr carried out by @xcite , two maps of @xmath6  1 square degree region of vmr - d were obtained with higher resolution by @xcite ( @xmath7co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath8co(2 - 1 ) emission lines ) and @xcite ( mm dust continuum ) , aimed at studying the cloud morphology and properties as well as their relationships with the sf process active in this region ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this molecular cloud has been recently observed with both mips and irac cameras onboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and the mips aperture photometry has already been the subject of a previous work @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the analysis of the _",
    "spitzer_-irac mosaics of the vmr - d cloud , covering a region which mostly overlaps the field observed at longer wavelengths by mips and also corresponding to the sky regions already mapped in the mm spectral range and discussed in the previous papers .",
    "these new irac observations allowed us to compile a four - band photometric catalog of point sources that , complemented by the information previously obtained at longer wavelengths , constitutes a unique data bank for studying the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in this cloud . with this as our goal we have also revisited the photometric analysis of the mips 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m mosaics to obtain more accurate psf photometry .",
    "the inclusion of the longer wavelength photometry is motivated by our aim to determine , as accurately as possible , the spectral slopes of the sources , infer their evolutionary stages , and obtain a reliable statistical description of the yso population .",
    "a particularly valuable characteristic of our irac observations is that the data were collected by splitting the total integration time into two observing epochs 4.5 months apart , thereby enabling a first exploration of source variability in vmr - d .",
    "indeed we found a number of sources that clearly showed brightness variations ; they constitute a significant subsample deserving special attention , and are discussed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a brief description of the observations in   [ obse ] , we give an account of the procedure followed for source extraction and photometry for both irac and mips data in   [ photom ] . in the same section",
    "we also discuss the source selection criteria as well as the completeness and reliability .",
    "the final vmr - d point source catalog is presented in   [ thepsc ] . in   [ discussion ]",
    "we focus our attention on a subsample of 8796 sources ( out of a total of 170299 ) that have been detected in all the four irac bands and for which good quality photometry was obtained . in the following",
    "we shall refer to this subsample as the `` working sample '' . by means of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , we select the candidate ysos obtaining a census of the yso content of the vmr - d region . in the same section a brief account of the clustering properties",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   [ concl ] .",
    "the observations were carried out with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "the data were obtained as part of the spitzer / irac cycle 3 gto ( pid 30335 , pi g. fazio ) .",
    "the galactic region observed was delimited in longitude by @xmath9 and in latitude by @xmath10 , covering about 1.2 square degrees .",
    "this field corresponds to a significant portion of the vmr - d cloud that has been mapped in four spectral bands , corresponding to the four irac camera detectors observing at the wavelengths @xmath0 = 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "the effective integration time per pixel , @xmath11  s in each band , has been accumulated by splitting the observations in two epochs separated by 4.5 months , a choice mainly dictated by the desire to monitor the observed region for possible variability of the sources .",
    "the same splitting of the observation time into two epochs has also been beneficial for a better cleaning of artifacts from the final mosaics .",
    "the irac data were obtained by mapping the whole region , in each epoch , with 12@xmath1214 tiles , each observed in two dither positions .",
    "the observation was performed in irac 12  s hdr mode , consisting of two consecutive integrations of 0.4 and 10.4  s exposure times .",
    "the hdr mode was chosen to limit the saturation effects around the bright regions , a problem which is clearly present in the long exposure images in the neighborhood of the brightest sources .",
    "the data were reduced using the iracproc package ( schuster et al .",
    "2006 ) to combine the individual tiles into a flux calibrated mosaic on a pixel grid of 0.8627\" / pix .",
    "iracproc is a wrapper for the spitzer science center mosaic software mopex and provides enhanced outlier ( cosmic rays ) rejection .",
    "thus for each spectral band we obtained a total of four mosaics , one long and one short exposure for each of the two epochs .",
    "the mosaics of each epoch were subsequently coadded to obtain two final mosaics in each irac band , one with the long ( @xmath13  s ) and the other with the short ( @xmath14  s ) total exposure time . however , due to the different orientation constraints in the two observing epochs , and to the fact that the four irac cameras do not see exactly the same fields simultaneously , the images obtained in the two epochs do not fully overlap . as a consequence , in the coadded mosaic the region corresponding to the full exposure time",
    "is limited by the spatial overlap of the mosaics obtained in the two observing epochs .",
    "the final mosaics therefore include a central region , observed for the total integration time @xmath15  s , as well as adjacent surrounding regions corresponding to the non - overlapping fields that have been imaged only in one of the two epochs for a total exposure time @xmath16  s. the geometry of the mapping and the different parts covered are shown in figure  [ fig_mosaic ] . in the following we shall consider the whole region observed in the four bands , delimited in figure  [ fig_mosaic ] by the yellow contour , to produce the corresponding point source catalog , recalling that the area that has been imaged in both epochs , included in the green dashed contour , is clearly the region observed with a slightly higher s / n ratio . in producing this catalog",
    "we also take advantage of our previous observations of the vmr - d region to assess if a source falls on the mapped co - emitting cloud or not .",
    "this evaluation is important and interesting in this context because we do not have adequate off - source observations of control fields , and the archival @xmath7co observations allow us to evaluate , at least to a first approximation , the possible contamination of the on - cloud yso population by off - cloud background / foreground objects .",
    "operatively , we shall consider a source as projected on the molecular cloud , i.e. on - cloud , if it is contained within the @xmath7co contour line corresponding to the 5 k  km  s@xmath17 level in the integrated intensity map of @xcite which is shown superimposed on the irac 8  @xmath1 m mosaic in figure  [ vela_yso+co ] .",
    "clearly , this is only a necessary condition for a source to be considered for additional constraints aimed to discriminate bona fide on - cloud ysos from galactic / extragalactic contaminants .",
    "to obtain the photometric information on the point sources detected in our mosaics , we adopted the daophot @xcite photometric package .",
    "this offers a consolidated suite of algorithms aimed at detecting all the possible point - like objects whose signal is larger than a predefined threshold .",
    "the photometry was derived on our final ( two epochs combined ) mosaics .",
    "single epoch photometry was however also measured for some sources , in order to assess the reliability of our final catalog . in this section",
    "we shall describe the methods used for source detection and photometry , as well as the selection criteria adopted for compiling the vmr - d point - source catalog .",
    "completeness and reliability is also discussed and finally the mips mosaics are reconsidered to obtain a psf photometry to be used as a complement to the irac catalog .      due to the large spatial extent of our mosaics and to the presence of extended bright nebulosity , distinct ,",
    "local background intensity gradients are invariably present , so that it is not advisable to simply scan the original image with a given sensitivity threshold .",
    "the output of the detection algorithms in this case would be affected by a spatially variable sensitivity , depending on the different levels of the local background , a problem that is made even worse when strong gradients are present .    to ameliorate this difficulty we first evaluated the point spread function of our mosaics by using relatively isolated , bright , unsaturated stars , and then performed psf point - source subtractions to remove , to first order , the point - like objects . in this way we obtained images practically devoid of strong point sources , even if some residuals are clearly present .",
    "we used these images to estimate the background level across the whole field , a step that was done in each observed band by evaluating the sky value around each pixel in a square box of 51-pixel in size .",
    "this was done by using the daophot - sky procedure that estimates the modal value after clipping the outliers .",
    "note that the relatively large size adopted for the scanning box is justified by the need to include a sufficient number of sky pixels even in crowded images , as is the case particularly for the first two irac bands centered at @xmath0 = 3.6  @xmath1 m and @xmath0=4.5@xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "once the background in each band was obtained and subsequently subtracted from the original mosaics , we were left with four background - subtracted images in which the large scale gradients were strongly smoothed while the small scale noise was preserved . at this point ,",
    "the compatibility of the noise with poissonian statistics is recovered by adding the original mean sky value back onto the background subtracted images that were then used in the photometry extractions .",
    "source detection was then performed by scanning these final images with a star finding procedure which is based on a convolution with a wavelet - like filter whose spatial extent has been tuned to match the size of the point - like objects in the image .",
    "the signal produced by this convolution is then analyzed at different detection thresholds that , in our case , were taken at 5  @xmath3 and 10  @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "once we had the list of detections from the star finding algorithm , we used aperture photometry to obtain a first evaluation of the source magnitudes . although this is a relatively inaccurate method when crowding or background gradients are present in the image , it is nevertheless useful for a first estimate of source brightness , an information that was used later as a starting point for more accurate photometry .",
    "the final magnitude values were indeed obtained by means of an iterative psf - fitting procedure that , in the implementation adopted by daophot , is based on an estimate of the instrumental psf obtained from stellar images appearing relatively isolated in the frame . however , because the psf is undersampled by the irac cameras , the corresponding point response function ( prf ) that we obtain from our mosaics can not be completely accurately determined ; this produces a corresponding uncertainty in the subsequent fit to the stellar images . in spite of this difficulty , the photometry resulting from this method can be considered more accurate than the aperture photometry because the differences in fitting the prf to the stellar images remain approximately balanced between positive and negative residuals . in this way",
    "the total flux is substantially preserved , even in presence of residuals , although at the cost of an increased uncertainty in the fitting parameters ( see also @xmath18  [ completeness ] below on reliability ) .",
    "the prf we used is actually a combination of an analytic function ( in our case a lorentzian showed better results in minimizing the residuals ) and a look - up table whose aim is to compensate for systematic differences between the pure analytic function and the actual stellar images .",
    "an example of the residuals remaining after subtraction of the modeled sources from the irac mosaics is shown in figure  [ fig_subtracted ] , which illustrates this point for the two irac mosaics obtained at 3.6  @xmath1 m ( upper panels ) and the 8.0  @xmath1 m ( lower panels ) , respectively .",
    "note , however , that the knowledge of the prf also allowed us to take into account , and then correct for , the contribution to the flux of a source from wings in the brightness distribution of its neighboring sources .",
    "this advantage is fully exploited in crowded regions because the photometric values are obtained only after convergence of an iterative procedure that fits simultaneously groups of nearby stars instead of single objects .",
    "we selected the sources to be included in our catalog by applying to the photometric lists obtained from the long exposure mosaics a sequence of logical filters based on a reasonable use of the quality parameters associated with the photometric procedures .",
    "our first choice was to consider as `` good photometry sources '' only those detected above the 5  @xmath3 threshold of the background noise . to easily distinguish faint and bright sources in the catalog",
    ", we also flagged those detected above the 10  @xmath3 threshold .",
    "the daophot procedure for obtaining the point source photometry , besides evaluating the brightness , also computes two additional quantities : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , related to the goodness of the fit and to the source sharpness , respectively . here",
    "@xmath19 is evaluated as the ratio between the observed scatter in the fitting residuals and that expected on the basis of the pure image noise , and is a measure of the departure of the source image from the model prf .",
    "the sharpness parameter @xmath20 , instead , is computed as a difference between the square of the size , in pixels , of a given source and the same quantity computed for the fitting prf so that it can be used , within certain limits , as an indicator of the source angular extent .    at",
    "first we constrained these two parameters to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 to represent _ bona fide _ point - like sources ; we subsequently applied a further criterion to the flux uncertainty to select only sources with a flux relative error @xmath23 .",
    "as a third step we also considered the number of iterations needed for the prf fitting algorithm to converge on a given source : to avoid the worst cases , mainly corresponding to faint sources in crowded fields , we limited selections to those sources requiring fewer than eight iterations . finally , because the prf fitting procedure also implies a recentering of the source position , we filtered out all those sources in which the corresponding best fit centroid was displaced from the original position as evaluated in the previous detection phase by more than 1 .      despite all our efforts to select genuine point sources , the photometric lists still included many detections that , on visual inspection , are actually artifacts in the vicinity of the brightest sources .",
    "this problem affects in particular the mosaics at @xmath24  3.6  @xmath1 m and @xmath24  4.5  @xmath1 m , and is related to the so called _ muxbleed _ defect .",
    "these artifacts are recognized because they appear as a sequence of equally spaced pseudo - sources aligned along the same row containing the true bright source . because their appearance is very much like that of a train of point sources , these pseudo - sources escaped all our other selection filters so that it was necessary to eliminate them by eye . in this way",
    "more than 1000 false sources were discarded .      besides these false sources the previous selection criteria , applied to the long exposure photometry , discarded an additional , but relatively small , number of sources ( @xmath25 1000 ) . these are mainly located in regions affected by crowding or saturation , the latter case occurring especially in the neighborhood of the brightest objects . to compensate for this we also considered the short exposure mosaics , obtaining the corresponding photometry with the same procedure adopted for the long exposures .",
    "the short exposure photometry was used when , in assembling the catalog , the long exposure photometry of a given source was rejected due to one of the adopted selection criteria , as opposed to pixel replacement in the mosaic or a hard cutoff between the short and long frames . in these cases we further checked to see",
    "if alternative , short exposure photometry existed that met all the catalog constraints .",
    "if it did , we included the source in the catalog ; in this way we recovered a total of 276 sources .",
    "we also reexamined an additional 77 rejected sources , most of which ( 68 cases ) are associated with 24  @xmath1 m mips sources , that escaped irac detection because they are either so bright they suffered saturation effects or were embedded in a bright nebulosity . for most of these sources",
    "we used the short exposure mosaics to obtain the photometry even though it is more uncertain .",
    "these objects were included in the catalog to produce a list as complete as possible , even though they have been flagged as `` bad photometry '' and are not considered further in the analysis of the yso population .",
    "however the reader can use these flux densities with their uncetainties , but at the same time should be aware that the corresponding quality flags do not satisfy all the constraints previously discussed for the automatic source selection .    in conclusion , we obtained four lists of sources , one for each irac band , that have been spatially delimited to include only objects lying in the sky region surveyed in all the four irac bands as delimited by the yellow contour line in figure  [ fig_mosaic ] .      an upper limit to the completeness of our catalog",
    "is clearly set by the sensitivity detection threshold adopted in the detection phase that , we recall , was set to 5  @xmath3 .",
    "this threshold corresponds to different limiting flux densities because the background level changes with the wavelength .",
    "we evaluated the limiting flux densities in each spectral band by calculating the average value of the pixel fluctuation in the background images obtained in the course of the photometric procedure .",
    "the same limiting flux densities are independently derived from the magnitude plots of figure  [ hist_mag ] , showing the distribution of the catalog point sources as a function of their magnitude in the four irac bands . from these plots",
    "it is apparent that the logarithm of the number of sources increases proportionally to the magnitude , until the linear behaviour is lost and a fall in the number of sources is clearly seen .",
    "the vertical line drawn in each panel denotes the largest magnitude at which the catalog can be considered as complete , a value that is clearly lower than the limiting magnitude .",
    "these values are summarized in table  [ tab_lim_fluxes ] along with their corresponding flux densities .    as far as the reliability is concerned",
    ", we can exploit the fact that the vmr - d field was observed twice , allowing a check on the source detections .",
    "the criterion we adopt for this evaluation is to consider as reliable detections in a given irac band two possible cases : i ) sources detected in both observing epochs , and ii ) sources detected only once but showing at least another detection in an adjacent band . on the other hand we consider as less reliable detections case iii ) when sources were detected only once in a given band and with no detection in the adjacent bands .    to ensure that the sources we consider in estimating the reliability were observed twice , we restricted this analysis to the area delimited by the overlap of the irac mosaics from both epochs ( dashed green line in fig .",
    "[ fig_mosaic ] ) .",
    "applying to these sources the previous criteria , we obtain the distributions shown in figure  [ hist_mag ] as a dotted ( reliable ) and dashed ( unreliable ) line . from these plots",
    "we estimate the reliability as a function of the magnitude by ratioing the number of sources satisfying the criteria i ) and ii ) with the totality of the catalog sources i)+ii)+iii ) in a given band and magnitude interval . in this way",
    "we derive a reliability estimate that is always larger than 99% in the whole magnitude range .",
    "all the sources observed in both epochs show flux densities that are compatible within their uncertainities ; the very few sources ( around 0.2% ) showing a significant photometric variability have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we also reconsidered the mips observations at 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m of the vmr - d region covering a slightly larger field of approximately 1.8 square degrees ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mosaic ] ) .",
    "these observations have already been presented by @xcite who reported the aperture photometry for 849 and 61 sources in the 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m band , respectively .    however , because aperture photometry tends to be less accurate in the presence of large background gradients such as are present in the mips vmr - d mosaics , in @xcite the mips sources considered were limited to those in regions where reliable aperture photometry was possible . because psf fitting photometry is a more accurate tool , we re - analyzed the regions in the two mips mosaics of vmr - d to obtain a revised list of sources with the corresponding psf photometry .",
    "our aim was to obtain more accurate seds and then a more reliable determination of the spectral slopes characterizing the yso population .",
    "the analysis of the mips mosaics was done with the same procedures described for the irac images .",
    "first , we minimized the effects of the background variations by obtaining a rough subtraction of the point sources from the original image .",
    "after this first step eliminated most of the point source signal , the mosaics were scanned with a square box of 21 pixels on a side to produce an estimated background image .",
    "this in turn was subtracted from the original mosaic producing a flattening of the large scale gradients , thus allowing a subsequent point source detection across the field with a much more uniform sensitivity . by using a 5  @xmath3 detection criterion we obtained two preliminary lists of sources at 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m , respectively , constrained by selection criteria similar to those adopted for the catalog of the irac sources ( see   [ auto_selected ] ) .",
    "a comparison between the aperture and psf photometry methods shows that at 24  @xmath1 m the aperture photometry tends to systematically overestimate the flux by up to @xmath2550% with respect to the psf photometry .",
    "similarly , the flux differences at 70  @xmath1 m are of the same order ( @xmath26  50% ) , but they appear more erratic and without a systematic trend .    in the end , we obtained two more complete lists of sources measured with psf photometry , containing 1347 and 63 sources at 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m respectively , and we used them to supplement the irac catalog .",
    "note that among the 24  @xmath1 m sources we include for completeness six saturated objects , corresponding to irs 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , and 21 ( nomenclature from * ? ? ?",
    "in the mips catalog these correspond to the entries id=146 , 300 , 813 , 814 , 991 , 1018 , respectively , that had been flagged with negative 24  @xmath1 m flux densities , whose absolute value corresponds to the saturation limit ( 4  jy ) .",
    "we adopted angular separation as the criterion for associating the 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m sources , requiring that the corresponding centroids be within 20 ; in this way we produced a unique , merged set of sources with mips photometry .",
    "the merged mips catalog is available in electronic form ( vmr - d_mips_catalog.txt ) , and it also contains information on the possible associations of the millimeter sources as reported in previous studies .",
    "these associations are based on positional coincidences of the mips source centroid being within the beamsize of the mm observations .",
    "a short excerpt from the mips catalog is printed in table  [ tab_mips_cat ] .",
    "the histogram of the magnitudes is presented in figure  [ hist_mips ] , and it shows that the completeness flux densities are essentially the same as those quoted in @xcite , namely @xmath27  mjy at 24  @xmath1 m and @xmath28  mjy at 70  @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "some statistics of the mips sources are presented in table  [ tab_stat_mips ] .    given this new mips photometry , a re - examination of the color - magnitude diagrams in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig . 7 and 8) is in order . in figure  [ k_24 + 24_70 ]",
    "we present the resulting k vs. k-[24 ] and [ 24 ] vs. [ 24]-[70 ] diagrams while in table  [ tab_class_mips - irac ] , 2nd and 3rd columns , we report the subdivision in the different classes based on the spectral indexes derived by using the 2mass k - band magnitudes as a complement of the present mips photometry .",
    "this classification scheme is the same used in @xcite and is based on the correspondence of the colour k-[24 ] with the spectral slope of the different classes adopted by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the present results with those in @xcite , based on aperture photometry , is possible .",
    "we renormalized the values in their table 5 to reflect the changes in the total number of ysos ; because the measurement of the flux density now has changed by up to 50% , the numbers of sources in each spectral class changes as well .",
    "we note that :    * the number of mips sources detected now in the 24  @xmath1 m band is increased while at 70  @xmath1 m it remains practically the same ; * the percentage of on - cloud class i sources is now @xmath25  10% , decreased from the previously estimated value of @xmath25  30% ; * the percentage of the on - cloud flat - spectrum sources is approximately the same , @xmath25  26% , as compared with the previous estimate of @xmath25  29% ; * the percentage of on - cloud class ii objects is @xmath25  62% , an increase with respect to the previous estimate of @xmath25  37% , while class iii sources are now @xmath25  2% with respect to the previous value of @xmath25  4% .",
    "furthermore , the more accurate modeling of the point sources allows us now to obtain more reliable correspondences between the mips , irac , and 2mass objects , alleviating in this way the problem of multiple associations .    in the light of the significantly lower percentage",
    "we find here for class i spectrum sources , we conclude that our previous suggestion for an unusual excess of young objects in vmr - d does not hold up based on psf photometry , and in all future discussions of mips sources we shall refer to our current catalog .",
    "once photometry was obtained we proceeded to the positional association of the sources detected in the different spectral bands . in this phase of band merging objects detected at different irac wavelengths",
    "were considered to be associated if the relative distance of their centroids was less than 1 . for those cases",
    "in which , when comparing two bands , more than one source is found within 1 , we considered only the nearest source to be associated .",
    "the final vmr - d catalog was produced by including all of the sources detected in _ at least _",
    "one irac band which fulfill all the constraints reported in   [ sourceselection ] .",
    "an exception to this rule are the 77 sources , mainly corresponding to very bright objects , whose addition we justified in   [ additional_sources ] . to obtain a coherent list of sources , we restricted the final catalog to the field observed in all the four irac bands , namely the region delimited by the yellow contour line in figure  [ fig_mosaic ] .",
    "obviously , by construction such a catalog contains many sources lacking good photometry in some irac bands ; only 8796 sources out of the full 170,299 have accurate photometry in all four irac bands .",
    "however , because for some purposes it is useful to have flux densisites in all bands , we choose to give a flux density value in any case .",
    "this was done by reconsidering less accurate photometry previously discarded in the source extraction process ( see  [ sourceselection ] ) or , in absence of this photometry , obtaining 5  @xmath3 upper limits for the source position . consequently those missing flux densities in the catalog were recovered from the values that had been previously rejected due to the imposed constraints when the detection fall within a radius of 1  from the source position .",
    "note , however , that all these band filling flux densities have been flagged as `` bad photometry '' in the final lists , in the same way the 5  @xmath3 upper limits are reported in the catalog for those cases without a specific detection within 1 .",
    "in addition , to allow a more accurate determination of the spectral slopes and a more secure classification of the ysos , the final catalog also considers the spatial coincidence between irac and mips 24  @xmath1 m sources , and includes the mips photometry when the distance between centroids is within 6 .",
    "a larger distance , up to 20 , has been adopted for mips sources detected only at 70  @xmath1 m .",
    "these relatively large distances are close to the diffraction radius at 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m , respectively , and have been adopted to include all the potentially associated sources . of course , because the probability of the irac - mips source association decreases with the centroid distance , one must pay increasing attention when the angular distance is larger than 3and 10at 24@xmath1 m and 70@xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "note however that 70% of cases have been found within 3 . with this criterion a total of 870 mips 24  @xmath1 m sources have been associated with irac sources ; out of these , 689 are associated to a single irac source , 153 are double associations , 27 are triple , and one is associated with four irac sources . to allow the reader to evaluate these associations",
    "we also report in the catalog the distance of the centroids for each association .",
    "the published version of the catalog , available in electronic form ( vmr - d_irac_catalog.txt ) , summarizes the photometry arranging the information it in the following columns :    * column ( 1 ) : source i d .",
    "sources are sorted in ascending order of r.a . *",
    "columns(2 - 3 ) : equatorial coordinates ( j2000 ) . * columns(4 - 5 ) : galactic coordinates .",
    "* columns(6 - 7 ) : irac flux at 3.6  @xmath1 m and its uncertainty .",
    "when the flux reported is an upper limit , the uncertainty has been put to zero .",
    "* column(8 ) : quality flag , assigned as follows : the `` good photometry '' data are flagged with `` h '' ( high ) if they refer to a more than 10 @xmath3 detection , and with `` l '' ( low ) if the source is revealed between 5 and 10 @xmath3 , respectively ; in addition to this , a flag `` 2 '' or `` 1 '' indicates whether the source lies in the sky area covered in both observing epochs , or only in one of them , respectively .",
    "the `` bad photometry '' data ( see above ) are flagged with `` b '' , and upper limits with `` u '' .",

    "* hereinafter e09 ) , who also discussed the role of the extinction corrections .      in the following analysis",
    "we focus our attention on the 8796 , out of a total of 170,299 catalog sources , for which good photometry was obtained in all the four irac bands ; i.e. the working sample already defined in  [ introduction ] .",
    "in addition to this database we also consider , when available , the @xmath38-band 2mass photometry and the 24  @xmath1 m mips photometry to allow a more accurate estimate of the spectral index in the 2    24  @xmath1 m spectral interval .",
    "our first step was the determination of this spectral index @xmath31 from the linear fit of the observed @xmath39 points for all the working sample sources .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath31 values obtained are shown in the two panels of figure  [ hist_alpha ] , representing the spectral indexes for on - cloud ( upper ) and off - cloud ( lower ) sources , respectively .",
    "in the two panels the histograms are drawn separately for the objects in the working sample ( solid line ) and for the fraction of the candidate ysos ( dashed line ) that have been subsequently selected according to the criteria we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "we note that the number of objects falling within the on- and off - cloud region are quite similar ( 4484 against 4312 ) .",
    "such a fact derives from the similarity of both areas ( 0.57 against 0.60 squared deg ) and indicates that the overall population of both regions is dominated by photospheres and background / foreground objects , while the yso population possibly represents a negligible contribution .",
    "this latter is a common feature already found in surveys of other star forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , stringent criteria have to be exploited to select the candidate ysos .",
    "the ability of the irac colors to identify ysos has been studied by @xcite in the serpens cloud and by @xcite in a large number of yso clusters , and we use parts of both approaches here , augmented by criteria identifying agb contaminants from @xcite . after considering the locus of the normal reddened stars and the non - negligible extragalactic contamination , these authors suggested two statistical criteria to select candidate ysos in the [ 8 ]  vs  ( [ 4.5]-[8 ] ) col - mag diagram , namely : i ) ( [ 4.5]-[8 ] )  @xmath40  0.5 and ii ) [ 8 ]  @xmath41  14-([4.5]-[8 ] ) .",
    "this first criterion excludes the stellar component while the second , designed to statistically cut the 95% of the extragalactic objects , has been tuned by studying the extragalactic component observed with irac in the elais n1 swire region .    applying these criteria to the vmr - d cloud we select 595 yso candidates on cloud and 244 off - cloud , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , to include other potential colder candidates that could have been escaped in this diagram , we also considered further diagrams based on longer wavelength photometry , i.e. the [ 24 ]  vs  ( [ 8.0]-[24 ] ) and [ 24 ]  vs  ( [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] ) diagrams . adopting the appropriate selection criteria we included 25 more sources on and 17 off - cloud .",
    "the yso candidates selected are shown in figure  [ col_mag_col_on ] ( on - cloud ) and [ col_mag_col_off ] ( off - cloud ) as open circles and grey crosses , representing objects showing class i / flat and class ii / iii seds , respectively",
    ".    also indicated on these plots are the original selection criteria from the @xcite study of the serpens cloud .",
    "however , note that the serpens cloud ( 260 pc ) is much closer than the vmr - d cloud ( 700  pc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reflect this ,",
    "we have also indicated in the figure the region into which a candidate yso in serpens would move if displaced to the vmr - d distance .",
    "the region between the two inclined parallel lines can then be regarded as potentially containing both candidate ysos and extragalactic contaminants meaning that objects in this region should be more accurately studied to ascertain their nature . here",
    "we conservatively consider only sources delimited by the original criteria represented by the dashed lines in figure  [ col_mag_col_on ] and [ col_mag_col_off ] .    in the same figure the two color ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] )",
    "vs ( [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] ) diagram is also shown in the upper right panel with the same meaning of the symbols , and with a square box that is drawn to show the approximate locus of the class ii sources according to @xcite .",
    "the irregular area delimited by the dot - dashed line is the locus of the agb stars in this diagram , according to @xcite . for comparison , in a separate figure  [ col_mag_col_off ]",
    ", we show the same diagrams drawn for the off - cloud sources .    with the aim to obtain a list of candidate ysos as clean as possible from contaminants we also adopted further criteria recently discussed and summarized by @xcite .",
    "these have been derived for identifying as likely contaminants those sources satisfying a series of constraints flagging star - forming galaxies and agn , as well as shock excited knots that can mimic point sources in star forming environments .",
    "these are based on color - color diagrams as [ 4.5]-[5.8 ]  vs  [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] , [ 3.6]-[5.8 ]  vs  [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] , and [ 3.6]-[4.5 ]  vs  [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] , as well as on the color - magnitude [ 4.5 ] vs [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] diagram .    in figure  [ col_mag_col_onexclu ]",
    "we present these diagrams ( displayed for simplicity only on - cloud ) for the sources emerging from the previous selection step that are reported with crosses and circles in figure  [ col_mag_col_on ] . considering the constraints in @xcite we flagged 64 sources , 42 on ( shown as open squares ) and 22 off - cloud , respectively , that have then been eliminated from our list of candidate ysos .    as a further check we also applied to this list the irac based criteria of @xcite for finding agb contaminants , identifying in this way 115 sources on - cloud",
    "( 112 showing a class iii sed ) and 65 off - cloud ( 62 showing a class iii sed ) . also these sources have been eliminated from the final list .    at the end of this process",
    "we remain with 637 irac selected candidate yso sources , 463 on and 174 off - cloud that we assign to a specific class simply considering their spectral slope as derived considering all the available data in the 2    24  @xmath1 m spectral interval .",
    "these sources have been used to draw the dash - dotted histogram in figure  [ hist_alpha ] .",
    "the corresponding distribution in classes of these candidate ysos is shown in 4th and 5th column of table  [ tab_class_mips - irac ] .",
    "the analysis presented above allowed us to classify the vmr - d young population and it is interesting to compare our results to those obtained by _",
    "spitzer _ for other sf regions .",
    "these have been summarized and analyzed in a consistent way by and we adopted it for the vmr - d comparison . however , because our method for selecting the ysos is not exactly the same as that of , before to compare our results it is desirable to evaluate the effects produced by applying our pipeline at least to one of the five clouds considered by .",
    "the serpens cloud is probably the most appropriate for this check : it is projected near the galactic plane and has been scrutinized with accurate spectroscopic follow - up aimed to identify agb contaminants @xcite . for this cloud",
    "we do not attempted to select candidate ysos out of the full catalog , delivered by the c2d legacy project and made available at the _ spitzer _ science center , because our selection criteria are similar to those used to obtain the c2d yso list .",
    "the difference in our approach is mainly in the identification of the contaminants so that we used the serpens yso catalog to analyze with our procedure the 262 sources listed . applying our pipeline , based on the @xcite criteria , to this list",
    "we exclude a total of 14 sources .",
    "none of these is in the list of the 78 candidate ysos scrutinized by @xcite and their distribution in classes is : two sources in class i , two are flat - spectrum , eight in class ii , and two in class iii . despite we exclude these 14 sources out of the 262 in the serpens yso catalog ,",
    "we note that after their subtraction from the numbers quoted in and reported in table  [ tab_stat_yso ] , the relative distribution in classes remains practically the same and also the star formation rate is not significantly affected . in the limit of this indication",
    "we can compare in table  [ tab_stat_yso ] the results obtained for vmr - d with those provided by , noting that in the numbers quoted for the ysos in serpens the sources identified as agb by @xcite have been already subtracted .    in this table the rows 13",
    "consider the sources selected by means of the @xcite criteria and shown in fig .",
    "[ col_mag_col_on ] and [ col_mag_col_off ] . the subsequent rows",
    "46 report the results obtained after filtering the sources in the first three rows with more stringent criteria for eliminating extragalactic and galactic contaminants @xcite as illustrated in fig .  [ col_mag_col_onexclu ] .",
    "further three rows , namely 79 , are used to present the results obtained after applying to the first three rows the correction for contaminants suggested by @xcite on the basis of their spectroscopic investigations of the serpens yso population selected with the @xcite criteria .    indeed ,",
    "because serpens is a sf region quite close to galactic plane ( @xmath42 5@xmath43 ) , it is reasonable to assume that its level of contamination of agb and giant stars is comparable to that of vmr - d .",
    "the sample of ysos in serpens is contaminated by background giants to a level of about 25% so that , by applying the same correction to our vmr - d on and off - cloud sample , we obtain the statistics given in table  [ tab_stat_yso ] , lines 79",
    ". note that in this case we do not report the distribution in classes because the 25% contamination is referred to the total number of ysos .",
    "in the subsequent lines 1014 we also report for comparison the values of the corresponding quantities quoted by for chaii , lupus , perseus , serpens , and ophiucus .",
    "in each line we give the investigated area , the adopted cloud distance , the total number of ysos found , the surface density per solid angle and per square parsec , the number of objects of type class i , flat - spectrum , class ii , and class iii , respectively , and finally the derived star formation rate .",
    "first of all we recall that , differently from these other sf regions , vmr - d is located in the galactic plane and it is also from 2 to 5 times farther away . as already mentioned , the latter circumstance imposes a larger value for the limiting luminosity ( typically 0.1 l@xmath44 instead of , e.g. , 0.004 l@xmath44 for the taurus ) resulting in significant contamination from stars ; conversely , it offers the opportunity to study the sf process where the mass reservoir is the largest available .    as a rough first approximation",
    ", we consider the off - cloud statistics as representative of the average population of the galactic plane and , as such , it could be subtracted from the on - cloud statistics after weighting for the different areas , in this way estimating the uncontaminated young population of vmr - d . by doing this",
    "we obtain the lines 3 , 6 , and 9 , of table  [ tab_stat_yso ] , with the caution that the off - cloud region could be active in sf as suggested by the the histograms in figure  [ hist_alpha ] , albeit at a lower level .",
    "because of this and of the larger luminosity limit , the numbers reported here for the ysos should actually be considered lower limits .",
    "however , taken at their face value , they suggest an excess of class iii ( @xmath2522% ) and a deficit of class ii objects ( @xmath2548% ) with respect to the other sf regions . the cause of the apparent excess of class iii might be either evolution - the vela cloud is older than these others - or due to uncorrected contamination of agb stars .    considering the statistics corrected for extragalactic and galactic contaminants , reported in the 4th and 6th lines , make the distribution in classes of the ysos in vmr - d resemble more that seen in serpens and ophiuchus rather than in other sf regions .",
    "differences actually exist in the class ii / iii relative ratios , but they probably stem from an incomplete correction since vmr - d is more embedded in the plane than is serpens .",
    "if we try to account for such discrepancies , we can reasonably rule out evolutionary effects since the relatively large fraction of class iii sources in vmr - d does not reflect a particularly small fraction of class i and flat - spectrum sources that instead appear relatively numerous .",
    "moreover , if we calculate the sf rate per square parsec , by assuming a mean mass of 1 @xmath45 , a fraction of binary of 0.5 and a period of 2 myr for sf , we obtain for the vmr - d sf rate @xmath6 2.54.1 m@xmath44myr@xmath17pc@xmath46 , a range of values that is more consistent with that of the younger clouds like serpens , ophiucus , and perseus , than it is for the smaller corresponding values obtained for lupus and chamaleon .",
    "it is also noteworthy that adopting the corrections suggested by @xcite we obtain ( tab .",
    "[ tab_stat_yso ] , lines 68 ) very similar results to those obtained after considering the set of criteria discussed in   [ source_selection ] to exclude likely contaminants ( lines 46 ) .",
    "this adds some confidence in the present results",
    ".    given these observational indications it seems plausible to consider the vmr - d age as being in the range 12 myr , in good agreement with the dynamical time estimate of 1.5 myr derived by @xcite for vmr - d and comparable to the estimates for perseus @xcite and serpens @xcite . within the previous assumptions , and given the solid angle subtended by our on - cloud region , it is easy to estimate that approximately 200300 m@xmath47 myr@xmath17 are converted into stars in the investigated region . because the cloud mass has been estimated at @xmath48 m@xmath47 @xcite , we can also derive the depletion time for the cloud , that is @xmath49  4070 myr , as well as the sf efficiency given by m@xmath50/(m@xmath51m@xmath52)@xmath6  0.020.03 .",
    "however , the uncertainty associated to the estimate of the cloud mass is at least @xmath53 so that these quantities are correspondingly uncertain .",
    "we have seen that the irac data are an essential , additional ingredient of ysos classification , and by including them we have been able to reconcile ( as indeed was anticipated by @xcite ) the estimated excess of class i objects previously derived using only mips aperture photometry .    in this section",
    "we want to briefly discuss the young population census , as obtained by means of the present irac photometry complemented with 2mass and mips data , with the results that can be derived using only 2mass and mips photometry .",
    "the aim is to assess the ability of the mips photometry to correctly classify ysos when no irac data are available , as is the case for the mips regions without overlap with the irac mosaics ( see fig .  [ fig_mosaic ] ) .",
    "the classification method used in these two cases is different : in the first case the 2mass / irac / mips photometric data are used to evaluate the spectral slope @xmath31 and to separate candidate ysos from contaminants , while in the second case only 2mass / mips data are used to exploit the k@xmath54 vs. k@xmath54-[24 ] diagram as in @xcite .",
    "the first method is clearly the most appropriate involving more photometric information ( up to six wavelengths ) ; however , being the second method the alternative choice when mips observations are the only available , it is interesting to check if differences arise in selecting the yso population with these two methods .",
    "the two lists of candidate ysos obtained with these two approaches are reported in the corresponding electronic catalogs : vmr - d_irac_yso.txt and vmr - d_mips_yso.txt .",
    "typical entries for both are reported in table  [ tab_irac_yso ] and [ tab_mips_yso ] , respectively . in discussing the differences emerging between these two approaches",
    "we shall limit ourselves to consider only the corresponding lists of class i objects ; similar comparisons for the other classes ( flat , ii or iii ) follow the same line of thinking . before proceeding , we reiterate that the census of the different classes in this paper is based on the working sample , i.e. is limited to those sources with valid fluxes in all four irac bands .",
    "this clearly excludes the sources with an upper limit , a large flux uncertainty , or even a not strictly point - like shape in at least one irac band .",
    "these objects , although not considered here , are included in the general catalog and could represent interesting targets for future investigations .",
    "the 49 sources selected as class i objects by scrutinizing the irac catalog working sample are listed in table  [ tab_irac_yso_ci ] . along with the source i d ,",
    "coordinates and spectral index , we also report the presence of a counterpart in other bands : k@xmath54 - 2mass in column  5 and mips bands in columns  6  to  8 .",
    "this information is needed to compare the two methods since the mips classification is based on k@xmath54 - 2mass and 24  @xmath1 m magnitudes , and only irac sources associated with both these ancillary data are subject to both irac and mips classification . by looking at table  [ tab_irac_yso_ci ] ( column 9 ) , we see that only five sources out of the 49 entries were classified with mips and all of these are class i ( flag i ) . while this is the expected result when the four irac points are reasonably well aligned with the two extreme spectral points at k@xmath54 and 24  @xmath1 m , it is however noteworthy that in the relatively few cases in which both methods can be applied they give the same classification . in columns 10 and 11",
    "we also indicate whether the source is associated with gas and dust emission . in this respect , the genuine nature of the selected class i sources is testified by the fact that 44 out of the 49 sources are coincident with gas clumps or peaks .",
    "the remaining 5 sources are located in regions not covered by the @xmath7co map ( flag n ) .",
    "finally , the last column indicates whether we find that the source is also irac variable on a timescale of 4.5 months @xcite ; we identify six cases of variability .",
    "table  [ tab_mips_yso_ci ] is complementary to table  [ tab_irac_yso_ci ] .",
    "it provides the list of all the 20 sources classified as class i based on k@xmath54 - 2mass and 24  @xmath1 m photometry .",
    "besides the k@xmath54 - 24 index ( column  4 ) information is also given about the presence of a 70 @xmath1 m counterpart ( column  5 ) .",
    "the association with an irac counterpart is indicated in column  6 while column  7 reports the quality flags of the detections in the four irac bands . since this classification",
    "is determined by mips , there are only seven sources ( see column  8) contained in the irac working sample , while 11 further sources are associated with irac objects lacking good photometry in one or more bands .",
    "the remaining two sources do not have a counterpart in the irac catalog ( see the notes to table  [ tab_mips_yso_ci ] ) .",
    "five objects in this table are clearly in common with table  [ tab_mips_yso_ci ] but there are two more cases included in the working sample and classified as flat - spectrum sources when we derive the spectral slope exploiting the irac data .",
    "this suggests that the classification independently provided by k@xmath54 - 2mass / mips and k@xmath54 - 2mass / irac / mips is not completely equivalent even if the two methods seem to be in agreement in five out of the seven common cases encountered .",
    "again , most of these sources are located in gas clumps .",
    "note also that table  [ tab_mips_yso_ci ] contains many sources whose irac flags do not fulfill our compelling requirements ( only h1 and h2 quality flags ) . although they are not members of the working sample , they are nonetheless good candidates for very young protostars .    finally , for the sake of completeness , we present in table  [ tab_mips_remark ] a list of mips selected sources that , for various reasons , can be considered as particularly red or cold .",
    "when observed in both mips bands , these objects have a color [ 24]-[70 ] @xmath40 6.3 , a condition we imposed to select the coldest ( t @xmath41 50k ) sources ( see figure  [ k_24 + 24_70 ] , right panel ) .",
    "other sources listed in table  [ tab_mips_remark ] are : _ i _ ) the 70 @xmath1 m sources with point - like appearance but without a 24  @xmath1 m counterpart ; _ ii _ ) the objects saturated at 24  @xmath1 m , but already classified as iras class i objects ( liseau et al .",
    "note that increasing the angular distance of the association , reported in column 7 , the uncertainty also increases so that further analysis is required to confirm a genuine source association .",
    "the spatial distribution of the young stars provides useful information about sf mechanisms in the cloud , since ysos do not move very far from their birthplaces during the pms evolution .",
    "much of the accumulated observational evidence suggests that stars prefer to form in groups , and in particular , that the two - point correlation function of young stars shows a different behaviour at small and large spatial scales , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more recently @xcite analyzed the spatial distribution of the ysos in 36 clusters by means of both the nearest neighbor and the minimum spanning tree method .",
    "a critical length , in the range @xmath25 0.10.5  pc , could be identified in the cumulative distribution of the source spacings indicating differences in the slope at small and large spatial scales .",
    "we use here the function @xmath55 to quantify the degree of the ysos clustering in the vmr - d cloud : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the average number of pairs with angular separation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 around each object , and @xmath60 is the same number expected for a random distribution of the same sources . for sf regions ,",
    "this function for pms objects typically shows a power law behaviour @xmath61 , but with clearly different exponents for small ( @xmath62 ) and large ( @xmath63 ) spatial scales , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this fact has been interpreted as an indication of a critical scale that separates the regime of binary and multiple stars , at smaller scales , from the hierarchical clustering dominating at larger scales .",
    "@xcite also suggested that this scale could represent the jeans length of the molecular cloud , although this interpretation encounters difficulties in explaining the different length scales observed in taurus , ophiuchus and trapezium clusters @xcite .",
    "we applied the @xmath55 statistics to our candidate ysos selected among the vmr - d working sample sources ( see   [ yso_class ] ) ; that is , those sources satisfying the criteria for minimizing the presence of galactic and extragalactic contaminants illustrated in   [ source_selection ] and figures  [ col_mag_col_on ] , [ col_mag_col_off ] , and [ col_mag_col_onexclu ] . the spatial distribution of these sources is presented in figure  [ vela_yso+co ] where the objects of class i / flat ( red circles ) and class ii / iii ( green crosses ) are shown superposed to the 8.0 @xmath1 m irac mosaic .",
    "we find substantial differences between clustering in early and late classes as is shown in figure  [ acf ] where we present the behaviour of the @xmath55 function for class i and flat - spectrum ( left panel ) , and class ii and iii sources ( right panel ) , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that in both cases the correlation function behaves as a single power law , at least in the investigated range of scales , but with noticeably different slopes denoting a higher degree of clustering of the younger classes with respect to the later evolutionary stages .",
    "this can be also qualitatively seen by eye from the spatial distributions in figure  [ vela_yso+co ] .",
    "note , however , that in the range of the investigated spatial scales , there is no break in the power law slope within each region ; this is significant even though a direct comparison with the cases discussed in @xcite for optically selected pms stars is not straightforward because here we deal with irac selected ysos instead of optically selected pms stars .",
    "a more appropriate comparison can be done with @xcite who show the behavior of the same @xmath55 function computed for the distribution of the ysos in serpens ( their figure 10 ) .",
    "the slopes they found for both class i / flat and class ii / iii sources are remarkably similar to those shown in figure  [ acf ] for vmr - d sources .",
    "a possible difference may be due to a trend in serpens toward smaller scales due to a flattening of the function at scales smaller than @xmath64 au .",
    "a plausible justification for the different slopes of early and late ysos is simply that it is due to the different ages of the two populations .",
    "it is generally accepted that stars are essentially formed in clusters , so that it is naturally expected that the older objects have moved from their birthplaces , producing object dispersal we measure in the shallower slope of the correlation function for class ii / iii sources .",
    "finally in figures  [ thumb_16_17 ] and [ thumb_19_20 ] we show more details of the four regions around irs16 , 17 , 19 , and 20 , including the spatial distributions of the class i / flat ( red circles ) and class ii / iii ( green crosses ) located within 4@xmath65 . to produce these figures",
    ", we consider an enlarged sample containing all the catalog sources located around the irs objects and with good photometry in at least two adjacent irac bands .",
    "this allows us to compensate for the relative scarcity in these small areas of candidate ysos selected from our working sample and then to better highlight the trend in the spatial distribution of the different classes .",
    "the sources reported here have been selected from this enlarged sample by applying the same criteria discussed in   [ source_selection ] and illustrated in figure  [ col_mag_col_on ] , [ col_mag_col_off ] , and [ col_mag_col_onexclu ] . in doing this",
    "we discarded the sources with upper limits and considered only those cases for which at least a bad photometry was obtained in the two complementary irac bands .    in all cases",
    "we see that around these four irs objects the class i / flat sources ( red circles ) are not uniformly distributed .",
    "they appear more abundant around irs16 and irs17 ; class ii / iii objects ( green crosses ) are instead more numerous and more simmetrically distributed in irs16 , 19 , and 20 .",
    "an exception is irs17 where the class ii / iii objects follow the same elongated distribution of the class i / flat sources .",
    "we also note that this configuration in irs17 is suggestive of the presence of two separated clusters as has also been suggested by @xcite . speculating on this case ,",
    "we suggest that a dust disk , whose plane is perpendicular to the observed ysos distribution , may be responsible for this appearance ; this is suggested also by the central dark lane visible in all the irac bands .",
    "it is however clear that a conclusion can not be given here and further investigations are needed .",
    "this paper presents the analysis of the _",
    "spitzer_-irac mosaics obtained in the region of the vela molecular ridge , cloud d. in a @xmath6  1.2 square degrees area , corresponding to the overlap of the irac mosaics in the four bands , we obtained the photometry that has been used to compile a four - band point source catalog .",
    "this has been supplemented by relevant information at longer wavelengths from revised photometry of the vmr - d mips mosaics and from previously published millimeter line and continuum observations of the same region .",
    "this catalog has been used to outline the general characteristics of the ysos in this sf region .",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "the vmr - d irac point source catalog has been compiled with 170,299 entries , 8796 of which , constituting our working sample , have good quality fluxes in all four irac bands .",
    "complementary information has been also added using a revised , psf - based , mips 24  @xmath1 m and 70  @xmath1 m photometry and previous millimeter observations obtained in both co lines and dust continuum .",
    "2 .   a revised catalog containing the point sources extracted from the vmr - d mips 24  @xmath1 m and",
    "70  @xmath1 m mosaics has been also obtained following the same photometric procedure adopted for the irac bands .",
    "the working sample has been analyzed according to the spectral slope that was obtained by also considering both the k@xmath54 - 2mass and the mips 24  @xmath1 m fluxes when available .",
    "we selected the candidate ysos by means of their position in color - color and color - magnitude diagrams involving irac and mips photometry ; the likely contaminants due to extragalactic and galactic objects have been also estimated and excluded from the final list of ysos constituted by 637 objects .",
    "the candidate ysos have been used to evaluate the surface density ( 3.35.5 pc@xmath46 ) , the star formation rate ( 2.54.1 m@xmath47myr@xmath17pc@xmath46 ) and efficiency ( @xmath6  0.020.03 ) , and the depletion time ( 4070 myr ) of the vmr - d cloud .",
    "the global clustering properties of the ysos , studied by means of the two point correlation function , have been found to be very similar to those derived by @xcite for the serpens sf region ; it clearly shows that class i / flat sources are more clustered than class ii / iii sources .",
    "the irac catalog sources around irs16 and irs17 show a larger fraction of class i / flat seds with respect to irs19 and irs20 where the class ii / iii objects are relatively more numerous . in the irs17 region",
    "there is a tendency for the class ii / iii to trace the same elongated distribution of the class i / flat sources .",

    "<S> a total of 170,299 point sources , detected at the 5 @xmath3 sensitivity level in at least one of the irac bands , have been reported in the catalog . there were 8796 sources for which good quality photometry was obtained in all four irac bands . for this sample , a preliminary characterization of the young stellar population based on the determination of spectral slope </S>",

    "<S> the main differences in their relative abundances have been highlighted and a brief account for their spatial distribution is given . the star formation rate has been also estimated and compared with the values derived for other star forming regions . finally , an analysis of the spatial distribution of the sources by means of the two - point correlation function shows that the younger population , constituted by the class i and flat - spectrum sources , is significantly more clustered than the class ii and iii sources . </S>"
