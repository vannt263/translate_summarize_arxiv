    "two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in @xmath1 heterostructures can reach mobilities exceeding @xmath2 at low temperatures , facilitating the observation of fascinating phenomena like the microwave - induced zero - resistance states , the @xmath3 quantum hall state , and interactions between composite fermions  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that to this end , clean materials and growth techniques beyond the standard modulation doping approach are essential  @xcite . however , current growth protocols are apparently in conflict with the in situ control of the 2deg s density via schottky - gates : recent experiments on gated high - mobility structures have reported hysteresis effects and temporal drifts when biasing schottky gates @xcite . in order to investigate the origin of these effects , we fabricate gated hall bars containing a high - mobility 2deg .",

    "the overall growth scheme is similar as previously reported @xcite .",
    "two si - donor layers are situated at depths @xmath6 of about @xmath7 and @xmath8 in order to compensate for surface - states and background impurities in the substrate .",

    "the ground state in the alas wells ( @xmath15-minima ) is lower than that in the gaas wells ( @xmath10 minima ) .",
    "consequently , only a part of the donors free electrons reside in the high - mobility 2deg , whereas the rest is expected to populate the @xmath15-band within the alas - layers embedding the doping planes  @xcite .",
    "the investigated samples stem from different wafers with the same layer structure . typical transport characteristics of unprocessed samples are a drude mobility @xmath16 at an electron density @xmath17 as measured in van - der - pauw geometry at a temperature of @xmath18 ( data not shown ) .    the samples are etched @xmath19 deep to define a @xmath20 wide hall bar .",

    "again , gate voltages corresponding to the electron density @xmath74 are marked by red circles .",
    "these voltages match the values from figure  [ fig : density ] ( a ) , implying that the classical hall density matches the quantum hall density and no populated second subband or other parallel conducting channels contribute to the measured electron densities within experimental accuracy , as confirmed by zero resistance minima in shubnikov - de - haas data ( not shown ) . for both measurements ,",
    "as long as the 2deg density is being reduced , @xmath51 is not linear with respect to the gate bias .",

    "this qualitative difference indicates that charge redistributes in the region between gate and 2deg during depletion but not during accumulation of the 2deg .    figure  [ fig : time ] ( a ) shows the electron density of another sample with the same heterostructure layer sequence , measured at @xmath61 and temperature @xmath82 .",

    "again , the electron density shows a strong hysteresis between depletion ( blue ) and accumulation ( black ) of the 2deg . interrupting the gate - sweep during depletion and waiting for two hours results in an increased electron density ( blue circles ) .",
    "in contrast , the same procedure during accumulation shows that the electron density is stable for at least one hour during accumulation ( black circles ) .",
    "the finding implies that the charge redistribution is complete at gate biases @xmath85 and is stable in time afterwards . as a comparison",
    ", the temporal evolution of the electron density during depletion is shown in figure  [ fig : time ] ( b ) . stopping the gate - sweep at one of the gate voltages @xmath84 results in a slow recovery of the electron density .",
    "a probable origin of the observed charge redistributions is the charging of the @xmath86 layer @xmath32 beneath the surface and/or the @xmath15-electrons at @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the observed hysteresis resembles the memory - like behaviour in 2deg samples with vertically tunnel coupled self - assembled quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the layers would build up positive charge during depletion up to full ionisation at very negative gate voltages @xmath85 . according to the calculation of the band structure in figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] ( a )",
    ", electrons would not be able to repopulate the layers unless a sufficiently positive gate bias is applied . in the gate - sweeps in figures  [ fig : density ] and [ fig : time ] , such a reset of the 2deg s density is indeed observed when ramping the gate voltage up to @xmath87 .",
    "the more drastic reset at @xmath82 ( figure  [ fig : time ] ) indicates that the time constant of the associated charge redistribution is temperature dependent .",
    "different charge configurations of the doping layers are expected to have a strong impact on the drude mobility @xmath88 of the 2deg , where @xmath89 is the longitudinal potential drop and @xmath90 is the aspect ratio of the hall bar . figure  [ fig : mobility ] shows the mobility , plotted as a function of the electron density @xmath51 at @xmath61 , @xmath62 during a gate - sweep from @xmath57 to @xmath60 and back to @xmath57 .",

    "the mobility while depleting ( blue ) is much higher than when accumulating ( black ) .",
    "for example at @xmath63 ( red circles ) , the mobilities are found to be @xmath92 ( depleting ) and @xmath93 ( accumulating ) , respectively .",
    "grey lines are fits of a power - law dependence @xmath94 to the data yielding exponents of @xmath95 ( depleting ) and @xmath96 ( accumulating ) . ]    while depleting , the mobility is clearly larger than during accumulation at any given density ( e.g. , @xmath97 as compared to @xmath98 at @xmath99 , red circles ) . when accumulating , a recovery of the mobility sets in at electron densities @xmath100 , corresponding to gate voltages @xmath101 .    for temperatures of @xmath102",
    ", we find that the mobility is independent of temperature ( measurement not shown ) , indicating that phonon scattering is not relevant for the interpretation of this gate - sweep .",
    "the fit of a power - law dependence @xmath103 to the data yields exponents of @xmath95 ( depleting ) and @xmath96 ( accumulating )  , @xmath104 during depletion and @xmath105 , @xmath106 during accumulation ] .",
    "such dependence is commonly associated with remote impurity scattering of ionised donor atoms  @xcite and is in contrast to @xmath107 found in background - impurity - limited 2degs  @xcite .    from the strong positive @xmath51-dependence of our sample s mobility",
    "it can be concluded that the dominant scatterers are characterized by a potential @xmath108 whose fourier transform @xmath109 diminishes strongly when @xmath110 is increased .",
    "the significantly larger exponent @xmath111 and the higher mobility during depletion suggest that during depletion , the disorder potential is steeper in @xmath110-space , corresponding to a smoother ( long - range-)potential in real space .",
    "the observed decrease of the mobility with decreasing electron density could be caused by several effects :    1 .   decreasing the electron density increases the fermi - wavelength .",
    "this in turn facilitates scattering events that arise from the long - range part of the disorder potential  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15-electrons , which screen the dopants disorder potential at @xmath37 , are depleted at sufficiently negative gate bias .",
    "the loss of the screening layer might have a strong impact on the 2deg s mobility .",
    "3 .   during depletion , dopants between gate and 2deg become ionised which leads to increased remote ionised impurity scattering .",
    "4 .   at more negative gate biases ( and hence lower densities ) , the confinement potential of the 2deg is more strongly tilted . in this situation ,",
    "the weight of the 2deg s wave function is situated closer to the lower algaas - barrier , increasing alloy scattering and interface roughness scattering  @xcite .",
    "the observation of different mobilities at the same density can not be related to the first effect , because the fermi wavelength is the same in both cases . in order to test the impact of ionised donors above the 2deg onto the mobility ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the mobility is shown in figure  [ fig : mobility_wait ] .",
    "( colour online ) mobility @xmath91 as a function of the 2deg s electron density @xmath51 measured at @xmath61 and @xmath82 .",
    "the mobility during depletion ( blue ) is much higher than during accumulation ( black ) . stopping the gate - sweep at @xmath112 and waiting for two hours ( lower red trace ) results in a gradual increase of the mobility and density along the depletion - trace .",
    "the same behaviour is observed when stopping at @xmath99 and waiting for 14 hours ( upper red trace ) .",
    "if the gate - sweep is stopped during accumulation , the sample s density and mobility do not change over time . ]",
    "the mobility is measured at a temperature of @xmath82 ( compared to @xmath62 in figure  [ fig : mobility ] ) in order to speed up the relatively slow process of ionisation . as a consequence ,",
    "the dependence of the mobility on the density is almost linear due to enhanced phonon scattering  @xcite , but still the mobility is higher during depletion than during accumulation . during depletion ( blue ) , the gate - sweep is stopped and the change of the sample s density and mobility are recorded . starting from @xmath113 ( lower red trace ) or @xmath114 ( upper red trace ) , both the density and mobility increase over time .",
    "the evolution follows the depletion curve , indicating that the progressing ionisation acts primarily as a positive gate bias and does not determine the mobility at a given electron density .",
    "this leads us to believe that the drastic change of the mobility after fully depleting the 2deg is not due to changes of the charge states of the screening layer at @xmath34 or the doping layer at @xmath115 , but rather due to the screening layer at @xmath116 . after depleting both the 2deg and this lower screening layer ,",
    "more positive charge is present beneath the 2deg , increasing interface roughness scattering and alloy scattering due to a more tilted confinement potential .",
    "additionally , the loss of this screening layer should increase the 2deg s remote ionised impurity scattering with dopants beneath the 2deg .",
    "the latter effect might be weaker than the effect of a tilted potential , because the mobility shown in figure  [ fig : mobility ] does not show a drastic decrease at the gate voltage corresponding to the expected depletion of the upper screening layer .",
    "the finding implies that the bottom screening layer can not be refilled laterally ( from non - depleted areas of the hall bar ) but requires vertical tunnelling or an additional activation energy to regain its original @xmath15-electron density . in order to test this interpretation , the response of the electron density to illumination with an infrared light emitting diode (",
    "ir - led ) is investigated . according to the bandstructure calculation shown in figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] ( a )",
    ", the conduction band edge of the doping layers between top gate and 2deg is above the fermi energy for gate voltages @xmath117 .",
    "hence , we expect an increase of the electron density in the 2deg if the led affects these doping layers by facilitating further ionisation .",
    "in contrast , the band edge of the screening layer at @xmath12 is situated below the fermi energy as long as the 2deg is populated .",
    "if the led resets the positively charged bottom screening layer , the electron density of the 2deg should decrease .",
    "figure  [ fig : led ] shows the electron density at @xmath61 , @xmath82 , plotted as a function of gate voltage .",
    "( colour online ) electron density @xmath118 as a function of gate voltage , measured at @xmath61 , @xmath82 .",
    "there is a strong hysteresis between depleting ( blue curve ) and accumulating of the 2deg ( black curve ) .",
    "the vertical ( red ) lines show the density change during @xmath119 of ir - led illumination with a current of @xmath120 at gate voltages of @xmath121 . during illumination",
    ", the density converges towards the value observed during depletion . ]",
    "sweeping the gate bias from @xmath57 to @xmath59 ( blue curve ) and back to @xmath57 ( black ) creates again a strong density hysteresis . when the gate - sweep is stopped during accumulation and the ir - led",
    "is switched on by applying a current of @xmath120 , the density decreases over time , implying that indeed a repopulation of the screening layer at @xmath12 is observed .",
    "vertical red lines at voltages @xmath121 show that the density decreases almost towards the depletion value during @xmath122 of illumination , rather than approaching the value after waiting ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this suggests that some photo - generated electrons get trapped in the upper screening layer .",
    "indeed , once the led is switched off , a slow increase of the electron density is observed ( data not shown ) , being consistent with the time dependencies shown in figure 3 .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated gating effects in high - mobility 2degs . it is found that a gate - induced ionisation of the doping layers between top - gate and 2deg causes a significant hysteresis in the electron density .",
    "surprisingly , this ionisation has almost no impact on the 2deg s mobility at a given electron density . on the other hand , the depletion of the screening layer beneath the 2deg is found to decrease the mobility by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this drastic effect can be explained by a reduced screening of dopants and a shift of the 2deg s wave function towards its lower algaas boundary .",
    "our finding indicates that for gatable high - mobility 2degs , it is important to keep the 2deg wave function in the center of the quantum well which could for example be achieved through a buried back gate . at the same time",
    "any possible screening from x - electrons needs to be ( and can be ) sacrificed in order to achieve large density tunability .",
