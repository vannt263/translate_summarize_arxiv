    "over the last few years , the study of thermalization in heavy - ion collisions using statistical models has been extended to sps @xcite and rhic @xcite energies , allowing the so - called  freeze - out curve \" @xcite of hadronic matter to be extended close to the @xmath2 axis of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "this is an important development in the search for the quark gluon plasma because it allows a more direct comparison between lattice qcd calculations of the phase boundary temperature @xcite , performed mostly at zero baryon density , and experiment - based methods for measuring the equilibriun temperature on the hadronic side of the phase boundary ( if the system equilibrates ) .",
    "the updated phase diagram presented at this conference by braun - munzinger @xcite suggests a scenario in which the final - state composition of the system , determined at chemical freeze - out , relies less on hadronic rescattering processes @xcite as the beam energy is increased .",
    "this effect arises due to two reasons : stronger transverse flow causes faster expansion of the system , allowing less time for inelastic interactions ; and the hadronic phase is bounded above by the temperature of the phase boundary itself , meaning that the system cools very little between hadronization and freeze - out .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that particle ratios at midrapidity measured during the rhic run at @xmath3 gev are consistent with a system in chemical equilibrium , as described by a statistical model .",
    "the best - fit model parameters ( @xmath4 mev , @xmath5 mev ) differ by a factor 5 in baryon chemical potential @xmath1 from the fit at maximum sps energy @xcite , while the temperature changes very little ( sps : @xmath6 mev , @xmath7 mev ) .",
    "the small change in temperature , together with the good agreement with lattice qcd predictions of @xmath8 @xcite ( @xmath9 mev ) , suggests that the system is nearly borne into chemical equilibrium out of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "we also presented predictions for particle ratios at full rhic energy @xmath10 gev .    in this contribution , the model comparison for the rhic run at @xmath11 gev is extended to include additional ratio measurements which have been recently published or presented , including at this conference .",
    "the treatment and effect of feeddown correction to particle densities in the model is discussed .",
    "finally , the question of which ratios drive the model fit to the data is investigated .",
    "it is worth noting that the model parameter values ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) obtained here for the best fit to the data have not changed from the fit performed with the data available at the time of our publication .",
    "the primary tool for investigating chemical equilibration in heavy - ion collisions is the experimental measurement of particle production , and in particular ratios of particle species .",
    "all four rhic experiments have published or presented preliminary results on particle ratios .",
    "some experimental observations are @xcite :    * + /-",
    "ratios are approaching unity at midrapidity , indicating that quark coalescence and pair creation processes play a greater role in final - state particle yields .",
    "however , the midrapidity region is not yet baryon free at @xmath3 . *",
    "no large trends have been reported in ratios as a function of @xmath12 in the relevant @xmath12 range .",
    "* @xmath13 increases from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 at midrapidity , with a plateau width of 2 rapidity units .",
    "@xmath17 shows no rapidity dependence over the same region .",
    "since the submission of our paper @xcite , several additional measurements of ratios have been presented for the rhic 2000 data .",
    "the @xmath18 ratio was measured by the star collaboration @xcite to be @xmath19 .",
    "the phenix collaboration presented @xcite preliminary results for @xmath20 at this conference ( most central : @xmath21 ) .    also at this conference ,",
    "an updated preliminary value for @xmath22 was presented @xcite by the star collaboration ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the new value differs from the previous value @xcite by nearly a factor 2 due to improved statistics and a different treatment of the residual background .",
    "the statistical model employed in the present calculations was first described in @xcite . in the model ,",
    "particle densities are calculated as a grand canonical ensemble with the requirement that baryon , strangeness and isospin quantum numbers are conserved . all known particles and resonances up to 2 gev",
    "are included in the calculation , and particles decay according to their branching ratios .",
    "the best fit model parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) are determined by comparing model ratios to experimental values and finding the minimum @xmath24 .",
    "a @xmath25 indicates a good fit .",
    "when both statistical and systematic errors have been presented for experimental values , the errors are added in quadrature .    in this work ,",
    "the best fit parameters are determined to be @xmath4 mev , @xmath26 mev , with a @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters are the same as those in our paper @xcite , even though a new ratio is included and another significantly revised .",
    "the low @xmath28 can be attributed to the large systematic errors in the first measurements at rhic ; if the fit is performed with only statistical errors in the experimental values , @xmath28 increases to @xmath29 .",
    "the true @xmath30 lies between these two values .",
    "gev and statistical model calculations of particle ratios .",
    "the parameters of the model are @xmath31 mev , @xmath32 mev , and were determined by finding the parameter set with minimum @xmath24 .",
    "experimental data are taken from @xcite.,width=491 ]    figure 1 shows the model values for @xmath31 mev , @xmath32 mev , and the available data for the four experiments at rhic . note that many of the ratios are preliminary .",
    "model predictions for ratios involving @xmath33 in the denominator have increased slightly due to the corrected treatment of negative hadrons .",
    "now , as in the experimental values , only the primary negative hadrons ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) are included .",
    "in addition to the new and updated ratios mentioned in section [ sec : expt ] , experimental values are taken from @xcite ; see the table of compiled ratios in our paper @xcite for specific references .",
    "for the model calculations , a feeddown correction factor of 0.5 was applied for weak decays ; see section [ subsec : feeddown ] for a discussion of this factor .",
    "two observations can be made regarding figure 1 .",
    "first , the experimental value for @xmath37 now lies under the model value but within error bars .",
    "the previous underprediction of @xmath37 was a hot topic of discussion during this conference .",
    "second , the good agreement between model and experiment for @xmath38 is a success of the statistical model ; the model value can be treated as a prediction , since the model parameters here have not changed from our paper @xcite .    it should also be noted that preliminary values were shown @xcite at this conference by the star collaboration for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath39 measurement agrees well with the prediction from present model calculations ( @xmath39 : expt @xmath41 ; model @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , @xmath40 is underpredicted by a factor of 2 ( @xmath40 : expt @xmath43 ; model @xmath44 ) .",
    "if the experimental value for @xmath40 holds , the large disagreement with the statistical model would be an exciting result .",
    "however , we stress that the experimental results were presented as preliminary .",
    "as discussed in @xcite primary particle multiplicities are affected by contributions from weak decays . in order to compare model calculations of particle production with experimental data ,",
    "the  contamination \" from these weak decays needs to be accounted for .",
    "this is done in the model by multiplying the branching ratios for weakly decaying particles ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . ) by a correction factor .",
    "correction factors can be applied to particles individually in the model . however , in lieu of experimental values for these quantities , the default value used here and in our paper @xcite is 0.5 , which means _",
    "e.g. _ that half of the protons arising from @xmath45 decays are not removed from the proton multiplicity .",
    "points for three values of the feeddown contamination factor . surrounding each minimum are lines of constant @xmath24 .",
    "a contamination factor of 1 indicates that no feeddown contributions have been removed from the  fed \" particle multiplicities.,width=340 ]    figure 2 shows the location of minimum @xmath24 on the @xmath48 diagram for three values of the weak decay correction factor .",
    "the lines surrounding each minimum are contours of constant @xmath24 .",
    "the temperature decreases as the contamination from weak decays increases , while @xmath1 changes very little .",
    "the decrease in @xmath0 can be explained by the direct relation between temperature and particle production in the statistical model . as the multiplicity of primary particles ( @xmath49 , @xmath34 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , etc . )",
    "is increasingly contaminated , fewer _ true _ protons and pions need to be produced in order to agree with experimental values .",
    "of course , it is not realistic that all feeddown correction factors have the same value .",
    "the result of figure 2 merely demonstrates that weak decay contamination has a nontrivial effect on the extracted model parameters , particularly the temperature .      in this section",
    "we investigate the contribution of individual ratios to the good agreement between the statistical model and experimental data .",
    "the question arises as to which ratios are strongly dependent on the model parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "a ratio s sensitivity to these parameters comes from the mass and quantum numbers of the two particle species .",
    "this can be expressed in the boltzmann approximation as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor ( @xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 represent the baryon , strangeness and isospin quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath58 is the sum of the individual chemical potentials in the system .     for each ratio in figure 1 for two different values of the temperature .",
    "experimental values , compiled when multiple measurements are available , are represented by horizontal lines ; shaded areas indicate the experimental error.,width=453 ]    figure 3 shows the model calculation for each ratio included in figure 1 as a function of @xmath1 for two values of the temperature .",
    "the range of values is chosen to include the fitted parameter values at @xmath59 gev .",
    "the @xmath13 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ratios are strongly dependent on @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath13 , equation [ eq1 ] becomes @xmath62 the @xmath1 dependence of anti - baryon / baryon ratios is strong whenever @xmath63 is much less than @xmath0 ; therefore , the dependence weakens for strange and multistrange baryons due to the additional @xmath64 term in the chemical potential .    .",
    "experimental values , compiled when multiple measurements are available , are represented by horizontal lines ; shaded areas indicate the experimental error.,width=453 ]    conversely , figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of each ratio for two values of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath65 ratio exhibits the strongest dependence on the temperature .",
    "the strong @xmath0 dependence of @xmath65 is due to the large mass difference between the two species , which dominates for small values of @xmath63 .",
    "this is also the primary reason why multi - strange baryon / meson ratios are sensitive to the temperature , which we demonstrated in our paper @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 ratio s dependence on temperature results from the large contribution of the @xmath64 term in the chemical potential ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "equation [ eq1 ] is expressed as : @xmath68 note that strangeness conservation in the collision does not require that @xmath64 is zero .",
    "in this contribution , the work of our previous paper @xcite was extended to include new and updated ratios from the rhic experiments .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the statistical model calculations do not change when including the new data .",
    "the strong agreement between model and data for the available ratios supports the notion of a system in chemical equilibrium at freeze - out .    also , the uncorrected feeddown contamination from weak decays has a small but relevant effect on the values of the extracted parameters .",
    "the model temperature decreases as feeddown contamination of primary particles ( @xmath49 , @xmath69 , etc . )",
    "increases because less primaries need to be produced by the model to account for the experimental value .",
    "finally , @xmath1 was shown to be sensitive to anti - baryon / baryon ratios , primarily @xmath13 , and the @xmath70 ratio shows a strong temperature dependence .",
    "this work was done in collaboration with p. braun - munzinger , k. redlich , and j. stachel .",
    "the author thanks h. van hees and j. knoll for fruitful discussions regarding the statistical equations , and p. braun - munzinger for his careful reading of the manuscript ."
