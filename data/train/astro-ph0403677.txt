    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) have being gotten a lot of attention in the last 2 years ( heise et al . 2001 ; kippen et al .",
    "they are thought to be a lower energy extension of the known gamma - ray burst ( grb ) population , based on the fact that their spectral behaviors are similar to those of grbs ( kippen et al .",
    "2003 ; barraud et al .",
    "2003 ; sakamoto et al . 2004 ; lamb et al . 2003a , b , 2004 ) .",
    "the nature of a narrow cluster of the observed @xmath0 distribution of batse grbs remains poorly understood , which might be related to the jet structure of grbs .",
    "xrfs broaden the energy coverage of prompt grb emission and may bring more signatures of the jet structure of grbs ( lamb et al . 2003a , b , 2004 ) .",
    "the jet structure models are currently under heavy debate .",
    "any model should present a unified description for grbs and xrfs .",
    "two currently competing models are the structured jet model ( mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ; dai & gou 2001 ; rossi , lazzati , & rees 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ; granot & kumar 2003 ; kumar and granot 2003 ; panaitescu & kumar 2003 ; wei & jin 2003 ) and the uniform model ( e.g. , rhoads 1999 ; frail et al . 2001 ) .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that the current grb / xrf prompt emission / afterglow data can be described by a quasi  gaussian - type ( or similar structure ) structured jet with a typical opening angle of @xmath7 and with a standard jet energy of @xmath8 ergs . alternatively , based on the _ high energy transient explorer 2 _ ( _ hete-2 _ ) observations , lamb et al .",
    "( 2003a , b , 2004 ) propose that the uniform jet model can reasonably describe the unified scheme of grbs / xrfs .",
    "very recently , the two - component jet model was advocated by berger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on observations of grb 030329 , which has two different jet breaks in an early optical afterglow light curve ( 0.55 days , price et al . 2003 ) and in a late radio light curve ( 9.8 days ) .",
    "millimeter observations of this burst further support the two  component jet model ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) . numerical calculations of such a model were performed by huang et al .",
    "this model suggests that a grb / xrf jet has two components : a narrow , highly relativistic one , and a wide , mildly relativistic one .",
    "when the line of sight of an observer is within the narrow component , the observed burst is a typical grb , but when the line of sight is pointing to the wide  component , it is an xrf .",
    "a broad spectral energy distribution could constrain the jet structure models .",
    "a low peak energy of the @xmath1 spectrum ( @xmath9 kev ) and weak gamma  ray fluxes ( @xmath10 photons @xmath11 s@xmath12 , 50300 kev energy range ) distinguish xrfs from typical grbs ( kippen et al .",
    "2003 ; mochkovitch et al .",
    "it is well known that the observed @xmath0 distribution of batse grbs is narrowly clustered .",
    "does the observed @xmath0 distribution of xrfs exhibit a similar feature ? in this letter , we focus on this question .",
    "we analyze the observed @xmath0 distribution with a sample of 57 bursts observed by _",
    "hete-2_/ french gamma telescope ( fregate ) .",
    "combining the observed @xmath0 distribution of _",
    "grbs / xrfs with that of batse grbs , we find that the observed @xmath0 distribution of grbs / xrfs is a bimodal one peaking at @xmath2 kev and @xmath3 kev .",
    "with respect to this result , we suggest that the two  component jet model is a reasonable candidate model for grb / xrf jets .",
    "a simulation analysis confirms this suggestion .",
    "we make a search for _ hete-2 _ grbs / xrfs reported in literature and on the _ hete-2 _ web site . all the bursts with @xmath0 or fluences ( @xmath13 ) in the available energy bands 730 kev and 30400 kev",
    "are included in our sample .",
    "we obtain a sample that includes 57 bursts . among them , 49 of the bursts are taken from barraud et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , atteia ( 2003 ) , sakamoto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , lamb et al .",
    "( 2003a , b , 2004 ) , and the _ hete2 _ web site .",
    "their @xmath0 values are derived from spectral fittings .",
    "please note that the @xmath0 values of grb 010923 , 011216 , and 021004 presented in barraud et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are incorrect , and they are taken from lamb et al .",
    "( 2003a , b , 2004 ) . for the other eight bursts , grb 030824 , 030823 , 030725 , 030913 , 030528 , 030519 , 030418 , and 030416 , only fluences in the energy bands of 730 kev and 30400 kev are available . for these bursts ,",
    "we estimate their @xmath0 by their spectral hardness ratios , which are defined as @xmath14 . since the spectra of grbs / xrfs",
    "can be well fitted by the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) with similar spectral indices ( kippen et al . 2003",
    "; barraud et al .",
    "2003 ) , their @xmath0 should be proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "a best fit to the data presented in barraud et al .",
    "( 2003 ) derives @xmath16 with a linear coefficient of 0.93 and a chance probability @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , without considering grb 010923 , 011216 , or 021004 ) .",
    "we thus estimate the @xmath0 values of the above eight bursts by using this relation .",
    "we show the @xmath0 distribution in a range of @xmath19 with a step of 0.23 for these bursts in figure 1a .",
    "it is found that the distribution has three peaks at 30 , 160 , and 450 kev .",
    "we note that the peaks of 160 and 450 kev seem to be embedded in one peak , and the gap at @xmath20 kev is likely to be fake . the spectral analysis for a bright batse grb sample by preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has shown that the @xmath0 values are clustered at 100 - 1000 kev with a peak of @xmath21 kev ( the dotted line in panel ( a ) of figure 1 ) .",
    "we thus suspect that the peaks of 160 kev and 450 kev are likely to be embedded in one peak which is similar to that of batse grb sample .",
    "if the case really shows one peak , the @xmath0 distributions observed by _ hete2 _ and by batse in the range of @xmath22 kev should be consistent .",
    "we examine this hypothesis by a kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test ( press et al .",
    "1997 , p.617 ) .",
    "the result of the k - s test is described by a statistic of @xmath23 : a small value of @xmath23 indicates a significant difference between two distributions ( @xmath24 indicates that two distributions are identical , and @xmath25 suggests that the consistency of two distributions should be rejected ; e.g. , bloom 2003 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath26 , indicating that the consistency of the two distributions is acceptable . however , their difference is still quite significant .",
    "this difference might be due to a strong sample selection effect in the batse grb sample presented by preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who considered only those bursts with total fluence @xmath27 ergs @xmath11 or peak fluxes higher than 10 photons cm @xmath28 s@xmath12 in a 1.024 s timescale . to avoid such a sample selection effect",
    ", we further compare the distributions of the hardness ratios of _",
    "hete-2 _ bursts and batse bursts in figure 1b .",
    "in figure 1b , the batse grb sample includes all of the long - duration bursts without any sample selection effect ( 1213 events , from batse current catalog ) .",
    "a k  s test to the two distributions in the range of @xmath29 derives @xmath30 , strongly suggesting a consistency between the two distributions in that range .",
    "thus , we suggest that the @xmath0 distribution in 1001000 kev should form one sole peak , centering at @xmath3 kev .",
    "the peak of @xmath31 kev or @xmath32 seems to be a unique one .",
    "a sharp cutoff occurs on its left side .",
    "this might be caused by the limit of _",
    "hete-2_. hence ,",
    "we suggest that the @xmath0 distribution should exhibit another peak of an energy @xmath2 kev .    based on the above analysis",
    ", we propose that the @xmath0 distribution of grbs / xrfs is a bimodal one , peaking at an energy @xmath2 kev and @xmath3 kev .",
    "the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath0 for grbs / xrfs might strongly constrain the jet structure models of grbs / xrfs .    from @xmath33^{2}$ ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( amati et al . 2002 ; lloyd - ronning & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ; atteia 2003 ; sakamoto et al . 2004 ; lamb et al . 2003a , b , 2004 ; liang , dai & wu 2004 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the jet opening angle ( frail et al . 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; piran et al . 2001 ; bloom et al . 2003",
    "; berger , kulkarni , & frail 2003 ) , we can derive @xmath38 ^ 2}\\right \\}.\\ ] ]    in the uniform jet model , one expects that both xrfs and grbs should obey eq .",
    ". however , this relation can not simply extend to any bursts with @xmath39 kev , because of the limit of @xmath40 .",
    "the redshifts of the two extremely soft xrfs , 020903 and 030723 , are 0.251 ( soderberg et al . 2003 ) and less than 2.1 ( fynbo et al . 2004 ) , respectively ; but their @xmath0 values are less than @xmath41 kev .",
    "the two xrfs violate this relationship .",
    "in addition , the uniform jet model may not accommodate the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "a quasi - universal gaussian - type jet model may also present a unified picture for grbs / xrfs .",
    "lloyd - ronning , dai , & zhang ( 2003 ) found that this model can reproduce the relation of the equivalent  isotropic energy to the viewing angle , and zhang et al .",
    "( 2004a ) further showed that the current grb / xrf prompt emission / afterglow data can be described by this model ( or similarly structured jet ) with a typical opening angle of @xmath42 and with a standard jet energy of @xmath8 ergs .",
    "however , the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath0 is difficult to be explained by this model .    according to the equivalent - isotropic energy@xmath0 relationship discovered recently by amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the bimodal @xmath0 distribution seems to imply a two - component structure of grb / xrf jets . to investigate whether or not this model can reproduce the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath0",
    ", we make a simple simulation analysis .",
    "we describe the energy per solid angle of the two  component model by two gaussian jets ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the viewing angle measured from the jet axis , @xmath45 is the maximum value of energy per solid angle , @xmath46 is the ratio of @xmath47 in the wide component to narrow component , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are characteristic angular widthes of the narrow and wide components , respectively . since @xmath50",
    ", the observed @xmath0 should be given by    @xmath51    similar to lloyd - ronning , dai , & zhang ( 2003 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we assume that the two components are quasi - universal , where ",
    "quasi \" means that the parameters of this model have a dispersion but are not invariable .",
    "we perform a simple monte carlo simulation analysis with the distributions of these parameters .",
    "the probability of observing a grb / xrf with @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "one can expect this probability to be random .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath53 is uniformly distributed in the range of 01 .",
    "the @xmath54 distribution should be mainly determined by a bright grb sample . since the observed @xmath0 for bright batse grbs",
    "are narrowly clustered at @xmath55 kev and since the measured redshift distribution is around @xmath56 , we take the differential distribution of @xmath57 as that of @xmath0 for the bright grbs , but centered at @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59 kev ) , which is given by @xmath60/0.45 ^ 2\\}$ ] , where the coefficient 0.018 is a normalized constant .",
    "we assume that the redshift distribution is the same as the one of bloom ( 2003 ) , who assumed that the burst rate as a function of redshift is proportional to the star formation rate , and who presented the observed redshift distribution incorporating observational biases ( model sf1 from porciani & madau 2001 is used in this work ) .",
    "we also restrict @xmath61 because the largest @xmath62 is 4.5 in our present grb sample . for @xmath63 and @xmath46 , we can not reasonably model their distributions with the present data , and thus we simply estimate their values as follows . since the mean value of the jet opening angles of 16 grbs presented in bloom et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is @xmath64 rad ( without considering the eight grbs whose limits of jet opening angles are presented ) , we take @xmath65 rad . based on the results shown in figure 1 , we have @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 is the most poorly understood among these parameters .",

    ", we first derive the accumulative probability distributions of these parameters @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , then generate a random number @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , and finally obtain the value of @xmath71 from the inverse function of @xmath78 ; i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "the values of @xmath63 and @xmath46 are fixed at 0.15 rad and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is an adjustable variable with a limit of @xmath68 .",
    "we find that @xmath69 rad can roughly reproduce the @xmath0 distribution shown in figure 1 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 for each simulated grb / xrf with the above parameters using eq .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we find that the distribution is bimodal with peaks of @xmath6 and @xmath81 kev and with a valley at @xmath82 kev .",
    "these results show that the two - gaussian jet model can roughly reproduce the bimodal distribution of the observed @xmath0 .    in our simulation",
    ", we do not consider any instrument threshold setting .",
    "the energy bandpass of _",
    "hete2_/fregate is 7400 kev . from figure 1",

    "this @xmath0 value might reflect the effective threshold of _",

    "the peak of @xmath6 kev in the simulated @xmath0 distribution is key evidence for the two component jet model .",
    "it is near the lowest end of the energy bandpass of _ hete-2_/fregate .",
    "fortunately , _ hete-2 _ provides a weak clue to this peak . a more sensitive instrument than _",
    "hete2 _ with an energy bandpass @xmath86 kev is required to further confirm this peak . _",
    "swift _ , which covers an energy band of 0.2150 kev ( we mark this region in figure 2 with diagonal lines ) is expected to provide a key test for it .",
    "simulations of the propagation and eruption of relativistic jets in massive wolf - rayet stars by zhang , woosley , & heger ( 2004b ) show that an erupting jet has a highly relativistic , strongly collimated core , and a moderately relativistic , less energetic cocoon .",
    "the cocoon expands and becomes visible at larger angles .",
    "the energy ratio of the cocoon to the core in their simulation is about one order . from our simulation results",
    ", we find that it is @xmath87 , being roughly consistent with their results .",
    "their simulations seem to support the two - component jet model .",
    "we have noted that the ability of the cocoon to cause an xrf depends sensitively on its lorentz factor , which is determined by the degree of mixing between the jet and envelope material .",
    "matzner ( 2003 ) argued that this mixing might be difficult to resolve in numerical simulations .",
    "a two - component jet was suggested to be universal for grb / xrf phenomena in this letter , based on the multi - wavelength observations of grb 0303029 ( berger et al .",
    "2003 ; sheth et al . 2003 ) and the bimodal distribution of @xmath88 .",
    "it should be pointed out that other jet models such as uniform jets and single - component - universal jets were proposed to explain numerous observations on the afterglows and some correlations ( e.g. , lamb et al .",
    "2003b ; lloyd - ronning et al . 2004 ; lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) .",
