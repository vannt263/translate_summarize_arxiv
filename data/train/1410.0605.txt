    "delmotte @xcite proved that the transition density of the simple random walk on a graph satisfies gaussian bounds and the parabolic harnack inequality holds if all the balls have regular volume growth and satisfy a poincar inequality .",
    "barlow @xcite relaxed these conditions by imposing them only on all _ large enough _ balls , and showed that they imply large time gaussian bounds and the elliptic harnack inequality for large enough balls .",
    "later , barlow and hambly @xcite proved that the parabolic harnack inequality also follows from barlow s conditions .",
    "barlow @xcite verified these conditions for the supercritical cluster of bernoulli percolation on @xmath0 , which lead to the almost sure gaussian heat kernel bounds and parabolic harnack inequality . by using stationarity and heat kernel bounds ,",
    "the quenched invariance principle was proved in @xcite , which lead to many further results about supercritical bernoulli percolation , including the local central limit theorem @xcite and the fact that the dimension of harmonic functions of at most linear growth is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the independence property of bernoulli percolation was essential in verifying barlow s conditions , and up to now it has been the only example of percolation model for which the conditions were verified . on the other hand ,",
    "once the conditions are verified , the derivation of all the further results uses rather robust methods and allows for extension to other stationary percolation models .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop an approach to verifying barlow s conditions for infinite clusters of percolation models , which on the one hand , applies to supercritical bernoulli percolation , but on the other , does not rely on independence and extends beyond models which are in any stochastic relation with bernoulli percolation . motivating examples for us are random interlacements , vacant set of random interlacements , and the level sets of the gaussian free field @xcite . in all these models , the spatial correlations decay only polynomially with distance , and classical peierls - type arguments do not apply . a unified framework to study percolation models with strong correlations",

    "we prove that barlow s conditions are satisfied by infinite percolation clusters in the general setting of @xcite .",
