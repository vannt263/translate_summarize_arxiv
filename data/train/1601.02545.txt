    "in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the equivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic limit provides a useful tool for analyzing systems that are subject to sharp constraints .",

    "if we wish to construct an ensemble that describes an equilibrium system conditioned on a specific value of an extensive observable , then we can use boltzmann - like weights to bias the distribution toward that value ; in the thermodynamic limit the conditioned and biased distributions become equivalent .",

    "the formal analogy with the equilibrium case suggests that such biased ensembles may be equivalent , in the appropriate limit , to nonequilibrium ensembles conditioned on specified values of the path observable @xmath6 .",
    "this problem has been addressed explicitly by jack and sollich @xcite for discrete - state systems , and by chetrite and touchette @xcite for a broad class of stochastic models including diffusive processes .",
    "using the theory of large deviations , these authors have established the equivalence between conditioned ( `` microcanonical '' ) and biased ( `` canonical '' ) path space distributions , in the long - time limit , given certain conditions related to the fluctuations of the observable appearing in the exponential weight .",
