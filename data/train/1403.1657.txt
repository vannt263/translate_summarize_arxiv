    "ever since the establishment of classical control theory by several famous scientists , namely nyquist , bode , harris , evans , wienner , nichols et al in the beginning of 20th century , most of the existing works have studied the mono - stability and mono - periodicity of the dynamical system .",
    "however , many physical and biological systems are known in which there are a multitude of coexisting attractors @xcite .",
    "examples include systems from laser physics , chemistry , semiconductor physics , neuroscience , and population dynamics , see reference @xcite and the references therein .",
    "due to its significant applications on neural networks ( nns ) with respect to associate memory pattern , recognition and decision making , the topics on multistability and multiperiodicity of nns began to gain a lot of attention and have been investigated intensively in the past decade @xcite . moreover , in a sense , multistability is a necessary property in nns in order to enable certain applications where mono - stability networks could be computationally restrictive @xcite .    due to the cornucopia of opportunities and rich flexibility provided by the chaotic system ,",
    "chaos , as a very special dynamical behavior in nonlinear system , has been thoroughly investigated in the recent years@xcite .",
    "topics include stabilization , anti - control and synchronization of chaotic system .",
    "although their are a lot of research about chaos , multichaos , which means that the chaotic solution of a system lies in different disjoint invariant sets with respect to different initial values has never been talked and studied .",
    "multistability , multiperiodicity as well as multichaos are different properties of the solutions in disjoint invariant sets , the research on multichaos in systems with disjoint invariant sets has the same significance as the research of chaos in mono - system .",
    "although there should be multichaos solution of a system after the multistability and multiperiodicity solution have been found , nobody has given an exact example to demonstrate the multichaos phenomenon thus far .",
    "in this paper , by construction of a multiple logistic map , we can observe the multichaos phenomenon which help us understand the more complicated case in dynamical systems .",
    "_ definition 1 : _ let @xmath1 be a compact subset of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 is said to be a positive invariant set of the @xmath3 dimensional continuous system @xmath4 or the discrete map @xmath5 if their solution trajectories will not get out once entered @xmath1 .",
    "_ definition 2 : _ if there exist two or more disjoint positive invariant sets for the @xmath3 dimensional continuous system @xmath4 or the discrete map @xmath5 in @xmath2 , and the solution in every disjoint set is chaotic , then this phenomenon is called multichaos and the above systems are called multichaotic system .    _ _ remark 1:__the multichaotic system is different from multi - wing chaotic system discussed by simin yu et al @xcite , xinzhi liu et al @xcite , where the multi - wing chaotic system contains only one positive invariant set .      with the advent of fast computers , the numerical investigations of chaos have increased considerably over the last three decades and by now , a lot is known about chaotic systems .",
    "one of the simplest and most transparent systems exhibiting order to chaos transition is the logistic map . in this subsection",
    ", we give a unified framework which is constructed by multiple logistic map to demonstrate multistability , multiperiodicity and multichaos according to the different value of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the logistic map is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 a number between zero and one , and represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population at year @xmath3 , and hence @xmath8 represents the initial ratio of population to maximum population ( at year 0 ) , @xmath0 is a positive number , and represents a combined rate for reproduction and starvation . here in this paper , we assume @xmath0 is a number between zero and four . as we all know ,",
    "the eq.([1 ] ) will demonstrate stable fixed points , period-2 , period-4 , period-8 , @xmath9 and chaos dynamics according to different @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , when @xmath0 is between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , there exists a fixed points ; when @xmath0 is between 3 and approximately 3.57 , there are periodic oscillations ; when @xmath0 is larger than approximately 3.57 , the eq.([1 ] ) will undergo chaotic behavior .",
    "next , a multiple logistic map @xmath12 is redefined by connecting @xmath13 and extending its domain infinitely instead of only in the invariant set @xmath14 .",
    "below is the definition of @xmath12 : let @xmath15 be the set of all integers , for any @xmath16 , when @xmath17 @xmath18 when @xmath19 $ ] , let @xmath20 , the figure of @xmath12 is given in fig.[functionf ] .     as @xmath21 varies from -3 to 3,width=340,height=226 ]    for any @xmath22 ,",
    "the solution of @xmath23 lies within @xmath24 beginning the the initial @xmath8 . according to",
    "_ definition 1 _ , it is evident that for any @xmath16 , the set @xmath24 is positive invariant set of @xmath12 .",
    "the proof is trivial , thus it is omitted here .",
    "it is also very evident that there are infinite positive invariant sets because there are infinite integers .",

    "the initial values are the -0.4 , 0.5 , 1.4 , 2.4 .",
    "fig.[ms ] demonstrates multistability when @xmath28 , with each solution orbit residing on a fixed point which lies in the corresponding positive invariant sets .",
    "fig.[mp2 ] and fig.[mp4 ] shows multiple period-2 and period-4 solution with @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "fig.[mc ] presents multichaos phenomenon when @xmath20 .",
    "in the last section , we give an example to show the existence of multichaos in an one - dimensional map . in this section , a continuous three - dimensional system that exhibits multichaotic behavior",
    "is constructed based on lorenz system . by defining a sawtooth function ,",
    "the phase space is divided into infinite squares . in each square",
    ", there is a positive invariance set in which lorenz attractors are defined .",
    "the well known lorenz system @xcite is given below : @xmath31 when @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the system [ 31 ] exhibits chaotic behavior . according to ref.@xcite , lorenz system has only one positive invariance set .",
    "let @xmath35 be the positive invariance set , then the set @xmath35 is given below by calculating the result derived by ref.@xcite , which is @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 . apparently , @xmath35 is the subset of @xmath38 .",
    "when the initial value @xmath39 belongs to @xmath35 , the trajectory of [ 31 ] will not get out according to the definition of positive invariant set . in order to generate lorenz - like multichaotic attractors , a sawtooth function and a novel multichaotic lorenz system",
    "is defined .",
    "the sawtooth function @xmath40 is defined as below : @xmath41 when @xmath42 , @xmath40 is depicted in fig.[gx ] .     as @xmath21 varies from -400 to 400,width=340,height=226 ]    for simplicity , denote @xmath43 , also , @xmath44 and @xmath15 are defined likewise .",
    "the multichaotic system based on lorenz system is given as below : @xmath45 when the initial value lies in the compact set @xmath35 , the solution of [ 33 ] will be exactly like [ 31 ] and thus exhibiting a typical double wing strange attractor .",
    "denote @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath47 is composed of infinite disjoint compact subsets . for an initial point",
    "@xmath48 starting from any of the disjoint sets of @xmath47 , there is a transformation satisfying @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50,@xmath51,@xmath52 , then the equation [ 33 ] with the initial point lying in one of the subsets of @xmath47 will be transformed into the following equation : @xmath53 which is the same with the case of eq.[31 ] with a initial point starting from @xmath35 .",
    "it is very easy to prove that any orbit starting from a initial point lying in @xmath47 will not get out of a positive invariant set determined by the specific value of @xmath54 .",
    "a simulation result is given to verify the coexistence of multichaotic attractors in fig.[mlc ] .",
    "there are eight chaotic attractors in fig.[mlc ] , with each starting from different positive invariant subsets of @xmath47 .",
    "in this paper , we give the definition of multichaos which is never defined before . by constructing a multiple logistic map ,",
    "we show that the map can exhibit multistability , multiperiodicity and multichaos according to different @xmath0 .",
    "then the continuous multiple lorenz chaotic attractors are constructed using a sawtooth function . by calculating the positive invariant sets , we show that initial points starting in the positive invariant sets will not get out and will exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior in each disjoint positive invariant set .",
