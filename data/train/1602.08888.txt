    "neutron star is a venerable candidate to discuss the physics at high density .",
    "we can not create such a high density in terrestrial laboratory , so neutron star is and the only object , which can provides many information on high density nature of the matter@xcite .",
    "but it is not an easy task to deal with the neutron star for it s complex nature , as all the four fundamental forces ( strong , weak , gravitational and electromagnetic ) are active .",
    "high gravitational field makes mandatory to use general theory of relativity for the study of neutron star structure .",
    "equations of states ( eos ) are the sole ingredient that must be supplied to the equation of stellar structure , tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation , whose out - come is the mass - radius profile of the dense neutron star . in this case",
    ", the nuclear eos plays an intimate role in deciding the mass - radius of a neutron star .",
    "its indispensable important attracts the attention of physicists to have an anatomy of the interactions lagrangian .",
    "as the name suggests , neutron star is not completely made up neutrons , a small fraction of protons and electrons are also present , which is the consequence of the @xmath2equilibrium and charge neutrality condition@xcite .",
    "also , the presence of exotic degrees of freedom like hyperons and kaons can not be ignored in such a high dense matter .",
    "it is one among the most asymmetric and dense nuclear system in nature .    from last three decades @xcite , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) generalized by walecka @xcite and later on developed by boguta and",
    "bodmer @xcite is one amongst the most reliable theory to deal with infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the original rmf formalism starts with an effective lagrangian , whose degrees of freedom are nucleons , @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6mesons . to reproduce proper experimental observable ,",
    "it is extended to the self - interaction of @xmath7meson .",
    "recently , all other self- and crossed interactions including the baryon octet are also introduced keeping in view the extra - ordinary condition of the system , such as highly asymmetric system or extremely high density medium @xcite . since the rmf formalism is an effective nucleons - mesons model , the coupling constants for both nucleon - meson and hyperon - meson are fitted to reproduce the properties of selected nuclei and infinite nuclear matter properties @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is improper to use the parameters obtained from the free nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "the parameters , with proper relativistic kinematics and with the mesons and their properties already known or fixed from the properties of a small number of finite nuclei , the method gives excellent results not only for spherical nuclei , but also of well - known deformed cases . the same force parametrization can be used both for @xmath2stable and @xmath2unstable nuclei through - out the periodic table @xcite .",
    "the importance of the self- and crossed- interactions are significant for some specific properties of nuclei / nuclear - matter in certain conditions .",
    "for example , self - interaction of @xmath8-meson takes care of the reduction of nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath9 from an unacceptable high value of @xmath10 mev to a reasonable number of @xmath11 mev @xcite , while the self - interaction of vector meson @xmath12 soften the equation of state@xcite .",
    "thus , it is imperative to include all the mesons and their possible interactions with nucleons , self- and crossed terms in the effective lagrangian density .",
    "however , it is not necessary to do so , because of the symmetry reason and their heavy masses @xcite .",
    "for example , to keep the spin - isospin and parity symmetry in the ground state , the contribution of @xmath6meson is ignored @xcite and also the effect of heaver mesons are neglected for their negligible contribution .",
    "taking into this argument , in many versions of the rmf formalisms , the inclusion of isovector - scalar ( @xmath0 ) meson is neglected due to its small contribution .",
    "but recently it is seen @xcite that the endowment of the @xmath0-meson goes on increasing with density and asymmetry of nuclear system .",
    "thus , it will be impossible for us to justify the abandon of @xmath1meson both conceptually and practically , while considering the highly asymmetry and dense nuclear system , like neutron star and relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "recent observation of neutron star like psr j1614 - 2230 with mass of ( 1.97@xmath130.04)@xmath14 @xcite and the psr j0348 + 0432 with mass of ( 2.01@xmath130.04)@xmath14 @xcite re - open the challenge in the dense matter physics .",
    "the heavy mass of psr j0348 + 0432 ( m=2.01@xmath130.04@xmath14 ) forces the nuclear theorists to re - think the composition and interaction inside the neutron star .",
    "therefore , it is important to establish the effects of the @xmath0-meson and all possible interactions of other mesons for such compact and asymmetry system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ form ] , we have outlined a brief theoretical formalism . here , the necessary steps of the rmf model and the inclusion of @xmath1meson is explained .",
    "the results and discussions are devoted in sec .",
    "[ resu ] . here ,",
    "we have attempted to explain the effects of @xmath0-meson on the nuclear matter system like hyperon and proton - neutron stars .",
    "this analysis is done for both static and rotating neutron and neutron - hyperon stars . in this calculations ,",
    "the e - rmf lagrangian ( g2 parameter set ) is used to take care of all possible self- and crossed interactions @xcite . on top of the g2 lagrangian ,",
    "the @xmath1meson interaction is added to take care of the isovector channel .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in section  [ conc ] .",
    "from last one decade a lot of work have been done to emphasize the role of @xmath1meson on both finite and infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the contribution of @xmath0-meson to the symmetry energy is negative @xcite . to fix the symmetry energy around the empirical value ( @xmath1530 mev )",
    "we need a large coupling constant of the @xmath5meson @xmath16 value in the absence of the @xmath17 .",
    "the proton and neutron effective masses split due to inclusion of @xmath0-meson and consequently it affects the transport properties of neutron star@xcite .",
    "the addition of @xmath0-meson not only modify the property of infinite nuclear matter , but also enhances the spin - orbit splitting in the finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "a lot of mystery are present in the effects of @xmath0-meson till date .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to study such information .",
    "it is to be noted that both the @xmath5 and @xmath1mesons correspond to the isospin asymmetry , and a careful precaution is essential while fixing the @xmath0-meson coupling in the interaction .",
    "the effective field theory and naturalness of the parameter are described in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is consistent with underlying symmetries of the qcd .",
    "the g2 parameter is motivated by e - rmf theory .",
    "the terms of the lagrangian are taken into account up to @xmath18 order in meson - baryon coupling . for the study of isovector channel",
    ", we have introduced the isovector - scalar @xmath0-meson .",
    "the baryon - meson interaction is given by @xcite :    @xmath19    the co - variant derivative @xmath20 is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are field tensors and defined as follow @xmath24 @xmath25 here , @xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 are the sigma , omega , rho and delta meson fields , respectively and in real calculation , we ignore the non - abelian term from the @xmath5field . all symbols are carrying their own usual meaning  @xcite .    the lagrangian equation for different mesons are given by @xcite :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are scalar densities for the proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the total scalar density is expressed as the sum of the proton and neutron densities @xmath34 , which is given by @xmath35 and the vector ( baryon ) density @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is the effective energy , @xmath38 is the fermi momentum of the baryons . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the proton and neutron effective masses written as + @xmath41 which is solved self - consistently .",
    "@xmath42 is the third component of isospin projection and @xmath43 stands for baryon octet .",
    "the energy and pressure density depends on the effective mass @xmath44 of the system , which first needed to solve these self - consistent equations and obtained the fields for mesons . using the einstein s energy - momentum tensor , the total energy and pressure density",
    "are given as @xcite :    @xmath45    and    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are lepton s pressure and energy density , respectively .",
    "before going to the discussions of our results , we give a brief description of the parameter fitting procedure for g@xmath49 and g@xmath50 in subsection  [ resua ] .",
    "then the results on hyperon star along with the neutron star structures both for static and rotating cases under @xmath2equilibrium condition are discussed in the subsequent subsections  [ resub ] ,  [ resuc ] ,  [ resud ] ,  [ resue ] and  [ resuf ] .",
    "it is important to fix the @xmath17 value to see the effects of the @xmath0-meson .",
    "the isovector channels in rmf theory come to exist through both the @xmath26 and @xmath0 mesons couplings .",
    "while considering the effects of the @xmath0-meson , we have to take the @xmath51-meson into account .",
    "since both the isovector channels are related to isospin , one can not optimize the @xmath17 coupling independently . here",
    ", we have followed a more reliable procedure by fixing the symmetry energy @xmath52 by adjusting simultaneously different values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 value@xcite . as it is mentioned earlier , we have added @xmath17 on top of the g2 parameter set .",
    "thus , the symmetry energy of g2 parameter is @xmath53 mev is kept constant at the time of re - shuffling @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the g2 parameters and the @xmath54 and @xmath54 combinations are displayed in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the nuclear matter properties are also listed in the table .",

    "[ fig1 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is clear that as the @xmath17 increases the @xmath16 value also increases , almost linearly , to fix the symmetry energy unchanged .",
    "this implies that @xmath26 and @xmath0-mesons have opposite effect on @xmath52 contribution , i.e. , the @xmath0-meson has negative contribution of the symmetry energy contrary to the positive contribution of @xmath26-meson .",
    "the fields of the meson play a crucial role to construct the nuclear potential , which is the deciding factor for all type of calculations in the relativistic mean field model . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have plotted various meson fields included in the present calculations , such as @xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 with @xmath54 on top of g2 parameter set @xmath56 .     and nl3 parameter sets .",
    "the @xmath7 ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath58 ) fields are compared with the results of dbhf theory @xcite . ]",
    "it is obvious that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are opposite to each other , which is also reflected in the figure .",
    "this means , the positive value of @xmath59 gives a strong repulsion , which is compensated by the strongly attractive potential of the @xmath7meson field @xmath57 .",
    "the nature of the curves for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are almost similar except the sign .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath57 and @xmath58 looks almost equal .",
    "however , in real ( it is not clearly visible in the curve , because of the scale ) , the value of @xmath57 is slightly larger than @xmath58 , which keeps the overall nuclear potential strongly attractive .",
    "the attractive @xmath57 and repulsive @xmath58 potentials combinely give the saturation properties of the nuclear force .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the contributions of self - interaction terms are taken care both in @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are the key quantities to solve the coester band problem @xcite and the explanation of quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) formation within the relativistic mean field formalism @xcite .",
    "the self - interaction of the @xmath7meson gives a repulsive force at long range part of the nuclear potential , which is equivalent to the 3-body interaction and responsible for the saturation properties of nuclear force .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are compared with the results obtained from dbhf theory with bonn - a potential@xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] clearly shows that in the low density region ( density @xmath26 @xmath60 ) both rmf and dbhf theories well matched .",
    "but as it increases beyond density @xmath26 @xmath60 both the calculations deviate from each other",
    ". the possible reason may be the fitting of parameters in bonn - a potential is up to @xmath61 times of saturation density @xmath62 , beyond that the dbhf data are simple extrapolation of the dbhf theory .",
    "the contribution of both @xmath5 and @xmath1 mesons correspond to the isovector channel .",
    "the @xmath1meson gives different effective masses for proton and neutron , because of their opposite iso - spin of the third component .",

    "we noticed that although their contributions are small , but non - negligible .",
    "these non - zero values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the nuclear potential has a larger consequence , mostly in compact dense object like neutron or hyperon stars , which will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "the energy density and pressure density are known as equations of states ( eos ) .",
    "these quantities are the key ingredients to describe the structure of neutron / hyperon stars . to see the sensitivity of the eos , we have plotted energy per particle ( @xmath65 ) as a function of density for pure neutron matter in fig  [ fig3 ] and pressure density as a function of energy density in fig  [ fig4 ] .",
    "each curve corresponds to a particular combination of @xmath17 and @xmath16 , which reproduce the symmetry energy @xmath53 mev without destabilizing other parameters of g2 set .",
    "the green line represents for @xmath66 , i.e. , with pure g2 parameter set . both the binding energy per particle as well as the pressure density increase with the value of @xmath17 .",
    "this process continue till the value of @xmath17 reaches , at which @xmath65 equals the nuclear matter binding energy per particle .",
    "an unphysical situation arises beyond this value of @xmath17 , because the binding energy of the neutron matter will be greater than @xmath65 for symmetric nuclear matter .     and",

    "@xmath17 . ]    in the case of g2+@xmath0 parametrization , this limiting value of @xmath54 reaches at @xmath17= 0.7 , after which we do not get a convergence solution in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath67-equilibrium and charge neutrality are two important conditions to justify the structural composition of the neutron / hyperon stars .",
    "both these conditions force the stars to have @xmath1590@xmath68 of neutron and @xmath1510@xmath68 proton . with the inclusion of baryons , the @xmath2equilibrium conditions between chemical potentials for different particles : @xmath69 and the charge neutrality condition is satisfy by @xmath70    to calculate the mass and radius profile of the static ( non - rotating ) , but spherical neutron star , we solve the general relativity tolmann - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov)@xcite equations which are written as : @xmath71[m(r)+\\frac{4\\pi r^3 p(r)}{c^2}]}{r^2(1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^2 r})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath72 with g as the gravitational constant , @xmath73@xmath74 as the energy density , @xmath75 as the pressure density and @xmath76 as the gravitational mass inside radius @xmath77 .",
    "we have used c=1 . for a given eos , these equations can be integrated from the origin as an initial value problem for a given choice of the central density @xmath73@xmath78(@xmath77 ) .",
    "the value of r ( = r ) at which the pressure vanishes defines the surface of the star . in order to understand the effect of @xmath1meson coupling on neutron star structure",
    ", we must also look , what happens to massive objects as they rotate and how this affects the space - time around them .        for this",
    ", we use the code written by stergioulas@xcite based on komastu , eriguchi , and hachisu ( keh ) method ( fast rotation)@xcite to construct mass - radius of the uniform rotating star .",
    "one should note that the maximum mass of static star is less than the rotating stars . because , when the massive objects rotate they flatten at their poles .",
    "the forces of rotation , namely the effective centrifugal force , pulls the mass farthest from the center further out , creating the equatorial bulge .",
    "this pull away from the center will , in part , counteract gravity , allowing the star to be able to support more mass than its non - rotating star .    we know that the core of neutron stars contain hyperons a very high density ( @xmath157 - 8 @xmath79 ) matter . as it is mentioned before , with the presence of baryons , the eos becomes softer and stellar properties will be changed .",
    "the maximum mass of hyperon star decreases about 10 - 20@xmath68 depending on the choice of the meson - hyperon coupling constants .",
    "the hyperon couplings are expressed as the ratio between the meson - hyperon and meson - nucleon couplings as : @xmath80 in the present calculations , we have taken @xmath81 = 0.6104 and @xmath82 = 0.6666@xcite .",
    "one can find similar calculations for stellar mass in refs .",
    "now we present the star properties like mass and radius in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plotted the mass - radius profile for the proton - neutron star as well as for the hyperon star using a wide variation of parameter sets starting from the old parameter like nl - sh@xcite to the new set of fsu2 @xcite .",
    "the mass - radius profile varies to a great extend over the choice of the parameter .",
    "for example , in fsu parameter set @xcite , the maximum possible mass of the proton - neutron star is @xmath15 1.75 @xmath14 , while the maximum possible mass for the nl3 set @xcite is @xmath15 2.8 @xmath14 .",
    "these results are shown in the left panel of the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , while right panel show same things for the hyperon star .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to understand the effects of @xmath0-meson on neutron stars both with and without hyperons .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] represent the mass - radius profiles for non - rotating stars taking into account the presence of with and without hyperons .",
    "these profiles are shown for various combinations of @xmath83 and @xmath54 , which we have obtained by fitting the symmetry energy @xmath52 of pure nuclear matter .     and",
    "@xmath83 in g2+@xmath0 .",
    "( a ) the left panel is for proton - neutron star and ( b ) the right panel is for the hyperon star . ]    , but for rotating stars . ]",
    "analyzing the graphs , we notice a slight change in the maximum mass with g@xmath50 value .",
    "that means , the mass of the star goes on decreasing with an increase value of the @xmath0-meson coupling .",
    "a further inspection of the results reveals that , although the @xmath0-meson coupling has a nominal effects on the maximum mass of the stars , we get an asymptotic increase in the radius . this asymptotic nature of the curves is more prominent in presence of hyperons inside the stars .",
    "similar phenomena are also observed in case of rotating stars .",
    "finally , we want to see the effects of @xmath1meson coupling on the particle production for the whole baryonic family at various densities in nuclear matter system .",
    "meson coupling ) and the lower panel is with @xmath1meson coupling . ]    the fermi energy of both proton and neutron increases with density for their fermionic nature . after a certain density ,",
    "the fermi energy of the nucleon exceeded the rest mass energy of the nucleon ( @xmath151000 mev ) , and strange particles ( @xmath84 ) are produced . as a result ,",
    "the equations of state of the star becomes soft and gives a smaller star mass compare to the neutron star containing only protons , neutrons and electrons .",
    "the decrease in star mass in the presence of whole baryon octet can be understood from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . from the figure it is clear that @xmath0-meson has a great impact on the production of hyperons .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath1meson accelerate the strange particle production .",
    "for example , the evolution of @xmath85 takes place at density @xmath86 in absence of @xmath1meson .",
    "however , it produces at @xmath87 when @xmath1meson is there in the system .",
    "similarly , analyzing the evolution of other baryons , we notice that although the early production of baryons in the presence of @xmath1meson is not proportionate to each other , in each case the yield is faster .",
    "a significant shifting towards lower density is maximum for heaviest hyperon ( @xmath88 ) and minimum for nucleon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath89 evolves at @xmath90 = 6.5 @xmath91 for a non-@xmath0 system and @xmath90@xmath155.0 @xmath91 for medium when @xmath1meson is included .",
    "thus , the @xmath1coupling has a sizable impact on the production of hyperons like @xmath92 .",
    "in summary , using the effective field theory approach , we discussed the effect of isovector scalar meson on hyperon star .",
    "inclusion of @xmath0-meson with g2 parameter set , we have investigated the static and rotating stellar properties of neutron star with hyperons .",
    "we fitted the parameter and see the variation of g@xmath49 and g@xmath50 at a constant symmetry energy for both the nuclear and neutron matter .",
    "with the help of g2+@xmath0 model , for static and rotating stars without hyperon , core we get the maximum mass of @xmath152@xmath14 and @xmath152.4@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this prediction of masses is in agreement with the recent observation of @xmath93@xmath94 of the stars .",
    "however , with hyperon core the maximum mass obtained are @xmath151.4@xmath14 and @xmath151.6@xmath14 for static and rotating hyperon stars , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated the production of whole baryon octet with variation in density .",
    "we find that the particle fraction changes a lot in presence of @xmath1meson coupling . when there is @xmath1meson in the system the evolution of baryons are faster compare to a non-@xmath0 system .",
    "this effect is significant for heavier masses and minimum for lighter baryon .",
    "hence , one can conclude that the yield of baryon / hyperons depends very much on the mesons couplings .",
