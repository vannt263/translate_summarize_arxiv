    "stephan s quintet ( @xcite ; hereafter sq ) , also known as hickson compact group 92 @xcite , is the first discovered compact galaxy group .",
    "it is located in the constellation pegasus .",
    "sq consists of five galaxies ( ngc 7319 , ngc 7318a , ngc 7318b , ngc 7317 , and ngc 7320 , cf . also fig .",
    "[ morph ] ) with an estimated distance to earth of @xmath2 94 mpc @xcite .",
    "sq is famous for a physical adjacency between four of the galaxies ( ngc 7319 , 7318a , 7318b , and 7317 ) , whereby strong interactions between three of these members are apparently causing tidal tails , a strong group - wide shock visible in x - ray @xcite and radio emission @xcite , and a region of active star formation northern of the colliding galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fifth galaxy , ngc 7320 , is observed to be a much closer foreground galaxy and is not part of the interacting group @xcite .",
    "it has a recessional velocity of @xmath2 740 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "three of the four physically related galaxies , the main galaxy ngc 7319 as well as ngc 7317 and ngc 7318a , have a similar recessional velocity of @xmath2 6640 - 6670 km s@xmath3 @xcite and represent the core of the compact group ( c.f . fig . [ morph ] ) .",
    "ngc 7318b is observed to be a high - speed intruder ( @xmath2 5770 km s@xmath3 ) and seems to interact with the igm within the main system for the first time @xcite .",
    "finally , there is a sixth galaxy , ngc 7320c , which shows a similar recessional velocity ( @xmath2 5990 km s@xmath3 ) as the core of the compact group @xcite and is therefore suggested to interact with ngc 7319 @xcite , because it reveals connected tidal features in the eastern large tidal tail ( cf . the outer tail in fig .",
    "[ morph ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is most likely also part of the compact group @xcite .",
    "radio observations reveal the presence of magnetic fields in most late - type galaxies of the local universe .",
    "the field strengths range from a few @xmath4 g in isolated quiet galaxies up to about 50 @xmath4 g in starburst galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the intergalactic magnetic field is usually estimated to be less than 0.01 @xmath4 g ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy interactions can cause magnetic fields which are much stronger compared to individual galaxies ( @xcite ) . in this context , the sq is particularly interesting because it shows both galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - igm interactions .",
    "the latter is mainly visible on the basis of the prominent ridge of x - ray and radio emission crossing the system .",
    "@xcite estimate the minimum - energy magnetic field strength within the shock region of sq to @xmath2 10 @xmath4 g .",
    "the morphology of an interacting galaxy system strongly depends on the initial properties of the progenitors .",
    "numerical simulations can provide insights into the properties of the initial progenitor galaxies , as well as possible formation scenarios .",
    "so far , simulations of galaxy interactions were predominantly focusing on stellar dynamics , gas flows , star formation , supermassive black holes and feedback from stars and black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , over the past few years , the interest in simulations of magnetic fields in galactic environments has grown substantially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "synthetic radio maps of the interacting system of the antennae galaxies were recently presented by @xcite .",
    "they showed radio and polarization maps calculated from their spmhd simulations to be in good morphological and quantitative agreement with observations , implying that the simulations have the capability to follow the magnetic field evolution in a highly interacting nonlinear environment .    despite an enormous number of observational studies of sq , revealing different features at different wavelengths , numerical simulations of this system are very rare , due to the difficulties of many free parameters in modeling such a complex interacting system .",
    "the simulated models for sq commonly exclude the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 but include ngc 7320c as a member of the galaxy group .",
    "furthermore , ngc 7317 does not show any visible features of an ongoing or past interaction .",
    "therefore , it is usually not taken into account in the simulations . as a first basis for more detailed studies",
    ", @xcite performed collisionless gravitational n - body simulations proposing a possible formation scenario for sq .",
    "their simulation is mainly focusing on reproducing the stellar large - scale structure of sq .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an extended model including a gaseous component and different galaxy models , suggesting a different formation history .",
    "the global morphology of the system is well represented in their simulation , supporting also the idea that the large - scale shock within the system is caused by the interaction of ngc 7318b with the intragroup igm .",
    "however , until now , detailed numerical studies of the sq concerning star formation , temperature , magnetic fields , x - ray and radio emission are still missing .",
    "therefore , within the presented work , we perform spmhd studies of sq on the basis of the two existing models by @xcite and @xcite . thereby , we place a particular focus on the properties of the gaseous component , i.e. on the star formation rate , the temperature , and the magnetic field .",
    "we also investigate the presence of the shock front in the x - ray and radio emission .",
    "our synthetic radio maps are calculated for different frequencies , allowing a better comparability with observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the main observational properties of sq .",
    "section 3 briefly summerizes the existing models of sq and presents our extended initial conditions .",
    "the numerical method is described in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present the results of our simulated sq models , including star formation regions , temperature distribution , x - ray emission , magnetic field structure , radio emission and polarization maps .",
    "we discuss the two different sq models in section 6 .",
    "finally , we summerize and discuss our findings in section 7 .",
    "sq is probably the most studied compact galaxy group .",
    "the system shows interesting tidal features resulting from one or more strong interactions of the galaxies , namely the outer tail and the inner tail ( cf .",
    "[ morph ] ) .",
    "it was suggested that the outer tail could have formed earlier in time by an interaction event between ngc 7319 and an intruder , whereas the development of the inner tail seems to be caused by a more recent event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore the tails are sometimes also referred to the old and young tails .",
    "note , however , that there are three different formation scenarios concerning the tails , which are still under discussion ( see end of this section ) .",
    "the outer tail is extending to the southeast of ngc 7319 and is mostly covered by the foreground galaxy ngc 7320 .",
    "the inner tail runs parallel to the outer tail below ngc 7319 and shows a higher surface brightness @xcite and an active star formation @xcite . at its eastern end",
    ", the inner tail is pointing towards ngc 7320c . north of ngc 7318a and ngc 7318b",
    "there are two tidal arms extending from the galaxies , which belong to a region of active star formation @xcite .",
    "a region of enhanced x - ray and radio emission is observed between ngc 7319 and ngc 7318b .",
    "this region is widely interpreted as a large shock front ( cf .",
    "[ morph ] ) resulting from a collision of the high - speed intruder ngc 7318b with the cold igm @xcite .",
    "originally , the large shock was discovered in the 21 cm westerborg radio continuum map by @xcite ( see fig . [ xu ] ) .",
    "later , the prominent ridge was shown to be also present on observed x - ray maps @xcite . due to the additional , albeit faint , evidence of the ridge in observations within the optical wavelength",
    ", @xcite suggested that the shock front contains ionized gas and cold dust as well as hot thermal electrons , relativistic electrons and strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , the shock region between ngc 7319 and ngc 7318b is not the only radio source in sq ( cf .",
    "[ xu ] ) : further observed regions of enhanced radio emission are the innermost parts of ngc 7319 and ngc 7318a . also , the region north of ngc 7318a and ngc 7318b , which is observed to have a high star formation rate ( see below ) , is also found to emit synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the star formation activity in sq is believed to be triggered by the interactions and can be measured in uv @xcite .",
    "the system reveals several regions of active star formation ( @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 ) , such as the inner disc of ngc 7318b , the disc of ngc 7319 and the star - forming region in the north of the galaxy pair ngc 7318a / b .",
    "@xcite found active star formation regions in the shock to be located in the intruder galaxy and at either end of the radio shock , whereas the shock ridge itself seems to host only regions of weak star formation .",
    "additional regions of weak star formation ( @xmath7 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 ) are found in the outer disc of ngc 7318b , within the inner and outer tails and in the overlap region of the tail @xcite .",
    "the outer and the inner tails are the result of interactions within sq . therefore , any model suggesting an interaction history for sq should be able to reproduce the structure and age of these features .",
    "three different possible interaction scenarios discussed in the literature meet this requirement .",
    "the first scenario suggests a formation of the outer tail at an earlier time than the formation of the inner tail .",
    "@xcite proposed that the outer tail is the result of an encounter between the galaxies ngc 7320c and ngc 7319 .",
    "the inner tail is suggested to have formed later due to an encounter of ngc 7319 with ngc 7318a .",
    "the second possible scenario also suggests a formation of the tails at different times but both resulting from passages of ngc 7320c over ngc 7319 .",
    "based on the fact that both the outer and the inner tails are directed towards ngc 7320c , @xcite and also @xcite proposed a bound orbit of ngc 7320c around ngc 7319 , where the first interaction created the outer and a subsequent passage the inner tail .",
    "the third scenario assumes a formation of both tails by only one interaction event of ngc 7320c and ngc 7319 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) thus suggesting the same formation age for the two tails .",
    "although the common opinion favors different formation times of the tails due to i.e. different star formation rates and cluster ages within the tails ( e.g. @xcite ) , this issue is still under discussion @xcite .",

    "this method allows for a galaxy model consisting of a cold dark matter halo , an exponential stellar disc , a stellar bulge ( all of these components being collisionless gravitational n - body particles ) and an exponential gaseous disc ( sph particles ) .",
    "we included a gaseous disc component using a disc gas fraction of f = 0.2 to all of the galaxy models .",

    "ngc 7318a was indeed set up with a disc , but the angular and random velocities are representing an elliptical .",
    "surprisingly , the total masses of the galaxies are roughly a factor of 10 smaller compared to the sq model of @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the galactic masses of sq model b are roughly a factor of 10 smaller compared to sq model a. as lower galactic masses imply lower equipartition energies , the enhancement of the gaseous properties is commonly lower for sq model b. * the regions of active star formation within sq model a are found mainly in the discs of the galaxies , and also within the inner tail and between ngc 7319 and the pair ngc 7318a / b .",
    "the latter partly coincides with the region of the large shock . within sq model b ,",
    "the regions of active star formation are found within the inner discs of ngc 7319 and the galaxies ngc 7318a / b , but there is no region of active star formation between these galaxies . * the global sfr strongly depends on the initial masses of the galaxies and is significantly higher for the more massive sq model a. * in both models , the temperature of the gas within the galaxies is cooler compared to the igm , which gets heated by shocks and outflows caused by the interactions .",
    "the mean temperature in sq model b is significantly lower compared to sq model a. * the x - ray emission shows the highest luminosities in the region of the large shock between ngc 7319 and the pair ngc 7318a / b within both models , in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the shock region within sq model b is about one order of magnitude smaller compared to sq model a. * we find high values of the magnetic field strength in the region of the large shock and also within outflow regions in both sq models .",
    "the values of the magnetic field strength within sq model b are approximately a factor of 3 smaller compared to sq model a. * the temporal evolution of the mean total magnetic field reveals an amplification of the magnetic field strengths along with the different interactions .",
    "thereby , the increase in the magnetic field strength is more efficient for sq model a. * the synthetic radio maps of both models show a high total and polarized synchrotron intensity within the large shock , within ngc 7319 and around and within ngc 7318a .",
    "this finding agrees well with observations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the large shock revealed by observations of sq is most likely the result of a collision of ngc 7318b with the igm .",
    "the observed ridge of radio emission can therefore be ascribed to shock activity .",
    "the shock front in our simulations is clearly visible in the x - ray and synchrotron emission within both sq models .",
    "we emphasize the importance of shocks for the magnetic field amplification and the enhancement of the synchrotron emission .",
    "whenever a high amount of synchrotron emission is detected in regions between interacting galaxies , it may be ascribed to shock activity .    for future studies ,",
    "a further development of the existing sq models would be essential to draw more detailed conclusions on the extension and strength of the synchrotron emission within sq . as the sq model b results in a lower enhancement of the gaseous properties mainly because of the smaller masses , but displays the regions of enhanced x - ray and synchrotron emission quite well , it would be worthwile to use a different scaling of the total masses of sq model b comparable to the total masses of the sq model a. this would lead to a better comparability of the strengths of the gaseous properties of the present - day configuration of the two different models of sq .",
    "another particular focus in further studies should thereby be placed on the position and extension of the galaxy pair ngc 7318a / b , which we found to significantly affect the extension and structure of the large shock in sq . as in our simulations",
    "the used particle masses are of the order of the mass of the largest molecular clouds , small - scale turbulence within the large shock region as recently observed by @xcite can not be modeled in our work .",
    "therefore , further numerical simulations focusing on smaller scales would lead to a deeper understanding of the involved processes of shock activity , especially shocks wrapped around clouds and cloud like structures .",
    "furthermore , observations of the radio emission ridge at different frequencies would be of particular interest in order to gain new insights into the shock region",
    ". this knowledge could then be used as a basis for further improvements of numerical sq models .",
