    "the authors of the paper @xcite investigate theoretically the flux quantization and vortex entry in a thin rectangular superconducting loop ( with thickness much smaller than the coherence length @xmath0 and the penetration depth @xmath1 , width @xmath2 and lateral sizes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) under influence of a transport electric current applied through the normal contacts size equal to the loop width and of a magnetic field @xmath5 perpendicular to the plane of the loop .",
    "they refer in the introduction on some results of transport measurements of asymmetric superconducting loop @xcite , including our one @xcite , making urgent their theoretical investigation of the complexity of the problem rising if asymmetry is introduced .",
    "below they note about a similarity of behaviour of the output voltage on the applied field obtained in their paper @xcite and experimentally in our work @xcite . in the conclusion",
    "the authors claim that they theoretical results @xcite relate to our experimental efforts in the field @xcite .",
    "we must say that this claim is a consequence of misunderstanding of our experimental results @xcite as well as the results of other authors @xcite .",
    "we should explain in this comment that the method used in @xcite is not valid for a description both the critical current oscillations @xcite and the dc voltage oscillation @xcite .",
    "it can not used also for a description of the little - parks oscillations @xcite . in order to avoid the muddle we use the term `` little - parks oscillations '' only for the resistance oscillations observed first by little and parks @xcite .",
    "first of all we should note that a notion about vortex entry used in @xcite misleads when processes of measurements @xcite should be described .",
    "the magnetic field dependencies of the critical currents @xmath6 and @xmath7 were determined in @xcite by measuring periodically repeating current - voltage characteristics ( a period of 10 hz ) in a slowly varying magnetic field @xmath8 ( a period of approximately 0.01 hz ) as follows .",
    "first , the condition that the structure was in the superconducting state was checked .",
    "next , after the threshold voltage was exceeded ( this voltage , set above induced voltages and noises of the measuring system , determined the minimum measurable critical current ) , magnetic field and critical current ( with a delay of about @xmath9 ) were switched on .",
    "this procedure allowed to measure sequentially critical currents in the positive @xmath10 and negative @xmath11 directions with respect to the external measuring current @xmath12 .",
    "measurements of one @xmath6 or @xmath7 dependence ( 1000 values ) took about 100 s.    thus , the ring ( loop ) was switched between superconducting and normal states at each @xmath10 or @xmath11 measurement by the measuring current @xmath12 varying periodically between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , see fig.1 .",
    "the measurements @xcite was made only in the temperature region @xmath15 where the current - voltage characteristics of single aluminium ring exhibit hysteresis and a sharp transition of the entire structure both to the normal and superconducting state , fig.1 . because of the requirement that the complex pair wave function @xmath16 must be single - valued @xmath17 the pair momentum @xmath18 @xmath19 ( see the relation ( 1 ) in @xcite or ( 2 ) in @xcite ) and the persistent current @xmath20 circulating in the ring can not be equal zero in superconducting state when the magnetic flux @xmath21 inside @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the flux quantum ; @xmath24 is the amplitude of the persistent current oscillations ( when @xmath25 changes between -0.5 and 0.5 ) in a ring with section @xmath26 and pairs density @xmath27 which may vary along the ring circumference @xmath22 ; @xmath28 @xcite . the quantum number @xmath29 , describing the angular momentum of each @xmath30 and all superconducting pairs @xmath31 , is any integer number according to the requirement of quantization . but the measurements @xcite indicate that the same quantum number @xmath29 is chosen almost always at each ring transition in superconducting state in a give magnetic field @xmath32 .",
    "different numbers , @xmath29 and @xmath33 , or @xmath29 and @xmath34 are chosen only in peculiar rings @xcite .",
    "it is observed because of the predominate probability @xmath35 of the permitted state ( 1 ) with minimal energy @xmath36 the permitted state spectrum of real superconducting loop is strongly discrete @xmath37 : @xmath38 at @xmath39 and typical value @xmath40 @xcite .     a typical current - voltage characteristic ( cvc ) of single aluminium ring at @xmath39 .",
    "the ring with radius @xmath41 , the photos of which are shown , jumps from superconducting into normal state when the value of the external current @xmath42 reaches the critical values @xmath43 or @xmath44 and comes back into superconducting state when the @xmath42 value decries down to @xmath45 .",
    "the arrows along cvc indicate the direction of the @xmath46 change in time .",
    "the ring photos are shown in order to accentuate that the angular momentum of the mobile charge carriers changes on a macroscopic value @xmath47 at the transitions between superconducting and normal states because of the change of the circular electric current between @xmath48 and @xmath49 . ]",
    "thus , the permitted states with @xmath50 is observed at the measurement of the critical current @xcite .",
    "these permitted states give predominate contribution to the values of the dc voltage and resistance at the observations of the dc voltage and the little - parks oscillation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our experiments @xcite the authors @xcite consider the permitted states with @xmath51 . in the case considered in @xcite",
    "the vortex penetrates inside the loop or the quantum number @xmath29 changes when the critical current is reached in a loop segment with increasing applied current or magnetic field . our experimental results @xcite corroborate that the critical current of one - dimensional ( i.e. @xmath52 , @xmath53 loop is equal approximately the depairing current and therefore corresponds to the depairing velocity @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the velocity ( 1 ) in a loop with approximately homogeneous section @xmath55 reaches the critical value @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the quantum number @xmath29 does not correspond , in general , to minimal kinetic energy ( 2 ) , @xmath51 and the hysteresis of magnetic dependence of loop magnetisation is observed @xcite at @xmath58 .",
    "the notion about vortex entry has a sense when the quantum number @xmath29 changes in @xcite on @xmath59 at @xmath60 , because measurable parameters connected with the pair momentum ( 1 ) change in this case .",
    "but it is absurd to say that @xmath61 vortices penetrate into a loop at its transition to superconducting state in the magnetic field @xmath62 .",
    "it is more correct to say that a qualitative transition from continuous to strong discrete spectrum of permitted states of the mobile charge carriers takes place in this case , see fig1 in @xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite could not have even a possibility to describe our experimental results @xcite using the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation because the time - dependent gl theory can not describe this qualitative transition between states with different connectivity of wave function @xcite .",
    "a careful consideration of the process of the @xmath63 measurement @xcite reveals a puzzle which is observed also in the meissner effect .",
    "hirsch wonders fairly @xcite that this puzzle is ignored : _",
    "`` strangely , the question of what is the force propelling the mobile charge carriers and the ions in the superconductor to move in direction opposite to the electromagnetic force in the meissner effect was essentially never raised nor answered''_. it is obvious that the velocity of the mobile charge carriers , the circular current @xmath64 and the angular momentum @xmath65 change at the transition both in normal state at @xmath66 and in superconducting state at @xmath67 , fig.1 .",
    "the angular momentum changes on a macroscopic value @xmath68 equal @xmath69 at the square @xmath70 and the amplitude @xmath71 of the persistent current @xmath72 of the rings measured in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the circular current @xmath73 decays in a ring with an inductance @xmath74 a non - zero resistance @xmath75 during the relaxation time @xmath76 because of the dissipation force @xmath77 acting between electrons and the crystalline lattice of ions .",
    "therefore there is not a problem with the angular momentum change from @xmath78 to @xmath79 after the transition in normal state .",
    "the current decays down to zero at the measurements in @xcite because of the infinitesimality of the relaxation time @xmath80 ( at @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the rings ) in comparison with the measurement time @xmath83 of one current - voltage characteristic .",
    "all theories of superconductivity and quantum mechanics predict the change from @xmath79 to @xmath78 after the transition in superconducting state because superconducting state with the pair angular momentum @xmath84 is forbidden at @xmath85 ( 1 ) .",
    "but no theory can say what is the force propelling the mobile charge carriers in this case .",
    "no theory can say also how quickly the average velocity of the mobile charge carriers should change from @xmath86 to @xmath87 equal @xmath88 at the ring radius @xmath41 and @xmath89 .",
    "the basis of the theoretical investigation @xcite , the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , includes the gl relaxation time @xmath90 describing the change in time of the density of superconducting pairs @xmath91 .",
    "but the force propelling the mobile charge and a time of the velocity change @xcite can not be deduced from the time - dependent gl theory or any other theory of superconductivity known now .",
    "therefore the authors @xcite could consider theoretically only the case which differs in essence from the one of our measurements of the critical current @xcite .",
    "their theoretical consideration @xcite can not have also any relation to the observations of the dc voltage @xcite and the little - parks oscillations @xcite .",
    "these observations reveal obvious paradox .",
    "it is well known that an electrical current must rapidly ( during the relaxation time @xmath76 ) decay in a loop with a resistance @xmath75 if magnetic flux inside the ring does not change in time @xmath92 .",
    "but the observations of the quantum oscillations of the resistance , @xmath93 @xcite and magnetic susceptibility @xmath94 @xcite give evidence that the persistent current can not decay in spite of non - zero resistance without the faraday electrical field @xmath95 .",
    "moreover the measurements of the little - parks oscillations at low values of the measuring current @xmath46 @xcite gives evidence that the persistent current can flow against electric field .",
    "the same paradox is obvious also in the observations of the dc voltage oscillations @xcite .",
    "these paradoxes are direct consequence of the puzzle considered above .",
    "there is important to note that both the persistent current and the loop resistance are not zero on average in time @xmath96 , @xmath97 in the process of the critical current measurements @xcite . for case of the real measurements @xcite",
    "@xmath98 is a time longer than the period @xmath99 of measuring current variation and much shorted than the period @xmath100 of magnetic field variation .",
    "according to the current - voltage characteristic shown on fig.1 the ring resistance equals the resistance in normal state @xmath101 during the time from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , from @xmath104 to @xmath105 , from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , and @xmath108 during the time from @xmath103 to @xmath104 and from @xmath105 to @xmath106 when @xmath109 .",
    "therefore these values on average in time should be equal @xmath110 and @xmath111 when @xmath112 .    the average velocity of mobile charge carriers circulating in the loop changes from @xmath113 to @xmath114 because of the dissipation force @xmath115 at each transition in normal state at @xmath116 and from @xmath114 to @xmath113 because of the quantization ( 1 ) at each transition in superconducting state at @xmath117 , fig.1 .",
    "the latter explains why the persistent current can not decay in spite of non - zero dissipation @xcite for example in the little - parks effect @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the dissipation power equal @xmath119 without external current @xmath120 may be weak @xmath121 at a low frequency @xmath122 of switching between superconducting and normal state .",
    "but it can not be zero at @xmath123 and @xmath124 as well as the dissipation force @xmath125 \\approx -2\\pi \\hbar   ( \\overline { n } - \\phi /\\phi _ { 0 } ) \\neq 0 $ ] when @xmath126 . the obvious equality @xmath127 taken on average in time @xmath98 gives a `` force '' balance @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the momentum change in a time unity of mobile charge carrier because of the quantization called in @xcite `` quantum force '' .",
    "the quantum force replaces formally the force @xmath130 of the faraday electric field @xmath131 and can explain @xcite the paradoxical phenomena observed at the measurements of the little - parks @xcite and the dc voltage @xcite oscillations .",
    "the quantum force can not be deduced on the base of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "therefore the behaviour of the output voltage on the applied field observed in @xcite , in particular shown on fig . 4 in @xcite can not be similar with anything obtained in @xcite .",
    "we regret that the authors @xcite could not understand totally the essence of the behaviour of the output voltage shown on fig . 4 in @xcite .",
    "it is clearly written in @xcite that because of the presence of alternating - sign @xmath132 oscillations ( shown on fig .",
    "5 ) , the total output voltage ( shown on fig .",
    "4 ) is the sum @xmath133 of the voltage @xmath134 depending on the external dc current @xmath12 and @xmath132 .",
    "the little - parks oscillations @xmath135 have extremums at @xmath136 and @xmath137 , see fig.3 in @xcite whereas the extremums of the alternating - sign oscillations @xmath132 are observed between @xmath136 and @xmath137 , see fig.5 in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the little - parks oscillations @xmath138 shown on fig.4 in @xcite equals approximately @xmath139 and of the @xmath140 oscillations shown on fig.5 in @xcite equals approximately @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the extremums of the total output voltage @xmath142 are observed at @xmath136 and @xmath137 when @xmath143 , fig.3 in @xcite , and between @xmath136 and @xmath137 when @xmath144 , fig.5 in @xcite .",
    "no result of @xcite can have any relation to the both cases .",
    "the publication @xcite reveals the lack of understanding that existing theories of superconductivity can not provide a complete description of all quantum phenomena observed in superconductors .",
    "the force - free momentum change of the mobile charge carriers at the transition into superconducting state is not only puzzle which no theory of superconductivity can solve .",
    "we would like to draw readers attention on a paradoxical contradiction between theoretical prediction and results of measurements of magnetic dependencies of the critical current of asymmetric superconducting rings revealed in our works @xcite . a simple theoretical consideration",
    "@xcite based on the condition of quantization ( 1 ) predicts that the critical current of symmetric ( i.e. with the same width @xmath145 and length @xmath146 of the ring arms ) ring should oscillate in magnetic field @xmath32 in accordance with the relation @xmath147 . the pair velocity ( 1 ) and the persistent current corresponding to the minimal energy ( 2 ) should jump at @xmath137 from @xmath148 to @xmath149 with the quantum number change from @xmath29 to @xmath33 .",
    "this jump should not be observed at measurement of the critical current of symmetric ring because @xmath150 .",
    "but the jump of the critical current @xmath151 should be observed at measurement of the asymmetric ring with different width @xmath152 , see fig.19 in @xcite , or different length @xmath153 @xcite of the ring arms .",
    "our measurements @xcite as well as measurements of other authors of symmetric rings have corroborated the theoretical prediction .",
    "but measurements of asymmetric rings made first in our works @xcite have revealed qualitative discrepancies between theoretical and experimental magnetic dependencies of the critical current .",
    "first of all we have discovered that the jump predicted because of the quantum number @xmath29 change is absent on the experimental dependencies measured on rings both with @xmath152 @xcite and @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "these results are very strange because the observed periodicity can be connected only with the @xmath29 change and the quantum number can not change on a value lesser than unity according to the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "other paradoxical result discovered at measurement of rings with @xmath152 is the shift of the critical current oscillations @xmath154 with the appearance of ring asymmetry up to @xmath155 at @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "this shift of @xmath157 and @xmath158 in opposite direction provides the anisotropy @xmath159 of the critical current of asymmetric ring and the explanation of the rectification effect @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath154 extremums should be observed at @xmath136 and @xmath137 according to the condition of the quantization ( 1 ) and can not be observed at @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the qualitative discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results should be explained .",
