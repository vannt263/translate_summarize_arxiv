    "the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) method measures the intrinsic pixel - to - pixel intensity variance in a galaxy image resulting from statistical fluctuations in the numbers and luminosities of the stars within individual pixels . since the sbf signal is convolved with the point spread function , one measures the fourier space amplitude of the power spectrum on the scale of the psf in the galaxy - subtracted .",
    "the ratio of sbf variance to galaxy surface brightness has units of flux and scales inversely with the square of the galaxy distance .",
    "this ratio is usually converted to a magnitude called @xmath4 .",
    "the distance can be determined if the absolute @xmath0 , which depends on both the photometric bandpass and the stellar population , is known from empirical or theoretical calibration .",
    "sbf measurements in multiple bands can provide useful distance - independent information on the stellar content of a galaxy .    the sbf method was first quantified by tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) .",
    "the cefal stellar populations workshop where this contribution was presented marked an interesting anniversary , being twenty years to the month since the publication of that seminal work .",
    "the first major application of the sbf method was by tonry et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) for a sample of virgo galaxies in the @xmath5 bandpasses .",
    "they also made a first attempt to predict the behavior of @xmath0  as a function of galaxy color .",
    "soon afterward , tonry ( 1991 ) presented the first fully empirical sbf calibration , giving @xmath6 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "following these early efforts , a large ground - based sbf survey ( tonry et  al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) presented a redetermination of the empirical @xmath8-band sbf calibration and measured distances for 300 early - type galaxies and spiral bulges within about 40  mpc . for a comprehensive review of the first decade of sbf studies , see blakeslee , ajhar , & tonry ( 1999 ) .",
    "although the major part of sbf research has been concerned with the measurement of extragalactic distances , peculiar velocities , and three - dimensional structure in the local universe , recently there has been renewed interest in sbf as a stellar population indicator .",
    "this is because sbf is sensitive to the properties of the brightest stars in a galaxy in a given bandpass , and the detailed evolution of these brightest stars is usually not well constrained , especially for old , metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "there are few if any galactic or magellanic star clusters where such models can be tested directly against resolved stellar systems .",
    "there have been several recent theoretical efforts to predict sbf magnitudes for various bandpasses and stellar populations ( liu et  al .  2000 ;",

    "2004 ; gonzlez - lpezlira et al.2005 ; raimondo et al .",
    "although there is broad agreement in the predictions for the most common sbf bandpasses ( especially @xmath8 band ) , the agreement among different models , and between models and observations , worsens in the near - ir and uv / blue",

    "see also the contributions by m.  cantiello , r.  gonzalez - lopezlira , and g.  raimondo in this volume .",
    "here we simply highlight a few results from recent sbf work related to stellar population issues .",
    "in order to work as a distance indicator , the stellar population dependence of the sbf magnitude must be well calibrated .",
    "this has worked best in the @xmath8 and @xmath2 bands , where the relation between @xmath4  and galaxy color has the smallest scatter ( e.g. , blakeslee et  al .",

    "2.1   sbf as a distance indicator : some recent work _    most of the recent work on sbf distances has focused either on dwarf galaxies in southern groups and clusters observed with large aperture ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , jerjen et  al .  2004 ; mieske et  al .  2006 ; dunn & jerjen 2006 ) or on early - type galaxies observed with the _ hst _",

    "the fit yields a highly precise relative distance modulus of @xmath12 mag ( including systematic uncertainties ) for fornax with respect to virgo .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the method is estimated empirically to be just 0.06  mag for galaxies with @xmath14 , but increases at bluer colors ( the compactness of fornax makes it possible to measure this small intrinsic scatter ) .",
    "mei et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the general behavior ( with a zero - point shift ) of sbf in z_850@xmath10  was reasonably approximated by predictions from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) simple stellar population ( ssp ) models of varying age and metallicity .",
    "however , it is not possible to predict the scatter in the sbf relations from ssp models .",
    "chemo - evolutionary or semi - analytic models are required for this , although some estimates can be made from simple monte carlo simulations ( blakeslee et  al .",
    "2001 ) . a fully successful model should predict the very tight @xmath13  vs @xmath11  relation with increased scatter at the blue end .    at present ,",

    "_    worthey ( 1993b ) showed theoretically that sbf measurements in the uv could provide quantitative information on the presence of extended hot horizontal branch stars in elliptical galaxies and other unresolved stellar systems . according to the models used by worthey",
    ", the presence of a hot horizontal branch could make the @xmath15-band sbf magnitude brighter by 3  mag in a metal - rich early - type galaxy .",
    "the effect at shorter wavelengths , such as the f284w band of _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 , was even larger .",
    "however , the sbf signal is very faint at these wavelengths , and to date there have been no practical demonstrations of the usefulness of @xmath15-band sbf for this purpose . with the coming of large ground - based telescopes equipped with blue sensitive detectors ( and hopefully the uvis channel of wfc3 )",
    "this may soon change .",
    "although the acs / wfc has no sensitivity shortward of 4000 , this instrument ( before its sad demise ) afforded the first samples of reliable @xmath16-band ( f435w ) sbf measurements beyond the local group ( cantiello et  al.2007b ) , which have proven to have interesting implications for stellar population synthesis .",
    "cantiello et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) demonstrated the sensitivity of sbf @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19  colors to the rate of post - agb evolution .",
    "the observational data disagreed with standard model predictions , but cantiello et  al .  showed that the models could be brought into agreement with the data by adjusting the post - agb evolution to agree with that inferred for resolved stars in  m32 .",
    "the hot post - agb stars have a proportionately larger effect on @xmath17  than on @xmath19 .    however , this solution was not unique , since an unmodeled hot horizontal branch or other missing components could also cause the observed discrepancy .",
    "additional sbf measurements in the uv ( to constrain further the properties of the hot component ) and near - ir ( sensitive to the post - agb star progenitors ) could fully resolve this issue .",
    "multi - band optical / ir sbf data are thus relevant to such problems as agb evolution and the uv excess in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , buzzoni & gonzalez - lopezlira 2008 ) .    , but here shown for the _ hst _  nicmos f160w band .",

    "the importance of the tp - agb phase is considerably greater in the near - ir .",
    "the effect of these stars in fact reverses the sense of the dependence of the sbf magnitude on color , so that the near - ir sbf brightens as observed at bluer colors , instead of becoming fainter as it would without the tp - agb .",

    "( 2009 ) for details .",
    "[ fig : padter160 ] ]    blakeslee et  al .",

    "( 2009 ) shows a dramatic demonstration of the effects of the tp - agb phase on near - ir sbf ( in the _",
    "hst_f160w bandpass ) .",
    "for both the padova and teramo / basti sets of models , the inclusion of the tp - agb phase actually reverses the sense of the dependence of the sbf magnitude on integrated color ( at least for age @xmath20  gyr ) .",
    "the original expectations from models were that near - ir sbf magnitudes would brighten at redder colors ( e.g. , worthey 1993a ) .",
    "it was a surprise when the reverse was found observationally ( jensen et  al .",
    "1998 , 2003 ) .",
    "the modeling of the agb phase was likely much of the reason for the erroneous prediction .",
    "for the most part , the inclusion of the agb in population synthesis relies on imperfectly constrained empirical prescriptions , rather than true evolutionary models .",
    "it is evident from the figures and comparisons with observations that nature has ordained a better behaved agb phase than those included in the population models .",
    "the relations between sbf magnitude and integrated color are tighter than might be expected from current models .",
    "sbf data can provide powerful constraints to aid in the development of true agb evolutionary codes for inclusion in the next generation of stellar population models .",
    "until now we have discussed mean colors and sbf magnitudes , but these quantities vary within galaxies , most notably because of radial gradients in stellar population properties .",
    "sbf gradients were known from ground - based data for a few galaxies ( tonry 1991 ; sodemann & thomsen 1995 , 1996 ; tonry et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but until recently there were no systematic studies .",
    "ngc205 was the first galaxy where an sbf gradient was noted .",
    "it is unusual in that its center is blue and it becomes redder outward , the reverse of typical gradients .",
    "this is because the gradient is due to relatively recent central star formation , and therefore an age effect .",
    "the slope of the dependence of _",
    "i@xmath21  on @xmath7  is also shallower than that of the mean dependence for galaxies .",
    "colors and @xmath8-band sbf measurements in a series of concentric annuli are shown for seven early - type galaxies studied by cantiello et  al.(2005 ) with the acs / wfc . in all of these galaxies ,",
    "the color gets bluer and _",
    "i@xmath21  brighter with increasing radial distance from the galaxy center .",
    "the vertical shifts are due to the different galaxy distances ( see cantiello et  al .  2005 , 2007a for details ) .",
    "[ fig : gradients ] ]    cantiello et  al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007a ) have used the acs / wfc to make the first studies of sbf gradients in significant samples of galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : gradients ] ) .",
    "they show that the size of the internal sbf vs color slope for multiple annuli within a galaxy can reveal whether the gradients are due to age or metallicity . in most cases , they are metallicity gradients , but in some cases an age gradient appears equally or more important .",
    "the galaxies with age gradients tend to be bluer and show some evidence for past mergers ( e.g. , ngc1344 ) . at these optical wavelengths ,",
    "age and metallicity variations cause qualitatively similar sbf vs color relations , though with different slopes .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to study internal sbf gradients in the near - ir where pure age or metallicity variations would translate to very different dependences of sbf magnitude on color . with improvements in near - ir instruments , this is now becoming possible .",
    "color is plotted as a function of the `` fluctuation count '' @xmath22 , the difference between sbf magnitude @xmath13  and total @xmath2 magnitude of the galaxy , for galaxies in virgo ( open circles ) fornax ( filled circles ) .",
    "note that @xmath23 , like @xmath11 , is distance - independent and can therefore be used for an alternative calibration of the sbf method ( see  blakeslee et  al .",
    "2009 ) . unlike color",
    ", @xmath24  is also independent of galactic extinction .",
    "the dashed and solid lines show the best - fit linear and quadratic relations , respectively .",
    "@xmath24  is closely related to the stellar mass of the galaxy , and the correlation with color results from the mass - metallicity scaling relation ; the scatter increases at blue colors and low luminosities . [ fig : gznbar ] ]",
    "the distance - independent `` fluctuation  count '' @xmath24  is defined as @xmath25 $ ] ( tonry et  al .",
    "2001 ) , where @xmath26 is the galaxy total luminosity and @xmath27  is the mean `` fluctuation luminosity '' corresponding to magnitude @xmath0 , which depends on the stellar population .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 is a distance - independent galaxy luminosity in units of @xmath27  and scales with the number of stars in the galaxy ( and thus with stellar mass ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : gznbar ] shows the correlation of @xmath24  with color from blakeslee et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a consequence of the mass - metallicity relation . @xmath24  also shows a good correlation with velocity dispersion @xmath29 , tighter than even the mg@xmath30-@xmath29 relation ( blakeslee et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the correlation with color means that @xmath24   can also be used to calibrate sbf distances . depending on the color baseline and properties of the data sample , the sbf calibration based on @xmath24  may show less scatter than that from color ( blakeslee et  al .  2002 , 2009 ) .",
    "however , the calibration is then no longer based purely on stellar population properties , but involves a galaxy mass scaling relation .",
    "thus , luminous blue galaxies and small red galaxies deviate from the calibration , and there may be systematic environmental effects similar those of the fundamental plane . for these reasons ,",
    "the preferred calibration uses galaxy color , but the behavior of @xmath24  itself would be interesting to examine with semi - analytic galaxy modeling .",
    "multi - band sbf studies are a unique and quite promising way of constraining stellar population properties , especially when combined with additional information .",
    "sbf data could help enormously in understanding tp - agb evolution and hot stellar components in elliptical galaxies .",
    "although there has been much theoretical modeling in this regard , the observational studies to date have been limited .",
    "the current lack of an efficient large - format space - based camera is a big blow , but currently available large - format near - ir imagers and the coming generation of multi - band digital sky surveys provide interesting prospects for new sbf studies .",
    "we have only scratched the surface of this field .",
