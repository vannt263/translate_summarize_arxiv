    "empirical likelihood ( el ) method introduced by owen ( 1988 ) has become a widely applicable tool for constructing confidence regions in nonparametric problems due to its appealing asymptotic distribution of the likelihood - ratio - type statistic which is same as the one under the parametric settings . however , the established methods of el are mainly for independent observations and therefore are difficult to apply to dependent observations such as time series data .",
    "progress in applying the el method on different time series models has been made by different researchers .",
    "for example , mykland ( 1995 ) built up the connection between the dual likelihood and the empirical likelihood through the martingale estimating equations and applied to time series model .",
    "kitamura ( 1997 ) proposed the empirical likelihood of the blocks of observations to study the weakly dependent processes .",
    "chan and ling ( 2006 ) derived the empirical likelihood method for garch models .",
    "chan and liu ( 2010 ) considered the bartlett corrections of empirical likelihood for short memory time series .",
    "monti ( 1997 ) extended the el method to stationary time series by using the whittle s ( 1953 ) estimation method to obtain an m - estimator of the periodogram ordinates of time series models which are asymptotically independent .",
    "this method reduced the dependent data problem to an independent data problem .",
    "then the original el method is applied and similar asymptotic results have been obtained .",
    "chun ( 2011 ) extended monit s results to long - memory time series models .",
    "however , as chen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) pointed out , computing profile empirical likelihood function which involves constrained maximization requires that the convex hull of the estimating equation must have the zero vector as an interior point .",
    "when the required computational problem has no solution , owen ( 2001 ) suggested assigning  @xmath0  to the log - el statistic .",
    "chen et al.(2008 ) mentioned there are two drawbacks in doing so . to remedy the drawback of el method , chen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed an adjusted empirical likelihood ( ael ) for independent observations by adding an artificial term to guarantee the zero vector to be within the convex hull , therefore , the solution always exists . in their work , they have showed the asymptotic results of the ael are same as that of the el .",
    "furthermore , this method can achieve the improved coverage probabilities without using bartlett - correction or bootstrap calibration .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an adjusted empirical likelihood method to extend monti s method by adopting chen s idea .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the ael for m - estimators is derived .",
    "section 3 reviews briefly the whittle s estimator based on the periodogram .",
    "the ael for a stationary time series model is proposed and the asymptotic distribution of the ael statistic is established in section 4 . the application to arma models",
    "is considered in section 5 .",
    "simulations in section 6 illustrate the coverage probabilities of the proposed ael method for invertible moving average ( ma ) time series model and stationary autoregressive ( ar ) model with various sample sizes , values of parameters and distributions of the noise term .",
    "comparisons to the el method , bartlett - corrected ones have also been made to indicate the advantage of the proposed ael method .",
    "some discussion is provided in section 7 .",
    "the empirical likelihood ( el ) method was introduced by owen ( 1988,1990,1991 ) which combines the reliability from nonparametric methods and flexibility of parametric methods .",
    "the most appealing property of the el method is that the null distribution of the el ratio statistic follows the standard chi - square distribution under mild conditions similar to the one obtained under the parametric settings .",
    "since then , the el method has been extensively used in different areas in statistics . see owen ( 2001 ) for more details of the el method .",
    "however , the el method is designed to deal with the independent observations and has difficulties in applying to dependent observations such as time series .",
    "based on the facts that the periodogram of time series data are asymptotically independent and the parameter of a stationary time series estimated by the whittle s ( 1953 ) method can be viewed as an m - estimator involving periodogram ordinates , monti ( 1997 ) proposed the empirical likelihood version based on m - estimators to reduce a dependent data to an independent data , therefore , owen s el method can be applied .",

    "@xmath6 is estimated by an @xmath7-estimator @xmath8 , which is the solution of @xmath9 with the definition of  @xmath10 the empirical likelihood ratio for any value @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 subject to the constraints:(i ) @xmath13 , ( ii ) @xmath14 , and ( iii ) @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the maximization under the lagrange multiplier method gives @xmath17^{-1 } \\qquad ( j=1,2, ... ,n),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the lagrangian multiplier satisfying constraint ( i ) .",
    "the empirical likelihood ratio statistic is thus defined @xmath19 owen ( 1988 ) showed that @xmath20 is asymptotically distributed as @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , an asymptotic 1-@xmath22 confidence region is given by @xmath23 . under some moment conditions on @xmath24 (",
    "owen 2001 ) , the convex hull @xmath25 contains 0 as its interior point with probability 1 as @xmath26 .",
    "when the parameter @xmath6 is not close to @xmath8 , or when @xmath27 is small , there is a good chance that the solution to constraint ( i ) does nt exist which will raise some computational issues as chen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) mentioned . to overcome this difficulty , chen et al.(2008 ) proposed an adjusted empirical likelihood ( ael ) ratio function by adding @xmath28-th term to guarantee the zero to be an interior point of the convex hull , therefore , the required numerical maximization always has the solution . by doing so , they modified owen s method and applied to independent observations with the establishment of same asymptotic null distribution of the statistic as owen obtained .",
