    "the rapidly evolving field of spincaloritronics @xcite has attracted a lot of attention in the past years . particularly , the transverse spin seebeck effect ( tsse ) , at first sight a seemingly simple effect to measure , has been the target of many experimentalists . however , it turned out that the tsse @xcite , especially when using metallic ferromagnets @xcite , is under strong discussion .",
    "other magneto - thermoelectric effects , like the anomalous nernst effect ( ane ) @xcite and the anisotropic magneto - thermopower ( amtep , also known as the planar nernst effect ( pne ) ) @xcite play an important role in the tsse measurements and contribute to the detected signals .",
    "ane and tsse signals are antisymmetric with respect to the external magnetic field , have the shape of hysteresis loops and both follow the @xmath1 dependence , where @xmath2 is the angle between the magnetization vector @xmath3 and the temperature gradient @xmath4 .",
    "the amtep can be identified by its @xmath5 angular dependence and symmetric shape .",
    "thus , it was postulated that the ane caused by an unintended out - of - plane temperature gradient ( due to heat flux into surrounding area by radiation @xcite and through electrical contacts by thermal conductivity @xcite ) is the main effect masking tsse in metallic ferromagnets .",
    "small static environmental magnetic fields of the earth magnetic field s order of magnitude and lower are typically not considered in experimental set - ups .",

    "we show that the amtep generated by solely in - plane @xmath4 in presence of very small static parasitic magnetic field can produce an significant antisymmetric artifact that shares the @xmath1 dependence with the ane and tsse .",
