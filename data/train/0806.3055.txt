    "microwave sintering is the process in which electromagnetic energy of microwaves is delivered directly to electrons or atoms in materials .",
    "it enables rapid heating that leads to melting and recrystallization of original solid matters .",
    "a laboratory experiment demonstrated that a grained magnetite sample was heated to above @xmath3c within a minute by applied microwaves@xcite .",
    "the amount of energy consumption can be reduced and the release of co@xmath4 gas be halved in the microwave iron making which reduces energy and environmental problems in modern iron industry@xcite .",
    "later it was shown that various metallic oxides including magnetite and titanium oxide with oxygen defects tio@xmath5 ( @xmath6 )",
    "were sintered quickly at the magnetic field maximum ( i.e. the electric field null ) in the microwave cavity experiments@xcite .",
    "the product sintered in the microwave magnetic field was shown to have good magnetic properties as magnets .",
    "the sintering of magnetite / hematite powders of micron sizes is characterized by selective heating .",
    "only the domain of magnetite @xmath7 with strong magnetization was heated to @xmath3c in the microwave magnetic field@xcite , which is much above the curie temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath8c ) .",
    "the adjacent domain of hematite @xmath9 remained at low temperatures .",
    "the microwave sintering of magnetic materials is a non - resonant process that occurs with or without a static magnetic field and for any amplitude of wave magnetic field at a fixed microwave frequency . with ferromagnetic metals , microwave resonance absorption@xcite and the non - resonant bolometric",
    "effect on dc resistance@xcite were observed in ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments under microwaves .",
    "these phenomena required a static magnetic field of specific strength to have resonance with microwaves , and were observed mainly below room temperature , which are attributed to joule heating or eddy current .",
    "the microwave sintering , which occurs under wide range of strength and frequency of microwave magnetic field without a static magnetic field is physically a different process from the fmr process .",
    "to date , the heating of dielectric materials by the microwave electric field was extensively studied@xcite .",
    "we examined the heating of water , salt - contained water and ice by microwaves using molecular dynamics simulation@xcite .",
    "the heating was attributed , respectively , to excitation of electric dipoles , the joule heating of salt ions , and the weakening of the hydrogen - bonded h@xmath10o network by the presence of salt ions .",
    "( pure ice was not heated by 2.5ghz microwave due to tight hydrogen bonds of water molecules . ) for bulk metals , microwaves are reflected at the surface due to skin effects and do not transfer energy , while they penetrate into grained metallic powders ( 10@xmath11 m in diameter ) for a few centimeters and heat them@xcite .",
    "however , the sintering mechanism of metal oxides that have spontaneous magnetization under the magnetic field of microwaves has not been resolved .    in this paper",
    ", we show theoretically that the sintering of particles of magnetic metal oxides , including magnetite and titanium oxide with oxygen defects , by a microwave magnetic field is due to non - resonant response of electron spins in the unfilled 3d shell .",
    "we first use the energy principle and perform the monte carlo simulations . a small spin perturbation in response to an alternating external magnetic field results in a large internal energy change through exchange interactions .",
    "next , studies in the time domain are done by performing dissipative spin dynamics simulation and detecting the linear response of spins .",
    "the temperature and frequency dependence of the heating rate by the microwave magnetic field is obtained on the basis of the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 .",
    "these results agree well with those by the energy principle , and @xmath12 quantitatively accounts for the rapid heating of magnetite in the sintering experiments .",
    "we have used the following procedures in our numerical simulations .",
    "the magnetization of magnetite and hematite is well described by the heisenberg model above the verwey transition temperature ( 120 k)@xcite since electrons are roughly localized@xcite .",
    "the internal energy @xmath13 of the magnetic system is represented by the three - dimensional spin vector @xmath14 of the electron at the i - th site , the exchange interaction coefficient @xmath15 between the i - th and j - th sites , and the external magnetic field @xmath16 of microwaves , which reads @xmath17 the summation of the exchange interactions in the first term is taken over the pairs of nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the magnitude of the spin vector satisfies @xmath18 for the spin angular momentum s. the second term , which may be called the zeeman term , is the scalar product of magnetization @xmath19 and the magnetic field , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the weiss field ( the internal magnetic field ) is @xmath23 t , which is much larger than that of microwaves , where @xmath24 is the effective magneton number of magnetite and @xmath25 is of a few mev .",
    "we also note that the individual spin interaction energy @xmath26 ev is comparable to the thermal energy at room temperature @xmath27 ev .",
    "thus , thermal effects are significant in the sintering process for which temperatures are much above 300 k.    to obtain a thermally equilibrated state , we minimize the internal energy of the spin system eq.(1 ) at a given temperature using the monte carlo method with the metropolis criterion .",
    "a trial random rotation is exerted on one of the spins in the n - th step : the trial is accepted if the internal energy decreases @xmath28 , or if the energy increase satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a random number uniformly generated in the ( 0,1 ) interval , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath32 is temperature ; otherwise the trial is rejected . to proceed further , we have to specify the crystal structure and the exchange interaction coefficients . for magnetite",
    ", the unit cell is a cubic box with the sides of 0.8396 nm at room temperature@xcite and contains 24 irons : 16 of them are @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and occupy all the tetrahedral sites ( a - site , 8 positions ) and half of the octahedral sites ( b - site ) .",
    "the rest of irons are 8 @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , and are located at b - sites .",
    "the exchange interaction coefficients are all negative and satisfy @xmath37@xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 mev , where the former is larger in magnitude than the theoretically estimated value @xmath40 mev@xcite to reproduce @xmath0 in our model .",
    "using the procedures described in sec.ii , we first calculate the equilibrated state without an applied magnetic field for the periodic crystal of magnetite with @xmath41 unit cells . below @xmath0 , spins are ordered along the c - axis due to the exchange interactions , with the spins at a - sites and those at b - sites oriented oppositely . the temperature dependence of magnetization calculated with our model is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the validity of our model is confirmed by the numerical result that the spontaneous magnetization decreases monotonically with temperature and vanishes above @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "our calculated value @xmath42 at 300 k roughly agrees with the experimental value @xmath43@xcite , where @xmath44 with @xmath45 the number of irons in the system .",
    "next , we apply a slowly varying magnetic field @xmath16 to the equilibrium obtained above , and perform the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the varying speed of the magnetic field is chosen to be slow enough for spins to relax to the state of an instantaneous magnetic field .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field is 1 t unless otherwise specified , which is still by two orders of magnitude less than the weiss field .",
    "spins relax in orientation under the magnetic field and the internal energy @xmath46 depends on the magnitude and orientation of @xmath47 .",
    "we evaluate the difference between the maximum and minimum of the internal energy during a period of the magnetic field change , @xmath48 here , the superscript ( mc ) stands for `` monte carlo '' simulation .",
    "the energy @xmath49 that is to be released irreversibly to lattice atoms by dissipation process , possibly by spin - lattice interactions@xcite , is obtained by subtracting from @xmath50 the reversible energy change , @xmath51 .",
    "the latter is obtained by solving the spin dynamics equation without dissipation , @xmath52 the energy difference @xmath49 can be used as the index of heating by the microwave magnetic field .",
    "this is verified later by agreement of the estimation based on the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility with the @xmath49 here and also the experimental value of the heating rate .",
    "figure 2 shows the changes in ( a ) the average magnetization in the z direction ( c - axis ) , ( b ) the total internal energy ( solid line ) and the contribution of the zeeman term ( dashed line ) at 700 k against ( c ) the alternating magnetic field which is parallel to the c - axis . in the present case , the magnetization @xmath53 stays negative along the z - axis , and the zeeman term @xmath20 takes positive or negative value according to whether @xmath16 is parallel or anti - parallel to the c - axis . in the phase where the applied magnetic field becomes more negative ,",
    "the magnitude of magnetization increases due to alignment of spins parallel to the c - axis , and the internal energy becomes minimal in this phase of the magnetic field .",
    "we note that the large change in the internal energy occurs through the exchange interactions because the energy associated with the zeeman term is small and reversible , with the former by a factor of @xmath54 larger than the latter , as depicted in fig.2(b ) .",
    "in fact , the contribution of the zeeman term is small and roughly the same as that obtained with the dissipationless spin dynamics eq.(3 ) .",
    "the distribution functions at the @xmath55th monte carlo step in fig.2 are shown in fig.3 . the x and z directions",
    "are taken along the a- and c - axes , respectively . in the x direction ,",
    "the spins form centered boltzmann distributions and no magnetization occurs along this direction .",
    "( the shaded areas correspond to the @xmath56 at a - sites . )",
    "ferrimagnetization occurs along the z direction .",
    "the @xmath57 spins at a - sites are anti - parallel to the z - axis and those of @xmath58 and @xmath57 at b - sites are parallel to it .",
    "the change in the orientations in response to the microwave magnetic field is subtle , yet it gives rise to a maximum in the magnitude of magnetization periodically , as shown in fig.2(a ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the calculated temperature dependence of the internal energy difference @xmath59 when the microwave magnetic field is parallel either to the c - axis ( filled circles ) or to the a - axis of magnetite ( open circles ) .",
    "the difference in the energy becomes largest when the polarization of the magnetic field is parallel to the c - axis , and it increases linearly with temperature up to @xmath0 .",
    "the change in the reversible energy @xmath60 and that in the zeeman term for the former case are shown by crosses and filled squares , respectively .",
    "the energy change @xmath60 is similar to that in the spontaneous magnetization which decreases with temperature and vanishes above @xmath0 .",
    "the change in the zeeman term is almost the same as @xmath60 but is finite for @xmath61 .",
    "the zeeman term in the monte carlo simulation remains finite because an induced magnetization appears synchronously with and along the magnetic field independently of its polarization in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "the major contribution to the internal energy difference @xmath49 is attributed to the exchange interactions since the change in the zeeman term is reversible and thus almost subtracted in @xmath49 .",
    "the temperature dependences shown in fig.4 are in excellent agreement with the sintering experiments in the microwave magnetic field@xcite , where the heating of magnetite was enhanced at @xmath62 and continued to much above @xmath0 .",
    "an argument that involves time scales as well as the temperature dependence of heating is made possible by solving the dissipative spin dynamics . here",
    ", the term @xmath63 is added to the righthand side of eq.(3 ) .",
    "namely , we solve @xmath64     -(\\bf{s}_{i } -\\bf{s}_{i0})/ \\tau_{d}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a set of @xmath65 constitutes the equilibrium spin distribution function for a given temperature and magnetic field under the monte carlo calculation .",
    "the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 is obtained from the linear response of magnetization against the applied alternating magnetic field .",
    "@xmath12 gives the heating rate @xmath66 , and is shown for magnetite with double circles in fig.5 .",
    "it peaks around 800 k and is consistent with @xmath49 obtained with the energy principle of the monte carlo calculation .",
    "the dependence of the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 on the relaxation time @xmath67 is shown in fig.6 for the 2.5 ghz microwave .",
    "we see that @xmath12 is inversely proportional to @xmath67 in the @xmath68 range .",
    "also , the dependence of @xmath12 on the microwave frequency is shown in fig.7 for @xmath69 ns . the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility peaks around 2 ghz .",
    "this agrees with the experimentally deduced magnetic permeability for magnetite@xcite . in our calculation , the relaxation time is assumed to be constant irrespectively of temperature or microwave frequency . however , if the relaxation time becomes small with temperature rise , the heating rate increases as @xmath70 as shown in fig.5 , resulting in more rapid heating at elevated temperatures .    from these data ,",
    "one obtains the heating rate @xmath71 k / s for the case of @xmath72 ns and the microwave field @xmath73 150 g , where the heat capacity @xmath74 is 210 j / k mol at 600k ( the wave period is 400 ps for the 2.45ghz microwave ) .",
    "this is large enough to account for the experimental value @xmath75 k / s in the microwave sintering of magnetite@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the internal energy change in magnetite per wave period on the applied magnetic field is shown in fig.8 .",
    "the magnetic field amplitude ranges from 0.125 t to 1.0 t. it is well fitted by the quadratic law @xmath76 , therefore , @xmath49 thus the heating rate is proportional to the microwave power .",
    "hematite has a different crystal structure from magnetite@xcite and has weak spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the calculated change in the internal energy @xmath49 is plotted for various temperatures by triangles in fig .",
    "5 . by comparison of @xmath49 with the case of magnetite ,",
    "the response of hematite to the alternating magnetic field is considerably weak .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental fact that only the domain of magnetite in a magnetite - hematite composite powder was heated by the magnetic field of microwaves@xcite .",
    "the observation that heating of titanium oxide occurs only when oxygen defects are present@xcite , tio@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , is explained in a similar fashion .",
    "titanium in titanium oxide tio@xmath4 is a ti@xmath77 ion with @xmath78 electron configuration , which has no electrons in the 3d shell .",
    "thus , it has no spontaneous magnetization and should not respond to microwave magnetic field , similarly with hematite . however , when there are oxygen defects , the trivalent titanium ions @xmath79 appear which have @xmath80 electron configuration .",
    "the spins of these 3d electrons respond to the magnetic field of microwaves , and absorb microwave energy which leads to observed heating under the microwave magnetic field .",
    "in this paper , we have showed theoretically the mechanism of the rapid and selective sintering of magnetic metal oxide particles by the magnetic field of microwaves .",
    "we adopt the heisenberg model , and perform both monte carlo calculation and dissipative spin dynamics simulations .",
    "the heating occurs due to the response of magnetization to microwaves , which originates from electron spins residing in the unfilled 3d shell .",
    "their non - resonant response causes a large change in the internal energy through the exchange interaction between spins .",
    "it persists above the curie temperature @xmath0 because each electron spin is able to respond to the alternating magnetic field of microwaves even above @xmath0 .",
    "this energy change will then be dissipated to lattices and contribute to heating .",
    "hematite @xmath81 which has only weak spontaneous magnetization shows much less response to microwaves than magnetite .",
    "also , the heating of titanium oxide having oxygen defects tio@xmath82 ( x>0 ) by the microwave magnetic field is explained by our theory in terms of intrinsic ( spontaneous ) magnetization .",
    "the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility im@xmath83 obtained by solving dissipative spin dynamics agrees well with the heating results by the monte carlo calculation .",
    "we have also presented the dependences of the heating rate on the frequency of microwaves and on the spin relaxation time .",
    "these results well account for the large heating rate of magnetic metal oxide by the microwave magnetic field in the sintering experiments ."
