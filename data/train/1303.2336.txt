    "since the discovery of an accelerated expansion of the universe from astrophysical observations @xcite and the impossibility of explaining this acceleration with the einstein gravitational field equations of general relativity , @xmath8 , cosmologists think that , beside the standard matter there must be an unknown fluid with a _ negative pressure _",
    "@xmath9 , that drives the universe into acceleration .",
    "such a component , dubbed `` dark energy '' was completely negligible in most of the past and will entirely dominate in the future .",
    "the origin and the exact nature of dark energy are still unknown .",
    "subsequently , several interesting models have considered beside the standard matter an _ alien dynamic _",
    "dark energy component @xcite ( for further reading see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "attempting to solve geometrically the dark energy mechanism , a different approach considers the modification of the einstein gravitational field equations with models involving only the standard matter .",
    "all the additional terms in the _ modified einstein field equations _ beside the usual terms of general relativity constitute the so - called dark energy component .",
    "such a modification can arise , either by extending the einstein - hilbert action to a more fundamental theory ( @xmath10 theories of gravity constructed in _ pseudo - riemannian geometry _ ) or by modifying the riemannian geometry . in the former case",
    "the simplest @xmath11 is that contains the _ cosmological constant _",
    "@xmath12 in the form @xmath13 .",
    "the cosmological constant thus introduces a constant contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor , which then has an effective equation of state @xmath14 , leading hence to an accelerated expansion . in this framework ,",
    "the @xmath12 dark energy is well - defined and reduces to a single number equivalent to a fluid with equation of state @xmath15 .",
    "although the @xmath12 dark energy is indeed consistent with all our current cosmological data and does not introduce new degrees of freedom , it encounters , however , the fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problems by the fact that it is a non - dynamical quantum vacuum energy and its observed value is much less than the theoretical value computed from quantum field theory , @xmath16 .",
    "but several choices for @xmath17 have led to dynamic dark energy roughly compatible with observational data ( for recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , apart from @xmath18 the modifications of the gravitational field equations from @xmath19 theories include third or higher - order derivatives of metric components . furthermore , higher - order terms in curvature invariants ( such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the _ kretschmann scalar _",
    "@xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) or non - minimally coupled terms between scalar fields and geometry ( such as @xmath25 ) have to be added in an _ ad hoc way _ to the effective lagrangian of gravitational field when quantum corrections are considered .",
    "another kind of modification of the einstein gravitational field equations , mentioned above , is that constructed within lyra s geometry @xcite , particularly in the so - called _",
    "normal gauge_. lyra s geometry @xcite , like weyl s geometry @xcite , is a modified riemannian geometry proposed in order to unify gravitation and electromagnetism into a single spacetime geometry .",
    "however , in the framework of general relativity , only the connection in lyra s and riemannian geometries ( contrary to weyl s geometry ) preserves the metric and the integrability of length transfers .",
    "hence , lyra s geometry becomes the most acceptable modified riemannian geometry to describe the dynamic of the universe .",
    "indeed , theories investigated in lyra s geometry predict the same effects within observations limits , as far as the classical solar system , as well as tests based on the linearized form of the field equations and are free of the big - bang singularity . they also solve the entropy and horizon problems , which beset the standard models based on riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "the modifications based on lyra manifold are generally simpler than those built from @xmath26 theories , since they involve only first and second derivatives of metric components , and are basically due to the presence of an intrinsic geometrical _ vector field _",
    "@xmath27 ( arising from the concept of a gauge ) in the geometrically structureless manifold , without adding higher - order terms . on the other hand , the cosmological term ( _ variable _ or _ constant _ ) , introduced in an ad hoc manner into the gravitational field equations has in lyra s geometry an intrinsic geometrical origin arising from the displacement field @xcite . in addition , the scalar - tensor theories of gravitation constructed within lyra s geometry involve _ a scalar field and a tensor field that are all intrinsic to the geometry _ @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are to establish through an arbitrary function @xmath3 a connection between the hubble parameter , the displacement field and the matter energy density , and express the effective equation of state in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath28 . considering a pressureless matter we also study a possible accelerated expansion of the universe , for a time - dependent and a constant functions @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe a model , where a relationship between the hubble parameter , the displacement field and the matter energy density is established , and we also investigate the @xmath12cdm model and power - law expansion .",
    "conclusions are given in section iii .",
    "in _ planckian units _ @xmath29 , the einstein gravitational field equations in normal - gauge lyra manifold as obtained in @xcite are : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the einstein tensor ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 being ricci tensor and ricci scalar , respectively ) , @xmath34 is an intrinsic geometrical tensor associated with the displacement vector field @xmath27 , whereas @xmath35 , defined by @xmath36 is the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid with energy @xmath37 and pressure @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the vector @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , is the 4-velocity of the comoving observer .",
    "when the tensor @xmath42 vanishes , we recover the gravitational field equations of general relativity ; so the modification of the einstein s equations is solely due to the intrinsic geometrical vector field @xmath27 .    in the flat _ friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker _",
    "background @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the scale factor of an expanding universe , the nonvanishing components of the ricci tensor , and the ricci scalar are given by @xmath45 where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the time coordinate @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the hubble parameter . throughout this paper",
    "we are to consider a time - like displacement vector @xmath48 thus , the gravitational field equations ( [ h ] ) reduce to the friedmann equations @xmath49 while applying the bianchi identities we find the total energy conservation equation @xmath50 the matter energy interacts with the displacement field as the universe evolves . in @xcite",
    "an interaction was built between @xmath51 and the matter energy @xmath37 by encoding eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) into two conservation equations . here",
    ", we are to consider the first friedmann equation ( [ 2 ] ) to find the connection between @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath37 . assuming therefore the geometrical quantities @xmath52 and @xmath51 are both real , we can recast eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) in the form @xmath53 or compactly @xmath54 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two c - numbers , functions of time @xmath46 , defined by @xmath57 in terms of @xmath55 and its conjugate @xmath56 the hubble parameter and the displacement field read @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively . as for every c - number the general form of @xmath60 can be parametrized as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are two arbitrary real functions of time .",

    "( [ key ] ) and ( [ key1 ] ) , we substitute them into ( [ 2 ] ) or use straightforwardly the identity ( [ 1 ] ) ( @xmath66 ) , and we find @xmath67 . that leaves therefore @xmath3 as the only unknown function characterizing the c - number @xmath55 .",
    "observationally , the hubble parameter @xmath52 and the energy density @xmath37 are positive ; so taking @xmath68 ( from now on ) the sign of @xmath52 is determined by that of @xmath69 $ ] , and we must have @xmath69>0 $ ] whatever the sign of @xmath70 $ ] ( @xmath51 can be positive or negative ) .",
    "note also that , depending on @xmath70 $ ] , the displacement field @xmath51 could vanish yielding a decelerating expanding universe .",
    "but our goal is to explain the recent cosmic acceleration , thus we require @xmath70 \\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "moreover , combination of eqs .",

    "the matter effective equation of state @xmath76 is not the _ effective equation of state _ of the system , @xmath84 , which by contrast is defined by @xmath85 by using ( [ key ] ) and ( [ key3 ] ) knowing that @xmath68 , @xmath86 reduces to @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath88\\frac{d\\alpha(x)}{dx}.\\ ] ] which shows for @xmath89 \\ne 0 $ ] that the difference between @xmath90 and @xmath84 comes from the variation of the interaction - function . for a pressureless matter ( @xmath91 ) ,",
