    "the sdss j080434.20 + 510349.2 ( hereafter sdss0804 ) as a cataclysmic variable with underlying white dwarf was classified by szkody et al .",
    "( 2006 ) during its low ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) brightness state .",
    "the 0.0592(4 ) d orbital period was found spectroscopically .",
    "the photometry yield the two - humped profile over the orbital period and its amplitude increasing with brightness .",
    "the photometry of the sdss0804 has been carried out with different telescopes : 2.6-m shajn telescope ( ztsh ) and cassegrain 38-cm telescope of crao , 70-cm , 60-cm and 50-cm telescopes of sai , 60-cm telescope of terscol , 25-cm telescopes of vsolj .",
    "spectroscopy was done with 6-m bta telescope of sao .",
    "we present observations carried out in december , 2005 ",
    "september , 2006 .",
    "the brightness was measured relatively the comparison star tyc2 ( 3141.1011.1 ) .",
    "we started the observations of sdss0804 when it was faint ( @xmath3 ) . on march , 4 , 2006 ,",
    "we first have caught it in the outburst as the star of @xmath4 showing the superhumps with period 0.06 d and amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "following observations shown the rapid faintness up @xmath6 in a five days , so we concluded that we observed the star at the end of the superoutburst .",
    "taking into account that during the plateau of superoutburst the su uma stars typically fade on @xmath7 , one could suggest that in a top brightness sdss0804 was @xmath8 .",
    "hence the amplitude of the outburst was more or equal to @xmath0 , that is typical for the wz sge stars .",
    "soon after discovery of the outburst we observed the rapid brightness decline and series of the eleven rebrightenings .",
    "the mean amplitude of the separate rebrightening was @xmath9 and duration of 2.5 d. after the end of the rebrightenings the era of slow decay with different rate began .",
    "the outburst light curve is shown in fig.1 .",
    "note that only a few of wz sge stars also displayed the series of rebrightenings .",
    "the visual inspection of the 900 sonneberg ( 1923  2006 ) and 270 odessa ( 1968  1993 ) archive plates was done .",
    "the star was found in the outburst ( @xmath10 ) only on one plate of 1979 year from odessa collection .",
    "such rare outbursts are typical for the wz sge stars .",
    "the spectrum of the sdss0804 was obtained during one of the rebrightenings ( the date of the observations is marked by arrow in fig .",
    "1 ) in the region 4000 @xmath11  5500 @xmath11 . it displays the absorbtion lines of hidrogen .",
    "a weak @xmath12 resembles to the p - cyg profile .",
    "we constructed the periodogram for all data in the outburst after removing trends corresponded for the longer brightness variations , using the stellingwerf method ( pelt , 1992 ) .",
    "it is shown in fig . 2 ( left ) .",
    "the most prominent peak points to the superhump period of 0.059713(7 ) d. in fig . 2 ( right ) the superhump profile evolution during the cource of the outburst is shown .    prior",
    "to rebrightenings the profile has one strong hump and two dip - like structure before and after the hump ( see the left and middle panels ) at phases 0.02 and 0.40 . during rebrightenings the profile changed from cycle to cycle .    the light variations in minimum ( v band ) on jan .",
    "8 , 2006 , correspond to period 0.0586(8 ) d that fairly well coincides with orbital one .",
    "the periodogram and the data convolution are shown in fig .",
    "the mean amplitude for this night is @xmath13 and the mean profile is the two - humped one - similar to those obtained by szkody et al .",
    "note that the orbital period is also typical to the wz sge stars .",
    "for the _ v _ data in maximum ( march , 04 and march , 05 ) obtained with 10-sec time resolution we searched for the short - term light variations .",
    "the data for both nights after the superhump profile removed do display the existence of such variations : 7.8 min for 4.03 and @xmath1 9.0 min for 5.03 with amplitude @xmath14 for example the periodogram and data for 4.03 folded on the 7.8 min period are shown in fig .",
    "the source of this qpos might be the reprocessing by the accretion disk of the hot white dwarf pulsations .",
