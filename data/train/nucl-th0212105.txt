    "spayde @xcite has reexamined the data , and finds two significant corrections .",
    "the first arises from a different treatment of the electromagnetic radiative corrections , while the second is a correction for the fraction of the signal due to pions .",
    "each correction increases @xmath231 and @xmath232 by about 4 percent , resulting in quoted asymmetries of    @xmath233    [ e3.2 ]    our theoretical results for the one quark contributions given in table  [ table4 ] need to be supplemented by the many quark contributions .",
    "these have been evaluated using chiral perturbation theory by zhu _",
    "@xcite , who found small , predominantly isovector , contributions .",
    "their isovector contribution can be parameterized as @xmath234 , while the isoscalar is @xmath235 .",

    "our error analysis for the theoretical asymmetry takes into account uncertainties in the measured electromagnetic form factors , in the axial contributions @xmath61 and @xmath64 , and in the radiative corrections .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in the one quark radiative corrections is in the soft photon approximation for the bremsstrahlung contributions .",
    "we have allowed for a rather generous error estimate by evaluating these corrections for @xmath236  mev , which is half the value used in table  [ table4 ] .    our theoretical asymmetry for the sample kinematics , including all radiative corrections , and adding errors in quadrature , can be written to show the explicit dependence on the strange form factors :    @xmath237    for no strange quark contribution , the measured asymmetries are smaller than the theoretical ones .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values for @xmath231 and @xmath232 are about the same , whereas the coefficients of the dominant @xmath238 term are considerably different .    in our analysis",
    "we have used the recent nucleon electromagnetic form factors determined by brash _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . at @xmath227",
    "gev , these nucleon form factors tend to be smaller than in the galster parameterization , thereby exacerbating the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental values noted in previous work @xcite .",
    "the axial form factors are taken to be a simple dipole form , following refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contribution from @xmath239 for these kinematic is expected to be small . for the range of values of the strange radius @xmath240 found in the literature",
    ", we expect @xmath241 to be in the range @xmath242 . for comparison ,",
    "the neutron electric form factor has the value @xmath243 .",
    "happex @xcite has measured the asymmetry @xmath231 at @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "they find the linear combination @xmath246 , which would seem to favor a positive value of @xmath239 .",
    "a measurement at @xmath227 is underway , and could shed some light on the sample result .    because the largest overall uncertainty in the theoretical calculations is from @xmath210 , it is useful to follow the analysis of the sample papers @xcite and isolate this term explicitly . in this case",
    ", we have    @xmath247    [ e3.3 ]    we have dropped the @xmath239 terms , and have added ( in quadrature ) an additional uncertainty @xmath248 to @xmath231 and @xmath249 to @xmath232 .",
    "the isoscalar terms in @xmath32 , shown in eq .",
    "( [ e2.6 ] ) have been absorbed into the constant term .",
    "the axial isovector contribution is @xmath250 which has the theoretically expected value @xmath251 .",
    "this includes the large effect of the one quark axial correction ( @xmath252 ) , and the highly uncertain many quark contribution ( @xmath234 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because the coefficients of @xmath253 in eqs .",
    "( [ e3.3 ] ) are roughly equal , changes in @xmath253 will shift @xmath231 and @xmath232 by about the same amount .",
    "this is consistent with the uniform discrepancy between theory and experiment in @xmath231 and @xmath232 referred to above , and so it is useful to try to fit the data in this way .",
    "however , there may be other explanations for such a uniform discrepancy , including other physics , or systematic errors in the experimental analysis of the kind determined by spayde @xcite .",
    "hence we regard this as simply a device for characterizing the data , and indicating possible directions for explanation .    solving the pair of equations ( [ e3.3 ] ) for @xmath238 and @xmath253 , and using the measured asymmetries from eq .",
    "( [ e3.2 ] ) , we find    @xmath254    combining the errors in the extracted value of @xmath32 and the theoretical value quoted above , the difference is about 1 @xmath255 .    there is some uncertainty about how to extrapolate @xmath256 to @xmath257",
    ". a simple dipole form consistent with the proton and neutron magnetic electromagnetic form factors would give @xmath258 .",

    "@xcite , one instead finds a value of the strange magnetic moment @xmath259 , here the last value of the error was introduced in the extrapolation .",
    "a negative value of @xmath55 is consistent with expectations from a number of theoretical models @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent lattice qcd calculations find @xmath260 @xcite and @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , a recent su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model gives @xmath262 to @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the above analysis for the sample  ii kinematics ( @xmath264  mev ) . this experiment is currently being analyzed .",
    "we find    @xmath265    with the theoretically expected value @xmath266 .",
    "the overall asymmetries are smaller , and the uncertainties enter somewhat differently than in the sample  i kinematics .",
    "this should help in determining the role of @xmath253 in the asymmetries .",
    "we have reexamined the one - loop radiative corrections to the one - quark amplitudes in the cdr scheme .",
    "our calculations include an evaluation of bremsstrahlung corrections in the soft photon approximation .",
    "the bremsstrahlung corrections cancel infrared divergences in the one - loop diagrams .",
    "the soft photon approximation has a logarithmic dependence on detection threshold .",
    "the sensitivity to this parameter will be reduced if hard bremsstrahlung photons are included , but that requires knowledge of the particular experimental setup .",
    "although we find that @xmath253 is highly suppressed , there is no indication from the present calculation that it is suppressed by the magnitude indicated by the sample analysis .",
    "a contribution from the isosinglet strange axial form factor @xmath64 is unlikely to resolve the problem , as we find it is highly suppressed by the isosinglet radiative corrections @xmath267 .",
    "the many quark corrections calculated by zhu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were numerically small , but given the large uncertainties , this is one avenue for further theoretical work .",
    "further experimental measurements by the happex collaboration at @xmath227  gev@xmath228 , as well as a new measurement by the sample group at the smaller electron energy 120 mev , should also shed light on this situation .",
