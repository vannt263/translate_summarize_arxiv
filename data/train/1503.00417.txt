    "as a possible approach to the functional integral with complex measure , such as the one encountered in the finite density qcd  @xcite , the complex langevin method  @xcite has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "this recent interest was triggered mainly by the discovery of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the method to a correct answer  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite is a review on recent developments . roughly speaking , if the probability distribution of configurations generated by the langevin dynamics damps sufficiently fast at infinity of configuration space , the statistical average over the configurations is shown to be identical to the integration over the original complex measure .",
    "it has been observed that , in systems for which the complex langevin ( cl ) method converges to a wrong answer ( such as the three - dimensional xy model  @xcite ) , this requirement of a sufficiently localized distribution is broken , typically in `` imaginary directions '' in configuration space .",
    "after the above understanding , a prescription in lattice gauge theory that makes the probability distribution well localized was proposed in  ref .",
    "@xcite ; the prescription is termed `` gauge cooling '' and it proceeds as follows : the link variables in lattice gauge theory are originally elements of the compact gauge group  @xmath1 . when the ( effective ) action is complex , however , the corresponding langevin evolution drives link variables into imaginary directions and link variables become elements of  @xmath2 , a _ noncompact _ gauge group .",
    "this evolution tends to make the distribution wide in noncompact directions ; in terms of the @xmath1 lie algebra , those noncompact directions are parametrized by imaginary coordinates . at this point ,",
    "one notes that the definition of a physical observable that is invariant under the original @xmath1 gauge transformations can always be tailored so that it is invariant also under the noncompact @xmath2 gauge transformations .",
    "the idea of the gauge cooling is that by applying the @xmath2 gauge transformations appropriately along the complex langevin evolution , one squeezes the distribution well localized so that the prerequisite of the convergence theorem  @xcite is fulfilled without changing physical observables .    in a one - dimensional gauge model and in the four - dimensional qcd with heavy quarks",
    ", it has been confirmed that the gauge cooling makes the distribution well localized and the complex langevin method gives rise to correct answers  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this method was applied to the full qcd at finite density  @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "one should note , however , that the langevin dynamics itself is defined on gauge noninvariant variables ( i.e. , link variables ) and also that the gauge cooling step can not be regarded as a langevin evolution that is induced by a _",
    "action ; the latter is assumed in the convergence theorem  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , therefore , the convergence theorem does not apply when the gauge cooling is employed .",
    "the method should still be carefully examined in various possible ways .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply the complex langevin method in conjunction with the gauge cooling to the two - dimensional lattice yang - mills theory which can be analytically solved  @xcite . by doing this ,",
    "we examine the validity of the method .",
    "the partition function of the two - dimensional yang - mills theory on the lattice is given by @xmath3     \\mathrm{e}^{-s } , \\label{eq:(1.1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are link variables defined on a two - dimensional rectangular lattice , @xmath5 is the lattice action , . ] @xmath6 , \\label{eq:(1.2)}\\ ] ] and the plaquette variable is defined by @xmath7    for simplicity , we assume that the gauge group is  @xmath0 , that is , @xmath8 in the original integral  . on the other hand ,",
    "when the gauge coupling  @xmath9 is complex , the corresponding langevin equation [ eq .   below ] evolves link variables as elements of  @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the distinction between @xmath11 and  @xmath12 becomes very important in the complex langevin dynamics .",
    "for the convergence theorem in  refs .",
    "@xcite to apply , the action  @xmath5 that generates the drift force in the langevin equation and physical observables must be a holomorphic function of dynamical variables ; our above definitions   that entirely use @xmath12 not  @xmath11 are chosen by this criterion .",
    "note also that the plaquette action   is invariant under the @xmath10 lattice gauge transformations [ such as the one in  eq .  ] .",
    "we consider the expectation value of the plaquette variable : @xmath13\\right\\rangle     = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{z } }     \\int\\left[\\prod_{x,\\mu}\\mathrm{d}u_{x,\\mu}\\right ]     \\mathrm{e}^{-s }     \\operatorname{tr}\\left[u_{01}(x)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:(1.4)}\\ ] ] even if the gauge coupling  @xmath9 is complex , this can be exactly computed by the character expansion  @xcite . under periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "one yields @xmath13\\right\\rangle     = -\\frac{n}{v}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}\\ln\\mathcal{z},\\qquad     \\mathcal{z}=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left[\\frac{2}{\\beta}i_n(\\beta)\\right]^v , \\label{eq:(1.5)}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind and @xmath15  is the number of lattice points .",
    "the following procedures are basically identical to the ones adopted for the four - dimensional lattice qcd in  ref .",
    "@xcite for example , although our two - dimensional pure - gauge system is much simpler .    for the link variable ,",
    "the langevin equation with a discretized langevin time  @xmath16 with the time step  @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18u_{x,\\mu}(t ) , \\label{eq:(2.1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) are pauli matrices , @xmath23 are gaussian real random numbers of the variant @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the drift force generated by the action  @xmath5 in  eq .  ; the derivative with respect to the link variable is given by @xmath26 when the gauge coupling  @xmath9 is complex , the drift force becomes complex and the langevin evolution evolves link variables as elements of  @xmath10 .    the above complex langevin dynamics tends to make the probability distribution function of link variables wide in noncompact directions of  @xmath10 . to squeeze the distribution well localized without changing gauge invariant quantities",
    ", we apply the following @xmath10 gauge transformation ( this step is the gauge cooling ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 , \\label{eq:(2.5)}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 is a real parameter .",
    "the distance defined by  @xcite @xmath30 measures how a @xmath10 gauge field is far away from the subspace of @xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that for a sufficiently small  @xmath17 , the gauge cooling   decreases or does not change the distance  @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 in  eq .",
    "is not a holomorphic function of link variables and thus the step   can not be regarded as a part of the complex langevin dynamics in which the drift force is generated by a holomorphic action ; this fact prevents us from applying the convergence theorem  @xcite to the above procedures .",
    "we numerically solved the langevin equation with the discretized langevin time , eq .  , on a @xmath33 lattice .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the maximal size of the time step  @xmath17 we adopted was  @xmath34 and , when the drift force becomes large , we further reduced @xmath17 `` adaptively '' according to the prescription in  ref .",
    "@xcite .    as the parameter  @xmath35 in the gauge cooling  , we tried both @xmath36 and the adaptive choice ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37 our numerical results did not show any notable difference in these two choices and we present the results with the latter choice in what follows .    to determine an appropriate rate of the gauge cooling   along the langevin evolution",
    ", we observed the time evolution of the distance  @xmath31   by changing the number of the gauge cooling steps per one langevin update  . in  fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , for  @xmath38 , we plotted the evolution of the distance  @xmath31 as the function of the langevin time  @xmath16 by changing the number of the gauge cooling steps per one langevin update as , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and  @xmath41 .",
    "such that it does not elapse during the gauge cooling steps .",
    "] since this plot shows the evolution including the langevin stochastic dynamics , the distance  @xmath31 does not necessarily decrease .     for  @xmath38 with various numbers of the gauge cooling steps per one langevin update  , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and  @xmath41 .",

    "it appears that the gauge cooling is working perfectly for those complex gauge couplings , suppressing the evolution to noncompact imaginary directions .",
