    "the mid - infrared spectrum ( mir , @xmath63 - 40@xmath7 m ) hosts a range of important diagnostic fine - structure emission lines . due to the much lower dust opacity at these long wavelengths ,",
    "the emission lines are significantly less affected by extinction than ultraviolet or optical lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus these lines are able to probe ionized regions that lie behind dense obscuring clouds or even deep within galaxy centers , giving insights into the regions where massive star formation events actually occur , or heavily obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can exist .",
    "one of the more useful facets of this wavelength regime is that it includes emission lines from several ions of the same species , in particular strong lines from neon and sulphur .",
    "these lines can be used as strong diagnostics of the ionization state of the emitting gas as , being from the same species , there is no direct dependence on the gas phase abundances , and the different ionization potentials allow the observer to trace the hardness of the ionizing spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lines ratios such as [ nev]@xmath8/[neii]@xmath1 , [ neiii]@xmath0/[neii]@xmath1 , and [ siv]@xmath2/[siii]@xmath3 have been used to diagnose the presence of deeply buried agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as indicators of the ages of starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major drawback of the mir emission lines as diagnostics is their accessibility , with the full range of lines only available to spectrographs aboard space - borne telescopes like the _ short wavelength spectrograph _ ( sws , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( iso , * ? ? ? * ) and the _ infrared spectrograph _ ( irs , * ? ? ? * ) aboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "while mir instruments on ground based telescopes can provide higher spatial and spectral resolution , only a sparse number of mir bands are available due to the opaqueness of the earth s atmosphere in the mid - infrared ( m - band:@xmath9 - 5@xmath10 , n - band:@xmath11 - 13@xmath10 , and q - band:@xmath12 - 23@xmath10 ) . as a result ,",
    "the [ neiii]@xmath0 line is inaccessible from the ground and therefore recent high - resolution studies have resorted to the ratio [ siv]@xmath2/[neii]@xmath1 as a diagnostic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in a similar manner to earlier aircraft - borne ir telescope studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however the question remains whether the use of this ratio as a proxy for the ionization sensitive [ neiii]@xmath0/[neii]@xmath1 ratio is justified . while photoionization theory clearly indicates that there will be a correlation between these ratios , the dependence of the line emission on",
    "often unknown physical parameters make the accuracy of this correlation uncertain . as an example , the [ siv]/[neii ] ratio is directly proportional to the sulfur to neon abundance ratio , while the [ neiii]/[neii ] will be almost unaffected by any changes in the relative abundances .",
    "similarly , with an excitation potential of 34.79 ev , [ siii ] is sensitive to lower energy photons than [ neiii ] , which has an excitation potential of 40.96ev and will not exist in photoionized gas when there are no photons above this limit .    in this letter",
    "we use archival iso and _ spitzer _ observations of a range of astrophysical objects to demonstrate that such a correlation does exist and derive a simple conversion law for these ratios .",
    "we mention possible systematics with the determination of these ratios and discuss the origin of the observed correlation . as a final note",
    "we recommend the application of these results in future ( ground - based ) observations .",
    "the strong , diagnostic , mir emission lines [ siv]@xmath2 , [ neii]@xmath1 , [ neiii]@xmath0 , and [ siii]@xmath3 have been detected and characterised in a broad range of astrophysical objects , from nearby galactic hii  regions to ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) . to determine the connection between the [ siv]/[neii ] and [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios",
    "we have extracted from the recent literature the fluxes of these four emission lines . while not exhaustive , the sample of 355 emission line objects is representative of the range of sources from which these lines arise , covering a range of physical parameters , such as source morphology and geometry , nature of the ionizing sources and metal and dust abundances .",
    ".publications from which we sourced our mir emission lines differentiated the object classes , along with the telescope used and the mean fractional error in the [ neii]@xmath1 line .",
    "[ tab : sources ] [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first thing to note is that the log - space linear fit to the full sample appears to be accurate to 0.25 dex ( that is , less than a factor of @xmath62 in the linear ratio ) over four orders of magnitude in the line ratios , demonstrating clearly the ability of ground - based ir spectrographs to do ionization studies of nebulae .",
    "the dispersion around this relation is greater than the average uncertainty , indicating either inaccurate uncertainties , intrinsic variations due to the variety of sources or , most likely , a combination of both .",
    "in addition to the full fit we also present fits to our various object classes , also presented in table [ tab : fits ] .",
    "overall , the relations match reasonably well with the full sample fit , with the two major outliers either side being the planetary nebulae ( high offset in @xmath13 ) and the ulirgs ( shallow slope in @xmath14 ) .",
    "these individual fits can be used when the specific class of objects being observed are known , but we suggest that the full fit should be used in most circumstances , as it is a more robust fit and includes all object classes .    in figure",
    "[ fig : obsdata]b the pne are visibly offset from the rest of the sample , both to high [ siv]/[neii ] and higher than average [ neiii]/[neii ] .",
    "this offset is most likely due to",
    "the hotter and harder white dwarf ionizing source in pne , although this then poses the question why the agn , which also have a harder ionizing spectrum than that found in hii  regions and galaxies , is not also more offset .",
    "the shallow slope of the ulirg sample demonstrates one of the issues with the [ siv]/[neii ] ratio : the location of the [ siv]@xmath2 in the @xmath15 silicate absorption feature . of the @xcite sample of 53 ulirgs over half",
    "have no detections or upper limits for the [ siv ] line , while a large fraction of those which do have detections are uncertain , with detections of less than 3 sigma . as noted in the paper , only in ulirgs with low silicate depths ( @xmath16 ) is the [ siv ] feature detected , even when the [ neiii]@xmath0 line is present .",
    "thus there is likely both a bias in our ulirg sample and an offset , such that low [ siv]/[neii ] ulirgs are also those with high extinction and therefore offset from the relation , while the highest extinction sources are not included at all ..    another spectral feature which may affect the line ratio relation is the 12.7@xmath10  pah feature seen clearly in many galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "this broad feature lies below the [ neii ] line , and makes the determination and subtraction of the underlying continuum difficult , and thus increases the uncertainty in the flux of this line . as mentioned before",
    ", this may explain the offset seen in the @xcite sample",
    ".    however , even with these outliers the correlation is surprisingly tight .",
    "simple photoionization theory expects such a correlation , with higher ionization leading to higher values for both ratios @xcite , but variations in the ionization parameter , where @xmath17 and ionizing spectrum cause different changes in the two ratios .",
    "such variations have been explored in the case of starbursts and hii  regions in @xcite and @xcite and , given these results , the tight fit indicates a close correlation between ionization parameter and spectral hardness in these objects .",
    "one further issue is abundance variations .",
    "the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is sensitive to abundance variations only indirectly , through the resulting temperature effects .",
    "the [ siv]/[neii ] ratio however , can be directly affected by variations between the sulphur and neon abundances .",
    "as both are primary elements , significant total abundance variations are not expected . however , depletion of sulphur onto dust may cause variations in the gas phase and hence in the emission lines . while the total depletion of sulphur onto dust is uncertain ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it does not seem to be a great effect on the ne / s ratio , as shown by @xcite , and therefore on the [ siv]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "thus , in summary , to determine whether it is reasonable to use the ground - accessible ratio [ siv]@xmath2/[neii]@xmath1 as a replacement for the diagnostic [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , we have collated existing iso and _ spitzer _ spectral observations of a wide range of astrophysical objects from the literature . we find a good correlation between these ratios with a linear fit giving the relation , @xmath18/[\\rm{neii}]\\right ) = 0.81\\log\\left([\\rm{siv}]/[\\rm{neii}]\\right)+0.36,\\ ] ] with a 1 @xmath19 dispersion of 0.25 , corresponding to an uncertainty in the estimated line ratio of @xmath20% .",
    "we propose that for future ground based observations this relationship be used to determine the ionization state of the observed objects , though note that caution must be applied when looking at heavily extinguished ( @xmath21 ) objects where the [ siv]@xmath2 may be affected by the 9.7@xmath10  silicate absorption feature .",
