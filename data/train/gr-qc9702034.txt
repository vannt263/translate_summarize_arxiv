    "the notion of gauge symmetry is one of the cornerstones of theoretical physics .",
    "this is known to anybody who ever got in touch with the basics of modern quantum field theory .",
    "the three non  gravitational interactions are completely described by means of gauge theories in the framework of the standard model .",
    "predictions of the standard model are experimentally verified with very good accuracy .",
    "thus the concept of gauge symmetry should be contained in any future generalization of the standard model .",
    "at least after the pioneering works of utiyama @xcite , sciama @xcite , and kibble @xcite , it was recognized that also gravitation can be formulated as a gauge theory . in this case , the relevant gauge symmetry is represented by the symmetry of spacetime itself .",
    "however , the hope that the formulation of gravity as a gauge theory could lead to a consistent quantum theory of gravity has not been fulfilled yet .",
    "also the inclusion of supersymmetric gauge symmetries ( `` supergravity '' @xcite ) and fundamental string - like objects ( `` string theories '' @xcite ) has not changed this drastically .    this article is a self  contained introduction into the metric  affine gauge theory of gravity .",
    "the metric  affine ( gauge theory of ) gravity ( mag ) is based on the assumption that affine transformations are gauge ( symmetry ) transformations of spacetime .",
    "it constitutes a general example of the gauging of an external symmetry group .",
    "the material presented is not completely original .",
    "a recent review of metric  affine gravity with an exhaustive reference list is already available @xcite .",
    "this article is claimed to be original in its kind of presentation of this subject : starting from the independence of physical results of the choice of affine reference frames ( to be defined below ) , we will develop the metric  affine theory from scratch .",
    "this is done in close analogy to the more familiar yang  mills theory . in our approach",
    "we try to elaborate on the idea behind the gauge procedure .",
    "this idea is essential for any gauge approach to gravity .",
    "it is hoped that this article makes the gauge framework of gravity accessible to everybody who wants to get started in this field .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows : in sec.1 we explain our view of what ingredients are the ones that define a gauge theory .",
    "this view is illustrated by the example of @xmath0-yang mills theory . in the same spirit",
    ", a gauging of the affine group is pursued in sec.2 .",
    "then the emerging structures are embedded into the general framework of a classical field theory in sec.3 . in sec.4",
    "it is shown how to obtain general relativity as a special case from restricting mag to a translational gauge theory .",
    "more general applications of mag are left to a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variables of a physical theory are usually expressed with respect to some reference frame .",
    "dynamical variables describe gauge systems , if there is some freedom in choosing a reference frame .",
    "this freedom is expressed by the possibility to transform a given reference frame into an _ equivalent _ one .",
    "such a transformation is called a _",
    "gauge transformation_. here , the equivalence of reference frames is defined by the _ symmetry _ of the physical theory : equivalent reference frames are those which are connected by a symmetry transformation .",
    "the symmetry , in turn , is either postulated or deduced on empirical grounds , from the existence of corresponding conserved currents , e.g ..    quite generally , we expect a change of the explicit form of the dynamical variables if we change the reference frame .",
    "the physically meaningful variables , i.e. the observables , are those which are independent of the reference frame . these variables are called gauge invariant , since they are invariant under any gauge transformation .",
    "gauge transformations are often realized by means of transformations of a lie group .",
    "this group , the gauge or _",
    "local _ symmetry group , acts in an appropriate representation on the reference frame , inducing the gauge transformations of the dynamical variables .    as a rule ,",
    "it is not possible to formulate a gauge theory in terms of gauge invariant variables right from the beginning .",
    "therefore , dealing with gauge theories means dealing with unphysical degrees of freedom , since the freedom of choosing an arbitrary frame should be of no physical relevance . the task is to extract physically meaningful quantities from this , a difficulty which is present at both the classical and the quantum level",
    ".    but the gauge principle of choosing an arbitrary reference frame is not just a mathematical nuisance , it also exhibits physical beauty since it leads in a natural way to the introduction of gauge field potentials ( = gauge connections ) which mediate the interaction between matter .",
    "gauge potentials are essential means for describing a reference frame .",
    "thus they are as fundamental as the notion `` reference frame '' itself .    to put the arbitrariness of a reference frame at the basis of a gauge theory , as it will be done here , seems to be less familiar than the common definition of a gauge theory in terms of fibre bundle language , see @xcite , e.g ..   there",
    ", the gauge connection is viewed as the basic ingredient .",
    "the fact that the arbitrariness of a reference frame comes before the definition of a gauge connection may seem trivial . to understand the relationship between both approaches ,",
    "it is sufficient to understand the basic definition of a linear connection , as explained in @xcite , for example . in the following",
    ", the knowledge required is reformulated , adapted , and explained in view of a smooth introduction into metric ",
    "affine gravity .    to begin with",
    ", we will expound these introductory remarks in the next subsection by reviewing @xmath0-yang - mills theory ( ym@xmath1 ) , probably the most prominent gauge theory .",
    "from this we will move on and develop , in close analogy , the gauging of the affine group @xmath2 , yielding the metric  affine theory of gravity .",
    "the gauging of the unitary groups @xmath0 is of fundamental importance in elementary particle physics .",
    "the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions relies on the gauging of @xmath3 , its simplest `` grand unification '' is described by the gauging of @xmath4 . for a compact introduction into ym@xmath1",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , chap.8 .    as the basic dynamical field variable",
    "we take a multiplet field @xmath5 with complex components @xmath6 . by splitting @xmath7 in this way into @xmath8 components",
    ", we have already assumed some reference frame @xmath9 within an @xmath8-dimensional complex representation space of @xmath7 : @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath0-matrices act in this representation space as linear transformations .",
    "ym@xmath1 presupposes @xmath0-transformations as gauge transformations .",
    "that is , any frame @xmath11 emerging from @xmath9 by an @xmath0-transformation yields an equivalent reference frame for expressing @xmath7 in @xmath8 components .",
    "the @xmath0-transformations can be generated by @xmath12 traceless hermitian @xmath13 matrices .",
    "we write the @xmath0-transformations in the form @xmath14 with the @xmath15 @xmath0-group generators and @xmath16 the corresponding group parameters , see tab.[table0a ] for the cases @xmath17 .",
    "the postulate of local lorentz invariance leads to a solution for the constant and real parameters @xmath19 in the following way : infinitesimal lorentz rotations are expressed by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the antisymmetric lorentz group parameters .",
    "it is easy to check that the gauge lagrangian @xmath22 , with @xmath23 given by ( [ hdef ] ) , is invariant under _ rigid _ lorentz rotations , @xmath24 .",
    "the general expression for @xmath25 reads v= ( v+d v)^-d ( v^ ) .",
    "[ vvar ] hence we have @xmath24 for rigid lorentz rotations .",
    "however , for _ local _ lorentz rotations with spacetime - dependent group parameters @xmath26 , we find from ( [ vvar ] ) the offending term as _",
    "( local)v =- d^_^. in order to achieve local lorentz invariance , this term has to vanish , modulo an exact form . using the leibniz rule , we obtain d^_^= - ^ _ d ( v^ ) + d(^ _",
    "v^ ) . the second term on the r.h.s .  is already exact . from the first term we get as condition for local lorentz invariance of @xmath27 _ [ _ ] = exact .",
    "we plug in the explicit expression for @xmath27 and obtain , after some algebra , 2l^2 v_[_]&=&(1 3a_1 - 13 a_3)d_-(2",

    "then we obtain 2l^2 v_[_]=a_1 2d_. the constant @xmath28 can be absorbed by a suitable choice of the coupling constant @xmath29 in @xmath27 , see ( [ hdef ] ) . according to the usual conventions , we put @xmath30 , i.e.  @xmath27 is locally lorentz invariant for parameters a_1=-1,a_2=2,a_3=12 . thus v_||=12",

    "= v_||+l _ mat(,d,^ ) .",
    "it is locally lorentz invariant only if @xmath31 transforms covariantly under the lorentz group .",
    "this happens for _ scalar _ fields or _ gauge _ fields like the maxwell field  and is a further assumption to be made in order to avoid a gauging of the lorentz group .",
    "the field equation @xmath32 becomes dh_-e_=_,[fieldeq ] where , as before , @xmath33 denotes the material canonical energy - momentum current and e_&= & ( e_d^)h_-1 2e_(d^h _ ) + & = & 1 2 the energy - momentum current of the gauge field .",
    "if the lagrangian ( [ vinv ] ) is substituted into the field equation ( [ fieldeq ] ) , it can be seen that the antisymmetric part of the left hand side of ( [ fieldeq ] ) vanishes , _ [ d h_]-_[e_]=0 .[antisym ] therefore the right hand side has to be symmetric , too .",
    "again , we recognize that only scalar matter fields or gauge fields , such as the electromagnetic field , are allowed as material sources , whereas matter carrying spin can not be consistently coupled in such a framework .",
    "the object of anholonomy @xmath34 describes a riemannian geometry of spacetime .",
    "the corresponding levi - civita ( or christoffel ) connection @xmath35 , referring to the metric @xmath36 , cf.([ometric ] ) , can be derived from cartan s ( first ) structure equation d^= -_^^. [ cartan ] solving ( [ cartan ] ) for @xmath37 yields _ = 12 ( e_d_-e _ d_- ( e_e_d_)^ ) .",

    "does nt all this look like general relativity ?",
