    "observations of neutrino oscillations at the mass splittings ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are consistent with three generations of neutrinos and a unitary mixing matrix  @xcite . however , the lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite experiments observe an excess of @xmath6 events from a @xmath7 beam , indicating possible new physics with @xmath1 @xmath8 .",
    "this could be explained by introducing additional generations of light neutrinos , and electroweak data  @xcite require such additional light neutrino species to be sterile , i.e. with negligible couplings to @xmath9 and z bosons .",

    "the miniboone collaboration has previously reported limits on @xmath10 and @xmath7 disappearance in this region of @xmath1  @xcite . substantial neutrino flux and interaction cross section uncertainties limited the sensitivity of the miniboone only analyses .",

    "the muon neutrino beam , with mean energy of 0.8  gev , interacts in the sciboone ( miniboone ) detectors at 100  m ( 541  m ) from the neutrino production target .",
    "neutrino disappearance at these distances would be observable as a distortion in the neutrino energy spectrum and as a deficit of the total event rate . at @xmath1 of @xmath15",

    "the bnb neutrino flux  @xcite is simulated using geant4  @xcite and includes updated p - be particle production data  @xcite .",
    "the sciboone experimental hall houses three sub - detectors ; in order from upstream to downstream they are a fully active and finely segmented scintillator tracker ( scibar ) , an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ec ) , and a muon range detector ( mrd ) . the scibar detector  @xcite consists of 14,336 extruded polystyrene ( @xmath18 ) strips .",
    "the scintillators are arranged vertically and horizontally to construct a 3 @xmath19 3 @xmath19 1.7  m@xmath20 volume with a total mass of 15 tons which serves as the primary neutrino interaction target for sciboone .",

    "the ec is a `` spaghetti''-type calorimeter ; 64 modules made of 1  mm scintillating fibers embedded in lead foil are bundled in 64 modules and read out at both ends by pmts . the mrd is built from 12 iron plates , each 5  cm thick , sandwiched between planes of 6  mm thick scintillation counters ; there are 13 alternating horizontal and vertical planes read out via 362 individual 2  inch pmts . a geant4  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation",

    "neutrino interactions are simulated with the v3 nuance event generator  @xcite , with cross section parameters set to match miniboone and sciboone data  @xcite .",
    "prior to selection , approximately 44% ( 39% ) of all events in sciboone ( miniboone ) are due to charged current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) scattering and 25% ( 29% ) to charged current single pion production ( cc@xmath21 ) ; the small difference in event fractions in miniboone and sciboone is due to the somewhat higher energy flux at miniboone .",

    "we estimate the selection cuts for the mrd - stopped sample are 18% efficient for all cc interactions , with 90% cc neutrino interaction purity ; the main sources of inefficiency stem from the detector volume acceptance and the momentum requirement that the events be contained in scibar or the mrd , or exit through the last plane of the mrd .",
