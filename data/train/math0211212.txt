    ", we want to describe strata of the stratification of @xmath3 as well as leaves of the singular foliation directly in terms of the reduced poisson algebra @xmath4 .",
    "the essential property of a smooth stratified space needed here is the fact that it is a smooth subcartesian space .",
    "the notion of a subcartesian space was introduced by aronszajn , @xcite , and subsequently developed by aronszajn and szeptycki , @xcite , @xcite , and by marshall , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "related notions were independently introduced and studied by spallek , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a smooth subcartesian space is a diffferential space in the sense of sikorski , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that is locally diffeomorphic to a subset of a cartesian space @xmath6 hence , we can use the differential space approach and study properties of a subcartesian space in terms of its ring of globally defined smooth functions .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize to smooth subcartesian spaces the theorem of sussmann on orbits of families of vector fields on manifolds , @xcite , and investigate its applications . in order to do this",

    "a stratified space @xmath3 is locally trivial if it is locally diffeomorphic to the product of a stratified space and a cone , @xcite .",
    "we introduce the notion of a strongly stratified vector field on a startified space , and prove that the family of all strongly stratified vector fields on a locally trivial stratified space @xmath3 is locally complete and that its orbits are strata of @xmath36 . hence , each stratum of @xmath3 is contained in an orbit of the family @xmath30 of all vector fields on @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , we show that if @xmath3 is a locally trivial stratified space then orbits of the family @xmath30 of all vector fields on @xmath3 also give rise to a stratification of @xmath37 if the original stratification of @xmath3 is minimal , then it coincides with the stratification by orbits of @xmath38 .",
    "these results on stratified spaces are applied to describe singular poisson reduction of hamiltonian systems .",
    "we discuss also subcartesian poisson spaces and almost complex spaces .",
