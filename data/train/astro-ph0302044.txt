    "they have been used , extensively , to derive information on the dust - obscured star - formation rate , dust content , and metallicity in the early universe @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of nearby ulirgs , and more particularly , determining whether they are powered by starbursts or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , or both , is of great importance in modern extragalactic astronomy .",
    "spectroscopic observation of the thermal infrared wavelength range ( 320 @xmath0 m ) is currently one of the most powerful methods of determining the energy sources of ulirgs . at this wavelength range ,",
    "dust extinction is lower than at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath42 @xmath0 m ) , so it becomes possible to detect and measure the emission from more highly obscured energy sources , with smaller uncertainty in dust extinction corrections .",
    "in addition , spectral features in this waveband can be used to distinguish between starburst and agn activity .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission is detected in starbursts but not in agns , making it a good indicator of starburst activity @xcite , while the presence of agns hidden behind dust can be recognized through absorption features .",
    "pah emission and absorption features , detected in ground - based slit spectra ( e.g. , dudley 1999 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ; soifer et al .",
    "2002 ) and in _ iso _ spectra taken with large apertures ( e.g. , tran et al . 2001 ) , have been utilized to investigate the energy sources of ulirgs .    in ulirgs",
    ", there are two potentially energetically significant components .",
    "one is a weakly obscured ( a@xmath5 @xmath6 20 mag)m is insignificant , which is roughly the criterion that a@xmath7 @xmath6 1 mag , or a@xmath5 @xmath6 20 mag if the galactic extinction curve of @xmath8 @xcite is adopted . ]",
    "starburst in the extended ( kpc scale ) host galaxy and also at the nucleus .",
    "the other is a nuclear , compact ( less than a few hundred pc in size ) , highly obscured energy source , powered by an agn and/or a compact starburst .",
    "recent ground - based high spatial resolution imaging observations @xcite have shown that the weakly obscured ( @xmath9 mag ) starbursts are energetically insignificant , and that the nuclear , compact , highly obscured energy sources dominate in ulirgs @xcite . however , the nature of these nuclear sources is not easy to determine , because dust extinction can be significant even in the thermal infrared wavelength range .",
    "the observed pah - to - infrared luminosity ratios in ulirgs have been found to be smaller than in known starburst galaxies by a large factor @xcite .",
    "assuming that the luminosities of the pah emission are a good indicator of the absolute magnitudes of starbursts , the smaller ratios in ulirgs could be due either to an increase in the dust extinction of the pah emission , or a dominant contribution from agns to the infrared luminosities of ulirgs . determining which explanation is correct requires reliable estimates of the dust extinction toward the starbursts in ulirgs .",
    "however , these estimates become complicated if the assumption of a `` foreground screen '' dust geometry is not valid for the starbursts @xcite .    to understand the nature of the compact ,",
    "highly obscured energy sources in ulirgs , the spectral shapes of the nuclear compact emission can provide more insight than just the absolute luminosities of pah emission , because the equivalent widths of pah emission are , by definition , robust to the amount of dust extinction .",
    "if the nuclear compact emission of ulirgs displayed significantly lower equivalent widths of pah emission than typically seen in starburst galaxies , and , in addition , strong absorption features were detected , it would suggest that energetically important dust - obscured agns were present . since the attenuation of the extended , weakly obscured emission is much smaller than that of the emission from the compact , highly obscured energy sources , the observed 320 @xmath0 m spectra taken with large apertures can be strongly contaminated by the extended emission , even though the total infrared ( 81000 @xmath0 m ) luminosities of ulirgs are dominated by the compact energy sources . in this case",
    ", the signatures of absorption features toward the compact energy sources can be diluted .",
    "hence spectroscopy with a narrow ( less than a few arcsec ) slit  comparable to the spatial extent of the compact component  is better suited to probe the nature of the compact energy sources in ulirgs .",
    "ground - based slit spectroscopy in the @xmath10-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath0 m ) has several important advantages for investigating the nature of dust - enshrouded agns :    1 .",
    "the dust extinction curve is fairly grey ( wavelength - independent ) at 310 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "2 .   the dust around an agn has a strong temperature gradient , in that the inner ( outer ) dust has a higher ( lower ) temperature .",
    "the temperature of the innermost dust is determined by the dust sublimation temperature ( t @xmath11 1000 k ) . in the case of blackbody radiation ( @xmath12 [ @xmath0 m ] @xmath13 t [ k ] @xmath11 3000 ) ,",
    "the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission is dominated by dust with @xmath141000 k located in the innermost regions , while the @xmath1110 @xmath0 m continuum emission is dominated by dust with @xmath15 k located further out . thus , the dust extinction toward the @xmath1110 @xmath0 m continuum emission regions , as estimated using the optical depth of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature , is much smaller than the dust extinction toward the agn ; the dereddened agn luminosity will be underestimated if the extinction correction is made based on @xmath1110 @xmath0 m data alone .",
    "by contrast , the dust extinction toward the innermost , 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission regions , as estimated using 34 @xmath0 m data , is a better indicator of the dust extinction toward the agn itself . in the case",
    "that an agn is the only energy source , the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission predominantly originates in the innermost , 8001000 k dust .",
    "the dust extinction toward the 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission can therefore be reliably fitted with a foreground screen dust model . in a real galaxy ,",
    "weakly obscured starburst emission may contribute to the observed nuclear 34 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "however , as long as the agn is sufficiently luminous that agn - powered continuum emission contributes significantly to the observed 34 @xmath0 m flux , evidence for an agn can be found , provided that the starburst contribution is subtracted properly , even if the absorption optical depth toward the agn is larger than unity at 34 @xmath0 m ( @xmath16 mag or @xmath17 mag ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "we have previously demonstrated this in two ulirgs : iras 08572 + 3915 ( @xmath18 mag ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) , and ugc 5101 ( @xmath19 mag ; imanishi et al .",

    ", the presence of a strong temperature gradient in the dust ( a signature of an agn ) can be investigated through the comparison of the optical depths of absorption features at different wavelengths at 320 @xmath0 m @xcite .    in the study of ulirgs",

    "the seven liner ulirgs in table  [ tbl-1 ] were observed .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarizes their infrared emission properties .",
    "all have cool far - infrared colors .",
    "the optical classifications as liners are based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] summarizes the observing log .",
    "the 3.14.0 @xmath0 m slit spectrum of ugc 5101 has already been presented in @xcite .",
    "descriptions of the observations and data analysis were offered in that letter .",
    "to summarize , the observations were made at the irtf on mauna kea , hawaii , using the grism mode of nsfcam @xcite .",
    "although the wavelength coverage of the nsfcam grism mode is 2.84.1 @xmath0 m , results at @xmath27 3.1 @xmath0 m were not presented in @xcite because our main aim in that study was to investigate the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission and 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption features , and because the earth s atmospheric transmission at 2.83.1 @xmath0 m is poorer than at @xmath28 3.3 @xmath0 m . however , after the publication of @xcite , @xcite reported the detection of 6.0 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption in ugc 5101 , and suggested that the 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption feature might be present in our 3.14.0 @xmath0 m spectrum .",
    "therefore we carefully analyzed the spectrum at 2.83.1 @xmath0 m to investigate the 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption feature , whose profile is very broad , extending over at least @xmath29 2.83.3 @xmath0 m in the rest - frame ( smith , sellgren , & tokunaga 1989 ) .",
    "the 2.84.1 @xmath0 m spectra of the other ulirgs were obtained with the infrared spectrograph and camera ( ircs ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2000 ) at the subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the sky was clear during the observations of these objects and the seeing at k was measured to be 0@xmath3050@xmath308 in full - width at half maximum .",
    "a 0@xmath309-wide slit and the @xmath10-grism were used with a 58-mas pixel scale .",
    "the achievable spectral resolution is @xmath11140 at 3.5 @xmath0 m . a standard telescope nodding technique , with a throw of 7 arcsec along the slit ,",
    "was employed to subtract background emission .",
    "ulirgs and corresponding standard stars were observed with an airmass difference of @xmath40.1 to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere , and to provide flux calibration .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed , using iraf .",
    "initially , bad pixels were replaced with interpolated signals from the surrounding pixels .",
    "bias was subsequently subtracted from the obtained frames and the frames were divided by a spectroscopic flat frame .",
    "finally the spectra of ulirgs and standard stars were extracted .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed taking into account the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectra of ulirgs were divided by the observed spectra of standard stars , multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures appropriate to individual standard stars ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) , and then flux - calibrated .",
    "appropriate binning of spectral elements was performed , particularly at @xmath31 @xmath0 m in the observed frame , so as to give an adequate signal - to - noise ratio in each element .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution @xmath32 at @xmath31 @xmath0 m is @xmath6100 .",
    "although the earth s atmospheric transmission curve at 2.83.3 @xmath0 m is highly wavelength - dependent if observed at high spectral resolution of @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig1]a ) , it is fairly smooth at lower spectral resolutions , with r @xmath6 100 ( figure  [ fig1]b ) . thus , even if the net positions of the target object and standard star on the slit differ slightly ( on the sub - pixel scale ) along the wavelength direction , the standard data analysis described above is expected to produce no significant spurious features in spectra with r @xmath6 100 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows flux - calibrated 2.84.1 @xmath0 m spectra of the seven ulirgs .",
    "since our slit spectra cover physical scales larger than a few hundred pc in all the ulirgs , emission from both agns and compact ( less than a few hundred pc ) starbursts should be fully detected .",
    "all the ulirgs clearly show the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission .",
    "to estimate its flux , luminosity , and rest - frame equivalent width , we make the reasonable assumption that the profiles of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in these ulirgs are similar to those of galactic star - forming regions and nearby starburst galaxies ; the main emission profile then extends between @xmath34 @xmath23 3.243.35 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the flux excess above the solid lines in figure  [ fig2 ] should thus be ascribed to the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] summarizes the results for the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in these seven ulirgs .",
    "the spectrum of ugc 5101 shows clear 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption with an observed optical depth of @xmath35 = 0.65 @xcite . in other ulirgs , there is no clear indication of this feature , partly because this absorption feature is intrinsically not so strong ( @xmath35/a@xmath5 @xmath11 0.0040.007 ; pendleton et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "in addition to the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature , there is another important common feature of the spectra of five ulirgs ( ugc 5101 , iras 00188@xmath360856 , iras 03250 + 1606 , iras 16487 + 5447 , and iras 21329@xmath362346 ) : the continuum emission is concave in these spectra . at the shorter wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission",
    ", the continuum flux level initially decreases with decreasing wavelength , but then begins to increase again at @xmath37 @xmath0 m . in iras 00188@xmath360856 and iras 03250 + 1606 , the spectra become flat at the shortest wavelength parts ( @xmath34 @xmath4 2.7 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that of the infrared - luminous galaxy ngc 4945 , in which 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption was clearly detected in an _ iso _ spectrum @xcite .",
    "earlier ground - based @xmath10-band spectroscopy has revealed that many bright galactic sources behind substantial columns of dust and molecular gas show broad 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption , with a main profile peaking at @xmath34 @xmath11 3.05 @xmath0 m and extending at least to @xmath34 @xmath23 2.83.3 @xmath0 m ( smith et al .",
    "1989 ; smith , sellgren , & tokunaga 1993 ; smith 1993 ) . a recent _ iso _ spectrum of ngc 4945 suggests that the absorption may extend to wavelengths as short as @xmath38 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "in addition to this main profile , a weak longer - wavelength wing at @xmath393.7 @xmath0 m can also be distinguished @xcite .",
    "the concave - shaped continuum emission found in the spectra of these five ulirgs is consistent with the presence of this broad 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption .",
    "some seyfert 2 galaxies with lower infrared luminosities were observed on the same nights as these ulirgs , but no signatures of strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption were found .",
    "the spectra of standard stars observed before these ulirgs on the same nights were divided by other standard stars observed after , but the resulting spectra also never showed such signatures .",
    "the strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption signatures found only in the spectra of the ulirgs are thus believed to be genuine and intrinsic to the ulirgs , and not an artifact caused by insufficient cancellation of the earth s atmospheric transmission .",
    "in fact , for ugc 5101 and iras 00188@xmath360856 , the clear detection of h@xmath1o ice absorption at 6.0 @xmath0 m was also reported by @xcite .    to estimate conservative lower limits for the optical depths of the broad 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption feature , the concave quadratic dashed lines in figure  [ fig2 ] are adopted as the lowest plausible continuum levels . in iras 23234 + 0946 and iras 23327 + 2913 , the presence of strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption is not clear in the case of the adopted concave continuum .",
    "for the remaining five ulirgs , the observed optical depths of the 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o absorption ( @xmath40 ) as well as the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption ( @xmath35 ) are summarized in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "these @xmath40 values should be regarded as strict lower limits because : ( 1 ) linear continuum levels that connect data points at the shortest and longest wavelength parts of the spectra would give rise to larger values of @xmath40 , and ( 2 ) the data points at the shortest wavelength parts , used to determine continuum levels , may still be affected by the 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption feature in some cases . compared to ugc 5101 , iras 00188@xmath360856 and iras 21329@xmath362346 , the presence of the broad h@xmath1o ice absorption feature is apparently less clear in iras 03250 + 1606 and iras 16487 + 5447 . however , as long as the spectral shapes of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in these ulirgs do not differ significantly from those observed so far in starburst galaxies , the continuum flux levels on the shorter wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission are clearly lower than on the longer wavelength side , which is consistent with the presence of the broad 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption .",
    "the very broad emission - like features that extend between @xmath41 3.63.9 @xmath0 m and 3.43.8 @xmath0 m in iras 03250 + 1606 and iras 16487 + 5447 , respectively , can not be ascribed solely to the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission ; instead , they are caused by a combination of 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption , 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission , and ( possibly ) 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption .",
    "the observed 3.3 @xmath0 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios for these seven ulirgs are l@xmath42/l@xmath43 @xmath11 13 @xmath4410@xmath45 ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) , which are 3 to 10 times smaller than the ratios for starburst galaxies ( l@xmath42/l@xmath43 @xmath11 10@xmath46 ; mouri et al . 1900 ; imanishi 2002 ) .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that _ weakly obscured ( a@xmath47 mag ) nuclear _ starbursts are not contributing significantly to the infrared luminosities of these ulirgs .",
    "since the l@xmath42 values are based on slit spectroscopy measurements , the luminosities of _ extended _ ( kpc scale ) weakly obscured starbursts are not taken into account .",
    "however , as mentioned in @xmath481 , such extended starbursts have been shown to be energetically insignificant in ulirgs @xcite . for ugc 5101 , @xcite estimated , based on the _ iso _ s large aperture measurement , a 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission flux of @xmath49 w @xmath50 , so that its luminosity is @xmath51 ergs s@xmath24 in our adopted cosmology .",
    "the resulting @xmath52 , which is only @xmath53 of the ratio typically seen in starburst galaxies ( @xmath54 : fischer 2000 ) .",
    "thus , weakly obscured extended starbursts are unlikely to be the dominant energy source in ugc 5101 , either .",
    "the dominant energy sources should be compact and heavily obscured ; for the five ulirgs , the presence of such buried energy sources is supported by the detection of strong absorption features in our 2.84.1 @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "the detection of strong ( @xmath40 @xmath55 0.6 ) 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption can , in principle , provide stringent constraints on the nature of the buried energy sources at the nuclei of the five ulirgs .",
    "the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous and 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features are detectable if an adequate amount of dust in the _ diffuse inter - stellar medium _",
    "is present in front of the continuum - emitting energy sources .",
    "however , in order for h@xmath1o ice absorption to be detected , dust grains _ covered with an ice mantle _ must be present in the foreground .",
    "such a situation can arise only when the dust grains are located in molecular clouds , and are sufficiently shielded from the uv radiation from any energy sources either inside or outside the molecular clouds @xcite . in other words , the detection of strong h@xmath1o ice absorption requires that a large amount of dust in _ molecular clouds _",
    "be present in front of the continuum - emitting energy sources .",
    "foreground molecular clouds in the host galaxies could be responsible for the strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption detected toward the nuclei if the host galaxies were seen from nearly edge - on .",
    "however , there is no strong evidence that the host galaxies of these ulirgs are edge - on @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that 6.0 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption is systematically stronger in ulirgs than in less infrared - luminous seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "these seyfert 2 galaxies also generally show no detectable or weak ( @xmath56 ) 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption ( imanishi et al . 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "the systematically larger optical depths of h@xmath1o ice absorption toward the nuclei of ulirgs can reasonably be explained by a larger amount of highly concentrated molecular gas ( and dust ) in their nuclei @xcite .",
    "we thus regard it as likely that the strong ( @xmath40 @xmath55 0.6 ) 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption detected toward the nuclei of these five ulirgs are caused by nuclear concentrations of molecular gas and dust .",
    "note that , although the host galaxy of ngc 4945 is viewed edge - on @xcite , a significant fraction of the strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption ( @xmath57 ; spoon et al .",
    "2000 ) is likely to originate in a highly concentrated nuclear component of ice - covered dust grains , on a scale of less than a few hundred pc @xcite .    in the case of _ normal _ starbursts , it seems reasonable to assume that the continuum - emitting sources and molecular gas and dust are spatially well mixed @xcite .",
    "a detailed infrared study of the nearby starburst galaxy m82 suggests that the mixed - dust geometry is a better fit to the observed data than a foreground screen dust distribution @xcite .",
    "since the oscillator strengths of species are fixed , there are upper limits on the absorption optical depths that can be produced by the mixed - dust geometry ( unless unusual abundances are considered ) .",
    "this is because the foreground , less - obscured , and therefore less - attenuated , emission ( which shows only weak absorption features ) will dominate the observed fluxes . in practice ,",
    "nearby starburst galaxies such as m82 and ngc 253 show weak ( @xmath58 @xmath11 0.2 ) or undetectable absorption by h@xmath1o ice @xcite or dust grains @xcite . this issue will be discussed quantitatively below .    in galactic molecular clouds , the optical depth of the h@xmath1o ice absorption and dust extinction ( @xmath59 )",
    "are correlated , with a relation given by @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 has been found to be almost constant , @xmath110.06 , in galactic molecular clouds , which exhibit various different levels of star - forming activity @xcite .",
    "this is because it reflects the abundance of h@xmath1o ice relative to dust grains in the regions where an ice mantle can survive ; it is therefore unlikely to differ substantially from the galactic value , even in starburst galaxies .",
    "the a@xmath62 value in the above relation is the threshold required for dust grains to be sufficiently shielded from the ambient uv radiation .",
    "this value can vary dramatically , from 26 mag in quiescent molecular clouds ( taurus and serpens ; whittet et al .",
    "1988 ; eiroa & hodapp 1989 ; murakawa et al . 2000 ) to 15 mag in active star - forming molecular clouds ( @xmath63-oph ; tanaka et al .",
    "1990 ) . in starburst galaxies with a more intense uv radiation field than the @xmath63-oph molecular clouds , @xmath64 is almost certainly larger than 15 mag , but its exact value is unknown .",
    "thus the relation @xmath65 is adopted in starburst galaxies , where @xmath66 mag , or @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fraction of dust that is covered with an ice mantle .",
    "figures  [ fig3]a and  [ fig3]b show schematic diagrams of a mixed - dust geometry . in this geometry , the observed flux i(@xmath69 ) is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an unattenuated intrinsic flux and @xmath69 is the optical depth at each wavelength , which takes different values inside and outside the absorption features . for 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission outside the 3.1 @xmath0 m",

    "the observed optical depth of the 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption is @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "based on these values , @xmath77 is obtained .",
    "in other words , in the starburst galaxy m82 , @xmath78 of dust grains are covered with an ice mantle .",
    "if the cores of ulirgs are simply a scaled - up version of normal starbursts with a mixed - dust geometry and the @xmath68-value is @xmath110.3 , then @xmath40 should be @xmath110.2 . however , the @xmath68-value is strongly dependent on the fraction of active star - forming regions relative to quiescent molecular gas in molecular clouds .",
    "if the cores of ulirgs are powered by starbursts with a mixed - dust geometry , the @xmath68-value in ulirgs should be even smaller than in less infrared luminous starburst galaxies @xcite . here ,",
    "however , @xmath68 @xmath11 0.3 is adopted for ulirgs in order to determine a conservative upper limit for @xmath40 within the framework of a mixed - dust geometry .",
    "even if this conservative value is adopted , equation ( 7 ) shows that @xmath40 can not be larger than 0.3 .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that _ the observed @xmath40 values of @xmath550.6 in these five ulirgs are clearly incompatible with mixed - dust geometry and f @xmath79 0.3_. when the contribution from any weakly obscured starburst emission to the observed 34 @xmath0 m fluxes is subtracted , the @xmath40 values toward the buried energy sources will be even larger , making this conclusion more robust .",
    "the same argument is applicable to the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption in ugc 5101 @xcite .",
    "for the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature , @xmath80 is obtained @xcite , where the term @xmath81 , the fraction of dust grains not covered by an ice mantle , is included because the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature may be suppressed if the dust grains are covered with an ice mantle @xcite . based on the same arguments as above , it can be quantitatively demonstrated that @xmath35 can not be larger than 0.2 in the mixed - dust geometry .",
    "the observed large optical depth of @xmath82 in ugc 5101 @xcite is again incompatible with a mixed - dust source geometry .    in order to explain the strong absorption features in these five ulirgs , dust in a foreground screen must be obscuring the 34 @xmath0 m continuum - emitting energy sources",
    "this configuration requires that the energy sources be centrally concentrated and deeply buried in nuclear dust and molecular gas , as shown in figure  [ fig3]c .",
    "the centrally - concentrated nature of the buried energy source in ugc 5101 is naturally explained by a buried agn @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in @xmath481 , the observed rest - frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in starburst galaxies should be little changed by dust extinction . the significantly lower equivalent width in ugc 5101 ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) than in starbursts",
    "( @xmath11120 nm ; moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) also supports the presence of agns that produce strong 34 @xmath0 m continuum emission , but essentially no pah emission .",
    "when our data are combined with ground - based high spatial resolution mid - infrared ( 825 @xmath0 m ) imaging data @xcite , we can give more insight into the nature of the buried energy source .",
    "@xcite estimated the size of the spatially - unresolved core of ugc 5101 at 12.5 @xmath0 m to be @xmath4200 pc .",
    "if the attenuation of the mid - infrared flux from the spatially - unresolved compact core in ugc 5101 is negligible , the surface brightness of the core emission becomes @xmath551.0 @xmath13 10@xmath83 kpc@xmath84 @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of strong 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust and 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption toward the nucleus of ugc 5101 requires that    1 .",
    "the actual size of the buried centrally - concentrated energy source is substantially smaller than that of the dust and molecular gas , and 2 .",
    "the dust extinction toward the buried energy source is @xmath85 mag @xcite .",
    "on point ( 1 ) , since dust around a centrally - concentrated energy source shows a temperature gradient ( see @xmath481 ) , the size of the cooler dust region , which is also responsible for the foreground dust extinction , is larger than that of the @xmath11250 k dust traced by the 12.5 @xmath0 m emission ( @xmath4200 pc ) .",
    "however , the size of the cool dust emission ( traced by the 1.3 mm emission ) at the core of the ulirg arp 220 has been shown to be compact ( @xmath4200 pc ; sakamoto et al .",
    "furthermore , the sizes of the high density molecular gas regions at the cores of ulirgs have been estimated to be no more than @xmath11500 pc in diameter @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to assume that the actual size of the buried centrally - concentrated energy source in ugc 5101 is only a fraction of this , @xmath11100 pc or less . on point ( 2 ) , the dust extinction of @xmath19 mag means that the flux attenuation at 12.5 @xmath0 m is more than factor of 25 @xcite .",
    "when these corrections are taken into account , the actual surface brightness of the centrally - concentrated buried energy source in ugc 5101 is @xmath86 kpc@xmath84 .",
    "this exceeds the peak surface brightness of star clusters in starburst galaxies ( @xmath115 @xmath13 10@xmath87 kpc@xmath84 ; meurer et al . 1997 ; soifer et al .",
    "2000 ) by a factor of more than two .",
    "the high surface brightness is best explained by the presence of an energetically important buried agn in ugc 5101 .",
    "if a buried agn is present at the nucleus of ugc 5101 , the dust is expected to show a strong temperature gradient ( see @xmath481 ) .",
    "are the available data consistent with its presence ?",
    "@xcite could not explicitly find the signature of a temperature gradient based on their imaging data of ugc 5101 . here",
    ", it is searched for using spectroscopic data . as mentioned in @xmath481 and @xcite , if a strong temperature gradient is present in the dust , the optical depth of the 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature probes deeper into the dust distribution than that of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption .",
    "thus , the @xmath35/@xmath88 ratio toward the nucleus of ugc 5101 is expected to be significantly larger than the value seen when no significant temperature gradient is present ( @xmath35/@xmath890.07 ; roche & aitken 1984 , 1985 ; pendleton et al .",
    "1994 ) .    after subtracting the contribution from the weakly obscured starburst emission to the observed 34 @xmath0 m flux ,",
    "the @xmath35 value toward the buried agn at the core of ugc 5101 was estimated to be @xmath110.8 @xcite , while only a lower limit for the observed @xmath88 value ( @xmath551.5 ) was given by @xcite based on a measurement with a large aperture using _",
    "iso_. although the @xmath88 value is a lower limit , its actual value is unlikely to exceed 2.0 , judging from the actual spectrum of ugc 5101 ( spoon et al .",
    "2002 ; their figure 8) .",
    "thus the @xmath35/@xmath88 ratio is @xmath90 .",
    "the actual @xmath88 value toward the buried agn in ugc 5101 could be larger than the observed value , because weakly obscured starburst emission is likely to contribute significantly to the observed @xmath1110 @xmath0 m _ iso _ flux .",
    "however , since the equivalent width of the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission in the _ iso _ spectrum of ugc 5101 is less than half that of starburst galaxies @xcite , at least half of the observed continuum flux at @xmath555 @xmath0 m should originate in the buried agn , implying that the @xmath35/@xmath88 ratio toward the buried agn is @xmath91 .",
    "thus , these spectroscopic data are consistent with the presence of a temperature gradient of dust at the core of ugc 5101 .",
    "if the dust around an agn has a torus - like geometry , low - density clumpy clouds which are directly illuminated by the central agn can exist at relatively large distances from the agn along the axis of the torus - geometry dust ( the so - called the narrow line regions or nlrs ) .",
    "nlrs produce the strong high - excitation forbidden emission lines seen in agn .",
    "however , in a buried agn , x - ray dissociation regions ( maloney et al . 1996 ) , rather than nlrs , are expected to be produced around the agn , so that high - excitation forbidden emission lines will be weak , consistent with the observed data of ugc 5101 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the infrared to hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) luminosity ratios in ulirgs , including ugc 5101 @xcite , roughly follow the relation established in less infrared - luminous starburst galaxies . by regarding the hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) luminosities as a tracer of the mass of high density ( @xmath5510@xmath92 cm@xmath46 ) molecular gas where star - formation actually occurs",
    ", @xcite argued that the infrared luminosities of ulirgs are powered by starbursts .",
    "however , in the luminous inner regions ( central few hundred pc ) of ulirgs , the gas pressures - and therefore molecular gas densities - are inevitably extremely high , whether the energy sources are starbursts or agns @xcite .",
    "the relative constancy of the infrared to hcn luminosity ratio from less infrared luminous starburst galaxies to ulirgs simply indicates that much of the infrared emission arises from dust in dense molecular clouds , which is inevitable whatever the sources of the luminosities of ulirgs .",
    "for the two ulirgs which do not show strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption ( iras 23234 + 0946 and iras 23327 + 2913 ) , there is no strong observational evidence for the presence of buried agns .",
    "however , for the other four ulirgs which show strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o absorption ( iras 00188@xmath360856 , iras 03250 + 1606 , iras 16487 + 5447 , and iras 21329@xmath362346 ) , the centrally - concentrated nature of their buried energy sources and systematically ( roughly a factor of two ) lower - equivalent - width pah emission than starbursts ( table 3 ) are also naturally explained by the presence of energetically important , buried agns . assuming that approximately half of the observed 34 @xmath0 m fluxes originate in buried agns , the @xmath40 and @xmath35 toward the buried agns are twice as large as the observed values .",
    "these @xmath40 and @xmath35 values reflect the column density of foreground dust , toward the buried agns , covered with and without an ice mantle , respectively ( @xmath484.2 ) . based on the relation of @xmath40/a@xmath5 @xmath11 0.06 , @xmath35/a@xmath5 @xmath11 0.0040.007 ( @xmath48 4.2 ) , and @xmath94 @xmath11 0.06 ( @xmath48 1 ) , and on a foreground screen dust model ( @xmath48 1 ) , it is found that the dereddened 34 @xmath0 m dust emission luminosities powered by the agns could be comparable to the infrared luminosities of these four ulirgs .",
    "it is sometimes argued that ulirgs with cool far - infrared colors can not be powered by agns because agns show warm far - infrared colors ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , many known seyfert 2 galaxies show warm far - infrared colors @xcite . however , as mentioned in @xmath484.2 , the systematically higher detection rate of h@xmath1o ice absorption in ulirgs , as compared to less infrared luminous seyfert 2 galaxies , is naturally explained by a higher column density of nuclear dust in ulirgs .",
    "this explanation is supported by imaging data at @xmath1110 @xmath0 m : while emission from the nuclei of less infrared luminous seyfert 2 galaxies is argued to be optically thin at @xmath1110 @xmath0 m @xcite , that from the nuclei of ulirgs is estimated to be optically thick @xcite .",
    "the higher column densities of dust around buried agns in ulirgs can naturally produce infrared spectral energy distribution with cooler color than in less infrared luminous seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "it is quite possible that many other ulirgs with cool far - infrared colors contain energetically important agns deeply buried in dust .",
    "@xcite have found that a 60 @xmath0 m luminosity function in the local universe , derived based on @xmath1115000 galaxies , shows a bump at @xmath95 , and suggested that agn activity begins to be energetically important at @xmath96 .",
    "this result also favors the buried agn scenario in the majority of nearby ulirgs .",
    "strong ( @xmath97 ) 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption has been detected toward the nuclei of five ulirgs : ugc 5101 , iras 00188@xmath360856 , iras 03250 + 1606 , iras 16487 + 5447 , and iras 21329@xmath362346 .",
    "all these ulirgs have cool far - infrared colors and are classified optically as liners .",
    "this detection requires a foreground screen dust geometry , which is best explained if centrally - concentrated , compact energy sources are buried in nuclear dust and molecular gas .",
    "for all the ulirgs , the observed equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission are significantly lower than those of starburst galaxies .",
    "these observational data are naturally explained by the presence of agns deeply buried in dust , and support our previous arguments that liner ulirgs with cool far - infrared colors may possess energetically important , buried agns .",

    "<S> ground - based 2.84.1 @xmath0 m slit spectra of the nuclei of seven ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) that are classified optically as liners and have cool far - infrared colors are presented . </S>",
    "<S> all the nuclei show 3.3 @xmath0 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , with equivalent widths that are systematically lower than those in starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> strong 3.1 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o ice absorption , with optical depth greater than 0.6 , is also detected in five nuclei , and 3.4 @xmath0 m carbonaceous dust absorption is detected clearly in one of the five nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it is quantitatively demonstrated that the large optical depths of the h@xmath1o ice absorption in the five sources , and the 3.4 @xmath0 m absorption in one source , are incompatible with a geometry in which the energy sources are spatially mixed with dust and molecular gas , as is expected for a typical starburst , but instead require that a large amount of nuclear dust ( including ice - covered grains ) and molecular gas be distributed in a screen in front of the 34 @xmath0 m continuum - emitting sources . </S>",
    "<S> this geometrical requirement can naturally be met if the energy sources are more centrally concentrated than the nuclear dust and molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the low equivalent widths of the pah emission compared to starbursts and the central concentration of the nuclear energy sources in these five ulirgs are best explained by the presence of energetically important active galactic nuclei deeply buried in dust and molecular gas . </S>"
