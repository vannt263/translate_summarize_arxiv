    "black hole entropy @xcite provides a valuable clue in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "our understanding of it can be evaluated along two parameters .",
    "first , it is instructive to separate special properties of the gr action from the general properties of diff - invariant field theories . in particular",
    ", one wishes to compare gr to higher - derivative theories of the metric .",
    "second , some aspects of the entropy formula are understood for general solutions , while others are restricted to quasi - stationary setups .",
    "for example , in gr , the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula @xmath0 is expected to apply for quite general surfaces in general spacetimes ( at least as a bound , and with various subtleties , reviewed e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the area increase theorem , and with it the second law of black hole thermodynamics , holds even for highly non - stationary processes .",
    "now , in higher - derivative gravity , the entropy formula must be modified , as prescribed by wald @xcite . for general theories ,",
    "wald s procedure is sharply defined only in stationary spacetimes ( however , see the proposal @xcite for a non - stationary formula ) .",
    "also , a second law has only been established for quasi - stationary processes @xcite .",
    "it is possible that both problems may be solved at once : a correct formula for non - stationary entropy may be identified by requiring an increase law .",
    "this has been achieved for @xmath1 theories , i.e. for lagrangians polynomial in the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "in addition to the laws of black hole thermodynamics , it s important to consider more direct derivations of the entropy .",
    "such derivations convince us that the thermodynamic interpretation is more than an analogy .",
    "they also provide us with the constant coefficient in the entropy formula .",
    "these derivations must involve at least some element of quantum mechanics , to produce the necessary @xmath2 factor ( which we neglected above , working in qft units ) . in this category",
    ", we have hawking s calculation of the black - body radiation @xcite , the analysis of euclidean black holes @xcite , as well as t hooft s s - matrix approach @xcite . also notable",
    "is the local approach in @xcite , based on entanglement entropy .",
    "these arguments are all restricted to stationary backgrounds .",
    "we see that much of our understanding of black hole entropy relies on stationarity , more so in higher - derivative theories .",
    "the scale at which stationarity is typically required is the time scale @xmath3 of the inverse surface gravity ( or inverse temperature ) .",
    "is this a sensible situation ?",
    "on one hand , it stands to reason that a thermodynamic quantity is sharply defined only for stationary systems . on the other hand",
    ", there seems to be a mismatch of the relevant scales .",
    "@xmath3 is a macroscopic length , while the entropy supposedly arises from fluctuations at the planck scale ( and perhaps at other characteristic scales in a higher - derivative lagrangian ) . to put this differently , both the bekenstein and wald formulas for the entropy give a local surface density that is independent of the surface gravity scale .",
    "it is therefore strange that @xmath4 should be relevant to any restrictions on the entropy formula . in particular , in gr , one would imagine that _ any _ surface with a smooth , classical geometry is sufficiently stationary and homogeneous , as far as planck - scale fluctuations are concerned .",
    "therefore , one should always have an entropy formula that is simply additive over such surfaces .",
    "we conclude that it would be desirable to derive the gravitational entropy , including its @xmath2-dependent proportionality constant , without making use of stationarity . in @xcite , a candidate for such",
    "a derivation was presented .",
    "there , it was pointed out that the on - shell gr action in a null - bounded region , specifically the boundary term , has an area - proportional imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part , arising from an analytical continuation of boost angles , has the same form as the bekenstein entropy formula .",
    "no assumption of stationarity was required for this result .",
    "the result also holds in the presence of arbitrary minimally - coupled matter , and therefore shares the `` universal '' nature of black hole entropy . on the other hand",
    ", the connection to actual black hole solutions remained unclear .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we review and elaborate on the argument in @xcite , extending it to non - null closed boundaries in lorentzian spacetime .",
    "in particular , we find the imaginary part of the gr action for smooth ( or mixed signature ) boundaries , for purely - spacelike boundaries and for purely - timelike ones .",
    "we also present a more flexible alternative approach to the analytical continuation involved .",
    "the general result for the action s imaginary part takes the form : @xmath5 here , the sum is over the `` signature - flip surfaces '' where the boundary normal goes from timelike to spacelike or vice versa .",
    "these are always present for a closed boundary , though they may be hidden inside `` corners '' - surfaces where smooth patches of the boundary intersect .",
    "@xmath6 is the entropy functional @xmath7 evaluated on each flip surface .",
    "the result is `` empirical '' , in the sense that it simply comes out from a careful evaluation of the action s boundary term . as a first step towards clarifying the precise relationship between and the concept of black hole entropy",
    ", we identify a particular relation that applies to stationary black holes .",
    "specifically , for any such black hole , we indicate a class of purely - spacelike , purely - timelike and purely - null closed boundaries , such that @xmath8 for the corresponding region evaluates precisely to the black hole entropy @xmath9 .",
    "a factor of @xmath2 arises implicitly when the action is treated as dimensionless .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , our results complement the analysis of euclidean black holes @xcite .",
    "there , one also encounters an imaginary on - shell action in gr .",
    "roughly , this leads to an exponential damping of transition amplitudes @xmath10 , which can be ascribed to a multiplicity of states .",
    "more precisely , the imaginary action in @xcite is interpreted as the logarithm @xmath11 of a partition function . from the latter ,",
    "one extracts the entropy , after correcting for terms related to conserved charges .",
    "these terms are e.g. @xmath12 for energy and @xmath13 for angular momentum ( @xmath14 are respectively the energy , temperature , angular momentum and angular velocity ) . for a euclidean black hole , the correction terms can be viewed as contributions from the boundary at infinity , while the entropy itself is a contribution from the horizon @xcite .",
    "the derivation here and in @xcite has a number of advantages over the euclidean one .",
    "first , it traces the imaginary action directly to properties of lorentzian geometry .",
    "the analytical continuation we employ is more subtle , with no wick rotation of the metric . as a result",
    ", stationarity is not required : one can calculate the imaginary action for arbitrary solutions .",
    "also , the calculation works with finite regions , with no reference to the asymptotic boundary .",
    "this is more physical , especially in a positive-@xmath15 cosmology .",
    "finally , we recover the entropy formula _ directly _ from the imaginary action , with no correction terms such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "this can be traced both to the use of finite regions ( there are no `` terms at infinity '' to speak of ) and to the absence of a stationarity requirement ( without it , thermodynamic potentials like @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not well - defined ) .    on the other hand , our result is incomplete .",
    "apart from the considerations above , there is no precise understanding as to why the imaginary action should be an entropy .",
    "there is only the fact that the two quantities agree for stationary black holes .",
    "thus , what we have is not quite a non - stationary calculation of entropy , but a non - stationary calculation of _ something _ - the imaginary action - that agrees with the entropy in the stationary case . at the end of the paper , we speculate on the possibility that in general , the imaginary action _ supplants _ the concept of entropy .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we generalize the gr calculation to higher - derivative theories .",
    "since the action s imaginary part arises from the boundary term , we restrict to theories with a standard boundary - data formulation .",
    "for gravity without matter , the only such theories are of the lanczos - lovelock type @xcite .",
    "thus , we set out to find the imaginary part of the action in lovelock gravity , using the boundary term found in @xcite .",
    "as with gr , the result takes the form , where @xmath9 is now the appropriate entropy functional for lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "the result @xmath18 for a special class of regions in a stationary black hole spacetime is also recovered .    at certain points in the higher - derivative calculation",
    ", we assume that the relevant spacetime regions are large with respect to the higher - order lovelock couplings .",
    "the gr term then dominates , allowing us to evade the open questions regarding the positivity and increase of the entropy functional .",
    "this assumption does _ not _ entail stationarity at the surface gravity scale . also , the calculation remains exact ( up to quantum corrections ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : gr : smooth]-[sec : gr : null ] , we elaborate on the treatment of the gr action from @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : gr : black_hole ] , we recover the entropy of a stationary black hole from the action in suitable regions . in section",
    "[ sec : compare ] , we consider alternative recipes for evaluating the action , while addressing some objections that our procedure may raise . in section [ sec : lovelock ] , we generalize these results to lovelock gravity .",
    "section [ sec : discuss ] is devoted to discussion and outlook .    in the formulas and figures below ,",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath19 has mostly - plus signature .",
    "the spacetime dimension is @xmath20 .",
    "we use indices @xmath21 for spacetime coordinates , @xmath22 for coordinates on a codimension-1 hypersurface , and @xmath23 for coordinates on a codimension-2 surface . the sign convention for the riemann tensor is @xmath24v^\\mu$ ] .",
    "in this section , we consider general relativity with no higher - derivative terms .",
    "we allow for an arbitrary cosmological constant @xmath15 and minimally - coupled matter with lagrangian @xmath25 . in this setup",
    ", black hole entropy is expected to be given by the bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath0 .      in this subsection",
    ", we derive the imaginary part of the gr action in a region @xmath17 with a smooth boundary .",
    "the discussion here follows and expands on that in @xcite .",
    "the complete action in the spacetime region @xmath17 reads : @xmath26 the second integral is the gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite , which will be our object of interest .",
    "@xmath27 is the determinant of the boundary metric .",
    "@xmath28 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath29 .",
    "the normal @xmath30 is chosen to be an outgoing covector , i.e. to have a positive scalar product with outgoing vectors .",
    "this makes the _ vector _",
    "@xmath31 outgoing , ingoing or tangent , for timelike , spacelike and null boundaries , respectively .",
    "see figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath32 in the denominator makes eq .",
    "valid for normals of arbitrary length and signature .",
    "in particular , @xmath31 need not be a unit vector .",
    "this will facilitate the discussion of the null limit .",
    "we wish to show that the boundary term in has an imaginary part .",
    "we begin by recalling its geometric structure in flat 2d spacetime .",
    "there , the boundary @xmath33 is just a 1d curve .",
    "the gibbons - hawking integral simply adds up the infinitesimal rotation angles of the normal @xmath31 as we travel along the boundary : @xmath34 in lorentzian spacetime , this expression must be handled with care .",
    "the `` angles '' @xmath35 are actually boost parameters , and these can diverge . to correctly evaluate the integral over a closed boundary , one needs a consistent assignment of boost angles throughout the lorentzian plane .",
    "thus , we want to assign an angle @xmath36 to each vector @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "this is non - trivial , since the angle covers the entire range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 within a single quadrant , e.g. @xmath41 .",
    "we must analytically continue @xmath36 beyond this quadrant , which unavoidably takes it into the complex plane .",
    "this can be done @xcite by analytically continuing the trigonometric formulas : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and we define : @xmath44 as will become clear below , the complex - conjugate choice @xmath45 is ruled out by the requirement that quantum transition amplitudes @xmath46 do not explode exponentially .",
    "the angle assignment is illustrated in figure [ fig : angles_plane ] .",
    "in particular , the angle @xmath36 picks up an imaginary contribution @xmath47 whenever we cross a null line counter - clockwise into a neighboring quadrant .",
    "the total angle for a complete counter - clockwise circuit is @xmath48 .",
    "our conventions here differ from @xcite by an overall factor of @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , we treat continuous boost angles within a quadrant as real .     in the lorentzian plane , according to eq . .",
    "this is one of two complex - conjugate choices , distinguished by the sign convention .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes describe the spacelike and timelike components of a vector @xmath31 .",
    "the angles are defined up to integer multiples of @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    let us now apply this angle assignment to the normal @xmath31 on our closed boundary @xmath33 .",
    "the boundary must be composed of both spacelike and timelike regions",
    ". see figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of @xmath31 at various points .",
    "the complex numbers indicate the normal s angle in the lorentzian plane .     from figure [",
    "fig : angles_plane ] , as applied to the normal vectors of a smooth closed boundary in 1 + 1d spacetime .",
    "the arrows indicate the normal direction .",
    "the normal s sign is chosen so that it has a positive scalar product with outgoing vectors .",
    "empty circles denote `` signature flips '' , where the normal becomes momentarily null .",
    "contributions to the gibbons - hawking boundary term can be read off by traveling counter - clockwise and picking up angle differences , multiplied by @xmath51 .",
    "the angles are defined up to integer multiples of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a real finite deficit angle arising from spacetime curvature.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the integral may now be evaluated by summing up the angle differences as one travels counter - clockwise along the boundary ( note that this makes @xmath31 rotate _ clockwise _ - a peculiarity of lorentzian spacetime ) .",
    "one can verify that this recipe produces the correct signs , by comparing with an explicit computation of @xmath28 for a purely spacelike or timelike patch of the boundary .",
    "multiplying by the @xmath51 coefficient in , we get the corresponding contributions to the action .    in particular , figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] shows that each time the boundary flips its signature , i.e. momentarily becomes null , the gibbons - hawking integral picks up an imaginary contribution of @xmath54 .",
    "this results in a contribution of @xmath55 to the action .",
    "this behavior is the same as if the boundary turned a sharp corner by an angle @xmath56 .",
    "we see that while the signature flips may be smooth in the topological sense , the boundary s angle there has an imaginary discontinuity .",
    "this conclusion carries through beyond flat 2d spacetime . in curved 2d spacetime ,",
    "the change in the angle of @xmath31 upon a complete circuit of the boundary is no longer @xmath50 , but has an additional real contribution due to the riemann curvature .",
    "thus , one can not consistently assign to each point a real part @xmath57 as was done in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] .",
    "however , the angle s imaginary part behaves the same as in the flat case , picking up contributions of @xmath54 at each signature flip .",
    "the divergences in the angle s real part are also unambiguous .    in @xmath58 dimensions , the gibbons - hawking integral no longer has the simple interpretation .",
    "however , when the boundary turns a sharp corner by an angle @xmath59 , the situation is _ effectively _ two - dimensional .",
    "such a corner is a codimension-2 surface in spacetime , with some area @xmath60 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature component @xmath61 in perpendicular to the corner surface , i.e. the component `` along the bend '' , has a delta - function singularity .",
    "its integral over a small neighborhood @xmath62 of the corner reads @xcite : @xmath63 the @xmath59 factor arises from the integral along the bend , as in , while the @xmath60 factor arises from the integral over the corner surface .",
    "the resulting contribution to the action reads : @xmath64    signature flips in @xmath58 also occur at codimension-2 surfaces .",
    "there should be at least two such surfaces : one at the edge of the boundary s `` initial '' spacelike patch , and one at the edge of the `` final '' spacelike patch .",
    "each of these corresponds to a pair of points in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] .",
    "let us denote the areas of these two surfaces by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "if the flip surfaces are composed of a greater number of connected components , as in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] , then we interpret @xmath65 and @xmath66 as the _ total _ areas of the initial and final flip surfaces .",
    "as we ve seen in the 2d discussion , the normal s angle at the signature flips ( as measured in the 1 + 1d plane transverse to the flip surface ) has an imaginary discontinuity @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the flip surfaces behave as corners , and eqs . -",
    "we conclude that the boundary term , and with it the entire action , has the following imaginary part : @xmath68 this comes together with possible divergent contributions to @xmath69 , since the real part of the angle diverges at the flip surfaces . in 1 + 1d , where the `` areas '' are all equal to @xmath70 ,",
    "the divergences cancel out .",
    "the boundary term in that case equals @xmath71 , plus a finite real piece due to the deficit angle ( which cancels against the bulk einstein - hilbert term ) .",
    "the result , together with the convention @xmath46 for quantum amplitudes , justifies our sign choice .",
    "the complex - conjugate choice would have resulted in negative @xmath8 , and thus exponentially large absolute values for the amplitudes @xmath72 ( note that in the semiclassical regime , @xmath73 ) .      before proceeding , we present an additional derivation of the formula @xmath67 for the boundary",
    "s bending angle at a signature flip .",
    "this will provide a second perspective on the analytical continuation involved .",
    "also , the technique presented here will prove useful in the higher - derivative calculation in section [ sec : lovelock ] .",
    "consider a point on one of the flip surfaces .",
    "as the flip surface is crossed , the boundary normal @xmath31 rotates in the orthogonal 1 + 1d plane . in fact , since @xmath31 becomes null during the signature flip , we must speak of rotation together with rescaling .",
    "the 1 + 1d plane is spanned by two null vectors @xmath74 , each with an arbitrary extent .",
    "one of the null vectors , say @xmath75 , is tangent ( and normal ) to our boundary .",
    "thus , we may identify @xmath75 with the value of @xmath31 at the flip surface .",
    "the other null vector , @xmath76 , is transverse to the boundary .",
    "see figure [ fig : tangent_transverse ] .    .",
    "the other lightsheet is transverse , and has a different null normal @xmath76 .",
    "the extents of the two null vectors are arbitrary.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in the infinitesimal neighborhood of the flip surface , we may express @xmath31 as a linear combination of @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we wish to find the boost angle traced out by the vector as it crosses through the null direction of @xmath75 .",
    "in such a process , @xmath80 crosses through zero .",
    "consider , then , an infinitesimal change in @xmath31 : @xmath81 the part of @xmath82 orthogonal to @xmath31 reads : @xmath83 the square of the infinitesimal boost angle is then given by : @xmath84 the minus sign in the second expression is related to the lorentzian signature .",
    "it ensures a positive @xmath85 for boosts that do not involve signature flips .",
    "note that the overall scaling @xmath86 dropped out , as expected .",
    "for @xmath35 , we get : @xmath87 the sign in front of @xmath88 is related to the orientation of the pair @xmath74 . for analyticity , it should be the same for both signs of @xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent with the angle assignment in figure [ fig : angles_plane ] .",
    "we can now find the bending angle at the signature flip as the integral of @xmath35 as @xmath80 crosses through zero : @xmath89 here , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are small real numbers , with @xmath90 negative and @xmath91 positive . to resolve the divergence at @xmath92",
    ", we deform the integration contour into the complex @xmath80 plane .",
    "the contour can bypass the @xmath92 pole either from above or from below , giving two complex - conjugate results .",
    "this is the same ambiguity as the one in , which was resolved by .",
    "the imaginary part can be found from the difference between the two contours , i.e. from a closed - contour integral around the pole : @xmath93 where the two complex - conjugate options translate into the closed contour s orientation . making the choice that leads to a positive @xmath8",
    ", we arrive again at the result @xmath67 .",
    "the real part of the angle depends on the choice of endpoints @xmath94 . in terms of figure",
    "[ fig : angles_plane ] , this is just the arbitrary choice of where in the timelike and spacelike quadrants the signature flip `` begins '' and `` ends '' .",
    "so far , our discussion revolved around smooth boundaries , where the signature - flip surfaces act as effective corners . also of interest",
    "are boundaries with actual topological corners , i.e. surfaces where the boundary is non - differentiable .",
    "in particular , such corners are necessary if we wish to draw a closed boundary of fixed causal type .",
    "any boundary with corners can be viewed as a limiting case of a smooth boundary .",
    "this involves `` resolving '' the corners into fast - bending smooth curves .",
    "the simplest example is a boundary composed of spacelike and timelike patches , just like in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] , but with corners in place of the smooth flip surfaces .",
    "such a boundary is depicted in figure [ fig : mixed_boundary ] .",
    "the imaginary part of the gr action for the corresponding region is still given by eq .",
    ", where the flip surfaces are now identified with the corners .",
    "we note that one can reverse the limiting procedure and view the smooth boundary of figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] as a limiting case of mixed - signature boundaries with corners . indeed , by boosting the local frame near a corner in figure [ fig : mixed_boundary ]",
    ", one can make the corner appear arbitrarily blunt . in this way",
    ", the boundary can be made to approach a smooth one while retaining the nonzero corner angle , and in particular its imaginary part @xmath95 .",
    "this point of view will be important for the lovelock - gravity calculation in section [ sec : lovelock ] .    .",
    "the angles real part can be arbitrary .",
    "for the particular boundary depicted here , the spacelike and timelike patches are orthogonal to each other . in this case , the angles real part is zero.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    as another example of a boundary with corners , figure [ fig : spacelike_boundary ] depicts a closed spacelike boundary .",
    "it consists of two smooth spacelike hypersurfaces - one `` initial '' and one `` final '' . the corner is their intersection surface . in 1",
    "+ 1d , this corner consists of two points . in higher dimensions , it can be a connected surface .",
    "let us denote the corner s area by @xmath96 .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    a spacelike boundary of this type can be obtained by starting from a mixed - signature boundary , as in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] or [ fig : mixed_boundary ] , and compressing the whole region outside of two spacelike `` caps '' into a surface - the corner surface .",
    "in particular , both the initial and final signature - flip surfaces get compressed into the corner surface , so that @xmath97 . as a result",
    ", the area @xmath96 is counted twice in eq . .",
    "equivalently , as one travels around the corner in figure [ fig : spacelike_boundary ] , the normal crosses _ two _ quadrant borders in the lorentzian plane , changing e.g. from future - pointing timelike to past - pointing timelike .",
    "this gives the boost angle an imaginary part @xmath98 , twice larger than for a single flip .",
    "thus , the action s imaginary part for the spacelike boundary reads : @xmath99    similarly , we can consider a purely timelike boundary .",
    "its shape can be obtained by turning figure [ fig : spacelike_boundary ] on its side . in this case",
    ", there are always two distinct corner surfaces - one initial and one final .",
    "let us denote their areas by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "again , this boundary can be constructed from a smooth one by compressing all but a timelike region . in this process , the flip surfaces ,",
    "both initial and final , get `` folded in two '' .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] , the initial and final pairs of flip points are each compressed into a single point .",
    "the resulting relation between the flip - surface areas of the smooth boundary and the corner areas of the timelike one is @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "equivalently , the corners of the timelike boundary have angles with imaginary part @xmath98 , just like in the purely spacelike case .",
    "we arrive at the following expression for @xmath8 : @xmath104    the results and - strongly resemble the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula , especially since they do not depend on the matter content . in section [ sec : gr : black_hole ] , we will show how eqs .",
    "- can be related to the entropy of a stationary black hole .",
    "we will see that the apparent factor - of-2 discrepancy between - and the bekenstein - hawking formula is resolved through the presence of two intersecting horizons . before turning to this construction ,",
    "we pause to discuss the evaluation of @xmath8 for purely null boundaries .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the imaginary part of the on - shell gr action in a region whose boundary is everywhere null .",
    "we closely follow the argument in @xcite .",
    "null boundaries arise naturally in the context of gravitational entropy .",
    "null hypersurfaces have area rather than volume as a multilinear form , making them a plausible stage for area - proportional degrees of freedom .",
    "they are also crucial for generalizations of the bekenstein bound @xcite .",
    "additional arguments for null boundaries as the correct setting for quantum gravity may be found in @xcite .",
    "a null boundary is constructed as follows ( see figure [ fig : null_boundary ] for a quick dictionary ) . at first , consider a spacetime metric not too different from minkowski space .",
    "a closed null boundary is then uniquely determined by a closed codimension-2 spacelike surface .",
    "we refer to this surface as the boundary s `` equator '' .",
    "the equator has precisely two lightrays orthogonal to it at each point .",
    "these two rays generate the lightcone in the 1 + 1d transverse timelike plane . at each point of the equator ,",
    "we choose the future - pointing half of one ray and the past - pointing half of the other . specifically , we choose the `` ingoing '' half - rays , i.e. those along which the area decreases , and which eventually intersect .",
    "thus , we limit ourselves to `` normal '' equators in the sense of @xcite , and do not consider trapped or anti - trapped ones .",
    "we terminate each ray upon its first intersection with another ray . the null boundary",
    "is then given by the union of these rays .",
    "it consists of two smooth null hypersurfaces , or `` lightsheets '' .",
    "generically , the lightray intersections away from the equator constitute a pair of codimension-2 spacelike surfaces - one for the past - ingoing rays , and one for the future - ingoing ones .",
    "we refer to these surfaces as the past and future `` tips '' , respectively . the initial ( final ) half of the boundary stretches from the equator to the past ( future ) tip .",
    "if the metric is a solution of gr with suitable energy conditions , then the boundary area decreases monotonously from the equator towards the tips @xcite .",
    "the past and future tips are then anti - trapped and trapped surfaces , respectively . in the degenerate case where the tips are single points , the two half - boundaries become lightcones .",
    "the full boundary is then a causal diamond @xcite",
    ".     dimensions with trivial topology ( but not in the black - hole setup in section [ sec : gr : black_hole ] ) , the left and right sides of the figure are understood to be connected.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    with sufficient curvature or a non - trivial topology , existence and uniqueness issues arise .",
    "for instance , in a de - sitter universe , equators above a certain size do not generate closed boundaries , because the lightrays never intersect .",

    "the normal s signature then flips , and the boost angle picks up its imaginary @xmath54 contribution . in @xmath58 dimensions , this must happen separately along each ray , so that overall we get a signature - flip _ surface _ on every lightsheet . in figure [",

    "we _ assume _ that it continues increasing until the lightsheets intersect .",
    "one way to satisfy this assumption is to place the tip surfaces at constant kruskal coordinates @xmath109 .",

    "in particular , the result does not depend on the larger area @xmath112 .",
    "the above arguments clearly extend to stationary black holes other than schwarzschild .",
    "the only requirements are a `` physical '' outside region , an interior region and a bifurcate killing horizon . moreover , to construct the timelike and null boundaries , we need only the outside region and the two horizons bounding it .",
    "we see that the factor - of-2 discrepancy between eqs . - and the bekenstein - hawking formula is resolved by having _ two _ horizon slices as the relevant corner surfaces .",
    "this should raise a suspicion that the correct numerical factor is accidental , and could have come out otherwise .",
    "however , in a stationary black hole spacetime , it s unclear how one might choose a region such that @xmath8 would still be proportional to @xmath114 , but with a different numerical factor . in particular ,",
    "if one wishes to avoid the second horizon , one must still place a second corner surface somewhere .",
    "this would make @xmath8 depend on the new corner s area , rather than just on the horizon area @xmath60 .",
    "incidentally , it is also unclear how to draw a _ smooth _ closed boundary in figure [ fig : kruskal ] such that the imaginary action would depend solely on the horizon area .",
    "we note that one could also draw a null boundary in the _ top _ quadrant of figure [ fig : kruskal ] , such that the two equator components , rather than the two tips , are horizon slices with area @xmath60",
    ". the initial tip would then be the bifurcation surface , and the final tip would be an arbitrary interior surface with area @xmath115 .",
    "for such a boundary , eq . would give @xmath116 , failing to reproduce the black hole entropy .",
    "in section [ sec : gr ] , we derived the imaginary part of the gr action by a `` brute force '' evaluation of the boundary integral in .",
    "some objections may be raised with regard to the naturalness of this procedure . in this section",
    ", we will attempt to address such objections , as well as to make contact with other possible evaluations of the action .    in the literature ,",
    "when ( non - null ) bounded regions are considered , the boundary s flip surfaces are often hidden in topological corners .",
    "examples include purely - spacelike and purely - timelike boundaries , as well as mixed - signature `` cylinders '' with spacelike bases and timelike sides , as in figure [ fig : mixed_boundary ] . for such boundaries ,",
    "it is tempting to simply add up the contributions from the spacelike or timelike smooth patches , without ever including the corner contributions .",
    "however , this recipe is not valid for two reasons .",
    "first , it was shown @xcite that the corner contributions are required for a variational principle where one keeps only the boundary metric fixed .",
    "second , the recipe does not extend well to smooth boundaries , as we will now discuss .",
    "consider a smooth boundary in 1 + 1d ( figure [ fig : angles_smooth_boundary ] ) . by the `` corner ignoring '' recipe , one would want to add up the boundary contributions from the spacelike and timelike patches , without integrating through the signature flips . now , since the boost angle diverges at the flips , these separate contributions are all divergent .",
    "we are thus _ forced _ to carry out the boundary integral through the flips , in order to regularize these divergences .",
    "the result is that the real infinities from the two sides of each flip cancel , at the cost of picking up an imaginary part .",
    "now , in @xcite , after asserting the necessity of corner terms , a recipe for the action is given which is precisely _ the real part _ of the action as understood in the present paper . in the language of section [ sec : gr : contour ] , this corresponds to taking the average of the two complex - conjugate contour integrals , instead of choosing one of them .",
    "when phrased in this way , it seems like a suspect procedure .",
    "indeed , quantum mechanics tells us that one should sum ( or average ) over the amplitudes @xmath46 for different configurations , but not over the actions @xmath117 themselves .",
    "in fact , the real action in @xcite is obtained not by any sort of integral through the flip surfaces ( though the integral _ is _ evaluated for corners that do nt involve signature flips ) .",
    "instead , it is arrived at by demanding a variational principle with fixed boundary metric .",
    "it is important to note that our imaginary part of the action has _ no effect _ on this variational principle .",
    "indeed , @xmath8 depends only on the areas of the flip surfaces , which are a property of the boundary metric . unlike the real parts of corner angles , the imaginary boost angles @xmath54 are constant , and one does nt have to worry about their variation .",
    "similarly , there is no contradiction between our complex action and a real hamiltonian .",
    "first , one must realize that for finite regions in lorentzian spacetime , the relation between the action and a hamiltonian formalism is somewhat subtle : we must first have a suitable notion of `` time evolution '' that would respect causality .",
    "the simplest way to arrange this is to consider as `` time slices '' a family of spacelike hypersurfaces with a shared codimension-2 boundary @xmath118 . under `` time evolution ''",
    ", the hypersurfaces deform into each other , leaving the intrinsic geometry of @xmath118 fixed .",

    "thus , under this sort of time evolution , @xmath8 is constant , i.e. the action s variation is _",
    "real_. this is consistent with the usual notion of a real hamiltonian .",

    "\\label{eq : tilde_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this combination is the just intrinsic codimension-2 riemann tensor of the flip surface @xmath118 .",
    "thus , eq . can be written as : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the codimension-2 lovelock density analogous to , with @xmath205 and @xmath206 in place of @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "plugging into eqs .",
    "- , we obtain the imaginary part of the lovelock action : @xmath209 as in section [ sec : gr : contour ] , the overall sign in is ultimately controlled by whether we bypass the pole in from above or from below .",
    "the choice should be made such that @xmath210 , so that quantum amplitudes @xmath46 do nt explode exponentially .",
    "assuming that the gr ( @xmath211 ) term dictates the sign of the entire sum , and assuming that @xmath133 is positive , the sign in should be plus .",
    "the @xmath211 term then reproduces the gr result .",
    "moreover , the sum then satisfies the relation with the entropy formula @xcite for lovelock gravity .",
    "in particular , we see that the assumption that a plus sign should be chosen in is equivalent to the positivity of the entropy formula .",
    "this is guaranteed to hold if the gr term in is much larger than the rest , which is always the case at sufficiently large distance scales .",
    "we stress that even with this stronger assumption , our calculation is non - stationary .",
    "the assumption implies that gradients are small with respect to the coupling ratios @xmath212 , while stationarity means that time gradients are small with respect to space gradients .",
    "finally , we note that the imaginary part depends only on the intrinsic metric of the flip surfaces .",
    "this means that as in gr , @xmath8 has no effect on the variational principle with fixed boundary metric ( section [ sec : compare ] ) .      for flip surfaces @xmath118 not associated with a corner , as in section [ sec : gr : smooth ] , a problem arises . in lovelock theories with @xmath213 , the boundary term can also give divergent contributions from terms that _ do nt _ include a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "these divergences arise from the negative powers @xmath214 of the normal s length in the @xmath215 terms . upon deforming the integration contour , these terms may lead to additional imaginary contributions to the action .",
    "such additional contributions to @xmath8 are undesirable for two reasons .",
    "first , they would spoil the beautiful result , which does nt depend on the shear / expansion tensors @xmath187 and @xmath188 of the two lightsheets orthogonal to @xmath118 ( we note , however , that the result still holds if the shear / expansion tensor @xmath187 vanishes on @xmath118 ) .",
    "second , unlike the contributions with a factor of @xmath61 , they can not be written universally as an integral over the boost angle . as a result , they would depend on the boundary s detailed shape in the neighborhood of @xmath118 .",
    "we propose that the solution to these problems is to always treat a flip surface as the limiting case of a corner . as discussed in section [ sec : gr : spacelike_timelike ] , this is possible because a fixed angle between a timelike and a spacelike vector ( with imaginary part @xmath95 ) can appear arbitrarily blunt , as the two vectors are boosted towards a null direction .",
    "in other words , by an infinitesimal deformation of the boundary , one can always turn a smooth signature flip into a corner .",
    "when this is done , the potentially divergent boundary - term contributions with no factors of @xmath61 vanish , due to the order of limits : although @xmath214 tends to infinity at the flip surface `` somewhere inside '' the corner , this divergence is always multiplied by the corner s strictly vanishing width .    with this understanding ,",
    "the result holds also for smooth boundaries .",
    "we note the subtle yet consistent use of limiting procedures involved . to evaluate the corner contributions from terms in @xmath134 with factors of @xmath61 , we treat corners as a limiting case of smooth curves . on the other hand , to eliminate extra imaginary contributions from terms in @xmath134 with _ no _ factors of @xmath61 , we treat",
    "smooth signature flips as a limiting case of corners .",
    "the formula extends straightforwardly to corners containing more than one signature flip . as in section",
    "[ sec : gr : spacelike_timelike ] , each corner contributes to @xmath8 according to the number of signature flips inside it , i.e. that would appear if one resolved the corner into a smooth curve . for the purely - spacelike and purely - timelike boundaries from section [ sec :",
    "gr : spacelike_timelike ] , each corner contains two flips .",
    "thus , for such boundaries , eq . reads : @xmath216 where we assume that the plus sign is chosen in , i.e. that is positive .    for purely - null boundaries , as in section [ sec : gr : null ] ,",
    "the key difficulty is to fix the locations of the flip surfaces in .",
    "we again imagine a path integral over the different possibilities .",
    "this picks out the choice that minimizes @xmath8 .",
    "while in gr we had a clean theorem about the area s monotonicity , no such theorem is known for the functional in lovelock gravity . to retain the gr conclusion that the flip surfaces should be placed at the tips",
    ", we must assume that the monotonicity of the sum as one travels along the boundary lightsheets is dictated by the @xmath211 term .",
    "as with the choice of sign in , this is guaranteed at sufficiently large distance scales , where the gr term dominates over the @xmath213 terms . in that case , @xmath8 is given by a variant of : @xmath217 with the factor of 2 arising from the two flips near each tip point . for lightsheets with a stationary intrinsic metric , i.e. zero shear and expansion , the remarks at the end of section [ sec : gr : null ] apply . in particular , since the integral in depends only on the flip surface s intrinsic metric , the location of the flip surface along the lightsheet does nt affect @xmath8 .",
    "a direct connection with the entropy of stationary black holes can be made as in section [ sec : gr : black_hole ] . with our assumptions on the sign and ( for null boundaries )",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath8 , we can apply eqs . - to the special boundaries in figure [ fig : kruskal ] .",
    "the sum over corners again yields a factor of 2 .",
    "the result reads : @xmath218 where the integral is over any horizon slice .",
    "this reproduces the entropy formula from @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied the imaginary part of the gravitational action in finite regions .",
    "this arose from the action s boundary term , with a crucial role played by signature flips .",
    "the imaginary action for arbitrary regions is closely related to the entropy formula , as in eq . .",
    "in the special case of stationary spacetimes , we identified a class of regions for which the imaginary action directly reproduces the black hole entropy .",
    "these results draw a new link between causality , black hole thermodynamics and the dynamics of gravity in finite regions .",
    "our emphasis on finite regions and non - stationarity may prove fruitful , since these two features are central in an accelerated - expansion cosmology .",
    "we performed the calculation for gr with minimally - coupled matter , as well as for lovelock gravity .",
    "the outcome of the lovelock calculation gives us confidence in the validity of the methods used .",
    "in particular , it s encouraging how the simple result , depending only on the intrinsic geometry of the flip surface , came about through some intricate cancellations .",
    "this raises the question of whether the result can be derived in a simpler manner .",
    "in particular , one would want to take advantage of the topological structure of the action terms , emphasized in @xcite .",
    "it seems that this is indeed possible , by drawing a relation with the euclidean result of @xcite ( i am grateful to the anonymous referee at jhep for pointing this out ) .",
    "the detailed argument will be presented in future work , together with other interrelations between the lorentzian and euclidean calculations .",
    "the general result also lends credence to as the correct non - stationary entropy formula for lovelock gravity .",
    "this agrees with the proposal @xcite for a non - stationary entropy in general gravitational theories .",
    "our result provides further motivation to look for an increase law for this quantity - an issue that we avoided by assuming that the gr term dominates . in this context , see the partial result @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "see the argument in @xcite about a possible decrease of the quantity in black hole mergers .",
    "an explicit argument linking our imaginary actions to entropy is still missing .",
    "if found , it would upgrade our non - stationary calculation of @xmath8 into a non - stationary derivation of gravitational entropy . on a related note ,",
    "it s not clear how to generalize our treatment of black holes ( sections [ sec : gr : black_hole],[sec : lovelock : black_hole ] ) outside the stationary case . for realistic , non - stationary black holes ,",
    "there is no bifurcate horizon .",
    "no analogues of the timelike or null boundaries from figure [ fig : kruskal ] are apparent .",
    "one _ can _ draw an analogue of the spacelike boundary from figure [ fig : kruskal](a ) .",
    "however , such a boundary would have just one horizon slice as its corner , giving @xmath219 instead of @xmath7 . on the whole ,",
    "the scheme presented in sections [ sec : gr : black_hole],[sec : lovelock : black_hole ] is too non - local for non - stationary black holes .",
    "a scheme more adapted to such spacetimes appears to exist , and will be reported separately .",
    "one possibility is that after all , there is no general concept of gravitational entropy .",
    "instead , there is just the imaginary part @xmath8 of the action .",
    "we know that this quantity obeys equations analogous to those for entropy , i.e. black hole thermodynamics .",
    "we are also quite certain that it describes an actual entropy in special cases - stationary black holes and ads / cft @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that that s all there is to it .",
    "we will now provide two speculative arguments in favor of this view .",
    "recall that through wald s construction @xcite , entropy is related to the flux of the noether potential of a diffeomorphism .",
    "consider a simpler quantity of this sort - the noether potential @xmath220 of the electromagnetic gauge group in einstein - maxwell theory . by the gauss law , the flux of this quantity through a codimension-2 surface measures the charge inside .",
    "but does its flux through a small surface element measure a charge _ density _ ?",
    "moreover , does its flux through a _ _ hyper__surface element measure a current density ?",
    "in general , the answer is negative , but not always .",
    "for instance , a stationary black hole horizon viewed from the outside is indistinguishable from a charged membrane , with charge and current densities given by the local flux of @xmath220 .",
    "moreover , in a certain quasi - stationary limit , these densities satisfy a conservation law and experience a lorentz force .",
    "this is part of the `` membrane paradigm '' of black hole hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "@xmath220 also describes a physical charge / current density when one of the system s dimensions is much shorter than any wavelengths in the other dimensions .",
    "for example , consider a plate capacitor with spacing @xmath221 between the plates and a charge density that varies over distances @xmath222 .",
    "then the flux of @xmath220 in perpendicular to the plates , i.e. the electric field , corresponds directly to the local charge density .",
    "another example is ads / cft . there ,",
    "the role of `` capacitor plates '' is played by the ads boundary , and the radial distance , though infinite , diverges much slower than any tangential wavelengths . as a result",
    ", the flux of @xmath220 at the boundary corresponds to a current density in the cft .    to sum up",
    ", the noether potential @xmath220 obeys the same equations as a current density on a hypersurface , and arguably _ is _ a current density for stationary black holes and in ads / cft .",
    "however , in general , einstein - maxwell theory does not have a concept of current on hypersurfaces .",
    "instead , there is just the noether potential .",
    "we propose that a similar situation may hold for the imaginary part of the action vs. gravitational entropy : the imaginary action is the general concept , which corresponds to an entropy only in special cases .    from another perspective , if one treats holography with full seriousness , the foundations of quantum mechanics become suspect .",
    "since finite regions can hold only a finite amount of information , one can not measure e.g. quantum probabilities with arbitrary precision .",
    "black holes , as well as positive-@xmath15 cosmology , are situations where we are confined to such a finite region .",
    "thus , the notions of hilbert space , unitarity , etc . may lose their sharp meanings .",
    "if this is the case , then the same can be said about entropy . in this view , the concept of gravitational entropy is much like bohr s electron orbits : it contains an important grain of truth , but it s formulated in a language which this very truth makes obsolete .",
    "the imaginary action may represent a step towards more appropriate concepts .",
