    "the field of quantum dots has been evolving under the busy attention of theorists and experimentalists alike for already almost 20 years by now.@xcite this amount of interest and the enthusiasm is due to the unique blend of technological advances and fundamental interest .",
    "a special role is assigned to the magnetic field as a versatile tool with which one can tune the electronic properties of the quantum dots . in particular , the application of a perpendicular magnetic field aids the wigner crystallization,@xcite the formation of strongly correlated many - body states@xcite and induces ground state multiplicity transitions.@xcite    from the theoretical side , the ` exact ' numerical diagonalization method@xcite is of profound importance as a reference for approximate treatments . with the presently available computing power",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to compute the electronic structure of few - electron quantum dots .",
    "however , this method also has sharp limitations since the numerical effort grows exponentially with the number of electrons .",
    "therefore , the construction , refinement and application of less demanding approximate approaches based on some enlightening or visualizing idea is of critical importance .    among such ideas is the successful introduction of quasiparticles that came to be known as _",
    "composite fermions_.@xcite this transformation reduces the initial problem to a much more tractable problem of non - interacting or , at least , weakly interacting particles .",
    "another fruitful idea is to gain insight from the classical picture .",
    "the electrons in a quantum dot can be viewed as classical particles vibrating around their equilibrium positions@xcite not unlike atoms in a molecule or a solid , while the molecule can rotate as a whole.@xcite these developments culminated in the formulation of the rotating electron molecule approach@xcite based on a classical visualization and successfully competing with the composite fermion model .    in the present work , we call attention to yet another manifestation of the classical nature of quantum dots in strong magnetic fields .",
    "namely , we concentrate on the critical magnetic fields , i.  e.  the field strengths at which the ground - state angular momentum of the dot switches between its two successive values . here , we found that these critical field values show a strikingly simple dependence on the effective coulomb coupling strength .",
    "we compare estimates extracted from an unsophisticated quasi - classical model with the exact - diagonalization results thereby demonstrating the viability of such essentially classical paradigms and presenting one more argument in their favor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the exact - diagonalization results indicating that the critical magnetic fields obey a simple power law . in sections iii and",
    "iv we introduce and solve a simple quasi - classical model , and compare its predictions to the exact results in sec .",
    "v. the paper ends with a concluding sec .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] the well - known energy spectrum of two electrons in a parabolic dot@xcite ( the zeeman energy is not included ) is plotted as a function of the perpendicular magnetic field strength @xmath1 .",
    "we work with dimensionless variables so that the system energy is measured in units of @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the characteristic frequency of the confinement potential , while the magnetic field strength is expressed as the ratio @xmath4 of the cyclotron frequency @xmath5 to the above - introduced confinement frequency .",
    "the relative importance of the electron - electron coulomb interaction is characterized by the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the characteristic dimension of the parabolic quantum dot , and @xmath8 is the bohr radius .",
    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to a relatively large ( i.  e.  strongly interacting ) dot of @xmath9 , and we include the magnetic fields up to @xmath10 and angular momenta up to @xmath11 .",
    "we observe that for positive magnetic fields the preferred values of the angular momentum are negative , however , for the sake of convenience we will henceforth use the symbol @xmath0 for its absolute values and dispense with the `` @xmath12 '' sign .",
    "the spectrum of a strongly interacting ( @xmath13 ) two - electron parabolic dot as a function of perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the lowest term of each angular momentum @xmath14 is shown .",
    "the zeeman energy is not included . at the critical fields @xmath15 the angular momentum switches from @xmath0 to @xmath16.,width=302 ]",
    "the most conspicuous feature of this spectrum is the presence of certain critical values @xmath15 at which the ground state of the quantum dot changes the absolute value of its total angular momentum from @xmath0 to @xmath16 .",
    "this feature is brought about by the electron - electron interaction and persists for any number of electrons in the dot .",
    "we performed exact numerical diagonalization for quantum dots containing @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 electrons ( see ref .",
    "for the description of the procedure ) and calculated the critical magnetic field values for various effective coulomb interaction strengths .",
    "for the two - electron quantum dot we included @xmath20 values up to @xmath21 , and for the case of three electrons in the dot the upper limit was set at @xmath22 .",
    "the case of four electrons is numerically more demanding and we restricted the calculation to values up to @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the effective electron - electron interaction strength can be easily tuned by varying the strength of the confinement potential , and consequently , the quantum dot size . in figs .",
    "[ fig2][fig4 ] these critical magnetic field values are shown in a double - logarithmic plot as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "we display the magnetic field range between @xmath24 ( that is , @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .     at the lower left corner and increasing in steps of @xmath28 at each consecutive boundary .",
    "note the monotonic decrease of inter - line distances with increasing @xmath20 and @xmath29.,width=302 ]     but now for three electrons .",
    "an additional phase boundary separating regions of angular momentum @xmath30 and @xmath31 that shows a different behavior is not shown .",
    "note that widths of some regions corresponding to more stable states are considerably larger.,width=302 ]     but now for four electrons .",
    "an additional phase boundary separating regions of angular momentum @xmath30 and @xmath32 that shows a different behavior is not included .",
    "the regions corresponding to more stable states are wider.,width=302 ]    notice that plotted in a a logarithmic scale these functions are nearly linear , besides the linearity is more pronounced for large momentum @xmath0 and large magnetic field values .",
    "this linearity of the above curves @xmath33 implies the simple power law dependence @xmath34 we expect that such a plain dependence is a consequence of the classical nature of the electron system in the quantum dot in the limit of a strong perpendicular magnetic field ( see e.  g.  ref . ) as we will show in the next section where a simple quasi - classical description is developed .",
    "we observe that the phase diagram corresponding to the two - electron quantum dot ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) is more regular that the two others , namely , the nearly - straight - line boundaries appear to be parallel and the widths of the consecutive regions are decreasing monotonically .",
    "in contrast , the plots pertaining to the cases of three ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) and four ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) electrons include some regions of considerably larger width which indicate an enhanced stability of the corresponding ground states .",
    "in particular , such regions correspond to the maximum density droplet states of angular momentum @xmath35 for three electrons and @xmath36 for four electrons .",
    "moreover , we see that at the lower right corner of figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ( three and four electrons , respectively ) corresponding to low magnetic fields and strong coulomb coupling there is a slight deviation from collinearity between neighboring lines . in the case of the four - electron dot",
    "the phase boundaries @xmath37 and @xmath38 even merge together indicating that for @xmath39 there is a direct transition from the state with @xmath32 into the state with @xmath40 .",
    "similar transitions where the angular momentum changes by @xmath41 were also found for higher values of angular momentum , namely , there are transitions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . these properties of the four - electron quantum dot were already pointed out and discussed in ref .  .",
    "as we will see shortly , the quasi - classical model will overlook the presence of such irregularities .",
    "we note that in each of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] an extra phase boundary is present at low magnetic fields which was omitted . these disregarded boundaries",
    " see fig .",
    "2(a ) of ref .   and fig .  3 of ref .   for phase diagrams of three- and four - electron systems , respectively",
    " display a different trend .",
    "they are of a purely quantum - mechanical nature and result from a specific distribution of particles among the low - energy levels of a quantum dot , i.  e.  they are effects that can not be reproduced in a classical model .",
    "the 2d @xmath44-electron system confined by a parabolic quantum dot and placed in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 is described by the following dimensionless schrdinger equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46\\right)^2    + r_n^2 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\sum_{n , m=1\\atop n < m}^{n}\\frac{\\lambda}{|\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}_m|}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the ground state energy of the state of fixed angular momentum @xmath0 as a function of coulomb coupling constant @xmath20 and the magnetic field @xmath29 @xmath47 solving the equation @xmath48 for @xmath29 will define the above - introduced critical magnetic field values @xmath15 corresponding to the angular momentum transitions from @xmath0 to @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known that in the strong magnetic field regime@xcite the electrons form a wigner crystal which for a system up to five electrons is just a ring of equidistantly placed electrons.@xcite    due to the rotational symmetry around the @xmath49-axis the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) commutes with the total angular momentum operator @xmath50 therefore , the simplest way to calculate the ground energy of the system is to exclude the magnetic field from the schrdinger equation ( [ schred ] ) by means of the transformation @xmath51 with the ensuing scaling of coordinates @xmath52 which enables to transform the initial problem into the equivalent problem @xmath53 with the hamiltonian @xmath54 without a magnetic field .",
    "the coupling constants and the eigenvalues of both problems are related as    [ rel ] @xmath55    here , we again used our earlier convention whence the symbol @xmath0 stands for the absolute value of the angular momentum . note that the eigenvalue @xmath56 indeed depends only on the absolute value of the angular momentum , and eq .",
    "( [ rel2 ] ) is written in accordance with our previous convention for @xmath0 .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ rel ] ) and ( [ enequ ] ) we arrive at the following equation @xmath57 which expresses the critical magnetic field values in terms of the reduced problem ( [ sredtrans ] ) .",
    "now we turn to the solution of the eigenvalue problem defined by eq .",
    "( [ sredtrans ] ) which involves two peculiar features .",
    "one is that we need to solve for a highly excited state with a large angular momentum @xmath0 that corresponds to the ground state of the original problem ( [ schred ] ) , and this fact complicates the solution .",
    "also , according to eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) , in the strong magnetic field limit eq .",
    "( [ sredtrans ] ) has to be solved for small values of the coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the solution must be attainable by means of some perturbative technique .    neglecting the electron - electron interaction term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamtrans ] ) we obtain the zero order equation . due to the rotational symmetry the following radial equation for the zero - order one - electron function",
    "can be written : @xmath59 here , the symbol @xmath60 stands for the single - electron angular momentum . as",
    "this angular momentum is large the eigenvalue can be estimated by approximating the effective potential @xmath61 by a parabolic potential in the vicinity of its minimum at @xmath62 here we disregard the first - derivative term in eq .",
    "( [ swf ] ) as its inclusion gives only negligible corrections in the @xmath63 limit .",
    "this leads to the following estimate for the one - electron energy @xmath64 and the total zero - order energy of all electrons in the dot becomes @xmath65    let us now estimate the characteristic energies of the two possible types of motion of the electrons : the radial vibrations and the motion of electrons along the ring .",
    "the energy of the radial vibrations can be obtained by expanding the effective potential at the equilibrium point @xmath66 .",
    "the second derivative of the potential @xmath67 is of order unity and does not depend on the orbital momentum @xmath60 .",
    "this fact enables us to disregard these vibrations as their energy is small in comparison to the zero order energy @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , these vibrations are the same for any orbital momentum @xmath0 ( they are not affected by the electron - electron interaction which is even smaller , i.  e.   @xmath69 ) , and thus they can be neglected when solving eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "the energy of the longitudinal electron excitations along the ring is even smaller .",
    "actually , in zero order approximation the electron state under consideration is degenerate with respect to these excitations since the same total energy of the electronic ring ( [ enzero ] ) can be constructed from various angular momentum distributions among individual electrons .",
    "thus , this angular motion is highly affected by the weak electron - electron interaction .",
    "the result of this effect is well - know : it leads to the wigner crystallization of the electrons along the ring .",
    "the first order correction to the eigenvalue @xmath70 is obtained by including the electron - electron interaction term , but calculated classically for the electrons positioned equidistantly on a ring of radius @xmath66 .",
    "this energy correction reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the coulomb energy of the equidistantly located electrons on the unit radius ring , in particular , @xmath73 then , combining eqs .",
    "( [ enzero ] ) and ( [ encor ] ) we obtain the final expression for the energy to first order in powers of @xmath58 @xmath74 inserting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , solving it to the lowest accuracy in @xmath75 powers , and taking the average of the difference of two inverse square roots we obtain the result @xmath76 finally , taking the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ depfin_a ] ) and comparing to eq .",
    "( [ power_a ] ) we extract the expressions for the coefficients @xmath77",
    "as a function of the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the quasi - classical ( qc ) treatment predicts a universal value @xmath78 for any number of electrons shown by the solid line .",
    "different symbols indicate the exact values of the coefficients for quantum dots containing @xmath17 to @xmath19 electrons .",
    "the two - electron result displays a monotonic behavior and is spline - approximated by the dotted line to guide the eye.,width=302 ]    the quasi - classical solution predicts a universal value for the power - law index @xmath78 independent of the number of electrons . the comparison with the exact diagonalization results is displayed in fig .  [ fig5 ] . as discussed above , in the four - electron dot we encountered two cases when a single @xmath41 transition occurs in place of expected two @xmath28 transitions in the whole considered range of @xmath20 and @xmath29 values . in these cases",
    "( namely , the transitions @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) we used the @xmath0-value corresponding to the average of the two expected @xmath28 transitions .    in general , the discrepancy with our analytical model is small as all results fall into a range between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . as expected , the deviation of the exact result from the quasi - classical limit rapidly decreases with increasing angular momentum @xmath0 , and already at @xmath81 the difference is less than @xmath82 .",
    "the exact results corresponding to the two - electron dot show a monotonous behavior as indicated by the dotted - line in fig .",
    "the reason is that the two - electron system in a parabolic dot possesses only one non - trivial degree of freedom as the centre - of - mass motion can be separated from the relative motion and is not excited in the ground state .",
    "in contrast , the internal motion of three- and four - electron dots involves more degrees of freedom and is more intricate .",
    "this results in a more complicated dependence of @xmath83 on the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , enhanced non - monotonicities are discernible in the vicinity of more stable maximum - density - droplet or `` magic '' states at @xmath35 and @xmath84 for three electrons and @xmath85 for four electrons .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the comparison for the coefficient @xmath86 . the quasi - classical model ( [ depfin_b ] )",
    "predicts a logarithmic dependence of @xmath86 on the angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "we see that for the two - electron system the correspondence is nearly perfect .     as a function of the angular momentum for the case of @xmath87 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 electrons in the dot .",
    "the full lines denote the quasi - classical ( qc ) result , and the symbols correspond to the results from exact - diagonalization.,width=302 ]    the behavior concerning three and four electrons is more complex . at low values of the angular momentum ( and thus low magnetic fields ) there are notable discrepancies between the these sets of results in fig .",
    "in particular , we observe wide `` gaps '' , i.  e.abrupt jumps in the @xmath86 values obtained from the exact - diagonalization at angular momenta @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) corresponding to maximum density droplet states in three ( four ) electron systems .",
    "nevertheless , the overall trend of these dependences still follows the quasi - classical prediction rather closely , and the discrepancy between the classical and fully quantum mechanical results vanishes very quickly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a quasi - classical theory of the magnetic properties of few - electron quantum dots whose main result is a simple power law dependence of the critical magnetic fields on the coulomb coupling constant .",
    "while the main virtue of this theory lies in its relative simplicity and ability to provide results without resorting to heavy computation , the comparison of its predictions to the exact results also proves its robustness even in the realm of quantum mechanics .",
