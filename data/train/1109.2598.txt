    "non - perturbative aspects beyond perturbative string theory still remain some of the missing pieces in our current understanding of string theory . in early study in the 90s , the following question about non - perturbative string theory",
    "was investigated : _ what is the form of non - perturbative corrections to the perturbative expansions of string theory ? _ among various investigations , non - critical string theory @xcite played an important role since it is non - perturbatively formulated by solvable matrix models @xcite and this fact makes it possible to see higher - order behavior of the string - theory free energy in strong string coupling constant @xmath13 @xcite . in particular , it was found that non - perturbative corrections to the perturbative amplitudes are given by order of @xmath14 , i.e.  open - string degree of freedom @xcite : @xmath15   + o(\\theta_i^2)}_{\\text{\\footnotesize non - perturb .",
    "corrections } } ,   \\label{perturbexpansionintro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this fact lead to a key idea of d - branes @xcite .",
    "the identification of d - branes was then confirmed in comparison between the liouville - theory calculation @xcite , i.e.  zz - branes @xcite , and succeeding calculations of matrix models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "since they describe non - perturbative corrections in the perturbative asymptotic expansion , the relative weight factors @xmath16 , called _ d - instanton chemical potentials ( fugacities ) _ , remain to be ambiguous parameters in perturbative string theory @xcite .",
    "a basic origin of the ambiguity is the fact that these parameters are subjected to discrete corrections in various analytic continuations of string - theory backgrounds and that the formal expansions of analytic equations can be performed without specifying the direction from which we expand the series ( see figure [ figurestokes ] ) . from the viewpoint of physics ,",
    "this kind of phenomena make it possible to describe various different perturbative backgrounds in a single analytic theory .",
    "mathematically these behaviors are known as _ stokes phenomena _ , a basic analytic property in the asymptotic analysis .",

    "( [ perturbexpansionintro ] ) , ( i.e.  how the fugacities @xmath16 jump in analytic continuations ) can be performed by resurgent analysis of the perturbative asymptotic expansion eq .",
    "( [ perturbexpansionintro ] ) , which was analyzed recently @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - perturbative ambiguities are information completely out of the asymptotic expansions , and therefore we have to come back to the original definition of matrix models and need to see _ additional principle _ in order to determine the d - instanton fugacities in string theory .",
    "this is the question we investigate in this paper : _ what is the principle to choose physical d - instanton fugacities ?",
    "_ a reason why we consider these non - perturbative problems so significant is because we believe that it is this principle which binds various string - theory vacua together to formulate non - perturbatively completed string theory and consequently which guarantees the string dualities in a consistent way .",
    "therefore , this would be the direction in which we can quantitatively tackle the string - theory landscape from the first principle .     depending on from which direction of the string coupling @xmath17 we expand the free energy ( or partition function ) .",
    "that is , in this figure , there are eight different sets of the d - instanton fugacities @xmath18 depending on the angular domains of the string coupling @xmath19 .",
    "this mathematical property is called stokes phenomenon . therefore",
    ", determining stokes phenomena means determining how the fugacities jump in analytic continuations crossing the domain wall ( e.g.  @xmath20 in crossing the positive real axes ) . depending on the relative magnitude of perturbative free energy @xmath21 and the d - instanton fugacities , various perturbative string theories emerge as a dominant saddle point .",
    "this kind of phenomena can occur in any analytic continuations of the string - theory moduli spaces . ]",
    "( 190,0)(0,0 ) ( 20,62)@xmath22 $ ]    in study of this issue about the non - perturbative ambiguity , non - critical string theory is again expected to play an important rule . in non - critical string theory , the non - perturbative ambiguities are identified as integration constants of string equations @xcite . at the first sight , therefore it may seem plausible to say that the d - instanton fugacities are arbitrary free parameters in the non - perturbative theory . however , it is also true that there are several systems which prefer `` physical values '' rather than arbitrary values @xcite , and these physical values are implied in the matrix models .",
    "this kind of study has been investigated from various viewpoints @xcite . in this paper , succeeding the previous study of the authors @xcite , we investigate this issue in the framework of the multi - cut two - matrix models @xcite@xcite .",
    "the multi - cut two - matrix models are the two - matrix version of the multi - cut one - matrix models @xcite and realize the multi - cut critical points which naturally extend the two - cut critical points of the matrix models @xcite . in particular , these critical points are controlled by multi - component kp hierarchy @xcite and this fact makes possible various quantitative analysis of the matrix models @xcite .",
    "what is more , the two - cut critical points were found to describe minimal type 0 superstring theory @xcite , and , as an extension of this , a special kind of the multi - cut critical points ( which is also shown in section [ subsubsectiontwocriticalpoints ] ) were proposed to describe minimal fractional superstring theory ( or minimal parafermionic string theory ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting new feature found by quantitative analyses of these critical points is the fact that these multi - cut systems generally include a number of perturbative vacua in its string - theory landscape @xcite and also include various perturbative string - theory sectors in its wavefunctions @xcite . in particular , the fractional - superstring critical points are found to describe a superposition of various minimal fractional superstring theories , and the chain of string theories is then interpreted as the extra dimension of the non - critical m theory @xcite .",
    "this means that , in the case of an infinite number of cuts , there naturally appears a three - dimensional universal strong - coupling dual theory which realizes the philosophy proposed by hoava - keeler for the non - critical m theory @xcite . in this way",
    ", various new non - perturbative phenomena of string theory were revealed in the multi - cut critical points , and importantly these phenomena are fully described only after we determine the non - perturbative ambiguities , i.e.  they are governed by the information out of the perturbative description of string theory .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the multi - cut matrix models provide a fruitful field in studying this issue , and the investigation of this system is expected to answer to the following question : _ what is the non - perturbative completion of string theory ? _    as a natural framework to study the ambiguity , we consider the isomonodromy description @xcite@xcite@xcite for the multi - cut critical points .",
    "mathematically , the system is a @xmath0 isomonodromy system with an irregular singularity of poincar index @xmath23 which corresponds to the @xmath3-cut multi - critical points @xmath24 in the multi - cut matrix models . in the isomonodromy study of matrix models , _ the d - instanton chemical potentials are mapped to stokes multipliers of the linear systems in the spectral parameter @xmath25 _",

    ", the riemann - hilbert procedure provides an integral expression of the string free energy @xmath26 which is given by the stokes multipliers of the ode systems .",
    "for instance in the case of the @xmath27-cut @xmath28 critical point , the rh integral is give by the stokes multipliers @xmath29 of the corresponding ode system as @xmath30 ^ 2 , \\qquad f(t)=\\sum_{n } s_{n,2,1 }    \\int_{\\mathcal k_n } \\frac{d\\lambda}{2\\pi i } \\",

    ", the information of the non - perturbative ambiguities is translated into _ the stokes data of ordinary differential equation ( ode ) systems _ as the information which does not depend on the direction of asymptotic expansion ( shown in figure [ figurestokes ] ) .",
    "( i.e.  @xmath32 for each angular domain @xmath33 in figure [ figurestokes ] ) can be expressed by the stokes data @xmath29 of the ode system of the painlev equations . ]",
    "although the stokes phenomena in these ode systems are relatively simpler than those of non - linear differential equation systems like painlev equations , less is known in the case of large values of @xmath3 and @xmath1 compared with the isomonodromy systems of the second order painlev series @xcite .    in the previous study of the authors @xcite , the physical constraints ( required from the matrix models ) on the stokes multipliers are formulated in this isomonodromy framework . as is reviewed in section [ subsubsectionmcgeometryandstokesphen ] ,",
    "the requirement is given as _ the boundary conditions for physical cuts in the spectral curves_. interestingly these physical constraints enable us to show explicit solutions of stokes multipliers which satisfy high - degree algebraic equations called monodromy free ( or cyclic ) conditions ( eq .  ( [ originalmonodromyfreecondition ] ) ) , which are generally quite hard to solve without any help of the physical boundary conditions .",
    "in this paper , on the other hand , we extend this boundary condition to wider classes of the multi - cut critical points ( general number of cuts , @xmath3 , and general poincar index , @xmath1 ) , especially the critical points which correspond to minimal fractional superstring ( or parafermionic string ) theory @xcite . a major difference from the critical points of the previous study is lack of the @xmath5-symmetry which is intrinsic in the multi - cut two - matrix models .",
    "therefore , the number of independent stokes multipliers are @xmath3 times more than that of @xmath5 symmetric critical points , and this becomes a huge predicament to direct analysis of the stokes phenomena .",
    "however , we will show that by this feature it becomes manifest that the multi - cut boundary conditions are equivalent to discrete hirota equations ( i.e.  t - systems ) of quantum integrable systems .",
    "that is , the physical section of d - instanton chemical potentials are expressed by quantum integrability which would be an integrable structure of strong - coupling dual description , i.e.  non - critical m theory .",

    "<S> investigation of this system is important for the purpose of figuring out the non - critical version of m theory which was proposed to be the strong - coupling dual of fractional superstring theory as a two - matrix model with an infinite number of cuts . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly the multi - cut boundary - condition recursion equations have a universal form among the various multi - cut critical points , and this enables us to show explicit solutions of stokes multipliers in quite wide classes of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although these critical points almost break the intrinsic @xmath5 symmetry of the multi - cut two - matrix models , this feature makes manifest a connection between the multi - cut boundary - condition recursion equations and the structures of quantum integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is uncovered that the stokes multipliers satisfy _ multiple _ hirota equations ( i.e.  _ multiple _ t - systems ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our result provides a large extension of the ode / im correspondence to the general isomonodromy ode systems endowed with the multi - cut boundary conditions . </S>",
