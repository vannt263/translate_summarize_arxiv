    "in recent years , the geometry of contact structures on three manifolds has been a subject of intensive studies . in particular , tight contact structures have been the focus of interest .",

    "the results in @xcite are some of the main ingredients in this paper . since the situation here is more complicated than in the case of simple singularities , we have to study rational curves with negative self - intersection numbers carefully .",
