    "the function @xmath9 is a degree @xmath3 polynomial with rational coefficients , called the _",
    "ehrhart polynomial _ of @xmath0 .",
    "hence one can think of the ehrhart polynomial as giving a map @xmath10 from @xmath5 to the polynomial ring @xmath11 $ ] .",
    ". formulas for the coefficients @xmath13 , in various settings and with varying degrees of generality , have been given by several authors @xcite .",
    "some coefficients are easy to understand , for example @xmath14 here @xmath15 is taken with respect to the measure that gives a fundamental domain of @xmath2 volume 1 ; if a polytope has dimension less than @xmath3 , we compute its volume with respect to the lattice obtained by intersecting its affine hull with @xmath2 . for a general lattice polytope ,",
    "expressions for the ehrhart coefficients involve not only volumes but also subtle arithmetic information , namely _ higher - dimensional dedekind sums _ as studied by carlitz and zagier @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the ehrhart polynomial depends not just on the combinatorial type of @xmath0 , but rather on the pair @xmath16 . hence it is natural to consider how @xmath1 changes as @xmath2 is varied .",
    "the theory of automorphic forms provides a powerful machine to accomplish this , namely the technique of _ hecke operators_.    thus let @xmath17 be a prime , and let @xmath18 be a positive integer . given a lattice polytope @xmath0 with ehrhart polynomial @xmath1",
    ", we define a new polynomial @xmath19 as follows .",
    "let @xmath20 be the canonical superlattice of @xmath2 of coindex @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath22 , and any lattice @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 determines a subspace @xmath25",
    ". let @xmath26 be the set of such lattices with @xmath27 .",
    "then we define @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the lattice polytope with vertices in @xmath23 canonically determined by @xmath0 .",
    "[ [ ss : nu.def ] ]    in this paper we consider the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath1 .",
    "to state our results , we require more notation . for any nonnegative integer @xmath31 , choose and fix an @xmath32-dimensional subspace @xmath33 of @xmath34 , and define @xmath35 note that this value is independent of the choice of @xmath33 .",
    "finally for any polynomial @xmath36 $ ] let @xmath37 be the coefficient of @xmath38 in @xmath39 .",
    "then our first result can be stated as follows :    [ thm : main1 ] we have @xmath40 independently of @xmath0 .",
    "the ratios @xmath41 satisfy @xmath42 moreover , for each triple @xmath43 , there is a polynomial with positive coefficients @xmath44,\\ ] ] independent of @xmath17 , such that @xmath45 .",
    "the sum can be viewed as a sum of @xmath17-powers over a certain geometrically - defined stratification of the finite grassmannian @xmath46 , and thus it is not surprising that for any given @xmath17 the quantity @xmath47 can be expressed as a integral polynomial in @xmath17 .",
    "however , the existence of @xmath48 , as well as the statement that it has positive coefficients , does not follow immediately from since the number of terms in the sum grows with @xmath17 and since the strata are only locally closed .    as an example of theorem [ thm : main1 ] , if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 for any @xmath0 .",
    "hence the ratio on the left of is the number of terms in .",
    "it is well known that this is the cardinality of @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : cosets ] ) , which equals @xmath51 . for further examples , table [ tab : ev ] shows the hecke eigenvalues that arise for the ehrhart coefficients of @xmath52-dimensional polytopes .",
    ".[tab : ev]eigenvalues for @xmath53 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     four superlattices giving a nonzero @xmath54 . ]",
    "computing @xmath55 on @xmath56 . ]",
    "[ [ section-23 ] ]      suppose @xmath59 is a finite set superlattices of @xmath2 of finite coindex",
    ". we can define the average regularized ehrhart polynomial of @xmath0 with respect to the family @xmath59 by @xmath60 our goal in this section is to show how theorem [ thm : main1 ] can be used to derive limiting formulas for @xmath61 as @xmath59 ranges over families of superlattices satisfying certain arithmetical conditions .      as a first example , fix a prime @xmath17 , and suppose @xmath62 consists of all superlattices of @xmath2 of coindex @xmath17 .",
    "then by definition @xmath63 by lemma [ lem : count.arg ] , we have @xmath64 this implies the following result :        we can use the relations in the hecke algebra to derive similar results for more general sets of superlattices . let @xmath66 be the operator @xmath67 at the prime @xmath17 , and write @xmath68 for the operator that associates to any lattice @xmath2 the set of superlattices of coindex @xmath69 .",
    "suppose @xmath69 has prime factorization @xmath70 .",
    "then , in the algebra @xmath71 generated by the @xmath66 as @xmath17 ranges over all primes @xmath17 , we have ( * ? ? ?",
