    "nuclei are fundamental pieces of building up galaxies , the earth , and all the creatures and materials around us .",
    "a nucleus consists of neutrons and protons , and the specie of chemical element is identified by the number of protons contained in a nucleus , where the same chemical elements with the different neutron numbers are called isotopes .",
    "the synthesis of certain chemical elements from the other chemical elements has not been industrially realized in factories so far , but naturally taking place in the universe ( e.g. , in the core of stars ) . in those sites low - energy ( heavy-)ion reactions , which includes several types of reactions such as fusion , fragmentation , fission , and inelastic scattering , give rise to the synthesis of chemical elements .",
    "it is worth noting that the typical incident energy of producing chemical elements is as much as a few mev per nucleon , where the neutron and the proton are collectively called the nucleon .",
    "soliton is a concept arising from the nonlinearity and the dispersive property ( for the general argument about soliton , see textbooks such as @xcite ) , where the dispersive property is represented by @xmath0 for the angular frequency @xmath1 , the wave number @xmath2 , and a constant @xmath3 . in the literature of soliton research ( for a milestone , see @xcite ) , the stably propagating wavepacket is called solitary wave , and such a solitary wave is called soliton if its essential properties such as mass and momentum distributions are conserved throughout the time evolution ( even after the collisions ) .",
    "a wide appearance of soliton regardless of the size of the system has been known , which suggests the underlying mathematically universal property .",
    "while soliton were historically studied in many complex systems such as shallow water wave described by kdv equation @xcite , the preceding soliton studies associated with the ion collisions ( including nuclear fusion reaction ) are quite limited .",
    "indeed , although the soliton in heavy - ion reactions was studied in raha - weiner  @xcite with paying attention to the momentum transparency , the suppression mechanism of soliton in ion collisions has been an open problem . in particular theoretical research taking into account realistic conditions like three - dimensional motion",
    "is claimed to be desired in ref .",
    "note that the theoretical soliton studies on the sub - atomic physics are rather actively developed in the field of the particle physics and the hadron physics , but those energies are too high to have something to do with the synthesis of chemical elements .    in this paper , based on the three - dimensional density functional theory ( tddft ) ,",
    "the appearance of soliton in sub - atomic reaction process on the scale of 10@xmath4  m is studied .",
    "the appearance of soliton suggests the actual influence of a certain kind of nonlinearity in the synthesis of chemical elements , while the appearance of fusion is exactly the contour example for the stable existence of soliton .",
    "consequently , the answer to the question  can nuclei ( many - nucleon systems ) be solitons ? \"",
    "is presented .",
    "for the synthesis of chemical elements , we take collisions between two helium isotopes : @xmath5 where @xmath6he consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons , and @xmath7he consists of 2 protons and 6 neutrons .",
    "although there should be a neutron - rich situation for the existence of @xmath7he , this reaction can take place in helium - abundant stars .",
    "even restricted to the collision shown in eq .  , there should be several types of reactions such as fusion , fragment , fission , and inelastic scattering . a wide variety of reactions",
    "are realized by setting different initial conditions : the incident energy and the impact parameter .",
    "if fusion appears , the final product is @xmath8be including 4 protons and 8 neutrons . if reactions other than fusion appears , fragments smaller than @xmath8be can be produced . that is , hydrogen ( proton number=@xmath9 ) , helium ( proton number=@xmath10 ) , lithium ( proton number=@xmath11 ) , and beryllium ( proton number=@xmath12 ) isotopes are possible to be produced through this reaction .",
    "one of the most reliable frameworks of describing low - energy ( heavy-)ion collisions is the nuclear time - dependent density functional theory @xcite . in case of eq .",
    ", the non - stationary problem is written by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes single nucleon wave function ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , the index @xmath17 identifies protons ( @xmath18 - 1/2 ) and neutrons ( @xmath18 + 1/2 ) , and @xmath19 is the effective hamiltonian operator @xmath20 which consists of the kinetic part @xmath21 and the potential part @xmath22 .",
    "equation   is a nonlinear equation holding the dispersive property ( @xmath0 ) in which the single - nucleon degrees of freedom are fully taken into account .",
    "spin degree of freedom is also taken into account , although it is not explicitly shown .",
    "the stationary problem is written by @xmath23 where the condition @xmath24 is additionally imposed to eq .  .",
    ".coefficient values of the sv - bas interaction parameter set @xcite .",
    "this parameter set is recently introduced in terms of obtaining a good description of the giant resonances in @xmath25pb . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ table3 ]    as the amount of momentum - transparency has been claimed to be so small in ion reactions @xcite , one of the purpose of this paper is to find out the reason why the momentum transparency is small .",
    "the total transparency rate including the mass - transparency and the momentum - transparency is defined by @xmath26 the total transparency is detected if @xmath27 is equal to 1 . as a criterion in this paper , rather pure soliton existence",
    "is suggested if @xmath28 , where the amplitude of the contained amount of soliton component is estimated by the value @xmath29 .",
    "this criterion is only a necessary condition for the soliton existence , because it does not say nothing about the shape .",
    "energy - dependence of the total transparency rate , the charge equilibration rate and the reaction time are compared in fig .",
    "first , the significant charge equilibration is notice only for the lower energy cases ( @xmath30  mev ) .",
    "second , the soliton is suggested to exist in relatively high energy collision ( around @xmath31=30  mev ) at which the charge equilibration rate has a minimum value with respect to the energy .",
    "such a correspondence implies that the appearance of charge equilibration is the primary factor of the soliton suppression .",
    "third , more charge equilibration does not necessarily result in the suppression of soliton ( see very high mass - transparency of protons at @xmath32  mev shown in table  [ table2 ] even under the appearance of charge equilibration ) . forth",
    ", less reaction time can not be the ultimate factor of the soliton appearance ( see @xmath33  mev case ) even though much reaction time is naively expected to bring about more interaction between the solitary waves .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath29 is almost equal to 0.25 for the reaction time 0.2@xmath34  s ( @xmath35  mev ) , while @xmath29 is roughly equal to @xmath36 for the reaction time 0.35@xmath34  s ( @xmath32  mev ) .",
    "fifth , we found out that the energy - dependence of the total transparency has a clear logarithmic dependence .    , the charge equilibration rate @xmath37 and the reaction time is shown for svb11111 interaction , where the total transparency rate at @xmath38  mev is equal to 0.0 .",
    "the reaction time , which means the duration time interval of the reaction , is estimated by eq .  .",
    "the horizontal axis is plotted using the logarithmic scale .",
    "the left and right vertical axes are for the total transparency rate and the charge equilibration rate , respectively .",
    "there is no axis for the reaction time , and values are shown besides the curve on three points , instead .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=359 ] [ fig7 ]",
    "based on a systematic three - dimensional time - dependent density functional calculation , the existence of soliton has been studied in ion collisions yielding several kinds of light chemical elements . the contained amount of soliton component has been confirmed to be energy - dependent . in this sense nuclei",
    "can be solitons conditionally .",
    "indeed , the existence energy region of soliton is suggested to be located around the several 10  mev per nucleon in the center - of - mass frame , where the reduced incident energy @xmath31 gives an approximation to the center - of - mass energy per nucleon of the total colliding system . as a result",
    "the existence of nuclear transparent incident energy ( nuclear transparent temperature ) , at which the reaction cross section is almost equal to zero , is proposed .",
    "this is nothing but a nonlinear effect , which must be important to understand the structure of the celestial bodies such as stars and neutron stars .    the fast wave realizing the fast charge equilibration is the primary factor of the soliton suppression ; the soliton is hindered if the incident energy is less than the upper - limit energy of the fast charge equilibration ( @xmath39mev in this case  @xcite ) .",
    "however charge equilibration does not necessarily suppress the soliton wave .",
    "indeed , protons have perfect mass - transparency ( @xmath40 ) in case of @xmath41  mev ( see cases of svb11010 and svb11011 interactions in table  [ table2 ] ) , which can not be explained without taking into account the charge equilibration dynamics exchanging only neutrons . as a result a new concept of the cooperative co - existence of soliton propagation and charge equilibration is proposed .",
    "a motivation of this paper is , with respect to the synthesis of chemical elements , to identify the origin of soliton suppression in the components of the effective nuclear force .",
    "first of all , less reaction time of the two colliding solitary waves does not necessarily lead to the enhancement of soliton existence .",
    "the larger force - dependence of the soliton existence can be found in the momentum - transparency than in the mass - transparency . in this context",
    "the spin - orbit force , whose origin is the special relativity effect , plays a crucial role ( compare svb11111 and svb11110 in case of @xmath41  mev shown in table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "rather pure soliton wave is generated by the momentum independent part of the nuclear force ( compare svb11111 and svb11011 in case of @xmath41  mev shown in table  [ table3 ] ) , but it is contaminated by the momentum dependent parts including the spin - orbit force .",
    "note that the spin - orbit force was shown to increase the charge equilibration ( rate ) by increasing the spin polarization  @xcite . as a result",
    "the momentum exchange has been confirmed to be crucial to the suppression of soliton .",
    "finally it is worth while to refer to two effects , which are not taken into account in this paper . in the higher energies the collision between nucleon , which gives rise to the effect similar to the friction ,",
    "is expected to appear and to break the unitary time evolution .",
    "nucleon - nucleon collisions are negligible for ion collisions with lower energies ( @xmath30  mev ) at least , because mean free path of nucleons in the nuclear matter is calculated to be larger than 20  fm if the energy is less than the fermi energy  @xcite ( the corresponding @xmath31 is roughly equal to be 10  mev based on the calculation method shown in @xcite ) .",
    "another effect is the special relativity effect , which is effectively taken into account in the force parameterization including the spin - orbit force even in our non - relativistic framework , but it is believed to be more correctly treated when the amplitude of the relative velocity of the collision is larger than @xmath42 ( for the theoretical study dealing with ion reactions with high energies , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "charge equilibration rate and the high total transparency rate at @xmath43  mev in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] should be affected by these two effects .",
