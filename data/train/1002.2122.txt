    "the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) plays a key role in modern condensed - matter theory .",
    "it consists of a set of electrons moving in a uniform , inert , neutralizing background , and is the simplest fully - interacting quantum many - body model of condensed matter .",
    "the three - dimensional heg models the behavior of the conduction electrons in metals and semiconductors , while the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heg models the behavior of electrons confined to surfaces and thin layers .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite have long played an important role in establishing the ground - state properties of the heg .",
    "most effort has gone into calculating the ground - state energy of different phases as a function of density , in order to establish the zero - temperature phase diagram.@xcite in this article , we report qmc calculations of some other properties of the 2d heg of interest to condensed - matter physicists : the pair correlation function ( pcf ) , static structure factor ( ssf ) , and momentum density ( md ) . we also report energy data for high - density heg s . we have confined our attention to the fluid phase , which is the ground state at the densities typically encountered in experiments .    the pcf , especially the contact pcf @xmath0 , is a key ingredient in generalized - gradient - approximation exchange - correlation functionals for density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the pcf has been studied several times using qmc,@xcite but the value of @xmath0 at low densities has proved controversial because electrons approach one another infrequently , and the qmc results disagree with values calculated using ladder theory.@xcite our qmc data , obtained using a different trial wave function from the earlier calculations , should help to clarify the situation .",
    "the ssf is related to the pcf by a fourier transform .",
    "ssf data at small @xmath1 are needed to establish the long - range behavior of the pcf .",
    "the md of the heg is of considerable importance in fermi liquid theory . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only qmc md data to have been published for the 2d heg are those of tanatar and ceperley,@xcite which used a relatively simple form of trial wave function .",
    "( a fit to qmc data generated by conti@xcite is reported in ref . , but no details about the calculations are given . ) tanatar and ceperley s low - density md shows a very strange feature : the md is lower at zero momentum than it is at the top of the fermi edge .",
    "it is clearly important to provide new qmc md data , in order to establish whether this is a genuine property of the heg .    finally , we report ground - state energy data for paramagnetic fermi fluids , which we use to parameterize a local - density - approximation exchange - correlation functional for use in dft studies of 2d systems .",
    "the rest of this article is arranged as follows . in sec.[sec : qmc_calcs ] we describe the computational techniques used . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the data we have generated . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec .  [",

    "densities are given in terms of the radius @xmath2 of the circle that contains one electron on average .",
    "we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath3 ) throughout this article .",
    "all our qmc calculations were performed using the casino code.@xcite",
    "in the variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) method , expectation values are calculated with respect to an approximate trial wave function , the integrals being performed by a monte carlo technique . in diffusion quantum monte carlo@xcite ( dmc ) the imaginary - time schrdinger equation is used to evolve an ensemble of electronic configurations towards the ground state . the fermionic symmetry is maintained by the fixed - node approximation,@xcite in which the nodal surface of the wave function is constrained to equal that of a trial wave function .",
    "the vmc algorithm generates electron configurations distributed according to the square of the trial wave function , while the dmc algorithm generates configurations distributed as the product of the trial wave function and its ground - state component .",
    "our trial wave functions consisted of slater determinants of plane - wave orbitals multiplied by a jastrow correlation factor .",
    "the jastrow factor contained polynomial and plane - wave expansions in electron - electron separation.@xcite the orbitals in the slater wave function were evaluated at quasiparticle coordinates related to the actual electron positions by backflow functions consisting of polynomial expansions in electron - electron separation.@xcite the wave functions were optimized by variance minimization@xcite and linear - least - squares energy minimization.@xcite    we simulated heg s in finite , square cells subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the many - body bloch theorem@xcite states that the wave function @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a simulation - cell lattice vector and @xmath7 is the simulation - cell bloch vector . in some of our calculations , and in previous qmc studies of the 2d heg,@xcite",
    "it has been assumed that @xmath8 .",
    "however , in our calculations of the energy , pcf , and ssf we performed twist averaging , in which expectation values are averaged over @xmath9 in the first brillouin zone of the simulation cell.@xcite this procedure greatly reduces single - particle finite - size errors caused by shell - filling effects .",
    "the high quality of our trial wave functions is demonstrated in table [ table : wf_quality_rs5 ] , which shows qmc energies achieved using different levels of wave function for a 58-electron paramagnetic fermi fluid of density parameter @xmath10 a.u .",
    "backflow functions change the nodal surface of the trial wave function and can therefore improve the fixed - node dmc energy . in practice",
    "we find that backflow lowers the dmc energy substantially .",
    "our vmc energies are significantly lower than those of kwon _",
    "et al._,@xcite as is our slater - jastrow - backflow dmc energy . on the other hand , the slater - jastrow - backflow dmc energy of attaccalite _ _",

    "our slater - jastrow dmc energy is slightly lower than that of attaccalite _ et al .",

    "_ since the nodal surface is the same in the three calculations , these dmc energies really ought to agree . however , the trial wave function used by kwon _ et al . _",
    "is very much poorer than ours , as can be seen by comparing the vmc energies .",
    "time - step and population - control biases in their dmc energies must be much greater , which may explain the discrepancy .",
