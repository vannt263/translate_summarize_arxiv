    "over the last decades , our understanding of cosmological reionization has improved considerably .",
    "observations of high - redshift quasars clearly indicate that reionization must end around @xmath5 @xcite , and the wmap 5-year - measurement finds a reionization optical depth of @xmath6 @xcite , yielding clear evidence that reionization started significantly earlier and is thus a continuous process .",
    "reionization through miniquasars would produce a soft - x - ray background that is significantly higher than the observed background , and can thus be ruled out @xcite .",
    "simulations of stellar reionization further show that the process is highly inhomogeneous and based on the growth and merging of ionized bubbles around the first stellar sources @xcite . understanding the essential physical processes , it is possible to build semi - analytic models that describe stellar reionization , which can be tested over a wide parameter space @xcite .",
    "additional constraints on the cosmic star formation rate are now available from gamma - ray burst observations @xcite .",
    "the reionization framework thus provides an increasingly reliable test for the stellar population during reionization and can be used to constrain global physical conditions in the early universe .",
    "+   + regarding the stellar population , the works @xcite and @xcite suggest that the first stars were top - heavy with a peak in the imf at around @xmath7 . on the contrary , @xcite and @xcite indicate that gas especially in more massive systems can fragment because of dips in the equation of state , which may lead to the formation of a stellar cluster .",
    "it was shown that cooling in previously ionized gas is enhanced and leads to typical stellar masses of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it was further suggested that the presence of weak magnetic fields is sufficient to lead to a more present - day like mode of star formation , resulting in considerably lower masses @xcite .",
    "recently , a new phase of stellar evolution was suggested in which the stars would be powered by dark matter annihilation instead of nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "various follow - up works have explored such a scenarios in more detail .",
    "studies by @xcite explored the main - sequence and pre - main - sequence phase of dark stars , and other works calculated the effect of dark matter capture by off - scattering from baryons @xcite .",
    "while many predictions are still model - dependent , it has often been suggested that such stars may have typical masses of @xmath9 , giving rise to a very bright main - sequence phase , or may have much longer lifetimes due to modifications in the stellar evolution . in the end , all these suggestions must face the constraint that the stellar population must be able to provide the correct reionization optical depth .",
    "+   + complications may arise through the presence of additional physics that are often not considered in standard reionization calculations and simulations on the first stars .",
    "such possibilities include the presence of primordial magnetic fields , dark matter decay and dark matter annihilation .",

    "they are found in the interstellar gas as well as in the intergalactic medium @xcite , but their origin is still unclear .",
    "there is a viable possibility that these fields have a primordial origin @xcite . so far , the most stringent constraints on the strength of these putative fields come from the measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) calculations",
    ". a homogeneous magnetic field would produce temperature anisotropies in the cmbr  @xcite whose maximal amplitudes are limited by the cobe satellite measurements which in turn limit the field strength , as measured today , to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the presence of any primordial field would also alter the cmbr power spectrum by changing the characteristic velocities . with the sensitivity of the planck satellite one should be able to detect fields with present day strength of @xmath11  @xcite .",

    "strong magnetic fields in the early universe can also change the abundance of relic @xmath12he and other light elements during the big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite . to comply with observational limits on light element",
    "abundances these primordial fields must not exceed @xmath13 at the time when the universe was @xmath14 which corresponds to a present day field @xmath15@xcite .",
    "effects of primordial magnetic fields have already been considered in @xcite , finding that density perturbations can be enhanced by the lorentz force from tangled magnetic fields .",
    "both the evolution of perturbations in the presence of magnetic fields as well as their effect on the thermodynamics via ambipolar diffusion heating and decaying mhd turbulence was considered in @xcite .",
    "recent calculations of @xcite show that the enhancement of structure due to magnetic fields is pronounced at about @xmath16 , but becomes less effective on larger mass scales and appears as a subdominant contribution on the scale of the magnetic jeans mass .",
    "consequences for @xmath17 cm observations have been explored as well @xcite . in this work",
    ", we examine the consequences for reionization in more detail and calculate the backreaction on structure formation according to the work of @xcite .",
    "the wmap 5 year data @xcite have measured the thomson scattering optical depth from reionization and allow to constrain different reionization scenarios in the early universe .",

    "the thermal and ionization history of the igm between recombination and the end of reionization is determined by a number of different processes . at redshifts @xmath19 , compton scattering of cmb photons couples the gas temperature @xmath20 to the cmb temperature @xmath21 . at lower redshifts ,",
    "this coupling is less efficient and the gas decouples from the cmb due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "this standard scenario can be altered if additional energy injection mechanisms are present .",
    "additional heat input can lead to an earlier redshift of decoupling , whereas an increase in the ionized fraction , for instance due to secondary ionization from the decay or annihilation products of dark matter , tends to make compton cooling more efficient .",
    "once structure formation sets in , the thermal and ionization history is further influenced from x - rays produced in star forming regions and uv photons that escape from the first galaxies .",

    "we assume a stellar mass distribution similar to the local imf in the galactic halo @xcite with a metallicity of @xmath126 of the solar value .",

    "a new phase of stellar evolution was suggested in @xcite , in which stars are not powered by nuclear fusion , but by annihilating dark matter within them .",
    "these stars could reach masses of up to @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "once dark matter annihilation becomes ineffective and such stars enter the main sequence phase , they would thus be extremely bright sources of uv photons .",
    "the consequences of such a phase are discussed below .",
    "further models taking into account a dark matter capturing phase have been suggested as well @xcite .",
    "as they are highly parameter - dependent , we study them in a separate work @xcite .",
    "the energy of the annihilation products can be deposited into heating , ionization and collisional excitation .",
    "the latter is quickly radiated away , but may contribute to the build - up of a lyman @xmath28 background that helps to couple the spin temperature of hydrogen to the gas temperature , which may be relevant for @xmath17 cm observations @xcite . for given models of dark matter ,",
    "it is possible to work out the detailed absorbed fractions as a function of redshift @xcite . in this work , however , we adopt the more generic approach of @xcite . for definiteness , they assume that the dark matter particles annihilate to high - energy photons , which allows to determine the energy fractions going into heat and ionization by the fitting formulae of @xcite . as they show , heating by dark matter annihilation is accompanied also by a significant increase in the electron fraction due to secondary ionization . for other models of dark matter annihilation",
    ", the results can be rescaled by appropriate absorption efficiencies . to eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) describing the temperature evolution , we thus add a term @xmath166 according to @xcite , where @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath37 is the helium fraction by number , @xmath169 is the fraction of energy going into heating ( see * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath170 the effective baryon - normalized `` lifetime '' , given as @xmath171 here , @xmath172 and @xmath173 denote the cosmological parameters for dark and baryonic matter , @xmath174 is the critical density at redshift zero , @xmath175 is the dark matter particle mass and @xmath176 the velocity - averaged cross section . in the same way",
    ", we add a term to eq .",
    "( [ ion ] ) that describes the evolution of the ionized fraction : @xmath177 where @xmath178 ev is the hydrogen ionization threshold and @xmath179 the fraction of the energy going into ionization , for which we use the fitting formulae of @xcite . as the decay rate scales with the dark matter density squared",
    ", it is most efficient at early times and may thus modify the recombination history , which allows to place upper limits on the dark matter annihilation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the wmap 1-year - data yield an upper limit of @xmath180 where @xmath181 corresponds to the energy fraction actually absorbed into the igm and is of order 1 for particle masses in the mev range @xcite .      in a similar way , dark matter decay can alter the thermal and ionization history of the universe .",
    "the lifetimes of dark matter particles considered here will be considerably larger than the age of the universe to ensure that the abundance of dark matter does not change significantly .",
    "still , the conversion of particle mass to thermal energy can have an important impact on the thermal evolution of the universe @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "the decay rate is constant over time and the effect at lower redshifts is more pronounced compared to the case of dark matter annihilation . to calculate the heating and ionization rate , the same formalism can be employed as for dark matter annihilation , but we adopt the baryon - normalized decay rate @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the lifetime of the dark matter particle . based on the modified recombination and reionization histories in the presence of dark matter decay , it was shown that @xcite @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the fraction of the particle mass - energy released through decay and @xmath181 the fraction of the released energy deposited into the igm .",
    "if data of large - scale surveys are included , the constraint can be slightly improved , yielding @xmath186      dark stars have been suggested as a possible consequence of dark matter annihilation in the early universe @xcite . if indeed the first stars form in the central peaks of the dark matter distribution in the early minihaloes , they might be powered by dark matter annihilation instead of nuclear fusion .",
    "such stars could have up to @xmath165 and surface temperatures in the range of @xmath187 k , i. e. significantly colder than conventional pop .",
    ". however , this dark phase will gradually come to an end as the dark matter in the cusp annihilates , so the star may contract and finally reach a main sequence phase . a linear stability analysis and 1d simulations including hydrodynamics and radiation indicates the stability of such objects @xcite .",
    "in this case , one can expect a similar number of photons per stellar baryon as for conventional pop .",
    "iii stars , perhaps even higher by a factor of 2 @xcite . as it is crucial for these objects to form on the peak of the dark matter density , we expect them to form only in low - mass halos with a virial temperature below @xmath72 k , as the so - called atomic cooling halos are very turbulent @xcite and are more likely to form a stellar cluster instead of a single massive star @xcite .",
    "in addition , such massive halos are more likely to have accreted material from previous metal enrichment @xcite , which may cause fragmentation as well @xcite . in previously ionized regions , the thermodynamics of collapse are significantly altered and simulations generally find lower - mass stars @xcite , which might be an important limitation for dark stars as well .",
    "in this section , we show the results for the different stellar populations and in the context of different additional physics .",
    "we first concentrate on the effect of primordial magnetic fields and compare the results of different models for the stellar population .",
    "we run our reionization model for a range of different star formation efficiencies and primordial magnetic fields and obtain the corresponding optical depth . to constrain the parameter space , some assumptions need to be made .",
    "the first is obvious : the calculated optical depth must agree with the optical depth measured by wmap 5 at least within @xmath188 .",
    "in addition , we require that the star formation efficiency may not be unreasonably high . for pop .",
    "iii stars with @xmath189 forming in halos of @xmath190 ( dark matter ) , star formation efficiencies of the order @xmath191 are expected .",
    "it seems thus reasonable to reject star formation efficiencies higher by one order of magnitude , i. e. of the order @xmath192 .",
    "further requirements are that reionization must be complete by redshift 6 , and that there should be a stellar contribution to reionization , so that the universe becomes metal - enriched .",
    "now we discuss the constraints resulting from these criteria .",
    "+   + for all stellar models , we can exclude magnetic fields larger than @xmath193 ng , based on the optical depth alone ( see fig .",
    "[ taua ] to [ taud ] ) .",
    "a transition occurs at about @xmath194 ng : for lower magnetic fields , reionization is still mostly due to stellar radiation , whereas for higher magnetic fields , the igm is heated to such high temperatures that collisional ionization becomes very efficient and increases the optical depth . in this regime ,",
    "structure formation is strongly suppressed , as the magnetic jeans mass scales with @xmath195 and dominates over the thermal jeans mass .",
    "independently of the stellar model , such a regime is always found between @xmath194 and @xmath193 ng .",
    "therefore , structure formation is considerably impeded such that metals do not form and the universe is not fully ionized by redshift @xmath196 .",
    "we can thus exclude magnetic field strength above @xmath194 ng independent of the stellar model .",
    "+   + if we further require that the star formation efficiency must be lower than @xmath192 , the results become model - dependent . in model",
    "a , which is an extreme case where very high escape fractions are assumed even for very massive halos , no further constraint on the magnetic field is possible on the @xmath188 level .",
    "still , even in this extreme case , one can reject fields larger than @xmath197 ng on the @xmath198 level .",
    "the other extreme case , model d with low escape fractions and a low number of ionizing photons per stellar baryon , can be rejected completely , as it always requires unphysically high star formation efficiencies .",
    "+   + for more realistic cases , essentially model b and c , we find that a critical magnetic field strength exists above which a very high star formation efficiency is needed to get into the @xmath188 interval around the measured optical depth . for model",
    "b , the critical value is @xmath199 ng , for model c , it is at @xmath1 ng . as it seems likely that a transition to less massive pop .",
    "ii stars occurs during reionization , model c might indeed be the most realistic case and provide an upper limit of @xmath1 ng .      for the case of dark matter annihilation and decay",
    ", we will show only the results for the pop .",
    "iii star model b. regarding the competition between stellar reionization and secondary ionization from high - energetic annihilation / decay products , this corresponds to a rather conservative choice if one assumes that stellar reionization should do the main contribution .",
    "such a stellar population could be interpreted either as conventional pop .",
    "iii stars or as so - called dark stars in a main sequence phase .",
    "we find that dark matter annihilation starts to become important for @xmath200 and completely dominates the stellar contribution for higher values ( see fig .",
    "[ img : annihilation ] ) .",
    "values higher than @xmath201 are inconsistent with the wmap 5-year data .",
    "the results for dark matter decay are given in fig .",
    "[ img : decay ] .",
    "decay starts to become important for lifetimes below @xmath202 s. however , lifetimes smaller than @xmath203 s are incompatible with wmap 5 .",
    "as pointed out recently , constraints on dark matter annihilation can be significantly improved taking into account the dark matter clumping factor @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "however , this quantity is highly uncertain and may vary by six orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in the framework of light dark matter , we recently showed that is is constrained to be smaller than @xmath205 at redshift zero @xcite , yielding an enhancement of the annihilation rate by a factor of @xmath206 or more at redshift @xmath193 .",
    "other dark matter models @xcite even yield a clumping factor that drops down to @xmath207 at these redshifts , such that our calculation altogether provides a conservative and firm upper limit .    from fig .",
    "[ img : annihilation ] , we can further see that very massive dark stars in a main sequence phase , which should have higher star formation efficienes that are an order of magnitude higher than conventional pop .",
    "iii stars , are ruled out by wmap 5 , as the models require rather low star formation efficiencies to reproduce the thomson scattering optical depth .",
    "of course , this conclusion holds only if one assumes that reionization is completely due to dark stars , which seems rather unlikely ( see discussion in  [ dark star ] ) , and we will discuss some alternatives in  [ outlook ] .",
    "we have calculated the reionization optical depth for different stellar models in the presence of primordial magnetic fields as well as dark matter annihilation and decay .",
    "the results indicate which star formation efficiencies are required in the presence of some additional heating mechanism for a given stellar model . considering different stellar models and primordial magnetic fields , we find the following results :    1 .",
    "independent of the model for the stellar population , we can securely exclude primordial magnetic fields larger than @xmath194 ng .",
    "2 .   for the most realistic case with a mixed stellar population ( model c )",
    ", we even find an upper limit of @xmath1 ng , as higher magnetic fields would require star formation efficiencies larger than @xmath192 , which is unrealistic .",
    "similar results are found for model b , assuming reionization completely due to pop .",
    "iii stars .",
    "3 .   reionization only due to population ii stars ( model d ) is ruled out completely .      1 .",
    "dark matter annihilation provides noticeable contributions to the reionization optical depth only for thermally averaged mass - weighted cross sections @xmath208 .",
    "parameters @xmath209 can be ruled out by @xmath188 on the basis of wmap 5 year data .",
    "dark matter decay becomes important for the reionization optical depth for lifetimes below @xmath202 s. 4 .",
    "dark matter lifetimes below @xmath203 s are ruled out by @xmath188 .",
    "these results are in agreement with conservative constraints obtained from the gamma - ray background @xcite .",
    "we further showed that reionization can not be due to @xmath210 dark stars alone , as the corresponding optical depth would be significantly too high .",
    "one might wonder whether heating from dark matter annihilation might help to significantly delay stellar reionization , in order to reconcile this model with observations .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ img : annihilation ] , this is more than compensated by the effects of secondary ionization , once that dark matter annihilation starts to have a significant influence on the igm . in case collider experiments like the lhc or other dark matter detection experiments find evidence for a self - annihilating dark matter candidate , this can be seen as evidence for a rapid transition towards a different mode of star formation , or a problem in our understanding of dark stars . to reconcile dark stars with observations ,",
    "the following scenarios seem feasible :    1 .",
    "dark stars with @xmath211 may be extremely rare objects , and their actual mass scale is closer to the mass scale for typical pop .",
    "iii stars . in such a case , reionization could not distinguish between dark stars and conventional pop .",
    "iii stars .",
    "2 .   the transition to lower - mass stars occurs very rapidly , such that dark stars only contribute to the very early phase of reionization .",
    "reasons for that might be chemical , radiative as well as mechanical feedback ( see also the discussion in  [ dark star ] ) .",
    "in fact , even a double - reionization scenario might be conceivable , in which very massive dark stars ionize the universe at high redshifts . due to chemical and radiative feedback , formation of such stars",
    "might be suppressed and the universe might become neutral again , until the formation of less massive stars becomes efficient enough to reionize the universe .",
    "3 .   dark stars do not reach a main - sequence phase , but are disrupted earlier by some non - linear instability .",
    "such an instability would be constrained by the fact that it neither appears in a linear stability analysis nore in 1d simulations .",
    "violent explosions of dark stars might even be considered as a source for gamma - ray bursts .    while too definite conclusions on the existence of dark stars are not yet possible , it is at least indicated that the possibilities mentioned above should be explored in more detailed , and a better understanding of the properties of the dark stars",
    ". a better understanding of their evolution after the dark phase will certainly help to better understand their possible role during reionization .",
    "the constraints derived here are independent of other works that essentially rely on the physics of recombination to derive upper limits on additional physics ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , magnetic fields can evolve dynamically and their field strength may thus change between these epochs .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the biermann battery effect creates magnetic fields in the presence of an electron pressure gradient@xcite .",
    "we thus need to probe magnetic fields at different epochs .",
    "as we will show in a separate work @xcite , upcoming @xmath17 cm measurements will allow to probe the thermal history before and during reionization in great detail , and may allow to detect primordial magnetic fields of the order of @xmath212 ng .",
    "additional ways of probing the reionization history and the dark ages exist as well : scattering of cmb - photons in fine - structure lines of heavy elements may lead to a frequency - dependent cmb power spectrum and may allow to measure metal - abundances as a function of redshift @xcite . before reionization",
    ", molecules may form in the igm and introduce further frequency - dependent features in the cmb @xcite .",
    "such features are likely enhanced in the presence of either primordial magnetic fields or dark matter decay / annihilation , as the increased electron fraction catalyses the formation of molecules , and the additional heat input leads to a departure of the level populations from the radiation temperature .",
    "further improvements are expected from the upcoming measurement of planck , that will measure the reionization optical depth with unprecedent accuracy and thus allow to strengthen the constraints obtained here on the stellar populations and additional physics .",
    "in addition , a more accurate determination of the cosmological parameters will remove further uncertainties in the present models of reionization .",

    "<S> we calculate the reionization history for different models of the stellar population and explore the effects of primordial magnetic fields , dark matter decay and dark matter annihilation on reionization . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stellar populations based on a scalo - type initial mass function for population ii stars can be ruled out as sole sources for reionization , unless star formation efficiencies of more than @xmath0 or very high photon escape fractions from the parental halo are adopted . when considering primordial magnetic fields , we find that the additional heat injection from ambipolar diffusion and decaying mhd turbulence has significant impact on the thermal evolution and the ionization history of the post - recombination universe and on structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic jeans mass changes the typical mass scale of the star forming halos , and depending on the adopted stellar model we derive upper limits to the magnetic field strength between @xmath1 and @xmath2ng ( comoving ) . for dark matter annihilation </S>",
    "<S> , we find an upper limit to the thermally averaged mass - weighted cross section of @xmath3 . for dark matter decay , </S>",
    "<S> our calculations yield a lower limit to the lifetime of dark matter particles of @xmath4s . </S>",
    "<S> these limits are in agreement with constraints from recombination and provide an independent confirmation at a much later epoch . </S>"
