    "the recent spectacular development of the quantum information theory has revealed that information processing based on the laws of quantum mechanics enables implementation of tasks that are impossible or very hard to accomplish classically .",
    "the prime examples are the unconditionally secure cryptography @xcite and the exponential speedup of certain computational tasks , such as the factoring of integers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the linearity of quantum mechanics also imposes certain constraints on the processing of quantum information that have no classical counterpart .",
    "perhaps the most famous example is the no - cloning theorem which states that an unknown quantum state can not be copied @xcite .",
    "however , this restriction provides , in fact , a valuable resource explored in the quantum key distribution protocols , because it forbids an eavesdropper eve to gain information on the distributed secret key without introducing errors .",

    "the probabilistic cloners have been discussed in the literature in the context of cloning of a discrete finite set of quantum states and it was shown that an exact probabilistic cloning is possible if and only if the set consists of linearly independent states @xcite .",
    "however , one may hope that the probabilistic machines may yield better results also for the sets of linearly dependent quantum states and even for infinite ( continuous ) sets . here , we investigate the probabilistic cloning of linearly dependent states and we establish a general theory of the optimal probabilistic cloning machines .",
    "we provide a simple formula for the optimal average fidelity of the probabilistic machine and we also show how to construct the optimal cloning transformations .",
    "in fact , our formalism is very general and it concerns optimal probabilistic implementations of arbitrary transformations whose outputs should ideally be pure states .",
    "besides cloning , this includes also universal not gate for qubits @xcite , and , perhaps even more importantly , probabilistic purification of mixed quantum states @xcite . in what follows we",

    "besides of maximal fidelity , we are interested also in the maximal probability @xmath72 of optimal purification .",
    "we have therefore carried out full calculations of the operators @xmath216 and @xmath215 for @xmath271 and determined the degeneracy of the maximal eigenvalue of matrix @xmath61 .",
    "these calculations reveal that the optimal eigenvectors @xmath272 of @xmath61 all satisfy the relation @xmath273\\in b(\\mathcal{h}_{+,n})$ ] so we can in fact consider only the maps of the form ( [ ekmap ] ) without any loss of generality .",
    "if only a single qubit is sent to bob , then the only option is @xmath274 and the best filter obtained by setting @xmath275 which achieves a fidelity @xmath276 .",
    "the purification succeeds with probability @xmath277 .    for @xmath278",
    "the maximum fidelity @xmath279 is given by @xmath280 one option how to achieve @xmath279 is to choose @xmath274 and @xmath281 .",
    "the second alternative is @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath70 of the admissible optimal operations @xmath10 is thus two - dimensional and spanned by basis states latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    \\nonumber \\\\    to find @xmath10 that maximizes @xmath72 we must solve ( [ sdp ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ etwirling ] ) and ( [ edecompositionad ] ) that the optimal @xmath10 is diagonal in basis @xmath285 , @xmath286 .",
    "consequently , the semidefinite program ( [ sdp ] ) reduces to a linear program and we have to maximize @xmath287 under the constraints @xmath288 for @xmath289 the optimal coefficients read @xmath290 , @xmath291 while for @xmath292 we have @xmath293 and @xmath294 . for all @xmath295",
    "the optimal probability is given by a simple formula @xmath296    finally , when alice sends three qubits to bob ( @xmath297 ) , then the optimal fidelity of bob s purified qubit is given by @xmath298,\\ ] ] and the only way to reach @xmath299 is to choose @xmath282 and @xmath300 .",
    "the purification succeeds with probability @xmath301    the dependence of the optimal fidelities on @xmath302 is plotted in fig .",
    "2(a ) which clearly illustrates that the purification results in a significant improvement of the fidelity .",
    "the relative improvement is maximal when @xmath303 but this is reached at the expense of very low probability of success , see fig .",
    "note also that @xmath304 .",
    "if bob possesses three noisy qubits and tries to extract one qubit , then his optimal probabilistic strategy will have a finite probability of failure for arbitrarily low damping .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the optimal _ probabilistic _ realizations of several important quantum - information - processing tasks such as the optimal cloning of quantum states and purification of mixed quantum states .",
    "we have derived a simple formula for the maximum achievable average fidelity and we have provided an explicit prescription how to construct a trace - decreasing cp map that reaches the fidelity @xmath63 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the fidelity of probabilistic cloning can be strictly higher than the maximal fidelity of deterministic cloning even if the set of the cloned states is linearly dependent and continuous .",
    "however , it should be stressed that this improvement in fidelity is achieved at the expense of a certain fraction of unsuccessful events when the probabilistic transformation fails and does not produce any output state .",
    "the optimal probabilistic maps may find a variety of applications .",
    "for instance , the phase covariant cloning is an efficient attack on several quantum key distribution protocols . in particular , the @xmath305 phase - covariant cloning is explored for eavesdropping purposes in ref .",
    "thus , the probabilistic phase - covariant cloning discussed in the present paper may be possibly used as a new eavesdropping attack .",
    "moreover , the general theory of optimal probabilistic transformations developed in the present paper has much broader range of applications than just cloning .",
    "in particular , it provides a method to engineer optimal protocols for purification of mixed quantum states .",
    "we have seen on the example of the amplitude damping channel that the optimal probabilistic purification may result in a dramatic improvement of the fidelity of the final bob s state with respect to the original state that was sent to him by alice via a noisy channel . however , the large improvement of the fidelity is typically accompanied by a very low probability of success .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to optimize the probabilistic transformation also with respect to the average success probability which leads to a semidefinite program that can be very efficiently solved numerically . for the particular cases of purification of mixed states investigated in the present paper , we have been able to solve the resulting sdp analytically , by exploiting the symmetries inherent to the problem .",
    "the protocol considered in the present paper can be even further generalized as follows .",
    "one can imagine a scenario where the average fidelity of the operation @xmath37 is maximized for a fixed chosen average probability of success @xmath72 , or vice versa , these two alternatives are clearly equivalent .",
    "generally , there will always be a trade - off between @xmath72 and @xmath37 and the optimal fidelity will be some function of @xmath72 .",
    "one can then choose the working point on the @xmath306 curve that is most fitting for the particular task at hand .",
    "the determination of maximal @xmath37 obtainable for some fixed @xmath72 can be formulated as a semidefinite program similar to that given by eq .",
    "( [ sdp ] ) .",
    "the deterministic machines and the probabilistic machines that achieve the maximum possible fidelity represent two extreme regimes of such a more general scenario .",
