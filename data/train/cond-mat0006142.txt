    "recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite papers provide a strong evidence for the existence of the phase separated state in the perovskite manganites with the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "both experiment and theory demonstrate that under certain conditions the material in the phase separated state consists of small ferromagnetic metallic droplets , or magnetic polarons , embedded into the insulating antiferromagnetic ( afm ) matrix .",
    "the droplet in the ground state contains one charge carrier ( electron or hole ) confined in a potential well of ferromagnetically ordered local spins . in refs .",
    "the model allowing the estimation of the droplet radius and droplet concentration was proposed . according to this model",
    ", the radius of the droplet @xmath1 is defined from the minimization of the energy : @xmath2 , where the first term is related to the kinetic energy of electron delocalization in the bubble with the radius @xmath3 , and the second term corresponds to the loss in the energy of the heisenberg afm exchange due to ferromagnetic ordering of local spins @xmath4 inside the bubble .",
    "the minimization of the energy with respect to droplet radius yields the following estimate for @xmath1 in @xmath5 case : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the afm heisenberg exchange , @xmath8 is the bandwidth , and @xmath9 is the intersite distance . the number of charge carriers is proportional to the electron ( hole ) doping @xmath10 .",
    "volume concentration of metallic droplets increases with @xmath10 and with the decrease of the temperature since the droplet radius @xmath1 decreases with temperature growth . as a result , at some critical concentration of holes @xmath11",
    "the droplets start to overlap and the percolation metal - insulator transition occurs in the system @xcite . in ref .",
    "it was observed that heating and cooling of the perovskite manganites in the phase separated state is accompanied by strong hysteresis in the magnetization and the resistance .",
    "in addition , the giant @xmath0 noise was measured in these experiments .",
    "the noise power is very high even far from the percolation threshold and drastically increases in its vicinity .",
    "the noise spectrum is close to @xmath0 form in the @xmath12  @xmath13 hz frequency range .    in this paper , we calculate conductivity , magnetoresistance , and noise spectral power of the system in the phase separated state .",
    "the calculations are based on the results of refs . @xcite and on a simple model for the tunneling conductivity of the material accounting for electron jumps from one polaron to another . the concentration range not too close to the percolation transition",
    "is considered .",
    "we use the terms _ ( magnetic ) polarons _ and _ droplets _ interchangeably throughout the paper .",
    "let us consider an insulating antiferromagnetic sample of volume @xmath14 in electric field @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of magnetic polarons in the volume is @xmath16 , and thus their spatial density is @xmath17 .",
    "as it was mentioned before , the number of polarons is assumed to be equal to the number of charge carriers introduced by doping . neglecting the conductivity of the insulating phase ,",
    "we assume that charge carriers are only located within the droplets .",
    "the charge transfer can thus occur either due to the motion of the droplets or due to the electron tunneling .",
    "the former mechanism is less effective : indeed , the motion of a droplet is accompanied by a considerable rearrangement of the local magnetic structure , which results in the big effective mass of magnetic polarons . in addition , the droplets are expected to be easily pinned by crystal lattice defects .",
    "thus , it is realistic to assume that the charge transport is essentially due to electron transitions between the droplets .",
    "a magnetic polaron in the ground state contains one electron . as a result of a tunneling process",
    ", droplets with more than one electron are created , and some droplets become empty ( the lifetime of such excitations is discussed in the end of this section ) .",
    "if the energy of an empty droplet @xmath18 is taken to be zero , the energy of a droplet with one electron can be estimated as @xmath19 .",
    "this is essentially the kinetic energy of an electron localized in the sphere of the radius @xmath1 . in the same way , the energy of two - electron magnetic polaron @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the interaction energy of the two electrons . in all these estimates , we have disregarded the surface energy , which is expected to be small @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath22 , and the creation of two - electron droplets is associated with the energy barrier of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that the interaction energy @xmath21 of two electrons in one droplet is determined mainly by the coulomb repulsion of these electrons , hence @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the static dielectric constant , which in real manganites can be rather large ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume below that the mean distance between the droplets is @xmath27 ( the droplets do not overlap ) .",
    "then , @xmath28 is larger than the average coulomb energy @xmath29 .",
    "since the characteristic value of the droplet radius @xmath1 is of the order of 10 @xcite , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the case under study . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the temperature is low , @xmath32 , and we do not consider a possibility of the formation of the droplets with three or more electrons . even in the case",
    "when these excitations are stable , it can be shown that far from the percolation threshold the strong coulomb interaction suppresses their contribution to the conductivity ( giving rise only to the next order terms with respect to @xmath33 ) .",
    "let us denote the numbers of single - electron , two - electron , and empty droplets as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively . according to our model",
    ", @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath16 is constant . before turning to conductivity",
    ", we evaluate the thermal averages of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to this end",
    ", we note that the number @xmath39 of possible states with @xmath40 two - electron droplets and @xmath40 empty droplets equals @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the binomial coefficients",
    ". since the created pairs of droplets are independent , we write the partition function in the form @xmath43 though the sum can be evaluated exactly and expressed in terms of the legendre polynomials for arbitrary @xmath16 , it is more convenient to use the stirling formula for the factorials and the condition that the sample is macroscopic , @xmath44 . approximating the sum by an integral , @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] calculating it in the saddle - point approximation , and subsequently evaluating in the same way the statistical average of @xmath35 , @xmath46 we easily obtain @xmath47.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now we calculate the conductivity . within the framework of the proposed model the electron tunneling occurs via one of the four following processes illustrated in fig .  1 ,    \\(i ) in the initial state we have two droplets in the ground state , and after tunneling in the final state we have an empty droplet and a droplet with two electrons ;    \\(ii ) an empty droplet and a two - electron droplet in the initial state transform into two droplets in the ground state ( two droplets with one electron ) ;",
    "\\(iii ) a two - electron droplet and a single - electron droplet exchange their positions by transferring an electron from one droplet to the other ;    \\(iv ) an empty droplet and a single - electron droplet exchange their positions by transferring an electron from one droplet to the other .    in the linear regime , all these processes contribute to the current density @xmath48 independently , @xmath49 .",
    "the contributions of the first two processes read @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the densities of the single- and two - electron droplets , and @xmath52 stands for statistical and time averages .",
    "the appearance of the factors @xmath53 reflects the fact that the electron tunnels _ from _ a single - electron droplet ( process ( i ) ) or two - electron ( ii ) droplet .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ cur1 ] ) is performed over all magnetic polarons the electron can tunnel _ to _  one - electron droplets for the process ( i ) and empty droplets for the process ( ii ) .",
    "finally , the components of average electron velocity @xmath54 along the direction of the electric field are obviously found as @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the electron tunneling length ( the distance between the droplets ) and the angle between the electric field and the direction of motion , respectively , and @xmath58 are characteristic times associated with the tunneling processes .",
    "the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be found from the following considerations . near the equilibrium ,",
    "the number of two - electron droplets , excited per unit time , equals to the number of the decaying two - electron droplets .",
    "we thus have the detail balance relation , @xmath61 where we have taken into account that the probability of the formation of a two - electron droplet is proportional to the total number @xmath34 of the single - electron states multiplied by the number of available hopping destinations , which also equals @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the probability of decay of a two - electron droplet is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "( [ equil ] ) implies @xmath63 .",
    "we write then the conventional expression for the tunneling times @xcite in the following form , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the characteristic tunneling length and magnon frequency , and we have taken into account the contribution of the external electric field to the tunneling probability .    to perform the averaging , we assume that the centers of the magnetic polarons are randomly positioned in space and the average distance @xmath67 between them is much larger than the droplet radius @xmath1 .",
    "both assumptions seem to be perfectly justified far below the percolation threshold . then the averaged sum in eq .",
    "( [ cur1 ] ) is essentially the space average of @xmath68 , multiplied by the number of droplets available for hopping ( @xmath34 for the process ( i ) and @xmath35 for the process ( ii ) ) . expanding in @xmath69",
    ", we obtain @xmath70    in eq .",
    "( [ veloc2 ] ) , electric field is outside the averaging . rigorously speaking",
    ", this means that the characteristic hopping length @xmath65 is larger than the interdroplet distance @xmath67 and our approach is valid only when the droplet concentration is not too small .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ veloc2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cur1 ] ) and performing the integration , we find @xmath71    in the processes ( iii ) and ( iv ) the free energy of the system is not changed after the tunneling , and we write the characteristic times as @xmath72 the contribution of these two processes to the current is calculated similarly to that of ( i ) and ( ii ) . for the process ( iii )",
    "the number of magnetic polarons from which the electron may tunnel , is @xmath35 , whereas the number of accepting droplets is @xmath34 . in the same way , for the process ( iv ) these numbers are @xmath34 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the factors @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ cur11 ] ) are replaced by @xmath75 , @xmath76    from eqs .",
    "( [ cur11 ] ) and ( [ cur31 ] ) we now obtain the dc conductivity @xmath77 , @xmath78.\\ ] ]    in this section we are only interested in the average conductivity ; fluctuations lead to the appearance of noise and are considered in section [ noissect ] . using eq .",
    "( [ avern2 ] ) , we find that all the four processes illustrated in fig .",
    "1 give identical contributions to the conductivity ; for @xmath79 the average conductivity ( for which we retain the notation @xmath80 ) reads @xmath81    we see that the conductivity increases with temperature as @xmath82 , which is typical for tunneling systems ( see _ e.g. _ ref . ) .    at this point ,",
    "let us discuss the applicability range of our model .",
    "the essence of our picture is the existence of different types of droplets .",
    "of course , only single - electron droplets are stable .",
    "obviously , an empty droplet decays during the time of the order of @xmath83 . on the other hand , following the above discussion , the empty droplet should acquire an electron from neighboring one - electron or two - electron droplets during the characteristic time @xmath84 , which can be easily calculated based on the following considerations .",
    "the probability @xmath85 per unit time for an empty droplet to acquire one electron can be written as @xmath86 where the terms with @xmath87 and @xmath88 correspond to the electron transfer from single- and two- electron droplets , respectively . performing integration in eq .",
    "( [ emptydr ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ avern2 ] ) , we find @xmath89    just the same estimate can be obtained for the characteristic time of electrons leaving two - electron droplets . for our picture with empty and two - electron droplets to be valid , the following condition must be met , @xmath90 . thus , our approach is valid at sufficiently low temperatures , @xmath91 , and for not too small droplet density @xmath92 .",
    "the applicability of our approach also implies that @xmath93 .",
    "it is of interest to consider also the case of @xmath94 and/or low droplet concentrations . in this situation , in usual hopping systems ,",
    "the conductivity strongly depends on the geometry of current paths @xcite .",
    "this causes exponential dependence of conductivity on the carrier concentration . however , our system turns out to be more complicated that those commonly invoked for hopping conductivity .",
    "it involves different types of hopping centers giving rise to unusual geometry of current paths .",
    "therefore , the conventional approaches used for hopping can not be applied straightforwardly to the analysis of our model at low droplet concentration or at @xmath94 . despite these complications",
    ", we believe that the expression for the conductivity in the case @xmath95 includes the percolation - related factor @xmath96 , with @xmath97 of the order one @xcite , though currently we have no rigorous proof of this statement .",
    "the results below for magnetoresistance and noise are insensitive to this factor , and therefore we expect them to be valid in a general case .",
    "as we already discussed , below the percolation threshold when the volume fraction of droplets @xmath98 , a typical value of @xmath99 is mainly determined by coulomb interactions between two electrons inside the droplet @xmath100 and has a typical value of @xmath101 .",
    "now we can use this estimate to analyze the magnetoresistance in non - metallic phase - separated manganites . to do that",
    ", we use the expression for the radius of the magnetic polaron , obtained in the introduction @xmath102 .",
    "recall once more that here @xmath103100 k is an afm heisenberg exchange between the local spins @xmath104 .",
    "it is natural to conclude that in the magnetic field @xmath105 the heisenberg exchange integral @xmath7 decreases according to the formula @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the bohr magneton and the gyromagnetic ratio , respectively .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath28 is decreasing linearly in the experimentally accessible range of magnetic fields , and for the excitation energy we obtain @xmath109 , \\ \\ \\ b = \\frac{1}{5 } \\frac{g \\mu_b}{j(0)s}.\\ ] ] it follows now from eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) that the magnetoresistance is negative and for temperatures @xmath110 reads @xmath111 - 1   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left ( \\frac{bha}{2k_{b}t } \\right ) - 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for low magnetic fields and not very small temperatures the absolute value of the magnetoresistance is small , @xmath112 . in higher fields",
    "( but still @xmath113 ) the absolute value of magnetoresistance eventually exceeds one and behaves in the exponential fashion , @xmath114 . note that for temperatures @xmath115 and for typical gyromagnetic ratios @xmath116 the magnetoresistance in our region of doping becomes larger than one by absolute value only in relatively high magnetic fields @xmath117 t .",
    "recently , podzorov _ et al _ @xcite reported the observation of giant @xmath0 noise in perovskite manganites in the phase separated regime . generally , systems with distributed hopping lengths are standard objects which exhibit @xmath0 noise ( for review , see refs . ) .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study low - frequency noise within the framework of the model used to calculate the conductivity in section [ condsect ] , and show that it has , indeed , @xmath0 form .",
    "starting from the ohm s law @xmath118 ( where @xmath119 and @xmath4 are the sample length and the cross - section , respectively ) and assuming that the measuring circuit is stabilized ( @xmath120 ) , we can present the voltage noise at the frequency @xmath121 , @xmath122 , in the following way , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the time - averaged voltage , and @xmath125 is the noise spectrum of the fluctuations of the conductivity .",
    "if we disregard possible fluctuations of temperature in the system , the only source of the fluctuations in our model is those of the occupation numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 . using the conservation law @xmath126",
    ", we find from eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) @xmath127.\\ ] ] we thus need to find the fluctuation spectrum @xmath128 .",
    "following the general prescription @xcite , we recollect that the two - electron droplets decay via the process ( ii ) , and the relaxation equation has the form @xmath129 where we have neglected the effect of the electric field .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum then reads @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the thermal average of the variation of @xmath88 , and the summation is performed over the pairs `` empty droplet  two - electron droplet '' , with @xmath132 being the distance between the sites in a pair .",
    "the average in eq .",
    "( [ nfl1 ] ) is essentially a spatial integral , with the main contribution coming from short distances , @xmath133 note that eq.([nfl2 ] ) is valid for an arbitrary relation between @xmath65 and @xmath1 , not necessarily for @xmath134 .",
    "we are interested below in the frequency range @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the smallest of the sample sizes . in this case , with the logarithmic accuracy we obtain for @xmath79 , @xmath137 thus , in the wide range of sufficiently low frequencies ( [ freqr ] ) the noise power spectrum for our system has almost @xmath0 form .    the variation @xmath138 is easily found in the same way as eq .",
    "( [ avern2 ] ) , @xmath139 combining this with eq .",
    "( [ nfl3 ] ) , we write the final expression for the spectral density of noise for @xmath79 in the form @xmath140",
    "for the further discussion , it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ voltfl1 ] ) in the form @xmath141    it is remarkable that the noise spectrum in our model has @xmath0 form up to very low frequencies .",
    "this is due to fluctuations in occupation numbers of droplets , associated with creation and annihilation of extra electron  hole pairs .",
    "this mechanism of @xmath0 noise is specific for our model and is not present in standard hopping conduction .",
    "let us estimate the numerical value of the parameter @xmath142 , which is the standard measure of the strength of @xmath0 noise .",
    "this parameter is proportional to the third power of @xmath65 .",
    "simple estimates ( analogous to that presented in the introduction for @xmath1 ) reveal that , in general , @xmath65 of the order or higher than @xmath1 .",
    "assuming again that the excitation energy is of the order of the coulomb energy @xmath143 , taking @xmath66 to be of the order of the fermi energy inside droplets ( which means @xmath144 for @xmath145 ) , and estimating the tunneling length @xmath65 as being @xmath14620  , we arrive to a conclusion that the parameter @xmath147 is of the order @xmath148@xmath149@xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath1521 hz  1 mhz .",
    "this value of @xmath142 is by several orders of magnitude higher than in usual semiconducting materials ( see ref . ) .",
    "such a large magnitude of the noise can be attributed to the relatively low height of the potential barrier @xmath28 and to the relatively large tunneling length @xmath65 .",
    "formally , it is also related to the large value of the logarithm squared in eq .",
    "( [ voltfl2 ] ) .    according to eqs .",
    "( [ voltfl1 ] ) and ( [ voltfl2 ] ) , the noise power and the noise parameter @xmath142 are independent of the volume fraction occupied by the droplets .",
    "this result is valid in the intermediate range of @xmath92 , when the droplet density is not too high and not too low .",
    "first , we assumed that the droplets are isolated point objects and the tunneling between the two droplets is not affected by a third polaron .",
    "this is only valid provided the droplet density is far from the percolation threshold , @xmath153 . on the other hand , the droplet density must not be too low since the conditions @xmath154 are assumed to be met .",
    "moreover , we neglected the possibilities of the disappearance of a droplet without an electron , the formation of a new droplet due to the electron tunneling , and the decay of two - electron droplets .",
    "thus , the characteristic times of these processes should be longer than the characteristic tunneling time , and the average tunneling distance can not be too high ( see eq .",
    "( [ lifetime ] ) and the discussion below it ) .",
    "the above speculations imply that the following set of inequalities should be met , @xmath155 , for formula ( [ cond2 ] ) for the conductivity to be valid .",
    "in general , the tunneling length should not be much larger than the droplet radius since just the same physical parameters determine these two characteristic distances .",
    "so , these inequalities could not be valid for real physical systems and it is of interest to consider the situation where @xmath156 , which is beyond the scope of our model .",
    "however , some definite conclusions concerning the magnetoresistance and the noise power can be made at present .",
    "first , the factor @xmath157 in the temperature dependence of the conductivity is related to the number of carriers and appears due to strong coulomb repulsion of electrons in the droplet .",
    "it seems rather obvious that such a factor appears in the formula for the conductivity below the percolation threshold for an arbitrary relation between @xmath1 and @xmath65 . on the other hand , in contrast to common hopping systems , strong @xmath0 noise in our model results from fluctuations of state occupation numbers",
    "actually , our result for parameter @xmath142 ( [ voltfl2 ] ) only relies on the fact that @xmath158 , and thus the noise power is expected to have @xmath0 form below the percolation threshold for any relation between @xmath1 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , we can also conclude that in our model strong @xmath0 noise will be found under the ( experimentally relevant ) conditions @xmath159 .",
    "another important point is that we disregard direct coulomb interaction between the droplets in comparison with the energy @xmath28 .",
    "this is justified if the gas of the droplets is diluted , @xmath160 . in this respect ,",
    "we recollect that in standard hopping conduction systems ( doped semiconductors ) the main mechanism of low - frequency noise is an exchange of electrons between the infinite cluster and nearby finite clusters . in the absence of interactions it leads to the noise power proportional to @xmath161 , with the exponent @xmath142 being considerably below one @xcite . to explain @xmath0 noise in these systems , models involving coulomb interactions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these sources of low - frequency noise are thus beyond our discussion .",
    "we also did not consider sources of noise different from resistance fluctuations .",
    "at least two other types of noise are inevitably present in the system , nyquist - johnson ( thermal ) noise , which is a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and shot noise due to the discrete nature of electron charge ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "both these noises are frequency independent ( white ) at low frequencies .",
    "the magnitudes of nyquist - johnson , shot , and @xmath0 noises are governed by absolutely different parameters , and we do not attempt to compare them here , noting only that at low frequencies @xmath0 noise must dominate .    in our model , we assumed that the number of droplets @xmath16 is fixed and strictly equal to the number of extra electrons . in actual systems ,",
    "@xmath16 can also fluctuate , and this can be an additional source of noise , and of @xmath0 noise , in particular .",
    "however , this contribution depends critically on the heights of corresponding energy barriers and can vary for different systems .    as we have already mentioned , the main motivation of our work was the experimental study @xcite , which observed high @xmath0 noise power at high temperatures far from the metal - insulator transition .",
    "in the same experiment , noise dropped to much lower levels at low temperatures in the metallic phase .",
    "this behavior of the noise power is consistent with the present model since in the metallic phase the electron tunneling contribution to the total conductivity is negligible . in the vicinity of the percolation transition",
    "the noise power increases drastically @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to describe the system of magnetic polarons close to the percolation threshold .",
    "however , we argue that the amplitude of @xmath0 noise is already large in the phase - separated regime even far from the percolation threshold .",
    "we emphasize that even in our oversimplified model we get a reasonable behavior of resistivity and magnetoresistance for underdoped manganites .",
    "moreover , we have shown that in the framework of our model @xmath0 noise appears in the natural way .",
    "the phase - separation ensures a large magnitude of the noise power as compared with homogeneous materials .",
    "of course , a more sophisticated theory should include both the ferromagnetic structure of the droplet and the antiferromagnetic structure of the insulating matrix .",
    "this can lead us to the physics resembling that observed in the process of spin - assisted tunneling , which attracts a considerable interest nowadays ( see _ e.g. _ ref . ) .",
