    "the investigations concerning the interaction of black holes with various fields around give us the possibility to get some information about the physics of black holes .",
    "one of these information can be obtained from quasinormal modes ( qnms ) which are characteristic of the background black hole spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the concept of qnms is first formulated by vishveshwara in calculations of the scattering of gravitational waves by a black hole @xcite , which present complex frequencies whose real part represents the actual frequency of the oscillation and the imaginary part represents the damping .",
    "the survey of field perturbation in black hole spacetimes motivated the extensive numerical and analytical study of qnms @xcite .",
    "in addition , the properties of qnms have been studied in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite . some reviews where a lot of references to the recent research of qnms can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    among several types of field perturbation , gravitational perturbation",
    "is considered to be the most important one .",
    "the reason is that gravitational qnms are important in directly identifying black holes and their gravitational radiation .",
    "many theoretical physicists believe that the gravitational qnms is a unique fingerprint in searching the existence of a black hole .",
    "recently , astrophysical interests in qnms originated from their relevance in gravitational wave analysis .",
    "on september 14th , 2015 , two advanced detectors of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) made the first direct measurement of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the advanced ligo detectors observed a transient gravitational - wave signal determined to be the coalescence of two black holes , launching the era of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the issue of black hole gravitational stability under perturbations was first addressed by regge and wheeler @xcite in the fifties of last century .",
    "they classified gravitational perturbations into two types : odd parity and even parity by means of getting rid of the angular dependence of the perturbation variables through a tensorial generalization of the spherical harmonics , thus the calculation of gravitational perturbation was greatly simplified .",
    "the regge - wheeler formalism was later extended to the case of static black holes in four dimensions @xcite and higher dimensions @xcite , and even to the case of rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "one can find a complete description of black hole perturbation theory in the book by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of understanding how to avoid singularities in black hole spacetimes is important in general relativity . in 1968 ,",
    "a `` regular '' black hole without a singularity was constructed by bardeen @xcite .",
    "this regular black hole spacetime lacked a consistent physical interpretation until ayn - beato and his coworkers @xcite obtained this black hole solution by describing it as the gravitational field of nonlinear magnetic monopole with a mass @xmath1 and a charge @xmath2 in 2000 .",
    "the bardeen solution has motivated deeper works about singularity avoidance may be realized generally . several other researchers paid attention to theories of gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics , and proposed other solutions in different contexts . some solutions that are relevant to this work are analyzed in refs . @xcite and refs .",

    "recently , there are several interesting works concerning the regular black hole .",
    "eiroa and sendra have investigated gravitational lensing of the regular black hole spacetime @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , exact solutions of spherically symmetric spacetimes are proposed in @xmath3 modified theories of gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "the dynamical stability of black hole solutions in self - gravitating nonlinear electrodynamics with respect to linear gravitational fluctuation has been studied in @xcite .",
    "fernando and correa have studied qnms spectrum of the scalar field of the regular black hole for various values of the perturbation parameters @xcite .",
    "they have also used the unstable null geodesics of the black hole to compute the scalar qnms in the eikonal limit .",
    "further research about the qnms of neutral and charged scalar field perturbations on the regular black hole spacetime in a variety of models was carried out by flachi and lemos @xcite .",
    "massless and massive dirac qnms were studied in the regular black hole spacetime by using the wkb approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the behavior of the gravitational perturbation in the regular black hole spacetimes mentioned above . the wavelike perturbation equation , with an effective potential , can be solved by several methods , such as integration of the wavelike equations , the monodromy method , fit and interpolation approaches , the continued fraction method , the mashhoon method , the wkb approximation method , the asymptotic iteration method and so on @xcite .",
    "we calculate the gravitational qnms by using the 3th order wkb method as well as the asymptotic iteration method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we gives brief description of some well - known regular black hole spacetimes .",
    "the perturbative equation of the gravitational perturbation in given backgrounds is reduced to the schrdinger - like wave equation in section 3 .",
    "the next section is devoted to the numerical calculations of the gravitational qnms in given spacetimes by using the 3th order wkb approximation and the asymptotic iteration method .",
