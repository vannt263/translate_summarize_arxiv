    "one - dimensional disordered spin chain is an excellent example of strongly correlated quantum system that is well suited to study basic properties of such systems . in particular ,",
    "studies of disordered spin chains become one of the major playgrounds in the field of many body localization ( mbl )  @xcite . from the experimental viewpoint , quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnets  @xcite",
    "attract considerable attention due to very high thermal conductance , that is believed to be related with integrability of the clean heisenberg spin-@xmath7 chain  @xcite .",
    "it is known since seminal paper@xcite that in 1d competition between interaction and disorder may lead to delocalization and formation of a ground state that is nearly - free from the effects of disorder , see also @xcite .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite confirm that qualitative conclusion . in order to provide delocalization",
    ", interaction should be sufficiently strong and attractive , so this problem bears some resemblance with a model of superconductor - insulator transition in higher - dimensional systems  @xcite . looking from that perspective , it seems useful to develop a quantitative theory of the delocalized phase of one - dimensional quantum system with a bare disorder that is `` screened '' by interactions . in particular , it is important to study heat transport in such a system , that is expected to be dominated by the remains of the disorder potential .    here",
    "we will study the properties of anisotropic xxz spin chain in a random transverse magnetic field , which is described by the hamiltonian ( we assume @xmath8 ) :    @xmath9    by means of the jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h1 ] ) can be reduced to the hamiltonian of interacting spinless fermions ( here @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 the anisotropy parameter @xmath12 can be both positive and negative , which corresponds to the effective attraction or repulsion between jw fermions , respectively .",
    "we will consider random fields to be relatively small so that @xmath2 , and with zero average @xmath13 . thus our system is , on average , symmetric with respect to @xmath14 reflection , which translates into the particle - hole symmetry in terms of jw fermions .",
    "it ensures that in the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath15 only odd powers of @xmath16 survive .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study low - temperature transport properties , spin and heat conductivity , in the range of parameters @xmath17 where @xmath18 spin - spin correlations decay as a power law with a distance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we study the phase diagram by means of renormalization group approach formulated in @xcite .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to formulation and application of the keldysh approach to the transport properties of disordered luttinger liquid model that is an appropriate low - energy approximation for the lattice fermion model ( [ eq : h2 ] ) ; in sec.iii a , spin and heat conductivities ( @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) are studied within the region @xmath19 where disorder is irrelevant in the rg sense ; next , in sec.iii b we discuss specific behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath4 near the critical point @xmath20 ; the role of quantum interference corrections and decoherence is discussed in sec .",
    "iii c , and the role of spectrum nonlinearity is considered in sec.iii d. finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "in the clean limit @xmath21 and in the region @xmath22 excitation spectrum of the interacting one - dimensional fermion system is gapless ; then low - energy and long - distance properties of the system are known to be described by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model @xcite .",
    "it allows to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of fermion density excitations  plasmons .",
    "ll model is formulated in terms of canonically conjugated plasmon fields @xmath23 = i \\delta(x - y)$ ] ; in the linear approximation for the quasiparticle spectrum , the hamiltonian of the ll model reads @xmath24 here @xmath25 is plasmon velocity and @xmath26 is dimensionless luttinger parameter ; these parameters are determined , via the bethe ansatz solution for xxz model , by the values of @xmath27 and @xmath12 , see  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lattice constant .    in our model ( [ eq : h2 ] )",
    "disorder couples to the fermion density @xmath30 ; in the ll continuum limit it reads as @xmath31 .",
    "first and second terms in the above expression correspond to the slow ( @xmath32 ) and fast oscillating ( @xmath33 ) parts .",
    "thus there are two types of scattering of one - dimensional fermions by disorder : forward and backward .",
    "forward scattering is irrelevant within the linear approximation for the spectrum , since the corresponding term in the ll hamiltonian can be eliminated completely by the redefinition of phase @xmath34 .",
    "backward fermion scattering with momentum transfer @xmath33 is the only effect one should take into account then .",
    "thus we need only @xmath33 part of original random potential , this part is described by the random gaussian complex field @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "disorder contribution to the hamiltonian reads as follows : @xmath38    renormalization group approach to disordered luttinger liquid was formulated in @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless disorder parameter @xmath39 in terms of this parameter and logarithmic scaling parameter @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 being running ultraviolet cutoff ) , rg equations reads as follows : @xmath42    these equations can be solved analytically exploiting its first integral @xmath43 .",
    "this solution yields phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "delocalized region shrinks and eventually disappears already at @xmath46 . everywhere in the delocalized phase effective disorder @xmath47 decreases with @xmath48 .",
    "actually the derivation of the rg equations ( [ eq : rgflow ] ) as it was performed in  @xcite is valid quantitatively in the vicinity of the point @xmath49 only , where disorder - induced corrections to the parameter @xmath26 are logarithmic ; for large @xmath26 these equations can be used for qualitative analysis only . note that the drop of the critical disorder @xmath45 near the point @xmath50 is trivially related to the decrease of the effective luttinger velocity @xmath25 , see eqs",
    "..    phase diagram obtained by the analysis of rg equations can be compared with the numeric phase diagram from ref.@xcite ( its boundary is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] ) . according to these numerical data",
    ", the delocalized region covers much smaller part of the phase diagram than the rg calculations predict .",
    "we expect that the major source of this discrepancy is due to inapplicability of the rg equations ( [ eq : rgflow ] ) at large @xmath26 values .",
    "another reason could be related with the effects of spectrum nonlinearity that becomes important close to @xmath51 . on the other hand , near the point @xmath52 numerical data  @xcite",
    "suggest delocalization at the values of @xmath45 which are above our critical line ; we believe that this discrepancy comes from limited accuracy of the numerical data , due to finite size effects which becomes most prominent at very weak disorder .    ",

    "@xcite where two - loop rg calculation was performed . at smaller @xmath55 renormalized disorder parameter @xmath47 grows with @xmath48 , and one expects exponential decay of @xmath53 at @xmath56 , where correlation length @xmath57 , see  @xcite .",
    "note that for the case of xy model with random transverse fields ( i.e. @xmath58 ) exponential decay of @xmath53 follows directly from single - particle localization in 1d , as proven rigorously in ref .",
    "however , at general @xmath55 the relation between growth of effective disorder upon rg and anderson localization is far from being obvious , since the rg calculation  @xcite does not contain any multiple - impurity interference effects , see  @xcite .",
    "below we will focus on delocalized phase @xmath44 , that corresponds to the range of @xmath59 , where renormalized disorder constant @xmath60 is small , and one can obtain transport properties using perturbation theory for bosonic ll model with renormalized parameters .",
    "here we proceed from the hamiltonian description defined by eqs.([eq : hll],[eq : hdis ] ) to the keldysh action for the ll model with disorder .",

    ". full green function then reads as follows : @xmath86      to obtain transport properties , one can apply kubo formulas .",
    "expressions for spin and energy currents can be derived from corresponding continuity equation @xmath87 ( index @xmath88 corresponds to either spin or energy ) , and using classical equations of motion . for the hamiltonian of the form @xmath89 , equations of motion",
    "reads as follows : @xmath90 so energy density obeys the following continuity equation : @xmath91 and similarly for spin density .",
    "considering total hamiltonian consisting of two contributions and , we arrive at the following expressions for currents : @xmath92 we emphasize that eqs .",
    "provide exact ( within luttinger liquid approximation ) expressions for both spin and thermal currents .",
    "surprisingly , in the ll approximation the energy current does not contain any terms related to the presence of backscattering . in appendix  [ appendixa ]",
    "we provide a detailed derivation of the energy current , starting from the lattice fermion model  , and show that backscattering does produce additional terms for the energy current , but these terms vanish in the continuous ll limit , when @xmath93 at some fixed value of the product @xmath94 .",

    "now we repeat the above calculations leading to nonzero @xmath139 and obtain drude - type formulae with corrected power - law exponent @xmath88 : @xmath140 the lorentz number is still given by eq.([lorentz ] ) once renormalization @xmath141 is taken into account .",

    "since our system is one - dimensional , some care should be exercised to check if the effects of quantum interference and anderson localization could affect that result . to begin with , it is useful to employ the result of ref.@xcite where the same issue was considered for disordered luttinger liquid with a weak interaction , @xmath143 .",
    "namely , it was found in  @xcite that interference corrections are negligible at sufficiently high temperatures @xmath144 .",
    "we are working at @xmath120 and the corresponding condition is just @xmath121 which is always fulfilled at low temperatures according to eq.([tau ] ) .    to estimate interference corrections more accurately , we examine expression for `` thermal susceptibility '' to higher order in @xmath68 adding impurity lines connecting upper and lower green functions drown in fig.3 .",
    "first order correction ( with single impurity line ) vanishes at zero external momentum due to gradient structure of energy current vertex .",
