    "in the majority of the events in hadron - hadron collisions an object exchanged between an interacting partons is a quark or a gluon .",
    "such exchange typically results in a multiparticle final state distributed over several units of rapidity .",
    "these types of interactions are not the only possibilities .",
    "an object exchanged in @xmath0-channel can be a colour - singlet .",
    "such process is expected to yield a rapidity gap , _",
    "i.e. _ a space in rapidity devoid of particles . one of the best candidates for such colour singlet is the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) pomeron @xcite .",
    "for more than 20 years a large effort has been devoted to understand the qcd dynamics of rapidity gaps in jet events when there is a rapidity gap between two high-@xmath1 jets .",
    "the diagram of such production is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diag_jgj ] .",
    "one can immediately realise that in such process both protons are destroyed and , due to the colour singlet exchange , no particles are produced between the leading jets .",
    "-channel is a colour singlet , therefore there is a gap in rapidity between two jets.,title=\"fig : \" ] + -channel is a colour singlet , therefore there is a gap in rapidity between two jets.,title=\"fig : \" ]    despite of the fact that the studies of jet - gap - jet events were performed at the tevatron , there is still no consensus on what the relevant qcd mechanism really is .",
    "the lhc accelerator opens a possibility to shed more light on this topic .",
    "the theoretical description of this process is discussed elsewhere ( @xcite and references within ) , whereas here only the main results are discussed .",
    "the d0 collaboration measured the jet - gap - jet event ratio , @xmath2 , defined as the ratio of the jet - gap - jet cross section to the inclusive di - jet cross section : @xmath3 this was done as a function of the transverse energy of the second - leading jet , @xmath4 , and as a function of the rapidity difference @xmath5 between the two leading jets @xcite . in the analysis , at least two jets were required to be reconstructed in the d0 calorimeter and the @xmath4 of the second leading was greater than 15 gev .",
    "in addition , the leading jets were required to be in the forward regions and in opposite pseudorapidity hemispheres .",
    "the comparison with the bfkl theoretical predictions was performed in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion was that there is a fair agreement between the nll - bfkl calculation and the data whereas the ll - bfkl calculation leads to an @xmath4 dependence which is too flat .",
    "however , due to the large experimental errors , the repetition of this test at the lhc accelerator is much desirable .",
    "both atlas and cms collaborations measured the fraction of events where there is no activity ( defined as lack of jets with @xmath6 @xmath7 20 gev ) between two leading jets @xcite .",
    "however , according to some theoretical studies ( _ eg .",
    "_ @xcite ) , this approach might not be sensitive to the bfkl effects .",
    "currently , there is an effort to repeat this measurement with veto on much lower @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the predictions of the jet - gap - jet event ratio with veto on generated particles at the lhc assume the following :    * the gap survival probability of 0.03 , * two leading jets on the opposite pseudorapidity hemispheres , * the transverse energy of the second leading jets , @xmath8 gev .",
    "the results , plotted in figure [ fig_pred ] , feature that the ratio is about 0.002 and does not vary a lot with @xmath4 .    .",
    "the discussed test of the bfkl pomeron can also be performed in a double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) type process ( see fig [ fig_diag_dpejgj ] ) , hereafter called the dpe jet - gap - jet . in dpe processes interacting protons",
    "stay intact , are scattered at very small angles ( of the order of microradians ) and stay within the accelerator beam pipe .",
    "the phenomenological formulation of the process as well as the implementation into the monte carlo generator is described in details in @xcite .",
    "-channel is a colour singlet , therefore there is a gap in rapidity between two jets.,title=\"fig : \" ] + -channel is a colour singlet , therefore there is a gap in rapidity between two jets.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to perform the dpe jet - gap - jet measurement , two kinds of detectors are needed ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig_scheme ] ) : the central detector ( for the jets detection ) and the very forward detectors ( for the proton tagging ) .",
    "the presented analysis assumes atlas as the central detector and the afp ( atlas forward physics ) as the proton tagging devices .",
    "since there are several lhc magnets between the atlas interaction point and the afp detectors , the proton trajectory depends not only on the scattering angle but also on the proton energy .",
    "obviously , not all forward protons can be measured in the afp detectors .",
    "such proton can be either too close to the beam to be detected or it can hit one of the lhc elements ( a collimator , the beam pipe ) before it reaches the forward detector . the afp geometric acceptance is shown in fig . [ fig_acceptance ] . in the calculation",
    "the following factors were taken into account :    * the beam properties at the ip , * the beam chamber geometry , * the distance between the detector edge and the beam centre .",
    "as can be observed , the region of acceptance is approximately limited by @xmath9 and @xmath10 4  gev / c , where @xmath11 ) is the relative energy loss and @xmath1 is the proton transverse momentum .    , and its transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) . ]",
    "since both protons need to be tagged in the afp stations , not all events can be recorded .",
    "the visible cross section depends on the distance between the afp active detector edge and the beam centre . in this paper",
    "a distance of 3.5 mm is assumed , which results in a visible cross section of about 1 nb ( for a leading jet heaving @xmath12 40 gev ) .      the jets produced in the dpe jgj process will be measured in the atlas central detector . to fulfil the atlas detector trigger ,",
    "the leading jet is requested to have a transverse momentum greater than 40 gev .",
    "this rather low value is realistic for the low pile - up lhc runs required ( due to the gap reconstruction ) to make this measurement possible . in the presented analysis",
    "the two leading jets are required to be in the opposite pseudorapidity hemispheres and the rapidity gap is required to be symmetric around zero .",
    "the main background for the dpe jet - gap - jet production will be dpe inclusive jet production . in the latter process",
    "a gap between the jets can appear due to the fluctuations , but this background is significantly reduced by requiring large enough gap sizes ( see fig [ fig_gap_dist ] ) .",
    "the bigger is the gap size , the larger is the dpe jet - gap - jet contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross - section falls steeply with the increase of the gap size .",
    "similarly as in the jgj case , one can define the dpe jet - gap - jet event ratio : @xmath13 this ratio is plotted in figure [ fig_dpe_pred ] as a function of the transverse momentum of the first - leading jet . to verify the power of this test",
    ", the statistical errors corresponding to 300 @xmath14 of integrated luminosity were plotted .    .",
    "]    as far as the gap fraction , @xmath2 , is concerned there is no need to consider an additional suppression factor for dpe jet - gap - jet production on top of the 0.03 of dpe inclusive jet production .",
    "therefore , in the predictions of fig . [ fig_dpe_pred ] , the rapidity gap survival probabilities cancel .",
    "the measurement of the jet - gap - jet event ratio , defined as the ratio of the jet - gap - jet cross section to the inclusive di - jet cross section was performed at the tevatron .",
    "the nll bfkl predictions seem to be in a good agreement with the data , but due to the large statistical uncertainties the repetition of this measurement at the lhc is desirable .    at the lhc , both atlas and cms measured the fraction of events where there is no activity ( defined as lack of jets with the transverse momentum greater than 20 gev ) between two leading jets . however , according to _ eg .",
    "_ @xcite , this approach might not be sensitive to the bfkl effects .",
    "the predictions for the lhc using veto on lower @xmath6 threshold are that this ratio is about 0.002 and does not vary a lot with the energy of the leading jet .    the colour singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel",
    "can also be observed in the dpe processes , which provides cleaner events not polluted by proton remnants , and consequently also gives access to events with a larger rapidity difference , for which bfkl effects are more important .",
    "in addition , the fraction of jet - gap - jet to inclusive di - jets events in dpe processes is larger than the corresponding fraction in non - diffractive processes , since the ratio is not penalized by the gap survival probability .",
    "the predictions for the lhc , with atlas as the central detector and the afp as the proton tagging devices , are that there will be enough statistics in 300 @xmath14 of data to collect a significant sample of dpe jet - gap - jet events .",
    "this would provide an additional test of the bfkl pomeron .",
