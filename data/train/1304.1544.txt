    "comet lovejoy ( c/2011 w3 ) is the most significant sungrazer since the launch of the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; @xcite ) and the first to be detected by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) aboard hinode @xcite .",
    "its perihelion passage brought the comet to within just 0.2 rtextsubscript@xmath0 of the photosphere , providing an unprecedented glimpse of a large comet immersed in the lower corona .",
    "lovejoy is a member of the kreutz family of sungrazing comets , which account for a majority of all sungrazers and are observed in large numbers each year by the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ; @xcite ) .",
    "soho s large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; @xcite ) has proven a superb discoverer of these objects @xcite , having imaged over 1800 , and the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ; @xcite ) has returned spectra from several kreutz members @xcite .",
    "the group is thought to have been formed from the successive fragmentation of a single progenitor as little as 2500 years ago @xcite and is principally comprised of meter - sized objects that are most often destroyed well before perihelion @xcite . until lovejoy ,",
    "none of the kreutz members observed by soho have survived to emerge from behind the occulting disk of the coronagraph @xcite .",
    "a few have made it into the lower corona , but it was not until the launch of sdo in 2010 that they could be followed using the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported the first such observation , which witnessed the destruction of kreutz fragment c/2011 n3 in july of 2011 about midway through its transit of the solar disk .",
    "when lovejoy followed five months later , it seemed that it would likely meet the same fate , this time behind the sun from aia s perspective .",
    "instead , the comet emerged from behind the limb just moments after sdo had finished slewing to its usual disk - center pointing after being off - pointed to observe the ingress .",
    "exactly how a comet like c/2011 w3 is able to survive its closest approach is still not entirely clear , largely because there is uncertainty regarding its size and composition .",
    "based on the visible magnitude well before perihelion , the nucleus is expected to have been less than @xmath11 km in diameter @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimates from soho / uvcs suggest a diameter of 400 m upon reaching 6.8 rtextsubscript@xmath0 during the ingress @xcite . finally ,",
    "after having seemingly escaped , the nucleus was destroyed at @xmath131 rtextsubscript@xmath0 , 1.6 days past perihelion @xcite . from mass lost arguments using the visible brightness of the dust tail , @xcite estimate that the diameter of the nucleus was on order 200 m at the time of its destruction .",
    "if the comet s makeup was consistent with the canonical  rubble pile \" model , then the tidal forces within the sun s roche lobe should have torn it apart opposed only to self gravity and a meager tensile strength .",
    "@xcite explore this possibility and suggest that the cohesive pressure exerted by near - isotropic outgassing could be a sufficient counter to the tidal forces .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the delayed destruction of the nucleus is evidence that the comet was no  rubble pile \" and possessed tensile strength appreciable enough to remain structurally unperturbed by tidal forces .",
    "they suggest that the thermal stresses experienced as the comet swept into the lower corona would have taken time to propagate into the interior , after which pockets of water ice would have exploded upon reaching @xmath1130 k due to an exothermic reaction related to the crystallization of amorphous ice @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the comet is destroyed by successive , large fragmentation events rather than steady outgassing . @xcite",
    "include a discussion of preliminary results from the work presented here , which they explain in the context of their fragmentation model .",
    "we will revisit this in  [ outbursts ] .",
    "c/2011 w3 is the first comet to have been detected by a solar x - ray imager , but it is not the first comet to exhibit x - rays at all .",
    "sixteen years ago , @xcite reported the puzzling detection of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray emission from comet c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) using the x - ray telescope aboard rosat .",
    "shortly thereafter , such emission was found to emanate from any comet within 3 au @xcite . @xcite and @xcite explained that this high - energy emission arose from charge exchange between solar wind ions and the neutral gas of cometary atmospheres , which are much too cold to produce such energetic photons on their own .",
    "but any neutral species are quickly ionized within the aia and xrt fields of view , so a different mechanism is needed to explain the emission described here .    in their work on the aforementioned c/2011 n3 , @xcite noted that the euv emission could be explained by ionization and excitation states experienced as shed cometary material equilibrated with coronal plasma .",
    "@xcite expanded upon this by providing a detailed summary of the means by which sublimated cometary molecules are destroyed and ionized .",
    "they constructed a time - dependent model of the cometary emission using a simple geometry and determined which ionization states of which elements would contribute to aia s euv channels , noting that these differ significantly from the lines typically important to aia observations .",
    "we adopt the scenario proposed by @xcite and @xcite and assume that the euv and x - ray emission arises from the ionization of cometary material after it is immersed in the corona .",
    "sublimated molecules flow into the coma at velocities of at least a few km stextsuperscript-1 @xcite and are swiftly photodissociated into their atomic constituents .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that water dominates the composition of this material , and since hydrogen does not contribute significantly to any of our passbands , our observations can be largely characterized by which charge states of oxygen contribute most to the various channels .",
    "we identify the dominant lines in each of our passbands in  [ observations ] , which also includes a more thorough discussion of the @xcite model and how our results compare to theirs .",
    "this paper is structured as follows :  [ observations ] describes our observations , the means by which cometary flux was extracted from the coronal background , and the source of euv and x - ray photons . in ",
    "[ dem ] , we use a differential emission measure to probe the coronal environment , and  [ outgassing ]",
    "details our calculations of outgassing rates from the observed fluxes .",
    "the foremost extent of the emission in each channel and the expected position of the nucleus are given in  [ positions ] .",
    " [ angle ] includes consideration for the 171  opening angle , and  [ time ] examines time evolution over the egress again using the 171  observations .",
    "we discuss our work in the context of others in  [ discussion ] .",
    "this includes commentary on the @xcite outburst model , the source of neutral oxygen ( water ice vs. dust grains ) , how our results compare with those of @xcite for comet c/2011 n3 , and what our results imply about the size of the nucleus .",
    "finally ,  [ conclusion ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the observations reported here were taken on december 16 , 2011 during the egress of comet lovejoy , after it had emerged from behind the solar disk having survived perihelion .",
    "figure  [ fig : rfilter ] provides an overview of our dataset by overlaying six 171  aia images at different times .",
    "these images were produced using a radial filteraia_rfilter@xmath3 .",
    "] , which allows us to see the development of both cometary and coronal emission in one coherent set of images .",
    "see our online material for the corresponding movie .",
    "sdo / aia records images with a 12 s cadence in seven narrowband euv channels ( 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 304 , & 335  ) and with a lower cadence in 3 uv bands ( 1600 , 1700 , & 4500  ) .",
    "the resolution is 0.6per pixel over a 4096@xmath44096 px ccd .",
    "detections were made in each channel with the exceptions of the 94 , 1700 , and 4500  bands .",
    "hinode / xrt made successful observations using its thinnest soft x - ray filter , al - mesh , and recorded non - detections using two thicker filters ( be - med & al - med ) .",
    "these observations had a cadence of 7 s and a resolution of 2.06per pixel .",
    "the dominant ions contributing to each channel are listed in table  [ tab : ions ] , and discussion of how we arrived at these is given in the next two sections .",
    "our analysis focuses primarily on a single set of images centered around 00:46:12 ut ( position 4 of fig  [ fig : rfilter ] ) , which is about 30 minutes after perihelion and corresponds to a height above the photosphere of about 0.56 rtextsubscript@xmath0 ( @xmath1320,000 km ) .",
    "this height and those quoted later are determined from the most recent ephemeris solution ; see  [ positions ] for additional discussion of the expected trajectory .",
    "we chose this time for a strong xrt signal and maximum temporal alignment between xrt and the aia/171 channel , which was important for characterizing the x - ray production ( see  [ xrt ] ) .",
    "the thin xrt filters are also affected by ccd contamination spots that attenuate longer x - ray wavelengths , and so this time was also chosen because the location of the comet is free of contamination .",
    "there are a number of interesting features and morphological developments to note as the comet progresses through the aia field - of - view ( fov ) during the egress .",
    "these include apparent interactions with the coronal magnetic field ( * b * ) and spikes in the measured intensity .",
    "we will revisit these topics in  [ time ] , where we consider time evolution using only the 171  observations .",
    "background subtraction was necessary to separate cometary and coronal emission .",
    "the backgrounds were constructed from averages of 10 frames , 5 before and 5 after the comet appeared within a @xmath1100 region surrounding the emission . before subtraction , the backgrounds were smoothed using a 5x5 pixel boxcar average to limit the introduction of additional noise .",
    "minor over- and under - subtractions related to intensity gradients across the background frames were accounted for by removing a subsequent linear fit to the column and row averages outside the comet region .",
    "background subtracted images for each channel are displayed in figure  [ fig : images ] .    to extract counts from the comet without including unnecessary background pixels , the flux was taken from a region contoured to the shape of the emission .",
    "this was done by thresholding the subtracted images , selecting contiguous pixels , and dilating the resulting mask until it comfortably included all observed emission .",
    "columns 4 and 5 of table  [ tab : flux ] list the results of this .",
    "column 4 includes fluxes integrated over a single , all - encompassing ( global ) mask , while the values in column 5 were derived from masks individually contoured to the emission in each channel .",
    "note that if the background subtraction were perfect , columns 4 and 5 would be equivalent .",
    "the quoted errors reflect statistical uncertainties based on the total counts recorded for comet and background , along with an additional term that attempts to quantify error from the background removal using the rms noise outside of the comet region after background subtraction .",
    "columns 6 and 7 list the percentage of the total flux that is attributed to the comet using the global and individual masks , respectively .",
    "note that the difference between these two values is reflective of both the extent of the cometary emission in a given channel and the intensity of the background .",
    "values for the cometary portion of the total flux range between just 3% for the xrt observation and 43% for aia/131  .",

    "we have assumed that the bulk of the sublimated material is water , and since the soon - ionized hydrogen does not contribute significantly to any of the aia bands , oxygen is the most important atom to consider ( see  [ oxygen ] for additional discussion on the source of neutral oxygen ) .    to this end , we have used version 6 of the chianti spectroscopic database @xcite , coupled with the effective areas of the aia filters , to determine which o lines dominate each channel .",
    "these results are listed in table  [ tab : ions ] , and some additional discussion of the emission process is given in  [ outgassing ] .",
    "note that there are no significant o lines covered by the 1600  uv filter , and for this we expect that the emission arises principally from c iv .",
    "also note that morphological differences between the bands , specifically the length of the tail , result mainly from differences in the ionization times .",
    "as we will describe in  [ outgassing ] , a neutral o atom is stripped of its first electron in about one tenth of a second after being dropped into the coronal plasma .",
    "the ionization rate of each subsequent state decreases by a factor of 35 , and so channels dominated by low charge states ( 1600 & 304  ) exhibit shorter tails because these states do not persist for long before ionizing into the next stage .",
    "similarly , the intermediate , o iv image ( 211  ) shows an intermediate extent , and likewise for the higher ionization states .    the o vi emission exhibited by the 171 and 131  bands will persist until the atoms progress to o vii or the comet - related densities have sufficiently diffused into the coronal background .",
    "the next section will show that xrt likely sees material that has indeed made it to o vii , but as will be described in  [ 131335 ] , we suspect that this occurs for only about 1/3 of the o vi atoms .",
    "examination of the o vi images suggests that the cometary material becomes indistinguishable from the background after about two minutes near 00:46:12 ut . this time is greatly extended further along in the dataset , likely due to a lower coronal density ; see  [ morph ] for additional details .",
    "a more complete assessment of the cometary emission observed by aia has been carried out by @xcite , who conducted a full , time - dependent analysis with a simple geometry .",
    "the coma was modeled as a cylinder populated by concentric shells of successive ionic species , which form as material from the nucleus is sublimated and ionized .",
    "once immersed in the corona , cometary atoms may be ionized in several ways ; @xcite include considerations for charge exchange , electron- and proton - impact , and photoionization .",
    "each of these effects is examined for the most abundant elements determined for comet 1p / halley by @xcite , which include h , o , c , n , si , fe , mg , and s ( listed here in order of descending abundance ) . the lines relevant to aia are identified and displayed in a series of figures showing their emission versus typical quiet - sun conditions .",
    "@xcite find that the emission in most channels is dominated by oxygen , and the o ions they identify are consistent with what we present in table  [ tab : ions ] based on our more simplistic approach .",
    "the only exception to this is the 335  band , for which we find the o vi lines near 131  to dominate over the o iii lines near 335  .",
    "we will discuss this further in  [ 131335 ] .",
    "@xcite find no significant emission from h , c , n , si , mg , or s. they do , however , find that iron contributes significantly to the 171  ( by @xmath140% ) and 131  ( @xmath125% ) channels .",
    "( the 94  channel is also found to be dominated by fe , but a reliable signal was not detected at this wavelength . ) the relative contributions of o and fe in their model depend somewhat on outflow velocity , for which 17 km stextsuperscript-1 is used based on observations of c/2011 n3 .",
    "this dependence is characterized in figure 10 of their paper and may also be important to our discussion on the source of neutral oxygen in  [ oxygen ] .",
    "careful alignment reveals the xrt emission to be offset from aia . as outgassed material ionizes ,",
    "its motion soon becomes dominated by the local magnetic field .",
    "newly formed plasma from the comet can be observed drifting along field lines in various directions throughout the aia dataset ( see  [ morph ] for additional details ) . at 00:46:12 ut",
    ", this motion is in a southwest direction that matches the observed offset between nearly simultaneous aia and xrt images .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : overlay ] .",
    "the upper panel shows three successive aia/171 images to establish the direction of motion along the * b * field , while the lower panel shows the xrt offset .",
    "the aia and xrt images in the lower panel have identical start times and are temporally separated only by their respective exposure times of 2.9 and 4.1 s. given that the motion along the dotted line in fig  [ fig : overlay ] is about 0.2@xmath8 stextsuperscript-1 , the longer xrt exposure can not explain the offset .",
    "we suggest that xrt is seeing material that has flowed down the field lines and further equilibrated with coronal plasma , reaching an ionization state not visible in aia .",
    "the likeliest candidate for this emission is o vii ( 22.1 , 21.6  ) , which lies near the peak sensitivity of the al - mesh filter , the wavelength response of which is given in figure  [ fig : xrtres ] .",
    "unlike aia , xrt is a broadband instrument , and al - mesh has some sensitivity to each of the lines contributing to aia s euv channels . given the considerable signal exhibited by the 171  band in particular , it was initially suspected that the faint xrt signal was also due to euv emission .",
    "but the effective area at these lines is down by a factor of @xmath9100 compared to o vii , and the lower ionization states can not explain the observed offset .",
    "such an offset would be expected from o vii because of the much longer ionization time compared to o vi ( see  [ positions ] for additional discussion of positional offsets between the emission in each passband ) .",
    "o vii is a line typical of a moderately active corona .",
    "its temperature distribution function g(t ) is peaked around 10textsuperscript6.3 k with a fwhm of about 1.9 mk . as will be described in ",
    "[ dem ] , we find a coronal temperature profile surrounding the comet that is peaked at 10textsuperscript6.12 k , which would be high enough to generate o vii",
    ". it should be noted , however , that g(t ) is calculated assuming ionization equilibrium .",
    "this assumption can not be made for the cometary emission , but overlap between g(t ) and the coronal temperature profile nonetheless provides some expectation of o vii formation .",

    "likewise , an iron contribution to the 131  channel would also bring that result closer the 335  value , but whether or not this helps the overall variance depends on the issues discussed in  [ 131335 ] .",
    "it is also possible that additional lines unaccounted for in the chianti database are contributing to the observed fluxes , and uncertainties in the calibration of the aia response to the ions in table  [ tab : ions ] could be important .",

    "focal - plane filters are used to select the active channel , but the 335  filter does not fully reject 131  light @xcite .",
    "this is generally a minor effect but is important here because the o iii lines near 335  are much weaker than their o vi counterparts near 131  .",

    "if the 131  contribution _ is _ included , then the 335 and 131  results agree fairly well with each other , particularly given the 131  fe contribution that has not been included and the low 335  signal - to - noise .",
    "regardless of the 335  response , the low 131  outgassing result must be reconciled with those of the other bands since the atomic rates for o vi should be reliable .    one way to account for this",
    "is to assume that , while most of the oxygen atoms progress all the way from o iii through o vi , only about 1/3 of them are ionized from o vi to o vii , so that the intensity of the o vi line is only about 1/3 of the value assumed in column 2 of table  [ tab : flux ] . this is plausible in that we are looking at a set of images dominated by a short - lived outburst ( see  [ outbursts ] ) , and the ionization time of o vi is 3@xmath4 longer than that of o v , which is in turn 4@xmath4 longer than that of o iv .",
    "o vi lines also contribute to the 171  band @xcite , so @xmath15 from 171 would have to be increased by perhaps 20% , but this is offset by the fe ix contribution that we have not included .",
    "if that interpretation is right , @xmath15 around 10textsuperscript32.5 matches all the bands to within a factor of @xmath11.5 .",
    "it implies that less of the oxygen has reached o vii than we had assumed , so a somewhat higher density would be required to account for the xrt count rate .",
    "a more complete model of the outgassing rate during the outburst and the time - dependent ionization would improve the estimates , but atomic rate uncertainties of @xmath130% and aia calibration uncertainties limit the ultimate attainable accuracy .    it should also be noted that a higher temperature due to thermalization of kinetic energy from cometary ions would decrease the o vi emissivity relative to that of the other ions somewhat , but not very strongly . however , this would increase the o vii emissivity and the xrt count rate dramatically .",
    "the westernmost , leading tip of the emission in each channel was determined manually , and the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : tips ] .",
    "trajectory information is derived from the jpl orbit solution # 58 and extracted using the horizons ephemeris generator . since minor differences in the tip positions can be informative , a few considerations are particularly important .",
    "translational , rotational , and scaling offsets between the four aia telescopes are accounted for using the @xmath11aia_prep@xmath3 software in solarsoft .",
    "we have used the latest version of this code , which includes refinements to the the telescope offsets resulting from the 2012 transit of venus observations . the xrt observations were scaled to aia s pixel size , rotated to match , and carefully aligned to the limb and on - disk features .",
    "because the comet is traveling at @xmath10.7stextsuperscript-1 and the observations are spread over 12 s , it is necessary to shift the tip positions found after co - alignment to account for the different observation and exposure times .",
    "shifts were determined using the temporal offsets between the images and the expected motion of the comet according to the jpl ephemeris , which is given as a dotted line in figure  [ fig : tips ] .",
    "note that the resolution of aia is 0.6pxtextsuperscript-1 and the alignment between the telescopes is likely good to within 1 - 2 pixels .",
    "thus , the @xmath10.8offset between the 131 ( light blue ) and 171  ( pink ) positions , for instance , is close to the uncertainty from resolution and spatial alignment .",
    "the resultant positions arrange themselves almost exactly as would be expected from emission dominated by the ions listed in table  [ tab : ions ] .",
    "an exception to this is the 335  position .",
    "this appears consistent with emission from o iii , but as we describe in  [ 131335 ] , we expect this channel to be dominated by o vi .",
    "this is a curious but not overly concerning result because , as is evident in fig  [ fig : images ] , the 335  band has very low signal - to - noise , making a precise measurement of the tip position difficult .",
    "c iv ( 1600  ) is the first to appear , taking @xmath11.7 s to reach the fourth ionization stage after being sublimated , given a coronal electron density of 10textsuperscript8 cmtextsuperscript-3 and log(t ) = 6.15 k. the separation from the nucleus should be @xmath10.25@xmath4 the length of the 1600  tail , or about 3.25 . along a linear fit through tip positions from each passband ,",
    "the distance between the 1600  tip and the orbital path is @xmath13.5 .",
    "we therefore see about a 28 s delay between the expected nucleus position and that suggested by the aia observations .",
    "the solar optical telescope ( sot ) aboard hinode also observed the comet during its ingress on the opposite side of the solar disk .",
    "the observed position was precisely along the expected orbital path but @xmath133.5 s behind the predicted position .",
    "the extrapolated sot position based on this delay is denoted by a triangle in figure  [ fig : tips ] , and one can see much better agreement between this position and the expectation from aia .",
    "ground - based observations well outside perihelion were used to construct the ephemeris , so the solution very near the sun may suffer a small timing error as a result .",
    "it should be also be noted that the orbit determination for comet lovejoy is still ongoing , so agreement between the ephemeris and the solar telescope observations will likely improve .",
    "the distance ( d ) between the tips seen in o iii and vi ( 304 and 131  ) can also be used to estimate the density of the emitting plasma : @xmath23 where the ionization rate coefficients qtextsubscript are those given in table  [ tab : ions ] . following from this , we find an electron density of @xmath11.4@xmath24 cmtextsuperscript-3 .",
    "the opening angle of the tail is informative of the interplay between outgassed material and the local magnetic field",
    ". it can be well - measured in the 171  images , which exhibit the highest signal - to - noise . to do this",
    ", we manually determine a vector that roughly bisects the emission and is perpendicular to the striations along which cometary material is collected by the magnetic field ( further discussion of these striations can be found in  [ morph ] ) .",
    "the emission is then divided into slices perpendicular to this vector , a gaussian is fit to the emission along each slice , and the width of the comet at each location is determined by the distance between the 3-@xmath25 levels on either side of the gaussian distribution . from this , we find the opening angle of the 171  emission at 00:46:12 ut to be 12.8@xmath26 .    for lyman - alpha images of sungrazing comets at larger heights , the interpretation of the opening angle is straightforward @xcite : hydrogen atoms from the dissociation of cometary water exchange electrons with coronal protons , producing a cloud of neutrals that have the temperature and velocity of the local coronal environment .",
    "the cloud expands at the thermal speed , producing a cone with opening angle tantextsuperscript-1(@xmath27textsubscript/@xmath27textsubscript ) .",
    "the case of comet lovejoy is more complex .",
    "an oxygen atom is moving at @xmath27textsubscript upon release from the nucleus .",
    "as it becomes ionized and begins to interact with the coronal magnetic field , the o atom behaves like a pickup ion in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the velocity component perpendicular to the field becomes a gyration speed , @xmath28 , and the parallel component is conserved as @xmath29 .",
    "since all the ions have nearly the same speed , they form a tight ring in velocity space .",
    "this ring distribution is very unstable and quickly scatters into a bispherical shell distribution with components of two intersecting shells centered at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "thus , after deprojection from plane - of - the - sky to true values , the angle between the comet s path and the center of its tail gives @xmath29 / @xmath27textsubscript . and",
    "the opening angle of the tail gives the width of the bispherical distribution , which depends on @xmath31 , @xmath27textsubscript , and the angle between @xmath27textsubscript and * b*. that analysis is beyond the scope of this paper because it requires knowledge of the * b * field direction and because the bispherical shell may further scatter , exchanging energy and momentum with the coronal plasma .",
    "this section is intended as a prelude to future work that will cover the time evolution of comet lovejoy in more detail . here",
    "we make some qualitative remarks about morphological developments during the egress , followed by a quantitative analysis of the aia/171 flux versus time .      a number of interesting features in this dataset bear mentioning .",
    "we do so here with references to the positions labeled in figure  [ fig : rfilter ] , but readers would be best served by http://aia.cfa.harvard.edu/movies/comet_lovejoy_egress_171.mp4[downloading the corresponding movie ] available in our online material . traveling roughly horizontally with respect to the fov , the comet emerged from behind the limb @xmath125 min after perihelion .",
    "interaction between shed cometary material and the local magnetic field is immediately apparent , as a parcel of newly - formed plasma can be seen traveling away from the sun along a radial field system near position 1 .",
    "ionized cometary material will tend to spiral along field lines with a speed that depends on @xmath27textsubscript and the angle between @xmath27textsubscript and * b*. for this initial interaction , the component of @xmath27textsubscript along * b * appears to be greatest , so we observe the swiftest motion of cometary material along field lines here .",
    "similar , but slower , motions can be observed near positions 4 and 5 in a southwestern direction and in a northwestern direction near position 6 .    in position 2",
    ", we see the tail stretched out in a slight , inverted u - shape .",
    "this appears to be the comet skimming overtop of underlying loops , but modeling of the magnetic field will be needed to understand this .",
    "the same is true for the vertical striations that become most pronounced after position 4 , which can be interpreted as newly formed plasma being arranged along field lines . as was pointed out by @xcite , such striations are also visible during the ingress .",
    "other groups are working on magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling of this system , and it will be interesting to see how closely correlated these striations are with the model field predictions .",
    "position 6 shows the last frame for which the leading edge of the euv emission can be traced before it has left the fov .",
    "this occurs at about 00:56:00 ut when the comet is @xmath10.56 rtextsubscript@xmath0 above the photosphere .",
    "emission visible in the radial filter movie lingers along the striations at this position for another @xmath140 minutes .",
    "the motion of these striations during this period is very interesting , with the roughly vertical threads pulling apart and moving together in a manner reminiscent of aurorae on earth .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxtime ] quantifies the 171  brightness over a 40-minute period from 00:41:24 through 01:22:24 ut .",
    "this begins about 25 minutes after perihelion , corresponding to a height of @xmath10.46 rtextsubscript@xmath0 above the photosphere , and ends @xmath126 minutes after the leading edge of the tail has left the fov .",
    "the solid line in the left panel shows the total flux extracted after background subtraction from a region contoured to fit the cometary emission .",
    "the dashed line indicates the total background flux from the same region , and the dotted line shows the area of this region in pixels .",
    "the background subtraction and region selection for this analysis was done in the same manner as described in  [ observations ] with some modifications . since the tail s extent and position changes from frame - to - frame , a new  comet region \" ( mask ) must be selected for each image . to make the evolution of this region as continuous as possible , the mask for each frame was taken from the previous image and adjusted to fit the new extent .",
    "the dotted line in the left panel of fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] indicates the area of this mask , showing the dramatic rise of the emission s extent as time progresses .",
    "note that the background flux in the left panel ( dashed line ) is largely dependent on the area indicated by the dotted line .",
    "though coronal emission falls off exponentially with radial distance , the size of the comet mask increases nearly as fast , yielding a relatively constant background flux when integrated over the entire region .    to display these data in a manner independent of the mask size",
    ", the right panel of fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] shows the cometary flux integrated over only the 500 brightest pixels in the the selected region ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed line again shows the background flux integrated over the same pixels used for the solid line .",
    "since a constant area is being used , the background curve drops off as would be expected of the corona .",
    "as previously noted , the leading edge of the tail can be seen exiting the fov at about 00:56:00 ut , which corresponds to a local maximum in the comet s flux as shown in the left panel of fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] . after this time , lingering emission drifts about for many minutes confined to a region somewhat larger than the extent indicated by position 6 in fig  [ fig : rfilter ] .",
    "the frame - by - frame evolution of the comet mask is discontinued after 01:02:00 ut in favor of a constant region ; the flat portion of the dotted line in the left panel of fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] results from this .",
    "we find the aia/171 brightness to be characterized by three distinct peaks and leave their interpretation to the proceeding section , where we discuss the profiles shown in fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] in the context of the outburst model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the total integrated emission under the flux vs. time plot in fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] is log(i ) = 7.609 dn , which implies to a total outgassing of 10textsuperscript35.53 oxygen atoms based on the 171  production rates listed in table  [ tab : flux ] .",
    "note that in applying the table  [ tab : flux ] rates to the integrated flux , we are in effect assuming that the corona is of uniform temperature and density throughout the aia fov .",
    "if entirely from water , our total outgassing result translates to a mass loss of @xmath11.0@xmath32 g. for comparison , @xcite used dust observations to estimate a residual mass of the nucleus of @xmath11@xmath33 g after its destruction 1.6 days post - perihelion at 31 rtextsubscript@xmath0",
    ". we will discuss the implications of our mass loss estimate on the expected size of the nucleus in  [ nucleus ] .",
    "@xcite used preliminary results from this study , presented at the 2012 summer aas meeting , to test their model for the process by which comet lovejoy s nucleus may have been destroyed , which was touched on in  [ intro ] . in summary , they contend that the nuclei of sungrazers like this one are principally destroyed through successive , large fragmentation events , rather than by steady outgassing . as heat propagates into the interior of the nucleus , pockets of water ice",
    "explode , calving off large chunks of material in outburst events .",
    "this results from an exothermic reaction triggered by the crystallization of amorphous ice at a critical temperature of @xmath1130 k @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation is significant to our general understanding of cometary compositions because it implies that the nucleus has a tensile strength far greater than what would be implied by the canonical  rubble pile \" model .    in our aas poster",

    "[ outgassing ] at three times ( 2012/11/16 00:44:12 , 00:46:12 , and 00:48:12 ut ) , and these results began to trace out the second of the two sharp peaks in fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] .",
    "@xcite note that these rates could not be sustained by a sub - kilometer nucleus for very long .",
    "instead they suggest that without drastically increasing the expected size of the nucleus , our results could only be explained in the context of an outburst , perhaps one of the four post - perihelion events that they suspect ultimately led to the total destruction of the nucleus .    with the fuller analysis presented in ",
    "[ fluxvtime ] , we see that the 171  intensity is characterized by three distinct peaks , the first two of which are sharp spikes that occur while the emission is confined to a relatively compact region spanning less than @xmath150@xmath8 . these are centered near 00:43:00 and 00:47:00 ut , respectively , and we find them to be consistent with the outburst model proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from the two - peaked profile that material was expelled from the nucleus in distinct phases , but whether or not this implies explosions in distinct pockets of water ice is unclear .",
    "further evidence for the outburst scenario may be found in the relative contributions of o and fe to the observed emission .",
    "this would be informative of the source of neutral oxygen , which may be either water ice ( as we have assumed ) or dust grains ( as proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss these possibilities in the next section .",
    "though the overall intensity of the third peak at 00:56:00 ut is comparable to the first two , the emission is far more diffuse and the rise more gradual than the earlier peaks , which are dominated by dense collections of very bright pixels .",
    "if the first two spikes are the result of outbursts that ejected large volumes of material from the nucleus , then we speculate that third peak may arise from more gradual outgassing through newly opened vents .",
    "since the front of the tail leaves the fov at the time of the third peak , we may also be seeing the beginning of a much longer rise phase .",
    "even if this were true , the nature of this event does not appear to be quite the same as the first two because dense concentrations of material are not observed .",
    "there is also a question of why the emission lingers for so long near the fov edge when this behavior is not found to the same extent earlier .",
    "we suspect this to be primarily a result of density contrast .",
    "the coronal density is likely much less at this location than closer in , so the time it takes for the cometary material to diffuse into the background is much longer .",
    "this is coupled with the fact that a lower density and likely temperature will increase ionization times , so we see material progressing into and leaving the charge states observable at 171  more slowly .",
    "@xcite have suggested that much of the oxygen seen in the aia images originates from the vaporization of cometary dust grains rather than sublimation of water ice . from an observational standpoint",
    ", the two possibilities can be distinguished if the very high abundances of si , mg , and fe relative to o in dust imply significant emission in some of the aia channels .",
    "we take the mg : si and fe : si abundance ratios to be 0.69 , as did @xcite based on the abundances in comet halley @xcite . assuming that the si : o ratio is 0.5 , we used version 7 of chianti @xcite to compute contributions of the refractory elements .",
    "this ratio is what we would expect if the dominant oxygen source is dust grains ; note that it is an order of magnitude higher than what we reference in  [ outgassing ] .",
    "si would produce only 10% increases in the aia bands except for the 94  band , where it would provide a large fractional increase but still leave the emission at an undetectable level .",
    "mg would increase the brightness in the 304 and 335  bands by about a factor of 3 , which would aggravate the disagreement among the channels .",
    "it would also make the 304  image appear longer and more displaced from the comet nucleus than observed .",
    "if we assume that ntextsubscriptt is large enough to ionize o through o vi , it will also ionize fe through fe ix . in that case , fe viii and fe",
    "ix make substantial contributions to a few bands , particularly at 171  .",
    "a modest contribution reduces the discrepancy among the channels , but if the oxygen comes from dust grains , the expected iron levels would increase the 171  brightness by a factor of six , pushing it out of line with the other channels .",
    "an fe : o ratio of about 0.05 seems to give the best agreement , suggesting a grain - to - water ratio of about 1/6 .",
    "this is in line with the si : h ratio obtained from the uvcs spectrum at 2 rtextsubscript@xmath0 during the ingress @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this discussion pertains to the frames we have analyzed in detail .",
    "these were centered around 00:46:12 ut , which lies near the peak intensity indicated by fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] .",
    "we have suggested that this peak is consistent with the outburst scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "if true , then the intensity spike results from the explosion of an interior pocket of water ice that blew off a chunk of the nucleus . @xcite point to dust grains as the primary source of neutral oxygen because they suspect most surface ice to have already been sublimated away by the time of these observations , with the only significant source of htextsubscript2o left being these interior reservoirs .",
    "if this type of outburst is manifested in the aia data , then presumably the ejecta contains high concentrations of water , which would be consistent with our results .",
    "it may also be true that when not in an outburst phase , the primary source of neutral oxygen is indeed dust grains .",
    "as we have just described , this could be determined by the relative contribution of fe implied by outgassing rates derived near a minimum in the overall intensity versus that found for the maximum period this paper has focused on .",
    "if dust was found to be the dominant source of neutral o outside of the peak phase , this would also strengthen the notion that the intensity spike results from an explosion of interior water ice .",
    "these questions will be addressed in a followup study that will cover time evolution in more detail .      as has been previously mentioned ,",
    "the first sungrazing comet observed by aia came a few months prior to lovejoy when fellow kreutz member c/2011 n3 burned up midway through its transit of the solar disk .",
    "these results were published by @xcite , which was discussed briefly in  [ intro ] . as with lovejoy , emission from c/2011 n3",
    "was detected in all of aia s euv channels except at 94  .",
    "@xcite also estimated the mass loss of c/2011 n3 but did so in a very different manner than through the outgassing calculations presented here .",
    "they measured the deceleration of material lost from the nucleus and coupled this with the comet s orbital trajectory and approximate knowledge of the coronal plasma density to estimate a mass loss rate of ( 0.01 - 1)@xmath24 g stextsuperscript-1 over the duration of the comet s visibility to aia .",
    "this amounted to a total mass loss of @xmath16@xmath24 to 6@xmath34 g.    in  [ outgassing ] , we estimate an average @xmath15 of 10textsuperscript32.5 across the aia channels for the c/2011 w3 at 00:46:12 ut . assuming all this comes from water , we have a mass loss rate of @xmath19.5@xmath2 g stextsuperscript-1 ( see  [ oxygen ] for discussion on the source of neutral o ) .",
    "note that this time lies near the peak intensity indicated by fig  [ fig : fluxtime ] . aside from the first few frames , for which some of the emission may be hidden behind the solar disk , the minimum intensity observed before the leading edge of the 171  emission exited the fov occurred at 00:52:24 ut and was down by a factor of @xmath13.2x from 46:12 . for this time",

    "allowing for some outgassing after the comet left the aia field - of - view , we find that the nucleus was at least 400 m in diameter when our observations begin , 25 minutes post - perihelion .",
    "our mass loss estimate then corresponds to the erosion of a @xmath173 m layer from the surface , leaving the nucleus with a diameter of @xmath1254 m when it exits the aia fov . at this size ,",
    "another @xmath1(1.72.7)@xmath33 g of material could be lost before reaching the 150200 m diameter found by @xcite .    considering the unknown amount of mass lost behind the sun and on ingress , the nucleus",
    "may then have been around 600 m in diameter before the encounter .",

    "[  [ outbursts ] ]",
    "* we dispute the notion presented by @xcite that the o ions observed around 00:46:12 ut arise principally from vaporized dust grains rather than sublimated water .",
    "we base this on the relative outgassing rates found , noting that the 171  brightness should be much greater if the o atoms come from dust because of the much higher fe contribution implied .",
    "[  [ oxygen ] ] * comparing our results to those of @xcite for c/2011 n3 , we find a peak mass loss rate that is over an order of magnitude greater for comet lovejoy ( 9.5@xmath2 vs. 1@xmath24 g stextsuperscript-1 ) , which is consistent with expectations based on lovejoy s much larger size . [  [ n3 ] ] * based on our total mass loss estimate of 10textsuperscript13 g , we suggest that the nucleus was at least 400 m in diameter at the start of our observations , 25 min after perihelion . at a bulk density of 0.4 g cmtextsuperscript-3 ,",

    "several groups continue to work on this dataset , and a followup to this study will be prepared in the coming year .",
    "aia and xrt are also poised to obtain similar images for the upcoming perihelion passage of comet 2012 s1 ( ison ) , which appears to be 5 to 10 times larger than lovejoy and will reach its closet approach on november 28th , 2013 .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of euv and soft x - ray emission detected toward comet lovejoy ( c/2011 w3 ) during its post - perihelion traverse of the solar corona on december 16 , 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> observations were recorded by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) aboard the solar dynamics observatory and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) aboard hinode . </S>",
    "<S> a single set of contemporaneous images is explored in detail , along with prefatory consideration for time evolution using only the 171  data . for each of the eight passbands , </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the emission and derive outgassing rates where applicable . as material sublimates from the nucleus and is immersed in coronal plasma , it rapidly ionizes through charge states seldom seen in this environment . </S>",
    "<S> the aia data show four stages of oxygen ionization ( o iii - o vi ) along with c iv , while xrt likely captured emission from o vii , a line typical of the corona . with a nucleus of at least several hundred meters upon approach to a perihelion that brought the comet to within 0.2 rtextsubscript@xmath0 of the photosphere , </S>",
    "<S> lovejoy was the most significant sungrazer in recent history . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly high outgassing rates on the order of 10textsuperscript32.5 oxygen atoms per second are estimated . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the neutral oxygen comes from water , this translates to a mass - loss rate of @xmath19.5@xmath2 g stextsuperscript-1 , and based only on the 171  observations , we find a total mass loss of @xmath110textsuperscript13 g over the aia egress . </S>",
    "<S> additional and supporting analyses include a differential emission measure to characterize the coronal environment , consideration for the opening angle , and a comparison of the emission s leading edge with the expected position of the nucleus . </S>"
