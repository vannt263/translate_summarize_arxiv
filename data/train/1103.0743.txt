    "it has long been known that the spectral energy distributions of bright early - type galaxies have a pronounced upturn at wavelengths shortward of 2100 ( code & welch 1979 ; brown et al .",
    "1997 ; oconnell et al . 1992 ; oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "this far - uv excess was unexpected as early - type galaxies were believed to contain only old and cold stellar populations . from the shape of the spectral energy distribution in the uv",
    ", it appears that the temperature of the stars which give rise to the excess has a narrow range around 20,000@xmath13000k ( brown et al .",
    "1997 ) which rules out upper main sequence stars as an origin .",
    "it is believed to be caused instead by hot subdwarfs , also known as extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars ( see yi 2008 for a review ) .",
    "a feature of the uv upturn is that it is strongest in the centres of bright elliptical galaxies ( oconnell et al . 1992 ; 1999 ) .",
    "the positive uv colour gradients have been interpreted as abundance gradients , but it is still unclear which abundance or abundances drive these gradients .",
    "such stars are found in globular clusters , and are generally considered to be helium - core burning stars with extremely thin hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are a number of competing models for their origin .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 , 2007 ) and han ( 2008 ) , propose a binary model , in which a star loses all of its envelope near the tip of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) by mass transfer to a companion star or ejection in a common - envelope phase , or where two helium white dwarfs merge with a combined mass larger than @xmath3 . in each case , the remnant star ignites helium and becomes a hot subdwarf .    a number of single - star mechanisms",
    "have been proposed to explain the ehb populations of ellipticals .",
    "park & lee ( 1997 ) find that @xmath420% of the populations are extremely old and metal - poor .",
    "this appears to contradict the observed positive correlation between fuv excess and @xmath5 line strength ( burstein et al . 1988 ) .",
    "most attempts to explain the fuv excess , using single stars , are based upon the idea of greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) that extremely low - mass metal - rich hb stars might skip the agb phase altogether ( `` agb - manqe stars '' ) and move directly to the ehb .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) spectra found that the spectral energy distributions of the uv excess in the cores of bright ellipticals required both enhanced metallicity and enhanced helium with respect to solar abundances .",
    "dorman et al . ( 1995 ) present a range of spectral synthesis models of old stellar populations in which the uv depends largely on the distribution of envelope mass on the zero age horizontal branch .",
    "yi et al . (",
    "1997 ) present stellar population models with supersolar metallicity and helium abundance , and a high , although ad - hoc , value of the reimers ( 1975 ) mass - loss parameter on the rgb ( @xmath6 ) and show that they can reproduce the uv colours of ellipticals .",
    "observations of a uv - bright globular cluster population in m87 ( sohn et al .",
    "2006 , kaviraj et al .",
    "2007 ) again suggest a helium enhancement .",
    "chuzhoy & loeb ( 2004 ) , peng & nagai ( 2009 ) and others propose further that sedimentation of helium during the formation of clusters and galaxies could lead to enhanced helium in brightest cluster galaxies , which do indeed seem to show the strongest excess ( ree et al 2007 ) . on the other hand brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) present a uv colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for m32 , and note that it is incompatible with their evolutionary tracks for supersolar helium abundance .",
    "however evolutionary tracks on and beyond the rgb depend upon a number of parameters , but most of all upon @xmath7 , whose value , and whose dependence upon other parameters of the population , are poorly understood ( percival & salaris 2011 ) .",
    "moreover we are hampered by the fact that m32 , the one elliptical in which the uv bright stars can be resolved , has a very weak uv upturn when compared with giant ellipticals , and it is unclear that conclusions drawn from its cmd can then be applied to more luminous galaxies .",
    "evidence that the fuv excess is a phenomenon of the old stellar population is provided by deep hst / stis ultraviolet observations of ellipticals in the z=0.55 cluster cl0016 + 16 ( brown et al .",
    "2000a ) , and the z=0.33 cluster zwcl1358.1 + 6245 ( brown et al . 2003 ) , which show that the excess is far weaker at these redshifts .",
    "the lookback times to these clusters , 3.7 and 5.4 gyr respectively , suggest that the strengthening of the fuv occurs in populations older than 10 gyr .",
    "however efforts to use the strength of the excess as an age indicator are complicated by our paucity of observational evidence and lack of theoretical understanding of the dependence of the phenomenon on other parameters of the stellar population ( brown et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "post agb stars ( central stars of planetary nebulae ) have also been proposed as a possible origin of the fuv excess , but these are too hot to reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution , and in addition observations of m32 do not find them in sufficient numbers ( brown et al .",
    "2000b , 2008 ) .",
    "metal - poor , agb - manque and binary star models make different predictions for the dependence of the fuv excess upon stellar population age , metallicity and @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "the single - star models , predict different dependences of the fuv excess on galaxy mass , metal abundance and population age ( yi et al .",
    "1999 ) whereas in the binary model the excess does not depend strongly on any of these ( han et al .",
    "2007 ; lisker & han 2008 ) .",
    "specifically , in the binary model , all old galaxies should show a uv excess at some level .",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ; martin et al . 2005 ) has revolutionised the study of the global uv upturn in galaxies and their associated star clusters . in galaxies",
    "it makes a systematic study of the spatial distribution of the fuv excess stars possible .",
    "the fuv excess has long been known to be more centrally concentrated in ellipticals that the underlying old , red , population ( oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "gil de paz et al . ( 2007 ) present `` the galex ultraviolet atlas of galaxies '' , including surface brightness and colour profiles in the galex far ultraviolet ( fuv ) and near ultraviolet ( nuv ) passbands for a sample of 1034 nearby galaxies .",
    "their ( fuv - nuv ) colour gradients of bright early - type galaxies confirm the strong negative colour gradients found in earlier data .",
    "they also find that elliptical and lenticular galaxies with brighter k - band absolute magnitudes show bluer ( fuv - nuv ) colours than fainter ones .",
    "and they find that ( fuv - k ) is an excellent discriminant of morphological type .",
    "donas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , using the same data , investigate colour - colour relations , and the relation between ( fuv - nuv ) and ( b - v ) colours and the @xmath5 line index .",
    "they find a strong negative correlation between the colours ( galaxies which are red in b - v are blue in fuv - nuv ) , and a negative correlation with the line index ( galaxies with strong @xmath5 are bluer in ( fuv - nuv ) . replacing @xmath5 with the velocity dispersion , @xmath8 , gives a very similar result , which is not surprising given the well known correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "loubser & snchez - blzquez ( 2011 ) analyse the global ( fuv - nuv ) colours of a sample of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) and of a control sample of normal ellipticals , from the galex database .",
    "they examine the differences between bcgs and normal ellipticals , and the dependence of the strength of the global fuv excess upon stellar population parameters .",
    "they find that bgcs have stronger uv upturns than normal ellipticals , and with less scatter between them .",
    "surprisingly they find no significant dependence of the strength of the fuv excess upon any stellar population parameter in the bcg sample .",
    "marino et al . ( 2011 ) undertake surface photometry of a sample of gas - rich early type galaxies from galex images .",
    "they confirm the relation between ( fuv - nuv ) colour and the central velocity dispersion .",
    "furthermore they investigate the relationship between the srsic index @xmath9 , derived in both uv and optical bands , and the stellar population parameters , and find that galaxies with @xmath10 tend to have [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath11 0.15 , and hence comparatively short star formation timescales .",
    "jeong et al . ( 2009 ) present galex surface photometry of a sample of galaxies which are also part of the sauron survey .",
    "their prime interest was in identifying early - type galaxies with residual star formation , however they do note that their galaxies have predominantly positive ( fuv - nuv ) colour gradients , and that some of their sample have bluer ( fuv - nuv ) at small radii than the global values for classic fuv excess galaxies .",

    "( 2005 ) suggest that a large enhancement in the helium abundance ( @xmath20 ) can explain the extended blue horizontal branch in part of the stellar population of the globular cluster @xmath21 centauri .",
    "sohn et al . ( 2006 ) investigate the uv properties of the globular clusters associated with ngc4486 .",
    "many of these clusters are very blue in ( fuv - v ) , but in contrast with elliptical galaxies the bluest uv colours are found for the clusters with the weakest @xmath5 index .",
    "kaviraj et al .",
    "( 2007 ) propose that this indicates that these clusters have a small fraction of a helium enhanced population .",
    "globular clusters are of course metal - poor populations compared with massive elliptical galaxies , but these observations strongly suggest that large variations in helium content can be generated by some process or processes .",
    "suggestions include self - enrichment by winds from the first generation of massive agb stars ( dantona & ventura 2007 ) or by winds from massive rapidly rotating stars ( decressin et al .",
    "however whether the helium is primordial of the product of early self - enrichment , we need a mechanism to generate the strong gradients in the fuv excess that we observe .",
    "a number of authors , including chuzhoy & loeb ( 2004 ) and peng & nagai ( 2009 ) , propose that helium sedimentation in cooling gas can generate enhanced helium abundances in brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "the efficiency of this process is a strong function of the temperature of the cooling gas ( diffusion velocity @xmath22 t@xmath23 , and it is supressed by turbulence and by small scale magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless both of these studies conclude that sedimentation can lead to an enhancement of helium by a factor up to 1.2 in cd type galaxies , where the gas temperature is @xmath24 10@xmath25k . at first sight",
    "this sedimentation process is an attractive candidate for the origin of the central gradients in the fuv excess , however there are two problems with this hypothesis , the first is that it is supressed at high gas concentrations , as the pressure gradient causes outward diffusion which supresses sedimentation .",
    "thus the helium abundance enhancement peaks at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the radius within which the mean enclosed mass density is 500 times the critical density of the universe ( peng & nagai 2009 ) .",
    "a further problem is the sedimentation timescale , which is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the local gas fraction ; t is temperature ; and @xmath30 is a suppression factor due to the magnetic field ( chuzhoy & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath31 is likely to be a few gyrs , and so it is difficult to set up a strong gradient in the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "whatever the origin of the enhancement , the persistence of the gradients to the current epoch suggests that this population has not been disturbed by `` dry '' mergers , which would tend to smooth out the gradient .",
    "simulations of the effect of mergers on the persistence of metallicity gradients have been carried out by kobayashi ( 2004 ) and di matteo et al .",
    "the effect of mergers on a helium gradient is a somewhat simpler case , as there is no clear mechanism for regenerating such a gradient if it is disturbed . di matteo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) consider dry mergers of galaxies of equal mass galaxies with a range of initial metallicity slopes .",
    "although they find that a gradient can be preserved or even enhanced through a merger , this is only true when they consider a `` primary '' galaxy merging with a `` companion '' of much steeper slope . in the realistic case of a merger between two galaxies of equal initial slope , they find the remnant to have 0.6 times this initial slope .",
    "repeated major mergers would thus very quickly wash out the initial gradients . if the uv colour gradients are driven by helium abundance , the absence of a regeneration mechanism means that they provide a stronger constraint on the importance of dry mergers in the formation of ellipticals than do the metallicity gradients .",
    "the weak agn and liners shows very little difference in their uv properties from the main sample , particularly once the central 3 arcsec aperture is taken out .",
    "it appears that a weak agn has little effect on the global uv properties .",
    "the s0/sa0/sab0 galaxies differ from the main sample in their nuv properties , in particular in @xmath16 , which is strongly positive in many of this sample .",
    "however the fuv properties of this sample follow largely the same correlations as the main sample , and it seems that the fuv excess is unrelated to any ongoing star formation activity .",
    "in agreement with previous authors we find that early - type galaxies show an excess of flux in the galex far ultraviolet band , compared with that expected from a normal old stellar population .",
    "there is a considerable variation in the magnitude of this excess , and a complex set of dependencies upon the dynamical and stellar population parameters of the galaxy .",
    "the excess shows a stronger correlation with the central velocity dispersion than with the absolute magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "it also shows a definite correlation with [ @xmath0/fe ] in the old stellar population , and a weaker correlation with [ z / h ] .",
    "the fuv excess is more centrally concentrated than the underlying old stellar population in all galaxies except for currently starforming systems and recent major merger remnants .",
    "the logarithmic ( fuv - nuv ) colour gradient @xmath15 is overwhelmingly positive , is typically 0.6 magnitudes / dex , and shows a weak positive correlation with the central internal velocity dispersion @xmath32 , but it correlates much more weakly with the strength of the fuv excess itself . it does not correlate significantly with any stellar population parameter .",
    "most galaxies show a negative colour gradient in ( nuv - j ) , which can be attributed to a metallicity gradient .",
    "this gradient is strongest in galaxies with @xmath33 although we do not sample galaxies with @xmath34 .",
    "the relationship between the srsic index @xmath9 , and [ @xmath0/fe ] in the stellar population found by marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) appears to be driven largely by the nuv band , and appears to be related to the strong uv to ir colour gradients in galaxies with low @xmath32 , and the correlation between @xmath32 and [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "when we treat the fuv excess as a separate component , we find that it is well fit with a srsic model profile with the srsic index @xmath9 in the range 0 to 3.5",
    ". this component can contribute up to 60% of the total fuv flux from the galaxy .",
    "the most likely origin of the fuv excess is in a population of old , probably metal poor , stars which coexist with the optically dominant old metal - rich population in the centres of ellipticals .",
    "helium abundance is a plausible candidate for the property of the stellar population which drives both the variation in the strength of the excess , and the comparatively uniform radial gradients in that strength .",
    "helium sedimentation in a cooling plasma in the very early stages of galaxy formation is a possible mechanism to establish such a gradient , although the timescale required to set up such a gradient by this process may be unfeasibly long .",
    "the persistence of strong gradients to the present day provides strong limits of the importance of major `` dry '' mergers in the formation of ellipticals .",
