    "for the last two decades we have seen that information processing with quantum systems gives us a huge advantage from its classical counterparts .",
    "quantum entanglement @xcite which lies at the heart of quantum information theory is one of the key reason for such technological leap .",
    "it plays a significant role in computational and communicational processes like quantum key generation @xcite , secret sharing @xcite , teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , entanglement swapping@xcite , remote entanglement distribution @xcite , broadcasting @xcite and in many more tasks @xcite . in one hand quantum information theory allows us to do so many things that can not be done with classical information processing systems while at the same time it also forbids us from doing several operations which are otherwise possible with classical systems .",
    "one such fundamental impossibility in this context is the inability to clone quantum states @xcite .",
    "this can be put in form of a theorem called  no cloning theorem \" which states that there does not exist any unitary operation that will take two distinct non - orthogonal quantum states ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) into states @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively .",
    "even though we can not copy an unknown quantum state perfectly but quantum mechanics never rules out the possibility of cloning the state at least in an approximate manner @xcite .",
    "probabilistic cloning is also another possibility where one can always clone an arbitrary quantum state perfectly with some non vanishing probability of success @xcite .",
    "+ the term broadcasting can be used in different perspectives like broadcasting of states , broadcasting of entanglement and more recently in broadcasting of quantum correlation .",
    "barnum et al .",
    "were the first to talk about the broadcasting of states where they showed that non - commuting mixed states do not meet the criteria of broadcasting @xcite .",
    "many authors showed by using sophisticated methods that correlations in a single bipartite state can be locally broadcast if and only if the states are classical in nature ( i.e. having classical correlation ) @xcite .",
    "when we refer broadcasting of an entangled state , we mean creating more pairs of less entangled state from a given entangled state .",
    "one way of doing this is by applying local cloning transformations on each qubit of the given entangled state @xcite .",
    "this can also be done by applying global cloning operations on the entangled state itself @xcite.in their paper buzek et al .",
    "showed that indeed the decompression of initial quantum entanglement is possible by doing local cloning operation @xcite .",
    "further , in a separate work bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite showed that universal quantum cloners with fidelity is greater than @xmath6 are only suitable as the non - local output states becomes inseparable for some values of the input parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to this they proved that an entanglement is optimally broadcast only when optimal quantum cloners are used .",
    "they also showed that broadcasting of entanglement into more than two entangled pairs is not possible using only local operations .",
    "ghiu investigated the broadcasting of entanglement by using local @xmath8 optimal universal asymmetric pauli machines and showed that the inseparability is optimally broadcast when symmetric cloners are applied @xcite .",
    "in other works , authors investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of three - qubit entangled state between two distant partners with universal quantum cloning machine and then the result is generalized to generate secret entanglement among three parties @xcite .",
    "various other works on broadcasting of entanglement depending on the types of qcms were also done in the later period @xcite . in another recent work we studied whether we can broadcast quantum correlation that goes beyond entanglement . in a recent work authors",
    "have investigated the problem of broadcasting of quantum correlation @xcite that goes beyond the notion for general two qubit states @xcite .",
    "+ the problem of complementarity or mutually exclusiveness of quantum phenomenons was from the beginning of quantum mechanics . following the discovery of heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite it was bohr who came up with the concept of complementarity in the following year @xcite .",
    "even in quantum information theory mutually exclusive aspects of physical phenomenon is not something new as there had been previous instances depicting the complementarity between the local and non local information of the quantum systems @xcite and between the correlation generated in dual physical processes like cloning and deletion @xcite .",
    "we do broadcasting when we require more number of entangled states in a network instead of a highly entangled state .",
    "this is mostly required when we require to do distributed information processing tasks .",
    "it is natural to expect in a bipartite situation that these newly born entangled states are less suitable in tasks like teleportation and super dense coding than the parent state .",
    "however it is not well known how their capability are controlled by our ability of broadcasting . in this work",
    "we find out several complimentary relations manifesting the interdependence of their information processing capabilities and fidelity of broadcasting .",
    "we extend our investigation in a situation where instead of using @xmath1 cloning , we have used @xmath0 cloning transformations both locally and non locally .",
    "eventually we find out the fidelity of broadcasting and the change in the information processing capacities for different values of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and investigate how these complimentary relations behave with the increase in number of copies ( @xmath9 ) . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the standard procedure of broadcasting of quantum entanglement with the aid of both local and non local cloning machine . in section 3",
    "we present the complimentary relationship between the fidelity of broadcasting and the capability of information processing tasks like teleportation and super dense coding .",
    "first of all we provide numerical results in form of various plots for general two qubit mixed states .",
    "then we have considered particular examples like werner like states and bell diagonal state and show the complimentary phenomenon in each of these examples .",
    "in section 4 we separately study complimentary phenomenon with increased number of obtained copies by applying general optimal @xmath0 cloning transformation instead of @xmath1 cloning transforms .",
    "quantum cloning transformations can be viewed as a completely positive trace preserving map between two quantum systems , supported by an ancilla @xcite . in this section , firstly we revisit the gisin - massar ( g - m ) qcm which we will later use for our complementarity analysis with the entangled output states in the broadcasting process via local cloning @xcite .",
    "more particularly , it is an optimal state - independent qcm which creates @xmath9 identical copies from an input qubit .",
    "when @xmath11 , the g - m cloner reduces to the buzek - hillery ( b - h ) local state - independent optimal cloner @xcite .",
    "secondly , we extend the idea of g - m cloner to a state independent two dimensional nonlocal cloner like the b - h qcm in higher dimensions which copies a general two qubit input state into @xmath9 identical copies with an optimal fidelity @xcite . + * local state - independent @xmath12 cloning @xcite : *",

    "in this section , we briefly discuss the principle of broadcasting of quantum entanglement ( inseparability ) with the help of both local and nonlocal cloning operations .",

    "+ in order to test the range for separability as well as inseparability of the output states , we use the peres - horodecki criteria @xcite .",
    "this is a necessary and sufficient criteria for detecting entanglement in bipartite systems with dimension @xmath67 and @xmath68 .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the principle of broadcasting of quantum entanglement by using local cloning transformation . for this",
    "we start with a two qubit state @xmath48 ( given in eq .  )",
    "shared between two parties @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the first qubit ` 1 ' belongs to the party @xmath49 while the second qubit ` 2 ' belongs to @xmath50 .",
    "each of them will now individually apply the local copying transformation ( given by eq .  ) , on their own qubit to produce the state @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for all local cloning operations we consider @xmath11 , that is the b - h optimal local cloner , since in this operational technique for higher values of @xmath9 the output nonlocal pairs always remain disentangled @xcite .",
    "more formally , it can be defined as follows : + * definition 2.1 @xcite : * [ def : broad_local ] an entangled state @xmath48 is said to be broadcast after the application of local cloning operation @xmath69 , each of the type given by eq .",

    "\\label{eq : gen_local_output_localcloner}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the state @xmath48 given in eq .   is a general mixed state and will not be entangled for all values of its parameters .",
    "however , when we talk about broadcasting of entanglement it is only relevant to consider those values when the initial state @xmath48 is entangled .",
    "then the range of input state parameters for which broadcasting will be possible is always going to be a subset of the range of the input state parameters for which @xmath48 is entangled .",
    "+      in this subsection , we reconsider the problem of broadcasting of entanglement , however this time we use nonlocal cloning transformation to create more pairs .",
    "this situation is quite analogous to the previous case where we have used local cloning operations . here ,",
    "the basic idea is that the starting state is again @xmath48 ( given in eq .  ) and we want to create more entangled copies but with a global unitary operation @xmath74 to produce @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "importantly , here @xmath9 can be greater than @xmath71 unlike the previous case of local cloning , since for @xmath75 the output pairs have some residual entanglement @xcite .",
    "more particularly we can define it as follows :    * definition 2.2 @xcite : * an entangled state @xmath48 is said to be broadcast after the application of nonlocal cloning operation @xmath74 ( given by eq .  )",
    "together on the qubits @xmath70 and @xmath71 , if for some values of the input state parameters ,    * the desired output states + @xmath76 = @xmath77 $ ] , + @xmath78 = @xmath79 $ ] are inseparable , * and the remaining output states + @xmath63 = @xmath80 $ ] , + @xmath64 = @xmath81 $ ] are separable .",
    "we could have also chosen the diagonal pairs ( @xmath82 ) instead of choosing the pairs : @xmath83 as our desired pairs in the above definition . however , we refrain ourselves from choosing the pairs @xmath84 as the desired pairs @xcite . +",
    "in this section , we present the central idea of our work where we establish the complimentary relations between the fidelity of broadcasting process with the decremental change in the information processing abilities as a consequence of generation of lesser entangled pairs from an initially more entangled resource . as explained in the previous section , this entire process of broadcasting can happen by the use of either local or nonlocal cloning operations . in our complementarity analysis , we consider two of the most common quantum information processing protocols , namely teleportation and superdense coding @xcite .",
    "however , we conjecture that this complementary nature between broadcasting fidelity and information processing ability of an input entangled state will hold true for all known information processing protocols in the quantum world . after applying either of the cloning process",
    ", we separately calculate the change in the maximal teleportation fidelity and the superdense coding capacity of the entangled state to find that these values can not be arbitrary values @xcite .",
    "this change has a trade off with the broadcasting fidelity of the process .",
    "in fact the sum of these two quantities is a constant expression .",
    "interestingly this shows us that each of these quantities are complimentary in nature . in other words ,",
    "better is the fidelity of broadcasting lesser is the change in the information processing capabilities . in short ,",
    "if we broadcast well we preserve the capacity of the entangled state to be used as an useful resource .",
    "next , we briefly define + * teleportation fidelity : * + quantum teleportation is sending the quantum information belonging to one party to a distant party with the help of a resource entangled state @xcite .",
    "it is well known that all pure entangled states @xmath67 dimensions are useful for teleportation @xcite . however , the situation is not so trivial for mixed entangled states .",
    "there are also entangled states which can not be used as a resource for teleportation @xcite .",
    "however after suitable local operation and classical communication ( locc ) one can always convert them to states which become useful for teleportation @xcite .",
    "the extent to which a two qubit state can be used as a resource for teleportation is quantified by the maximal fidelity of teleportation ( @xmath85 ) @xcite . for a general two qubit mixed state ( given by eq .  ) as a resource , we have the @xmath85 defined for it as , @xmath86.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath88 .",
    "a quantum state is said to be useful for teleportation when @xmath85 is more than @xmath89 which is the classically achievable limit of fidelity of teleportation .",
    "one such example of an useful resources is the werner state @xcite in @xmath67 dimensions for a certain range of its classical probabilities of mixing @xcite .",
    "other examples , of mixed entangled states as a resource for teleportation also exists @xcite . + * super dense coding capacity * + quantum super dense coding involves in sending of classical information from one sender to the receiver when they are sharing a quantum resource in form of an entangled state .",
    "more specifically , superdense coding is a technique used in quantum information theory to transmit classical information by sending quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it is quite well known that if we have a maximally entangled state in @xmath90 as our resource , then we can send @xmath91 bits of classical information . in the asymptotic case , we know one can send @xmath92 amount of bit when one considers non - maximally entangled state as resource @xcite .",
    "it had been seen that the number of classical bits one can transmit using a non - maximally entangled state in @xmath90 as a resource is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the smallest schmidt coefficient .",
    "however , when the state is maximally entangled in its subspace then one can send up to @xmath95 bits @xcite .",
    "+      in this subsection , we consider the most generalized two qubit mixed state @xmath48 as our initial resource given by eq .",
    ". then we apply generalized buzek hillery cloning transformation on this state to obtain four qubit states @xmath62 as output .",
    "the cloning is carried out both locally on individual qubits and nonlocally on both the qubits . then in each case we trace out the redundant qubits to obtain the newly generated entangled pairs @xmath96 ( for local cloning ) and @xmath97 ( for nonlocal cloning ) .",
    "for each of them , we compute the broadcasting fidelity which is given by ,        in the transition of the initial state @xmath48 to the final state @xmath101 through the decompression process .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the sum of both these quantities with the corresponding broadcasting fidelities is always bounded by a quantity depending on the initial state parameters .",
    "we plot these sums in subsequent figures for both local and nonlocal cloning transformations . in other words",
    "we show that these two quantities namely broadcasting fidelity ( @xmath102 ) and the change in these information processing capabilities ( @xmath103 ) are complimentary to each other .",
