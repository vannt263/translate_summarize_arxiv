    "the recently released wmap @xcite results constrain our cosmology with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "most of these constraints come from the linear fossils of the early universe which have been preserved in the temperature anisotropies of the cmb .",
    "these are the ones that can be easily understood and dealt with , within the framework of linear perturbation theory . however , there are also imprints of the late universe which could be seen in the wmap results .",
    "most notably , the measurement of the optical depth to the surface of last scattering , @xmath3 , which implied an early reionization of the universe , was the biggest surprise .",
    "there is also the strangely small amplitude of the large - angle cmb anisotropies which remains unexplained@xcite .",
    "can we extract more about the late universe from wmap ?",
    "various secondary effects have been studied in the literature ( see @xcite which lists a few ) .",
    "the main secondary anisotropy at large angles is the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect@xcite , which is a signature of the decay of the gravitational potential at large scales .",
    "this could be either a result of spatial curvature , or presence of a component with negative pressure , the so - called dark energy , in the universe@xcite .",
    "since wmap has constrained the deviation from flatness to less than 4% , the isw effect may be interpreted as a signature of dark energy . at smaller angles ,",
    "the dominant source of secondary anisotropy is the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect@xcite , which is due to scattering of cmb photons by hot gas in the universe .",
    "however , none of these effects can make a significant contribution to the cmb power spectrum below @xmath4 , and thus they are undetectable by wmap alone .",
    "one possible avenue is cross - correlating cmb anisotropies with a tracer of the density in the late universe@xcite .",
    "this was first done by @xcite who cross - correlated the cobe / dmr map@xcite with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss)@xcite .",
    "after the release of wmap , different groups cross - correlated the wmap temperature maps with various tracers of the low - redshift universe .",
    "this was first done with the rosat x - ray map in @xcite , where a non - detection of the thermal sz effect puts a constraint on the hot gas content of the universe .",
    "@xcite claimed a 2 - 5@xmath5 detection of an sz signal by filtering wmap maps via templates made using known x - ray cluster catalogs .",
    "@xcite looked at the cross - correlation with the nvss radio galaxy survey , while @xcite repeated the exercise for nvss , as well as the heao-1 hard x - ray background survey , both of which trace the universe around redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "both groups found their result to be consistent with the expected isw signal for the wmap concordance cosmology @xcite , i.e. a flat @xmath7cdm universe with @xmath8 , at the @xmath9 level .",
    "their result is consistent with the paradigm which puts most of the energy of the universe in dark energy@xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite cross - correlated wmap with the apm galaxy survey@xcite which traces the galaxy distribution at @xmath10 .",
    "this led to an apparent detection of both the thermal sz and isw signals .",
    "however , the fact that they use a jack - knife covariance matrix to estimate the strength of their signal , while their jack - knife errors are significantly smaller than those obtained by monte - carlo realizations of the cmb sky ( compare their figure 2 and figure 3 ) weakens the significance of their claim . indeed , as we argue below ( see iii.c ) , using monte - carlo realizations of the cmb sky",
    "is the only reliable way to estimate a covariance matrix if the survey does not cover the whole sky .",
    "@xcite cross - correlates the highest frequency band ( w - band ) of the wmap with the aco cluster survey@xcite , as well as the galaxy groups and clusters in the apm galaxy survey .",
    "they claim a @xmath11 detection of temperature decrement on angles less than @xmath12 , which they associate with the thermal sz effect .",
    "however they only consider the poisson noise in their cluster distribution as their source of error .",
    "this underestimates the error due to large spatial correlations ( or cosmic variance ) in the cluster distribution ( see iii.c ) .",
    "@xcite also studies the cross - correlation of the w - band with the nvss radio sources below a degree and claims a positive correlation at the scale of the w - band resolution .",
    "this may imply a possible contamination of the isw signal detection in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however the achromatic nature of this correlation makes this unlikely@xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite repeated the cross - correlation analysis with the 3400 and 2000 square degrees , respectively , of the sloan digital sky survey@xcite .",
    "both groups claim detection of a positive signal , but they both suffer from the inconsistency of their jack - knife and monte - carlo errors .",
    "the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc)@xcite is a full sky , near infrared survey of galaxies whose median redshift is around @xmath13 .",
    "the survey has reliable and uniform photometry of about 1 million galaxies , and is complete , at the 90% level for k - magnitudes brighter than 14 , over @xmath14 of the sky .",
    "the large area coverage and number of galaxies makes the 2mass xsc a good tracer of the isw and sz signals in the cross - correlation with the cmb .    in this paper , we study the cross - correlation of the wmap q , v and w bands with four different k - magnitude bins of the 2mass extended source catalog , and fit it with a three component model which includes the isw , thermal sz effects and microwave sources .",
    "we compare our findings with the theoretical expectations from the wmap+cbi+acbar+2df+ly-@xmath15 best fit cosmological model ( wmap concordance model from here on ; see table 3 in @xcite ) , which is a flat universe with , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we also assume their values of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for the spectral index and its running at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the relevant secondary anisotropies of the cmb in sec .",
    "iii describes the properties of the cross - correlation of two random fields , projected on the sky .",
    "iv summarizes the relevant information on the wmap temperature maps and the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "v describes our results and possible systematics , and sec .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "the dominant nature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations , at angles larger than @xmath21 degree , is primordial , which makes cmb a snapshot of the universe at radiation - matter decoupling , around redshift of @xmath22 .",
    "however , a small part of these fluctuations can be generated as the photons travel through the low redshift universe .",
    "these are the so - called secondary anisotropies . in this section",
    ", we go through the three effects which should dominate the wmap/2mass cross - correlation .",
    "the first one is the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect@xcite which is caused by the time variation in the cosmic gravitational potential , @xmath23 . for a flat universe",
    ", the anisotropy due to the isw effect is an integral over the conformal time @xmath24 _ isw ( * * ) & = & 2 ^[(_0- ) * * , ]  d , where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is unit vector in the line of sight .",
    "the linear metric is assumed to be ds^2=a^2()\\{[1 + 2(*x*,)]d^2-[1 - 2(*x*,)]*dx dx * } , and @xmath27 is the conformal time at the present .    in a flat universe ,",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath23 is constant for a fixed equation of state and therefore observation of an isw effect is an indicator of a change in the equation of state of the universe . assuming that this change is due to an extra component in the matter content of the universe , the so - called dark energy , this component should have a negative pressure to become important at late times@xcite",
    "therefore , observation of an isw effect in a flat universe is a signature of dark energy .",
    "the isw effect is observed at large angular scales because most of the power in the fluctuations of @xmath23 is at large scales .",
    "additionally , the fluctuations at small angles tend to cancel out due to the integration over the line of sight .",
    "the other significant source of secondary anisotropies is the so - called thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , which is caused by the scattering of cmb photons off the hot electrons of the intra - cluster medium .",
    "this secondary anisotropy is frequency dependent , i.e. it can not be associated with a single change in temperature .",
    "if we define a frequency dependent @xmath28 so that @xmath29 = i(\\nu)$ ] , where @xmath30 is the cmb intensity and @xmath31 $ ] is the black - body spectrum at temperature @xmath32 , the sz anisotropy takes the form & = & - p_e[(_0- ) * * , ] a ( )  d , where xh/(k_b t _ )  and   f(x ) 4 - x(x/2 ) , and @xmath33 is the electron pressure . assuming a linear pressure bias with respect to the matter overdensity @xmath34 : & = & b_p _ m , eq.(3 ) can be written as _ sz ( ) = - f(x)_e _ m , where & _ e = b_p |t_e , & + & f(x)= = ( 1.16 10 ^ -4 ^-1 ) _ b h f(x ) , & and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the average temperature and the comoving density of ( all ) electrons , respectively . in appendix",
    "a , we make an analytic estimate for @xmath37 , based on the mass function and mass - temperature relation of galaxy clusters .",
    "although technically they are not secondary anisotropies , microwave sources may contribute to the cross - correlation signal , as they are potentially observable by both wmap and 2mass .",
    "for simplicity , we associate an average microwave luminosity with all 2mass sources",
    ". we can relax this assumption by taking this luminosity to be a free parameter for each magnitude bin , and/or removing the clustering of the point sources . as we discuss in sec .",
    "v.c , neither of these change our results significantly .    for the microwave spectrum in different wmap frequencies , we try both a steeply falling antenna temperature @xmath38 ( consistent with wmap point sources@xcite ) and a milky way type spectrum which we obtain from the wmap observations of the galactic foreground @xcite .    in appendix b",
    ", assuming an exponential surface emissivity with a scale length of @xmath39 for the galactic disk and a small disk thickness , we use the galactic latitude dependence of the wmap temperature to determine the luminosity of the milky way ( eq.b6 ) in different wmap bands : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42    these values are within 50% of the observed wmap luminosity of the andromeda galaxy(see appendix b ) . in v.c",
    ", we compare the observed average luminosity of the 2mass sources to these numbers ( see table ii ) .",
    "the contribution to the cmb anisotropy due to point sources ( see eq.b2 ) is given by _",
    "ps ( * * ) = = dr ( ) ^2 n_c(r ) _ g(r , * * ) , where @xmath43 is the effective bandwidth of the wmap band@xcite , @xmath44 is the average comoving number density of the survey galaxies , @xmath45 is luminosity distance , and @xmath46 is the galaxy overdensity .",
    "we first develop the theoretical expectation value of the cross - correlation of two random fields , projected on the sky .",
    "let us consider two random fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 with their fourier transforms defined as a_*k * =   e^-i*k.x * a(*x * ) ,   and  b_*k * =   e^-i*k.x * b(*x * ) . the cross - correlation power spectrum ,",
    "@xmath49 is defined by a_*k_1 * b_*k_2*&= & ( 2)^3 * ^3(k_1-k_2 ) * p_ab(k_1 ) .",
    "the projections of @xmath50 and @xmath51 on the sky are defined using @xmath52 and @xmath53 projection kernels ( * * ) = dr  f_a(r ) a(r * * ) ,  and   ( * * ) = dr  f_b(r ) b(r * * ) .    for the secondary temperature anisotropies ,",
    "these kernels were given in eqs.1,6 and 8 .",
    "for the projected galaxy overdensity , this kernel is f_g(r ) = . for our treatment , we assume a constant galaxy bias , @xmath54 , which relates the galaxy fluctuations , @xmath46 , to the overall matter density fluctuations @xmath34 , up to a shot noise @xmath55 _",
    "g = b_g _ m + _ p . in this work ,",
    "we constrain the galaxy bias , @xmath54 , by comparing the auto - correlation of the galaxies with the expected matter auto - correlation in our cosmological model . our bias , therefore , is model dependent .",
    "now , expanding @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of spherical harmonics , the cross - power spectrum , @xmath58 is defined as & c_ab()_m^*_m & + & = dr_1 dr_2 f_a(r_1 ) f_b(r_2 ) & + & p_ab(k ) ( 4)^2 j_(kr_1)j_(kr_2 ) y_m(**)y^*_m ( * * ) & + & = dr_1 dr_2 f_a(r_1 ) f_b(r_2 ) j_(kr_1)j_(kr_2 ) p_ab(k ) , & +   where @xmath59 s are the spherical bessel functions of rank @xmath60 and @xmath61 s are the spherical harmonics .    to proceed further , we use the small angle ( large @xmath60 ) approximation for the spherical bessel functions j_(x)= [ _ dirac(+-x)+ o(^-2 ) ] , which yields c_ab()= f_a(r)f_b(r ) p_ab ( ) .",
    "this is the so called limber equation @xcite . as we do not use the quadrupole due to its large galactic contamination ,",
    "the smallest value of @xmath60 that we use is 3 .",
    "direct integration of eq.(15 ) ( for the isw signal which is dominant for low @xmath60 s , see figure 7 ) shows that the limber equation overestimates the cross - power by less than 2 - 3% at @xmath62 , which is negligible compared to the minimum cosmic variance error ( about @xmath63 , see iii.b ) at this multipole .",
    "therefore , the limber equation is an accurate estimator of the theoretical power spectrum .",
    "now we can substitute the results of sec .",
    "ii ( eqs.1 , 6 , 8 and 12 ) into eq.(16 ) which yields c_gt(x,)= dr   n_c(r)\\{2 p_^,m ( ) + -p ( ) } , where @xmath64 is the matter power spectrum , @xmath65 is the redshift , and @xmath66 is defined in eq.(4 ) .",
    "the terms in eq.(17 ) are the isw , sz and point source contributions respectively .",
    "since the isw effect is only important at large scales , the cross - power of the gravitational potential derivative with matter fluctuations can be expressed in terms of the matter power spectrum , using the poisson equation and linear perturbation theory , and thus we end up with c_gt(x,)= dr   n_c(r)\\{-3h^2_0 _ m ( 1+z ) + -f(x)_e ( 1+z)^2 + } p ( ) , where @xmath67 is the linear growth factor of the gravitational potential,@xmath23 , and @xmath68 is its derivative with respect to the conformal time .",
    "we will fit this model to our data in sec .",
    "v , allowing a free normalization for each term .",
    "finally , we write the theoretical expectation for the projected galaxy auto - power,@xmath69 , which we use to find the galaxy bias . combining eqs.12,13 and 16 , we arrive at c_gg ( ) = , where the @xmath70 term is the power spectrum of the poisson noise , @xmath55 , while the extra free parameter , @xmath71 , is introduced to include the possible corrections to the poisson noise due to the finite pixel size . in the absence of such corrections @xmath72 . in sec .",
    "v , we seek the values of @xmath54 and @xmath71 that best fit our observed auto - power for each galaxy sub - sample .    to include the effects of non - linearities in the galaxy power spectrum , we use the peacock & dodds fitting formula @xcite for the non - linear matter power spectrum , @xmath64 .",
    "to estimate the expected theoretical error , again for simplicity , we restrict the calculation to the small angle limit . in this limit",
    ", the cross - correlation function can be approximated by c_ab ( ) & & _ m  ^*_m , where @xmath73 is the common solid angle of the patch of the sky covered by observations of both @xmath56 and @xmath57@xcite .",
    "assuming gaussianity , the standard deviation in @xmath74 , for a single harmonic mode , is given by c^2_ab ( ) & = & c^2_ab()-c_ab()^2 + & = & ^-2[_m  ^*_m _ m  ^*_m + _ m  ^*_m _ m  ^*_m ] + & = & c^2_ab ( ) + c_aa()c_bb ( ) . the number of modes available between @xmath60 and @xmath75 , in the patch @xmath73 , is n , and so the standard deviation of @xmath74 , averaged over all these modes is c^2_ab ( ) [ c^2_ab()+c_aa()c_bb ( ) ] .",
    "in fact , since the main part of cmb fluctuations is of primordial origin , the first term in brackets is negligible for the cross - correlation error , so the error in the cross - correlation function , as one may expect , depends on the individual auto - correlations .",
    "we can use the cmbfast code @xcite to calculate the auto - correlation of the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "also , the theoretical expectation for the auto - power of the projected galaxy distribution is given by eq.(19 ) .",
    "the galaxy / cmb auto - power spectra are dominated by poisson(shot ) noise / detector noise at large @xmath60 s .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the thermal sz signal , which becomes important at large @xmath60 s , is limited by the number of observed galaxies , as well as the resolution of the cmb detector ( the angle at which signal - to - noise ratio for the cmb measurement is of order unity ) . on the other hand , for the small @xmath60 portion of the cross - correlation which is relevant for the isw signal , the error is set by the matter and cmb power spectra and thus , is only limited by cosmic variance . the only way to reduce this error is by observing a larger volume of the universe in the redshift range @xmath76 , where dark energy dominates .",
    "we saw in section iii.c that the errors in cross - correlations could be expressed in terms of the theoretical auto - correlation .",
    "however , this is not the whole story .",
    "we have a remarkable understanding of the auto - power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "however , if one tries to use the frequency information to , say subtract out the microwave sources , the simple temperature auto - power does not give the cross - frequency terms in the covariance matrix .",
    "in fact , in the absence of a good model , the only way to constrain these terms is by using the cross - correlation of the bands themselves .",
    "of course , this method is limited by cosmic variance and hence does not give an accurate result at low multipoles . to solve this problem , we use the wmap concordance model cmb auto - power for @xmath77 .",
    "since there is no frequency - dependent signal at low @xmath60 s , we only use the w - band information , which has the lowest galactic contamination @xcite , for our first 4 @xmath60-bins which cover @xmath78 ( see the end of sec .",
    "iii.d for more on our @xmath60-space binning ) .",
    "there is a similar situation for the contaminants of the 2mass galaxy catalog .",
    "systematic errors in galaxy counts , due to stellar contamination or variable galactic extinction , as well as observational calibration errors , may introduce additional anisotropies in the galaxy distribution which are not easy to model .",
    "again , the easiest way to include these systematics in the error is by using the auto - correlation of the observed galaxy distribution , which is inaccurate for low multipoles , due to cosmic variance .",
    "unfortunately , this is also where we expect to see possible galactic contamination or observational systematics . with this in mind",
    ", we try to avoid this problem by excluding the quadrupole , @xmath79 , from our analysis .    at this point",
    ", we should point out a misconception about the nature of monte - carlo vs. jack - knife error estimates in some previous cross - correlation analyses , specifically @xcite .",
    "many authors have used gaussian monte - carlo realizations of the cmb sky to estimate the covariance matrix of their real - space cross - correlation functions@xcite .",
    "the justification for this method is that , since the first term in eq.(23 ) is much smaller than the second term , the error in cross - correlation for any random realization of the maps is almost the same as the true error , and the covariance of the cross - correlation , obtained from many random gaussian realizations is an excellent estimator of the covariance matrix .",
    "we may also obtain error estimates based on random realizations of one of the maps , as long as the observed auto - power is a good approximation of the true auto - power , i.e. the cosmic variance is low , which should be the case for angles smaller than 20 degrees ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "of course , at larger angles , as we mentioned above , one is eventually limited by the systematics of the galaxy survey and , unless they are understood well enough , since theoretical error estimate is not possible , there will be no better alternative rather than monte - carlo error estimates .",
    "in fact , contrary to @xcite , if anything , the presence of cross - correlation makes monte - carlo errors a slight underestimate ( see eq.23 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no rigorous justification for the validity of jack - knife covariance matrices , and the fact that jack - knife errors could be smaller than the monte - carlo errors by up to a factor of three @xcite implies that they underestimate the error .    as we argue below ( see sec .",
    "iii.d ) , since we do our analyses in harmonic space and use most of the sky , our @xmath60-bins are nearly independent and performing monte - carlo s is not necessary .",
    "our covariance matrix is nearly diagonal in @xmath60-space and its elements can be obtained analytically , using eq.(23 ) .",
    "the wmap temperature maps are set in healpix format @xcite , which is an equal area , iso - latitude pixellization of the sky . as a component of the healpix package , the fft based subroutine ` map2alm ' computes the harmonic transform of any function on the whole sky .",
    "however , as we describe in the next section , in order to avoid contamination by galactic foreground emission in wmap temperature maps , and contamination by stars and galactic extinction in the 2mass survey , we have to mask out @xmath81 of the cmb and @xmath82 of the 2mass sky .",
    "therefore , we can not obtain the exact values of the multipoles , @xmath83 , and should use an estimator .",
    "we use a quadratic estimator which is based on the assumption that our masks , @xmath84 , are independent of the data that we try to extract ( see @xcite for a review of different estimators ) .",
    "the real - space cross - correlation of the masked fields @xmath85 and @xmath86 on the sphere is given by & |a(**)|b ( * * ) ( * * ) ( * * ) w_a(**)w_b ( * * ) & + & = ( * * ) ( * * ) w_a(**)w_b ( * * ) , & where , in the last step , we used the independence of data and masks , and averaged over all pairs of the same separation . assuming",
    "that @xmath87 does not vanish for any separation ( which will be true if the masked out area is not very large ) , we can invert this equation and take the legendre transform to obtain the un - masked multipoles c _ ( ) & = & ^_max_=0 f_^ c_|a|b(^ ) ,  where + f_^&=&(^+ )   d.    in fact this estimator is mathematically identical to the one used by the wmap team @xcite , and , within the computational error , should give the same result .",
    "the difference is that we do the inversion in real - space , where it is diagonal , and then transform to harmonic space , while they do the inversion directly in harmonic space . indeed , using our method",
    ", we reproduce the wmap binned multipoles @xcite within 5% . however , we believe our method is computationally more transparent and hence more reliable . also , the matrix inversion in harmonic space is unstable for a small or irregular sky coverage ( although it is not relevant for our analyses ) .    finally , we comment on the correlation among different multipoles in @xmath60-space . masking about",
    "30% of the sky causes about 30% correlation among neighboring multipoles .",
    "we bin our multipoles into 13 bins that are logarithmically spaced in @xmath60 ( covering @xmath88 ) , while excluding the quadrupole due to its large galactic contamination in both data sets .",
    "the highest correlation between neighboring bins is @xmath89 between the first and the second bins ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) . to simplify our calculations",
    ", we neglect this correlation , as any correction to our results will be significantly smaller than the cosmic variance uncertainty(see v.b ) , i.e. we approximate our covariance matrix as diagonal in @xmath60-space .",
    "we use the first year of the observed cmb sky by wmap for our analysis @xcite . the wmap experiment observes the microwave sky in 5 frequency bands ranging from 23 to 94 ghz .",
    "the detector resolution increases monotonically from 0.88 degree for the lowest frequency band to 0.22 degree for the highest frequency . due to their low resolution and large galactic contamination , the two bands with the lowest frequencies , k(23 ghz ) and ka(33 ghz ) ,",
    "are mainly used for galactic foreground subtraction and galactic mask construction@xcite , while the three higher frequency bands , which have the highest resolution and lowest foreground contamination , q(41 ghz ) , v(61 ghz ) , and w(94 ghz ) , are used for cmb anisotropy spectrum analysis . @xcite use the maximum entropy method to combine the frequency dependence of 5 wmap bands with the known distribution of different galactic components that trace the dominant foregrounds to obtain the foreground contamination in each band .",
    "this foreground map is then used to clean the q , v and w bands for the angular power spectrum analysis .",
    "similarly , we use the cleaned temperature maps of these three bands for our cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we also use the same sky mask that they use , the kp2 mask which masks out 15% of the sky , in order to avoid any remaining galactic foreground , as well as 208 identified microwave point sources .",

    "future wide - angle surveys of galaxies should be particularly valuable for cross - correlation with the wmap data , especially as the latter gains signal - to - noise ratio in further data releases .",
    "the pan - starrs project @xcite for example , should yield a multi - color galaxy catalog to 25th mag or even fainter over 20,000 square degrees or more of the sky well before the end of the decade ; it will more directly probe the redshift range in which the sz and isw kernels peak , and therefore should be particularly valuable for cross - correlating with wmap and other cmb experiments .",
