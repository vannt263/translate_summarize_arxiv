    "the idea of entanglement entropy , which originated in the context of explaining entropy of black holes @xcite , has now become an established quantity of interest in quantum information , many - body physics @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this quantity , in its very essence , captures the quantum entanglement of a subset ( @xmath3 ) of the hilbert space ( @xmath4 ) with the rest of it .",
    "entanglement entropy is defined as the von - neumann entropy corresponding to the reduced density matrix @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of a subspace of @xmath7 is , in turn , obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom living in its complement ( @xmath8 ) .    in 1 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "the entanglement entropy corresponding to a subsystem @xmath9 of a single - interval @xmath10 , is known to obey the universal formula : @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this formula relates to ` real - space entanglement ' , in the sense that the hilbert space is geometrically partitioned . in this article",
    ", we consider a special class of excited states for cfts on a circle .",
    "in particular , we consider conformally invariant boundary states , @xmath12 , which are generically linear combinations of ishibashi states , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this class of states appear in the context of d - branes in string theory @xcite , critical quantum quenches @xcite , quantum impurity problems @xcite and the tqft / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "these states are in a basis which is holomorphically factorizable into their left and right moving sectors .",
    "the entanglement entropy associated with such a factorization is termed as _ left - right entanglement entropy _ ( lree ) . the state @xmath12 is , however , non - normalizable . a way to regularize",
    "the norm is to perform a euclidean time evolution by @xmath14 and work with the regularized state @xmath15 instead @xcite .",
    "the left - right entanglement entropy was studied for states of this type for free bosons in @xcite and in xxz chains in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we develop the formalism to calculate lree for the states , @xmath16 , in arbitrary cfts .",
    "we investigate universalities determined by the typical cft data .",
    "we shall see that for all , defined on a circle of circumference @xmath17 , regardless of what boundary conditions are chosen , as @xmath16 approaches the boundary state , the lree always contains a term proportional to the central charge ( @xmath18),@xmath19 also , if we work directly with the ishibashi states , then there is a finite piece which can be written precisely in terms of the _ quantum dimensions _ , @xmath20 , as , @xmath21 where , @xmath22 , is the total quantum dimension .",
    "this expression above reproduces the answer for the spatial entanglement entropy corresponding to a single anyonic excitation of type @xmath23 in a ( 2 + 1)-@xmath0 in topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) which has a chiral cft describing its edge modes . the first term in being the _ area law term _ and the second term the _ topological entanglement entropy _ @xcite .",
    "as we elaborate below , the reason why this happens is because the entanglement / modular hamiltonian of a bulk ( 2 + 1)-@xmath0 theory is equal to the hamiltonian describing a chiral cft on its edge @xcite .",
    "this result , therefore , follows as a consequence of the correspondence relating 2@xmath0 cfts and 3@xmath0 tqfts @xcite .",
    "the ishibashi states @xmath13 , however , do not satisfy modular invariance when the cft is on a finite cylinder .",
    "imposing this constraint gives us a specific linear combination of @xmath13 , which are known as the _ cardy states _",
    ", @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we derive expressions for lree for these states in diagonal cfts in terms of the modular @xmath1-matrix of the cft @xmath25 this formula clearly shows the explicit dependence of this quantity on the choice of @xmath16 which is parametrized here by the index @xmath10 .",
    "for the choice @xmath26 , the finite piece becomes @xmath27 . once again , using the tqft / cft correspondence , we interpret this as the average topological entanglement entropy .",
    "we explicitly evaluate the lree corresponding to the cardy states for a few cases  two minimal models describing statistical systems at criticality ( the ising model and the tricritical ising model ) and the @xmath2 wzw model .",

    "@xmath37 where , @xmath38 is the normalization factor .",
    "the hamiltonian here is , @xmath39 more explicitly , after tracing out the right - moving sector , as a check of consistency , it can be shown that the reduced density matrix becomes @xmath40 in the @xmath41 limit . as expected , this is the projector onto the left - moving sector s vacuum , since the ground state of the cft on the circle is just @xmath42 and hence the corresponding lree is zero",

    "these are the theories which have the modular invariant partition functions ( on the torus ) to be of the form @xmath58 and have all fields in their corresponding kac table to be present ( _ e.g. _  minimal models of the type @xmath59 in the ade classification ) . for theories of this kind",
    ", the cardy states can be written as @xcite , @xmath60 i.e.  @xmath61 .",
    "the result can now be expressed fully in terms of the modular @xmath1-matrix . using the real , symmetric and unitary properties of @xmath1 it is easy to see that only the second term gives a finite contribution .",
    "thus , for generic cardy states in diagonal cfts , the result for the lree is , @xmath62 it is worthwhile noting here that the finite contribution in , is completely independent of the scales involved in the system .",
    "quite interestingly , if we specifically choose the boundary state @xmath12 to be an ishibashi state , @xmath56  equation with @xmath63  then the lree can be completely recast in terms of the _ quantum dimensions _ of the cft .",
    "the quantum dimensions @xmath64 and the total quantum dimension @xmath65 are defined in terms of the elements of the modular @xmath1 matrix as follows @xcite @xmath66 ( the second relation follows from unitarity of @xmath1 ) .",
    "using the above definition , the left - right entanglement entropy corresponding to @xmath56 is @xcite @xmath67 it is well - known that gapless edge modes of ( 2 + 1)-@xmath0 tqft can be described by a chiral ( 1 + 1)-@xmath0 rational conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "hence , we interpret equation bulk quantities as follows .",
    "the first term in has the same structure of the area law of real - space entanglement entropy @xmath68 in two spatial dimensions .",
    "@xmath69 , therefore , corresponds to the spacing of the lattice on which the tqft lives .",

    "moreover , the second term , @xmath71 , is exactly the _ topological entanglement entropy _ , @xmath72 , of anyons of type @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this term is universal and captures global features of entanglement in ( 2 + 1)-@xmath0 tqfts .",
    "we can therefore rewrite equation as @xmath74 therefore , _",
    "the left - right entanglement entropy for ishibashi states precisely reproduces the spatial - entanglement entropy in ( 2 + 1)-@xmath0 _ @xcite .    .",
    "]    the result can be understood from the equivalence of the modular hamiltonian of the bulk theory with the hamiltonian of the chiral cft living on its edge @xcite .",
    "let us review this equivalence briefly .",
    "consider anyons in the topological sector @xmath73 living on a sphere @xmath75 ( see fig .  1 )",
    " of radius @xmath76  which is bipartitioned into its upper ( @xmath77 ) and lower ( @xmath78 ) hemispheres .",
    "the edge of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) has a chiral ( anti - chiral ) cft .",
    "the full hamiltonian of this system is , @xmath79 . here",
    ", @xmath80 is the rg - relevant interedge coupling between the left and right modes .",
    "it can then be shown , entanglement properties between @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be mapped to those between the left- and right - moving edge modes of the non - chiral cft living in the interedge region @xcite .",
    "therefore , tracing out the subsystem @xmath78 is tantamount to tracing out the right - moving modes .",
    "the result for the lree , for the specific cardy state @xmath81 ( equation with @xmath26 ) , also admits an expression in terms of the quantum dimensions . from , @xmath82",
    "the linear combination of ishibashi states in @xmath81 is such that the probability of @xmath13 , in the boundary state is @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "equivalently , from tqft fusion rules , it follows that the factor @xmath84 is also the probability of finding a quasiparticle of type @xmath73 in an anyonic gas at steady state @xcite .",
    "the second term can then be interpreted as the average topological entanglement entropy .",
    "as is evident from the formula , the lree can be readily calculated for the cardy states if we know the central charge and the modular @xmath1 matrix . in this section",
    ", we explicitly evaluate the lree for the ising model , the triticritical ising model and the @xmath2 wzw model .",
    "+      the ising model , which corresponds to the virasoro minimal model @xmath85 , has a central charge of @xmath86 .",

    "these primaries have weights @xmath90 respectively .",

    "the universal formula for lree contains .",
    "moreover , for the case of diagonal cfts with a specific choice of a boundary state , we see that the finite contribution to the lree can be fully formulated in terms of the quantum dimensions of the theory .",
    "our analysis also shows that this measure of entanglement precisely captures the spatial entanglement of a higher dimensional topological field theory .",
    "this therefore serves as an alternative derivation of topological entanglement entropy and explicitly illustrates the tqft / cft ( bulk / edge ) correspondence .",
    "it is worth seeking the usefulness and implications of this connection for the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , anyon superconductivity @xcite and topological quantum computing @xcite",
    ".    it shall be interesting to reproduce the lree using the methods of ads / cft @xcite .",
    "the topological nature of 3@xmath0 gravity may be useful in this regard .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning here , that the topological entanglement entropy corresponding to 3@xmath0 black holes having @xmath95 holonomies in the hyperbolic conjugacy class ( which are the analogs to quasiparticles of a specific type ) have already been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "this analysis can be hopefully extended to other conjugacy classes ( parabolic and elliptic ) and it may be possible to calculate the average topological entanglement entropy .",
    "concurrently , it would be useful to evaluate the equivalent quantity in a cft ( like liouville theory ) with large central charge and check the holographic consistency . another intriguing direction to pursue",
    "is to investigate this quantity for d@xmath96-branes .",
    "the methods developed in this paper and that of @xcite can be suitably utilized to calculate the lree . we can then try to understand whether this measure of entanglement can shed any new light on string theory @xcite .",
