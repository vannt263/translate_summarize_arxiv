    "following the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite , several groups have carried out microlensing surveys towards the galactic bulge ( gb ) , as seen in baade s window .",
    "it is now well understood that these observations are useful for studying the structure , dynamics and kinematics of the galaxy and the stellar mass function as the event rate and timescale distributions are related to the masses and velocities of lens objects .",
    "the amplification of a microlensing event is described by ( @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the projected separation of the source and lens in units of the einstein radius @xmath15 which is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lens mass , @xmath18 is the normalized lens distance and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the observer - lens and the observer - source star distances .",
    "the time variation of @xmath21 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the minimum impact parameter in units of @xmath15 , the time of maximum magnification , the event time scale and the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line of sight towards the source star , respectively . from a light curve , one can determine the values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath27 , but not the values of @xmath17 , @xmath28 or @xmath26 .",
    "our moa ( microlensing observations in astrophysics ) group started observations towards the gb in 1999 . from 2000",
    "we introduced the difference image analysis ( dia ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which is able to perform better photometry than the traditional dophot ( @xcite ) type analysis in crowded fields at any place even where no star was identified .    to date , hundreds of microlensing events have been detected towards the gb by the ogle ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and macho collaborations ( @xcite ) .",
    "they estimate the microlensing optical depth towards the gb to be @xmath29 from @xmath30 events by dophot analysis , @xmath31 from @xmath32 events in a clump giant subsample from dophot , and @xmath33 from @xmath34 events by dia respectively . @xcite and @xcite",
    "estimate values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively from macho data .",
    "these values are all more than twice those expected from existing galactic models , which are somewhere around @xmath37 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the standard models of the galaxy need to be revised . to explain the high optical depth ,",
    "a number of authors have suggested the presence of a bar oriented along our line of sight to the gb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and have adopted various values of the bar orientation and mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "microlensing observations towards the gb therefore appear useful for characterizing the mass and inclination of the bar .",
    "@xcite and @xcite raised the possibility of a systematic bias in the optical depth due to the difficulties of measuring @xmath27 associated with blending and unresolved sources .",
    "when the actual source base - line flux is unknown , @xmath27 and @xmath23 are degenerate in relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) events ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth may be estimated by using red clump giant stars to avoid the bias , or by other methods ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we quantify the bias by using monte carlo simulations and take itinto account to estimate the optical depth .",
    "our observations are designed to detect efficiently high magnification events with faint source stars for the study of extra - solar planets and surface - transit events , by increasing the sampling rate up to @xmath0 times per night ( note that the sampling rate of other projects is typically once per night ) .",
    "our observations are consequently fairly sensitive to short duration events , i.e. , events caused by smaller mass lenses .",
    "this could lead to a different optical depth estimate from previous studies if there is a significant contribution of low mass objects such as brown dwarfs to the microlensing optical depth .",
    "thus the moa observations can constrain the contribution of the low - mass population and also the structure of the gb . for this purpose here we present the results of moa observations .    in this paper ,",
    "the results of the dia analysis of data towards the gb taken by moa in 2000 with dia are presented .",
    "the analysis is aimed at finding how efficiently we can detect high magnification events and short timescale events , and at estimating the optical depth towards the gb . in ",
    "[ sec : observation ] we describe our observations .",
    " [ sec : dataanalysis ] is devoted to the analysis method . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we describe the event selection process and results . in ",
    "[ sec : extinction ] we make an @xmath5-band extinction map of our gb fields caused by dust .",
    "this is useful in estimating extinction free source magnitudes in the simulation . in ",
    "[ sec : opticaldepth ] we describe the simulation used to estimate our detection efficiency and the resultant microlensing optical depth . discussion and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we observed from the mt.john university observatory ( mjuo ) in new zealand at @xmath38e , @xmath39s , @xmath40 m altitude .",
    "typical sky background values are @xmath41 and @xmath42 magarcsec@xmath43 in the u , b , v , rc and ic passbands respectively at an air mass of @xmath44 ( gilmore , private communication , 1994 ) .",
    "spectroscopic hours are @xmath45 .",
    "we used a 61-cm telescope equipped with the large mosaic ccd camera moa - cam2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has three 2k @xmath46 4k pixels thinned ccds .",
    "the combined field of view of the camera and telescope is @xmath47 ( @xmath48 arcsecpixel@xmath49 ) .",
    "we used two non - standard wide passband red ( @xmath50 nm ) and blue ( @xmath51 nm ) filters .",
    "the global seeing is typically @xmath52 .",
    "we observed 14 gb fields ( @xmath53 deg@xmath4 ) @xmath54 times per night during the southern winter season ( from april to november ) , where each field consists of three subfields corresponding to each ccd .",
    "the main aim of the observations was to detect high magnification events in order to find extrasolar planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection probability of extrasolar planets in high magnification events is high ( @xcite ) .",
    "microlensing events in which the source star is fainter than the observational limiting magnitude , are generally known as `` pixel lensing '' events ( @xcite ) or `` eagle events '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these usually have high magnification .",
    "however , the period in which they are visible is very short , because they are visible only at peak of magnification . to detect this kind of events we sample each field @xmath55 times per day mainly through the red filter rather than both colors . due to this high sampling rate , the detection efficiency for short timescale events also becomes higher than the former studies .",
    "a unique feature of our observations is the ability to detect small lens objects towards the gb .",
    "we have used the dia technique to provide sensitivity to pixel lensing or eagle events .",
    "these events can not be detected by the conventional ( fixed position ) dophot - type photometry .",
    "we developed our own implementation of the dia method of @xcite and @xcite which directly model the kernel in real space with spatial variations of the kernel across the ccd .",
    "this method is suitable even for crowded and poor s / n images . in this technique ,",
    "one first registers some star positions , and geometrically aligns each `` current '' observation image to a preselected `` reference '' image which is recorded in good seeing , high s / n and low airmass .",
    "next , the convolution kernel which is required to map the reference image to the current image , is calculated by using the current and reference images .",
    "the reference images are convolved to match the seeing and scaled to align with the current images .",
    "the resultant images are then subtracted and variable objects are detected .",
    "the images were analyzed in real - time at mjuo to issue alerts for the events ( @xcite ) . in this analysis",
    "we use the same sample of subtracted images as in the real - time analysis .",
    "we have found the effect of differential refraction , which causes a significant residual flux in the subtracted image ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , is negligible in our images with the red filter when the airmass is lower than @xmath56 .",
    "we have not corrected for this effect because our data are mainly taken through the red filter .",
    "we have made a catalogue of all stars in the reference images by using dophot .",
    "all saturated stars and bad pixels on the reference images are masked out the same as in the subtraction process .",
    "these are useful in the following analyses .      on a subtracted image ,",
    "variable objects can be seen as positive or negative profiles depending on whether the flux had increased or decreased relative to the reference image .    to detect these objects",
    ", we use our implementation of the algorithm in the iraf task daofind , in which both positive and negative profiles could be detected simultaneously .",
    "there are also spurious profiles not associated with stellar variability , for example , cosmic rays , satellite tracks and electrons leaked from bright saturated star images . to avoid detecting these spurious objects",
    ", we apply several criteria about the statistics and profiles in the analog digital unit ( adu ) value of pixels around the peak , e.g. , s / n is required to be larger than 3 .",
    "candidate objects which pass these criteria are checked against those obtained in previous reductions of the field .",
    "if no object is cross - referenced , these new objects are added to the initial list of variable object positions .",
    "if an object has previously been detected , this is identified as the same object and the number of detections for this object is incremented .",
    "the number of detections for each object is used in the event selection cut `` cut1 '' ( see  [ sec : cut1 ] ) .",
    "to the list of variable objects made in the previous section , we have applied the first simple event selection `` cut1 '' ( see  [ sec : cut1 ] ) to cull the number of spurious objects in this list .    for the objects which passed the `` cut1 '' test , we have performed psf profile fitting photometry , where the high s / n empirical psf images ( @xmath57 pixels ) is made for each of the 32 ( @xmath58 pixels ) sub - regions in the reference image",
    ". then these psf images are convolved by the same kernel function used in the subtraction process , to match this psf to that in each local position of each time series of frames . and the total flux of this psf is normalized to @xmath59 .",
    "the psf photometry comes down to a two - parameter fit for the amplitude @xmath60 and base line @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 , here @xmath63 is the value of empirical psf image in pixel @xmath64 centered on the variable object . in principal , in subtracted images ,",
    "the background is zero by virtue of the least - square process .",
    "however , in fact , there are residuals especially around the very bright saturated stars , bright variable stars and in poor s / n images . in our images ,",
    "the fraction of the area where these effects occur is small but not negligible because of the wide wing of the psf ( our median seeing is about @xmath65 ) .",
    "when we compared the 1-parameter and 2-parameter fits , we found that several faint stars around a bright variable star show similar variability as the bright variable star in the 1-parameter fit , but not in the 2-parameter fit .",
    "fitting a 2nd `` base line flux '' parameter on the subtracted images provides a good zero - point check .",
    "so we make the base line @xmath61 a fitting parameter . in the subtracted images",
    "the flux has been rescaled to match that in the reference image by dividing with the scale factor @xmath66 which is the first coefficient of the kernel function of the frame . by this process",
    ", all the time series of subtracted images are photometrically calibrated .",
    "then no extinction correction is required . in the fitting",
    ", the noise of each pixel @xmath67 of the subtracted image is given from the actual flux @xmath68 in the current image before subtraction , taking account of the gain @xmath69 in adu / e@xmath70 and the scale factor @xmath66 of each frame .",
    "this photometry has been performed on all objects in the variable list in all the time series of images and the differential flux @xmath71 light curves stored in the database with their corresponding error and the square root of the reduced @xmath72 in the psf fitting ( we refer to this as @xmath73 ) .",
    "the error in the psf photometry @xmath74 obtained by @xmath72 fitting would be optimistic , as it includes only the photon noise component .",
    "so we test the properties of the photometry using a sample of constant stars .",
    "we have randomly sampled @xmath75 constant stars for each image from our star catalogue , in which we have rejected the variable objects detected in  [ sec : detect ] .",
    "noise properties are derived from the residuals of individual measurements around the mean flux of each object .",
    "so we use @xmath76 measurements for each chip .",
    "each residual is normalized by the error from the photon noise @xmath74 for the corresponding photometric point .",
    "then stars are grouped according to their brightness on the reference image , the standard deviation normalized by @xmath74 in the psf fitting , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "we think that the @xmath73 of each measurement should be a good indicator for the systematic noise which comes from the non - photon noise .",
    "all residuals coming from the light curves of stars in a given group are merged into one distribution .    for each group",
    "we calculate the half width of the region containing @xmath77 of residuals @xmath78 , a robust estimator of the width @xmath79 of the gaussian distribution . in figure",
    "[ fig : sdev - sig ] , we plot the estimated @xmath78 as a function of @xmath73 and these are fitted with a 3-degree polynomial .",
    "here bright stars ( @xmath80 in dophot output red magnitude , which corresponds to @xmath81 ; see  [ sec : calibration ] ) are rejected because such bright stars have other systematic deviations as discussed below .",
    "the effect of such bright stars is small since , in total , they represent less than @xmath82 of all possible source stars ( @xmath83 ) , and the pixels where such stars dominate on the ccd chip is less than @xmath84",
    ". we did not use those measurements with @xmath85 as they are unreliable .",
    "the fraction of such measurements is @xmath86 out of all measurements . in this figure ,",
    "a clear trend for these values can be seen , and the fitted curve can be used to rescale the error bars in order to improve the consistency of the light curves .",
    "we also show the same plot normalized with this fitted function in figure [ fig : sdev - sig ] .",
    "to check whether this normalization is appropriate or not , we show the distribution histograms of these residuals ( upper panel ) and normalized residuals ( lower panel ) in figure [ fig : residual ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : residual ] , the distribution of normalized residuals is consistent with the normal distribution .",
    "so our normalization seems to be reasonable .",
    "this exercise have been carried out for each of the ccd chips which showed that chips 2 and 3 are very similar but differ slightly from chip 1 .",
    "so we have estimated this function for each chip .",
    "this trend is very similar over all fields measured with the same ccd chip .",
    "we have applied this normalization to all our measurements .",
    "we also show the @xmath78 of residuals ( filled circle ) and normalized residuals ( cross ) as a function of brightness of constant stars in @xmath5-band magnitude ( see  [ sec : calibration ] ) in figure [ fig : mag - sig ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mag - sig ] , as we move towards brighter stars the @xmath78 increases due to systematic effects related to the uncertainty in the seeing and the psf , first slowly and then faster .",
    "@xcite provide a possible explanation in terms of the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "another possible source of this excess is the existence of some small amplitude variable stars in these bright stars .",
    "no correction for this effect is made in this analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig : mag - sig ] , we find that the noise ( standard deviation ) in this analysis is about @xmath87 above the photon noise limit .      to obtain the source magnitude from the baseline flux @xmath88 given by light curve fitting , we need the transformation relation between the flux in the reference image and the apparent magnitude in standard passbands .",
    "we use the ubvi photometry catalogue of selected stars in baade s window provided by ogle ( @xcite ) that are contained in three moa gb subfields ( ngb2 - 1 , ngb2 - 2 , ngb3 - 3 , where ngb2 - 1 means chip 1 in field ngb2 ) . in these regions ,",
    "the extinction is relatively low and uniform .",
    "our star catalogue have been made by applying dophot to half of all the frames for each field which contain @xmath89 blue images taken during the 2000 season .",
    "then we have made the @xmath90 and @xmath91 catalogue of all stars in our gb fields by taking the median for each star so as to increase the accuracy of the photometry and to avoid the daily difference of extinction by the atmosphere .",
    "then the dophot photometry @xmath92 of the reference images is compared with the catalogue value @xmath93 .",
    "the differences are @xmath94 mag and spatial variations in one chip are about @xmath95 mag .",
    "so we have neglected local differences in the chip and stored one offset value for each chip .",
    "these offsets are used in the following calibrations .",
    "next , the @xmath96 and @xmath97 measurements in our catalogue of @xmath98 moa - ogle overlap fields are compared with the @xmath99 and @xmath5 photometry of the corresponding star in the ogle catalogue .",
    "fundamentally the transformation to the standard @xmath99 and @xmath5 from moa non - standard @xmath96 and @xmath97 depends on the color index @xmath100 .",
    "the transformations obtained to the standard @xmath5 and @xmath99 for each chip are shown in figure [ fig : rmed - i_color ] and [ fig : bmed - v_color ] , and are given by following equations .",
    "@xmath101    @xmath102    here the slopes were estimated by the using full data of all 3 chips , and the offsets were estimated individually for each chip .",
    "we apply these transformations to our star catalogue .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : rmed - i_color ] , the color dependence in transformation to @xmath5 from @xmath96 is weak , and we find that the transformation without a color term seems to work properly , as shown in figure [ fig : rmed - i ] .",
    "the transformation functions can be written as follows    @xmath103    these equations are very useful because our data were usually taken only in red .",
    "all data consist of @xmath104 images ( @xmath105 gbyte ) which correspond to @xmath106 frames for each field depending on their priority . of these , @xmath107 images ( @xmath108 ) have been successfully reduced .",
    "the reduction failures occur as a result of poor data conditions , i.e. , bad pointing , poor seeing and very low transmission due to clouds .    in these subtracted images",
    "we find @xmath109 variable objects in each field . and",
    "@xmath110 of these variable objects pass the `` cut1 '' , for which the psf photometry is performed to make the light curves .",
    "for these light curves , we apply an additional selection , i.e. , `` cut2 '' which search for a bump in the light curve and `` cut3 '' in which microlensing fitting is performed . as a result , we find @xmath1 microlensing event candidates from these light curves .",
    "we apply a combination of simple selection criteria to reject the various spurious detections and variable stars .",
    "these criteria are chosen empirically .",
    "we have applied a simple selection criterion termed `` point cut '' for the initial variable objects detected in  [ sec : detect ] by using the number of detections of each object in a time series of frames .",
    "there are 3 type of events in our data set .",
    "the first one is the event in which the source star is not magnified in the reference frame .",
    "the second one is that in which the source star is magnified to its maximum amount relative to the reference image .",
    "the third one is in - between , i.e. , the source star is magnified but not at the peak magnification relative to the reference image . for type 1",
    ", objects are detected only when the source is magnified as a positive excess . for type 2",
    ", objects are detected in almost all frames except around the peak as a negative excess . and",
    "for type 3 , the same excess as for types 1 and 2 , or the combination of a cluster of positive excesses at the peak and a negative base line are detected depending on the phase of magnification in the reference image .",
    "first we count the number of clusters of positive and negative detections @xmath111 and @xmath112 which are the consecutive detections whose separation are less than @xmath113 observation frames .    for type 1 which has the no negative detections @xmath114",
    ", the positive detection should be larger than 2 , i.e. , @xmath115 , which rejects many spurious detections and low s / n events .",
    "@xmath111 should be less than 4 to reject short period variables , and @xmath116 should not be equal to @xmath111 to reject objects with noisy sparse detections .",
    "we divide all frames into three regions of observation time , and calculate the detection ratio @xmath117 which is the number of detections @xmath118 out of all observation frames @xmath119 .",
    "we require that the @xmath120 or @xmath121 to reject some of the long or middle period variables .    for type 2 , which has the no positive detection @xmath122 ,",
    "the negative detection should be larger than a quarter of all observation frames , i.e. , @xmath123 because these negative detections represent the base line .",
    "@xmath112 should be less than 5 to reject short period variables because the base line should be stable .    for type 3 which has both positive and negative detections",
    ", @xmath111 should be less than 4 , and @xmath112 should be less than 5 to reject short period variables , the same as for types 1 and 2 .",
    "either of the criteria for type1 @xmath124 and @xmath125 , or for type2 @xmath126 should be satisfied .",
    "we list all criteria of cut1 in table [ tbl : cut1 ] .",
    "these cuts reduce the variable objects from thousands ( @xmath127 ) to hundreds ( @xmath110 ) , depending on each field , without rejecting the microlensing - like light curves . for these objects",
    "the psf photometry is performed to construct light curves .",
    "the second cut `` cut2 '' have been applied to the light curves of objects which passed `` cut1 '' .",
    "this cut search for a microlensing - like `` bump '' on the stable baseline in the light curve .",
    "first , we require that the number of photometric data points @xmath128 should be @xmath129 points .",
    "next we set the time interval of @xmath130 days as a `` window '' in the light curve , where the number of data points in the window @xmath131 and outside the window @xmath132 is required to be more than 3 and 9 points respectively . in this window , we count the number of peaks @xmath133 , which is defined to be that consecutive excess whose significance is larger than @xmath134 and at least the significance of @xmath135 points of these should larger than @xmath136 . here",
    "the significance of each photometric point is calculated as follows    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the flux and error of the @xmath64th data point , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the median and variance of data points outside the window .",
    "@xmath133 is required to satisfy @xmath142 , and the maximum of the sum of the significance of the points in each peak @xmath143 should be larger than 20 .",
    "we define a high excess as one or more consecutive data points whose significance is larger than @xmath134 , i.e. , all excesses including `` peak '' defined above and one which is not significant to categorize as a `` peak '' .",
    "the number of the high excesses @xmath144 in the window should be less than 6 , which rejects short period variables and noisy light curves .",
    "we require that the reduced chi - square of data outside the window @xmath145 should be less than 4 .",
    "but if the ratio of chi - square inside and outside the window @xmath146 is larger than 15 , the cut with @xmath145 is not required , so as to allow the high s / n long duration events to pass .",
    "we list all these criteria of cut2 in table [ tbl : cut2 ] .    in this `` cut2 '' , @xmath147",
    "light curves have been reduced to @xmath148 in all our gb fields .      for the light curves which passed cut2 ,",
    "the microlensing model fitting with equation ( [ eq : amp - u ] ) have been applied in cut3 . in dophot analysis",
    "the fittings are performed with the background blending flux @xmath149 , i.e. , @xmath150 , where @xmath151 indicates a baseline source flux .",
    "however , in dia , we observe only the variation of the flux from that in the reference image as follows    @xmath152    where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the time when the current and the reference image are taken respectively .",
    "@xmath149 is canceled out in this formula .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : deltaf ] ) with four parameters ( @xmath155 ) is fitted to differential flux @xmath156 light curves in this cut3",
    ".    the reduced chi - squares @xmath72 in a microlensing fit are required to be less than 3.5 to reject most of lpvs and noisy light curves , although very high s / n events are sometimes not well fitted by the standard microlensing model because of exotic effects such as parallax .",
    "so , for the events whose peak flux is larger than @xmath157 adu , we require @xmath158 instead of @xmath159 .",
    "the event ngb1 - 2 - 2717 falls into this category because of the parallax effect .",
    "after these cuts , 75 light curves still remain , most of which have a clear single peak and stable baseline .",
    "these are microlensing candidates , dwarf novae ( dn ) and low s / n faint lpvs .    the main background in this event selection are dn which can be well fitted by microlensing in the case of poor sampling . in our light curves which passed the cut1 ,",
    "20 light curves are clearly identified as dn .",
    "these have single or sometimes multiple asymmetric flares in the light curve , which usually rise quickly and fade slowly .    to check whether an object is dn or not , we cross - referenced to the existing light curves in the macho group s database ( http://wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca/ ) whose fields overlap some of ours , and found other flares in the light curves of 5 objects , i.e. , these are clearly dn .",
    "the dn are much bluer during the outburst .",
    "however we usually observe only with the red filter to increase the sampling rate , and only rarely observe with the blue ( only @xmath160 frames for each field ) . for 23 out of these 75 candidates , we could measure the color during the flare .",
    "five of these 23 candidates are categorized as dn because they are very blue ( @xmath161 ) . in 15 light curves , including 5 of the above 10 dn , asymmetric flares are clearly seen . in total 20 objects",
    "are categorized as dn .",
    "two of these dn are rejected at cut2 . and",
    "one dn is removed at @xmath72 by cut3 . to reject other dn , we are unable to use a color cut because we have no color information in most of the light curves .",
    "on the other hand we have frequent sampling data points for these objects , which makes it easier to identify a dn from the shape .",
    "and we find the following cuts would reject almost all dn in addition to lpvs .",
    "the minimum impact parameter @xmath162 should be less than 1 .",
    "15 dn are fitted with a large @xmath162 .",
    "some of lpvs are also cut here .",
    "furthermore we impose the condition that the timescale should be @xmath163 days .",
    "two further dn are rejected here , which are fitted to very large event timescales ( @xmath164 days ) . in consequence ,",
    "all dn which have been clearly identified are rejected by these cuts .",
    "though 5 of these have been identified as dn not by a clear shape of the flare but by their color or by the existence of other flares in past data , which can be done randomly , these are rejected by our cuts .",
    "these results give us the confidence that all dn are rejected by these cuts .",
    "even if a few dn are not rejected , it should not be a significant fraction in our results . at the same time",
    "9 microlensing - like light curves , which could not be clearly identified as either dn or microlensing events , are rejected with this cut . in microlensing events measured only around the peak or with low s / n , @xmath27 and @xmath162 would be degenerate ( @xcite ) .",
    "so some real microlensing events might be removed at this cut .",

    "this does show the dramatic capability of dia .",
    "especially note that this effect is increased by the high sampling rate strategy that we have adopted . though the sensitivity of the macho group ( @xcite ) became 2 magnitudes deeper than their observation limiting magnitude of @xmath229 by dia , that of moa is @xmath185 magnitude deeper than our observation limiting magnitude of @xmath224 .",
    "( of course , this effect also depends on the shape of the luminosity function around the observation limiting magnitude for each experiment . )",
    "the longer the timescale is , the fainter the source events that could be detected .    in the top - right panel in figure",

    "[ sec : cut3 ] , many possible microlensing events are rejected by the condition @xmath231 days in cut3 .",
    "these events have a significant increase in @xmath232 f , but their parameters could not be well constrained , because the light curve have been measured only around the peak . if the baseline flux is measured by the follow - up observations , @xmath27 could be constrained .",
    "if we make a catalogue of all variable stars and dn as now we are doing , or if we observe with two colors , we could easily identify the real microlensing events and issue alerts without the @xmath231 days criterion .",
    "we show the expected event rates without the cut @xmath231 days in the bottom - left panel of figure [ fig : eff_event_i ] . in this figure",

    "on the other hand , no significant change can be seen for the short timescale events , though the duration of the excess in the light curve of these events are as short as that of the long timescale faint source event .",
    "so , the efficiency for the short timescale events is not affected by this criterion .    to compare these results with the traditional dophot analysis in which the source star should be resolved in the reference image",
    ", we show the same distributions by using only the moa luminosity function ( filled circle points in figure [ fig : lf ] ) as the source luminosity distribution in the bottom - right panel of figure [ fig : eff_event_i ] .",
    "this is not actually the same case as with dophot , because the dia can improve the photometric accuracy , even for stars resolved in the reference image .",
    "furthermore there are many faint source events which are blended by bright resolved stars .",
    "these effects will cancel each other . in any case",
    "they are relatively small effects when compared with the differences in the dia and dophot analysis .",

    "the dia method increases the number of events by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "in particular we can detect many events in which the source stars are fainter than the observational limiting magnitude by using dia .      because of the simple geometry of microlensing , the probability distribution of the minimum impact parameter @xmath234 is uniform . in actual experiments , however , the distribution of the detection efficiency in @xmath162 , i.e. the expected event rate distribution , is biased towards smaller @xmath162 , because the high amplification makes it easier to detect the event .",
    "this effect can be seen in our observed @xmath162 distribution ( histogram ) and the estimated one in the simulation ( lines ) for various timescales which are scaled to match the histogram at @xmath235 as shown in figure [ fig : umin_eff ] . here",
    "the lines are the mean efficiencies for all our fields .",
    "these observed and estimated distributions are in good agreement for the range of the observed timescales ( between @xmath236 days ) .    in this figure",
    "we can see that half of the detected events have a small minimum impact parameter ( @xmath237 ) , though the fraction of events with @xmath238 is only @xmath239 in the dophot analysis ( @xcite ) and @xmath240 in the recent dia analysis ( @xcite ) by the macho group .",
    "this is because our sampling rate is higher ( @xmath241 timesday@xmath49 ) than theirs ( once per day ) .",
    "if events which fail by the criterion @xmath231 days , are included as mentioned in the previous section , then @xmath242 more high magnification events would be expected .",

    "<S> these observed optical depths are consistent with previous measurements by the macho and ogle groups , and still higher than those predicted by existing galactic models . </S>",
    "<S> we present the timescale distribution of the observed events , and find there are no significant short events of a few days , in spite of our high detection efficiency for short timescale events down to @xmath11 days . </S>",
