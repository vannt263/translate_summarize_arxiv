    "we can make examples of higher bridge links satisfying the rectangle condition by similar construction .",
    "now the result is summarized as follows .",
    "the rectangle condition for the generalized heegaard splitting of a @xmath1-fold branched covering can be checked by the arcs and loops as in @xmath103 of figure 11 , i.e. the rectangles formed by these arcs and loops are lifted to rectangles for the quasi - tightness of the heegaard splitting of @xmath1-fold branched cover .",
    "if it satisfies the rectangle condition , then any thin surface in the @xmath1-fold branched cover is incompressible .    if it satisfies the rectangle condition , the generalized heegaard splitting is strongly irreducible .",
    "then by @xcite , any thin surface in the generalized heegaard splitting is incompressible .",
    "while a thin level of lowest width is incompressible @xcite , in general a thin level surface can possibly be compressible in the link complement @xcite .",
    "we have the following .",
    "the rectangle condition implies that every thin meridional planar level surface is incompressible in the link complement .",
    "let @xmath4 be a thin level surface for the link @xmath142 .",
    "suppose @xmath227 is compressible and let @xmath33 be a compressing disk for @xmath228 .",
    "@xmath18 decomposes @xmath4 into two disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "since @xmath33 is a compressing disk , both @xmath229 and @xmath230 intersects @xmath142 , in even number of points .",
    "let @xmath231 be the branched covering map .",
    "then @xmath232 is a disjoint union of two disks @xmath233 , where @xmath234 @xmath53 and @xmath235 is essential in @xmath236 .",
    "( @xmath237 cuts @xmath236 into two non - disk components @xmath238 and @xmath239 . )",
    "this means that the thin surface @xmath236 is compressible in @xmath12 , which contradicts proposition 5.1 .",
    "let @xmath240 be a composite knot . put a thin position of @xmath241 vertically over a thin position of @xmath242 and",
    "do a connected sum operation by vertical arcs .",
    "this gives a presentation of @xmath142 from which we can see that @xmath243 .",
    "there are cases where equality holds , that is , width is additive under connected sum .",
    "rieck and sedgwick showed that it is true for small knots @xcite .",
    "however , recently blair and tomova showed that width is not additive in general @xcite .      if a thin position of a knot @xmath142 induces a strongly irreducible generalized heegaard splitting of the @xmath1-fold branched cover of @xmath244 , then the thin position of @xmath142 is the connect sum of thin position of prime summands of @xmath142 vertically",
    ". therefore @xmath142 satisfies the additivity of knot width ."
