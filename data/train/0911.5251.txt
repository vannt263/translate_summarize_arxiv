    "<S> we report on a new method to determine the degree of bulk spin polarization in single crystal co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 by modeling magnetic compton scattering with _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> spin - dependent compton profiles were measured for cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 . the _ ab initio _ calculations were then refined by rigidly shifting the bands to provide the best fit between the calculated and experimental directional profiles for each sample . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk spin polarizations , @xmath5 , corresponding to the spin - polarized density of states at the fermi level , were then extracted from the _ refined _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the values were found to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 for cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , determinations of @xmath5 weighted by the fermi velocity ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) were obtained , permitting a rigorous comparison with other experimental data and highlighting the experimental dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> spintronic materials are the subject of considerable research and rapid technological development . in these materials and devices , </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to exploit the electron spin for applications such as data storage and read - heads . </S>",
    "<S> some commercial devices exist , for example magnetic random access memory devices ( mram ) being based on the concept of spin - dependent tunneling magnetoresistance @xcite . because of the potential for the development of novel devices using spin transport in semiconductors , so - called spin - injector materials ( which would act as a source of highly spin - polarized electrons ) currently attract considerable interest . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious choice for a spin injector is a ferromagnetic system since it naturally has an imbalance of the electron spin population at the fermi level and thus possesses a degree of spin polarization . ideally , materials for applications would be fully spin - polarized ` half - metals ' ( hms ) , where the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy ( @xmath10 ) is finite for one spin but zero for the other , such that carriers of only one spin exist at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> however , ferromagnets typically only possess partial spin polarization . despite much theoretical and experimental effort </S>",
    "<S> , only a few promising candidates , such as cro@xmath2 @xcite , optimally doped la@xmath11sr@xmath12mno@xmath13 @xcite and co@xmath14mnal@xmath0sn@xmath1 @xcite have been found to exhibit high polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> recently , co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 has garnered interest resulting from predictions of half - metallicity and the potential to _ tune _ the polarization via fe doping . </S>",
    "<S> the consensus is that doping simply adjusts the fermi level @xcite , without altering the bandstructure . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of altering the magnitude of the polarization makes this material ideal for fundamental research on spin polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization can be defined simply in terms of the spin - dependent density of states ( dos ) , @xmath15 , at the fermi level . however , in order to facilitate comparison with various experimental techniques , it is useful to expand this definition to weight @xmath15 with the fermi velocity , @xmath16 . hence , following mazin @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> p@xmath17 _ can be defined such that ,    @xmath18    for @xmath19 , as quoted by most theoretical studies , @xmath20 is solely defined by the dos . </S>",
    "<S> weighting with the fermi velocity accounts for transport properties , with @xmath21 in the ballistic or @xmath22 in the diffusive regimes . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the direct measurement of the polarization has proven to be a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , except for the case of a hm where @xmath23 is @xmath24 , the appropriate value of @xmath25 is often ambiguous , and consequently comparison with theory is possible , but notoriously difficult @xcite . in point - contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) </S>",
    "<S> measurements , for example , the value of @xmath25 is not the same for all materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bulk techniques such as saturation magnetization or transport measurements can only give an indication of half - metallicity , and techniques which give access to the magnitude of @xmath5 directly such as spin polarized photoemission or pcar are heavily dependent on the surface quality of the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , we demonstrate that a magnetic compton scattering study combined with _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations can be used to extract @xmath23 in the representative pyrite - type series co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> fine tuning the theory to experiment enables the spin polarization to be determined for @xmath19 as well as the weighted values for @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic compton scattering is a valuable tool for the investigation of spin - dependent effects as the incoming hard x - rays directly probe the twice - integrated momentum distribution of the unpaired electrons in the bulk @xcite . a compton profile ( cp ) </S>",
    "<S> represents the 1d projection of the electron momentum density . </S>",
    "<S> if the difference between the cps is measured for opposite applied magnetic field directions , the resulting difference profile contains only the spin - dependent part of the momentum distribution ; this is referred to as the magnetic compton profile ( mcp ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the directional mcps can be directly compared to the spin - dependent momentum distributions which have been computed from the _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculation ( from which the the polarization may also be calculated ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated previously @xcite that the agreement with experiment may be refined by iterating a rigid shift of the bands ( with respect to the fermi level ) contributing to the spin moment . in the case described here , this optimization is performed by minimizing the @xmath27 calculated simultaneously between the computed and measured mcps along four crystallographic directions . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk polarization @xmath5 , and the weighted polarization @xmath23 can then be calculated directly from the refined model bandstructure giving a direct experimental insight into not only the polarization but also the effect of the fermi velocity on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to extract all possible permutations of the polarization allows simple comparison with results from other studies .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) the dos of cos@xmath2 , where the sulphur @xmath28- and cobalt @xmath29-manifold are depicted for the majority and minority spin states . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the bandstructure of the @xmath30-manifold around the fermi level along a high symmetry path in the cubic brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> overall six bands composed of two in the majority ( blue , solid lines ) and four in the minority ( red , dashed lines ) channel cross the fermi level . ]    in order to test our method , we calculated the spin polarization of ni . </S>",
    "<S> for ni , a transport measurement determined @xmath31 to be @xmath32 experimentally @xcite , whereas _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations predict @xmath33 @xcite . for our refinement , </S>",
    "<S> we used experimental mcps for four crystallographic directions from dixon _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the refinement increased the value of @xmath31 from our _ ab initio _ value of 0% to @xmath34 , which agrees well with the previous experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> this simple test shows that it is a robust method for determining @xmath23     ( color online ) the dos in the @xmath30-manifold of ( a ) cos@xmath2 and ( b ) co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 is composed of six bands around the fermi level . as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosbands ] the dos of the majority and minority bands are blue and red , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dark and light colors signify band 1 and band 2 ( or in the minority channel , the combination of bands 24 ) , respectively . ]        </S>",
    "<S> bandstructure calculations predict cos@xmath2 to be a highly spin - polarized ferromagnet , just missing half - metallic behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level lies low in the conduction bands and doping with the isostructural semiconductor fes@xmath2 results in a reduction in the occupation of one spin channel . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that this would enable the polarization to be tuned to half metallicity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> saturation magnetization and transport measurements indicate a high spin polarization hinting towards possible half - metallicity at doping levels between @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the trend in the total dos at @xmath36 extracted from heat capacity and nuclear magnetic resonance follow this conjecture @xcite . however , pcar measurements of the absolute value of the magnetization reveal magnitudes of up to @xmath37 in the pure ( single crystal , @xcite ) and @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( polycrystalline , @xcite ) in the doped system . complementing these results , anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements </S>",
    "<S> show a change in sign of the polarization on doping , as predicted by _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the qualitative behavior of both experiment and theory are similar , the absolute values of @xmath5 disagree @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may be attributed in part to the sensitivity of pcar to @xmath8 ( such that @xmath40 ) , as opposed to the theoretical values which refer to @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the current study , measurements were performed on cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 single crystals to investigate polarization effects at low doping . </S>",
    "<S> high quality single crystals were prepared by the chemical vapor transport method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particular care was taken to ensure stoichiometry and to avoid sulphur deficiency , which is known to affect the measured polarization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic compton scattering experiments were carried out at the beamline ( bl08w ) of spring-8 , japan . </S>",
    "<S> all experimental data were collected at a temperature of 10k . </S>",
    "<S> the mcps were subsequently corrected for detector efficiency , absorption , the relativistic cross - section and multiple scattering effects . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the saturation magnetization measured with a squid at 10k was determined to be 0.83 @xmath41co and 1.04 @xmath41co for the pure and @xmath42 samples .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic stucture of cos@xmath2 was computed using the linear muffin - tin orbital method ( lmto ) within the atomic sphere approximation including combined correction terms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange correlation part of the potential was described within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and the effect of doping was incorporated via the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . as observed in previous calculations , the moment at the experimental lattice constant of 5.5  is substantially underestimated @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> so the calculations presented here have been performed at 5.71 , producing moments which are 0.85@xmath41co and 0.92@xmath41co for the pure and @xmath42 systems respectively , in good agreement with the experimental values .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculation for cos@xmath2 are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosbands ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - resolved dos show the sulphur @xmath43-states below the cobalt @xmath44 manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> these states , which are hybridized with sulphur @xmath43-states , are split by the crystal field into @xmath45- and @xmath30-manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level lies low in the @xmath30-manifold where two majority bands and four minority bands cross @xmath36 ( see inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosbands ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the partial dos contributed by each band are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : partialdos](a ) . in the undoped compound , in both the majority and minority spin channel , </S>",
    "<S> band 1 holds the largest dos and is therefore expected to have the biggest impact on @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation predicts a polarization @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the bandstructure and partial dos for @xmath42 are broadly similar to the pure case and lead to @xmath47 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : partialdos]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations predict half - metallicity to occur for @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> overall these results are consistent with other theoretical band predictions @xcite .    the experimental and calculated mcps , resolved along different crystallographic directions , are shown in fig .  [ fig : mcps](a ) and [ fig : mcps](b ) for cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ ab initio _ theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the experimental mcps . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic structures in the directional differences of the magnetic compton profiles serve as a rigorous check on the calculation , and these are shown for the pairs of directions [ 100 ] - [ 110 ] in the insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mcps ] . in order to optimize the agreement between theory and experiment the energy bands </S>",
    "<S> were refined , as described earlier , to provide the best fit to the experimental mcps . </S>",
    "<S> small energy shifts of the bands crossing e@xmath49 change the detailed shape of the resultant mcp , the band positions were refined to give the best fit between the theoretical and experimental mcps , simultaneously for four crystallographic directions for cos@xmath2 and three for co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin moments calculated from these fits agree well with the experimental values , providing an independent consistency check .    despite small energy shifts of the bands ( @xmath50 mev ) , </S>",
    "<S> the fitting procedure sees the @xmath51 parameter reducing by @xmath52 from its starting value to the minimum and has an appreciable impact on the polarization . in the undoped case , </S>",
    "<S> the polarization decreases from the original value of @xmath53 to @xmath54 . here </S>",
    "<S> the error ( which is generally larger for more dispersive bands ) reflects the uncertainty of the fit . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease can be mainly attributed to majority band 2 being shifted above e@xmath49 and the dos of band 1 being decreased . for the @xmath42 compound , the polarization decreases from the original value of @xmath55 to @xmath56 , which is primarily due to the lowering of majority band 2 and an increased dos for the minority band .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) experimental pcar ( filled triangles ) polarization data compared to @xmath57 from the lmto calculation ( lines ) as a function of composition in 5% steps . </S>",
    "<S> the tuned calculations are also shown , where the bare @xmath5 is also weighted by the fermi velocity ( open symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sign change in the pcar data has been inferred from amr measurements . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the fitted bulk polarization @xmath58 obtained for cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] along with the results from the unfitted calculation for different compositions . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the original calculation for @xmath20 at different @xmath59 are in good agreement with previous theoretical studies @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the weighting with the fermi velocity has a significant effect on the nominal value of the polarization , particularly in the pure system where a weighting with @xmath9 results in a positive polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the fitted @xmath23 is qualitatively consistent with indirect measurements such as saturation magnetization , but imply that the maximum @xmath5 is not obtained at @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the tunability of the different polarization functions across the series of co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the data confirm that @xmath20 is negative in the pure and positive for the doped compound . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare our values for @xmath23 with the pcar results . in the case of the pure compound </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath60 is between @xmath20 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the @xmath42 composition @xmath62 is in close proximity to @xmath31 found in our study . </S>",
    "<S> this could indicate a doping dependent crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive regime in pcar measurements , which is consistent with the increase in resistivity observed for higher fe - doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , these discrepancies could be due to surface effects playing a role in the pcar measurements as pointed out by leighton _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although pcar has a penetration depth corresponding to the coherence length of the superconductor , the electrons crossing the interfacial barrier experience the surface potential . </S>",
    "<S> studies on the surface state of cos@xmath2 show that sulphur degradation could influence polarization measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far the surface stoichiometry of the alloyed composites has not been investigated .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new method to determine the bulk spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> although harder to put into practice , this novel technique calculates @xmath23 from a refined model bandstructure that is fitted to experimental mcps . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is free from surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> the case of ni shows that this approach is a rigorous method of determining the bulk @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the results on cos@xmath2 and co@xmath3fe@xmath4s@xmath2 illustrate the applicability of the approach in a more complex system , and highlight the degree to which the polarization is dependent on @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that there is a crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive transport regimes on doping with fe on the basis of the comparison with pcar measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the new method can be used to determine @xmath23 in such a way that its dependence on @xmath63 is unambiguous , and our results for co@xmath64fe@xmath65s@xmath2 demonstrate the importance of this . </S>"
