    "the astronomical observations indicate that the expansion of our universe accelerates @xcite . in the framework of the general relativity",
    "this means that about two thirds of the total energy density of the universe consists of dark energy : the still unknown component with a relativistic negative pressure @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological @xmath9-term or vacuum energy . during the cosmological evolution",
    "the @xmath9-term component has the constant ( lorentz invariant ) energy density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 .",
    "however the @xmath9-term requires that the vacuum energy density be fine tuned to have the observed very low value . for this reason",
    "the different forms of dynamically changing dark energy with an effective equation of state @xmath12 were proposed instead of the constant vacuum energy density . as a particular example of dark energy , the scalar field with some a slow rolling potential ( quintessence ) @xcite is often considered .",
    "the possible generalization of quintessence is a @xmath13-essence @xcite , the scalar field with a non - canonical lagrangian .",
    "present observation data constrain the range of equation - of - state of a dark energy as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "recently the chandra observations @xcite gave the similar restrictions on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "these data do not exclude the possibility of our universe to be filled with a phantom energy @xcite : the energy with a super - negative equation of state @xmath7 ( note , however , that the dark energy with the equation of state @xmath15 evolving from the quintessence - like @xmath16 in past , to phantom - like @xmath7 at present , provides the best fit for supernova data @xcite ) .",
    "the different aspects of phantom cosmology were considered in @xcite .",
    "the phantom energy is usually associated with the phantom or ghost fields  the scalar fields with wrong - sign kinetic term .",
    "it is known that such fields are unstable due to quantum instability of vacuum , unless the kinetic term stabilized by the ultra - violet cutoff @xcite .",
    "the intriguing possibility of constructing of effective @xmath7 from the scalar field with correct - sign kinetic term was proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors constructed the theory with the effective @xmath7 in the braneworld models .",
    "the presence of phantom energy in the universe leads to the interesting physical phenomena : the possibility of the big rip scenario @xcite , the black hole mass decreasing by phantom energy accretion @xcite and a new type of wormhole evolution @xcite .",
    "the alternatives to a scalar field model are the perfect fluid models such as a chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "hao and li @xcite demonstrated that @xmath17 state is an attractor for the chaplygin gas and equation of state of this gas could approach to this attractor from the either @xmath7 or @xmath16 sides .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the perfect fluid model with a general linear equation of state @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "this is a generalization of a homogeneous linear equation of state ( @xmath18 ) and is suitable for the modelling either the linear gas with @xmath19 or the dark energy with @xmath20 .",
    "the advantage of the use of the general linear equation of state is the possibility to describe the dark energy with a positive squared sound speed ( for the usually considered equation of state @xmath0 the dark energy is hydrodynamically unstable , because @xmath21 ) .",
    "the considered linear model is reduced to the perfect fluid model with @xmath22 at the particular case of @xmath18 .    in the framework of this model it is possible to find analytical cosmological solutions for the arbitrary values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we show below that this linear model ( unlike the chaplygin gas model ) describes distinctively different types of cosmological scenarios : the big bang , big crunch , big rip , anti - big rip , solutions with de the sitter attractor , bouncing solutions , and their various combinations .",

    "[ gen ] in which the basic properties and particular analytical solutions for a perfect fluid cosmology with a linear equation of state are derived .",
    "we show that dark energy with the equation of state @xmath2 may be effectively reduced to the @xmath9-term and to the simplified linear equation of state @xmath23 . in this case , either the effective density @xmath24 or the density of an effective @xmath9-term may in general have the negative values . in dependence of signs of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4",
