    "two dimensional ( 2d ) materials can be mostly exfoliated into individual thin layers from stacks of strongly bonded layers with weak interlayer interaction .",
    "a famous example is graphene  @xcite and its analogs such as boron nitride  @xcite .",
    "the 2d exfoliate versions of transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite exhibit properties that are complementary to distinct from those in graphene .",
    "mos@xmath0 ( the polytype is 2h - mos@xmath0 has trigonal prismatic coordination ) is a hexagonal crystal layered structure with a covalently bonded s - mo - s hexagonal quasi - two dimensional network which does not have inversion symmetry , packed by weak van der waals interactions .",
    "the monolayer of mos@xmath0 has provided a new material with a peculiar structure for the charge and the spin interactions  @xcite .",
    "there is a transition from an indirect band gap of @xmath3 ev in a bulk structure to a direct band gap of @xmath4 ev in the monolayer structure  @xcite .",
    "this direct band gap opens the possibility of many optoelectronic applications  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 also enables valley polarization  @xcite since both the conduction and valence band edges have two energy - degenerate valleys at the corners of the first brillouin zone and valley selective circular dichroism arising from its symmetry .",
    "ruderman - kittle - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction is an indirect interaction between nuclei of transition metals or magnetic impurities , mediated by the conduction electrons  @xcite .",
    "this interaction is directly related to the spin susceptibility of the host metal .",
    "rudermann and kittel first suggested  @xcite that the spin oscillatory interaction in metals could provide a long - range interaction between nuclear spins and explored the effective magnetic interaction between nuclei of transition metals and thus described the reason for broadening of spin resonance line diagram .",
    "due to the fact that the rkky interaction is originated by the exchange coupling between the impurity moments and the spin of itinerant electrons in the bulk of the system , a spin splitting owing to spin - orbit coupling , must have opposite sign at the two valleys by the requirement of time - reversal symmetry , is expected to influence directly this interaction . since the two inequivalent valleys in the monolayer mos@xmath0 are separated in the brillouin zone by a large momentum , in the case of the absence of short - range interactions , intervalley scattering  @xcite should be negligible and thus the valley index becomes a new quantum number . therefore , manipulating valley quantum number can produce new physical effects .    in the monolayer mos@xmath0 ,",
    "the highest energy valence bands and the lowest energy conduction bands , at the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valleys in momentum space , are mainly of molybdenum @xmath7orbital character and spin - orbit interactions split  @xcite the valence bands by @xmath8 mev leading to a spin polarization of the valence band .",
    "a minimal effective band model hamiltonian of mos@xmath0 is found by xiao et al  @xcite with parameters based on first principle calculations .",
    "to first order in momenta , the first part of hamiltonian describes the dynamics of massive dirac fermions which are studied from the graphene committees .",
    "it is commonly known that the rkky interaction in massless graphene is quite different  @xcite from that of a shcrdinger 2d electron liquid .",
    "the second part of the hamiltonian illustrates the spin - orbit interaction which leads to coupled spin and valley physics in the monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "the rkky interaction usually yields a heisenberg coupling refereing to a parallel or antiparallel coupling of localized spins . if spin of conduction electrons processes , it can be possibly to produce a noncollinear dzyaloshinsky - moriaya ( dm ) coupling of localized spins .",
    "we thus use this model hamiltonian to calculate the exchange interaction between localized spins on the mos@xmath0 and show that , in particular , combination of the spin - valley with a massive dirac - like spectrum can mediate a much richer collective behavior of magnetic adatoms .",
    "the rkky interaction in 2d electron gas in the presence of a rashba spin - orbit coupling has been studied by imamura et al .",
    "@xcite and they showed that rotation of the spin of conduction electrons causes a twisted rkky interaction which consists of three different terms , the heisenberg , dm and ising interactions .",
    "moreover , the rkky interaction between localized magnetic moments in a disordered 2d electron gas with both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings has been studied  @xcite .",
    "the disorder - averaged susceptibility leads to a twisted exchange interaction suppressed exponentially with distance , whereas the second - order correlations , which determine the fluctuations of the rkky energy , decay with the same power law as in the clean case .    in this work",
    ", we calculate the rkky interaction mediated by spin - orbit coupled massive dirac fermions in a monolayer mos@xmath0 using the green s function method .",
    "we show that the interaction consists of three terms without having the rashba or dresselhaus interaction and show particularly that the interaction behaves like @xmath2 for the long distance between two localized spins .",
    "the dm coupling leads to a rotation of the spinors of magnetic moments with respect to each other .",
    "in addition a beating pattern for the interaction , in the cases where the monolayer mos@xmath0 system is doped , is obtained . as we mentioned before",
    ", the model hamiltonian can be reduced to a massive graphene by discarding the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "besides @xmath9 dependence of the interaction for undoped massless graphene , we find that the interaction decays like @xmath2 for a massive and doped graphene . however , for a massive and undoped graphene , the interaction decays rapidly in a good agreement with those results obtained in ref .",
