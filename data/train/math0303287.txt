    "_ young tableaux _ and _ young walls _ play important roles in the interplay , which can be explained in a beautiful manner using the _ crystal base theory _ for quantum groups , between the fields of representation theory and combinatorics . indeed , since representation theory is known to be a vital tool in the solution of certain kinds of two - dimensional solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics , young tableaux and young walls are central ingredients in mathematical physics .",
    "the _ quantum groups _ introduced by drinfeld and jimbo , independently are deformations of the universal enveloping algebras of kac - moody algebras @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a kac - moody algebra and @xmath1 be its universal enveloping algebra .",
    "then , for each generic parameter @xmath2 , we associate a hopf algebra @xmath3 , called the quantum group , whose structure tends to that of @xmath1 as @xmath2 approaches @xmath4 .",
    "the important feature of quantum groups is that the representation theory of @xmath1 is the same as that of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 be a @xmath1-module in the category @xmath6 , which has a weight space decomposition @xmath7 .",

    "therefore , to understand the structure of representations over general quantum groups @xmath3 , it is enough to understand that of representations over @xmath3 for some special parameter @xmath2 which is easy to treat .    the _ crystal bases _ , introduced by kashiwara @xcite , can be viewed as bases at @xmath13 for the integrable modules over quantum groups and they are given a structure of colored oriented graph , called the _ crystal graphs _ , which reflect the combinatorial structure of integrable modules .    for classical lie algebras ,",
    "kashiwara and nakashima gave an explicit realization of crystal bases for finite dimensional irreducible modules @xcite .",
    "in their work , crystal bases were characterized as the sets of semistandard young tableaux with given shapes satisfying certain additional conditions . in @xcite",
    ", littelmann gave another description of crystal bases for finite dimensional simple lie algebras using the lakshmibai - seshadri monomial theory .",
    "his approach was generalized to the _ path model theory _ for all symmetrizable kac - moody algebras @xcite .",
    "littelmann s theory also gives rise to colored oriented graphs , which turned out to be isomorphic to the crystal graphs @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , nakashima gave a generalization of the littlewood - richardson rule for @xmath3 associated with the classical lie algebras using the crystal base theory .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , young wall , an affine combinatorial object , was introduced .",

    ", we give a new realization of crystal bases for finite dimensional irreducible modules over classical lie algebras derived from the young wall realization .",
    "the basis vector is parameterized by certain tableaux with given shape which is different from generalized young diagram given by kashiwara and nakashima . moreover , motivated by the fact that the tableau realization of @xmath21 given by kashiwara and nakashima can be derived from the young wall realization of the crystal graph @xmath21",
    "corresponding to the connected component having the largest number of blocks , we give a crystal isomorphism from our new realization to the realization of kashiwara and nakashima , which will be a part of insertion scheme for the crystal of the classical lie algebras given in @xcite .",
    "the contents of this paper is organized as follows : in section 1 , we review the crystal base theory and the tableaux realization of crystal bases for the classical lie algebras given by kashiwara and nakashima . in section 2 , we recall the notions and properties of young walls and the young wall realization of crystal bases for classical lie algebras given in @xcite . in section 3 ,",
