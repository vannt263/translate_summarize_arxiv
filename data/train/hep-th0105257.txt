    "recently field theories defined on non - commutative spaces have received much attention , mostly triggered by their tight relation with some limiting cases of string theories @xcite .",
    "these field theories are non - local and non - locality has dramatic consequences on their basic dynamical features @xcite : although their ultimate `` physical '' motivation is provided , in our opinion , by their stringy derivation , the possibility of exploring some specific non - local field theories in a concrete , systematic way in search of unexpected properties is fascinating on its own .",
    "non - commutative field theories are explicitly constructed from the conventional ( commutative ) ones by replacing the usual multiplication of fields in the lagrangian with the @xmath2-product of fields .",
    "the @xmath2-product is obtained by introducing a real antisymmetric matrix @xmath3 which parametrizes non - commutativity of minkowski space - time : = i^,=0, .. ,d-1 .",
    "the @xmath2-product of two fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 is defined as [ star ]",
    "_ 1(x)_2(x)=[2 ^ ] _ 1(x_1)_2(x_2)|_x_1=x_2=x and leads to terms in the action with an infinite number of derivatives of fields which makes the theory non - local",
    ". then one may wonder under which conditions the theory would still fulfill the unitarity requirements .",
    "unitarity is of course a central issue for the correct physical interpretation of a quantum field theory : as is well known , it is granted once the time evolution of a system in a hilbert space is driven by a self - adjoint operator , its hamiltonian . in the ordinary case the problem becomes subtle when gauge theories are concerned : the norm in the full fock space is not positive definite , ghosts propagate as virtual states in physical processes and unitarity is formally recovered at the level of the @xmath6-matrix looking at transition amplitudes between physical states ( selected by the brst condition ) . in quantum non - commutative gauge theories , where non - locality mingles with the presence of unphysical states and with the poor definition of @xmath6-matrix elements , the investigation of unitarity becomes particularly challenging .",
    "unitarity of scalar field theories , in the presence of non - commutativity , has been discussed , in a perturbative framework , in ref .",
    "@xcite : the authors explicitly show that cutkoski s rules are correct when @xmath3 is of the `` spatial '' type , @xmath7 .",
    "this exactly corresponds to the case in which an elegant embedding into string theory is possible : low - energy excitations of a @xmath8-brane in a magnetic background are in fact described by field theories with space non - commutativity @xcite . in this",
    "limit the relevant description of the dynamics is in terms of massless open string states , while massive open string states and closed strings decouple : therefore the full unitary string theory seems consistently truncated to field - theoretical degrees of freedom , suggesting the possibility that also related quantum field theories are unitary .",
    "the picture is consistent even at string - loop level as shown in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand theories with @xmath9 have an infinite number of time derivatives and are non - local in time : in this situation it is not clear whether the usual framework of quantum mechanics makes sense , in particular unitarity may be in jeopardy when the non - commutative parameter @xmath3 affects the time evolution , the concept of hamiltonian losing , in some sense , its meaning ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "this fact is not surprising when observed from the string theory point of view : @xmath9 is obtained in the presence of an electric background and recent works @xcite have pointed out that in the relevant low - energy limit massive open string states do not decouple while closed strings do .",
    "the truncation of such a string theory to its massless sector is not consistent in this case ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we derive the complete one - loop result in general @xmath11 dimensions , using feynman gauge .",
    "going to @xmath12 we recover the well - known fact that only planar diagrams are uv - divergent while the non - planar part depends separately on two different kinematical variables , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "from the point of view of the dispersion relations the situation is clear in the non - commutative spatial case : the vector @xmath15 is spacelike and there is no point in analytically continuing the variable @xmath16 .",
    "we have to deal with normal dispersion relations in @xmath17 with the obvious presence of an extra kinematical variable .",
    "the situation is much trickier when non - commutativity involves time .",
    "then @xmath15 can also be timelike and it is not clear _ a priori _ which variable should be analytically continued . the natural choice would be @xmath0 in this case , also in view of the fact that the lorentz invariance is broken in such theories .",
    "however , even with this choice , cutkoski s rules are still invalid , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalar case ; the presence of extra troublesome singularities in the @xmath0-plane , while being an obvious sign of instability of the theory , can hardly be explained in a perturbative context . moreover , both in the spatial and in the space - time non - commutative cases , new poles appear in the one - loop resummed vector propagator for negative values of @xmath17 ( tachyons ) .",

    "we quantize the theory in the feynman-t hooft gauge and , in order to check unitarity and gauge invariance at the quantum level , we consider the one - loop correction to the gluon self energy .",
    "one - loop diagrams contributing to the two - point function are shown in fig .  1 .    in the ordinary gauge theories ,",

    "we have checked that indeed the cutting rules hold also in this non - commutative context , provided the non - commutative parameter @xmath49 has only spatial components .",
    "this claim has already been presented for the scalar theory in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the stringy context",
    ", this picture has its counterpart in the decoupling of massive open and closed string states in the presence of a magnetic background .",
    "the analytic properties outlined above are necessary requirements for fulfilling unitarity ; next , positivity conditions , crucial for the correct probabilistic interpretation of the theory , are to be met .",
    "when saturating the tensor with a ( spacelike ) polarization vector @xmath50 and computing its discontinuity afterwards , a non - negative result is expected since , in the one - loop case we are considering , positivity can not be spoilt by the extra phases affecting the vertices .",

    "however in the non - commutative case novel features arise : in fact , in eq .",
    "the asymptotic value 5/3 of the planar contribution is reached after wiggling : this feature , which is present also in scalar theories @xcite , reminds of analogous quantum mechanical effects ( diffraction and interference ) and is a consequence of the non - commutativity of coordinates , which in turn entails a violation of locality and of lorentz invariance .",
    "the vanishing of the discontinuity at @xmath47 can be understood as a threshold effect ; nonetheless , @xmath52 can also mean @xmath59 .",
    "the behaviour of the theory in this limit looks peculiar and will be discussed later on .",
    "suffice it here to say that in the reference frame and in the approximation we are considering , no production occurs in the plane @xmath59 .",
    "this @xmath60 phase of the theory is a novel feature compared to the commuting case . on the other hand @xmath54 itself is singular in such a limit and can not be cured .    in general non - local theories",
    "lead to amplitudes which are not polynomially bounded at infinity on the first riemann sheet ; this issue stands at the very heart of a renormalization program and deserves thorough investigations .    in view of the non - locality of the theory , one might wonder whether amplitudes can still be reconstructed from their imaginary parts via dispersion relations . in the instances we are considering",
    "the answer is affirmative , but to a certain extent .",
    "the discontinuity @xmath61 is constant and therefore @xmath62 needs to be subtracted once , as is well - known ; @xmath63 vanishes at infinity and no subtraction is _ a priori _ needed .",
    "the situation with @xmath44 is subtler and somehow pathological .",
    "in commutative theories subtraction constants in dispersion relations are related to the presence of singularities in feynman amplitudes .",
    "the arbitrariness of such constants is in turn related to different renormalization prescription .",
    "thus , increasing discontinuities usually correspond to divergent amplitudes .",
    "this is not always the case in non - commutative theories ; as a matter of fact the absolute value of @xmath64 increases at infinity in four dimensions . as a consequence the dispersion relation needs to be subtracted ( once ) .",
    "nevertheless we know from feynman diagram calculations that @xmath44 is finite when @xmath65 and therefore the subtraction constant turns out to be completely determined .",
    "one could consider the dispersion relation starting from the discontinuity in @xmath66 dimensions ; then , for suitable values of @xmath67 , no subtraction is necessary and , at variance with the usual case , no pole occurs in the continuation to @xmath65 .",
    "however this procedure is somehow extraneous to the spirit of a dispersive approach , being possible only in a perturbative context where amplitudes can be directly computed anyway .    in recovering eqs .",

    "we now comment on the infrared singularities , namely the ones at small @xmath71 , affecting @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as is well known , they are the counterparts of the would - be ultraviolet singularities in the absence of the non - commutative phase .",
    "although quite clear from a mathematical viewpoint , their presence is particularly troublesome in higher order calculations where the momentum @xmath72 has to be integrated over . for a proposal of using wilsonian methods to tame infrared singularities and to prove uv renormalizability , in the scalar case , see @xcite .",
    "if we recall the dyson equation for the renormalized vector propagator [ dyson ] ( d_^(ren))^-1=(d_^(0))^-1-_^(ren ) , where @xmath73 is the free propagator , it is clear that infrared divergences of @xmath74 can not affect @xmath75 .",
    "although certainly appearing order by order in the perturbative expansion , they might be artifact of this expansion . on the other hand at two loops and beyond , infrared divergencies other than iterated one - loop ones , may be generated and their explicit form has to be taken into account in order to draw conclusions on the finiteness of @xmath76 at small @xmath77 .",

    "we derived such an expression by first rescaling the variables @xmath19 , @xmath133 , @xmath121 , @xmath134 and then neglecting terms like @xmath135 , @xmath136 with respect to @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .    our goal is to prove that eq",

    "similarly one can treat integrals arising from graphs in figs .",
    "4(b ) , ( c ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath131 comes from `` spider '' diagrams , namely those containing the triple vector vertex .",
    "it can be straightforwardly checked that spider diagrams are at most @xmath144 . by denoting by @xmath145 the contribution of the diagram in which the vectors are attached to the lines @xmath122 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , respectively , one has for instance ( see fig .",

    "we now turn to the calculation of @xmath132 in the large-@xmath22 limit , namely of the diagrams with a single vector exchange and a self - energy correction @xmath150 ( `` bubble '' diagrams ) .",
    "we indicate with @xmath151 the diagram in which the propagator , given by eqs .  - , connects the sides @xmath122 , @xmath146 . among all @xmath151 s , in the limit @xmath152 ,",
    "leading contributions are produced by @xmath153 and @xmath154 ; however they turn out to be only @xmath155 .",

    "nonetheless there are subtleties due to the fact that the planar part of the self - energy is uv divergent ; henceforth , when inserted in the wilson loop , the latter needs being regularized .",
    "the same problem clearly occurs also in the ordinary case and is usually dealt with by considering the analytic continuation of the self - energy in the complex @xmath67-plane and by performing the limit @xmath152 while keeping @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "once this point has been made clear , @xmath157 reads [ bubble ] b_33= _",
    "-t^t dx _ x^t dy e^i p_0 ( x - y )",
    "( p^2-p_0 ^ 2 ) _ 1 . after integrating out @xmath19 and @xmath133",
    ", one can show that , in the large-@xmath22 limit , @xmath157 does not increase faster than @xmath22 .    in the same philosophy of ref .",
    "@xcite , such a contribution , divergent as @xmath158 but subleading in @xmath22 , is discarded .",
    "the same large-@xmath22 behaviour is exhibited by @xmath154 , the only essential difference being the phase factor @xmath159 , independent of the geometrical variables , in the integrand .    with the choice of non - commutative parameter we have hitherto considered ( @xmath160 ) , the peculiar extra structure encoded in @xmath44 has not been probed .",
    "a more intriguing situation occurs if we scrutinize the case @xmath161 . in this case",
    "the uv - ir mixing phenomenon , typical of a non - commutative theory , affects the @xmath162 loop calculation . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath44 diverges as @xmath163 in the ir , which is the counterpart of the would - be quadratic mass singularity coming from a tadpole . if we again adopt the philosophy of keeping @xmath156 , the singularity is not exposed and we recover a sub - leading behaviour in the large @xmath22-limit .",
    "however , there is an additional problem with respect to the previous case , in as much as we have to invoke continuation in @xmath67 in order to regularize both the uv and the ir behaviours .",
    "one could assume a different attitude , namely consider a one - loop resummed vector propagator , according to eq .",
    ", keeping the dependence on the renormalization procedure , which should hopefully be irrelevant to the final result",
    ". then , of course , ir singularities get sterilized ; nonetheless , this choice should be consistently performed in all the diagrams we have considered and would imply an infinite partial resummation of perturbative diagrams , leading thereby to a result beyond @xmath162 .",
    "in addition , one would face the troublesome problem of the appearance of the tachyonic pole we have described in the previous section , whose extra contribution could hardly be interpreted .    as a final remark",
    ", we stress that our treatment of the wilson loop applies to a non - commutative theory of a `` magnetic '' type . in the `` electric '' case , leaving aside the difficulties related to the interpretation of such a wilson loop in this situation , its large-@xmath22 behaviour involves the non - commutative parameter via the moyal phase .",
    "not only one encounters considerable technical difficulties in performing such a computation , but also different scaling limits lead to different outcomes and all of them still call for a sensible explanation .",
    "we discussed the quantum consistency of non - commutative gauge theories by investigating their unitarity properties at perturbative level . in the first part of the paper we extended the work of @xcite to gauge theories , studying the one - loop level analytical structure of the vacuum polarization tensor both for pure spatial ( magnetic ) and space - time ( electric ) non - commutative parameter .",
    "the general feature is a violation of lorentz covariance through the appearance in the amplitudes of a new kinematical variable @xmath164 ; dispersion relations are strongly affected by its presence . in the magnetic case we found that cutkoski s rules are satisfied by considering only physical branch cuts : the positivity of spectral densities related to transverse polarizations is checked , although being realized through an oscillating behaviour , and the possibility of recovering the full feynman amplitude through its imaginary part , in spite of the non - locality of the theory , was carefully discussed . on the other hand , in the electric case we saw the appearance of extra singularities on the @xmath0-plane :",
    "a threshold starting at @xmath165 , with a non - positive definite discontinuity , suggests the presence of tachyonic excitations carrying negative probabilities .",
    "perturbative unitarity is therefore lost .",
    "next , by resumming the one - loop result , new poles for physical polarizations come into play : it is well known @xcite that , thanks to the ir / uv mixing , it is possible to obtain isolate poles , for energy well below the ( usual ) landau singularity , for small momenta . in the pure spatial case",
    "a tachyon is found with positive probability , signalling , anyway , a perturbative instability . for a space - time",
    "non - commutative parameter the situation is much more exotic : two tachyonic poles appear for @xmath166 at perturbative ( @xmath150 ) momenta , with different positivity properties .",
    "the ghostly one decouples as @xmath167 while the other is turned , in the same limit , into a correction of the free pole . above a certain value of the coupling",
    "both poles migrate into the complex plane .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we proposed an extension of the usual test of time exponentiation of a wilson loop to the non - commutative gauge theories : the definition of the loop through non - commutative path - ordering makes its physical interpretation not straightforward even in the pure spatial case .",
    "we nevertheless showed in the magnetic case that exponentiation persists at @xmath162 , in spite of the presence of moyal phases and of the appearance of new infrared singularities .",
    "the approximations we employed in the computation are likely to be justified in the spatial case while for space - time non - commutativity they are likely to be invalid , posing a difficulty of principle to the investigation .",
    "our results fit well with the common wisdom derived from the stringy picture , relating the magnetic case to a good field theoretical limit ; the non - unitarity of the electric case has to be ascribed , instead , to the impossibility of decoupling massive open - string states from the light degrees of freedom .",
    "many questions remain , nevertheless , to be answered .",
    "the first one concerns the presence of a tachyonic pole in the `` magnetic '' theory , that seems to signal an instability of the perturbative vacuum .",
    "it would be very interesting to study its effect on the four - point function , where unitarity poses strong constraints through the presence of crossed channels .",
    "the very same singularity seems to be an obstacle for the renormalizability program : in particular the recent proposal @xcite to define an ir safe perturbation theory through resummation appears in conflict with the presence of a tachyonic pole .",
    "a more careful investigation of the vacuum properties of non - commutative gauge theories is probably needed . on the other hand",
    "it would be important to better understand if the wilson loop test is fully justified in the non - commutative context .",
    "wilson lines have a natural interpretation when coming from string theory @xcite , and therefore their relation with unitarity is likely to be simpler in that context .",
    "all these issues are currently under investigations .",
    "the non - commutative yang - mills action in the t hooft - feynman gauge including ghosts takes the following form s= d^4 x   ( -12 g^2 f^ f _ + ( ^a _ ) ^2 - |c ^d_c + ^d_c |c ) . in the feynman-t hooft gauge , the feynman rules are          & & + & & 2 g ( -i ( 2 ) t^c + ( 2 ) \\{t^a , t^b}t^c ) + & & [ ( k - p)^g^ + ( p - q)^g^ + ( q - k)^g^ ] + & & + & & + & & -2ig^2 + & & -2ig^2 ( g^ g^ - g^ g^)+ ( 1324)+(1423 ) + & & + & & + & & -2 g q^(-i ( 2 ) t^c + ( 2 ) \\{t^a , t^b}t^c ) , + & & + & & where wavy and dotted lines denote gluons and ghosts , respectively , capital letters @xmath25 indices , small letters momenta .",
    "finally we set @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
