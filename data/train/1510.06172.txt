    "a simpler and mathematically more tractable discretization of the long - studied hard - sphere fluid in continuum space is called `` hard - sphere lattice gas '' ( hslg ) with nearest - neighbor exclusion@xcite . in this model",
    "the sites of a regular lattice are the only allowed positions of the constituents .",
    "the pair interaction potential is @xmath1 for constituents centered on nearest - neighbor sites and vanishes otherwise .",
    "double occupancy of sites is forbidden .",
    "in particular in @xmath2 , on a square ( @xmath3 ) lattice , the spheres of the model can be viewed as `` hard - squares '' oriented at @xmath4 with respect to the lattice axes and whose diagonals equal two lattice spacings . in @xmath5 the spheres are effectively `` hard octaedra '' and analogously for higher - dimensional lattices , they are polytopes ( i.e. convex hyper - polyhedra ) whose vertices are the nearest neighbors of the sites on which they are centered .",
    "if the properties of the hslg on a finite lattice are described by the statistical mechanics formalism of the grand partition function , it turns out that the @xmath6th coefficient of the low - activity(la ) series - expansion of the grand - potential has the same combinatorial definition@xcite as the coefficient of the highest power of the temperature - like variable @xmath7 in the @xmath6th low - temperature ( lt ) polynomial of a ferromagnetic ising model with spin @xmath8 on the same lattice .",
    "this relationship remains valid when the thermodynamic limit is taken .",
    "when this fact was recognized , it became trivial to write down the la expansions of the pressure once the lt expansion of the ising model on the same lattice , in presence of a magnetic field , is known .",
    "thus , for the one - dimensional lattice , one can write a la expansion valid to all orders . for the @xmath3 lattice ,",
    "initially the la expansion could be obtained@xcite in this way only through the 12th order .",
    "the derivation was later extended@xcite through the 21st order .",
    "finally , by a more powerful approach based on the corner - transfer - matrix method@xcite , the la series was pushed through the 42nd order and more recently@xcite through the 92nd order .    for the triangular lattice ( `` _ hard - hexagon _ '' model ) , an exact solution@xcite of the hslg model was devised .",
    "it is expected@xcite that also the honeycomb ( @xmath9 ) lattice case ( called the `` _ hard - triangle _ '' model ) is soluble , however , presently we know only a a 25th order la expansion derived from the lt ising expansion@xcite for the @xmath9 lattice . for lattices of dimension",
    "@xmath10 , the transfer - matrix techniques are not efficient , so that one has to rely only on the lt ising expansions and no la data of extension comparable with that of the @xmath3 lattice can be derived . in the case of the three - dimensional hydrogen - peroxide ( @xmath11 ) lattice , a bipartite cubic lattice of coordination number 3 , the known ising lt series@xcite yields a 23rd order la series for the hslg model .",
    "for the three - dimensional bipartite @xmath12 lattice , with coordination number 4 , the first 17 la coefficients can be obtained@xcite .",
    "only the first 15 ising lt polynomials are presently known@xcite for the simple - cubic ( @xmath13 ) lattice in @xmath5 and the hyper - simple - cubic ( @xmath14 ) in @xmath15 , while the first 11 polynomials@xcite are known in the case of the body - centered - cubic ( @xmath16 ) lattice .",
    "no lt data at all existed up to now for the @xmath14 and the hyper - body - centered - cubic ( @xmath17 ) lattices of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "we have recently calculated@xcite the ising lt polynomials for all @xmath14 lattices in general dimension @xmath0 through the 13th order . as a result , in this paper we can present the la and low - density ( ld ) expansions for the hslg through the same order , having observed that the ld expansion coefficients @xmath19 of the pressure are polynomials of degree @xmath20 $ ] in @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noticing that also the ld expansion coefficients of the pressure for the dimer model on the @xmath14 lattices share a similar ( slow ) polynomial dependence on @xmath0 , making it possible to determine@xcite the ld expansions through the 20th order .",
    "we shall analyze the la expansions for the hslg to extract information about the properties of the model for @xmath18 , which , up to now , have been the subject of a single accurate montecarlo(mc ) study@xcite . to support some of the indications suggested from our study for the higher - dimensional lattices , we shall also perform an analysis of the la and the ld series for the @xmath9 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 lattices , to which little attention was devoted in the literature .",
    "it is also well known that , using the standard correspondence@xcite between the lattice gas and the spin-1/2 ising model , one can relate the hslg with an lt anti - ferromagnetic ising spin system subject to a magnetic field@xcite on the same lattice and thus further insight can come also from this standpoint . in particular , in analogy with the la series , the high - activity ( ha ) expansions coefficients ( in powers of @xmath21 ) for the pressure can be directly read@xcite from the ising lt anti - ferromagnetic polynomials .",
    "unfortunately , the lt anti - ferromagnetic data are scarce and therefore direct methods@xcite have been necessary to compute the ha series@xcite , presently known only through order 23 for the @xmath3 lattice , and through the 16th or the 19th orders , respectively for the simple - cubic ( @xmath13 ) and the body - centered - cubic ( @xmath16 ) lattices .",
    "no such series exist for the lattices with @xmath18 , with which we shall be mainly concerned in this paper .    for the hslg model one",
    "is mainly interested into    _ a ) _ the leading _ nonphysical _ singularity@xcite of the pressure located at a small negative value of the activity .",
    "its exponent is known to be simply related to that of the universal @xcite yang - lee edge - singularity for spin systems of the same dimension , as well as to the exponents of several other systems@xcite , such as the directed branched polymers , the undirected site or bond animals etc ..    _ b ) _ the parameters of the expected _ physical _ phase - transition which takes place as the density increases and changes the ld disordered phase into an hd ordered one . in this transition , associated with the nearest singularity of the pressure on the positive activity ( or density ) axis and accurately checked@xcite to be ising - like for the bipartite lattices ( to which we shall restrict this study ) , one of the two equivalent sublattices becomes preferentially occupied at hd , while at ld ( or equivalently at la ) , the constituents are uniformly distributed all over the lattice sites .",
    "we may also remark@xcite that the transition is `` entropy - driven '' , because the internal energy vanishes for the allowed configurations of the system and the temperature turns out to be an irrelevant constant , so that the free energy coincides up to a sign with the entropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we recall the structure of the lt expansion for a ferromagnetic spin 1/2 ising model and write down the corresponding la and ld expansions of the pressure for the hslg .",
    "the analysis of these expansions for lattices of various dimensions , leads to a conjecture on the nature of the nearest singularity in the complex density plane for @xmath22 , and is presented in section iii .",
    "simple estimates of the entropy constants for lattices of not too high @xmath0 are discussed in section iv .",
    "the last section contains a summary of our results .",
    "the appendix a0 reviews in some detail our derivation of the lt polynomials of the spin 1/2 ising model subject to a magnetic field , from the corresponding ht expansion .    in the appendix a1",
    ", we argue that the virial expansion coefficients @xmath19 can be expressed as polynomials in @xmath0 of degree @xmath20 $ ] and present handy expressions of the la and the ld expansions of the pressure valid for @xmath14 lattices of general dimension .",
    "on a finite @xmath0-dimensional lattice of @xmath23 sites ( we set the lattice spacing @xmath24 ) , the spin-@xmath25 ferromagnetic ising model in an external magnetic field @xmath26 , is described by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the spin variable at the site @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the exchange energy and @xmath31 ( set equal to one in what follows ) is the magnetic moment of a spin .",
    "the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ isiesse ] ) extends over all distinct nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , the second sum over all lattice sites .",
    "if we set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the boltzmann constant and @xmath35 the temperature , while @xmath36 denotes the reduced magnetic field , then in the lt and high - field limit , we can write the free energy per site @xmath37 as @xmath38 here @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , and @xmath41 is the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "the series - expansion coefficients of the free energy in powers of @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 , are polynomials in the variable @xmath7 .    we have recently derived ( or , in some cases , extended ) the lt expansions of the specific free - energy for the spin-@xmath44 ising models , on @xmath14 and @xmath16 lattices of arbitrary dimension @xmath0 in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "our additional results were not obtained by extending the direct graphical calculation , but more simply from our high - temperature ( ht ) expansions@xcite , by performing on these an appropriate transformation to the lt and high - field variables . in particular , we have derived 13th order lt expansions on the @xmath14 lattice of general dimension @xmath0 , for @xmath8 .    as anticipated in the introduction , the knowledge of these expansions yields immediately@xcite the coefficients of the la ( ld ) expansion for the grand - potential of the hslg on the same lattices .    for convenience ,",
    "let us now state a few standard definitions from the statistical mechanics description of the hslg model .",
    "due to the nearest - neighbor exclusion interaction , the @xmath45-th coefficient @xmath46 of the la expansion of the grand partition - function @xmath47 for a @xmath23-site lattice simply counts the allowed configurations of @xmath45 hard spheres . in the absence of non - hard - core interactions and",
    "thus of an energy scale for the system , the statistical mechanics is temperature independent , i.e. the system is `` athermal '' , and one can simply set @xmath48 .",
    "the first three coefficients of the la expansion of @xmath47 depend on the lattice structure and size @xmath23 as simply as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath42 is the chemical potential .",
    "it is worth noting that the coefficients @xmath51 enumerate the `` independent sets '' of @xmath45 vertices in the @xmath23-vertex graph induced by the ( finite ) lattice under study .",
    "thus , in combinatorial language @xmath47 is the `` independent - set generating polynomial '' of the lattice .",
    "computing these quantities for general graphs has been a much studied problem in combinatorial mathematics@xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit , the coefficients of the la expansion@xcite of the `` grand - potential '' ( or `` pressure '' ) per site @xmath52",
    "are formally obtained by picking out the coefficients of the terms linear in @xmath23 in the expansion of @xmath53 . in the same limit",

    "the virial expansion of the pressure ( ld expansion ) is then obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) to express the activity @xmath58 as function of @xmath56 and substituting it in @xmath59 @xmath60 the compressibility @xmath61 defined as @xmath62 and the specific entropy @xmath63 are also of interest .",
    "note that @xmath44 vanishes not only as @xmath64 , but also as @xmath65 , so that there is no residual entropy at maximum density , since for the bipartite lattices , independently of their structure , the first terms of the ha expansion@xcite for the pressure and the density are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .    in the case of the @xmath14 lattices",
    ", the coefficients @xmath68(d)$ ] of the various powers of @xmath7 in the lt polynomials @xmath43 can be represented as simple polynomials in @xmath0 .",
    "this property of the lt polynomials reflects the analogous property@xcite of the ht expansion of the ising model for this class of lattices . in the appendix a1 , we have discussed why it is so .",
    "correspondingly , we can write simple exact expressions , valid for any @xmath0 , of each coefficient in the la and in the ld expansions of the pressure .",
    "these general @xmath0 expansions for the @xmath14 lattices , that we regard as the main result of this paper in spite of their still moderate length , are reported in the appendix a1 .",

    ", the free - energy of the ising model in a field can be computed to all orders yielding exact expressions for the la expansion of the hslg model : @xmath69 and for the virial expansion @xmath70",
    "let us now observe that the la expansions of the pressure are well suited to estimate numerically the nearest singularity @xmath71 in the plane of the complex activity @xmath58 , which lies on the real negative axis and thus is _ nonphysical _ , but controls the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients and therefore the convergence radius of the la expansion . in @xmath0 dimensions",
