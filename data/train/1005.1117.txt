    "a principal focus in wireless network research today is on mobile ad hoc networks , in which nodes moving in space cooperate to relay packets on behalf of other nodes without any centralized infrastructure . although the _",
    "static _ properties of such networks are by now quite well understood mathematically , the additional challenges posed by node mobility have so far received relatively little attention from the theory community . in this paper",
    "we consider a mathematical model for mobile wireless networks , which we call _ mobile geometric graphs _ and which is a natural extension of the widely studied _ random geometric graphs _",
    "model of static networks .",
    "we study two fundamental problems in this model : the _ detection _ problem ( time until a fixed or moving target is detected by the network ) , and the _ percolation _ problem ( time until a given node is able to communicate with many other nodes ) .    in the random geometric graph ( rgg )",
    "model  @xcite , nodes are distributed in a region @xmath7 according to a poisson point process of intensity  @xmath8 ( i.e. , the number of nodes in any subregion @xmath9 is poisson with mean  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the volume of  @xmath12 ) .",
    "two nodes are connected by an edge iff their distance is at most  @xmath13 , where the parameter  @xmath13 is the _ transmission range _ that specifies the distance over which nodes may send and receive information ; since the structure of the rgg depends only on the product @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the radius-@xmath13 ball in  @xmath16 )  @xcite , we may fix  @xmath13 so that @xmath17 and parameterize the model on  @xmath8 only .",
    "we shall take @xmath18 to be a cube of volume  @xmath19 ( so that the expected number of nodes in  @xmath18 is  @xmath5 ) , and consider the limiting behavior as @xmath20 .    clearly , increasing @xmath8 increases the average degree of the nodes .",
    "as is well known , there are two critical values of  @xmath8 at which the connectivity properties of the rgg undergo a significant change .",
    "first there is the _ percolation threshold _",
    "@xmath21 ( a constant that depends on the dimension  @xmath22 ) , so that if @xmath23 the network w.h.p .. '' ]  has a unique `` giant '' component containing a constant fraction of the nodes , while if @xmath24 all components have size @xmath25 w.h.p .",
    "second , at the _ connectivity threshold _ @xmath26 , the network becomes connected w.h.p .",
    "the percolation threshold @xmath21 occurs also in the infinite - volume limit where @xmath27 , in which case the giant component is the unique infinite component ( or  infinite cluster \" ) with probability  1 .",
    "these and other fundamental properties of rggs are extensively discussed in the book of penrose  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for additional results on thresholds .",
    "there are a host of theoretical results on routing and other algorithmic questions on static rggs ( see the related work section below for a partial list ) .",
    "naturally , most of these consider networks above the connectivity threshold .",
    "a central feature of many ad hoc networks is the fact that the nodes are moving in space .",
    "this is the case , for example , in vehicular networks ( where sensors are attached to cars , buses or taxis ) , surveillance and disaster recovery applications where mobile sensors are used to survey an area , and pocket - switched networks based on mobile communication devices such as cellphones .",
    "such networks are also frequently modeled using rggs , augmented by motion of the nodes .",
    "we will employ the following model , which we refer to as _ mobile geometric graphs _ ( mggs ) and which is essentially equivalent to the  dynamic boolean model \" introduced in  @xcite in the context of dynamic continuum percolation .",
    "we begin at time  0 with a ( infinite ) below . ]",
    "rgg  @xmath28 in @xmath27 .",
    "nodes move independently in continuous time according to brownian motion with variance  @xmath29 ; here @xmath30 is a _ range of motion _",
    "parameter , which we assume is constant to ensure a realistic model .",
    "we observe the nodes at discrete time steps ( so the displacement of a node in each direction in each time step is normally distributed with mean  0 and variance  @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is not hard to verify that this produces a markovian sequence of rggs @xmath31 , all with the same value of  @xmath8 .",
    "note that , while each @xmath32 is a rgg , there are correlations over time ; it is this feature that makes mobility challenging to analyze .",
    "once mobility is injected , the questions of interest naturally change from those in the static case .",
    "for example , connectivity no longer plays such a central role because mobility may allow nodes @xmath33 to exchange messages even in the absence of a path between them at any given time : namely , @xmath34 can route its message to  @xmath35 along a time - dependent path , opportunistically using other nodes to relay the message towards  @xmath35 . networks of this kind are often termed `` delay tolerant networks ''  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to focus not on the rather artificial connectivity regime ( where @xmath8 grows with  @xmath5 ) , but instead on the case where  @xmath8 ( and hence the average degree ) is constant .",
    "keeping @xmath8 constant is obviously highly desirable as it makes the model much more realistic and scalable .",
    "there are rather few rigorous results on wireless networks with mobile nodes , and those that do exist typically either make unrealistic assumptions about node mobility ( such as unbounded range of motion  @xcite or no change in direction  @xcite ) , or work in the connectivity regime which , as we have seen , requires unbounded density or transmission range  @xcite .",
    "( see the related work section for more details . ) in this paper we study two fundamental questions for mobile networks assuming only constant average degree and bounded range of motion ( i.e. , constant values of the parameters @xmath8 and  @xmath30 ) .",
    "* detection .",
    "*   a central issue in surveillance and remote sensing applications is the ability of the network to detect a `` target '' @xmath36 ( which may be either fixed or moving ) , in the sense that there is a node within distance at most  @xmath13 of  @xmath34 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that , for a static rgg , a fixed target can be detected only with constant probability unless the average degree grows with  @xmath5 . in the mobile case , we may hope to achieve detection _ over time _ with constant average degree ( @xmath37 , even _",
    "below _ the percolation threshold ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the detection time , @xmath38 , is formulated as the number of steps until a target initially at the origin is detected by the mgg .",
    "recent work of liu et al .",
    "@xcite shows that the detection time in two dimensions is exponentially distributed when the nodes of the network move in _ fixed _ directions . in the more realistic mgg model , we are able to prove the following result which holds in all dimensions ( see section  [ sec : detection ] ) :    [ thm : detection ] in the mgg model with any fixed  @xmath8 and range of motion  @xmath39 , the detection time for a fixed target or a target moving under brownian motion satisfies",
    "@xmath40 } = \\exp\\left(-\\theta(t/\\log t)\\right)$ ] for @xmath41 , and @xmath40 } = \\exp\\left(-\\theta(t)\\right)$ ] for @xmath42 .",
    "the constants in the @xmath43 here depend only on @xmath8 , @xmath30 and the dimension  @xmath22 .",
    "thus the tail of the detection time is exponential in three and higher dimensions , and exponential with a logarithmic correction in two dimensions .",
    "we note that , as is evident from the proof , this dichotomy between two and three dimensions reflects the difference between recurrent and transient random walks in  @xmath44 and  @xmath45 respectively .",
    "we also note that the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : detection ] holds for _ arbitrary _ motion of the target ( provided it is independent of the motion of the nodes ) ; and the lower bound holds for any  sufficiently random \" motion of the target .",
    "we should point out that , for the special case of a fixed target , a slightly stronger version of theorem  [ thm : detection ] , with a tight constant in the exponent , follows from classical results on the `` wiener sausage '' in continuum percolation .",
    "( this was pointed out to us by yuval peres  @xcite ; see related work for details . )",
    "however , it is not clear how to extend this approach to the case of a moving target . our proof is elementary and based on an application of the mass transport principle .",
    "* percolation . *",
    "a fundamental question in mobile networks is whether a node can efficiently communicate with other nodes even when the network is not connected at any given time . in the mgg model ,",
    "this question may naturally be formulated by considering a constant intensity @xmath23 ( i.e. , above the percolation threshold ) and asking how long it takes until a node initially at the origin belongs to the giant component ( or the infinite component in the limit @xmath20 ) .",
    "we call this the _ percolation time",
    "_  @xmath46 .",
    "it should be clear that the percolation time can be used to derive bounds on other natural quantities , such as the time for a node to broadcast information to all other nodes ( see corollary  [ cor : broadcast ] below ) .",
    "as far as we are aware the percolation time has not been investigated before , largely because previous work on rggs has focused on networks above the connectivity threshold .",
    "however , it appears to be a fundamental question in the mobile context .",
    "the detection time clearly provides a lower bound on the percolation time , so we may deduce from theorem  [ thm : detection ] above that @xmath47}$ ] is at least @xmath48 for @xmath41 and at least @xmath49 for @xmath42 .",
    "we are able to prove the following stretched exponential upper bound in all dimensions @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : percolation ] ) :    [ thm : percolation ] in the mgg model with any fixed @xmath23 and range of motion @xmath39 , the percolation time for a node at the origin satisfies @xmath47 } = \\exp\\left(-\\omega(t^{d/(d+2)})\\right)$ ] in all dimensions @xmath50 .",
    "again , the constant in the @xmath51 depends only on @xmath8 , @xmath30 and  @xmath22 .",
    "there is a gap between this upper bound and the lower bound from theorem  [ thm : detection ] .",
    "we conjecture that the true tail behavior of  @xmath46 is @xmath52 for @xmath41 and @xmath53 for @xmath42 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : percolation ] is the main technical contribution of the paper ; we briefly mention some of the ideas used in the proof .",
    "the key technical challenge is the dependency of the rggs  @xmath32 over time . to overcome this , we partition  @xmath16 into subregions of suitable size and _ couple _ the evolution of the nodes in each subregion with those of a fresh poisson point process of slightly smaller intensity @xmath54 which is still larger than the critical value  @xmath55 . after a number of steps  @xmath56 that depends on the size of the subregion",
    ", we are able to arrange that the coupled processes match up almost completely . as a result",
    ", we can conclude that our original mgg process , observed every  @xmath56 steps , contains a sequence of _ independent _ poisson point processes with intensity  @xmath57 .",
    "( this fact , which we believe is of wider applicability , is formally stated in proposition  [ pro : coupling ] in section  [ sec : percolation ] . )",
    "this independence is sufficient to complete the proof .",
    "the slack in the bound comes from the  delay \"  @xmath56 .    to illustrate a sample application of theorem  [ thm : percolation ] , we consider the time taken to broadcast a message in a network of finite size .",
    "consider a mgg in a cube of volume  @xmath19 ( so the expected using standard  de - poissonization \" arguments  @xcite .",
    "see the remark following the proof of corollary  [ cor : broadcast ] in section  [ sec : broadcast ] .",
    "] number of nodes is  @xmath5 ) .",
    "since the volume is finite , we need to modify the motion of the nodes to take account of boundary effects : following standard practice , we do this by turning the cube into a torus ( so that nodes  wrap around \" when they reach the boundaries ) .",
    "suppose a message originates at an arbitrary node at time  0 , and at each time step  @xmath0 each node that has already received the message broadcasts it to all nodes in the same connected component .",
    "( here we are making the reasonable assumption that the speed of transmission is much faster than the motion of the nodes , so that messages can travel throughout a connected component before it is altered by the motion . )",
    "let @xmath58 denote the time until all nodes have received the message .",
    "[ cor : broadcast ] in a mgg on the torus of volume  @xmath19 with any fixed @xmath59 and range of motion @xmath39 , the broadcast time @xmath58 is @xmath6 w.h.p .  in any dimension @xmath50 .",
    "there are many theoretical results on routing and other algorithmic questions on ( static ) rggs ; we mention just a few highlights here .",
    "the seminal work of gupta and kumar  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for refinements ) examined the information - theoretic _ capacity _ ( or throughput ) of such networks above the connectivity threshold , i.e. , the number of bits per unit time that each node  @xmath34 can transmit to some ( randomly chosen ) destination node  @xmath60 in steady state , assuming constant size buffers in the network .",
    "the capacity per unit node is @xmath61 , which tends to  0 as @xmath20 , suggesting a fundamental limitation on the scalability of such static networks .",
    "the _ detection _ problem has received much attention . in the static case detection",
    "is essentially equivalent to _ coverage _ of the region  @xmath18 , which requires that the network be connected . in the absence of coverage ,",

    "@xcite prove that , for any @xmath62 , the detection time for a target moving in a fixed direction has an exponential tail .",
    "( note that this is not a mobility result as the nodes are fixed . )",
    "the question of _ broadcasting _ within the giant component of a rgg above the percolation threshold was recently analyzed by bradonji et al .",
    "@xcite , who also show that the graph distance between any two ( sufficiently distant ) nodes is at most a constant factor larger than their euclidean distance .",
    "cover times for random walks on ( connected ) rggs were investigated by avin and ercal  @xcite and cooper and frieze  @xcite , while the effect of physical obstacles that obstruct transmission was studied by frieze et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the scope of mathematically rigorous work on rggs with mobility is much more limited .",
    "we briefly summarize it here .",
    "motivated by the fact mentioned above  @xcite that the capacity of static networks goes to zero as @xmath20 , grossglauser and tse  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) showed how to exploit mobility to achieve constant capacity using a two - hop routing scheme . however , these results require the unrealistic assumption that nodes move a distance comparable to the diameter of the entire region  @xmath18 at each step .",

    "however , this result again assumes that the range of motion of the nodes is unbounded ( i.e. , @xmath30 grows with  @xmath5 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the detection problem was addressed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , assuming that each node moves continuously in a _ fixed _ randomly chosen direction ; they show that the time it takes for the network to detect a target is exponentially distributed with expectation depending on the intensity  @xmath8 .",
    "also , for the special case of a stationary target , as observed in  @xcite a slightly stronger version of theorem  [ thm : detection ] , with tight constants in the exponent , can be deduced from classical results on continuum percolation : namely , in this case it is shown in  @xcite that ( in continuous time ) @xmath63 = \\exp(-\\lambda v_s(t))$ ] , where @xmath64 is the expected volume of the  wiener sausage \" of length  @xmath65 ( essentially the trajectory of a brownian motion  fattened \" by a disk of radius  @xmath13 ) . this volume in turn",
