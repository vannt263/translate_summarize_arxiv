    "although molecular hydrogen is abundant in diffuse and dense regions of the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) , the detailed mechanism of its formation is still not completely clear . at the low gas - phase temperatures typical of the interstellar medium , a gas - phase formation is not possible , and h@xmath0",
    "is therefore formed on the surfaces of grains .",
    "an interpretation of experimental studies @xcite indicates that the surface temperature range over which efficient h@xmath0 formation occurs is very small for olivine ( 6 - 10 k ) and for amorphous carbon ( 13 - 17 k ) @xcite under diffuse - cloud conditions . the grain temperature for midsize grains in unshielded regions is however around 20 k. this means that molecular hydrogen can not be formed efficiently on such grains assuming that the olivine surfaces used in the laboratory are a realistic representation of interstellar grains .",
    "the analysis of @xcite considered , however , only a single barrier for diffusion between binding sites and a single low binding energy between physisorbed h atoms and the surface . in previous papers @xcite",
    ", we showed that the introduction of sites of different binding energy leads to an increase of the temperature range for efficient h@xmath3 formation .",
    "the different sites are the result of a difference in local environment either due to the amorphous character of the grain or to the topological structure of the grain ; i.e. , surface roughness .",
    "these results are in agreement with the findings of @xcite , who introduced extra chemisorption sites and made a distinction between h and d atoms .",
    "they found a larger temperature range depending on the width and the height of the barrier between sites of physisorption and chemisorption .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the formation of molecular hydrogen using similar continuous - time , random - walk monte carlo simulations as in our previous papers @xcite while grains are heated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "the photons hitting a grain give it a short heat impulse , resulting in temperature fluctuations especially for small grains .",
    "these temperature fluctuations have received considerable attention in the literature @xcite , where they are discussed with a varying degree of detail .",
    "while most of the studies simply use the heat capacity to calculate the temperature changes , @xcite looked at the heating and cooling of small silicon clusters and pahs by considering the infrared emission of the grains , taking into account the infrared bands of the grain material .",
    "since our main goal is to study molecular hydrogen formation , we will use a relatively simple model for the heating and cooling . as we will show",
    ", this model is capable of reproducing the detailed method to a large extent .",
    "since both the heating and the recombination of h atoms into h@xmath0 are stochastic processes , the monte carlo technique is an ideal method to study how both processes influence each other . during the simulations ,",
    "the individual h atoms are followed as they land on the grain surface , undergo their random walk , and evaporate .",
    "if two atoms arrive at the same position on the grain , they react to form molecular hydrogen . as these processes occur",
    ", photons are hitting the grain , leading to a pulsed temperature increase and subsequent decrease for the smaller grains . the radiation field and the absorption and emission coefficients used in the simulations",
    "are explained in section [ rad field ] .",
    "the times at which the possible events - hopping , evaporation , and deposition of h atoms , and heating of the grain - occur are randomly determined using the rates of the processes and a random number .",
    "the details of the monte carlo procedure are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarise them in section [ model ] , which also explains the heating and cooling of the grain in more detail .",
    "section [ tempfluc ] contains our results for the fluctuations in temperature , while section [ temp vs eff ] shows their effect on the formation efficiency of h@xmath3 as well as the effects of grain temperature vs. grain size and immediate grain desorption following formation of h@xmath3 .",
    "our results are put into the context of the ism in section [ ism ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the rate of photons absorbed by a grain depends on its position in the cloud and on its optical properties .",
    "we assume the distribution of photons absorbed by the grain per second per wavelength interval as a function of wavelength to be given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 the radius of the grain , @xmath8 the interstellar radiation field in photons per unit area per second per unit wavelength , @xmath9 the wavelength - dependent absorption coefficient , and @xmath10 the reduction factor due to attenuation of the radiation field by dust .",
    "for the interstellar radiation field @xmath8 we use different expressions in different regimes . in the high photon energy regime , with wavelengths 91.2 - 250 nm , the approximation of @xcite is used . the lower photon energy regime , with wavelengths 250 nm-1 cm ,",
    "is divided into four different regions using the expressions from @xcite .    at low photon energies ,",
    "the absorption coefficient , @xmath9 , is approximated using @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the complex refractive index : @xmath13 for the optical constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we used tabulated values for olivine from @xcite . since eq .",
    "( [ qabs ] ) is only valid for @xmath16 we only used this approximation for @xmath9 for @xmath17 nm . for smaller wavelengths ,",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath9 becomes different .",
    "here we used a set of empirical expressions to approximate the absorption coefficients found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they showed the absorption coefficients for silicates and carbonaceous material to be significantly different over a large energy range .",
    "we only used the silicate results here .    for the shielding of the radiation field",
    ", we followed @xcite , who derived the attenuation factor , @xmath10 : @xmath18 based on the attenuation at 1000  .",
    "since we preferred to use @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 we took @xmath21 from @xcite to arrive at the alternative expression @xmath22 we then used the table of @xmath23 values in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure [ dist ] gives the total flux of absorbed photons @xmath24 in photons per second for grains of two different sizes and at different visual extinctions as a function of energy .",
    "the shape of the curves for different grain sizes is the same for low energies because of the constant @xmath25 dependence stemming from the linear dependence of @xmath26 .",
    "this relationship no longer holds in the high energy regime where the curve shapes are different for different grain sizes .",
    "this regime can be divided in two ranges : @xmath24 depends on more than @xmath25 from approximately 1 - 7 ev while the dependency is less strong for energies higher than 7 ev .",
    "the graph further shows that dust attenuation mainly affects the high energy regime .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , we performed our monte carlo simulations of the recombination of hydrogen on different surfaces of varying surface roughness .",
    "these surfaces were generated using a separate monte carlo simulation program starting from a flat surface with a square grid to represent binding sites on a grain .",
    "the resulting surfaces were characterised by a matrix indicating the topological roughness of each lattice grid .",
    "we used four different surfaces : surface ( a ) is completely flat while surfaces ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) have protrusions and  holes  .",
    "in addition , surface ( c ) has several features known as islands and surface ( d ) is very rough with height differences of several monolayers and no distinct shape for the protrusions .",
    "if a hydrogen atom lands on the irregular surface , its local hopping and evaporation energy are calculated based on its number of horizontal ` grain ' neighbours , @xmath27 ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) . for every horizontal neighbour , there is an extra interaction energy @xmath28 .",
    "this method effectively results in surfaces with a maximum of five different binding sites .",
    "the present paper uses the same concept to construct the three surfaces used in the new simulations .",
    "surface i has only one type of site and is therefore flat .",
    "surface ii has a roughness comparable to surface ( c ) in @xcite , but we only distinguish two types of sites .",
    "the first type of site has zero ( @xmath29 ) horizontal neighbours while the second type , which can have one or more horizontal neighbours according to the method used to generate the surface , is still assumed to have only one neighbour ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "surface iii derives from surface ( d ) in @xcite and has five different types of sites , with 0 to 4 horizontal neighbours .",
    "figure [ surf ] shows representations of the non - flat surfaces ii and iii .",
    "note that the colours used in this figure indicate the different sites , in contrast with figure 1 in @xcite where the colour coding is used to indicate the different heights . for surface",
    "ii , the black sites correspond to @xmath29 and the white sites to @xmath30 , whilst for surface iii , the lighter the colour , the greater the number of horizontal neighbours @xmath27 .",
    "the hopping ( @xmath31 ) and evaporation ( @xmath32 ) energies of these sites , labelled by the number of neighbours @xmath27 , are given by @xmath33 @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the energies @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath28 used here for h and h@xmath3 are given in table [ e ] for the different surfaces along with the total number of different sites , @xmath37 and the distribution of these different sites @xmath38 .",
    "the lateral bond , @xmath28 , is chosen to be 40% of the evaporation barrier , @xmath36 .",
    "our previous paper @xcite showed that the recombination efficiency for surface iii is close to unity for temperatures around 20 k. with this choice of the lateral bond , we can distinguish three cases : zero , low , and high efficiency for the surface temperatures of interest in the absence of fluctuations .     and ( bottom )",

    "previous calculations of the rate of molecular hydrogen formation on interstellar grain surfaces in diffuse clouds have ignored the subtle role played by radiation in determining the surface temperature and its fluctuations as functions of grain size . as shown by earlier investigators ( e.g. @xcite ) and confirmed here , the temperature of grains fluctuates strongly for smaller grains ( @xmath40 @xmath2 m ) but not for larger ones , and the modal temperature peaks for grains in the middle range of size ( 0.02 - 0.05 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "we have shown that the efficiency of formation of h@xmath3 depends both on the modal surface temperature and its fluctuations . according to the type of material and its smoothness or roughness , each surface has a range of temperature where the efficiency is high .",
    "for olivine grains , which are considered here , a smooth surface has only a very small range of surface temperature for high efficiency 6 - 9 k - while a very rough surface , with half of its binding sites different from the norm , allows efficient h@xmath3 production up to about 20 k. for small grains , photons pulse the temperature above the range of efficiency , thus reducing it , although the low modal temperature aids h@xmath3 production , especially for flat and moderately rough olivine grains .",
    "the net result for these two types of surfaces is an enhancement in the efficiency for smaller vs. larger grains although the overall efficiency remains low at all sizes .",
    "the relatively high efficiency for small grains is augmented by the high overall surface area given the distribution of grain sizes , so that the production of h@xmath3 is dominated by the smaller grains .",
    "for very rough grains , on the other hand , the efficiency is greater for larger grains since fluctuations are minimal and the modal temperature is still within the range of high efficiency , while it is above this range for smoother surfaces . here",
    "the countervailing larger surface area for smaller grains results in a peak h@xmath3 production for grains of intermediate sizes .",
    "a calculation of the rate coefficient @xmath41 for hydrogen formation in diffuse clouds for which grains from a minimum radius of 0.005 @xmath2 m to a maximum radius of 0.25 @xmath2 m are included shows that in order to equal or exceed the value of @xmath41 deduced by @xcite to reproduce the h@xmath3/h balance in diffuse clouds , one needs a very rough surface of olivine if @xmath42 . at a slightly higher visual extinction of 1.0 ,",
    "flat and moderately rough surfaces lead to values of @xmath41 a factor of six lower than the @xcite value . since the latter visual extinction is quite reasonable for internal portions of diffuse interstellar clouds",
    ", it appears that the rate of formation of h@xmath3 on olivine grains of widely differing topologies can possibly account for the production of this species although the rougher surfaces are better candidates .",
    "this conclusion rests ultimately on the energy needed for evaporation of h atoms deduced by @xcite for an olivine surface ; a somewhat higher value , also consistent with their data , improves the suitability of the smoother surfaces for efficient hydrogen production , especially if the extinction is greater than zero .",
    "if the effects of the radiation field are removed , on the other hand , the difference between the smoother and rougher surfaces remains large .    in our calculations ,",
    "we have only considered grains larger than 5 nm in radius consisting of olivine , and we have only treated a standard radiation field .",
    "the inclusion of smaller silicate particles is an obvious extension , as is the inclusion of carbonaceous grains , which would also allow us to consider much smaller particles , including pahs . for these very small particles , temperature fluctuations will be severe , and strong h atom - surface bonds , known as chemisorption @xcite , must probably be considered to allow h atoms to remain on the grains at the peak temperatures .",
    "it is possible , if barriers to chemisorption are low , that the inclusion of small silicate particles and pahs will increase the calculated values of the rate coefficient @xmath41 for diffuse clouds , and we intend to investigate this effect in the near future . on the other hand , an enhanced radiation field , as associated with photon - dominated regions , will increase the frequency of fluctuations in temperature for small grains , and likely decrease the overall rate of h@xmath3 formation although the effect has yet to be studied .",
