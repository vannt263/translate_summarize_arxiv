    "recently , attention is focused on a possibility that strings are formed at the end of brane inflation  @xcite in the context of braneworld scenarios  @xcite in which our universe might have large extra dimensions .",

    ". one of crucial features of the string in higher - dimensional spacetime is reduction of reconnection probability  @xcite ( and see also ref .",

    "one of the qualitative understanding is that if a string apparently intersects in our visible universe then strings can still avoid intersection in extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "another crucial feature appears in cusp formation , which is a point where string segment reaches the speed of light and its extrinsic curvature diverges .",
    "cusps are formed on closed string loops generically in four - dimensional spacetimes  @xcite .",

    "all possible cohomogeneity - one strings in four - dimensional flat spacetime were completely classified into seven families  @xcite .",
