    "the observed properties of dense cores ( e.g.  benson & myers 1989 ) form the basis of the standard model of isolated star formation . in this model ,",
    "the `` starless '' dense core represents the earliest identifiable stage of the star formation process .",
    "the physical conditions in this early stage have a profound impact on the evolution of protostars towards the main sequence .",
    "the initial density structure , particularly in the innermost regions , affects the collapse dynamics and the time dependence of the mass accretion rate and therefore many of the observable properties of protostars , including luminosity .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the collapse dynamics has been hindered by uncertain knowledge of appropriate initial conditions ( andr , ward - thompson & barsony 2000 ) . in the popular theory of `` inside - out '' collapse ,",
    "a spherical starless core loses turbulent and magnetic support and relaxes to a balance between gravity and thermal pressure , an @xmath7 density distribution is established and the core collapses from the inside - out with a constant mass accretion rate ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "however , if collapse begins before the density distribution fully relaxes , then a central region of relatively constant density remains and the mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude larger at early times ( foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been identified with the youngest `` class  0 ''",
    "protostars , which exhibit especially powerful outflows ( henriksen , andre & bontemps 1997 ; andre , ward - thompson & barsony 2000 ) .",
    "better observations of starless cores are needed to determine the initial conditions .",
    "the l6942 dense core is one of several `` strong '' infall candidates among starless cores , based on observations of molecular line profiles with redshifted self - absorption in a systematic search of more than 200 targets ( lee , myers & tafalla 1999 ) .",
    "molecular line maps of these objects provide strong evidence of inward motions , with speed @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 over a radius of @xmath8  pc ( lee , myers & tafalla 2001 ) . the physical basis for these motions is unclear .",
    "the speeds are subsonic and may be associated with condensation through ambipolar diffusion , or perhaps a magnetically diluted gravitational collapse ( ciolek & basu 2000 ) . alternatively , pressure driven motions due to the dissipation of turbulence may be responsible ( myers & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "observations of dust column density provide a means to infer the structure and dynamical state of a dense core .",
    "harvey et al .  ( 2003b ) describe near - infrared extinction measurements toward l6942 that show a very steep density profile in the region @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( 0.036 to 0.1  pc , or 7500 to 20000  au ) , where background stars were detectable for extinction measurements .",
    "the extinction data can be fit by a number of models that produce nearly degenerate column density profiles , including a simple power law with index @xmath12 , a supercritical bonnor - ebert sphere with dimensionless outer radius @xmath13 , or a nearly end - on isothermal cylinder with scale height @xmath14 .",
    "the latter two models provide a physical description of the core that represents an unstable configuration of material that is consistent with the infalling motions inferred from molecular spectral line profiles",
    ". in particular , the slightly tilted cylindrical model that provides a basis for interpreting the asymmetry of the l6942 core should be highly unstable to gravitational collapse along its axis ( close to the line of sight ) , consistent with the strength and orientation of the observed velocity structure .",
    "the model also provides a framework for understanding the very high extinctions observed in l6942 , namely that the core has prolate structure with the full extent ( mass ) of the core being missed by analysis that assumes symmetry between the profile of the core in the plane of the sky , and the profile of the core along the line - of - sight .",
    "observations of long wavelength dust emission provide another means of probing density structure .",
    "this technique is almost as direct as observations of dust extinction .",
    "the intensity of the optically thin emission provides an integral along the line - of - sight of the product of the density , temperature , and opacity of the dust .",
    "the analysis of dust emission complements dust extinction work because the dust emission method becomes most effective in the high column density inner regions of dense cores where dust extinction becomes large and difficult to penetrate .",
    "much of the detailed information on starless core structure comes from observations of dust emission , using data from bolometer cameras ( e.g. ward - thompson , motte & andre 1999 , shirley et al .",
    "2000 , visser , richer & chandler 2001 ) .",
    "an important conclusion from these studies is that starless cores appear to show flat density profiles in their inner regions , with extended envelopes that fall off rapidly in power law fashion .",
    "recently , the predominance of the flat central density gradients has been called into question as more sophisticated analysis including self - consistent temperature calculations indicate much smaller regions of flattening , or no flattening at all , in large part because the cores are cooler in their deep interiors than assumed previously ( evans et al .",
    "2001 , zucconi et al .",
    "in addition , the central regions of even the nearest protostellar cores are generally comparable in size to the beamwidths of these telescopes and are poorly resolved .",
    "the density structure at smaller scales can be probed with interferometers .",
    "strong constraints can be derived by analyzing interferometer data from dense cores directly in the visibility domain , though this approach has been rarely used ( keene & masson 1990 , hogerheijde et al .  1999 ,",

    "the density distribution of the isothermal cylinder is a two dimensional case of the plummer - like model , with @xmath72 , and with a physical basis for the normalization of the density profile .",
    "a cylindrical model can therefore reproduce the observational properties of pre - stellar cores that provided the motivation for the plummer - like models .",
    "in addition , because the isothermal cylinder and the b - e sphere both represent equilibria between self - gravity and gas pressure , the spherically averaged density profile of an isothermal cylinder can also mimic closely that of a b - e sphere , in particular a flat inner region with a steeply falling envelope ( boss & hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "the cylindrical model also provides a basis for interpreting the departures from spherical symmetry in the l6942 core ( harvey et al .",
    "a slightly tilted , embedded cylinder with scale height @xmath73 reproduces the extinction profile for the inner @xmath11 ( 0.1  pc ) of the core . in the present study we consider isothermal cylinders viewed along the axis , since the subtle effect of a small tilt angle can not be constrained with the visibility dataset .",
    "both plummer - like and isothermal cylinder models can successfully describe the near - ir extinction observations , if the cores are embedded in an extended distribution of gas .",
    "this additional component to the density structure is suggested by the shape of the radial extinction profile , and must be accounted for in the fitting of these types of model .",
    "we include the extended cloud structure in the visibility analysis as follows .",

    "the only effect of the additional structure is to reduce the total flux that is attributable to the core in this context .",
    "the extinction profile of the l6942 core asymptotes to a color - excess that is approximately 0.2 magnitudes higher than the background , and about a tenth ( @xmath74 ) of the color excess at @xmath39 radius ( the edge of the flux normalization aperture ) .",
    "we approximate the intensity profile to be flat within @xmath39 of the core , and assume that the temperature of the extended gas is equal to that in the core , so that the extended structure accounts for 10% of the flux normalization for each of these types of model .",

    "such an approach has been followed by galli , walmsley & gonalves ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , to zeroth order , small departures from isothermality in the kinetic temperature have little effect on the density profile , since the pressure gradient of the gas is dominated by the gradient in the density and not the temperature .",
    "the effect of non - isothermality on the resulting emission profile is therefore dominated by the dust temperature dependence of the planck function .",

    "only the spectral index is of importance , since we assume a constant opacity ( independent of @xmath93 ) , and the overall normalization is fixed by matching the mambo single dish observation .",
    "the spectral index affects the normalization of the models only weakly since the mambo flux constraint is made at a wavelength very close to that of the pdbi and bima observations .",
    "we have adopted @xmath94 ; the extreme alternative of @xmath95 leads to only a 4% change in flux normalization ( for @xmath86  k ) , which is small compared to the overall 10% uncertainty in the normalization itself .",

    "this numerical approach is made necessary by the non - linear nature of the fitting parameters , and is especially useful for this analysis because small variations in the value of the modified @xmath103 as defined above may represent surprisingly large variations in fit quality .",
    "the nature of the visibility dataset , comprising a very large number of very low signal - to - noise measurements , means that even a model with zero signal will on average reproduce each visibility measurement to within its uncertainty .",
    "the resulting shallowness of the @xmath103 wells causes two models with slightly differing parameters to seem almost equally good despite the fact that there is ample signal to distinguish them .",
    "the numerical approach essentially bypasses this complication .",
    "the issue could also be circumvented by binning the visibilities ( e.g.  radially in @xmath34 distance ) , to increase the signal - to - noise , and then performing a @xmath103 fit to the binned values .",
    "we avoid this solution because the visibility profiles for the various models are falling steeply at the baselines of interest , and binning the data inevitably introduces a bias in the fit due to contracting the range of baseline vectors to a single length at the center of the bin .",

    "the pdbi dataset covers baselines from 12 to 80  k@xmath111 , with an overall rms noise of 0.9  mjy .",
    "the visibility data are consistent with the noise .",
    "the long baselines covered by the pdbi data therefore provide an important constraint on the maximum compact component of the flux from the l6942 core , @xmath0  mjy ( 3  @xmath112 ) . for optically thin dust",
    ", this limiting flux corresponds to an implied ( disk ) mass limit of @xmath113  m@xmath114  k@xmath3 for an opacity @xmath115  @xmath116  g@xmath9 .",

    "( 1990 ) , and further demonstrates the `` starless '' nature of the l6942 core .",
    "the flux limit allows an estimate of the maximum bolometric luminosity for any compact component embedded in the l6942 core . for a simple estimate",

    "since the envelope is entirely optically thin at 1.3  mm , the graybody must have a flux that is @xmath124  mjy at this wavelength .",
    "for a given mean dust temperature , this constraint fixes the mass of the compact component .",
    "the only remaining parameter is the radius @xmath125 of the component , which essentially identifies the wavelength at which the emission becomes optically thick .    for a compact component to remain undetected in our pdbi observations",
    "implies that its bolometric luminosity is : @xmath126 note that these power law dependencies are an approximation and are not accurate for changes in the parameters by factors of more than @xmath127 .",
    "the dependences on temperature and radius can be understood in the following way .",
    "the dominant contribution to the luminosity comes from the r - j region of the planck function , in which the emission is optically thin ( for this typical size scale and temperature , the compact component becomes optically thick slightly to the wien side of the peak in the planck function ) .",
    "if the emission from beyond the peak in the planck function is entirely negligible , then the luminsosity is proportional to : @xmath128 .",
    "note that the flux constraint at 1.3  mm causes there to be no temperature dependence in the integrand . using the wien law for @xmath129 , and @xmath130",
    ", then gives @xmath131 .",
    "the contribution of the optically thick emission causes the actual temperature dependence to depart from this relation , and introduces a weak dependence on the radius of the compact source .",
    "the limit the pdbi observations place on the maximum bolometric luminosity of any embedded compact object is substantially lower than the iras limit for l6942 of @xmath132  l@xmath117 .",
    "reprocessing of the warm compact emission to long wavelengths by the envelope essentially allows a large bolometric luminosity to remain hidden below the iras detection limit .",
    "the pdbi data constrains the maximum compact component of dust emission , which allows us to proceed to fit for the envelope structure using the bima data at shorter baselines .",
    "the envelope visibility profiles fall steeply with increasing baseline .",
    "( note that a flatter emission profile leads to a steeper visibility falloff . ) at the longer bima baselines , the visibility amplitudes for the best fit models falls well below the signal - to - noise of the entire bima dataset .",
    "this makes restricting the visibility fitting to the shorter baselines advisable , since extending the fitting range to longer baseline adds noise but no signal . having experimented with various upper limits on the baseline length , we found that an upper limit of 10  k@xmath111 was optimal . increasing the upper limit to 15  k@xmath111 , or 20  k@xmath111",
    "did not change the results but produced higher values of the reduced @xmath103 . the visibility dataset",

    "_ bonnor - ebert sphere._ the model that best fits the visibility data has dimensionless outer radius @xmath133 ( fit  i ) .",
    "at the 2  @xmath112 level this is consistent with the results of the extinction study , where a b - e sphere with @xmath134 reproduced the observed color excess .    _",
    "plummer - like model._ the embedded model that best fits the visibility data has scale radius @xmath135 , or @xmath136  au ( fit  ii ) .",
    "this turn - over radius is consistent with the visser ( 2000 ) analysis of scuba data , which fit a broken power law with a transition to a shallower index within a break radius of @xmath137 ( 8000  au ) .",
    "_ broken power law._ the model that best fits the visibility data has a power law index in the inner region ( @xmath138 ) of @xmath139 ( fit  iii ) .",
    "the turn - over radius used in this model is similar to that from the visser ( 2000 ) analysis , and the fitted inner power law index is consistent with their result of @xmath18 ( no uncertainties are given ) , despite their use of an isothermal dust temperature distribution .",
    "note that the use of a smaller turn - over distance results in a lower fitted value of @xmath66 .",
    "the above result should therefore be construed as a `` mean '' index in the @xmath138 ( 7500  au ) region , or as an upper limit on the power law index in the innermost regions .",
    "_ cylinder._ the end - on cylindrical model that best fits the visibility data has scale height @xmath140 , or @xmath141  au ( fit  iv ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the extinction study , where a slightly tilted cylinder with @xmath14 best matched the observed color excess .    for each of the best fit models ,",
    "the fitted value of the scaling parameter is @xmath142 . that the preferred value is similar for each model and not unity suggests that the data prefer a particular slope of visibility profile that when extrapolated back to zero baseline has 10% lower normalization than the mambo flux .",
    "this difference is well within the combined uncertainties of the mambo flux measurement and the bima calibration accuracy ( total @xmath143% ) .",
    "figure  1 shows plots of visibility amplitude vs.  @xmath34 distance for the various best fit models , and models that differ by @xmath144 in the fitting parameters .",
    "the profiles of the best fit models are remarkably similar , and we return to this point in section  [ sec : disc ] . the mean signal in the bima dataset used to fit the models is shown on the plots ( filled circle ) with @xmath144 error bar .",
    "the binning introduces an uncertainty ( and/or bias ) in the appropriate @xmath34 distance for the data point , that is not present in the model fitting procedure . for each type of model",
    ", we have adopted the @xmath34 distance that provides a match with the best - fit model .",
    "this is motivated by purely graphical reasons , but we note that the mean baseline length weighted by the signal to noise of the best fit model ( for constant noise on each baseline ) provides an essentially indistinguishable @xmath34 coordinate . however , the greater spread of the fitted models compared to the binned data point demonstrates the effect of this `` smearing '' of the signal in @xmath34 distance .",
    "the plots in figure  1 also show @xmath144 confidence intervals of an azimuthally averaged synthetic visibility profile derived from the tafalla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) mambo map of l6942 .",
    "the visibility profiles are computed assuming the mambo map to be the true intensity distribution convolved with a gaussian beam of @xmath145 fwhm .",
    "no assessment has been made for systematic errors in the profile due to chopping and subsequent reconstruction of the mambo observations .",
    "the synthetic confidence intervals are extended until the the signal to noise drops below 2 ( i.e.  the intervals become consistent with zero signal ) .      table  3 lists the main sources of systematic uncertainty along with the level of uncertainty they produce in the fitted density parameters ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath66 , & @xmath148 ) .",
    "the various systematic errors are discussed below , in rough order of importance :    _ dust temperature distribution._ this is the largest source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the temperature distribution that has been assumed in the analysis varies from @xmath81  k at the center to @xmath82  k in the outer regions , and it is motivated by physical argument .",
    "nevertheless , the profile is probably uncertain at the level of @xmath149  k. to study the effect of this uncertainty on the inferred density structure , we have repeated the analysis for each model , replacing the physical temperature distribution with an isothermal distribution at 12  k. the removal of the central minimum in the temperature profile results in a given density model producing a steeper emission profile and a shallower visibility profile .",
    "the density structure inferred is therefore less centrally concentrated than with the physical temperature profile .",
    "the effect is of a similar magnitude for all of the models : the best - fit parameters are changed by close to 2  @xmath112 .",
    "_ unresolved compact component._ the pdbi data limit the maximum contribution to the emission from an unresolved compact component : @xmath0  mjy ( 3  @xmath112 ) . including a dimmer compact component in the model fitting essentially reduces the visibility amplitude that is attributable to the envelope and results in fitted density structures that are more shallow . for a point source flux of @xmath150  mjy ,",
    "the density structure parameters are changed by roughly 1  @xmath112 .",
    "_ central position._ the flatness of the inner density profile and the lack of a detected compact component make the appropriate central position for the l6942 core uncertain .",
    "however , the baselines of the bima visibilities from which the density structure is inferred are short and correspond to a fringe size of @xmath151 .",
    "this means that the results are not very sensitive to small changes in the adopted central position ( the pointing center of the pdbi observations ) .",
    "the signal in the combined visibilities peaks at @xmath152  mjy within @xmath153 of the adopted central position  the peak of n@xmath23h@xmath24(10 ) emission .",
    "a shift in the central position of @xmath154 , i.e.  the shift between the fitted center from the extinction study and central position assumed here , leads to a @xmath155  mjy reduction in the binned signal and a 1  @xmath112 change in the density structure parameters , corresponding to shallower density profiles .",
    "_ extended structure._ a leading source of systematic uncertainty in the l6942 extinction study was the effect of the contribution of the extended structure in which the core appears to be embedded ( harvey et al.2003b ) . including this additional component to the models",
    "lead to inferred core density profiles that were significantly more steep , consistent with plummer - like and isothermal cylinder models . in the present study",
    ", this uncertainty has much smaller effect on inferred structure .",
    "since the extended structure must be largely resolved out by the interferometers , neglecting the extended structure entirely leads to only a 10% increase in the amplitudes of the visibility profiles of the model cores . repeating the fitting analysis for the two types of model in this context results in inferred density profiles that are @xmath76  @xmath112 more shallow .    _",
    "outer boundary._ the outer boundary of the l6942 core has little effect in the modeling due to the limited field of view of bima and pdbi . for bima",
    ", the intensity distribution at the assumed outer edge of the core is suppressed by a factor @xmath156 due to the antenna pattern .",
    "moreover , the intensity at the edge is already lower than the intensity at the center by a factor of @xmath157 ( fit  i ) .",
    "modifying the outer boundary therefore has no effect on the shape of the inferred density profile .",
    "however , for the bonnor - ebert sphere ( fit  i ) , changing the outer radius does modify the density structure parameter @xmath146 because this parameter describes the dimensionless profile , not the physical profile . for this fit , the alternative structure parameter , the scale radius @xmath158 is unchanged .",
    "_ dust opacity spectral index._ the dust opacity adds systematic error via the use of the spectral index to transform the flux normalization from mambo to the frequency at which our observations were made . to some extent",
    ", the appropriate mambo frequency itself depends on the spectral index , because of the broad bandwidth used in the single dish bolometer observations .",
    "the spectral index of the dust opacity should lie in the range @xmath15912 .",
    "we have used @xmath94 throughout ; an alternative extreme , @xmath95 , leads to only a 4% reduction in the flux normalization , and to inferred density structure that is more shallow , but to a degree that is negligible in comparison to the other sources of error ( both systematic and random ) .",
    "the fitted physical models demonstrate clearly that the steep density gradient observed in the @xmath160 region with extinction ( harvey et al .",
    "2003b ) does not continue in the inner region that could not be probed in that study .",
    "this is consistent with the modeling of single dish dust emission observations by visser ( 2000 ) and tafalla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the visibility profiles of the best fit models shown in figure  1 are remarkably similar to each other , only the power law model differing enough to be distinguishable by eye , and then only at long baselines .",
    "this provides an interesting demonstration of the degeneracy of the various models for starless core density structure .",
    "figure  2 presents a plot of the best - fit density models .",
    "the normalization of the density assumes an opacity of @xmath161  @xmath116  g@xmath9 , which is uncertain by a factor of @xmath162 or more ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) . at large radii",
    "the bonnor - ebert and power - law models differ from the plummer - like and cylinder models due to the fact that the latter models are assumed to be embedded in an extended uniform distribution of gas .",
    "the plummer - like and bonnor - ebert models are almost identical , and have central densities that differ by only 5% ( @xmath163  @xmath79 with uncertainty @xmath164% ) .",
    "the density profile of the end - on cylinder departs significantly from the the bonnor - ebert and plummer - like profiles .",
    "the profile is more shallow with much lower central density ( @xmath165  @xmath79 with uncertainty @xmath166% ) .",
    "this occurs despite the identical form of the expressions for the cylinder and plummer - like models ( with @xmath167 ) , and the fact that the cylinder and bonnor - ebert models both represent a balance between self - gravity and thermal pressure .",
    "the difference derives from the lower dimensionality of the cylindrical model ; a given line - of - sight corresponds to a constant `` radius '' , and hence there is no radial integration that for the spherically symmetric models makes the column density profiles more shallow than the density profiles .",
    "in addition , the extension of the cylinder along the line - of - sight means that the densities are correspondingly lower at a given radius .",
    "the asymmetry of the l6942 core viewed in extinction provides a basis for preferring the cylindrical model over the others .",
    "a tilted cylinder with @xmath168 , @xmath169  pc ( @xmath170@xmath171 , and @xmath172@xmath173 ) , and central density ( @xmath174  @xmath79 embedded in a uniform distribution of gas with column density @xmath175  pc@xmath176  @xmath177 , successfully reproduces the dust emission visibility profile , as well as the profile and asymmetry of the dust extinction map .",
    "the instability of the cylindrical model along its axis is also consistent with the inward motions in l6942 inferred from molecular spectral lines ( lee , myers & tafalla 2001 ) .",
    "as already noted , the inner power law index of the fitted broken power law model ( @xmath139 , fit  ii ) may be construed both as a `` mean '' index in the @xmath138 region , and as an upper limit on the index in the innermost regions ( due to the trade - off between turn - over radius and power law index in the inferred visibility profile ) .",
    "the former is illustrated by the fact that the radially averaged `` mean '' effective power law index for the best - fit plummer - like model is @xmath178 over the range in radius @xmath179 ( with @xmath180 ) .",
    "the profile is consistent with the visser ( 2000 ) study who found that a similar index ( @xmath18 ) and turn - over radius ( @xmath181 ) reproduced the scuba map .",
    "the index in the inner region is much less than that observed in the outer envelope and shows that the density distribution in the inner region of the l6942 core has clearly not relaxed fully , along the lines assumed in the inside - out collapse of shu ( 1977 ) , despite the presence of extended inward motion in the gas ( lee et al .",
    "these inward motions may reflect the contraction of a prolate core along its major axis ( harvey et al .",
    "we present a study of the density distribution of the candidate contracting starless core l6942 using high resolution 1.3  mm dust continuum observations from bima and the iram pdbi . in summary :    1 .",
    "the pdbi visibility data span baselines from 12 to 80  k@xmath111 ( spatial scales from @xmath157 to @xmath182  au ) and do not detect any significant emission from the core .",
    "this provides a stringent constraint on the maximum point source flux : @xmath0  mjy ( 3  @xmath112 ) .",

    "we fit four types of model for starless core density structure that can match the steep density gradient in the outer regions inferred from extinction .",
    "we adopt a temperature distribution that decreases in the inner regions due to shielding from the isrf ( evans et al .",
