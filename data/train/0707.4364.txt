    "the reason for this is the combination of its relative proximity ( 120 pc ) and high mass - loss rate ( on average 1.5@xmath410@xmath7m@xmath12yr@xmath13 ; schier & olofsson 2001 ) making it possible to detect , with relative ease , a wealth of different molecular species and allowing for detailed studies of their spatial distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite in a study of a small sample of high mass - loss rate carbon stars , a large spread in molecular fractional abundances , in some cases more than an order of magnitude , were found among the sources .",
    "surprisingly large amounts of oxygen bearing molecules such as , e.g. , h@xmath14o , h@xmath14co , c@xmath15o and sio have been found in the carbon - rich envelope of irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "sio fractional abundance estimates for a large sample of carbon stars also indicates that such ` anomalous ' chemistries might be a common phenomenon in carbon - rich circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) @xcite .",
    "various suggestions as to explain the observed molecular abundances have been made including non - equilibrium chemical processes , fischer - tropsch catalytic processes , and evaporation of cometary bodies @xcite .",
    "one of the molecules that shows least variation in its fractional abundance between carbon stars is hcn , less than a factor of two in the sample of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , imaged a handful of carbon stars , with a large spread in mass - loss rates , in the hcn @xmath1=1@xmath20 transition using the plateau de bure interferometer . combined with a detailed radiative transfer modelling they found that the hcn abundance in their sample varied by less than a factor of three in normal carbon stars .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the hcn abundance is determined close to the photosphere in near equilibrium chemistry and that the shocked non - equilibrium chemistry occurring in the extended pulsating atmosphere only marginally affects the hcn abundance in a carbon - rich environment .",
    "nevertheless , hcn is of great importance for the circumstellar chemistry further out in the envelope where its photodissociation is the start of building more complex carbon chain molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recent studies of sio line emission around irc+10216 by @xcite and @xcite have shown that non - equilibrium chemical processes are required in order to explain the very high amounts ( almost two orders of magnitudes higher than expected from an equilibrium chemistry ) of sio present in or close to the photosphere .",
    "in addition , at @xmath785 stellar radii there is a drastic drop in the fractional abundance by about an order of magnitude explained by effective adsorption onto dust grains .",
    "the effect of shocks is strongly dependent on the c / o - ratio and in a carbon star such as irc+10216 the minor species , such as sio , are expected to be much more strongly affected than the most abundant ones , such as hcn .",
    "also , sio is very refractory compared to hcn , which means that sio will condense at higher temperatures much closer to the star , where the densities are significantly higher , with the result that the fractional abundance of hcn in the gas phase is expected to be much less affected by this process .",
    "lte stellar atmosphere models predict that the hcn fractional abundance in carbon stars is in the range @xmath101@xmath185@xmath410@xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which agrees well with the value of approximately 2@xmath410@xmath7 derived for irc+10216 in the present analysis and with circumstellar values for carbon stars in general @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that hcn is formed in the photosphere under near lte conditions .",
    "recent non - equilibrium chemistry models of the dynamically pulsating atmosphere of agb stars indicate that the passage of shock waves can have a significant effect on the abundance of hcn close to the photosphere .",
    "it is likely that both the c / o - ratio and the shock parameters can have a large effect on the processing of hcn in the innermost part of the wind ( 1@xmath185 stellar radii ) .",
    "the fractional abundance of hcn just before dust formation sets in is estimated to be @xmath104@xmath186@xmath410@xmath61 for carbon stars @xcite , i.e. , up to an order of magnitude lower than those predicted from equilibrium models .",
    "for an extreme carbon star such as irc+10216 , where the c / o - ratio is @xmath101.5 , the initially high hcn fractional abundance ( relative to h@xmath14 ) gets reduced to about 4.4@xmath410@xmath61 at 5 stellar radii",
    "( before dust condensation ) , i.e. , a factor of about five lower than the circumstellar value obtained in the present analysis . however , given the uncertainties involved in both the chemical models and the derived hcn fractional abundance from observations we find that it is not possible to rule out the importance of non - equilibrium chemical processes in the formation of hcn in the ( extended ) atmospheres of irc+10216 .",
    "possibly , a statistical study based on a large survey of circumstellar hcn line emission , from agb stars with varying photospheric ( e.g. , c / o - ratio ) and circumstellar ( e.g. , mass - loss rate ) properties , could provide better constraints on the chemical models .",
    "such work is currently underway ( schier et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the apparent consistency between lte stellar atmosphere models and the derived circumstellar hcn fractional abundance in irc+10216 , together with the suggestion that non - equilibrium chemical processes in the extended atmosphere will serve to reduce the photospheric abundance , indicates that few hcn molecules are incorporated into dust grains .",
    "a detailed excitation analysis , based around a non - lte and non - local radiative transfer code , has been performed for h@xmath0cn in the circumstellar envelope around the extreme carbon star irc+10216 .",
    "new sub - arcsecond interferometric observations of h@xmath0cn @xmath1=8@xmath27 line emission , performed using the sma , put constraints on the hcn abundance distribution on scales @xmath3@xmath79@xmath410@xmath5 cm ( @xmath9330au@xmath928 ) . in combination with multi - transition single - dish observations , probing the emission on larger spatial scales , it is found that the h@xmath0cn fractional abundance remains more or less unaffected in the envelope at about 4@xmath410@xmath6 until photodissociation sets in limiting the size to about 4@xmath410@xmath11 cm ( @xmath92700au@xmath922@xmath29 ) . in the excitation analysis of hcn",
    "it is of utmost importance that radiative excitation through the vibrationally excited states is properly accounted for .",
    "also , hcn provides effective line cooling in the inner part of the envelope ( @xmath32@xmath410@xmath5 cm ) that is higher than that from co. the fractional abundance of hcn derived in the circumstellar envelope of irc+10216 is consistent with model atmosphere predictions and suggests that non - equilibrium chemical processes in the extended pulsating atmosphere has no drastic net effect in regulating the amount of hcn molecules that enters the outer wind .",
