    "low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are generally separated in two different classes , accreting classical ttauri stars ( cttss ) with broad h@xmath6 emission lines , blue continuum and near infrared excess and non - accreting weak - line ttauri stars ( wttss ) with narrow symmetric h@xmath6 emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while cttss typically show large excess emission from the near - infrared to the millimeter , wttss often have no infrared ( ir ) excess at all .",
    "only a relatively small fraction of ttauri stars are observed in an intermediate transition state with little or no near - ir excess and significant far - ir excess .",
    "this clearly indicates that once the inner disk starts to dissipate , the entire disk disappears very rapidly @xcite .",
    "the missing near - ir excess combined with the clear presence of an outer disk is the defining characteristic of transition disks .",
    "however , a precise and generally accepted definition of what constitutes a transition disk object does not yet exist .",
    "the most conservative definition of transition disks , often labeled _ classical transition disks _ , consists of objects with no detectable near - ir excess , steeply rising slopes in the mid - ir , and large far - ir excesses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "being less restrictive , objects with small , but still detectable , near - ir excesses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be included , until considering objects with decrement relative to the taurus median spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at any or all wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . throughout this paper",
    "we follow the latter and broader definition .",
    "however , one has to be aware that this broad definition still is mostly sensitive to inner opacity holes but may overlook pre - transitional disks with a gap separating an optically thick inner disk from an optically thick outer disk .",
    "such systems have been identified from spitzer irs spectra @xcite , but can be missed by photometric selection alone .",
    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope generated a huge database containing ir observations of pms stars in star - forming regions .",
    "most importantly , _ spitzer _",
    "products such as the catalogs of the _ cores to disks ( c2d)_del@xmath7document.pdf ] and _ gould belt spitzer ( gb ) _ legacy projects @xcite provide seds from 3.6 to 24 @xmath8 m for large numbers of pms stars .",
    "one of the most interesting results concerning transition disk studies with _ spitzer _ has been the great diversity of sed morphologies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the widespread of ir sed morphologies found in transition disk objects can not be adapted to the classical taxonomy to describe young stellar objects ( ysos ) such as the class i , ii , iii definitions from @xcite .",
    "@xcite quantified the richness of sed morphologies in terms of two parameters based on the sed shapes considering the longest wavelength at which the observed flux is dominated by the stellar photosphere , @xmath9 , and the slope of the infrared excess , @xmath10 , computed from  @xmath9  to 24 @xmath8 m .",
    "studying the diverse population of transition disks is key for understanding circumstellar disk evolution as much of the diversity of their sed morphologies is likely to arise from different physical processes dominating the disk s evolution .",
    "evolutionary processes that may play an important role include viscous accretion @xcite , photoevaporation @xcite , the magneto - rotational instability ( _ mri _ ) @xcite , grain growth and dust settling @xcite , planet formation @xcite and dynamical interactions between the disk and stellar or substellar companions @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , one can distinguish between some of these processes if certain observational constraints , in addition to the seds , are available . to this end",
    ", we are performing an extensive ground - based observing program to obtain estimates for the disk masses ( from submillimeter photometry ) , accretion rates ( from the velocity profiles of the h@xmath6 line ) , and multiplicity information ( from ao observations ) of _ spitzer_-selected disks in several nearby star - forming regions .",
    "our recently completed study of ophiuchus objects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) confirms that transition disks are indeed a very heterogeneous group of objects with a wide range of sed morphologies , disk masses ( @xmath11 0.5 to 40 m@xmath1 ) and accretion rates . since the properties of the transition disks in our sample point towards different processes driving the evolution of each disk , we have been able to identify strong candidates for the following disk categories : ( giant ) planet - forming disks , circumbinary disks , grain - growth dominated disks , photoevaporating disks , and debris disks .",
    "we here follow the same approach as in paper i in performing multiwavelength observations to derive estimates on disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity .",
    "we present submillimeter wavelength photometry ( from apex ) , high - resolution optical spectroscopy ( from the clay , and du pont telescopes ) , and adaptive optics near - ir imaging ( from the vlt ) for _ spitzer_-selected transition circumstellar disks located in the following star forming regions :",

    "the lupus clouds constitute one of the main southern nearby low - mass star - forming regions containing the following sub - clouds at slightly different distances : lupus i , iv , v , vi at 150 @xmath12 20 pc and lupus iii at 200 @xmath12 20 pc @xcite .",
    "the clouds are situated in the lupus - scorpius - centaurus ob association spanning over 20 deg in the sky .",

    "are estimated to be @xmath13 myr , @xcite . however , a comprehensive analysis using _ spitzer _ irac and mips observations in combination with near - ir ( 2mass ) data has been performed for lupus i , iii , and iv by the _ c2d _ legacy project @xcite and lupus v , vi by the _ gould belt _ legacy project @xcite and revealed a significant difference between the sub - clouds . while lupus i , iii , and iv are dominated by class ii",
    "ysos , lupus v , vi mostly contain class iii objects .",
    "this has been interpreted as a consequence of lupus v , vi being a few myrs older than lupus i , iii , and iv by @xcite . in any case , the lupus star - forming regions represent an excellent test - bed for theories of circumstellar disk evolution as their stellar members should span all evolutionary stages .",
    "the scorpius clouds @xcite lie on the edge of the lupus - scorpius - centaurus ob association , just north of the well studied ophiuchus molecular cloud , but it is highly fragmentary and presents much lower levels of star - formation .",
    "in fact , the _ gould belt _ project only finds 10 ysos candidates in the 2.1 sq deg .",

    "the age of scp is estimated to be @xmath14  myr @xcite .",
    "the cra star - forming region , also mapped by the _ gould belt _",
    "project @xcite , contains an embedded association known as the coronet , a relatively isolated cluster containing haebe stars and ttauri stars @xcite .",

    "these selection criteria result in a primary target list of 60 objects that we did follow - up using different observational facilities to characterize our transition disk candidate sample .",
    "we performed multiwavelength ( optical , infrared , and submillimeter ) observations of our targets with the aim to identify which physical process is primarily responsible for their transition disk nature .",
    "high resolution optical spectra can be used to estimate spectral types and accretion rates from the velocity dispersion of the h@xmath6 .",

    "we describe in detail the observations performed and the data reduction .",
    "we obtained high resolution ( r @xmath19 20,000 ) spectra for our entire sample using 2 different telescopes : magellan / clay and du pont located at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "we observed 49 of our 60 targets with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the 6.5-m clay telescope .",
    "the observations were performed on 2009 april 2728 and 2010 june 1113 . since the ccd of mike s red arm has a pixel scale of 0.13@xmath23/pixel , we binned the detector by a factor of 3 in the dispersion direction and a factor of 2 in the spatial direction , thus reducing the readout time and readout noise .",

    "the ccd s scale is 0.26@xmath23/pixel , and we consequently applied a 2@xmath272 binning .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the obtained spectra ranged between 4000 and 9000  at a resolving power of 32,000 in the red arm .",

    ", our spectroscopic observations showed that our initial sample of 60 transition disk candidates was highly contaminated by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the 17 bona fide pms stars were observed with the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) , the 12-m radio telescope located in llano de chajnantor in chile .",
    "the observations were performed during period 083 ( 083.f-0162a-2009 , 9.2 hrs ) and period 085 ( e-085.c-0571d-2010 , 30.9 hrs ) .",

    "the telescope pointing was checked regularly with scans on nearby bright sources and was found to be stable within 3  ( rms ) .",

    "source integrations of 64 minutes were performed to achieve an rms @xmath26 7 mjy / beam .",
    "the brightest object of the whole sample ( # 2 ) was the only source detected at submillimeter wavelengths in period 083 . during the longer period 085 observing run , the beam switching mode using the wobbling secondary and mapping mode were employed . during this period ,",
    "the remaining nine sources were observed and object # 12 was re - observed with higher sensitivity .",
    "the weather conditions were favorable with precipitable water vapour levels below 1.2  mm .",
    "the wobbler observations of each target consist of a set of two loops of 10 scans per target , reaching a total on - source observing time of 48 minutes .",

    ", we took a few maps in order to check for emission contamination from the off - position . in all cases ,",
    "the contamination was discarded and we confirmed the detection of six sources ( # 3 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ) .",
    "agb stars are surrounded by shells of dust and thus have small , but detectable , ir excesses .",
    "spitzer_-selected yso samples from _ c2d _ and _ gould belt _ catalogs are therefore contaminated by agb stars . using high resolution optical spectra",
    ", we discovered that 43 objects of our candidates are agb stars , while the remaining 17 targets are spectroscopically confirmed ttauri stars .",
    "we separated contaminating agb stars from genuine transition disk ttauri stars in the same way as in paper i , i.e. based on the presence / absence of emission lines associated with chromospheric activity and/or accretion and the presence of the li 6707   absorption line indicating stellar youth .",
    "the coordinates , _ spitzer _ names , the usno - b1 r - band magnitude , and the near to mid - ir fluxes of the agb stars contaminating our sample of transition disks are compiled in table [ t : giants ] .",
    "as shown in table [ t : cont ] the fractional contamination due to agb stars of our color selected transition disk candidates differs significantly between the different clouds .",
    "the number of transition disk candidates is far too small in the case of lupus i and scp to draw any conclusions .",
    "our lupus iii , iv , and cra samples are contaminated by a fraction of agb stars that is more or less consistent with the contamination in ophiuchus ( see paperi , section 4.1.2 ) .",
    "the small number of transition disks in cra seems to be in contradiction with the larger sample identified by @xcite .",
    "however , our selection criteria contain relatively strong brightness constraints ( in particular @xmath34 ) due to the design of our follow - up program which excludes most of the systems listed by them .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in the introduction , a large fraction of the transition disk candidates of @xcite might be classical m - dwarf ttauri stars with intrinsically little near ir excess due to the small color contrast between the disk and the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "apparently , lupusv and vi are dramatically more contaminated than lupus iii , iv , i.e. all the color - selected transition disk candidates are in fact agb stars .",
    "this high percentage of contamination is perhaps related to the position in the galaxy ( see table [ t : cont ] ) .",
    "the lupus complex occupies 334 @xmath11 l @xmath11 352 , + 5 @xmath11 b @xmath11 + 25 , i.e. observing lupusv and vi we are looking towards the galactic center closer to the plane . in contrast , cra and ophiuchus ( paper i ) are located at higher galactic latitudes . in any case , the absence of any spectroscopically confirmed transition disk in lupusv , vi puts doubts on the finding of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their section 5.1 ) that the high fraction of classiii lada systems can _ not _ be explained by contamination . so far all classiii yso candidates from these clouds that have been followed up spectroscopically are clearly contaminating background giants .",
    "our sample of transition disks in lupus v , vi shares 30 classiii objects and one classii object with the sample investigated by @xcite .",
    "all these 31 objects turned out to be agb stars which means that at least @xmath35 and potentially much more of the classiii objects from @xcite are not ysos but giant stars .",
    "this result also questions the conclusion of @xcite that lupus v , vi are significantly older than lupus i , iii .",
    "the generally large fraction of giant stars in our sample of transition disk candidates allows to investigate possible refinements of our color selection algorithm .",
    "figure [ f : ccont ] shows the color - color diagram of the 60 selected southern transition disk targets of this paper .",
    "all transition disk candidates in our sample with @xmath36-[24 ] < 1.8 $ ] turned out to be giant stars .",
    "this agrees quite well with the results obtained for the ophiuchus sample where 4/6 transition disk candidates with [ 3.6]-[24 ] @xmath11 1.8 had to be classified as giant stars ( see paperi , fig.1 ) . consequently , one may derive an estimate of the contamination of yso catalogs due to background giant stars by applying this simple color cut .",
    "figure[f : c2d ] and [ f : gb ] show the transition disk candidates and agb candidates for both the _ c2d _ and _ gb _ catalogs including all star forming regions . note , that we here apply color selection criteria only , i.e. the requirements of @xmath37 mag and @xmath38 mag that have been used to define the transition disk candidate sample for our multiwavelength follow - up program are not incorporated .",
    "instead , here we are interested in estimating the fraction of yso candidates in a given cloud that are likely to be agb stars based on their very low @xmath39 m excess . the resulting rough estimates of giant star contamination are given in table  [ giants - all ] separated by catalog and cloud . according to these estimates",
    ", the agb contamination is expected to vary significantly ranging from @xmath40 per cent .",
    "this shows that agb contamination can have an important impact on studies that are based on the pure numbers of ysos as provided by the _",
    "c2d _ and _ gb _ catalogs .",
    "for example , star formation rates as determined e.g. in @xcite might become significantly smaller if agb contamination is taken into account .",
    "apparently , applying the new more restrictive color selection could also significantly increase the success - rate of identifying ysos directly from color selection criteria and future follow - up studies may take this into account .",
    "the _ spitzer _ and alternative names , 2mass and _ spitzer _ fluxes , and the usno - b1 r - band magnitudes and the relevant information derived from our follow - up observations for the remaining 17 bona fide transition disk candidates are listed in tables [ t : mags ] and [ t : obs ] . in",
    "what follows , we use the data discussed in section  [ obs ] to characterize our sample of transition disks .      in oreder to determine the spectral types of the transition disks in our sample we use the equations by @xcite that empirically relate the spectral type with the strength of the tio5 molecular band .",
    "the uncertainty of this method is estimated to be @xmath260.5 subclasses . for most of our transition disk objects ,",
    "estimates of the spectral types have been provided previously @xcite .",
    "the spectral types obtained by us and those given in the literature are listed in table [ t : obs ] and we find good agreement .",
    "all but one system ( # 2 ) have been classified as m - dwarfs . for target # 2 ,",
    "we adopt the spectral type k0 given by @xcite .",
    "binarity can play an important role in the context of transition disks as the presence of a close stellar companion may cause the inner hole , i.e. some of the transition disks in our sample might actually be nothing else but circumbinary disks . some systems in our sample have been previously identified as wide binaries . @xcite carried out an optical survey of the lupus i , iii , iv regions using bands rc , ic , zwi of the wide - field imager ( wfi ) attached to the eso 2.2-m telescope at la silla observatory .",
    "visual inspection of the images revealed that objects # 1 , # 3 , # 4 , and # 9 are wide binary systems with companions at projected separations of 420 , 1000 , 600 , and 560 au considering the distance of the lupus clouds .",
    "we have newly identified six multiple systems by visual inspection of the naco images , objects # 6 , # 7 , # 11 , # 13 , # 16 , and # 17 ( see figure [ f : mult ] ) .",
    "the projected separations are 0.7@xmath23 , 0.4@xmath23 , 1.15@xmath23 , 1.8@xmath23 , 0.5@xmath23 , 0.5@xmath23 corresponding to 140 , 80 , 230 , 234 , 75 , 75 au at the corresponding distances .",
    "object # 13 is a triple system , i.e. a binary with an additional faint companion at 3@xmath23 ( 390 au ) .    for each binary system",
    ", we searched for additional tight companions by comparing each other s point - spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "the psf pairs were virtually identical in all cases , except for target # 11 .",
    "the south - west component of this target has a perfectly round psf , while the south - east component , @xmath261.5@xmath23 away , is clearly elongated ( see figure [ f : mult ] ) .",
    "since variations in the psf shape are not expected within such small angular distances and this behavior is seen in both the j- and k@xmath22-band images , we conclude that target # 11 is likely to be a triple system .",
    "we have also searched in the literature for additional companions in our sample that our vlt observations could have missed .",
    "in addition to multiple systems discussed above , we find that # 14 has been reported by @xcite as a binary system with a projected separation of 0.13@xmath23 ( corresponding to 20 au ) and flux ratio of 0.7 using speckle interferometry at the new technology telescope in 2001 .",
    "we see no evidence for a bright companion in our naco images ( see figure [ f : mult ] ) .",
    "however , since our ao images were taken 8 years later than the speckle data , it is possible that the projected separation had changed enough in the intervening years for the binary to become unresolved .",
    "hence , our sample consists of eleven multiple systems , i.e. nine binaries ( objects # 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 14 , 16 , 17 ) , and two triples ( objects # 11 and 13 ) . only in the cases of the close b / c pair in object # 11 and # 14",
    "the binary separation is small enough to suspect that the companions might have tidally disrupted the circumbinary disk thereby causing the inner hole inferred from the sed .",
    "however , in neither case the circumbinary nature can be confirmed because it is unknown whether the ir excess in object # 11 originates in the wide a component or the close b / c pair and the multiplicity of object # 14 is not confirmed by our observations .",
    "we therefore only consider these two objects to be circumbinary disk _",
    "candidates_. table [ t : obs ] lists the projected angular separations of the systems .",
    "@xcite modeled the ir and submillimeter seds of circumstellar disks and found a linear relation between the submillimeter flux and the disk mass that has been calibrated by @xcite who obtained @xmath41~m_{\\rm{jup}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the distance to the target .",
    "as described in paper i , disk masses obtained with the above relation are within a factor of 2 of model derived values , which is certainly good enough for the purposes of our survey .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that larger systematic errors can not be ruled out @xcite as long as strong observational constraints on the grain size distributions and the gas - to - dust ratios are lacking .    adopting distances of 150 pc to lupus iv , 200 pc to lupus iii @xcite , 130 pc to scp ( hatchell et al . in preparation ) , and 150 pc to cra @xcite we use equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) to estimate disk masses for the 17 systems in our sample ( see table [ t : derived ] ) .",

    "the obtained velocity dispersion of the h@xmath6 emission lines and the corresponding accretion rate estimates are given in table [ t : obs ] and table [ t : derived ] , respectively .",

    "this information allows to separate the sample according to the physical processes that are the most likely cause of the inner opacity hole : grain growth , planet formation , photoevaporation , or close binary interactions . in",
    "what follows we briefly review each process that might be responsible for the formation of the inner opacity holes , describe our criteria for classifying transition disks , and discuss the corresponding sub - samples of transition disks obtained .",
    "the presence of accretion in classical transition disk objects raises the question how the inner disk can be cleared of small grains while gas remains in the dust hole .",
    "the two mechanisms that can explain the coexistence of accretion and inner opacity holes are grain growth and dynamical interactions with ( sub)stellar companions .      due to both ,",
    "the higher densities and the faster relative velocities of particles in the inner parts of the disk , this disk region offers much better conditions for dust agglomeration than the outer parts of the disk . therefore , significant grain growth should start in the inner disk regions .",
    "as soon as the grains grow to sizes exceeding the considered wavelength ( @xmath57 ) , the opacity decreases until an inner opacity hole forms .",
    "early models by @xcite taking into account only dust coagulation predict much too short timescales of the order of @xmath58yrs to clear the entire disk of small grains , which is inconsistent with observed seds of most classical ttauri stars .",
    "a more reliable picture combines coagulation and collisional fragmentation or erosion of large dust aggregates @xcite .    as a gradual transition between the inner and outer disk",
    "is predicted by grain growth and dust settling models @xcite , grain growth dominated disks should have @xmath59 ( i.e. , falling mid - ir seds ) while @xmath60 , associated with the size of the hole , can differ over a rather wide range of values . although grain growth does not directly affect the gas , it may increase accretion because the inner opacity hole can lead to efficient ionization and trigger the _ mri _ instability @xcite .    among the 17 transition disks in our sample , nine objects are accreting and",
    "are associated with @xmath10  @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding seds are shown in figure [ f : grain - seds ] .",
    "the grain growth candidate systems in our sample could be confounded with accreting classical ttauri m - stars as predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , most of our grain growth dominated disks have seds close to the stellar photosphere up to @xmath62 m and we therefore do not expect significant contamination by non transition disks .",
    "the only exceptions being objects # 5 and 10 with a small value of @xmath9@xmath63 and to some extend # 4 and # 11 ( @xmath9@xmath64 ) .",
    "we recommend the reader to keep in mind the uncertain classification of these four systems .    compared with the oph sample ( paper i ) the accretion rates obtained for grain growth dominated disks are slightly smaller ( i. e. @xmath65m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "this might be related to the slightly lower stellar masses or to advanced viscous evolution as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the grain growth dominated disks are located in the lupus iii , iv ( 8) and the cra ( 1 ) star - forming regions .      the truncation of the disk as the result of dynamical interactions with companions was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that most pms stars are in multiple systems with a lognormal semi - major axis distribution centered at @xmath66au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a significant fraction of the binaries in the star - forming regions considered here should therefore be tight binaries with separations of @xmath67au .",
    "disks in such close binary system will be tidally truncated at @xmath68 the binary separation and a circumbinary disk with an inner hole is formed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sed is that of a transition disk .",
    "however , the circumbinary nature does not exclude additional evolutionary processes to be at work and we therefore provide an additional classification based on the disk properties only ( see table [ t : derived ] ) .",
    "identification of companions that may cause the formation of a circumbinary disk is possible either due to high - resolution imaging or by measuring radial velocity variations . as described in sect .",
    "[ s : naco ] , we identified 2 circumbinary disk candidates among our 17 transition disk systems .",
    "one of them , object # 11 was discovered by inspecting the naco images obtained with the vlt , while the close binary nature of object # 14 has been discovered by @xcite using speckle interferometry at the ntt .",
    "object # 11 shows signs of strong accretion and has a sed with @xmath69 in agreement with grain growth .",
    "it is currently not clear under which conditions gap - crossing streams can exist and allow accretion onto the central star to proceed , but signs of accretion in circumbinary systems @xcite indicate that accretion is likely to continue .",
    "on the other hand , object # 14 is a non - accreting system such as the known binary coku tau@xmath704 @xcite .",
    "according to its l@xmath71/l@xmath72  ratio we classify this system as a circumbinary / photoevaporation disk candidate .    as a final note of caution",
    ", we would like to stress that both objects discussed above ( # 11 and # 14 ) are circumbinary disk _ candidates_. as all but one of our targets are m - type stars , most companions potentially responsible for their transition disk seds are expected to lie at closer separations than those probed by the ao images .",
    "therefore , our sample of circumbinary disk candidates is incomplete and heavily biased towards large separations .",
    "methods more sensitive to closer companions such as aperture masking and/or radial velocity observations are required to draw firm conclusions on circumbinary disk fractions .      the most exciting way to produce",
    "a transition disk sed is by giant planet formation .",
    "according to early models as well as recent numerical simulations , the formation of giant planets involves the formation of gaps and holes in the circumstellar disk @xcite .    as in the case of ( sub)stellar companions it is uncertain if and to what extent accretion proceeds in the presence of a forming giant planet .",
    "therefore , the most important sign of ongoing planet formation remains a sharp inner hole , usually corresponding to @xmath10@xmath73 ( i.e. , a rising mid - ir sed ) .",
    "however , although very useful , the definition of @xmath10  is incomplete , as the sed may also steeply rise at wavelengths longer than @xmath74 m . a spectacular example illustrating this is given by object # 3 . while  @xmath10@xmath75 , the sed steeply rises between @xmath74 m and @xmath76 m .",
    "furthermore , object # 3 shows clear signs of accretion ( @xmath77  m@xmath4/yr ) and of harboring a relatively massive disk ( m@xmath71@xmath78  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "since this is a very atypical object , we verified that the large 70 @xmath8 m flux is not contaminated by extended emission from the molecular cloud .",
    "we examined the 24 and 70@xmath8 m mosaics and verified that the detections are consistent with point sources at the source location ( see figure  [ f : tran6 ] ) . a more typical transition disk system that might represent a currently planet forming disk is target # 15 with a clearly positive value of @xmath10  and a high accretion rate .",
    "a borderline case between grain growth and planet forming disks is object # 2 .",
    "a high accretion rate combined with @xmath10@xmath79 could be consistent with both scenarios . keeping in mind the ambiguity ,",
    "we classify object # 2 as a planet forming disk candidate because it could potentially be an extremely interesting object .",
    "the sed of object # 2 might be explained by a discontinuity in the grain size distribution rather than an inner opacity hole . while the inner part of the disk still contains small grains , outer regions of the disk",
    "might be dominated by slightly larger dust particles .",
    "such a scenario is in excellent agreement with the predictions of numerical simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "they show that the planet ",
    "disk interaction at the outer edge of the gap cleared by a planet can act as a filter passed by small particles only which produces a discontinuity in the dust particle size . to firmly establish its nature object # 2",
    "deserves further follow - up observations ( e.g. , high resolution imaging with alma ) .",
    "the seds of the three candidates for ongoing giant planet formation in our sample are shown in figure [ f : planet - seds ] .",
    "the hosting forming giant planets candidates are located in the lupus iii , iv ( 2 ) and the cra ( 1 ) star - forming regions .",
    "the second main class of transition disks are those that do not show signs of accretion . in such disks the inner opacity hole , i.e. the lack of small dust particles in the inner disk regions , is likely to coincide with a gas hole , i.e. the inner disk is completely drained .",
    "the most important process for clearing the inner disk in transitions disks that do not accrete is photoevaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . according to this model , extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) photons , originating in the stellar chromosphere , ionize and heat the circumstellar hydrogen",
    "which is then partly lost in a wind .",
    "this process is supposed to work in all circumstellar disks but becomes important only when the accretion rate drops to values similar to the photoevaporation rate .",
    "then , the inner disk drains on the viscous timescale supported by the generation of the _ mri _ @xcite .",
    "once an inner hole has formed , the inner disk rim is efficiently radiated and the entire disk should therefore quickly disappear .",
    "photoevaporating disks should have negligible accretion @xcite . to separate photoevaporating disks from debris disks , we require the disk luminosity to be higher than that seen in the brightest bona - fide debris disks , i.e. l@xmath71/l@xmath72  @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "we thus obtained @xmath81 m upper limits from the noise of the @xmath81 m _ spitzer _ mosaics at the source location and calculated l@xmath71/l@xmath72  for our sample by integrating the stellar fluxes and disk fluxes over frequency ( see section 5.1.3 in paper  i for details of the @xmath81 m data analysis and the l@xmath71/l@xmath72  calculation ) .",
    "we classify three transition disks as photoevaporating disk candidates with negligible accretion ( m@xmath82 @xmath11 10@xmath83 yr@xmath5 ) but l@xmath71/l@xmath72  @xmath80 ( table  [ t : derived ] ) .",
    "according to our submillimeter measurements , all these three systems have small disk masses ( @xmath84  m@xmath1 , table  [ t : derived ] ) .",
    "in fact , for all photoevaporation candidates we could only derive upper limits on the disk mass .",
    "the seds of the three systems classified as photoevaporating disk objects are shown in figure [ f : photo - seds ] .",
    "the photoevaporated disks are located in the lupus iii , iv ( 2 ) and cra ( 1 ) star - forming regions .",
    "photoevaporation can be considered as a transition stage between primordial and debris disks .",
    "debris disks contain a small amount of dust and are gas - poor .",
    "we find two debris disk candidates , i.e. non - accreting systems with l@xmath71/l@xmath72@xmath85 , among our 17 transition disks ( see figure [ f : debris - seds ] ) .",
    "the debris disks are located in the cra ( 1 ) and scp ( 1 ) star - forming regions .        in the previous sections , we presented detailed follow - up observations of 60 _ spitzer_-selected transition disk candidates located in the southern star - forming regions lupus i , iii , iv , v , vi , cra , and scp .",
    "optical spectroscopy revealed that only 17 systems of these candidates are genuine transition disk ttauri stars .",
    "deriving estimates for the accretion rates , disk masses , and multiplicity of these 17 systems we classified them as dominated by grain growth ( 9 ) , giant planet formation ( 3 ) , photoevaporation ( 3 ) , or being in the final debris disk stage ( 2 ) .",
    "two of these transition objects , one grain growth ( # 11 ) and one photoevaporating ( # 14 ) , are circumbinary disk candidates , which offers the possibility of tidal truncation as mechanism responsible for an inner hole in the common / shared disk . combining these results with those presented in paperi ,",
    "we now have at hand well - defined and well characterized samples of transition disks from several different star - forming regions .",
    "figure  [ f : alp - lam ] summarizes the properties of these samples based on @xmath10  and @xmath9 .",
    "the main aim of these series of papers is to progress with our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution and to compare transition disk samples of different clouds is key in this respect .",
    "table  [ t : fractions ] shows the fractions of different types of transition disks for ophiuchus ( age @xmath15 @xmath86 myr , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) , cra ( age @xmath15 1 myr , @xcite ) , and lupus i , iii , iv ( age @xmath87myr , @xcite ) .",
    "all yso candidates followed up spectroscopically located in lupus v , vi turned out to be agb stars .",
    "these clouds have been recently estimated to be a few myrs older @xcite based on the dominance of class iii systems . as we have shown in section  [ contamination ] ,",
    "at least @xmath88% of the claimed class iii systems located in lupus v , vi are very likely to be agb stars .",
    "this reduces the fraction of classiii objects to values similar to those obtained for lupus iii .",
    "based on this , lupus v , vi , and iii could well be of a very similar age .",
    "the main result that can be obtained from table  [ t : fractions ] clearly is that young clouds ( @xmath89  myr ) contain a mixture of grain growth , photoevaporating , debris , and tidally disrupted transition disks .",
    "it is clear that all states of disk evolution are already present at this age range , which implies that different disks evolve at different rates and/or through different evolutionary paths .",
    "an important difficulty in constraining disk evolution is that stellar ages obtained from isochrones are very uncertain for individual systems .",
    "an analysis of the stellar age distributions of each disk category is therefore postponed to paper iii ( cieza et al . 2012",
    ", apj submitted ) , where we discuss a larger sample of well characterized transition disk objects including the systems presented here .",
    "the general picture of photoevaporation is the following . in very young disks",
    ", the accretion rate largely exceeds the evaporation rate and the disk evolves virtually unaffected by photoevaporation . as the accretion rate is decreasing with time , the disk necessarily reaches the time when the accretion rate equals the photoevaporation rate and the outer disk is no longer able to resupply the inner disk with material . at this point , the inner disk drains on the viscous timescale ( @xmath0  @xmath58  yr ) and an inner hole of a few au in radius is formed in the disk .",
    "the inner disk edge is now directly exposed to the euv radiation and the disk rapidly photoevaporates from the inside out .",
    "early models of euv photoevaporation predict evaporation rates of @xmath90m@xmath4/yr @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations taking into account x - ray @xcite and/or far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) irradiation @xcite in addition to the euv photons , largely exceed these early predictions , reaching photoevaporation rates of the order of @xmath91m@xmath4/yr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as in steady state accretion disks the mass transfer through the disk is roughly proportional to the mass accretion rate onto the star , a crucial prediction of the photoevaporation model is that high photoevaporation rates imply high disk masses at the time the inner disk is drained . in particular , models with efficient x - ray photoevaporation predict a significant population of relatively massive ( @xmath267  m@xmath1 ) non - accreting transition disks @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : photo - mass ] shows the upper limits ( derived from submillimeter non detections ) on the disk masses of the photoevaporating transition disks in all the clouds we considered so far . even taking into account uncertainties in our classification of photoevaporation candidates , it is evident that large numbers of non - accreting but massive disks do not exist .",
    "this indicates that photoevaporation is less efficient than predicted by the models described above .",
    "however , one has to take into account that the sample of transition disks considered here contains low - mass stars only while model calculations have been performed exclusively for more massive stars @xmath92m@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , either a more homogeneous sample of photoevaporating disk systems covering a larger range of host star masses ( earlier spectral types ) or simulations of photoevaporation for disks around low - mass stars are required to provide a final answer on this issue .",
    "of course , our classification of transition disk objects is based on rather rough empirical relations and requires to carefully consider possible caveats .",
    "an obvious uncertainty concerns our multiplicity survey .",
    "the method of direct detection of companions is obviously more sensitive to binaries with large separations and low inclinations .",
    "our naco observations are sensitive to projected separations of @xmath93au given the distance to our targets and  depending on the intrinsic distribution of orbital separations  we may therefore miss a significant fraction of close binaries . to overcome this observational bias we are currently performing radial velocity measurements of our targets using vlt / uves .",
    "the method of detecting radial velocity variations is more sensitive to small separations and high inclinations and therefore complements the imaging results presented here .",
    "we will present the results in a forthcoming paper .",
    "however , the fact that only 6 of the 43 transition disks studied herein and in paper  i are circumbinary disk candidates strongly suggests that binaries at the peak of their separation distribution ( @xmath26 30 au ) do not result in transition disk objects as such stellar binaries would be easily detectable by our ao observations .",
    "instead , they are likely to destroy the disk rather quickly @xcite .",
    "another uncertainty in our classification procedure is the rather ad - hoc separation between photoevaporating and debris disk systems by using a limit in l@xmath71/l@xmath72 .",
    "however , there is a physical and not only phenomenological difference between these two types of transition disks .",
    "photoevaporating disks are dissipating primordial disks and should have gas rich outer disks while the debris disks should be gas poor .",
    "molecular line observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) of non - accreting disks will be able to distinguish between the two types of objects .    a huge problem related to the process of photoevaporation is that the mass loss rates predicted by different models differ by up - to two orders of magnitude ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the disk mass at the time photoevaporation opens a hole in the disk is directly connected to the photoevaporation rates . measuring",
    "the disk masses of photoevaporating disks could therefore significantly constrain theoretical models of photoevaporation . however ,",
    "all of the photoevaporting disk candidates remain undetected and we can only put upper limits to their masses . fortunately , alma will be much more sensitive than all presently available telescopes and will soon be able to measure the masses of many bona fide photoevaporating disks .",
    "alma should also be able to measure , through high resolution continuum observations at multiple wavelengths , the radial dependence in the grain size distribution expected in the grain - growth dominated disks .    finally , the recent identification using the aperture masking technique of what seems to be forming planets within the inner cavities of the transition disks around t cha @xcite and lkca 15 @xcite strongly encourages to obtain similar observations for the three planet - forming disk candidates identified herein , objects # 2 , # 3 , and # 15 .",
    "any system with a planet still embedded in a primordial disk would represent an invaluable laboratory to study planet formation with current and future instrumentation .",
    "we have carried out a multifrequency study of _ spitzer_-selected yso transition disk candidates located in the lupus complex ( 53 ) , cra ( 5 ) , and scp ( 2 ) .",
    "we obtained submillimeter observations ( apex ) , optical high resolution echelle spectroscopy ( clay / mike , du pont / echelle ) , and nir images ( from ao imaging vlt / naco ) . after deriving spectral types of each target ,",
    "43 agb stars were removed ( lupus complex ( 41 ) , cra ( 1 ) , and scp ( 1 ) ) , leaving a sample of 17 genuine transition disk systems .",
    "we find that the vast majority of agb stars have [ 3.6]-[24 ] @xmath11 1.8 , underscoring the need for a spectroscopic confirmation of yso candidates with small 24@xmath8 m excesses .",
    "the data obtained for the 17 transition systems allows to estimate multiplicity , stellar accretion rates , and disk masses thereby allowing to identify the physical mechanism that is most likely to be responsible for the formation of the inner opacity hole .",
    "the observational results of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the derived spectral classification indicates that all but one ( object # 2 , k0 ) central star are m - type stars , in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "12/17 targets are accreting objects ( i.e. asymmetric h@xmath6 profile having a velocity width  200 km s@xmath5 at 10@xmath28 of peak intensity ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath26 50@xmath28 of the sample are multiple systems and among them , two triple systems .",
    "two binary systems have small projected separations and are therefore candidates to host a circumbinary disk .",
    "7/17 targets have flux detection in the submillimeter . for the remaining systems ,",
    "we derive and upper limit of the disk mass ( corresponding to a flux of 3 @xmath27 rms ) .",
    "the estimated disk masses for the detected objects cover the range 2  m@xmath110  m@xmath1 .",
    "combining the derived estimates of disk masses , accretion rates and multiplicity with the sed morphology and fractional disk luminosity ( l@xmath71/l@xmath72 ) allows to classify the disks as strong candidates for the following categories :    * 9/17 grain growth - dominated disks ( accreting objects with negative sed slopes in the mid - ir , @xmath10@xmath11 0 ) . * 3/17 photoevaporating disks ( non - accreting objects with disk mass @xmath11 3  m@xmath1 , but ) . * 2/17 debris disks ( non - accreting objects with disk mass @xmath11 2.1  m@xmath1  and ) . * 2/17 circumbinary disks ( a binary tight enough to accommodate both components within the inner hole ) . *",
    "3/17 giant planet forming disk ( accreting systems with seds indicating sharp inner holes ) .    inspecting in more detail the different sub - clouds analyzed in this study we find the same heterogeneity of the transition disk population in lupus iii ,",
    "iv , cra as in our previous analysis of transition disks in ophiuchus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paperi ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that photoevaporation , giant planet formation , and grain growth produce inner holes on similar timescales .",
    "not a single transition disks has been found in lupus i , v , vi . all 33 candidates that have been spectroscopically followed up turned out to be agb stars which questions the recent interpretation of @xcite that lupus i , v , vi might be relatively old star forming regions dominated by classiii objects .",
    "in addition , our detailed observational analysis of transition disks provides clear constraints on theoretical models of disk photoevaporation by the central star . according to the large evaporation rates predicted by recent models ( i.e. see * ? ? ? * ) , large numbers of massive photoevaporating transition disks systems should exist .",
    "in contrast to this prediction , all photoevaporating disk candidates identified in this work and paperi contain very little mass , indicating much smaller evaporation rates at least for the low - mass stars considered here .",
    "similarly , the low incidence of circumbinary transition disk candidates ( @xmath26 10@xmath28 ) supports the idea that most disks are destroyed rather quickly by companions at @xmath94 au separations .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the 43 transition disk systems discussed in this work and in paperi represent the currently largest and most homogeneous sample of well - characterized transition disks . further investigating these systems with new observing capabilities such as",
