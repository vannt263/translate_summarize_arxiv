    "in this article , we study a basic first - passage characteristic of random walks on erds - renyi ( er ) random graphs @xcite , namely , the mean time for a random walk to traverse between two arbitrary sites on the graph .",
    "the er random graph is constructed by taking @xmath1 sites and introducing a bond between each pair of sites with probability @xmath0 . when @xmath2 , all possible links exist and this construction gives the complete graph , where each site is connected to all the other @xmath3 sites in the graph .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , the random graph undergoes a percolation transition at @xmath4 @xcite that shares many common features with percolation on regular lattices .",
    "another geometrical feature that is relevant for our study of first - passage characteristics is a second connectivity transition at @xmath5 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "all nodes belong to a single component ( in the limit @xmath7 ) , while for @xmath8 disjoint clusters can exist @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to determining basic properties of random walks in disordered or heterogeneous environments , @xcite , such as the er random graph , as well as small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite . on the random graph ,",
    "there has been considerable work in determining how basic time scales of the random walk depend on the size of the graph .",
    "these include the mixing time  the time scale that determines how the probability distribution approaches its limiting behavior @xcite , the cover time  the time for a random walk to visit all sites of the graph @xcite , and the first - passage time  the time for a random walk to traverse between two specified points for the first time @xcite or to return to its starting point for the first time @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to understand by simple physical arguments how a basic first - passage property of random walks on random graphs depends on the concentration of bonds in the graph",
    ". we will begin by studying the mean first - passage , or transit , time @xmath9 for a random walk to reach an arbitrary site @xmath10 on the graph when starting from another arbitrary site @xmath11 . in general , this transit time @xmath9 does not necessarily equal @xmath12 and it is sometimes convenient to consider the mean commute time @xmath13 to avoid the asymmetry in @xmath9 .",
    "however , in averaging over all pairs of sites @xmath11 and @xmath10 to obtain statistically meaningful quantities , the asymmetry is eliminated and @xmath14 .    in practice , mean transit and commute times diverge when the graph consists of more than one component ( cluster ) , because a random walk that starts in one component can not access sites in different components .",
    "we are thus led to study the dependence of the mean commute rate @xmath15 as a function of @xmath0 on the random graph .",
    "this rate equals zero for two sites in different components , so that its configurational average is meaningful .",
    "focusing on the commute rate is analogous to considering mean conductance of a random conductor - insulator mixture near the percolation threshold , rather than the mean resistance .",
    "the conductance is well - behaved near the percolation threshold , while the resistance is divergent for all @xmath0 in any finite - size system .    in the next section ,",
    "we construct an effective medium approximation that predicts that the mean commute time is independent of @xmath0 for @xmath6 .",
    "we also find that the transit time varies weakly with @xmath0 in the small - dilution limit . in sec .",
    "iii , we present simulation results for the mean commute time and the mean commute rate and find an unexpected non - monotonic behavior for the latter quantity as a function of @xmath0 when @xmath16 . in sec .",
    "iv , we outline the relation between the commute time on a network and the two - point conductance on the same network when each link is a unit resistor .",
    "we use this electrical network connection to explain the non - monotonicity of the commute rate , first for a tree structure that is a subset of the random graph ( sec .",
    "v ) , and then for the random graph itself ( sec .",
    "we now develop an effective medium approximation for the commute time of a discrete - time random walk on the random graph @xcite . in a single time step ,",
    "a walk located at a site that is connected to @xmath17 other sites can hop with probability @xmath18 to any of these neighbors . to compute the mean time for such a random walk to go between two arbitrary sites on any graph by a sequence of nearest - neighbor hops , we use the underlying backward equation @xcite .",
    "this equation relates the transit time from site @xmath11 to site @xmath10 to the transit times from the neighboring sites of @xmath11 to site @xmath10 as follows : @xmath19 the first sum is over all paths @xmath20 from @xmath11 to @xmath10 , @xmath21 is the probability for the random walk to take the path @xmath20 , and @xmath22 is the transit time from @xmath11 to @xmath10 along this path . for each path",
    ", we then decompose the full transit time into the time to go from @xmath11 to an intermediate site @xmath23 after one step plus the time to go from @xmath23 to @xmath10 .",

    "finally , we average the transit time over all pairs of terminal points and over all graph configurations . again in the spirit of an effective medium approximation , this average is simply @xmath40 surprisingly , @xmath41 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus according to the effective medium approach , the complete graph solution , @xmath42 , holds for all @xmath0 .    the backward equation for the mean transit time can be extended to any positive integer moment of the transit time .",
    "consider , for example , the mean - square transit time .",

    "we drop these angle brackets because the linear and quadratic powers of time always appear separately and there is no ambiguity about where the angle brackets should appear .",

    "for the conductance itself , it is worth noting that this function behaves anomalously near the connectivity transition . although the conductance must increase monotonically with @xmath110 @xcite , the rate of increase changes for @xmath110 in the critical range between 1 and @xmath126 ( fig .",

    "first , bonds that are not examined in the initial construction of the rgt can only exist between sites in the same or in adjacent shells of the rgt .",
    "a second important point is that in building the rgt , each examined bond was tested one time only and is therefore included in the rgt with probability @xmath0 .    since the number of sites in successive shells of the rgt grows exponentially in the number of steps away from the root , the radius of the largest cluster ( giant component ) ,",

    "( [ cr - tree - prob ] ) as @xmath150 in the analogous expression for @xmath151 , the numerator increases by @xmath152 while the denominator increases by @xmath153 . thus @xmath154 is a decreasing function of @xmath146 , so that a tree with a larger radius will have a smaller commute rate .    as argued in sec .",
    "v , a further increase in @xmath110 will cause the radius of the rgt to eventually decrease with @xmath110 .",
    "correspondingly , the commute rate enters regime iii and increases with @xmath110 . in this regime , we now use the fact that the number of sites in successive shells of the rgt grows exponentially in the distance from the root . thus the shell at radius @xmath146 contains almost all of the sites of the rgt . as a naive approximation",
    ", we then replace the sum in eq .",
    "( [ cr - tree - prob ] ) by the last term to give , in the limit of large @xmath110 , @xmath155 this result agrees extremely well with numerical results for the commute rate on rgts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rgtsmall ] .",
    "we now investigate how adding loops to the rgt to build a random graph affects the behavior of the mean commute rate .",
    "starting with a realization of an rgt we generate a cluster of the random graph by adding missing bonds , following the procedure discussed in sec .",
    "v. the addition of these bonds will create loops that provide alternative paths between the root site and the endpoints of a random walk ( fig .",
    "[ rgloops ] ) .",
    "the ostensible effect of these additional paths is to increase the commute rate between the root and any endpoint .     from the root .",
    "a site in this last shell will typically have @xmath110 independent paths to the root .",

    "an rgt is grown around both @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the two rgts meet at a distance @xmath157 from each of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "broken lines are links between sites in the outermost shells of the two respective rgts . , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    to estimate the two - point conductance for a random graph for general @xmath158 , we start with the picture that the graph consists of two rgts , one emanating from @xmath11 and the other from @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ tworgts ] ) . for a graph of @xmath1 sites ,",
    "the radius of each tree is of order @xmath159 .",
    "we argue that these two trees tend to join only at the outermost shell because this is where most of the sites in the trees are located .",
    "we further assume that , in the equivalent resistor network , all sites at the same distance from the root are at the same potential .",
    "thus the conductance of the two joining rgts is simply one - half of the conductance between the root and the last shell of a single rgt .    for this last step ,",
    "we approximate the rgt by an infinite cayley tree with branching ratio @xmath110 .",
    "the resistance between the @xmath90-th and the @xmath160 shell in this tree is @xmath161 , since the links between the two shells are in parallel . because the shells are in series , the resistance from the center to infinity is simply the geometric sum , @xmath162 .",
    "thus the conductance between @xmath11 and @xmath10 is @xmath163 . substituting this result in eq .",
    "( [ cr - densegraph ] ) , then gives the commute rate @xmath164 this result converges to 1 as @xmath165 , in agreement with the effective medium approach in sec ii as well as our simulation results .",
    "closer to the percolation threshold , however , eq .  ( [ cr - cayley - appx ] ) and simulation results quantitatively disagree because our naive picture for the structure of the random graph no longer applies .",
    "thus we observe that the eventual increase in the commute rate ( regime iii ) stems from the combined effect of the decrease in the radius of the underlying rgt embedded within a random graph cluster and the emergence of loops that join two rgts in the random graph .",
    "we studied a basic first - passage characteristic of random walks on random graphs that is related to the time for a walk to travel between two arbitrary points on a graph .",
    "we first constructed an effective medium theory and a small dilution approximation for this mean transit time .",
    "the former approach predicted that the mean transit time , and also all positive integer moments of the transit time , are independent of the bond concentration @xmath0 for @xmath0 greater than the connectivity threshold @xmath5 .",
    "the small dilution approximation also predicts a slow dependence of the transit time on @xmath0 near @xmath2 .",
    "our numerical simulation results are in qualitative accord with a transit time that is slowly varying in @xmath0 for @xmath6 .    below the connectivity threshold ,",
    "the transit time is not well defined because the mean time for a random walk to hop between sites on different components of a disconnected graph is infinite . to avoid this pathology",
    ", we studied the inverse of the commute time , namely , the commute rate .",
    "we developed a simple heuristic picture for the behavior of the commute rate that relied on first identifying an embedded rooted geodesic tree ( rgt ) within an arbitrary random graph cluster .",
    "for the rgt , it is simple to compute the commute rate in terms of a geometric picture for the tree and thus argue that this rate is a non - monotonic function of @xmath0 in the critical regime .",
    "we then presented a simple physical picture for the influence of loops on the behavior of the commute rate .",
    "qualitatively , the dependence of the radius of the underlying rgt on the bond concentration explains the behavior of the commute rate close to the percolation threshold . for larger @xmath110 loops",
    "become an important factor and are ultimately responsible for the non - monotonic dependence of the commute rate on @xmath0 .",
