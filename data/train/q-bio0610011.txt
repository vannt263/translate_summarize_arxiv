    "to preserve the identity of a species , biological organisms must be capable of maintaining relatively stable phenotype expression in the face of a variety of environmental factors and a certain level of genetic randomness .",
    "experimental observations have shown that certain developmental traits appear to control the expression of other traits .",
    "waddington @xcite termed the control of one trait by another `` canalization , '' a name derived from the analogy that the developmental pathway of the organism is like one particular canal in a floodplain , and the further development of the organism is completely constrained by that canal .",
    "canalization produces robustness because it suppresses those changes in phenotype expression that would require development to deviate from the canalized pathway . for this reason",
    "it has been suggested that organisms evolve to be canalized .",
    "the significance of canalization and how it might evolve remains a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "since canalization suppresses the expression of genetic variability , experimental detection of the existence of a canalized trait generally involves perturbing the organism out of the canalized state @xcite .",
    "there is good evidence for the existence of canalization in a variety of organisms @xcite ; however , the microscopic mechanism for canalization is not well established .",
    "presumably canalization is produced genetically by the complex interactions between genes known as the genetic regulatory network ( grn ) .",
    "as we shall see , however , a certain amount of canalization is expected to appear in grns even in the absence of an evolutionary preference for canalization .",
    "an open question is whether or not real grns contain more canalization than would be expected from a random graph , which could indicate that evolution favors canalization .",
    "genetic regulatory networks have been proposed as the mechanisms through which identical genetic information is expressed as different cell types within the same organism , and they can also control distinct stages in the life cycle of an individual cell . depending on the conditions experienced by a given cell and the regulatory interactions between genes , at any moment a distinct subset of all possible genes are activated .",
    "the state or temporal pattern of expression produces particular cell types .",
    "organisms with larger numbers of genes have a larger number of potentially realizable cell types .",
    "there has been a recent dramatic increase in the amount of experimental information available on the structure of genetic regulatory networks in a range of organisms , including _",

    "@xcite , _ drosophila _ species @xcite , _ xenopus _",
    "@xcite , and the embryo of the sea urchin _ s. purpuratus _ @xcite . in the simplest representation ,",
    "the nodes of the network are genes and the links between genes describe their interactions . generally , the interactions are directional , so that the expression of gene a may depend on , that is `` listen to , '' the expression of gene b , but the expression of gene b does nt necessarily depend directly on the expression of gene a. the connectivity of a gene indicates how many other genes it `` listens to '' when determining whether to be in an active or inactive state .",
    "analysis of the connectivity of _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite and other grns shows a broad distribution of connectivity among the genes , with a significant amount of negative autoregulation . in the context of canalization ,",
    "several questions arise .",
    "what types of structures in a grn produce canalization of a trait ?",
    "do these structures arise randomly , or do they only appear because of a special evolutionary preference ? how significant is canalization on the scale of the entire regulatory network ?    the easiest way to approach such questions is through a simplified model for a genetic regulatory network such as the kauffman n - k model @xcite , which represents the grn as a random boolean network .",
    "the n - k model has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "certain features of real grns , including the ability of a single network to produce multiple cell types ( which appear as multiple attractors for the network ) , are captured by the n - k model . in this model ,",
    "each gene is represented by a single binary element which can be either on or off in the state 1 or 0 .",
    "every gene receives input from a fixed set of @xmath2 other genes that are randomly chosen when the network is constructed , where @xmath1 . depending on the states of its input genes",
    ", a given gene determines whether to express the state 1 or 0 according to a randomly chosen boolean function of @xmath2 variables .",
    "an example of a boolean function for @xmath3 is given in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 may vary from gene to gene .",
    "the system evolves in discrete time steps and all genes update their states simultaneously .",
    "the entire network eventually settles into an attractor cycle which produces a specific series of network states as a function of time .",
    "the initial conditions of the states of the genes in the network determine which of the available attractors the network will reach .",
    "the different attractors are interpreted as representing different cell types expressed by a given set of genes .",

    "canalization occurs in a boolean function if the output of the gene is fixed by a particular value of at least one of its input genes , regardless of the values of any other inputs to that gene . in this case",
    "the input that fixes the output of the regulated gene is a _ canalizing input_. note that one value of an input gene , say value 0 , can be a canalizing input even if the other value 1 from the same input gene is not canalizing .",
    "canalization also occurs in a boolean function if particular values of two or more inputs together suffice to guarantee the next state of the regulated gene , regardless of the values of any other inputs to the gene . in this case",
    ", the inputs that together fix the output of the regulated gene are said to be _ collectively canalizing inputs_. how canalizing a particular boolean function is can be quantified by the set of numbers @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which are the fraction of sets of @xmath10 individual input values that are canalizing or collectively canalizing .",
    "note that boolean functions with @xmath11 have a fixed output state regardless of their inputs .",
    "boolean functions can also be characterized by their internal homogeneity @xmath12 which is defined as the fraction of 1s or 0s , whichever is larger , output by the function due to all of the possible sets of input @xcite .",
    "a consequence of canalization is that some of the interactions between genes may become irrelevant . as an extreme example , if the boolean function of a particular gene has @xmath11 , this gene will be insensitive to the state of the rest of the network and its interactions with its input genes are irrelevant .",
    "the number of canalizing functions as a function of @xmath2 was derived recently in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although the behaviour of canalizing functions would certainly contribute to the stability of a network that is subjected to random perturbations , such an extreme behaviour has a detrimental effect on the ability of the network to respond to changing conditions .",
    "in contrast , other boolean functions successfully maintain a degree of stability while retaining the ability to change .",
    "for these boolean functions , which we will refer to as `` partially canalizing , '' the gene may ignore one or more of its inputs under certain conditions . in some cases",
    ", the gene completely ignores @xmath10 inputs at all times , so that its effective connectivity is @xmath13 .",
    "in other cases , if a particular input has the value 1 , for example , the gene ignores the remaining inputs , but if that same input has the value 0 , the gene listens to its other inputs . here , the effective connectivity of the gene depends on the current state of the network .",
    "more complex categories are also possible , such as the nested canalizing functions proposed by kauffman @xcite . since the fraction of canalizing functions drops rapidly with @xmath2 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been assumed that canalization plays a less important role at high @xmath2 compared to small @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the class of partially canalizing functions is considerably larger than the class of canalizing functions ; however , is it large enough to dominate all classes of functions ? as we will show below on mathematical grounds , the partially canalizing functions completely dominate the class of all possible boolean functions as @xmath2 increases , so that the emergence of canalization is essentially unavoidable in a complex network .",
    "our approach is to examine the properties of individual boolean functions and to determine the amount of canalization expected from a random sample of functions .",
    "since the number of possible boolean functions explodes combinatorially with @xmath2 , we employ powerful techniques from group theory and isomer chemistry to classify the various functions and help obtain their properties .",
    "we provide results through @xmath14 with these methods .",
    "the techniques can be applied readily to higher @xmath2 , but become increasingly complicated .",
    "therefore , to find results for larger @xmath2 through @xmath15 we employ statistical sampling methods .    for small enough @xmath2 , the canalization properties of the functions can be obtained directly from inspection . when there are two inputs for each gene , @xmath16 , as shown in table 2 , there are only 16 possible functions which fall into four classes : fixed ( or completely canalizing ) with @xmath11 ; sensitive to both inputs with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; and the partially canalizing cases with @xmath17 and @xmath19 : sensitive to only one input ; sensitive to one or two inputs depending on the value of one input .",

    "a far more dangerous case is a partially canalizing interaction between genes in which a gene ignores one or more inputs when a canalizing input has a value of 1 ( for example ) , but responds to the other inputs when that same canalizing input has a value of 0 .",

    "the natural predominance of canalization as @xmath2 increases suggests that the canalization observed experimentally could be due simply to the high fraction of the available boolean functions which are canalizing , rather than evolutionary pressure to develop canalizing functions .",
    "it is , however , unclear how much canalization is present in real genetic regulatory networks , as discussed in ref .",
    "it is possible that there is in fact a special evolutionary preference for canalization , which could result in real networks having even higher levels of canalization than would be expected from random selection at increasing @xmath2 . in order to answer this question",
    "it would be necessary to measure the _ excess canalization _",
    ", which is the difference between the @xmath8s observed in real networks and that in random networks @xcite .",
    "the existing experimental data on genetic regulatory networks is not extensive enough to determine whether an interaction between genes is canalizing or partially canalizing .",
    "as noted above , the difference between the two types of interactions can become important when the network is perturbed away from its native state .",
    "more experimental work is needed in order to determine the prevalence of canalization and/or partial canalization in actual genetic regulatory networks .",
    "the boolean models can offer guidance in determining how likely it would be to observe any type of canalization in a random network .",
    "in conclusion , we have used a mapping of the boolean functions in the kauffman model for genetic regulatory networks onto a @xmath0hypercube to obtain information about the classes into which the functions can be divided .",
    "these classes arise due to geometrical constraints , and can be constructed by applying all possible rotations of the @xmath0hypercube plus parity to each function .",
    "the classes can be counted and their properties determined using results from group theory and isomer chemistry .",
    "we emphasize that partially canalizing functions completely dominate all possible functions , particularly for higher @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that partial canalization should be extremely common , even in a randomly chosen network , and has implications for how much information can be obtained in experiments on native state genetic regulatory networks .",
