    "the einstein equations are one of the pillars of the general relativity ( gr ) because they are quantifying the relationship between matter and the spacetime curvature .",
    "the conventional gr prescription says that the curvature of the spacetime is a manifestation of the presence of matter and this fact is encoded in the einstein equations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor associated to the matter content .",
    "needless to say that the finding physically interesting solutions to these equations is a difficult task due to their high nonlinearity .    nevertheless , there are nontrivial configurations without back reaction on the geometry of the spacetime in which it has been shown the existence of a reverse reaction on the geometry of spacetime .",
    "these fields are called _ stealths _ ,  @xcite .",
    "such configurations are obtained from the einstein equations when one impose the vanishing of them including customary matter , and for the other hand , the vanishing of an energy - momentum tensor associated to a non - minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath2 , independently @xmath5 originally it was shown the existence of these configurations in  @xcite for the well known @xmath6-dimensional btz static black hole and later on in @xmath7-dimensions for the minkowski flat spacetime  @xcite .",
    "thenceforth , this idea was implemented in several spacetimes : in an ( a)ds spacetime  @xcite , and in the cosmology context  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in @xmath8 dimensions , for higher - order gravity theories  @xcite in the lovelock gravity context  @xcite as well as in the non - relativistic version of the gauge / gravity correspondence in lifshitz spacetime  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a stealth schwarzschild solution arise in context of galileons theory , in particular , on shift - symmetric part of hordenski action , which is used to study no - hair theorems in a spherically symmetric spacetime @xcite and its charged generalization @xcite . in all these works , the stealth scalar field arises from the well known non - minimal coupling @xmath9 in general relativity .",
    "in contrast with the ordinary matter , it is believed that the distinctive of these configurations is ability to be undetectable in the ambient spacetime which makes it an interesting phenomenon which could explain some current phenomena of the gravitation as in the case of dark matter / energy .",
    "the mechanism described above is quite general and can be applied for different spacetimes .",
    "indeed , the current implementation of this idea on diverses geometries is under investigation in order to get a good understanding of the physical content behind the stealth setups . despite the criticism on the instability of the stealth configurations",
    ", we believe that this framework should not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , it has recently emerged a strong interest in part because of the conformal symmetry properties and the potential cosmological implications that have this type of structures  @xcite .    in this work we will merely present , but without giving any compelling physical conclusion , exact solutions for stealth configurations arising in the context of black hole physics for lower dimensions .",
    "specifically , such configurations are realized by considering a non - minimally coupled scalar field , evolving in a two - dimensional charged dilatonic black hole background  @xcite .",
    "inspired in the string theory , this black hole is very interesting in its own right due to their properties on the quantum effects in the black hole physics and by the their implications in the quantization of nonconformal fields , mainly .",
    "the solution for this geometry comes from string theory in two dimensions where its structure is equivalent to the planar symmetry of general relativity  @xcite . due to the fact that the two - dimensional dilatonic black hole satisfy einstein equations ,",
    "then it is also considered as a genuine black hole in general relativity . when the exact solutions are obtained in this work , as a byproduct , one is able to identify the self - interacting potential for the stealth scalar field . at the moment",
    "there is no close relationship with any physical potential so it remains to be understood the role that such potential play .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we review briefly the coupling between a non - minimally scalar field with a @xmath0-d charged dilatonic black hole . in sect .",
    "3 we obtain exact solutions for stealth configurations considering the two - dimensional charged dilatonic black holes .",
    "in addition , we discuss some interesting cases for @xmath10 where stealth scalar field configurations appear . in all cases we were able to compute the accompanying self - interacting potentials . finally , in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] we give some conclusions .",

    "note that the action can be splitted in two parts , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , that is , the gravitational and the scalar field sectors , respectively .",
    "the first part corresponds to the @xmath21 dilatonic gravity approach  @xcite which is the version of the einstein - hilbert theory in two dimensions with physical degrees of freedom and the second part corresponds to the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , besides the constant @xmath22 , the quantity @xmath23 plays the role of a gravitational coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in stealth configurations for the scalar field @xmath2 , the quantity @xmath23 is not multiplying the second part of the action . in the stealth scalar field framework",
    ", these non - trivial configurations do not produce backreaction .",
    "these must be treated separately from the gravitational sector .",
    "the corresponding field equations are obtained from the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the associated fields @xmath24 where the stealth s energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath25 this expression is the key point in the search for stealth configurations .",
    "we have to impose the vanishing condition of the l.h.s of the eq .",

    "work is in progress .",
    "for example , with regards the potential function , a more detailed analysis on the integration constants and the values of @xmath15 is mandatory in order to have an acceptable behaviour .",
    "in addition , the relationship of this potential with a known physical system does not exist yet .    on the other hand , the behavior of the stealth will depend strongly on the value of the exponent of @xmath2 ( see eqs .",

    "the stealth has positive exponents of @xmath74 , and the behaviour seems like a typical polynomial function . as mentioned in the text , the particular value @xmath55 casts out a linear dependence of the stealth in the coordinate @xmath74 which leads to a unbounded behaviour because the stealth will permeate the space as @xmath74 grows . to end this discussion it is necessary to be cautious with the rational values of @xmath95 in order to have a real value for @xmath2",
