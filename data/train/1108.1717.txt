    "one of the paramount and challenging goals of modern nuclear physics is to elaborate theoretical approaches with not only descriptive but also predictive abilities .",
    "this is of particular relevance for a proper description of nuclei far from the valley of stability since in this case only limited or no information is available .",
    "self - consistency between the mean field and the effective interaction is also known to be of prime importance for a correct exploration of the excitation properties of unstable nuclei .",
    "another fundamental ingredient of the model , known to be important even for stable nuclei , concerns the inclusion of more complex configurations than those traditionally included in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or quasi - particle rpa ( qrpa ) . here",
    "the most realistic approaches include complex configurations with phonons , i.e. the coupling of single - particle degrees of freedom with the phonon degrees ( the so - called phonon coupling or pc ) .",
    "these approaches are referred in the litterature as the quasi - particle - phonon model @xcite , the ( q)rpa+phonon coupling model ( ( q)rpa+pc ) @xcite and the extended theory of finite fermi systems ( etffs ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on the green function method and includes the single - particle continuum which is necessary for nuclei with a nucleon separation energy close to zero .",
    "it has been recently generalized to include pairing using the quasi - particle time blocking approximation ( qtba ) @xcite .",
    "these approaches have been supplemented by considering a self - consistent mean field , see for example @xcite , or the self - consistency between the mean field and the effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "the latter made it possible to perform the calculation with one unique set of interaction parameters , for example the skyrme force  @xcite , instead of two sets of parameters used in non - self - consistent approaches ( one for the effective interaction and another for the mean field ) .",
    "these improvements - taking into account the single - particle continuum and self - consistency- are of great interest , first of all , for astrophysics applications , but also for nuclear data evaluation .",
    "the added - value of such approaches lies essentially in their larger predictive power which provides an increased confidence in the calculation of structure properties for exotic nuclei , especially those with a large neutron excess and /or a small nucleon separation energy .",
    "however , one should note that all the approaches developed so far are in fact not fully self - consistent because , as it was noted earlier in @xcite , they use the self- consistency only at the ( q)rpa level and do not include more complex configurations into the self - consistency conditions .",
    "this is one of the main reasons to use some additional procedures to exclude ghost states , in particular , the spurious isoscalar 1@xmath9 state .",
    "this is achieved through a specific fit of the force parameters @xcite , the use of the so - called subtraction procedure in the qtba model @xcite or of the so - called `` forced consistency '' method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , accounting for the pc and self - consistency , beyond any doubt , increases the quality of the microscopic nuclear theory and is absolutely necessary to describe simultaneously the structure of ground and excited states for unstable nuclei .",
    "the role played by the pc in the description of the giant resonances _ in stable nuclei _ is well - known . in particular , the pc explains approximately @xmath10 of the observed width , its gross structure and sometimes some fine structure ( e.g. for the e2 isoscalar resonance in @xmath11pb @xcite ) .",
    "however , the direct influence of the pc on the giant resonance of unstable nuclei has been much less studied though it is expected to be as important as it is for stable nuclei .",
    "so far , giant resonance characteristics for unstable nuclei have been studied systematically within the ( q)rpa only ( for example , see @xcite ) and , quite recently , within a general approach based on sum rules @xcite .",
    "note that for the reasons given below , we will discuss in the present paper only the case of electric dipole resonance .",
    "the impact of the pc on the so - called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) , which lies in the low - energy tail of the e1 giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) and exhausts about @xmath12 of the energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr )  @xcite , is of particular interest .",
    "first , there is no consensus at present in our understanding of some important questions related to the pdr ( see @xcite and a recent mini - review @xcite ) .",
    "second , this resonance is known to have a significant impact on the radiative neutron capture rate of astrophysical interest  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the pdr is confirmed by the simple fact that it has been taken into account in all modern nuclear data libraries ( though at a phenomenological level ) in addition to the usual gdr @xcite .",
    "the question arises for exotic nuclei where the phenomenological approach may fail to provide a reliable prediction because of the specific features of the pdr in such nuclei and the scarce experimental data on which systematics is based . for this reason",
    ", a similar approach should be followed as for the giant resonance problem for unstable nuclei , i.e. , as discussed above , to use a reliable self - consistent theory which accounts for pc and the single - particle continuum in addition to the standard ( q)rpa .",
    "for all these reasons , the pdr problem has recently become a subject of intensive experimental ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and theoretical ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) studies .",
    "even if the total e1 strength of the pdr is small , if located well below the neutron separation energy , it can significantly increase the radiative neutron capture cross section , especially , for neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "different measurements suggest that some enhancement of the e1-strength could be located at low energies even on stable nuclei , a feature that can not be described within the ( q)rpa calculations .",
    "in particular , the large - scale qrpa calculations of @xcite predict pdrs which are on average 1 to 2  mev higher in energy than the observed values .",
    "many recent calculations of the pdr @xcite as well as the older ones @xcite performed within the non - self - consistent quasi - particle - phonon model confirm the need to take into account more complex configurations than those included in the ( q)rpa approach , most of all the 1p1h @xmath13 phonon or 2 quasi - particles @xmath13 phonon configurations . however ,",
    "large uncertainties in the description of the pdr ( in particular , its energy and strength ) remain , especially for unstable nuclei , and only sound microscopic models can shed light on its existence , as well as its relative importance and impact on neutron capture .",
    "for example , the self - consistent calculations with pc @xcite have shown that the complex configurations give a significant contribution to the radiative neutron capture cross section for the unstable @xmath2sn .    in practice , for a proper description of the pdr , at least two natural physical conditions need to be fulfilled : first , the energy of the 1@xmath9 spurious state must be equal to zero ; second , the theory must describe correctly the mean energy e@xmath14 of the e1 giant resonance . only in this case one",
    "may expect the theory to provide a reasonable quantitative prediction of the pdr integral features . in order to satisfy these two conditions",
    "different additional procedures have been used .",
    "the simplest way is to adjust the isovector and isoscalar effective force parameters to obtain the correct values of e@xmath14 and the spurious 1@xmath9 level energy  @xcite .",
    "this is suitable for stable nuclei for which e@xmath14 is experimentally available .",
    "for unstable nuclei , if use is made of a skyrme force and a self - consistent scheme without the subtraction procedure @xcite , it is necessary to modify some of the skyrme parameters to obtain an agreement with experiment @xcite . the first attempt to take the single - particle continuum into account exactly at the rpa+pc level using the green function method",
    "was made in ref .",
    "@xcite for magic nuclei .",
    "it was shown that a renormalization of the sly4 force was necessary to obtain an agreement with experiment .",
    "it is worth noting that this conclusion is in accordance with the studies of @xcite who considered this idea from a different point of view .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we realized a self - consistent version of the etffs(qtba ) using a discretized single - particle continuum with different kinds of skyrme forces including the sly4 one , where the velocity force is considered in a local approximation ( sometimes we call it dtba ) .",
    "the latter had consequences for the renormalization of the interaction in order to locate the spurious state at zero energy .",
    "on the one hand , it is of great interest to obtain a general information about the e1 strength function and correspondingly about the radiative neutron capture cross section for many neutron - rich nuclei using the well - known sly4 forces . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of the single - particle continuum along with the pc effects for non - magic nuclei is still a difficult problem . for these reasons",
    ", we use here our dtba approach to calculate the e1 strength function for the long sn isotopic chain .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we calculate the pdr and gdr in the long chain of the stable and unstable tin isotopes using the variant of the microscopic self - consistent version of the etffs(qtba ) which , in addition to the ( q)rpa approach , takes into account the single - particle continuum ( by means of a discretization procedure ) and phonon coupling in nuclei with pairing .",
    "for this part we concentrate on the description of the integral characteristics in order to gain an insight view into different trends for stable and unstable nuclei and to compare our results with the widely - used empirical formula .",
    "second , in order to investigate the impact of the pc on the radiative neutron capture cross section in stable and unstable nuclei we calculate them both with and without pc , within the same scheme of calculation based on the sly4 skyrme force or a slightly modified version of it . here",
    "our main attention is paid to the pdr and its impact on the radiative neutron capture .",
    "to date there are tens of different skyrme parametrizations serving slightly different aims and fitting some bulk properties of the ground state . here",
    "we use the sly4 parametrization of the skyrme force @xcite which proves to be rather successful in describing bulk properties of the ground state and some excited states within the ( q)rpa  @xcite .",
    "the ground states are calculated within the hfb approach using the spherical code hfbrad  @xcite . the residual interaction for the ( q)rpa and qtba calculations",
    "is derived as the second derivative of the skyrme functional  @xcite . in our calculation ,",
    "several simplifications are performed .",
    "namely , since up to now the qtba approach is designed to use the bcs - based quasi - particle basis , we use the hfb approach to extract the quasi - particle characteristics and corresponding wave functions , i.e. the occupation numbers are treated as in the bcs approximation . the spin - orbit residual interaction is dropped .",
    "the velocity - dependent terms of the skyrme force are approximated by their landau - migdal limit  @xcite though some physically sounder modifications are included .",
    "there are two kinds of velocity - dependent terms : the first one is @xmath15 and the second one to @xmath16 ( p - wave interaction in the momentum space ) .",
    "the averaged value over the density of the first term gives @xmath17 while that of the second one is zero .",
    "such an approximation violates the self - consistency and one has to correct the parameters of the residual interaction to put the spurious center - of - mass state to zero .",
    "we only change here the term which is proportional to @xmath18 by a given factor as we take this term approximately .",
    "this factor is usually around @xmath19 for the sn chain .    in general , the etffs(qtba",
    ") accounts for the single - particle continuum completely at the rpa level for magic nuclei and includes the new effect of ground state correlations caused by the pc  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the technical difficulties connected with the pairing specificity , these effects are not considered in the present calculations .",
    "the quasi - particle energy cutoff of 100  mev is used .",
    "we checked that within this approach the ewsr is fully exhausted ( for the case without the velocity - dependent terms ) and that the use of a larger basis did not bring any noticeable differences .",
    "the qtba calculations are performed with the same basis .",
    "we use 14 - 16 low - lying phonons of @xmath20 multipolarity and normal parity .",
    "they are obtained within the ( q)rpa with the calculated effective interaction using the same quasi - particle - energy cutoff .",
    "such a consistent method to calculate phonons is the reason for us to use a larger number of phonons than in the phenomenological etffs @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : st2 ] we test our numerical approximation of the single - particle continuum discretization for the @xmath2sn and @xmath21sn magic nuclei , by comparing our rpa results with the exact account for the continuum by the green function method at the rpa level  @xcite , as described in ref .",
    "it turns out that both calculations are almost identical which confirms that the discretization procedure adopted here is quite satisfactory .",
    "usually the gdr strength function is obtained from the experimental photoabsorption cross section which is fitted by a simple lorentzian functional .",
    "the e1 photoabsorption cross section is related to the strength function @xmath22 as follows @xmath23 where the photon energy @xmath24 is taken in mev , @xmath25 in @xmath26  mev@xmath27 and @xmath28 in mb .",
    "the lorentzian fit can be used to estimate the integral characteristics of the giant resonance  @xcite .",
    "the mean energy e@xmath29 , the resonance width @xmath30 and the maximum value of the cross section @xmath31 are extracted from the calculated photoabsorption cross sections under the condition that the three lowest energy - weighted moments of the lorentzian and of the theoretical curve should coincide in the considered energy interval . however , in order to obtain a more complete and universal information about the integral characteristics it is often better to use energy moments ( see below ) .",
    "this seems to be more appropriate for very neutron - rich nuclei where one may expect significant deviations from a lorentzian - like shape for the cross section . the same ( 0 - 30 )",
    "mev summation interval is used for all considered nuclei .",
    "the other feature of our calculation scheme is the so - called subtraction procedure @xcite which should avoid a pc double counting from the effective interaction .",
    "this procedure is a direct continuation of the phenomenological refinement philosophy used in the first formulations of the etffs @xcite .",
    "because the self - consistent relativistic ( q)rpa calculations are well fitted to experimental data and because the subtraction procedure , in principle , provides the correct e@xmath14 value , which is equal to the ( q)rpa @xmath32 value , the authors @xcite obtained a fulfillment of the above - mentioned conditions if the energy interval is properly chosen , for example ( 10 - 22.5 ) mev for z=50 nuclei or ( 10 - 25 ) mev for n=50 nuclei .",
    "however , altogether with a reasonable description of the gdr s width , the pc gives an additional strength in the low - energy region ( see figs.[fig : st1],[fig : st2 ] ) .",
    "so , this low - energy contribution of the strength is usually neglected in such an analysis of the integral characteristics based on the lorentzian fit .      here we discuss our results for the long chain of tin isotopes from @xmath33sn up to @xmath21sn .",
    "figs.[fig : st1 ] and [ fig : st2 ] show the strength functions for twelve sn isotopes . in the following subsections ,",
    "the dipole excitations are studied and the gdr and pdr analyzed along the sn isotopic chain .",
    "the general idea behind such an investigation is to understand if there are some common trends for dipole excitations in stable and unstable isotopes on both sides of the @xmath3-stability valley and if they can be described within one unique scheme and with one unique force like sly4 .",
    "one can argue that such a force may not be appropriate for unstable species but this force is among the most suited tool and can provides us with valuable theoretical findings , for example , as the non - lorentzian shape of the gdr for very neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath34sn , @xmath35sn ( see fig.[fig : st2 ] ) , as discussed below .",
    "fig.[fig : in1 ] shows the calculated integral characteristics of the dipole excitations for fifteen stable and unstable sn isotopes .",
    "the smearing parameter is @xmath36  kev for all calculations .",
    "the e1 response integral characteristics for the mean energies and dispersions are calculated using the standard definitions @xmath37 where the energy moments @xmath38 for the energy interval @xmath39 are calculated as follows @xmath40    first we check our approach on the stable sn isotopes ( @xmath41sn , @xmath42sn , @xmath6sn ) and obtain , as shown in fig.[fig : in1 ] , a reasonable agreement with available experimental data  @xcite . the dipole excitation for these nuclei",
    "has a well visible lorentzian - like form with parameters which may slightly vary depending on the adopted model  @xcite . though our results are not fitted by a lorentzian form and only moments",
    "are compared , it can be seen that we have a reasonable agreement for both the mean energy and the width of the e1 resonance .",
    "the @xmath2sn and @xmath43sn are the only unstable tin isotopes which were probed to study the gdr and pdr  @xcite .",
    "though the sly4 forces works quite well for stable nuclei there is no proof that it is good for unstable ones . in ref .",
    "@xcite along with sly4 skyrme forces we probed bsk5  @xcite and skm *  @xcite for @xmath2sn . in all the three cases we obtained very similar mean energy values and widths ( i.e @xmath44  mev and @xmath45  mev , respectively , for the sly4 force ) , while the experimental data are @xmath46  mev and @xmath47  mev  @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that other theoretical approaches ( see fig .  [ fig : in1 ] )  @xcite give very similar results which possibly means that further experimental investigations on the @xmath2sn gdr may be needed .",
    "our calculations show a noticeable difference both between ( q)rpa and etffs(qtba ) approaches and stable and unstable nuclei  ( figs .  [",
    "fig : st1]-[fig : in1 ] ) . the results for integral characteristics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : in1 ] ) clearly show the necessity to take the pc into account for a proper determination of the gdr width . for the @xmath48 nuclei ,",
    "the pc gives rise to an increase of the width by as much as 2  mev as compared with the ( q)rpa predictions .",
    "this pc effect is also important in @xmath5 nuclei though to a lesser extent .",
    "[ fig : in1 ] shows two distinct regions for the integral characteristics .",
    "the first region corresponds to the stable isotopes , @xmath49 , for which the integral characteristics follow the well - known phenomenological systematics ( e.g. @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "the second region includes unstable isotopes , @xmath5 , for which these systematics fail .",
    "similar conclusions for mean energies can be made out of the calculations obtained within the rqrpaz approach  @xcite .",
    "here we suggest another empirical systematics which describes quite well the mean energy in both regions defined above : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the neutron excess and the factor @xmath54 describes empirically the pairing gap , see @xcite .",
    "one can see that this is in accordance with the results in fig .",
    "6 ( see below ) .",
    "the first term is responsible for the collective gdr while the second one reflects the leftovers of the gdr , namely the non - collective particle - hole excitations .",
    "this formula reflects the fact that the mean energy depends on the superposition of these two kinds of excitations , while the degree of mixing is defined by the neutron excess @xmath55 .",
    "the second term becomes important for unstable nuclei and is correlated with the increased low - lying e1 strength . as mentioned above , the e1 strength can hardly be described by a lorentzian function over the whole isotopic chain .",
    "one may try also to separate out the gdr and pdr in the same way as done in  ref .",
    "@xcite using @xmath2sn as the benchmark in the definition of the border between these two resonances .",
    "this procedure is somewhat artificial and anyway for unstable nuclei the gdr centroid energy itself does not follow the systematics , nor does the mean energy taken in the whole @xmath56  mev interval .",
    "another interesting feature is that the dispersion  ( fig.[fig : in1 ] , lower panel ) is minimal at neutron magic numbers ( n=50 , 82 , 126 ) and maximal for open shell nuclei .",
    "likewise for the mean energy , the dispersion is quite close to the lorentzianian width for stable nuclei only , while the contribution of the low - lying tail to the dispersion for the second region is increasingly important with the increasing of the neutron excess .",
    "the division of the dipole excitation between the gdr and pdr regions seems rather artificial though the nature of the vibrations is rather different : the low - energy neutron and proton transitional densities are vibrating mainly in phase , while in the gdr energy region these are out of phase  ( see for example the case of @xmath11pb in ref .",
    "but there is no general rule for defining the interval of pygmy dipole excitations for a given nucleus .",
    "we can only visually outline the transition region between the gdr and pdr .",
    "we find that for the whole sn chain this region is rather well described by the 8 to 10 mev interval , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "[ st1 ]    this is why we consider here the @xmath57  mev interval for all the nuclei to get a general understanding about the low - lying dipole strength : the resulting mean energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : in2 ] , along with the rqtba  @xcite and rqrpaz  @xcite results as well as the experimental data available  @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with these two relativistic approaches as they are the only available calculations of integral characteristics for both the gdr and pdr in many isotopes of the sn chain and they have been obtained within a self - consistent scheme .",
    "it has to be noted that experimental data is available for @xmath60sn , @xmath41sn and @xmath6sn isotopes up to the neutron separation energy ( the low - lying strength is mostly concentrated in the @xmath61  mev interval ) while the `` pygmy region '' for @xmath43sn and @xmath2sn isotopes is not indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we obtain a reasonable agreement with experiment for the @xmath62 values summed over the @xmath61  mev interval ( fig .",
    "[ fig : in2 ] ) while the integral strength is a few times larger than the experimental value .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in other self - consistent calculations  @xcite , see fig.5 .",
    "we find some sort of agreement with the experimental @xmath2sn data ( for our @xmath57  mev interval ) which gives an integrated strength of the pdr of about ( 4@xmath633)% of the ewsr @xcite , while our calculation gives 4% with the pc included and 2% without . at the same time",
    "the calculated and experimental gdr mean energies are rather different and moreover the experimental mean energy is out of the general trend  ( fig.[fig : in1 ] ) . out of our self - consistent calculations for the sn chain and other non self - consistent calculations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that the pdr is very model - dependent and probably the force adopted needs some modifications for a simultaneous description of both the gdr and pdr .",
    "it is rather evident also that further experimental investigations are needed as well",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : trans]-[fig : in2 ] demonstrate that there is a distinct difference for characteristics of a low - lying strength for stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "namely , the pc contribution to the @xmath59 values , i.e. the difference between qrpa and qtba predictions , is small for nuclei in the @xmath5 region , while in the @xmath64 region the pc has a rather important impact .",
    "moreover , for nuclei such as @xmath60sn , @xmath41sn and @xmath6sn ( fig.4 , upper panel ) the pdr is almost completely defined by complex configurations in the @xmath61  mev interval . for the @xmath62 values",
    "we also have a `` border '' at @xmath65 : in the @xmath5 region there is almost no pc contribution and a decrease of @xmath62 , while in the @xmath64 region this picture is more complicated : the pc contribution `` corrects '' an a - dependence of the @xmath62 values which would be expected within the qrpa approach , and in this sense the pc effect is important .",
    "we find that the structure of the pdr excitation spectrum is very specific to each nucleus .",
    "it is hardly a collective mode and can not be described by some systematics like the gdr .",
    "for example , the goldhaber - teller model adapted for neutron - rich nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a rather smooth @xmath66-dependent behaviour for the pdr mean energy and its strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : in2 ] ) which is not predicted by our calculations and which is not really confirmed by available experimental data .",
    "this is easy to understand from the simple brown - bolsterly model for the ( q)rpa approach .",
    "indeed , in this model the excitation properties are determined by the structure of single - particle or single - quasi - particle levels .",
    "namely , the larger the difference between the neighbouring levels the more collective the appropriate ( q)rpa 1@xmath9-level . from this point of view",
    ", the collectivity is determined by the structure of single-(quasi)particle levels and , therefore , the pdr structure is rather specific to each nucleus .",
    "moreover , recently a thorough theoretical analysis on the pdr collectivity in @xmath2sn was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite which shows that the collectivity is rather weak and only a few particle - hole configurations contribute to the pdr .",
    "the authors demonstrated that such contributions are force - dependent and cooperative but not coherent .    in order to understand better the pc role in the pdr region for stable and unstable nuclei",
    "it is useful to consider the correlation between the neutron separation energy and the beginning of the low - energy excitation spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1e2w ] , we compare the neutron separation energy with the minimal particle - hole energy @xmath67 and the minimal energy @xmath68 ( where @xmath24 is the energy of the lowest phonon for a given isotope ) , which approximately determine the `` beginning '' of the low - lying tail for the ( q)rpa and qtba models , respectively .",
    "we see clearly that the smaller the neutron separation energy the lower the energy of the first 1@xmath9 level .",
    "one can see also a border at @xmath65 , i.e a direct correlation and similarity in the beginning of the spectrum within both the ( q)rpa and qtba for the neutron - rich isotopes",
    ".    due to the small neutron separation energy in the very neutron - rich sn isotopes a relatively strong low - lying tail of the strength function arises very naturally both within the qrpa and qtba  ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : st2],[fig : trans ] ) .",
    "so , there is no noticeable difference here between these two approaches . in contrast , for the lighter sn isotopes  ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : st1],[fig : trans ] ) a considerable contribution of the pc can be observed .    to conclude our analysis of the pdr , we consider transition densities which is now a standard way in investigating the nature of the nuclear excitations .",
    "recently this analysis was performed for some tin isotopes within the qrpa approach @xcite and within the relativistic qtba  @xcite . in fig.[fig",
    ": trans ] , we show our self - consistent qrpa and qtba results for the stable @xmath6sn isotope and the unstable @xmath69sn and @xmath35sn .",
    "we obtain a rather similar behaviour for @xmath69sn and @xmath35sn isotopes within the qrpa and qtba approaches : below 8 mev ( @xmath69sn ) and 9 mev ( @xmath35sn ) the proton and neutron transition densities are in phase in both approaches , i.e. both have an isoscalar character and are clearly dominated by the neutron contribution at the surface . at higher energies",
    "they show an isovector behaviour .",
    "globally , our results are in accordance with the qrpa results of @xcite for stable nuclei .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize some major differences between the qrpa and qtba approaches as far as the transition densities for the stable @xmath6sn isotope are concerned ( fig.[fig : trans ] ) .",
    "physically this corresponds to the fact that the pc gives a considerable contribution to the low - lying strength in stable nuclei , which can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : st1 ] for other stable nuclei .    in summary",
    ", we find that with the inclusion of the pc the low - lying tail is predominantly of isoscalar nature up to about 8 mev for all considered sn isotopes while the ( @xmath70 )  mev interval is a transition region towards the isovector type of excitation which distinguishes the gdr .",
    "we also conclude that the inclusion of the pc is necessary to explain the pdr integral properties ( including the integrated strength ) in stable isotopes .",
    "moreover it is mostly the pc that contributes below the neutron separation energy . for the @xmath5 nuclei , and especially for unstable neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the pc leads essentially to a redistribution of the pdr strength .",
    "the presence of the pdr in neutron - rich nuclei is of particular interest since , if located well below the neutron separation energy , it can significantly increase the radiative neutron capture cross section and affect the nucleosynthesis of neutron - rich nuclei by the so - called r - process @xcite .",
    "similarly , the presence of extra strength at low energy in neutron - deficient nuclei can be at the origin of an increase of the radiative proton capture or photoproton emission that take place on the left side of the valley of @xmath3-stability during the so - called rp - process or p - process , respectively @xcite .",
    "since such nucleosynthesis processes involve exotic nuclei that can not be produced in the laboratory ( at least on the neutron - rich side ) , only self - consistent calculations can provide a reasonable prediction of their electromagnetic excitation properties .",
    "the impact of our newly - derived strength functions on the reaction cross section are discussed below .      to estimate the impact our new qtba strength can have on the radiative neutron capture rate of astrophysical interest , the neutron capture cross section",

    "very recently , the results of the radiative neutron capture cross sections calculations within the self - consistent relativistic qtba were performed for the four tin isotopes @xcite .    since the electromagnetic transmission coefficient corresponds to an integral overlap of the de - excitation strength function with the nuclear level density , only the strength function in a restricted energy range below the neutron separation energy play an important role for the estimate of the radiative neutron capture rate @xcite .",
    "this range corresponds to @xmath8 energies of typically 2  mev@xmath734  mev though it may be higher in neutron - deficient nuclei or just before crossing a neutron closed shell .",
    "therefore if located in this energy range , the pdr might provide quite a large contribution to the radiative cross section . for neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the mean pdr energy is relatively low and the integrated strength high ( fig .",
    "[ fig : in2 ] ) , so that the pdr contribution may become significant @xcite .    here",
    "we consider three different compound sn nuclei , namely , the stable @xmath6sn one and unstable @xmath2sn and@xmath7sn isotopes . in our earlier calculations",
    "@xcite we used the microscopically calculated ( q)rpa and qtba strength functions which have been folded with a lorentzian in order to reproduce the expected width of the strength function .",
    "however , such a procedure tends to smear out the detailed structure of the strength function that may be of interest in the specific energy of relevance ( as discussed above ) . for this reason ,",
    "we consider here the realistic strength functions without any lorentzian folding .",
    "we consider two variants of the qtba calculations in order to compare the etffs(qtba ) calculations with and without  ( qtba - ws ) the subtraction procedure ( see the end of sect .",
    "iia ) . in the variant qtba - ws ,",
    "the isovector part of the calculated effective interaction strength @xmath74 is renormalized in order to bring ( in this approach ) the mean energy @xmath32 ( eq .  2 ) to the qtba predicted value , i.e to fulfill the condition @xmath75 .",
    "it turns out that the change of the @xmath74 value is no more than 10% ( more precisely 8 , 5 and 10% for @xmath6sn , @xmath2sn and @xmath7sn , respectively ) .",
    "we find that the difference between the qtba and qtba - ws strength functions is not large , both of them differing significantly from the qrpa predictions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rad1 ] ) .",
    "the differences between qtba and qtba - ws are essentially found in the redistribution of the strength .",
    "this effect is however large enough to impact the radiative neutron capture cross section as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad2 ] .",
    "in particular , fig.[fig : rad2 ] shows that the qtba - ws gives a larger cross section compared with the qtba for all the three isotopes although the gdr mean energies are the same for both variants .",
    "the comparison with the corresponding rqtba calculations for @xmath76sn cross section @xcite shows , in general , similar behaviour , except for specific energies like those around @xmath77  kev for which our cross section is noticeably smaller than the rqtba one .",
    "these deviations may stem from the specific structure of the strength function in the energy range of relevance , as well as from the use of different nuclear ingredients in the cross section calculation , such as nuclear level densities .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the microscopic strength function is folded with a lorentzian function , we found that for the stable @xmath6sn the cross sections obtained with qrpa and qtba were almost identical . comparing the qtba and qrpa strength functions  ( fig.[fig : rad1 ] ) and",
    "cross sections ( fig.[fig : rad2 ] ) allows us to deduce directly the role of the pc ( without any interference of an additional lorentzian smoothing ) .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the pc increases the cross sections by a factor 2 - 3 in the qtba - ws case ( fig .  [",
    "fig : rad2 ] ) . in the latter case",
    ", the cross section obviously follows the strength function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad1 ] , i.e. the extra low - lying strength is responsible for an increase of the reaction cross section ( and consequently of the maxwellian - averaged reaction rate of astrophysical interest ) by about a factor of 3 with respect to the predictions based on the hfb+qrpa calculation with bsk7 skyrme force  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the low - energy @xmath78 strength originating from the pc contribution increases the cross section at 0.1  mev ( an energy of relevance for the r - process nucleosynthsesis ) by about 30% for @xmath79sn(n,@xmath8)@xmath6sn for the qtba and by a factor of about 2 for qtba - ws . for the @xmath80sn(n,@xmath8)@xmath2sn",
    "these figures are even larger and for @xmath81sn(n,@xmath8)@xmath7sn we obtained a similar effect for the qtba - ws only .",
    "thus , in this section we demonstrated the noticeable sensitivity of the radiative neutron capture cross section with respect to the model ( qrpa , qtba or qtba - ws ) as well as the force used  ( sly4 , bsk7 ) .",
    "the lorentzian approach has been widely used for practical applications , though it suffers from shortcomings of various sorts . on the one hand ,",
    "the location of the gdr maximum energy and width remains to be predicted from some underlying model for each nucleus .",
    "for many applications , these properties have often been obtained from a droplet - type model or from experimental systematics @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : in1 ] , these estimate may differ significantly from the predictions obtained from sounder microscopic models .",
    "in addition , the lorentzian model tends to overestimate the @xmath78 strength at energies below the neutron separation energy .",
    "different parametrizations or functional forms ( including in particular an energy- and temperature - dependent width ) have been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite ) to reconcile experimental data in the photon or radiative neutron capture channels , but none of the proposed closed forms can nowadays explain the various trends observed at low energies . besides the lorentzian approach can not provide any predictions on the low - energy pdr , neither on its presence , nor on its characteristics . for this reason ,",
    "it is of particular interest to analyze to what extent our predictions based on self - consistent microscopic models differ from those used in practical applications .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad2 ] our results are compared with those obtained with the phenomenological generalized lorentzian ( glo ) strength function @xcite . for the stable @xmath6sn , the glo cross section is rather similar to those obtained within the etffs approach , to be exact , this cross section curve is just between the qtba and qtba - ws ones , although the strength functions can differ at low energies below the neutron separation energy ( fig.[fig : rad1 ] ) .",
    "however , for neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath2sn and @xmath7sn , the cross section obtained with the glo strength on the one hand , and both the qrpa and qtba , on the other hand , differ , especially for @xmath7sn . as shown in sect .",
    "ii , the main reason lies in the @xmath66-dependence of the integral characteristics , but also in the existence of a low - lying strength predicted by the microscopic models .",
    "note that the glo parameters used here for @xmath7sn correspond to the ripl2 recommended systematics , i.e. @xmath82  mev , @xmath83  mev and @xmath84  mb which strongly differ from our microscopic predictions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : in1 ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : rad1 ] also shows the spreading of the strength function down to the lowest energies , i.e in the vicinity of the neutron separation energy , while the glo model would only provide the tail of the gdr strength at these energies .",
    "these comparisons demonstrate the non - applicability of the empirical systematics and the necessity to make use of self - consistent approaches for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "( on the comparisons of m1 resonances with used systematics see ref.@xcite . )",
    "the electric dipole strength function has been estimated on the basis of the etffs(qtba ) model which simultaneously takes into account the ( q)rpa configurations , the more complex 1p1h @xmath13 phonon or 2 quasiparticle @xmath13 phonon configurations and the single - particle continuum .",
    "for the long chain of tin isotopes , the strength functions have been determined within our dtba approach which is a discretized self - consistent version of the etffs(qtba ) .",
    "the qtba strengths have been compared with the ( q)rpa ones which allowed us to study the contribution of the phonon coupling along the whole isotopic chain .",
    "our conclusions concerning the gdr and pdr properties clearly differ depending on the nuclear region considered , namely the @xmath64 and @xmath5 regions .",
    "more precisely ,    1 .   for neutron - rich @xmath5 sn isotopes , we find , both within qrpa and qtba , a significant difference in the a - dependence of the gdr mean energy with respect to the standard phenomenological systematics . our eq .",
    "[ eq : eph ] gives a new phenomenological systematics ; 2 .",
    "although for all considered isotopes , the pc contribution to the gdr width is very important quantitatively , its contribution to the nuclei of @xmath5 region is relatively smaller than it is for the @xmath64 nuclei ; 3 .",
    "the pc contribution to the pdr integral characteristics @xmath62 and @xmath59 summed over the ( 0 - 10 ) mev interval is small for the neutron - rich isotopes ; 4 .",
    "the transition densities in most of the low - energy region are mainly of isoscalar nature both within the qrpa and the qtba approaches .",
    "the pc contribution to the transition densities also affects the transition densities , especially in stable nuclei .",
    "globally , the isoscalar behavior is revealed on the energy interval considered here ( 1  mev ) .",
    "it is not found that the transition density of all individual peaks in the low - energy region is of isoscalar nature .",
    "we note also that for these reasons the qrpa can not explain quantitatively the isoscalar- .",
    "-isovector splitting of the pdr in the stable @xmath85ce observed in the ( @xmath86 ) reaction @xcite , see @xcite as well .",
    "such a different manifestation of the pc for nuclei with @xmath64 and @xmath5 correlates very well with the neutron separation energy .",
    "namely , the differences are much smaller for neutron - rich nuclei than they are for @xmath64 nuclei .",
    "just due to this fact the low - energy parts of the strength functions in neutron - rich nuclei are rather similar within the qrpa and qtba .    the radiative neutron capture cross sections for @xmath6sn,@xmath2sn and @xmath7sn were calculated with the qtba and qrpa strength functions and shown to be sensitive to the predicted low - lying strength .",
    "significant deviations from the phenomenological glo approach @xcite are also obtained for the strength functions , and consequently for the neutron capture and photoabsorption cross sections , for the very neutron - rich isotope @xmath7sn .",
    "a direct comparison between the qtba ( including the pc ) and glo cross sections shows that the neutron capture cross section on very neutron - rich nuclei may be increased by 2 order of magnitude with respect to the traditional use of phenomenological models .",
    "our results confirm the necessity to use self - consistent microscopic models when dealing with exotic nuclei .",
    "therefore , nuclear data libraries should not recommend such phenomenological models in this case , but rather point towards newly - developed microscopic large - scale calculations .",
    "the pc and single - particle continuum , which have been included , in addition to the qrpa effects , in our calculations , are necessary ingredients to describe the electric gdr and pdr properly . nevertheless , it is necessary to use some renormalization procedures ( either by adjusting some interaction parameters or applying the subtraction method ) to obtain the correct value of the spurious state energy .",
    "in addition , the approach still needs to include the self - consistency at the level of complex configurations .",
    "therefore , further developments are needed ( see also @xcite , where some unsolved issues in the pdr physics are discussed ) .",
