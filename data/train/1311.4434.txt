    "the quark model is very successful in explaining the hadron spectrum with simply using quark - antiquark mesons and three - quark baryons  @xcite .",
    "however , there are always multi - quark components in the fock - space expansion of hadron states  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is useful to properly include these multi - quark components if we want to use quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , to investigate hadrons in an exact way . besides these `` exotic '' components , multi - quark states themselves are also important in order to understand the low - energy behavior of qcd .",
    "these subjects have been studied for more than thirties years by lots of theoretical and experimental physicists  @xcite .",
    "particulary , the light scalar mesons are good candidates due to their tetraquark ( or molecular ) components .    the light scalar mesons @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 compose a flavor nonet whose masses are all below 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "although such mesons have been intensively studied for many years , their nature is still not fully understood  @xcite . in the conventional quark model ,",
    "light scalar mesons have a @xmath10 configuration of @xmath11 . however , because of their internal @xmath12-wave orbital excitation , their masses should exceed 1 gev and the ordering should be @xmath13  @xcite , which is inconsistent with the experiments . in chiral models ,",
    "light scalar mesons are very important because they are chiral partners of the nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "their masses are expected to be less than those of the quark model because of their collective nature .",
    "light scalar mesons are also considered as tetraquark states or molecular states or containing large tetraquark components  @xcite .",
    "considering the diquark ( antidiquark ) inside has strong attraction , their masses are expected to be less than 1 gev and the ordering is expected to be @xmath18 , which is consistent with the experiments .",
    "to study the multi - quark components of the light scalar mesons , we can use group theoretical methods , which have been applied to study quark - antiquark mesons and three - quark baryons  @xcite .",
    "t.  d.  cohen and x.  d.  ji studied the chiral structure of meson currents constructed using one quark and one antiquark fields and baryon currents constructed using three quark fields  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall follow their approaches and study the chiral structure of local scalar and pseudoscalar tetraquark currents .",
    "these tetraquark currents can be used in the qcd sum rule analyses  @xcite as well as the lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .    in our previous references , we have applied the method of the qcd sum rule to calculate masses of light scalar mesons using local tetraquark currents  @xcite .",
    "we systematically classified the scalar tetraquark currents and found that there are altogether as many as five independent scalar local tetraquark currents for each flavor structure .",
    "therefore , right currents should be used in order to study light scalar mesons .",
    "this is also closely related to the internal structure of light scalar mesons .",
    "a similar question for the baryon case has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where there are three independent local baryon fields of flavor octet .",
    "previously we chose some mixed currents which provided good qcd sum rule results  @xcite .",
    "although we did not know the relation of these currents with the internal structure of light scalar mesons at that time , we found that studying the chiral structure of scalar tetraquark currents can be useful to answer this question .    in this paper we shall try to answer this question (",
    "which currents should be used in order to study light scalar mesons ) .",
    "we shall systematically study the chiral structure of light scalar mesons through local tetraquark currents which belong to the `` non - exotic '' @xmath19 $ ] chiral multiplets .",
    "this chiral multiplet only contains flavor singlet and octet mesons , and it does not contain any meson having exotic flavor structure . since there are no experimental signals observing scalar mesons having exotic flavors , we assume that all the nine light scalar mesons ( or their dominant components ) belong to this multiplet .",
    "moreover , these nine light scalar mesons can together compose one @xmath19 $ ] chiral multiplet . to do a systematical study",
    ", we shall investigate both scalar and pseudoscalar tetraquark currents , since they are chiral partners .",
    "we shall also investigate tetraquark currents of flavor singlet , octet , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can be useful for further studies .",
    "we shall use the left handed quark field @xmath20 and the right handed quark field @xmath21 to rewrite these currents . after making proper combinations we can clearly see their chiral structures .    in this paper we shall use the method of qcd sum rule to calculate the masses of light scalar mesons through local scalar tetraquark currents belonging to the `` non - exotic '' @xmath19 $ ] chiral multiplets .",
    "one tetraquark current can be always written as a combination of meson - meson currents through fierz transformation ( @xmath22 ) , and so the two - point correlation function contain two parts : the disconnected parts @xmath23 and the connected parts @xmath24 in this paper we shall use both of them to perform qcd sum rule analysis . however , as suggested by s.  weinberg in his recent reference  @xcite using the large @xmath25 approximation : `` a one tetraquark pole can only appear in the final , connected , term '' , we shall also use ( only ) the connected parts to perform qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",

    "we write the flavor structure of tetraquarks , and study local tetraquark currents of flavor singlet and @xmath0 : @xmath27 there are two possibilities to construct a flavor single tetraquark current : both of the diquark and antidiquark have the antisymmetric flavor structure @xmath28 , or have the symmetric flavor structure @xmath29 . together with five sets of dirac matrices , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we find the following ten independent local tetraquark currents of flavor singlet and @xmath35 : @xmath36 in these expressions the summation is taken over repeated indices ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 for color indices , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 for flavor indices , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath39 for lorentz indices ) .",
    "the two superscripts s and @xmath44 denote scalar ( @xmath35 ) and flavor singlet , respectively . in this paper",
    "we also need to use the following notations : @xmath45 is the charge - conjugation operator ; @xmath46 is the totally anti - symmetric tensor ; @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) are the normalized totally symmetric matrices ; @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are the gell - mann matrices ; @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the matrices for the @xmath3 flavor representation , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "among the ten currents , five current ( @xmath53 ) contain diquarks and antidiquarks both having the antisymmetric flavor structure @xmath54 , and the rest ( @xmath55 ) contain diquarks and antidiquarks both having the symmetric flavor structure @xmath56 .",
    "we note that after fixing the flavor and lorentz structure of the internal diquarks and antidiquarks , their color structure is also fixed through pauli s exclusion principle , as shown in table  [ tab : singletscalar ] .",
    "the chiral structure of tetraquarks is more complicated than their flavor structure : @xmath57 the full ( expanded ) expressions are shown in ref .",

    "( [ eq : current11 ] ) , we use the left - handed quark field @xmath20 and the right - handed quark field @xmath21 to rewrite these currents and then combine them properly : @xmath62 from which we can quickly find out their chiral structure ( representations ) .",
    "for example , @xmath63 partly contains two left - handed quarks that have an antisymmetric flavor structure and two right - handed antiquarks that also have an antisymmetric flavor structure ; therefore , this part has the chiral representation @xmath64 , and its full chiral representation is just @xmath65 $ ] .    the results are listed in table  [ tab : singletscalar ] .",
    "there are four chiral singlets @xmath66 $ ] , two @xmath65 $ ] chiral multiplets , two @xmath67 $ ] chiral multiplets and two @xmath68 $ ] chiral multiplets .",
    "the @xmath65 $ ] chiral representation contains the nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons , and it does not contain any meson having exotic flavor structure . considering @xmath69 and @xmath14 are believed to be chiral partners in chiral models , we assume that light scalar mesons belong to this `` non - exotic '' multiplet , and we shall concentrate on it in our subsequent analysis . based on this assumption , we do not need to study other possible tetraquark states having exotic flavor structure . moreover , the current @xmath70 has the symmetric color structure @xmath71 , where color interactions between quarks and antiquarks are repulsive .",
    "therefore , it is questionable to use this current , but we shall still use it to perform the qcd sum rule analysis for comparison .",
