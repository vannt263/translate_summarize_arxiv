    "the results of this paper still hold for lattices which are invariant under reflection in one of the coordinate axes and under rotation around the origin by some angle .",

    "it is obvious that the resulting random graph of @xmath29-open edges has the same distribution as the one obtained by declaring each edge of @xmath31 open with probability @xmath29 and closed with probability @xmath32 , independently of the state of all other edges .",
    "the percolation probability @xmath33 is the probability that the origin is in the infinite cluster of @xmath29-open edges .",
    "there is a critical probability @xmath34 . for general background on bernoulli",
    "percolation we refer the reader to @xcite .    the first mathematically rigorous study of invasion percolation appeared in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the first relations between invasion percolation and critical bernoulli percolation were observed .",
    "it was shown that , for any @xmath35 , the invasion on @xmath36 intersects the infinite @xmath29-open cluster with probability one . in the case",
    "@xmath37 this immediately follows from the russo - seymour - welsh theorem ( see section  11.7 in @xcite ) .",
    "this result has been extended to much more general graphs in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the definition of the invasion mechanism implies that if the invasion reaches the @xmath29-open infinite cluster for some @xmath29 , it will never leave this cluster . combining these facts",
    "yields that if @xmath38 is the edge added at step @xmath20 then @xmath39 .",
    "it is well - known that for bernoulli percolation on @xmath40 , the percolation probability at @xmath2 is @xmath41 .",

    "suppose that @xmath45 is invaded at step @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 . following the terminology of @xcite , we call the graph @xmath48 the _ first pond _ of the invasion , denoting it by the symbol @xmath49 , and we call the edge @xmath45 the _ first outlet_. the second pond of the invasion is defined similarly .",

    "we review results concerning these relations .",
    "afterward , we will state the main results of the paper .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the empirical distribution of the @xmath14 value of the invaded edges converges to the uniform distribution on @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the authors also showed that the invaded region has zero volume fraction , given that there is no percolation at criticality , and that it has surface to volume ratio @xmath60 .",
    "this corresponds to the asymptotic surface to volume ratio for large critical clusters ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the above results indicate that a large proportion of the edges in the ipc belongs to big @xmath2-open clusters .",
    "very large @xmath2-open clusters are usually referred to as incipient infinite clusters ( iic ) . the first mathematical definition of the iic of the origin in @xmath61 was given by kesten in @xcite .",
    "we give this definition in section  [ seciics ] .",
    "relations between the iic and the ipc in two dimensions were observed in @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the moments of the number of invaded sites in a box was obtained there , and this turned out to be the same as the scaling of the corresponding moments for the iic .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that far away from the origin the ipc locally coincides with the iic .",
    "( we give the precise statement in theorem  [ thm1iic ] . )",
    "however , globally the ipc and the iic are very much different .",
    "their laws are mutually singular @xcite .",
    "the diameter , the volume , and the @xmath62-point function of the first pond of the invasion were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the decay rates of their distributions coincide respectively with the decay rates of the distributions of the diameter , the volume , and the @xmath62-point function of the critical cluster of the origin in bernoulli percolation .",
    "the diameter of the @xmath63-th pond for @xmath64 was studied in @xcite .",
    "it appears that the tail of the distribution of the diameter of the @xmath63-th pond scales differently for different values of @xmath63 .",
    "there is a rather complete understanding of the ipc on a rooted regular tree . in @xcite the scaling behaviour of the @xmath62-point function and the distribution of the volume of the invaded region at and below a given height",
    "were explicitly computed .",
    "these scalings coincide with the corresponding scalings for the iic .",
    "local similarity between the invaded region far away from the root and the iic has been shown .",
    "it is also true here that the laws of the ipc and the iic are mutually singular .    in this paper",
    "we study the sequence of outlets @xmath65 and the sequence of their weights @xmath66 . in theorem  [ thmtau ]",
    "we give the asymptotic behaviour for the distribution of @xmath67 for any fixed @xmath63 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "we compute the exact decay rate of the distribution of the size of the @xmath63-th pond in theorem  [ thmvolumes ] .",
    "this result can be also seen as a statement about the sequence of steps @xmath69 at which @xmath58 are invaded . in theorem",
    "[ outletmomentthm ] , we find uniform bounds on all moments of the number of outlets in an annulus .",
    "we use this result in theorem  [ outletboxthm ] to derive almost sure bounds on the number of outlets in a box @xmath1 . an important consequence of theorem  [ outletboxthm ] is corollary  [ outletsascor ] ; it states almost sure bounds on the difference @xmath70 and on the radii of the ponds .    in theorem  [ thmiic ]",
    "we prove the existence of an iic with several infinite @xmath2-open and @xmath2-closed paths from a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "we then show in theorem  [ thm2iic ] and theorem  [ thm4iic ] that the local description of the invaded region near the backbone of the ipc far away from the origin is given by the iic with two infinite @xmath2-open paths , and the local description of the invaded region near an outlet of the ipc far away from the origin is given by the iic with two infinite @xmath2-open paths and two infinite @xmath2-closed paths so that these paths alternate .",
    "last , in theorem  [ thmpivotal4iic ] , we see that the same description used in theorem  [ thm4iic ] applies in the setting of critical bernoulli percolation to the region near an edge which is pivotal for a left - right crossing of a large box , given that this edge is sufficiently far from the boundary of the box .      in this section",
