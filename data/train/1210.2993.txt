    "continuous and discrete representations have been reported , and it is easy to see how an increased number of states will start to mimic the  analog \" nature of continuously varying states ; here , of course , we are typically only interested in stable states .",
    "a simple  on / off \" switch , for example , is a binary representation or response mechanism ; this behavior is particularly interesting if there is a regime of conditions where the system can populate either state . in this case",

    "different cell fates may be differentially accessible and hence understanding the causes of multistability in signal transaction will have ramifications across many areas of modern biology , notably stem - cell biology and regenerative medicine .",

    "mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) cascades are the most popular exponents of this type of system@xcite . depending on the mechanism of ( de-)phosphorylation bistability in such systems can arise @xcite , which would give such systems the ability to use different levels of phosphorylation of the final substrate , _ e.g. , _ erk .",
    "this has been an area of growing activity in recent years , because of the important role mapks play in cell - fate determination .",
    "the ultimate function of erk is to initiate a host of transcriptional responses . to fulfill such a function , activated erk has to shuttle into the nucleus and a growing body of recent work is paying attention to such spatial aspects of signal transduction @xcite . here",

    "interestingly , the same effect has been observed at the onset of mitosis @xcite .",
    "very much like the physical address space in a computer processor @xcite , the biological equivalent is influenced by the ( bio-)physical organization of such systems . and here we show how the compartmentalization increases the number of stable states that can become simultaneously accessible , conferring greater flexibility and plasticity to such systems .",
    "importantly , spatial organization can induce multistability into systems that otherwise would be mono - stable , as well as ( sometimes considerably ) increase the number of states in systems where the presence of multiple - phosphorylation sites would already give rise to multistable behavior .",

    "this type of behavior may be limited to small regions of parameter space and in high - dimensional spaces ( our systems considered here have 20 and 36 parameters ( reaction rate constants ) , respectively ) it is likely not detectable by simulation or random search of the parameter space ; instead other approaches are called for . here",

    "the species abundances are modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations , which we analyze to determine if the system can exhibit multiple steady states ( multistationarity ) or not .",
    "this analysis employs a suite of different mathematical techniques , including the jacobian injectivity criterion and recent developments from chemical reaction network theory @xcite ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "when multistationarity can occur we thereby obtain corresponding values of the rate constants and the steady states .",
    "further , we delimit regions of the parameter space that contain all sets of rate constants that give rise to multistationarity .",
    "armed with these tools we establish that multistationarity can not occur if only one species shuttles ; if two species shuttle , then only the combinations @xmath18 or @xmath19 can induce multistationarity for certain total amounts and rates ; and increasing the number of species that shuttle maintains multistationarity ( see the appendix for a full description of the sets of shuttling species inducing multistationarity ) . the fact that the model includes the formation of at least one of the intermediate complexes @xmath10 ( and hence some form of sequestration ) is critical for the creation of multistationarity .",

    "shuttling plays a pronounced role in modulating the number of discrete states of the nuclear substrate concentration @xmath9 that can be realized : an increase of the shuttling rate constant causes the system to change either from a high to a low stable state ( for @xmath32 ) or _ vice versa _ ( for @xmath33 ) , with an unstable steady state in between ( fig .",

    "i.e. , _ the ability to map environmental states onto discernible internal states ( in particular of proteins active in the nucleus ) , are thus profoundly affected by the spatial structure of eukaryotic cells . in a biological context , a high and stable state of nuclear substrate ( @xmath2 ) can marshal robust responses to environmental cues . to add further flexibility to such information processing the shuttling speed of a substrate",
    "may further depend on the nature of the stimulus ; biological examples abound , and , for example , stimulated nih 3t3 cells shuttle mapk into the nucleus three times faster than starved cells @xcite . by simultaneously controlling the stimulus dose and shuttling speed",
    ", a nuanced transition to reversible bistability permits hysteresis , and thus introduces the possibility for switching between low and high stable states ( fig .",
    "trafficking is therefore more intimately related to cellular computation than is typically acknowledged and differences between cell lines in the shuttling rate constants of different substrates  _ e.g. , _ in nih 3t3 mouse cells , phospho - mapk can accumulate in the nucleus @xcite ; whereas nuclear accumulation does not occur in pc12 cells @xcite  may be hard - wired .",
    "alternatively , the rich set of mechanisms affecting both phosphorylation ( exemplary perhaps also for other post - translational modifications ) and trafficking give cells the flexibility to change their dynamical regime , _",
    "e.g. , _ from monostable to multistable , on the fly and in response to further environmental and physiological cues .",
    "the spatial / compartmental organization of cells thus drives crucial aspects of their information processing capacity ; notably the number and robustness of states that can be stably represented is higher ( or at least as high ) for spatially structured systems compared to homogeneous systems @xcite .",

    "* [ reactions2 ] consider now two copies of a two - site phosphorylation cycle as above and let @xmath106 shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm .",
    "the reactions describing the system are :    * reactions in the nucleus : + * reactions in the cytoplasm : + * shuttling reactions : +    the species are ordered as : @xmath107 @xmath108 assuming mass - action kinetics , the system of differential equations describing the dynamics of the concentrations of the species is :    @xmath109 this system has the following conserved amounts : @xmath110    * creation of multistationarity in a two - site phosphorylation cycle . * [ multi ] we use the crnt toolbox to obtain initial rate constants and total amounts for which the system admits multiple positive steady states .",
    "the output rate constants do not fulfill @xmath111 in each compartment independently .",
    "hence , it is not possible to decide whether multistationarity arises due to shuttling or due to phosphorylation of two different sites .",
    "next we investigate the effect of changing the rate constants with respect to the existence of multistationarity for the same total amounts .",
    "we proceed by manually modifying the rates while keeping multistationarity and such that the sufficient conditions for the preclusion of multistationarity in a two - site phosphorylation cycle are satisfied in each compartment .",
    "we end up with the following rate constants :    * reaction rates in the nucleus : @xmath112 * reaction rates in the cytoplasm : @xmath113 * shuttling rates : @xmath114    this choice of rate constants fulfills that @xmath111 in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm ( where in the later , indices of the rate constants in @xmath115 are shifted by @xmath116 ) .",

    "if the total amounts are set to : @xmath117 then the system has three positive steady states : two of them are stable and one is unstable .",

    "for instance , consider the rate constants ( used in the main text to create figures 4(b - d ) ) : @xmath120 and the total amounts @xmath121 .",
    "this system has 7 steady states , 4 of which are stable : @xmath122 the stable steady states are @xmath123 .",
    "as @xmath21 varies , the number of states changes as shown on a log - log scale in figure  [ f : loglog7statesetotvss2 ] , corresponding to the bifurcation diagram ( figure 4b in the main text , semi - log scale ) .",
