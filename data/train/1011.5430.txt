    "the principal initial motivation for study underlying this work was in our desire to benefit from onsager s theories of conductance of electrolyte solutions which should be quite relevant to various subjects in the fields of transport phenomena in plasmas@xcite , ionic systems@xcite and semiconductors@xcite and micro and nano systems@xcite consisting of electrolyte solutions and plasmas , since the conductivity and mobility of charged species subjected to external electromagnetic fields are of great interest regardless of the scales of the system size . at quick glance , one might think that onsager s",
    "theories@xcite on the subject matter appear dated at first glance , but the present authors believe there are some features that are still as relevant and significant even today as before . in pursuing this line of study we have learned that there are things of importance to improve on or extend in his theory of electrolyte conductance and new avenues to explore as improvement and extension unfold , as will be discussed in the course of this line of study .    in the study of ionic conductivity ,",
    "one is interested in currents carried by ions in solution subjected to an external electric field not necessarily weak . as the field strength increases",
    ", the conduction current has been observed to deviate from the ohmic law prediction .",
    "we in fact observe the well - known wien effect@xcite , which is a non - ohmic conductance of electrolyte solutions subjected to high external applied electric field@xcite that defy a linear theory description .",
    "currently , such non - ohmic phenomena are generally observed , for example , in semiconductors@xcite and expected to be operative in micro and nanosystems because of the necessarily large field gradients in such systems .",
    "onsager s theory is judged to provide valuable insights despite the differences in the sizes and states of aggregation of the systems and hence worth a serious study .",
    "the general ideas underlying conductance in ionic solutions , which originally was onsagers@xcite , consist of two effects : one is the electrophoretic effect and the other the relaxation time effect",
    ". these can be heuristically and qualitatively understood as follows : let the force on ion @xmath0 be @xmath1 with @xmath2 denoting the external electric field and @xmath3 the charge of ion @xmath0 .",
    "the ion of charge @xmath3 in the solution will possess an ionic atmosphere of charge @xmath4 , and this atmosphere will be subjected to a force of @xmath5 .",
    "this force will tend to move the atmosphere in the direction of force @xmath5 , while the central ion @xmath0 will be carried in the medium in a direction opposite to the motion of ion atmosphere .",
    "the velocity of this _ countercurrent _ may be readily calculated if it is assumed that the entire charge @xmath4 of the atmosphere is distributed in a spherical shell of radius @xmath6 from the central ion and that the motion of this sphere is governed by the stokes law@xcite holding for the motion of a sphere in a viscous fluid .",
    "thus , this velocity of the countercurrent is estimated to be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the velocity of the interior of the shell and @xmath9 is the viscosity of the medium .",
    "we are thus led to the result that the medium in the interior of the shell will be travelling with this velocity , and that the central ion will migrate against a current of this magnitude .",
    "the deduction of this expression qualitatively elucidates the most important part of the effect of electrophoresis .",
    "one may improve upon it by means of a hydrodynamic method using the navier ",
    "stokes equations .",
    "the second effect is : if the central ion possessed no atmosphere it would migrate with a velocity @xmath10(@xmath11 friction constant ) , but owing to its atmosphere , the ion is subjected to a force , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the force arising from the dissymmetry of the ion atmosphere created by the movement of the ion , and hence it will move with a velocity , relative to its environment , of a magnitude , @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the net velocity @xmath15 of ion @xmath0 is given by@xmath16 for the case of electrical conduction , we obtain@xmath17 here @xmath18 represents the relaxation time effect .",
    "the aforementioned two effects underlie a qualitative explanation of the electrophoretic and relaxation time effects in conduction .    the onsager ",
    "wilson ( ow ) theory@xcite is a theory of conductance of strong binary electrolyte solutions in an externally applied electric field . it formally calculates the ionic conductances by using the onsager ",
    "fuoss ( of ) equations@xcite for distribution functions  and the poisson equation@xcite for the modification of the field @xmath13 by the presence of the ion atmosphere and , in addition to the aforementioned two equations , the navier  stokes ( ns ) equation@xcite  more precisely , stokes equation  for the velocity of the medium to calculate the electrophoretic effect .",
    "henceforth the ns equation refers to the stokes equation in this article . for the ns equation the local body force arising from the external electric field and many - body effects",
    "must be calculated from the statistical mechanics ( kinetic theory ) of electrolyte solutions . in the ow theory the local body force",
    "is calculated from the solutions of the of and poisson equations .",
    "the of equations are coupled differential equations for pair distribution functions of ions in the electrolyte solution , which are fokker ",
    "planck type equations for ions moving like brownian particles in the solution subjected to an electric field .",
    "it is useful to note that , although the of equations were originally assumed on physical grounds they can be derived by means of the kinetic theory of dense fluids if a brownian motion model is assumed and the many - particle distribution function  is suitably approximated@xcite .    in his 1936 yale university dissertation under the supervision of l. onsager ,",
    "w. s. wilson@xcite presented a formal solution for the ns equation obtained by means of the method of fourier transforms with the local body force determined from the of and poisson equations .",
    "the formal solution consists of sine and cosine transforms of rather complicated functions . since the external field is assumed directed in the positive @xmath19 direction of the coordinate system and there is an axial symmetry around the @xmath19 axis , the natural coordinates are cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath19 is the axis@xmath21of the cylinder , @xmath22 is the radial coordinate perpendicular to the cylinder axis , and @xmath23 is the azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath19 axis ",
    "parallel to the field direction .",
    "see fig . 1 for the coordinates defined .",
    "the solution therefore is axially symmetric and hence does not depend on angle @xmath23 .",
    "the formal fourier transform solution for the ns equation obtained thereby , however , must be more explicitly calculated as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath22 to make further progress in theory .",
    "unfortunately , the fourier transform solution is not a kind that can be easily evaluated in elementary functions since it consists of rather complicated integrals .",
    "wilson considered a special case of position coordinates for evaluation of the fourier transform solution .",
    "since the ion @xmath0 of ion atmosphere is the object of attention and is assumed located at the center of the ion atmosphere , which is taken to be at the coordinate origin , he sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the integrals making up the solution , which then become amenable to exact and analytic evaluations .",
    "but there is one integral among them that clearly gives rise to divergence making the choice of @xmath24 and @xmath25 inappropriate .",
    "_ despite his argument to the effect that it does not contribute to the solution because its contour integral vanishes _ , it is reasonable to say in retrospect that he simply discarded the divergent term and retained only the convergent integrals for the calculation of electrophoresis .",
    "despite this troublesome aspect , the result of such a calculation was subsequently entrenched in the literature@xcite on conductance of electrolyte solutions , especially , in connection with the wien effect on the ionic conductance .",
    "we find that , mathematically , this difficulty arises because the some of the integrals involved in the fourier transform solution are not uniformly convergent for all values of the position coordinates .",
    "for this reason it is not possible to set @xmath24 and @xmath25 in some of the integrals before their integrations are fully performed .",
    "we , in fact , will find that , when exactly evaluated , some of the integrals give rise to functions diverging as @xmath19 and @xmath22 approach to the coordinate origin . in other words ,",
    "the solution of the ns equation for the velocity is inherently singular at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "it then becomes crucially important to re - examine the ow theory to get around this difficulty and suitably revise it before making use of it to interpret experiments on conductance , because there arises the question of what is really meant by the electrophoretic effect and conductance calculated therewith , given a velocity distribution that depends on @xmath19 and @xmath22 and is manifestly divergent as @xmath19 , @xmath26 .",
    "in this work , we avoid wilson s procedure@xcite of setting @xmath24 and @xmath25 within the integrals before they are evaluated , yet manage to completely evaluate them analytically or reduce them to easily computable quadratures .",
    "thus we obtain relatively much simpler velocity formulas than the fourier transform solution that explicitly depend on @xmath19 and @xmath22 as well as the field strength , for the axial and transversal velocities and the nonequilibrium part of pressure nonlinearly depending on the external field strength . as a matter of fact",
    ", the results obtained for the velocities and pressure appear to be rare examples for the solutions of the ns equation of a fluid ( e.g. , electrolytes ) in an external electric field when the flow is laminar that is applicable to practical experimental situations .",
    "the velocity profiles obtained display the manner in which the ions move in the applied electric field , and there is much insight to be gained with regard to the mode of ionic conduction in electrolyte solutions . in the sequels to this work , we will investigate its application to studies of ionic conductance and other transport processes in ionic solutions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the formal ( fourier transform ) solutions of the of equations for pair distribution functions and the poisson equations for potentials are briefly reviewed to provide the basis for the local body force  an electric field in the present case  that is necessary for the ns equation for velocity of the electrolyte solution in an external electric field .",
    "the solutions of the of and poisson equations are those of wilson s in his dissertation , which have been also presented in a recent tutorial review article@xcite by one of the present authors . in sec iii ,",
    "the solution of such an ns equation was formally solved in the same manner as by wilson .",
    "we repeat his formal solution procedure , because his work has never been published , only a brief summary of the pertinent results having been given in the monograph of harned and owen@xcite and in the review article by eckstrom and schmeltzer@xcite .",
    "his thesis@xcite itself not only skips details of the solution procedures used , making it difficult to follow , but also contains some errors , typographical or otherwise , in some important steps and results .",
    "moreover , as mentioned earlier , some of the integrals making up the formal solution diverge at the origin of the coordinate system , causing difficulty to ascertain the true nature and meaning of the electrophoretic effect deduced in his dissertation . for this reason , in this work we will solve the ns equation afresh , which by itself is quite worthwhile to learn about for its pedagogical value for those not well versed in fluid dynamics of ionic solutions . in sec .",
    "iv , the formal solution consisting of a number of fourier transforms of complicated integrands including bessel functions@xcite of complicated arguments will be explicitly evaluated by using the method of contour integrations@xcite .",
    "we thereby obtain explicit velocity profiles as functions of coordinates and field strength for axial and transversal flows of the electrolyte solution in a coordinate system fixed at the center ion of ion atmosphere .",
    "therefore the velocity profiles are of the medium with countercharges and relative to the motion of the center ion at the coordinate origin ; this point should be remembered to avoid possible confusion about the motions of ions in the ion atmosphere under the external electric field . in the same section",
    ", we also calculate the nonequilibrium component of pressure which is consistent with the velocity  the solution of the ns equation  and depends on the field strength . in this section",
    ", we also present some numerical examples for the axial velocity profiles that qualitatively display how ions move under the external electric field .",
    "it reveals an interesting aspect of ionic flow in ion atmosphere subjected to an electric field .",
    "more detailed numerical analysis of the velocity profiles and their applications will be made in the sequels where the theory of conductance , transport as well as thermodynamic properties , and comparison of the theoretical result with experiment will be discussed . in sec .",
    "v , we examine how one might recover the electrophoretic effect of the onsager  wilson theory from the result of the present work .",
    "vi is for discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "the fluid system of interest here is a binary strong electrolyte solution subjected to an external electric field . in the of theory of transport in electrolyte solutions",
    "the evolution equations for ionic pair distribution functions are assumed to obey the of equations , which are essentially fokker  planck type equations@xcite in external fields of body force .",
    "these equations are coupled to the poisson equations for potentials of interaction between ions .",
    "this coupled set of second - order differential equations in fact provides an interesting and potentially productive approach to coulombic interaction systems subject to an external electric field that , in our opinion , has been overlooked in the fields of plasmas and semiconductors .",
    "the of equations are linear with respect to the potentials because the total force involves the assumption that the total field due to the ions and their atmospheres may be obtained by linear superposition of separate fields .",
    "onsager and wilson@xcite solved the coupled of and poisson equations by means of fourier transforms in a cylindrical coordinate system in which the electric field is aligned to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "it should be emphasized that linearizing of equations with regard to the force does not imply at all that the solutions of the coupled set of equations are linear with respect to the field strength .",
    "the assumption only ensures superposition of fields . in any case , it is the point of the onsager ",
    "wilson theory as far as the of equations for the ion pair distribution functions are concerned .",
    "the formal solutions obtained are formally exact .",
    "they can be employed to obtain the formal solution of the hydrodynamic equations for the velocity of the medium .",
    "however , the formal results are impractical to use for studying transport properties in electrolyte solutions , unless they are further evaluated more explicitly .    before presenting the solutions it is useful to note the symmetry properties of the distribution functions and potentials , which are made use of to construct the solutions .",
    "the indices @xmath0 and @xmath27 will be designated to stand for the positive and negative ion , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the relative distance vector @xmath29 between ions .",
    "the ion pair distribution functions are then denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 @xmath33 is the position vector of ion @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that for the nonuniform nonequilibrium system of interest the distribution functions are spatially nonuniform with respect to the position of ions , e.g. , @xmath32 in the case of @xmath35 .",
    "the potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 obeying the poisson equations also depend on the position @xmath32 of the ion @xmath34 and the relative distance vector @xmath38 between ions @xmath0 and @xmath27 . henceforth the position vector @xmath32 will be suppressed in the distribution functions and potentials for the sake of notational brevity .",
