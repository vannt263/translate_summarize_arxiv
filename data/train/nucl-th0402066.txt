    "<S> pacs numbers : 25.70.-z , 24.10.-i    * i. introduction *    recently , the study of the mechanism for heavy - ion fusion reactions at energies near the coulomb barrier , especially , the mechanism for the enhancement of fusion cross sections for neutron - rich systems has attracted a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the mechanism of the enhancement of fusion cross sections for heavy and neutron - rich systems is useful in the synthesis of superheavy elements . in heavy - ion fusion reactions , </S>",
    "<S> the excitation and deformation of projectile and target , neck formation and nucleon transfer strongly influence the dynamics of fusion processes . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are more pronounced at near and below the fusion barrier . for heavy systems , in order to consider these effects a very large number of degrees of freedom of motion is involved and the situation becomes very complicated . </S>",
    "<S> thus one will meet great difficulty by macroscopic dynamics models@xcite in which only few degrees of freedom of motion are included . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty is also encountered by the fusion coupled channel model@xcite for it is quite difficult even impossible to include such a large number of possible channels in practical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is highly requisite to develop a microscopic dynamical model suitable for studying heavy ion fusion reactions by which one can consistently take account of the dynamical deformation , particle transfer , isospin and mass asymmetry effects , etc . in our previous work@xcite , an improved quantum molecular dynamics ( imqmd ) model was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> main improvements in the imqmd model are as follows : the surface and surface symmetry energy terms are introduced in the potential energy part ; a system size dependent wave packet width is introduced in order to consider the evolution of the wave packet width ; an approximate treatment of anti - symmetrization , namely , a phase space occupation constraint is adopted @xcite . with this model we have studied the dynamical evolution of the fusion barrier as well as the development of the neck in fusion reactions of @xmath1ca+@xmath2zr . however , more tests of our model are needed . </S>",
    "<S> before that one of the most urgent problem has to be solved is to increase the time of keeping an individual nucleus to be stable and in a good shape ( close to ground state shape ) without emission of nucleons in order to study the dynamical process for fusion reactions of heavy nuclei . as is well know that the time scale for the formation process of a compound system in a fusion reaction of heavy nuclei is about thousands fm / c , and also the time scale of quasi - fission which reduces the fusion probability substantially in fusion processes of heavy nuclei is about several thousands fm / c or longer . to meet this requirement , in this paper we develop an updated version of improved quantum molecular dynamics model named imqmd - ii based on our previously work@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we mainly devote to modify the parameters of the potential energy functional in the model . as is well known that the parameters of the potential energy functional in the qmd model are obtained based on skyrme forces . </S>",
    "<S> there are quite a lot of new versions of skyrme forces having been developed following the development of the knowledge of nuclear equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the newly developed skyrme forces such as the @xmath3 series are designed to study the properties of nuclei away from the @xmath4-stability line in addition to nuclei along the @xmath4-stability line . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that these modern skyrme forces can describe the properties of the nuclei away from @xmath4-stability line better than the old skyrme forces@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore it seems to us to be worthwhile to try new parameters for the imqmd model based on the modern parametrizations of skyrme forces such as the @xmath3 series as well as the other popular versions .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we briefly introduce the formalism of the imqmd - ii model and the improvements . the applications of this model to the fusion reactions at energies near the coulomb barrier are reported in sec.iii . </S>",

    "<S> further development of the improved qmd model *    in this section we introduce the updated imqmd model(imqmd - ii ) in more details . </S>",

    "<S> then , we will give the new development of imqmd . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the calculation results about the properties of selected nuclei with the imqmd - ii model are given .    </S>",
    "<S> * a. brief introduction of the imqmd model *    for readers convenience , let us first briefly introduce the imqmd model . in the imqmd model , the same as in the original qmd model@xcite , each nucleon is represented by a coherent state of a gaussian wave packet @xmath5,\\ ] ] where , @xmath6 , are the centers of i - th wave packet in the coordinate and momentum space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 represents the spatial spread of the wave packet . </S>",

    "<S> the density and momentum distribution functions of a system read @xmath9    @xmath10    respectively , where the sum runs over all particles in the system . </S>",

    "<S> the potential energy density @xmath23 in the imqmd model reads @xmath24where @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the first three terms in above expression can be obtained from the potential energy functional of skyrme forces directly . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth term is the symmetry potential energy part where both the bulk and the surface symmetry energy are included . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we introduce an extra small correction term @xmath26 ( named tau term ) in the potential energy functional . inserting expression ( 13 ) into ( 12 ) , we obtain the local interaction potential energy omitting self - energies : @xmath27where @xmath28 ,   \\label{15}\\]]@xmath29and @xmath30 for protons and @xmath31 for neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that the third term in ( 14 ) comes from both surface term and the correction to the second term of ( 13)(see@xcite ) , and thus @xmath32 is actually treated as a parameter in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb energy can be written as a sum of the direct and the exchange contribution , and the latter being taken into account in the slater approximation @xcite : @xmath33where @xmath34 is the density distribution of protons of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the collision term and phase space occupation constraint can also readjust the momenta , but the former plays a very small role in low energy heavy ion collisions and the latter only happens occasionally . the phase space occupation constraint method@xcite and the system - size - dependent wave - packet width </S>",

    "<S> the linear density dependence of the symmetry energy term is taken and the parameter is fixed by the symmetry energy coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> in table.1 we list the @xmath35 , @xmath4 , and @xmath36 parameters used in the qmd modelai91 and the corresponding values obtained from various versions of skyrme interaction@xcite . from the table one can find the parameters of qmd(hard ) is close to that of siii , and the soft one is close to skp .

    "<S> we show the static coulomb barriers calculated by the imqmd - ii model with parameter set of iq1 for @xmath49ca+@xmath48ca , @xmath49ca+@xmath46zr , @xmath50o+@xmath50o and @xmath50o+@xmath51pb in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the results calculated from proximity potential @xcite are also shown in the figures . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the coulomb barriers calculated with imqmd - ii are in good agreement with those from proximity potential@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58    @xmath59 in addition , the effects of the mass asymmetry of projectile and target on the static coulomb barrier are studied through calculating the static coulomb barriers for @xmath60i+@xmath60i , @xmath61cr+@xmath51pb , @xmath62s+@xmath63th and @xmath64c+@xmath65fm fusion systems which can form the same compound nucleus @xmath66sg . in fig.3 , </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves denote the static coulomb barriers calculated by imqmd - ii with parameters iq1 and the dashed curves denote the results from the proximity potential . from fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> one can get two points : the first one is that the results from imqmd - ii are in good agreement with those from proximity potential when two nuclei do not overlap too much in space . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity potential may not be able to give an accurate result at the overlapping region where the imqmd model is applicable . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the results for the overlapping region are more interesting , especially for the cases of heavy systems . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is that with the increase of the mass asymmetry of projectile and target ( from @xmath60i+@xmath60i to @xmath64c+@xmath65fm ) the height of the coulomb barrier decreases gradually and the capture probability should be enhanced consequently . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    * b. fusion cross sections *    in the imqmd model , we first create certain reaction events for each incident energy @xmath67 and impact parameter @xmath68 ( in tis work the number is 100 ) and then counting the number of fusion events , we obtain the probability of fusion reactions , @xmath69 , then the cross section is calculated by using the expression@xcite : @xmath70at a certain incident energy , the probability of fusion reactions , @xmath69 , decreases with the increase of impact parameter as shown in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the interaction between two nuclei decreases gradually from central collisions to peripheral collisions , and following it the probability for fusion reactions decreases and that for elastic scattering processes increases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath69 decreases quickly with the decrease of incident energies within the energy range interested in this work . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5 presents the evolution of the fusion probability with impact parameter at @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from the figure that the fusion probability falls when the incident energy decreases from 60mev to 52mev and for energies below the coulomb barrier , fusion events generally only occur at central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72@xmath73@xmath74    in fig.6 , we show the fusion excitation functions for @xmath49ca+@xmath48ti @xcite , @xmath75ti+@xmath75ti@xcite , @xmath49ca+@xmath2zrtimm98 , @xmath76s+@xmath77y@xcite , and @xmath78si,@xmath79cl+@xmath80zr @xcite at energies near the coulomb barrier , and the experimental data are also presented for comparison . in the figure </S>",
    "<S> the triangles denote the results of imqmd - ii with parameters of iq1 and the circles denote the experimental data and crosses denote the results of one - dimension wkb approximation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from the figure that calculation results of imqmd - ii for the fusion excitation functions are generally in good agreement with experimental data , which implies that our model is quite reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> now let us study the influence of the surface - symmetry energy term on the fusion cross sections , we show the calculation results of the fusion excitation functions of @xmath49ca+@xmath48ca @xcite at energies near the coulomb barrier without and with the surface - symmetry energy term taken into account in fig.7 . </S>",
    "<S> one can find from the figure that at incident energies above the coulomb barrier the fusion cross sections calculated under two cases are approximately equal , while at incident energies below the barrier the difference between two cases become obvious , and for this case the fusion cross sections without surface - symmetry energy term taken into account are obviously larger than the experimental data and those with surface - symmetry energy term taken into account can reproduce the experimental data well . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the n / z ratio at neck region is enhanced at the early stage for neutron - rich fusion process@xcite , which is driven by the symmetry potential . </S>",
    "<S> it lowers the fusion barrier and consequently enhances the fusion cross section . </S>",
    "<S> if only the bulk term is taken in account , the effect of the symmetry energy term becomes too strong at surface region and therefore a surface - symmetry energy term should be taken into account in order to reduce the effect of the bulk symmetry energy term at surface region . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially important for having a correct neck dynamics in neutron - rich nuclear fusion reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81@xmath82    for further testing the reliability of imqmd , we calculate the excitation function for fusion reactions of the neutron - rich radioactive beam @xmath44sn bombarding on the neutron - rich target @xmath83ni at energies near the coulomb barrier , which was recently measured @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.8 shows the comparison of our calculation results and the experimental data as well as the results from coupled - channel calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solid circles denotes the experimental data , the triangles denote the results of imqmd - ii with parameters of iq1 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed and solid curves denote the results of coupled - channel calculations with including inelastic excitation ( ie ) of the projectile and target and ie plus neutron transfer ( n&ie ) , respectively ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . from fig.8 one can find that the coupled - channel calculations significantly under - predicted the sub - barrier fusion cross sections@xcite . this is because with the coupled - channel model it is difficult to consider all degrees of freedom of motion , the number of which is extremely large in sub - barrier fusion reactions for heavier systems , while with the imqmd model , all degrees of freedom of motion are self - consistently included . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this model may possibly provide us with a useful approach to explore the mechanism of the capture process in the synthesis of superheavy elements . </S>",
    "<S> the work concerning this aspect is in progress and the results will be reported in the future work . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84    as a test we also make applications of our model to describe the charge distributions of fragments in multifragmentation processes . in fig.9 </S>",
    "<S> we show the charge distribution of fragments by using the imqmd - ii model with parameter set of iq1 for ca+ca at @xmath85@xcite and xe+sn at @xmath86@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can find that the charge distribution of fragments , especially the number of intermediate mass fragments is in good agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the number of intermediate mass fragments is usually being under - predicted in qmd model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our results are encouraging and it seems to us that the model can be used for heavy ion collisions at both low energies and intermediate energies .    * iv . conclusions and discussion *    in this work , we have made further improvements in the imqmd model and proposed a new version , namely , the imqmd - ii model in which a new small correction term and a surface symmetry energy term are introduced in the potential energy functional in addition to the terms adopted in the normal isospin dependent qmd model . a parameter set for the potential energy functional based on skyrme interaction of skm @xmath0 and sly series is introduced . by using the new version of the imqmd model , the ground state properties of a series selected nuclei can be described very well . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of individual nuclei can keep stable for about several thousands fm / c which roughly fits the requirement for study of fusion reactions of heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that with this model both the coulomb barriers and the fusion excitation functions for a series of fusion systems ( including neutron - rich radioactive beam @xmath44sn + @xmath83ni fusion reactions ) at energies near the barrier can be reproduced very well . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the microscopic dynamical model such as the imqmd model has an advantage of taking account of the dynamical effects such as the excitations of projectile and target ( deformation and vibration ) , neck formation , isospin and mass asymmetry , etc . simultaneously and </S>",
    "<S> thus offers a useful way to study fusion reactions of heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have also shown that this model seems to work well on the charge distribution of fragments in multifragmentation processes . </S>"
