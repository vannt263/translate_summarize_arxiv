    "lithium - ion batteries ( libs ) are the secondary ( rechargeable ) battery of choice for portable electronic devices due to their high specific energy ( energy per unit weight ) and energy density ( energy per unit volume ) .",
    "libs have the highest capacity of all the commercially available battery technologies and are now being deployed in hybrid and all - electric vehicles.@xcite there is substantial interest in enhancing the capacity of libs , driven by the economic and environmental advantages of increasing the range of electric vehicles , and enabling longer - life portable electronic devices .",
    "lithium intercalated graphite is the standard lib negative electrode material due to its good rate capability and cyclability , but demand for even higher performance libs has motivated the investigation of other materials .",
    "silicon is an attractive alternative since it has ten times the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of graphite ( calculated from the initial mass and volume of silicon ) but , unlike graphite , silicon undergoes structural changes on lithiation.@xcite the negative electrode may be studied using a half - cell containing lithium and silicon .",
    "the term `` anode '' applies to the negative electrode during lib discharge only , so to avoid confusion we refer to _ lithiation _ and _ delithiation _ of the silicon half - cell which corresponds to charging and discharging the lib respectively .",
    "the first lithiation of the cell at room temperature involves the conversion of crystalline silicon ( @xmath20-si ) into an amorphous lithium silicide phase ( @xmath21-li@xmath22si).@xcite the onset of amorphization depends on the lithiation rate and has been measured at @xmath23 in micron - sized ( 325 mesh ) silicon clusters after irreversible sei ( solid - electrolyte interphase ) formation has been taken into account.@xcite below a discharge voltage of 50mv the @xmath21-li@xmath22si crystallizes to form a metastable li@xmath24si@xmath2 phase which may become non - stoichiometric , li@xmath25si@xmath2 , at deep discharge.@xcite however , at temperatures above 100@xmath26c it is possible to form the most lithiated crystalline phase , li@xmath27si@xmath15 , electrochemically.@xcite full lithiation of silicon leads to a drastic volume expansion of 270280%,@xcite which generates considerable mechanical stress .",
    "hysteresis in the capacity / voltage profile occurs due to a combination of mechanical stress and different reactions taking different structural pathways on lithiation and delithiation .",
    "the microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still not entirely clear.@xcite @xmath21-li@xmath22si has been studied _ in situ _ using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) @xcite and electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels )",
    ". @xcite these studies along with _ ex situ _ nmr and pdf ( pair - distribution function ) studies of xrd data suggest that silicon forms small clusters and isolated atoms during lithiation .",
    "the clusters that form only break apart into isolated silicon atoms at the end of the lithiation process ( below 80mv ) .",
    "@xcite many of the disordered structures that form during lithiation can be approximated by the li - si ground - state and metastable crystalline phases .",
    "for instance , the crystalline phases have been used as a first step in understanding charge transfer @xcite and average lithiation voltages.@xcite to gain insight into the possible types of silicon clusters present and their environments in @xmath21-li@xmath22si , various crystalline phases have been investigated and categorized using nmr @xcite and _ ab initio _ theoretical techniques .",
    "@xcite these @xmath20-li - si phases have previously been well categorized using density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite however new insights into the most lithiated phases and the ability to synthesize li@xmath3si@xmath3 through ball milling have suggested that the system is far from fully understood .",
