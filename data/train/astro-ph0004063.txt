    "supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) are the prime distance indicators for the determination of the hubble constant @xmath18 since they can be followed out to large distances , and since it is possible to determine cepheid distances with hst for the nearest of their host galaxies and hence to calibrate their luminosity at maximum @xcite .",
    "this immediately yields the distances of the more distant sne ia because they are  if restricted to blue objects  the best standard candles known with a luminosity scatter of less than @xmath10=0@xmath725 . as standard candles they are now so heavily relied upon that they are even used for the much more sensitive test for the cosmological constant @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "a wealth of excellent photometric data for sne ia has been accumulated since 1985 by the caln / tololo team @xcite and others .",
    "they reach out to @xmath21 kms@xmath2 , i.e. far enough to avoid the effects of peculiar and streaming motions . in parallel ,",
    "the hst supernova project has by now provided cepheid - calibrated luminosities for six nearby sne ia @xcite , not counting sn 1895 b for which only the b magnitude is known .",
    "these are augmented by two additional calibrators from @xcite and @xcite . with a total of eight calibrators and three dozen more distant sne ia ,",
    "the statistics rests on solid ground .",
    "the one remaining question is whether the calibrators and the distant sne ia are genuine twins , or whether the different selection criteria cause systematic differences between the samples .",
    "for instance , the cepheid distances of the calibrators imply that they lie in galaxies containing young - population stars , whereas the distant sne ia have also been observed in s0 and e galaxies .",
    "various second parameters have been proposed to correlate with sn luminosity ; they can serve as a control of luminosity differences between the nearby calibrators and the distant sne ia . from the point of view of the physicist",
    "the most interesting second parameters are several spectral features which are known to correlate with luminosity @xcite .",
    "but the available data are too sparse to be useful in the present context .",
    "one is therefore reduced to empirical second parameters such as light curve shape , sn color , hubble type and position in the parent galaxy .",
    "second parameters have been discussed by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the difficulty to find a correlation between sn ia luminosities and the second parameters in face of an intrinsic scatter of @xmath10@xmath120@xmath725 is that very accurate _ relative _ distances are required .",
    "cepheid distances and , e.g. , tully - fisher distances are not sufficiently accurate for the purpose .",
    "sne ia in the virgo cluster can not be assumed to lie at the same distance because of the important depth effect of the cluster .",
    "regress must therefore be taken to the _ relative _ distances that are indicated by recession velocities .",
    "all velocities @xmath22@xmath51200 kms@xmath2 are taken as indicative of the relative distances .",
    "this is permissible because the errors assigned to the relative distances and to the resulting relative absolute magnitudes make allowance for reasonable values of the peculiar velocities ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss the correlation of second parameters with the peak luminosity of sneia  using an enlarged and well - defined sample of distant sne ia  and to determine the value of the hubble constant .",
    "the sne ia magnitudes , after correction for decline rate @xmath11 and color ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) , have a scatter of only @xmath10@xmath120@xmath713 .",
    "in fact the magnitude - corrected sne ia define the hubble diagram so well that a flat universe model with @xmath13=0.3 , @xmath14=0.7 gives a marginally better fit than an @xmath13=1 model .",
    "the corrected magnitudes , if combined with the corrected absolute magnitudes of eight cepheid - calibrated sneia , determine @xmath18 with a very small _ statistical _ error .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "the available data for blue sne ia are compiled , and their luminosity calibration by means of eight sne ia with known cepheid distances is discussed .",
    "the sne ia colors and extinctions are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the hubble diagram is shown in section 4 . in section 5 the sn ia luminosities",
    "are discussed in function of decline rate @xmath23 , sn color ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) , hubble type @xmath24 , and position in the parent galaxy . the effective hubble diagram with decline - rate and color corrected magnitudes",

    "the eight cepheid distances adopted in table 3 have been re - analysed by @xcite ( hereafter g00 ) .",
    "they have used allframe photometry and the associated method of detecting variable stars .",
    "they claim that this re - analysis places their galaxy distances on the same footing as the distances of galaxies contained in the mould - freedman - kennicutt ( mfk ; e.g. mould et al .",
    "2000 ) program .",
    "however , this claim is questionable for several reasons :    \\(i ) while the mfk team has consistently quoted photometry from allframe ( though dophot magnitudes have also been presented for comparison ) , their list of cepheids comprised objects independently detected by both allframe _ and _ dophot .",
    "the sandage / saha consortium have based their cepheid selection and photometry on dophot alone .",
    "a salient result of the g00 re - analysis is that the agreement of the photometry of stars that are _ in common _ between them and the sandage / saha team must be excellent , because if one compares only the 118 cepheids in common in six galaxies ( as given in table3 of g00 ) , the difference in the magnitudes averages to be @xmath53=-0@xmath7044@xmath190@xmath7002 , @xmath54=-0@xmath7038@xmath190@xmath7004 , in the sense that the allframe - based magnitudes are brighter .",
    "thus if the procedure that was actually used to derive distances by the mfk team in their program is applied , the agreement between allframe- and dophot - based magnitudes in @xmath4 and @xmath9 , and hence in moduli , is as good as one can expect , and the confidence in the dophot - based results is bolstered .",
    "however , g00 have added cepheids found only by allframe .",
    "these `` extra '' cepheids drive a distinctly different result , increasing the mean difference dophot - moduli ( of the sandage / saha team ) minus allframe - moduli ( of g00 ) to 0@xmath717 . had g00 reported results that are truly on the same footing as the rest of the mfk team analysis",
    ", they would not have seen the 0@xmath717 `` discrepancy '' .",
    "\\ii ) g00 specially point out that in the case of ngc 4536 saha s et al .",
    "( 1996a ) cepheids in chip 2 of the wfpc2 give a distance modulus that is larger by 0.66 mag , which is the result of differences in the photometry in v and/or i by order of 0.25 mag .",
    "g00 do not see this discrepancy in their own reduction : their photometry in all four chips are in mutual agreement , and also in nominal agreement with saha s et al .",
    "( 1996a ) photometry in chips 1 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "it is worth emphazising that the region of the galaxy imaged in chip 2 is different in character from that in chips 3 and 4 ( chip 1 is similar to chip 2 , but there are too few cepheids to make a statistically significant difference ) : the latter are dominated by the outer spiral arms , but chip 2 shows the more amorphous inner regions .",
    "such changes in environment can contribute different levels of confusion noise , and consequently result in mis - calibration of the zero - point . to be consistent with their work in other galaxies and having no external information on which chip is best , saha et al .",
    "( 1996a ) have combined their cepheids , as measured , in a single pl relation and have derived an average distance modulus , their rationale being that the exceptional chip - to - chip variation of ngc 4536 may just be the result of an unusually large _ statistical _ fluctuation .",
    "the point illustrates that the chip - to - chip variations of the aperture correction in crowded regions is the weakest link in wfpc2 photometry .",
    "cepheid moduli from the wfpc2 therefore always carry an uncertainty of 0.10 - 0.15 mag .",
    "the error is random from galaxy to galaxy and is therefore reduced by a sufficient number of calibrators .",
    "\\(iii ) the analysis of g00 differs also from the present one in the way the reddening is handled , both of the cepheids as well as of the sne ia .",
    "the g00 approach is to always de - redden the cepheids , and then to obtain the de - reddened modulus to the host galaxy .",
    "this approach is unavoidable if the extinction of the cepheids is much larger than that of the snia ( ngc4639 with sn1990n ) , if the cepheids have differential reddening ( ngc3627 ) , or / and if the sneia have large , but pre - determinded reddenings ( sn1974 g , 1981b , 1989b , and 1998bu ) .",
    "yet de - reddening procedures demand exquisite photometry , since the ratio of total to selective absorption amplifies the uncertainties in the photometry . therefore , instead of going through the de - reddening twice ( once for the cepheids and once for the sneia )",
    ", it is preferable to assume that the reddening of the cepheids and of the sneia is the same whenever the reddening is small ( @xmath120@xmath703 ) . in that case",
    "the sn luminosity is obtained by simply subtracting the apparent distance modulus from the apparent sn magnitude .",
    "this procedure has been applied for the first four entries in table3 .",
    "after the reddening corrections of g00 are applied , the `` discrepancy '' of 0@xmath717 drops to 0@xmath704 , 0@xmath707 , and 0@xmath715 , in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the consequence of this calibration then is  if applied to the fiducial sample  that the value of @xmath55 becomes larger by five percent than @xmath56 while with the present calibration in table3 the values of @xmath18 agree almost exactly in all three passbands ( cf . section 4 ) .    remaining systematic error sources , which may affect the calibrators ,",
    "are discussed in section6 .",
    "in table1 and in the following sections only sne ia with ( @xmath3-@xmath4)@xmath270@xmath720 , called blue sneia , are considered .",
    "this color cut needs justification . in figure1",
    "_ all _ sne ia between 1985 and 1996 with known peak magnitudes are plotted , unrestricted as to color ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) . the restriction to sneia after 1985 is here and in the following indicated because the advent of ccd photometry has much improved the photometric accuracy .",
    "the sneia colors are only corrected for galactic reddening .",
    "44 sne ia are strongly concentrated toward a mean color of ( @xmath3-@xmath4)=0@xmath702 with a scatter of only @xmath57=0@xmath705 .",
    "this small scatter is even the more surprising as hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996b , table 6 ) list an average observational error in color of 0@xmath706 .",
    "the _ true _ color scatter of this subsample could therefore be arbitrarily small .",
    "as far as spectra of this blue subsample are known they are all branch - normal @xcite , the only exceptions being the twins sn 1991 t and 1995ac with peculiar early specta . as mentioned before they are excluded in the following .",
    "the 10 sneia in fig.1 with ( @xmath3-@xmath4)@xmath50@xmath720 contain a high fraction of spectroscopically peculiar objects , like the very red and strongly underluminous sn 1991bg and the low - expansion velocity sn 1986 g and their counterparts , as well as some presumably strongly reddened sneia .",
    "these red sneia clearly form a very heterogeneous group .",
    "it is obvious that if sneia are to be used as standard candles , one must concentrate on the homogeneous class of _ blue _ sneia .",
    "even the sample of 42 blue sneia may be affected by some internal reddening .",
    "their true colors are best reflected by sne ia that have occured in e / s0 galaxies or lie in the outer regions of spirals .",
    "outlying sneia are here defined as having @xmath58@xmath50.4 , where @xmath59 is the radial distance from the center of the host galaxy ( in arcsec ) , and @xmath46 is the de vaucouleurs radius of that galaxy ( in arcsec ) . the @xmath58 values are listed in table 4 for all sne for which the necessary data are available .",
    "the relative radial distance @xmath58@xmath50.4 corresponds roughly to the limit to which the spiral structure can be traced .",
    "table 4 lists the mean colors @xmath0@xmath3-@xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath0@xmath4-@xmath9@xmath5 of all sneia in e / s0 galaxies , of the outlying sneia in spirals , and of the calibrators in table 2 .",
    "the three groups have closely the same mean colors , i.e. @xmath0@xmath3-@xmath4@xmath5=-0.012@xmath190.051 and @xmath0@xmath4-@xmath9@xmath5=-0.276@xmath190.078 .",
    "the overall means are therefore adopted as the true colors of sneia in e / s0s and spirals alike .",
    "@xcite have instead derived the intrinsic colors by assuming that all sneia with @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4)@xmath60@xmath00.06 are unreddened .",
    "( for their new method to derive @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4)@xmath60 see the original paper ) .",
    "they give @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) and @xmath37(@xmath4-@xmath9 ) values for 40 sneia with b- and for 32 sneia with i - magnitudes in their table 1 . if these color excesses are applied to the magnitudes in table 1 one obtains mean colors of @xmath0@xmath3-@xmath4@xmath5=-0.051@xmath190.007 and @xmath0@xmath4-@xmath9@xmath5=-0.331@xmath190.013 , i.e. noticeably bluer by @xmath610@xmath704 than adopted in table 4 .",
    "it seems therefore that the color excesses of @xcite are too large .",
    "the difference is not trivial when converted to absorption , i.e. @xmath62@xmath630.16 ; it has , however , no effect on @xmath18 as long as the adopted colors of the calibrators and the distant sne ia are the same .",
    "the question remains whether some of the sneia in the inner regions of the spirals , i.e. @xmath64 , are affected by internal absorption .",
    "figure 2 shows the correlation as to color ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) with radial distance for all sneia for which the necessary data are available .",
    "there are five inner sneia in spirals which are redder than ( @xmath3-@xmath4)=0@xmath706 . since their absolute magnitudes are also fainter than average they are strong candidates for some internal absorption .",
    "they are listed in table 5 together with two additional sneia that fullfill the same color and magnitude requirement , but for which @xmath58 is not available .",
    "the colors ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) and ( @xmath4-@xmath9 ) in columns 3 and 4 of table 5 are from data in table1 .",
    "these colors and the adopted mean color in table4 give the excesses @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) and @xmath37(@xmath4-@xmath9 ) .",
    "if these are averaged , giving double weight to the former and assuming @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4)=0.6@xmath37(@xmath4-@xmath9 ) , one obtains the mean excesses @xmath37(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) in column 5 , which in turn lead to the absorption - corrected apparent ( columns 6 to 8) and absolute ( columns 9 to 11 ) magnitudes of the sneia .",
    "they are on average close to the absolute magnitudes of the unreddened sneia . @xcite",
    "have given reddening values for four objects in table 5 ; they are also above average .",
    "the strongest argument for the internal extinction is , however , that at given @xmath11 they are fainter on average by 0@xmath738 in @xmath3 , 0@xmath730 in @xmath4 , and 0@xmath714 in @xmath9 than their unreddened counterparts ( cf .",
    "below , section 5.1 ) .",
    "this magnitude difference practically disappears once the extinction corrections have been applied .",
    "because the seven sne ia of table 5 being reddened can not be proved beyond doubt , they are excluded henceforth .",
    "if they had been retained without absorption correction they would slightly decrease the value of @xmath18 ; if included after the absorption correction they would not have a net effect on @xmath18 .",
    "it is reassuring that the remaining 10 sne ia in spirals , which have @xmath58@xmath00.4 or for which no information is available as to radial distance , have closely the same mean colors as the unreddened sneia ( table 4 ) .",
    "after the exclusion of sne 1991 t and 1995ac , and the i - band magnitude of sn 1992au , as well as the seven sneia in table5 , table1 contains 35 ( 29 of which have also i - magnitudes ) blue , unreddened sne ia after 1985 and with v@xmath51200kms@xmath2 .",

    "the scatter is somewhat larger within @xmath22=10000kms@xmath2 than beyond , which must be due to the influence of peculiar motions .",
    "the quoted values of @xmath8 are therefore upper limits of the intrinsic luminosity scatter .",
    "even the small scatter of @xmath72=0@xmath721 in the hubble diagram of the fiducial sample spans a total range of sn ia luminosities of @xmath610@xmath76 .",
    "this is enough of a variation to ask whether their individual luminosities depend on second parameters . if that is the case one must make sure that the calibrators in table3 have the same mean second parameters as the sne of the fiducial sample .",
    "even the sne ia with branch - normal spectra @xcite show some spectral variations which apparently correlate with the expansion velocity , the effective temperature  presumably a result of variable amounts of @xmath73ni produced in the explosion  , _ and _ the peak luminosity ( @xcite , cf .",

    "this illustrates the unique potential of sneia as distance indicators .    if the sneia of the fiducial sample are assigned the absolute magnitudes @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 of eight local sneia whose cepheid distances are known , one obtains closely the same value of @xmath18=58.3@xmath192.0 for the three passbands .",
    "this solution is remarkably robust against various assumptions and corrections .",
    "bootstrapping the calibrators by excluding two or three objects , does not change their mean absolute magnitude .",
    "the eight calibrators lie essentially all in spirals and they have correspondingly a somewhat smaller average @xmath11 than the fiducial sample .",
    "if they are adjusted to the latter s mean @xmath11 , @xmath18 is increased by 4 percent to @xmath18=60.9@xmath192.0 .",
    "a correction for ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) does not change this value because the calibrators and the fiducial sample have closely the same mean color .",
    "any remaining dependencies on hubble type and galactocentric distance are insignificant and have no effect on @xmath18 .",
    "alternative solutions considering either sneia only in spirals or sneia with small @xmath11  making the sample more similar to the calibrators  yields @xmath18@xmath6359 .",
    "the effect of systematic errors is mainly one - sided ( photometric zeropoint , skewness of photometric errors , the lmc zeropoint of the pl relation , selection effects of cepheids , and possibly metallicity effects ) , leading to too high values of @xmath18 .",
    "if they are taken into account one obtains at the 90 percent confidence level @xmath18=58.5@xmath196.3 .",
    "external results on @xmath18 from sneia should be compared with @xmath18=60.9@xmath192.0 from equation ( 12 ) , because the subsequent corrections for systematic errors have not been applied yet in other papers .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are indistinguishable from the above result despite of the re - definition of the `` fiducial sample '' here , of variations of other input data , and of independent corrections for @xmath11 and ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18=62(@xmath192 ) derived by @xcite from a sample of six calibrators and 13 field sneia in spirals and fully corrected for @xmath11 and ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) is in satisfactory statistical agreement with equation ( 12 ) , too .",
    "the somewhat higher value of @xmath18=63.9@xmath192.2 by @xcite , based on only five of the calibrators in table 3 , is fully explained by their adopted steeper luminosity dependence on @xmath11 , which is closely the same as was derived by @xcite , who included spectroscopically peculiar sneia like sn1986 g , 1991 t , 1991bg , and 1995ac . had suntzeff s et al .",
    "( 1999 ) @xmath23-correction been applied to our fiducial sample , we would have obtained @xmath18=59.7 for the sneia with @xmath11@xmath01.2 ( @xmath114=17 ) , and @xmath18=64.6 for the ones with @xmath11@xmath1101.2 ( @xmath114=18 ) . since seven of the eight calibrators fall into the first category the lower value of @xmath18 is more nearly correct .",
    "the 3-@xmath8 discrepancy demonstrates that their @xmath23-correction introduces an over - correction , making the calibrators with a small mean @xmath11 too faint and the field sneia with large @xmath11 too bright .",
    "this is the price to be paid if one attempts to derive a global correction formula which encompasses also peculiar objects that are extraneous of the sneia sample to which it should be applied .",
    " g00 have followed closely the line of @xcite , but they have reduced in addition the mean absolute magnitude of the calibrators by @xmath610@xmath72 on the basis of quite objectionable additional cepheids ( cf . section 2.2 ) ; their high value of @xmath18=68 ( based on six calibrators ) then follows by necessity .",
    "the repetition of one or two calibrating galaxies with the forthcoming advanced camera system on hst will bring a definitive decision on the merits of the additional cepheids of g00 , which were rejected here because their photometry relies so far only on allframe .",
    "@xcite have derived @xmath18=64.4@xmath195.4 from a sample of 42 distant sneia and only four cepheid - calibrated sneia .",
    "seven of these objects have not been used here as either being too red or having peculiar spectra ( sn 1992k , 1995ac ) .",
    "the sneia are standardized by a `` multi - color light curve shape '' ( mcls ) method giving simultaneously the absorption and a light - curve parameter substituting @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the individual data are not given , and the discussion is restricted to @xmath4 magnitudes denying a control on the consistency of colors . in spite of this , there is some question as to the grip of the mlcs light - curve parameter .",
    "the calibrators as well as the distant sneia have still a magnitude scatter of @xmath70=0@xmath716 after the correction , which is larger than @xmath8=0@xmath714 obtained by @xcite and significantly larger than @xmath70@xmath270@xmath713 found here by means of the corrections due to equation ( 10 ) .",
    "this discussion confirms previous investigations suggesting that if one attempts to derive @xmath18 from sneia to within @xmath1210percent , a major stumbling block are the second - parameter corrections .",
    "if the relatively mild @xmath23-corrections found here can be agreed upon it is clear that @xmath18 will settle close to 60 with a tendency for a small downward correction due to various ( small ) systematic errors .",
    "future branch - normal sneia in the field , preferably with @xmath22@xmath1153000kms@xmath2 , will help to settle the problem of light - curve shape corrections .",
    "the importance of these corrections will decrease as it will become possible to define sufficiently large sub - samples of field sneia which have the same mean second parameters as the calibrating sneia .",
    "additional field sneia are forthcoming @xcite .",
    "finally , the advent of the new advanced camera system on hst will allow to check the present cepheid distances and to increase the number of calibrating sneia .",
