    "the galactic globular cluster ngc 4833 ( @xmath4 ) is located in the constellation of musca inhabiting a dusty region near the galactic plane @xmath5 .",
    "figure 1 ( kohle & credner 2000 ) is an image of the sky showing the features surrounding ngc 4833 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that ngc 4833 is likely to suffer from spatially variable extinction .",
    "in fact , based on washington - band photoelectric photometry and high - dispersion spectroscopy of cluster red giants , geisler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and minniti et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , respectively , have suggested that the reddening varies significantly across ngc 4833 .",
    "this may be one reason for the dearth of ccd photometry for this cluster .",
    "samus et al . (",
    "1995 ) present the most recent color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc 4833 .",
    "their photographic study includes bv photometry of 868 stars extending from the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) to the main sequence turnoff and reveals a predominantly blue horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "accounting for their measurement errors , the dispersion apparent in the principle sequences of their cmd is likely to be a result of differential reddening .",

    "demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) identify 24 cluster variable stars including confirmation of 13 rr lyraes .",
    "the ccd photometry presented in section 3 extends @xmath10 magnitudes fainter than any previous study , allowing a first look at the main sequence turnoff of ngc 4833 .",
    "the data include photometry of the crowded central regions of the cluster unattainable in the prior photographic studies .",
    "in addition , we improve on the previous photometry by correcting the problematic reddening variations across the face of ngc 4833 ( sec .",
    "4 ) . as a result",
    ", we are able to make more precise measurements of cluster characteristics , such as the horizontal branch magnitude , reddening , metallicity and the age ( sec . 5 ) .",
    "an important by - product of our effort is the production of a reddening map in the region of ngc 4833 , which we can use to investigate the correlation between dust and extinction using observations from the iras and cobe / dirbe satellites .",
    "we begin with a description of the observations and data reduction .",
    "the data were obtained during two separate observing runs at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) . on the night of 1996 may 30 , using the 0.9 m telescope and the tek # 3 2048@xmath112048 pixel ccd , we obtained fifteen images of ngc 4833 in the b ( 5 x 120s ) , v ( 5 x 60s ) , and i ( 5 x 90s ) filters .",
    "the image scale was 0.396 arcsec pixel@xmath12 with a field of view of 13.5 @xmath11 13.5 arcmin .",
    "the telescope was `` dithered '' between exposures to minimize systematic errors from chip defects and flat field features .",
    "figure 2 shows a v band image of the cluster .",
    "standard star fields , drawn from the landolt ( 1992 ) list , were also observed .",
    "deeper images of ngc 4833 were secured with the ctio 4.0-m telescope , pfccd camera , and the tek # 4 2048@xmath112048 pixel ccd on the night of 1995 june 29 .",
    "the scale was 0.43 arcsec pixel@xmath12 .",
    "three frame pairs were obtained , each consisting of a 200 sec exposure in @xmath13 and a 160 sec exposure in @xmath14 .",
    "two short - exposure frame pairs were also obtained ( 10 sec in @xmath13 and 8 sec in @xmath14 ) .",
    "in addition the pointing of the telescope was `` dithered '' a few arcsec between each frame pair .",
    "tests showed that timing corrections for the iris shutter were unnecessary for images with these exposure lengths .      for the photometric reduction of the 0.9 m observations , we use a process similar to that employed by neely et al.(2000 ) ; a brief summary follows .",
    "we made use of the daophot ii ( stetson 1994 ) crowded - field photometry package .",
    "after initial runs of find and phot , we construct a preliminary point - spread function ( psf ) from @xmath15 40 uncrowded stars .",
    "we use the preliminary point spread function to subtract away the neighbors of the full set of @xmath15150 psf stars . from these",
    ", we construct a final psf which we use with allstar to perform profile fitting photometry for all the stars on the image .",
    "the psf photometry measures most of the flux from a star .",
    "we apply an aperture correction to account for any missing light .",
    "doing aperture photometry on @xmath15150 bright @xmath16 uncrowded stars , we calculate an aperture correction for each image , looking for spatial variations over the field .",
    "all fields had a constant correction except for one of the v images which had a correction that varied linearly with radius from the center of the image with an amplitude of @xmath30.01 mag .",
    "after editing the photometry using the image diagnostics output by daophot ( sarajedini & da costa 1991 ) , we combine the aperture corrected photometry for stars found in at least 3 of 5 frames taken in a given filter . using stars common to all three filters",
    ", we compile the bvi photometry list keeping only those stars with errors that do not exceed 0.1 mag .",
    "the final calibrated 0.9 m photometry ( see section 2.4 ) is presented in table 1 .",
    "the 4.0-m images were processed using standard techniques , including flattening with twilight sky flats .",
    "the fwhm near the center of the images was typically @xmath151.0 arcsec , but the image quality degraded radially from the center .",
    "we therefore masked off the regions of the chip outside @xmath156 arcmin from the center .",
    "photometry of stars within this radius was obtained using a version of the dophot psf - fitting photometry code of schechter et al .",
    "( 1993 ) employing a 2-dimensionally variable point spread function ( mateo , private communication ) . for each frame pair",
    ", we then matched the instrumental photometry of spatially coincident stellar images .",
    "the reduction of the 0.9 m standard stars and the presentation of the resultant transformation coefficients have already been discussed by montegriffo et al .",
    "we used selected stars from the 0.9-m @xmath17 photometry as secondary standards to transform the 4.0-m data to the standard johnson @xmath13 and kron - cousins @xmath14 magnitudes . to determine the nature of the transformation required",
    ", we plotted the difference between our instrumental magnitudes ( @xmath18 ) and the standard magnitude ( @xmath19 ) as a function of magnitude , color , and spatial coordinates ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "a weak , linear residual in color and a residual that varied quadratically in @xmath20 and @xmath21 were present , so we performed a photometric transformation of the form    @xmath22    where the coefficients @xmath23 were determined by the method of least squares using over 800 stars spread across the frame .",
    "the root - mean - square of the residuals was 0.03 to 0.05 mag .",
    "the corrections produced by the spatial terms were never more than @xmath30.08 mag and were less than @xmath30.03 mag within 3 arcmin of the cluster center . a simpler correction using only linear terms in @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "would not have improved the `` u''-shaped pattern of the residuals .",
    "one can think of the spatial terms as a quadratically varying aperture correction resulting from the radially varying image quality and the use of the spatially varying psf .",
    "photometry from the individual frame pairs was combined using an error - weighted average .",
    "the results are presented in table 2 .",
    "from the data in table 1 , we construct @xmath24 and @xmath25 cmds as shown in fig .",
    "3 . based on the width of the principle cluster sequences , the proximity of the cluster to the galactic plane , and the appearance of iras and cobe / dirbe maps of ngc 4833 we find strong evidence for differential reddening across the frame . in addition , non - cluster stars contaminate the cmd with a characteristic column occurring at @xmath26 .",
    "figure 4 gives the cmd for stars within 3 arcmin of the cluster center .",
    "the predominately blue hb morphology in conjunction with the relatively steep rgb indicate a low cluster metal abundance .",
    "figure 5 shows the deep @xmath25 cmd yielded by the 4 m observations in table 2 .",
    "two artifacts of our reduction procedure are seen in fig .",
    ", there is an overabundance of bright stars in the cmd due to the fact that the fainter stars are significantly incomplete near the center of the cluster .",
    "second , the splice between the short and long exposures appears as a discontinuity in the cmd at @xmath27 mag .",
    "taken together , these irregularities simply mean that we can not reliably use the cluster luminosity function , but the locations of principal features in the cmd are unaffected .",
    "our photometry reveals the main sequence ( ms ) extending to v @xmath1523.5 , or @xmath153 magnitudes deeper than samus et al .",
    "figure 5 also illustrates the cmd for stars between 1.5 and 3 arcmin of the cluster center , where we find the ms turnoff at v @xmath1519 .      with 528 stars in common ,",
    "we compare our 0.9 m photometry to that of samus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in fig .",
    "we find a mean v offset of @xmath28 , and a mean @xmath24 difference of @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , there are clear nonlinear distortions present in fig .",
    "we have seen similar behavior in previous papers ( sarajedini & norris 1994 ; sarajedini & layden 1995 ; neely et al .",
    "2000 ) when we compare ccd and photographic photometry .",
    "in order to correct for the differential reddening across the frame , we need a two - dimensional reddening map of the cluster . to produce such a map , we began by fitting a fiducial sequence to the blue hb . in the case of little or no differential reddening , hb stars will cluster tightly about the fiducial , spread out only by the photometric errors and evolution away from the zero age horizontal branch .",
    "the 0.9 m field was divided into square sections and a cmd was constructed for each section as shown in fig .",
    "7a and 7b . to ensure an adequate number of blue hb stars in each section , the squares around the edge of the frame are larger , @xmath30 arcmin , than the interior squares , which are @xmath31 arcmin .",
    "nonetheless , there is one square that contains no blue hb stars . for each square",
    ", we calculate the mean @xmath32 necessary to bring each blue hb star in the 0.9 m photometry onto the fiducial under the constraint that @xmath33@xmath13 = 3.2 @xmath32 .. this agrees to within the errors with other determinations of @xmath34 , which suggest a value closer to 3.1 ( cardelli et al .",
    "the results of our analysis do not depend sensitively on the precise value of @xmath34 .",
    "] this color correction is then associated with the ( x , y ) position of the center of each square .",
    "we use stepwise regression ( kleinbaum et al .",
    "1988 ) to fit the data with a polynomial of the following form @xmath35 where the ( x , y ) positions are given in pixels .",
    "the coefficients of the fit , which features a root - mean - square deviation of 0.019 mag , along with their associated errors are given in table 3 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 were not statistically significant and have been dropped from the fit .",
    "figure 8 shows our local reddening and extinction maps compared to dust maps generated by the cobe / dirbe satellite at 100 @xmath38 m and the iras satellite at 60 @xmath38 m as downloaded from skyview . while the large scale distribution of dust ( fig .",
    "1 ) suggests a higher reddening toward the galactic plane ( northeast ) , our map ( fig . 8a and 8b ) and the dust maps produced by iras and cobe / dirbe ( fig . 8c and",
    "8d ) suggest that the small scale reddening gradient is in the exact opposite direction .",
    "the reddening in our 13.5 arcmin field increases away from the galactic plane ( southwest ) .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "8 show the result of dividing our extinction map by the iras ( fig .",
    "8c ) and cobe / dirbe ( fig .",
    "8d ) dust maps scaled to unit mean .",
    "the latter maps are fairly coarse which means that the extinction pattern present in our map appears as a distinct remnant in the resultant quotient .",
    "however , we find remarkably good agreement in the overall shape between our photometrically derived extinction map and the aforementioned dust maps .",
    "the typical deviation is approximately @xmath310% .",
    "the agreement is maximized in the center of the frame and then deviates near the edges .",
    "our strategy in applying the reddening map to our photometry involves the application of a color and magnitude correction calculated using equation 1 combined with @xmath33@xmath13 = 3.2 @xmath32 and @xmath39 ( dean et al .",
    "this correction brings the photometry of each star in the field to the value it would have if it was located at the center of the cluster .",
    "figures 9 , 10 and 11 show radial cmd s of our 0.9 m and 4 m data before and after the differential reddening correction .",
    "all of the principal sequences are significantly better defined after the differential reddening correction . because these are radial cmds",
    ", we see the maximum improvement in the radial annuli that are furthest from the cluster center . in all of the subsequent analysis",
    ", we will make exclusive use of this differential reddening corrected photometry .",
    "demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) investigated the nature of 24 variable stars in ngc 4833 . based on an analysis of their light curves , they established or confirmed the presence of 13 rr lyrae variables .",
    "we have photometry for 11 of these stars ( table 4 ) , shown as circles in fig .",
    "all 11 appear on the hb .",
    "these stars give a mean hb magnitude of @xmath0 , in good agreement with the samus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) value @xmath40 .",
    "however , we caution that our v(hb ) value is based on only a few observations that do not properly sample the light curves of the rr lyrae stars .",
    "a proper ccd - based time - series analysis is required for a definitive value of v(hb ) .",
    "we have photometry for 7 of the remaining 11 variable stars studied by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) .",
    "one of these was listed as a ` red variable ' by demers & wehlau and the remaining 6 were of unknown type .",
    "these additional variable stars are plotted as triangles in figure 12 .",
    "we confirm that star # 16 , listed as a red variable , is near the tip of the rgb .",
    "star # 9 , unclassified by demers , is also near the tip of the rgb and may be another red variable .",
    "we find that the remaining five unclassified stars ( # s 3 , 7 , 12 , 15 , and 24 ) are located on the hb in the instability strip and are most likely rr lyrae variables .",
    "when we include the five additional rr lyraes , we find a @xmath41 , which is unchanged from our previous estimate .    because ngc 4833 possesses a predominantly blue hb and a significant population of rr lyrae variables , it provides an opportunity to test the fiducial hb technique used by sarajedini ( 1994a ) , montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and neely et al .",
    "the technique is used to estimate v(hb ) for a cluster with a negligible rr lyrae population but with a significant blue hb .",
    "it relies on the fact that the downward curvature of the blue hb is mainly a result of the increasing v band bolometric corrections at bluer colors .",
    "fiducial blue hbs of well - observed clusters with rr lyrae populations , are fit to the blue hb of the cluster in question .",
    "the expected location of the rr lyraes is then inferred from such a comparison . using a technique that is identical to that of neely et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we performed such a fit to the blue hb of ngc 4833 using fiducials from the globular clusters m15 ( buonanno , corsi , & fusi pecci 1985 ) and m79 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1992 ) in @xmath24 and m92 and m5 ( johnson & bolte 1998 ) in @xmath25 .",
    "the weighted average gives @xmath42 , which supports our value based on the cluster rr lyraes .",
    "we have applied the simultaneous reddening and metallicity ( srm ) method of sarajedini ( 1994b ; sarajedini & layden 1997 ) .",
    "the srm method is based on two empirically derived relationships .",
    "the first relates metallicity to the dereddened color of the rgb at v(hb ) and the second correlates metallicity to the difference in magnitude between v(hb ) and the rgb at a dereddened color of 1.2 . along with a polynomial describing the shape and location of the rgb ,",
    "these relations allow an internally consistent measurement of the reddening and metallicity . taking the average of the srm results in @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ", we derive a cluster metallicity of @xmath2 = -1.83 \\pm 0.14 $ ] , on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale , and a mean reddening of @xmath1 .",
    "these results compare favorably with those of menzies ( 1971 ) who obtained @xmath8 from a ubv two - color diagram and with the extinction maps of schlegel et al .",

    "first , there is the classical isochrone fitting technique .",
    "we make use of the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) models along with the rr lyrae distance scale advocated by chaboyer ( 1999 ) : @xmath44 + 1.6 ) + ( 0.56 \\pm 0.12).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to make the isochrone comparisons as differential as possible , we will also perform the same technique on the globular clusters m5 and m92 .",
    "table 5 contains the relevant quantities for the clusters in question .",
    "the values for m92 and m5 are taken from layden & sarajedini ( 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "figure 13 shows the isochrone fits to m5 and m92 while fig .",
    "14 displays the fit to ngc 4833 , where we have utilized the differential reddening corrected photometry for stars located between 100 arcsec and 180 arcsec of the cluster center . for all three clusters ,",
    "the unevolved main sequence is fit reasonably well by the isochrones , but the isochrones are systematically too red as compared with the data along the lower giant branch .",
    "this is not surprising given the fact that the mixing length parameter , which controls the efficiency of convective transport and thus the colors of these convectively unstable stars , is still a major uncertainty in the stellar models ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) . examining",
    "the fit primarily in the turnoff region suggests that m5 has an age of @xmath45 gyr , m92 is @xmath46 gyr old , and ngc 4833 is @xmath47 gyr old .",
    "the estimated uncertainties are purely internal errors based only on the scatter of points in the turnoff region and do not include possible uncertainties in the models or errors in the adopted distance moduli , reddenings , or metallicities .",
    "the age errors are substantial making it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion .",
    "however , in the next section , we investigate a more quantitative age determination technique .      in layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) , we used an age determination technique that relies upon the magnitude difference between the hb and the subgiant branch ( @xmath33@xmath48 ) at a point 0.21 mag bluer than @xmath49 .",
    "this is primarily useful when the turnoff region is difficult to define because of field contamination .",
    "originally , this age diagnostic was applied to the cmd of the globular cluster m54 , which suffers from contamination from field stars belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and bulge stars in the line of sight . in the present context ,",
    "it is useful to apply it to ngc 4833 because of the heavy contamination from galactic disk stars in the cluster s cmd .    using the ngc 4833 photometry shown in fig . 14",
    ", we construct a luminosity function centered at @xmath50 with a width of @xmath51 mag . fitting a gaussian to this distribution yields",
    "@xmath52 which then gives @xmath33@xmath48=@xmath53 .",
    "using the rr lyrae distance scale described above , we follow the technique described by layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) in order to parameterize age as a function @xmath33@xmath48 and metallicity . to effect this calibration ,",
    "we have utilized two different grids of models - the revised yale isochrones ( green et al . 1987 , ryi ) to allow a comparison to the age scale of layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) and the most recent girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 , giri ) isochrones representing the ` state of the art . '",
    "our results are shown in table 5 .",
    "we note that both the ryi and giri suggest that ngc 4833 is @xmath54 gyr older than m92 and m5",
    ". however , this conclusion is rather tentative until higher resolution imaging of the cluster core becomes available allowing the construction of a cmd that does not require such dramatic corrections for differential reddening .",
    "we presented ccd photometry for the galactic globular cluster ngc 4833 .",
    "the cluster is located behind a dusty region southwest of the galactic plane .",
    "interestingly , the local reddening increases to the southwest , away from the galactic plane .",
    "our reddening map is in good agreement with dust emission as measured by the iras and cobe / dirbe satellites with a maximum deviation of @xmath310% . after correcting our photometry for the effects of differential reddening we used the simultaneous reddening and metallicity method of sarajedini ( 1994 ) to find the mean reddening of the cluster @xmath1 and the mean metallicity @xmath2 = -1.83 \\pm 0.14 $ ] on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "the cluster contains 13 rr lyrae variables with confirmed periods . using the 11 rr lyraes available in our photometry , we calculated @xmath0 .",
    "five additional unclassified variables appear on the hb in the instability strip and are probably rr lyraes .",
    "finally , we used our main sequence photometry to determine an age for ngc 4833 relative to those of m92 and m5 .",
    "we found provisional evidence that ngc 4833 is 2 @xmath3 1 gyr older than the comparison clusters .",
    "a more definitive conclusion must await higher resolution imaging of the cluster core where the effects of differential reddening are minimized .",

    "<S> the cluster horizontal branch ( hb ) is predominately blueward of the instability strip with 13 confirmed rr lyrae variables and 5 additional rr lyrae candidates . using the 11 confirmed rr lyraes measured on our images , and the differential reddening corrected photometry we calculate @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the simultaneous reddening and metallicity method of sarajedini ( 1994 ) to find the mean reddening of the cluster @xmath1 , and the mean metallicity @xmath2 = -1.83 \\pm 0.14 $ ] . as for the age of ngc 4833 , we find provisional evidence that ngc 4833 is 2 @xmath3 1 gyr older than the average of m92 and m5 . </S>",
    "<S> a more definitive conclusion must await higher resolution imaging of the cluster core where the effects of differential reddening are minimized . </S>"
