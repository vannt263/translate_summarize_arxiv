    "one of the most important prediction of local supersymmetry ( susy ) , or supergravity , is the existence of gravitino , the spin-@xmath11 superpartner of the graviton .",
    "although the range of the gravitino mass @xmath0 can vary from a fraction of ev up to of an order of tev , depending on the scales of susy breaking , a light gravitino with @xmath12 ev is of great interest since it is free from the cosmological gravitino problem .",
    "furthermore , for some baryogenesis scenario to work such as thermal leptgenesis , high cosmic temperature is required , which favors the range of light mass for the gravitino .",
    "thus , in this respect , the light gravitino would be attractive .",
    "the determination of the gravitino mass is one of the most important issues to understand how supersymmetry is broken .",
    "some authors have discussed this issue , in particular , focusing on probing the mass of the light gravitino with lhc experiment @xcite . since gravitino with very light mass of @xmath13 can play a role of warm dark matter ( wdm ) in the universe , cosmology would be a powerful tool as well . some authors have obtained a constraint on the light gravitino mass from lyman-@xmath14 forest data in combination with wmap @xcite and its bound is @xmath15 ev at 2@xmath16 level @xcite data combined with updated wmap5  @xcite . although they did not report the constraint on the light gravitino mass , the sdss lyman-@xmath14 dataset would be more effective in constraining @xmath0 than the dataset adopted in @xcite .",
    "thus an analysis optimized for the light gravitino model could give a severer constraint on @xmath0 . ] .",
    "although lyman-@xmath14 forest can be very useful as a cosmological probe , it may suffer from some systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "notice that the above mentioned limit crucially depends on the usage of lyman-@xmath14 forest data , thus in this respect , another independent cosmological probe of the light gravitino would be of great importance .",
    "since light gravitino with the mass of interest here acts as wdm , it affects cosmic density fluctuations through two major effects .",
    "one is the change of radiation - matter equality due to the fact that light gravitions behave as relativistic component at earlier times .",
    "the second one is the effect of free - streaming which erases density contrast on the scale under which it can free - stream .",
    "since these two effects can make great influence on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , cmb can be a powerful probe of its mass .",
    "but in fact , when the gravitino is very light as @xmath12 ev , which is the range of the mass of interest here , its energy density do not have a large fraction of the total one in general to affect the cmb .",
    "thus the mass of light gravitino can be mainly probed through the latter effect , free - streaming .",
    "the ultralight gravitino is almost relativistic at the time of the recombination , its effects imprinted on temperature anisotropy is not significant enough .",
    "however , by looking at the gravitational lensing of cmb photons , we can well probe the change of the gravitational potential driven during the intermediate redshift after the recombination when light gravitino comes to act as a non - relativistic component .",
    "thus the lensed cmb is a very useful cosmological tool for investigating the mass of light gravitino , which we discuss in this paper .",
    "since much more precise cmb experiments will be available in the near future , it is an interesting subject to investigate possible limits with such a future probe .",
    "therefore , we in this paper study the possibilities of constraining its mass with future cmb observations without using other cosmological data . in particular",
    ", we focus on the lensing potential which can be reconstracted from cmb maps . as future cmb surveys ,",
    "we consider planck , polarbear and cmbpol to discuss a possible constraint on the light gravitino mass .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first briefly review a model which predicts light gravitino and its phenomenology in the early universe in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : cmb ]",
    "we discuss the effects of the light gravitino on cmb anisotropy , paying particular attention to the lensing of cmb .",
    "we then present forecasts for constraints on the mass of light gravitino with future cmb surveys such as planck , polarbear and cmbpol in section  [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "in addition to the parameter estimation , we also discuss bayesian model selection analysis for light gravitino model with future cmb surveys in section  [ sec : selection ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary of this paper .",
    "a light gravitino scenario is realized in the framework of gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite . in gmsb models ,",
    "the susy breaking effect in the hidden sector is transmitted to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector through gauge - interactions , giving superparticles tev scale masses . as an example , let us consider a model where the susy breaking field @xmath17 couples to @xmath18 pairs of messenger particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which transform as fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of su(5 ) , having a superpotential @xmath21 with coupling constant @xmath22 ( in the following we set @xmath23 for simplicity ) .",
    "the superfield @xmath17 has a vacuum expectation value as @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 gives susy breaking scale , which is related to the garvitino mass @xmath0 through the relation @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the reduced planck energy scale , for vanishing cosmological constant . in this model ,",
    "gaugino masses @xmath28 ( @xmath29 are gauge indices ) and sfermion masses squared @xmath30 at the messenger scale are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the gauge coupling constants , @xmath33 are casimir operators for the sfermion @xmath34 and the messenger scale is given by @xmath35 . in order to obtain tev scale masses , @xmath36  tev is required , but still the susy breaking scale @xmath25 , or gravitino mass @xmath0 can take wide range of values as @xmath37  gev .",
    "the upper bound comes from the requirement that the gravity - mediation effect does not dominate . on the other hand",
    ", there also exists a lower bound on the gravitino mass in order not to destabilize the messenger scalar and lead to the unwanted vacuum .",
    "this requires @xmath38 ev .",
    "however , if cosmological effects of the gravitino are taken into account , not all of its mass range is favored .",
    "this is because gravitinos are efficiently produced at the reheating era and it can easily exceed the present dark matter abundance unless the reheating temperature @xmath39 is very low @xcite .",
    "this is problematic since many known leptogenesis / baryogenesis scenarios require high enough reheating temperature which may conflict with the upper bound coming from the gravitino problem . in particular ,",
    "thermal leptogenesis scenario @xcite , which requires @xmath40gev , seems to be inconsistent with the gravitino problem except for the very light gravitino mass range @xmath41  ev .",
    "as we will see , gravitinos with such a small mass are thermalized in the early universe .",
    "thus their abundance does not depend on the reheating temperature and also it is smaller than the dark matter density for @xmath42  ev .",
    "this is the reason why we pay particular attention to a light gravitino scenario .",
    "having described that the light gravitino scenario is appealing from the view point of cosmological gravitino problem , next we briefly discuss thermal evolution of the light gravitino in the early universe .",
    "gravitinos are relativistic well before the recombination . in such a case",
    ", the energy density of the gravitino is parameterized by the effective number of neutrino species , and it is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) are , respectively , the energy density and the effective degrees of freedom of neutrinos ( gravitinos ) evaluated at the epoch when neutrinos ( gravitinos ) have decoupled from thermal plasma while they are still relativistic .",
    "in the standard cosmology , @xmath48 .",
    "temperatures of neutrino and gravitino are represented by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ng ] ) we can calculate the temperature of gravitino at present : @xmath51},\\ ] ] where we have adopted the temperature of neutrino in the standard cosmology at the second equality .",
    "eventually the gravitino loses its energy and becomes non - relativistic due to the hubble expansion .",
    "its present energy density is given by @xmath52 for later convenience , we also define the fraction of gravitino in the total dark matter density @xmath53 as @xmath54 in the following , we assume that dark matter consists two components : light gravitino , which acts as warm dark matter , and cdm . as cdm component , the peccei - quinn axion , a messenger baryon proposed in @xcite and so on can be well - fitted into the framework of light gravitino .",
    "thus in order to evaluate the relic abundance of light gravitino , we must know the value of the effective degrees of freedom of relativistic particles at the freeeze - out epoch , @xmath47 .",
    "since the production and/or destruction of the light gravitino due to scattering processes are known to be inefficient for the low temperature regime , in which we are interested , the gravitino maintains equilibrium with thermal bath through the decay and inverse - decay processes @xcite , schematically represented by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the standard model ( sm ) particle and @xmath57 is its superpartner .",
    "as the temperature decreases , particles in thermal bath ( @xmath56 and @xmath58 ) lose an ability to create a heavy particle ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "then gravitinos decouple from thermal plasma after the time when @xmath57 decays into @xmath56 and @xmath58 without inverse creation processes .",
    "in order to see these processes in detail , we must solve the boltzmann equation which governs time evolution of the system .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the gravitino number density @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath62 represents thermally averaged lorentz factor with @xmath63 and @xmath64 being the mass and energy of the particle @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "@xmath65 is the decay width of @xmath57 into @xmath56 and @xmath58 and superscript @xmath66 denotes its equilibrium value . as an example , the decay rate of the stau @xmath67 into tau ( @xmath68 ) and gravitino is given by @xmath69 and similar expressions hold for other particles . by solving this equation ,",
    "one obtains the final gravitino abundance which can be represented in terms of the gravitino - to - entropy ratio , @xmath70 and this translates into @xmath47 through the relation @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g ] , the value of @xmath72 is shown as a function of @xmath0 for several values of @xmath73 .",
    "we have adopted @xmath74 and @xmath18=1 and ignored running of the masses from the messenger scale down to the weak scale for simplicity .",
    "we can understand these results intuitively .",
    "as the gravitino mass increases , the decay width becomes smaller , and hence the equilibrium lasts for rather shorter duration .",
    "this leads to higher freeze - out temperature of the gravitino , which corresponds to large @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "larger @xmath73 leads to heavier sparticle masses , which obviously makes the time of freeze - out of the gravitino earlier , and hence higher @xmath47 .",
    "however , as seen in the figure , the dependence on these parameters are not so strong and we can safely set @xmath75 even if we take into account model uncertainties .",
    "in this section we discuss how light gravitino affects the structure formation and the cmb anisotropies .",
    "since light gravitino basically acts as wdm , it is characterized by two quantities , its mass and number density .",
    "the number density is determined by the effective number of degrees of freedom at the time of the decoupling , i.e. @xmath47 . since , as we have seen in the previous section , @xmath47 has only mild dependence on @xmath0 , we can take @xmath76 as the representative value , which corresponds to @xmath77 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ng ] ) .",
    "we assume eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidn ] ) as a fiducial value throughout this section , except for the last paragraph .",
    "we also assume that the universe is flat , dark energy is a cosmological constant and the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic and its power spectrum obeys a power - law without tensor perturbations .",
    "the fiducial values for cosmological parameters are adopted from the the recent result of wmap5  @xcite , except that we consider mixed dark matter scenarios @xmath78 , instead of @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the density parameter for cold dark matter ( cdm ) . by varying @xmath0 or @xmath81",
    ", we can see the effects of light gravitino on structure formation and cmb anisotropies .",
    "moreover , we assume that neutrinos are massless in the most part of this paper .",
    "we will make some comments on the case where massive neutrinos are also included in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "as briefly discussed in the introduction , the effects of wdm on structure formation can be understood by considering following two main aspects : ( i ) the change of the energy contents of the universe , or the epoch of matter - radiation equality ( unperturbed background evolutions ) , ( ii ) the erasure of perturbations on small scales via free - streaming ( perturbation evolutions ) .",
    "the first point is due to the fact that wdm behaves as relativistic component at early times but non - relativistic one at late times .",
    "thus it changes the time of matter - radiation equality depending on the mass .",
    "it alters the evolution of gravitational potential and drives the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect in the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "however , in the case of light gravitino in which we are interested , its abundance is so small @xmath82 that the epoch of radiation - matter equality is scarcely affected , even when we compare the two opposite limits , @xmath83 ( @xmath84  ev ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86  ev ) , with fixed @xmath87 .",
    "therefore it is almost impossible to constrain the gravitino mass from unlensed cmb anisotropies , even when the ideal observations ( cosmic variance limeted survey ) are available .",
    "possible constraints on the gravitino mass almost come from the second point .",
    "light gravitino free - streams to erase cosmic density fluctuations while it is relativistic . on scales smaller than the free streaming length of gravitino , fluctuations of matter and",
    "hence gravitational potential are erased . to see the effect ,",
    "we show matter power spectra @xmath88 for several values of @xmath0 with @xmath53 being fixed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpk ] .",
    "we take @xmath89 ev ( solid red ) , @xmath90 ev ( dashed green ) , @xmath91 ev ( dotted blue ) and @xmath92 ev ( dot - dashed magenta ) .",
    "as seen from the figure , as @xmath0 increases , the suppression of @xmath88 becomes larger on small scales , while on large scales the amplitude of @xmath88 is unaffected regardless of the value of @xmath0 . with more careful observation",
    "we can notice that when @xmath0 is small , the suppression of the power is small , but the scale under which @xmath88 is suppressed becomes large . on the other hand , when @xmath0 is large , the suppression is also large , however the free - streaming scale becomes small .",
    "these can be simply understood as follows .",
    "when the mass of gravitino is small , gravitino can erase cosmic structure up to large scales .",
    "however , the smallness of the mass in turn indicates that gravitino is minor component in the contents of energy density and gravitationally irrelevant .",
    "thus density fluctuations are less suppressed . for the case of larger mass , the opposite argument holds .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     first of all , from table  [ table : evidence ] we can see that planck or polarbear alone and even planck and polarbear combined give only negative bayes factor for the gravitino model against the cdm model , regardless of priors on @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is because for most of values of added parameters @xmath81 ( and @xmath94 ) from the cdm model , gravitino model can only marginally improve fit to the data , even though it indeed improves the fit at some values around the fiducial ones , @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 ) . in other words ,",
    "the complexity of the gravitino model has little advantage in explaining the data .",
    "the situation dramatically changes for the case of the cmbpol survey .",
    "from table  [ table : evidence ] we can see from cmbpol data we obtain bayes factor for gravitino model against the cdm model as @xmath97 for a case with fixing @xmath98 and using the bbn relation .",
    "this is interpreted as strong evidence in the jeffreys scale , though there s always some disagreement in that how much bayes factor can be regarded as giving enough evidence . for the cases with treating @xmath94 as a free parameter and using the bbn relation , we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "this can be regarded as giving only marginal evidence .",
    "so it is difficult to obtain enough evidence for general wdm model whose number density is not theoretically limited in some small range .",
    "fortunately , since gravitino has small model - dependence of @xmath94 we can take the former value of @xmath100 .",
    "so far we have discussed the case of fiducial gravitino mass @xmath0 . for larger gravitino mass ,",
    "as long as it is less than the current bound ( @xmath101 ev  @xcite ) , the evidence surely improves .",
    "this is because for this range of mass , the power spectra of lensing potential differ more and more from those for the cdm model as the gravitino mass increases .",
    "since , in section  [ sec : model ] we have seen that gravitino mass is expected to be @xmath102 ev or larger theoretically , the fiducial model of @xmath90 ev , which we used throughout this paper , can be supposed as a rather pessimistic case .",
    "since we have seen that even evidence for gravitino with mass 1 ev can be probed by a cmbpol - like survey , we would expect such a survey can probe most part of theoretically - motivated range of light gravitino mass .",
    "we hope such a survey would be realized and probe light gravitino model in the near future .",
    "we investigated a possible constraint on the light gravitino mass with @xmath103  ev in the light of future precise measurements of cmb .",
    "although the effects of free - streaming of light gravitino barely leave an imprint on cmb photons at the time of last scatter , they can be deflected by the gravitational potential altered after recombination due to the free - streaming effect , which can be probed with lensed cmb .",
    "thus we in this paper discussed the effects of the light gravitino , paying particular attention to the lensing potential , then investigated the future constraint on its mass .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the future cmb surveys such as planck , polarbear and cmbpol and study the issue by generating posterior distributions with nested - sampling method . for a simple ( but physically motivated ) case",
    ", we obtained the limit on the light gravitino mass , assuming @xmath90  ev as a fiducial value , as @xmath104 for the case with planck+polarbear combined and @xmath4 for cmbpol .",
    "thus at the time of cmbpol experiment , we can expect that the ( counter-)evidence of the light gravitino can be found in cosmological observations .    in a simple case ,",
    "the effective degrees of freedom at the time of the gravitino decoupling is assumed to have definite value and fixed in the analysis .",
    "however in some scenarios , this assumption may not hold , thus we have also made analysis by treating @xmath94 as a free parameter .",
    "in addition , in the future precise cmb measurements , the primordial abundance of @xmath8he , which is usually not assumed as a free parameter but fixed , can also affect the determination of cosmological parameters , therefore we also performed the analysis by varying @xmath93 too .",
    "when both or one of these parameters are varied , the constraint on the mass becomes weak .",
    "the results are summarized in tables [ table : case1]-[table : case4 ] .",
    "in addition , we also discussed how strong future cmb surveys can find an evidence for light gravitino by employing bayesian model selection analysis .",
    "even if the mass of gravitino is around 1 ev , a future cmbpol - like surveys is capable of providing some rather strong evidence for light gravitino model , which can be even stronger for larger @xmath0 .    in principle",
    "the light gravitino mass of @xmath105  ev can be probed with the lhc experiment with the method proposed in ref .",
    "but this requires some amount of tuning for the sparticle mass spectrum together with the gravitino mass .",
    "thus even if the lhc will fail to determine the light gravitino mass , the future cmb experiments can do this job .",
    "finally we make some comment on the case where massive neutrinos are also included in the analysis . from atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments , now we know that neutrinos have finite masses . furthermore it has been discussed that neutrino masses can be well probed with future cmb survey @xcite , which motivates us to conduct the analysis assuming that neutrinos are massive .",
    "thus we also investigated the constraint on the light gravitino mass while the mass of neutrino is also varied .",
    "since the effects of massive neutrino and light gravitino on the lensing potential are essentially the same , we found that strong degeneracies arise in particular , between their masses and we could not obtain any meaningful constraints on those .",
    "however , neutrino masses can also be constrained in future laboratory experiments such as tritium beta - decay and neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "thus in the future , we will also have some inputs from such neutrino experiments , which can remove the degeneracy in cmb survey . in light of these considerations",
    ", we can expect that cosmology and particle physics experiments will push us toward more severe constraint / precise determination of the light gravitino mass in the near future .",

    "<S> we investigate the possibilities of constraining the light gravitino mass @xmath0 from future cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) surveys </S>",
    "<S> . a model with light gravitino with the mass @xmath1 is of great interest since it is free from the cosmological gravitino problem and , in addition , can be compatible with many baryogenesis / leptogenesis scenarios such as the thermal leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the lensing of cmb anisotropies can be a good probe for @xmath0 and obtain an expected constraint on @xmath0 from precise measurements of lensing potential in the future cmb surveys , such as the polarbear and cmbpol experiments . </S>",
    "<S> if the gravitino mass is @xmath2 , we will obtain the constraint for the gravitino mass as @xmath3 for the case with planck+polarbear combined and @xmath4 for cmbpol . </S>",
