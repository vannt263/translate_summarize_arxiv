    "starting from the classical paper by t hooft @xcite the large @xmath1 limit of gauge theories has remained in the center of attention for more than 25 years . in high energy qcd - phenomenology for instance",
    ", the large-@xmath1 expansion proves its usefulness as a simplifying tool , if one attempts to resum higher order contributions , enhanced by large logarithms . with the general structure of the color factors being often too complex ,",
    "the large @xmath1 limit allows for resummation with an acceptable reduction of accuracy .    a new attraction of the large @xmath1 expansion results nowadays from the fact that it organizes the color structure of feynman diagrams in terms of topologies of two - dimensional surfaces which resemble the loop expansion of a closed string theory .",
    "with the advance of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which , in the limit of large @xmath1 , connects @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory with a closed string theory in anti - de - sitter space and with string coupling proportional to @xmath3 this idea is more prevailing than ever .",
    "the leading term of the large @xmath1 expansion is given by color factors that have the topology of the sphere or equivalently the plane , and one usually refers to these leading contributions as planar diagrams .",
    "planar diagrams contribute , for example , to gluon - gluon scattering amplitudes or to multi - gluon production amplitudes . on the other hand",
    ", there exist also processes where the @xmath1 leading color factor has not the topology of the plane .",
    "this is , for instance , the case for the scattering of two electromagnetic currents or virtual photons at high energies where the center of mass energy squared @xmath4 is far bigger than the momentum transfer squared and the virtualities of the photons . in this case , the interaction between the scattering currents is mediated by the exchange of gluons between two quark loops , and , with quarks in qcd in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xmath5 , the leading color factor has the topology of a sphere with two boundaries , a cylinder . within perturbative qcd such processes , at leading @xcite and next - to - leading order accuracy @xcite , are described by the bfkl - pomeron , which is a bound state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "higher order unitarity corrections are expected to involve bound states of more than 2 reggeized gluons , so called bkp - states @xcite , which for the cylinder topology have been found to be integrable @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we go one step further and consider the class of process whose leading color factor has the topology of a sphere with three boundaries .",
    "@xmath6     +    @xmath6    such a surface is depicted in fig.[fig : trouserr ] and it is usually referred to as the topology of a pair of pants. as a suitable example we consider the three - to - three process which describes the scattering of a highly virtual photon on two virtual photons in the triple regge limit .",
    "similar to the bfkl - pomeron on the cylinder , we resum all contributions which are maximally enhanced by logarithms of energies . the class of diagrams selected in this way is illustrated in fig.[fig : triple_discon ] : the three photon impact factors introduce three boundaries , and thus belong to the topology depicted in fig.[fig : trouserr ] . compared to the simple bfkl cylinder , the new feature is the splitting of one cylinder into two cylinders which is related to the triple pomeron vertex @xcite . within the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the electromagnetic current corresponds to the r - current , and the high energy behavior of the 6-point amplitude , on the string side , is expected to exhibit the triple graviton vertex .    in qcd",
    "this @xmath0 process has been investigated before for @xmath7 in @xcite , the triple pomeron vertex has been derived , and it has been shown to be invariant under two - dimensional mbius transformations @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to repeat the analysis for arbitrary @xmath1 and to take the large-@xmath1 limit of these calculations .",
    "the system of four reggeized gluons and the triple pomeron vertex have been further investigated particularly for the limit @xmath8 in @xcite .",
    "however the connection of these results with the expansion in terms of topologies of two - dimensional surfaces is not apparent . instead of the pair - of - pants ,",
    "the color factor rather seems to correspond to three disconnected cylinders . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore demonstrate that by summing only diagrams with the topology of the pair - of - pants , fig.[fig : trouserr ] , one obtains the result of the large-@xmath1 limit of @xcite . in particular we find that the reggeizing and irreducible terms of @xcite can be attributed to distinct classes of diagrams on the surface of the pair - of - pants .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : elastic ] we briefly review the planar and cylinder topologies . in the high energy limit ,",
    "the planar diagrams satisfy the bootstrap condition of the reggeizing gluon , whereas the cylinder diagrams lead to the famous bfkl amplitude . in section 3",
    "we turn to the analytic form of the @xmath9 scattering amplitude and give a general description of the diagrams which need to be summed . in section 4",
    "we study the color lines on the surface of the pants , arriving at the definition of two distinct classes of diagrams in color space ( named planar and non - planar ) .",
    "we also review the different momentum space kernels which describe the interactions of reggeized gluons . in section 5",
    "we sum the planar diagrams and arrive at the reggeized amplitudes introduced in @xcite , whereas in the section 6 we investigate the non - planar diagrams and re - derive the triple pomeron vertex of @xcite . in section 7",
    "we briefly summarize our results , and the final section 8 contains a few conclusions .",
    "in this section we begin by recalling the definition of the large @xmath1 expansion , following the classical paper by t hooft @xcite . as a preparation for the study of the pair - of - pants topology",
    ", we then reconsider the simplest examples of diagrams , whose color factor have the topology of the plane and of the cylinder . in the regge - limit",
    "they yield the reggeized gluon and the bfkl - pomeron , respectively .      to study the large @xmath1 limit as an expansion of topologies of the color factor , one is asked to translate the color factors of a scattering amplitude into the so - called double line notation .",
    "to this end we use the @xmath5 generators in the fundamental representation , @xmath10 , in the normalization from the standard normalization @xmath11 . ]",
    "@xmath12 , and we make use of the identity @xmath13   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all inner gluon lines in the adjoint representation , the indices can then be expressed in terms of ( anti-)fundamental indices by means of the fierz identity @xmath14 making use of a diagrammatic notation , where a kronecker - delta is represented by a single line with an arrow , indicating the flow from the upper to the lower index , @xmath15{delta.ps}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure constants @xmath16 are expressed as @xmath17{structure1.ps } }      -      \\parbox{1.3cm}{\\includegraphics[height=2cm]{structure2.ps } } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to arrive at the large @xmath1 expansion , one drops , in the fierz - identity eq.([eq : fierz ] ) , the second term . as a consequence ,",
    "the gluon is represented by a double line @xmath18{double.ps}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the neglect of second term of the fierz - identity eq.([eq : fierz ] ) which serves to subtract the trace of the @xmath5 gluon implies that we consider an @xmath19 gluon rather than an @xmath5 gluon . while this term is suppressed for large @xmath1 , dropping this term is only correct as long as we stay within the leading term of the expansion .",
    "tracelessness of the @xmath5 gluon can be taken into account by introducing an additional @xmath20 ghost field @xcite , which subtracts the trace of the @xmath19-gluon . since the @xmath20 ghost - field commutes with the @xmath19 gluon - field , it couples only to quarks , but not to gluons . within the leading logarithmic approximation , which we will use in the following",
    ", the interaction between scattering objects is mediated only by gluons , while quarks occur in the coupling of the gluons to the scattering objects .",
    "corrections due to the @xmath20 ghost in this approximation therefore appear only in low orders of the strong coupling and are taken into account easily .    using the double line representation for gluons , eq.([eq : double_line ] ) , and representing quarks in the fundamental representation by single lines , the color factor of a vacuum feynman diagram turns into a network of double and single lines , which can be drawn on a two - dimensional surface with euler number @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of handles of the surface , and @xmath23 the number of boundaries or holes .",
    "a closed color - loop always delivers a factor @xmath1 . with quarks being represented by single lines , a closed quark - loop , compared to a corresponding gluon - loop ,",
    "is @xmath24 suppressed and leads always to a boundary . for an arbitrary vacuum graph @xmath25 one",
    "arrives at the following expansion in @xmath1 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the t hooft - coupling which is held fixed , while @xmath1 is taken to infinity .",
    "the expansion eq.([eq : vacuumgraph ] ) matches the loop expansion of a closed string theory with the string coupling @xmath24 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the leading diagrams are those that have the topology of a sphere : zero handles and zero boundaries , @xmath28 .",
    "if quarks are included , the leading diagrams have the topology of a disk , i.e. the surface with zero handle and one boundary , @xmath29 .",
    "the disk fits on the plane , with the boundary as the outermost edge .",
    "diagrams with two boundaries and zero handles can be drawn on the surface of a cylinder , those with three boundaries on the surface of a pair - of - pants .",
    "boundaries are also be obtained by removing , from the sphere , one or more points : removing one point , one obtains the disk , which can be drawn on the plane , and by identifying the removed point with infinity , the graphs can be drawn on the ( infinite ) plane . removing two points we obtain the cylinder and so on . by definition , the expansion eq.([eq : vacuumgraph ] )",
    "is defined for vacuum graphs . however , from the earliest days on @xcite , the large @xmath1-limit has been also applied to the scattering of colored objects . in order to consider the topological expansion of an amplitude with colored external legs , one needs to embed it into a vacuum graph which then defines the topological expansion of an amplitude with colored external legs .    in the following",
    "it will be convenient to define modified couplings @xmath30 which absorb the factor @xmath31 .",
    "due to our normalization of @xmath5 generators which differs from the more standard one , @xmath32 , such a factor @xmath31 arises for each quark - gluon coupling and , because of eq.([eq : structure_const1 ] ) , also for each gluon - gluon coupling .      in the present paragraph",
    ", we shall discuss the regge - limit of planar amplitudes ( first addressed in @xcite ) which satisfy the bootstrap condition of the reggeized gluon , the basic ingredient for the further studies . in order to study reggeization of the gluon ,",
    "one considers the scattering of colored objects . to be definite",
    ", we consider the scattering of a quark on an anti - quark .",
    "the disk - topology of the color factors becomes apparent , if we connect color lines of the incoming quark and antiquark with each other and of the outgoing quark and antiquark ( note that , if instead we would connect the color lines of the ingoing and outgoing quark with each other and of the incoming and outgoing antiquark , we would discover the cylinder topology ) .",
    "as far as the momentum part of the diagrams is concerned , our method is the following : we consider the regge limit @xmath33 of the elastic amplitude and make use of the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , where we select all diagrams that are maximally enhanced by a logarithm in @xmath4 , i.e. that are proportional to @xmath34 , and sum them up to all orders in @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , in this approximation , all @xmath36-channel particles are gluons ( quark exchanges are power suppressed ) .",
    "we start by considering tree- and one - loop - level diagrams within the lla , and convince ourselves that these leading order result , for planar color graphs , satisfy the bootstrap condition and are thus in agreement with the reggeization of the gluon . at tree level ,",
    "the ( anti-)quarks interact by exchange of a single gluon . in the standard adjoint notation , the color factor of the diagram",
    "is given by @xmath37 , which in the double - line notation turns into @xmath38 , while the @xmath20-ghost can be disregarded for the plane .",
    "we therefore have @xmath39{qqbar_tree.eps } } & = \\parbox{1.5cm}{\\includegraphics[width=1.5cm]{qqbar_tree_nc.eps } } \\times t^{\\text{tree}}_{q\\bar{q}}(s , t ) , &   t^{\\text{tree}}_{q\\bar{q}}(s , t ) & = 2 \\bar{g } \\frac{-s}{t } \\bar{g}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from now on we adopt the following notation : in a feynman diagram gluons are usually denoted by curly lines , and in this notation the diagram is understood to represent both the color factors and the momentum part .",
    "alternatively , when drawing a diagram with the double line notation for each gluon , this diagram represents only the color part , and the momentum part has to be written separately .    turning to higher order graphs",
    ", we have the restriction that , with every insertion of an additional internal loop coming with a factor @xmath40 , we have to produce a closed color loop , yielding a factor @xmath1 which then combines to the t hooft coupling @xmath41 .",
    "only such higher order term will be included into the planar approximation discussed in this section .",
    "this restriction holds also for other topologies in the expansion eq.([eq : vacuumgraph ] ) : every insertion of an additional gluon into the born diagram provides automatically a factor @xmath40 and must be compensated by a closed color loop in order to stay within the considered coefficient @xmath42 of the expansion . for our planar loop , for each higher order graph the tensorial structure of the color factor will be proportional to the one of the born term .",
    "as far as the momentum part is concerned , the 1-loop diagrams for quark - antiquark scattering that contribute within the lla are shown in fig.[fig : col_corr_1gl ] .",
    ": @xmath43 = @xmath1    @xmath6    : @xmath43    for both diagrams , the momentum part is of the same order of magnitude , i.e. it is proportional to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , with @xmath46 in the regge limit .",
    "however , when counting closed color loops , one sees that only the first diagram is leading in @xmath1 .",
    "also , when closing the color lines of the incoming quark and antiquark and of the outgoing particles , we observe that for the first diagram the closed color factor , indeed , fits on the disk with @xmath29 , while the second closed color factor has an additional handle @xmath47 .",
    "we therefore find for the quark - antiquark scattering amplitude at 1-loop : @xmath48 where the color factor @xmath1 has already been included into the gluon trajectory function , and bold letters denote euclidean momenta perpendicular to the light - like momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the scattering quark and antiquark ; in particular @xmath51 .",
    "eq.([eq : beta_func ] ) can be understood as the order @xmath52 term of the expansion of the exchange of a planar reggeized gluon : @xmath53 for our further analysis we use the following analytic representation of the planar elastic amplitude in the regge limit : @xmath54 the partial wave amplitude @xmath55 is a real - valued function , and phases are contained in the signature factor @xmath56 : @xmath57 note the difference from the usual signature factor @xmath58 which contains both right and left hand energy cuts : at one loop we have shown that only the feynman diagram with the @xmath4-channel discontinuity belongs to the planar approximation whereas the @xmath59 discontinuity is absent . for quark - antiquark - scattering ,",
    "this also holds for higher order terms .",
    "we then take the discontinuity in @xmath4 @xmath60 which , by unitarity @xmath61 relates the mellin transform of the partial wave amplitude @xmath55 to the sum of production processes . to leading order in @xmath62 ,",
    "the partial wave has the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the non - singlet two gluon impact factor for quark and antiquark , and the convolution symbol is defined as @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "higher order corrections involve diagrams where additionally real gluons are produced . to leading logarithmic accuracy",
    ", real particle production takes place within the multi - regge - kinematics ( mrk ) , where the produced particles are widely separated in rapidity . the leading order diagram , with one additional @xmath4-channel gluon ,",

    "this integral equation coincides with eq.([eq : bfkl - eq ] ) , except for the factor @xmath115 in front of @xmath116 , which results from the cylinder topology .",
    "technically , we again split off the impact factor of the lower virtual photon and consider the partial wave amplitude @xmath117 for the scattering of a virtual photon on two reggeized gluons , which as before we define to contain the reggeon propagator of the external reggeized gluons .",
    "we find @xmath118 the kernel coincides with the bfkl kernel .",

    "the total cross section of this scattering process is obtained from the elastic scattering amplitude , @xmath125 , which describes a @xmath0 process , @xmath126 where @xmath4 denotes the square of the total center of mass energy of the scattering process .",

    "large energy variables are @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 which gives the squared mass of the diffractive system in which the upper virtual photon dissociates .",
    "the total energy square is given by @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , we have the momentum transfer variables @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "the triple regge - limit is given by @xmath134 .",
    "the investigation of such a process , for finite @xmath1 , has been started in @xcite , in the context of diffractive dissociation in deep inelastic scattering , and in the following we will stay close to the methods used there .",
    "let us begin with finite @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath135 amplitude in the triple regge limit has the following analytic representation @xmath136 all three @xmath36-channels carry positive signature , and the signature factors are given by @xmath137 the partial wave @xmath138 has no phases and is real valued . in analogy to the treatment of @xmath139 , we take the triple energy discontinuity in @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , @xmath143 which via a triple mellin transform relates the partial wave @xmath138 to the real valued triple energy discontinuity .    within the lla , each of the three virtual photons couples to the @xmath36-channel gluons by a quark - loop ( which in the topological expansion provides the three boundaries of the pair - of - pants ) . to leading order in @xmath40 , four @xmath36 channel gluons couple to the upper quark - loop , and two gluons to each of the two lower quark - loops , which yields diagrams like the one shown in fig.[fig : trouser ] .",
    "when taking the triple energy discontinuity , all intermediate states between the @xmath36 channel gluons are on mass - shell . for higher order corrections to these diagrams ,",
    "we make extensive use of unitarity and compute sums over products of production processes .",
    "some examples are shown in fig.[fig : triple_disc ] .",
    "due to the triple discontinuity , @xmath36-channel gluons do not intersect , and it is therefore useful to enumerate them from the left to right , with the most left gluon carrying the index @xmath144 .",
    "in order to form , within the lla , color singlet states which at the top couple to the virtual photon and at the bottom to two virtual photons , we are lead to qcd diagrams with four @xmath36-channel gluons at the lower and two , three or four @xmath36-channel gluons at the upper end .",
    "in contrast to our previous discussion of scattering processes on the plane and on the cylinder , the number of @xmath36-channel gluons can change , i.e. a @xmath36 channel gluon can emerge also from a @xmath4 channel produced gluon .",
    "however , in lla there is the restriction that , when moving downwards , the number of reggeized @xmath36 channel gluons never decreases .",
    "a special role in our analysis is taken by the diffractive mass @xmath141 as it defines the size of the upper cylinder of the pair - of - pants .",
    "in particular , the lowest intermediate state inside the @xmath141-discontinuity ( descending from the top to the bottom of the diagram ) defines the last interaction between the two legs of the pants , i.e. the branching point of the upper into the two lower cylinders .",
    "we use this branching point to factorize the partial wave @xmath145 into a convolution of three different amplitudes . with @xmath146 ,",
    "the diagrams below the branching point , within the lla , do not depend on the details of the dissociation of the upper virtual photon , and are therefore described by two independent amplitudes @xmath147 and @xmath148 which describe scattering of two @xmath36-channel gluons and their coupling to the lower photons .",
    "the functions @xmath147 and @xmath148 are given by bfkl - pomeron green s functions , convoluted with the impact factors of the corresponding lower virtual photon . in the following",
    "we will confirm that , in our topological approach , on the pair - of - pants the required color factors work out correctly .",
    "the part above the the branching point is resummed by the amplitude @xmath149 , which describes the scattering of the upper virtual photon on the four @xmath36-channel gluons . in the following ,",
    "our interest will mainly concentrate on this part of our scattering amplitude .",
    "after our general outline of which qcd diagrams contribute to the leading log approximation of the @xmath0 process we have to select now the contributions which belong to the large-@xmath1 limit on the pair - of - pants .",
    "this will be done by attributing to each qcd diagram a color diagram on the pair - of pants surface , where each gluon is drawn by a pair of color lines with opposite directions , as done for the plane and the cylinder in sec.[sec : elastic ] .",
    "all diagrams that contribute to the born approximation of the triple - discontinuity have the form of fig.[fig : trouser ] , with @xmath36-channel gluons coupling to the the quark - loop in all possible ways .",
    "overall , one finds sixteen different diagrams . because of",
    "the triple energy discontinuity @xmath36-channel gluons never intersect and hence can be labeled from the left to the right .",
    "a closer look then shows that , inside the quark loop , we have the four different orderings of color matrices : ( 1234 ) , ( 2134 ) , ( 1243 ) , and ( 2143 ) ( not distinguishing between cyclic permutations ) .",
    "these four structures are illustrated in fig.[fig : born ]     +    and are all of the order @xmath150      in order to study corrections to these born - amplitudes , we consider real gluon production processes on the pair - of - pants surface ( @xmath36-channel gluons are always reggeized ) .",
    "as to the selection of diagrams , we are searching the maximal power of color factors @xmath1 . with ( [ eq : borncounting ] ) the diagrams we are going to collect will come with the weight @xmath151 with @xmath152 being some positive integer number .",
    "this leads to the requirement that , for each gluon , the pair of color lines has to be planar , i.e. it never intersects .",
    "+    as a result we find two classes of color diagrams .",
    "the first class ( a ) consists of all diagrams which , by contracting closed color loops , coincide with one of the lowest order diagrams in fig.[fig : born ] .",
    "an example for such a diagram is given in fig.[fig : classes].a .",
    "in the following we will refer to these diagrams as planar diagrams .",
    "the second class ( b ) consists of those diagrams where the last vertex before the separation into the two lower cylinders is of the form illustrated in fig.[fig : classes].b : one easily verifies that the power of color factors is @xmath153 , as required by condition eq.([eq : bbb ] ) . also , there is no intersection of color lines on the pair - of - pants surface .",
    "these diagrams can not be redrawn , by contracting closed color loops in a straightforward way , such that they coincide with one of the lowest order diagrams of fig.[fig : born ] . the structure shown in fig.[fig :",
    "classes].b is reminiscent of the mandelstam diagram ( mandelstam cross ) which , when integrated over the diffractive mass @xmath154 , couples to the two pomeron cut ; we will therefore call it non - planar ( although it fits onto the surface of the pair - of - pants ) .",
    "note that this non - planar structure appears only once , namely at the point where the upper cylinder splits into the two lower ones .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe these two sets of diagrams in more detail .",
    "in particular , we list the momentum space expressions which belong to the gluon transition kernels . in the following section , we derive integral equations which sum all diagrams of set ( a ) .",
    "for set ( b ) we re - derive the triple pomeron vertex .",

    "an analogous result holds for the gluon pair ( 34 ) . if the interacting @xmath36-channel gluons end up in different quark - loops we need to distinguish between two different cases . in the first case , shown in fig.[fig : diff_ql_nearby ] ,",
    "the interaction is between gluons 2 and 3 ; on the surface of the upper cylinder the two gluons are neighboring .",
    "we call this interaction planar : by contracting the color loop above the rung between gluon 2 and 3 , we are back to the first born diagram in fig.[fig : born ] . in the second case , shown in fig.[fig : diff_ql_no_nearby ] , the interaction is between gluon 2 and 4 , these two gluons are not neighboring , and although the color diagram fits onto the surface of the pair - of - pants without any intersection of color lines , it will be referred to as non - planar. it can not be reduced to the born diagram in fig.[fig : born ] . counting closed color loops , it is of the same order as that of fig.[fig : diff_ql_nearby ] .",

    "it is useful to descend from the top to the bottom of the diagram : we start by inserting @xmath4-channel gluons between @xmath36-channel gluons which , on the upper cylinder , are neighboring ( figs.[fig : differentstructures]a and c ) .",

    "in the present analysis we have considered , in the large-@xmath1 limit , the triple regge - limit of the scattering of three virtual photons . our emphasis has been on the topology of color factors : we have summed , in the generalized leading - log approximation , only those diagrams which fit onto the pair - of - pants surfaces .",
    "these diagrams group themselves naturally into two classes ( fig.[fig : vpp ] ) .",
    "the first class consists of all diagrams which , by contracting closed color loops , coincide with one of the lowest order graphs ( of order @xmath268 ) illustrated in fig.13 . making use of the bootstrap conditions , the sum of these graphs is shown to reduce to reggeized gluons with a simple splitting vertex .",
    "in addition , starting at the order @xmath269 , a second class of diagrams appears which , by contracting closed color loops , can not be drawn as one of the lowest order graphs shown in fig.13 .",
    "the sum of these graphs can be written as a convolution of three bfkl amplitudes , connected by the triple pomeron vertex found in earlier papers .",
    "this triple pomeron vertex has been shown to be invariant under mbius transformation @xcite .",
    "the analytic expression for the six - point amplitude derived in this paper coincides with the large-@xmath1 limit of the qcd result in @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of the present paper provides another interpretation of gluon reggeization and the appearance of the mbius invariant triple pomeron vertex : on the pair - of - pant surface , the reggeizing pieces are completely planar , whereas the the triple pomeron vertex belongs to a distinct class of color diagrams which reflect the non - planar mandelstam cross .",
    "we believe that the topological approach pursued in this paper is well - suited for studying the regge limit of n=4 super yang mills theory within the ads / cft correspondence . on the string side ,",
    "amplitudes are naturally expanded in terms of topologies . in particular",
    ", the pair - of - pants topology studied in this paper is the same as that of the vertex which describes the coupling of three closed strings .    for a systematic study of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence it is convenient to make use of @xmath270-currents : they allow to formulate current correlators which are well - defined both on the gauge theory side and on the string side . as a first step of investigating , in the regge limit",
    ", the duality between n=4 super yang mills theory and @xmath271 string theory , the 4-point function for such currents has been studied on the gauge theory side in @xcite .",
    "this study confirms that the interaction between two @xmath270-currents in the regge - limit is , indeed , mediated by a bfkl - pomeron , and it contains the two gluon impact factors in n=4 sym . on the string side , the scattering of two r - currents has been shown to involve , in lowest order , the one - graviton exchange @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have addressed , on the gauge theory side , the next term in the topological expansion . as a start , we have restricted ourselves to nonsupersymmetric qcd(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the generalization to the supersymmetric case where , inside the impact factors , fermions and scalar particles in the adjoint representation have to be considered , will be presented elsewhere @xcite . on the string side ,",
    "the analogous 6-point r - current correlator is expected to contain the triple graviton vertex .",
