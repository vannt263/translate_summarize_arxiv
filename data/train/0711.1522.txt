    "the genetic architecture of biological organisms shows remarkable robustness against both structural and environmental perturbations @xcite .",
    "for example , quantitative models indicate that the functionality of the _ drosophila _ segment polarity gene network is extremely insensitive to variations in initial conditions @xcite and robust against architectural modifications @xcite .",
    "( also see @xcite . ) gene knock - out studies on yeast have shown that almost 40% of the genes on chromosome v have either negligible or no effects on the growth rate @xcite .",
    "certain cellular networks , such as the _ e. coli _ chemotaxis network , are also known to be very robust to variations in biochemical parameters @xcite .",
    "the genetic regulatory networks that control the developmental dynamics buffer perturbations and maintain a stable phenotype .",
    "that is why phenotypic variation within most species is quite small , despite the organisms being exposed to a wide range of environmental and genetic perturbations @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that genetic robustness evolved through stabilizing selection for a phenotypic optimum @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this in fact can be true by modeling a developmental process within an evolutionary scenario , in which the genetic interaction sequence represents the development , and the stationary configuration of the gene network represents the phenotype .",
    "his results indicate that the genetic robustness of a population of model genetic regulatory networks can gradually increase through stabilizing selection , in which deviations from the `` optimal '' stationary state ( phenotype ) are considered deleterious @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the effects of evolution of genetic robustness on the dynamics of gene regulatory networks in general .",
    "first , we examine the relationship between genetic robustness and the dynamical character of the networks . by dynamical character ,",
    "we mean the stability of the expression states of the network against small perturbations , or noise .",
    "models that are employed to study dynamics of gene networks , such as random boolean networks ( rbn ) @xcite or some variants of random threshold networks ( rtn ) @xcite have been known to undergo a phase transition at low connectivities @xcite , giving rise to change in dynamical behavior : on average , small perturbations will percolate through the network above the threshold connectivity ( chaotic phase ) , whereas they stay confined to a part of the network below the threshold ( ordered phase ) . intuitively , one might expect to find that robustness to mutations ( which are permanent structural changes , not dynamic perturbations ) is related to the dynamical behavior of the system , therefore , ordered gene regulatory networks should be genetically more robust than the chaotic ones . however , this is not necessarily true . here , we show that the relation between the dynamical character of a genetic regulatory network and its mutational robustness can be quite the opposite .",
    "in fact , even earlier studies provide a clue on this issue : for gene networks that have undergone selection ( i.e. , evolved ) , mutational robustness is known to increase with increasing connectivity @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", chaoticity has been shown to increase with increasing connectivity in random gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "these facts seem to contradict the intuitive interpretation of robustness since they suggest that chaotic networks can be mutationally robust .    although this inference is proven true in this paper , such an assessment can not be based on the previous studies of the dynamics of random networks @xcite , as the evolved networks ( with high mutational robustness and connectivity ) mentioned above @xcite have undergone selection .",
    "the selection process could potentially tune a network to exhibit a different dynamical character than its random ancestors .",
    "therefore , the dynamical character of the evolved networks should be studied independently and then compared with their random counterparts . here , we study the dynamics of the evolved networks numerically and show that selection for an optimal phenotype indeed has only a minor effect on their global dynamical behavior .",
    "this result indicates that the evolution of mutational robustness can not be understood in terms of simple dynamical measures .",
    "we also provide statistics on robustness to _ noise _ , which is the ability of a network to reach its `` optimal '' steady state after a perturbation to the gene - expression _",
    "trajectory_. computer simulations indicate that mutational robustness is correlated to robustness of the gene - expression trajectory to small perturbations ( noise ) , at least for short trajectories .",
    "this result is supported by recent studies @xcite . for perturbations of arbitrary magnitude",
    ", the basin size of the steady - state attractor provides a better measure .",
    "our analysis shows that basin sizes of densely connected networks ( which are highly chaotic ) have a broad distribution , and therefore such networks can have very large attractor basins @xcite .",
    "the yeast cell - cycle network has been reported to have similar properties @xcite .",
    "although chaoticity is just a side - effect of high connectivity , and not directly selected for during evolution , it appears that this intrinsic property of chaotic networks can be useful in terms of robustness to noise .",
    "when all of these measures are taken into account , chaotic dynamics does not seem be an obstacle for the networks with high connectivity since they are more robust to both mutations and noise than the ones that are sparsely connected .",

    "the expression states change in time according to regulatory interactions between the genes .",
    "the time development of the expression states ( i.e. , the dynamical trajectory taken by the network ) represents a developmental pathway .",
    "this deterministic , discrete - time dynamics of the development is given by a set of nonlinear difference equations , @xmath4 where sgn is the sign function and @xmath5 is the strength of the influence of gene @xmath6 on gene @xmath7 .",

    "otherwise , @xmath5 was assigned a random number drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "then , each `` gene '' of the initial configuration , @xmath18 , was assigned either @xmath3 or @xmath2 at random , each with probability 1/2 .",
    "after @xmath9 and @xmath14 were created , the developmental dynamics were started , and the network s stability was evaluated . if the system reached a fixed point , @xmath19 in @xmath20 time steps , then it was considered _ viable _ and kept .",
    "otherwise it was considered unstable , both @xmath9 and @xmath14 were discarded , and the process was repeated until a viable network was generated .",
    "( a viable network can have several fixed points and/or limit cycles in addition to @xmath21 . ) for each viable network , its fixed point , @xmath15 , was regarded as the `` optimal '' gene - expression state of the system .",
    "this is the only modification we made to the model used by @xcite : we accept any @xmath21 as long as it can be reached within @xmath20 time steps from @xmath14 , whereas @xcite generated networks with preassigned random @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "see supplementary fig . s2 . ]      in order to generate a collection of more robust networks , a mutation - selection process was simulated for each viable network as follows .",
    "first , a clan of @xmath24 identical copies of each network was generated .",
    "for each member of the clan , a four - step process was performed for @xmath25 generations :    1 .",
    "recombination : each pair of the @xmath0 rows of consecutive matrices in the clan were swapped with probability 1/2 . since",

    "2 .   mutation : each nonzero @xmath5 was replaced with probability @xmath26 by a new random number drawn from the same standard gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , on average , one matrix element was changed per matrix per generation .",
    "fitness evaluation : each network was run starting from the original initial condition @xmath14 . if the network reached a fixed point , @xmath27 within @xmath28 developmental time steps , then its fitness was calculated using @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the normalized hamming distance between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 denotes the inverse of the strength of selection , @xmath21 is the optimal gene - expression state , which is the final gene - expression state of the original network that `` founded '' the clan .",
    "we used @xmath34 .",
    "if the network could not reach a fixed point , it was assigned the minimum nonzero fitness value , @xmath35 4 .",
    "selection / asexual reproduction : the fitness of each network was normalized to the fitness value of the most fit network in the clan .",
    "then a network was chosen at random and duplicated into the descendant clan with probability equal to its normalized fitness .",
    "this process was repeated until the size of the descendant clan reached @xmath36 .",
    "then the old clan was discarded , and the descendant clan was kept as the next generation .",

    "any unstable networks were removed from the evolved clan .",
    "some steps of the process above may be unnecessary , and in fact , the results do not depend strongly on model details @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the entire procedure of @xcite was retained for compatibility .      the mutational robustness , @xmath37 of a network was assessed as follows .",
    "first , a nonzero @xmath5 was picked at random and replaced by a new random number with the same standard gaussian distribution .",

    "[ fig : stats2](g ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) and [ fig : before - and - after - plots](b ) ) @xcite . for viable networks ,",
    "the transient time increases with the connectivity .",
    "this is not surprising since state spaces of densely connected networks typically have basins with longer branches ( fig .",
    "[ fig : state - space - layout](b ) ) .",
    "however , selection brings the mean transient time down to around 2 , independent of the connectivity of the network .",
    "low transient time is one of the properties of highly robust networks @xcite .",
    "mutations are not the only kind of perturbations that genetic regulatory networks experience .",
    "all genetic systems are also exposed to noise created by both internal an external sources .",
    "we measure robustness to noise  dynamical robustness  using two parameters .",
    "the first one is the dynamical robustness , @xmath64 , of a gene expression state , @xmath65 , to small perturbations ( random one - bit flips ) , which is simply the fraction of nearest neighbors in hamming distance of @xmath65 that lie in the same basin as @xmath65 @xcite . in other words , @xmath64 is the probability that a random flip of a gene on @xmath65 yields a state that drains into the same attractor as @xmath65 .",
    "we also employ the mean robustness of a set of states , for instance , robustness of the gene expression trajectory , @xmath66 , which is the average of @xmath64 over all states in the trajectory ( including @xmath14 and @xmath21 ) . similarly , the robustness of the principal basin , @xmath67 , is the average of @xmath64 over all states in the basin , and the robustness of the entire state space , @xmath68 , is the average of @xmath64 over all possible states of the network .",
    "( we usually omit the term `` dynamical '' when we talk about robustness of a state or a set of states since the mutational robustness of a _ state _ is not defined . )",
    "the second parameter we use to estimate dynamical robustness is the normalized size of the principal basin , @xmath69 , which is the basin containing both @xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "the size of a basin is the total number of states it contains .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 is the fraction of all possible perturbations to the trajectory that leave @xmath21 unchanged , i.e. , the probability that flipping an arbitrary number of genes at random in a state on the trajectory does not change the attractor that the network settles into",
    ".    clearly , the parameters we employ to measure robustness to noise are quite different than conventional measures of stability , such as the damage - spreading rate .",
    "this is because we are interested in the endpoints of the gene expression trajectory , but not in the exact path taken .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the damage spreading and robustness to noise is not trivial .",
    "in fact , it is quite counterintuitive as explained below .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : stats1](g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) , densely connected networks have a greater number of larger basins as their basin - size distributions essentially follow a power law for about two decades .",
    "the effect of the connectivity on @xmath69 is similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : before - and - after - plots](c ) . networks with low connectivity have small principal basins both before and after selection .",
    "more densely connected networks have larger @xmath69 before selection .",
    "we see a small increase in networks with @xmath60 , while fully connected networks ( @xmath70 increase their @xmath71 significantly after evolution .",
    "however , compared to the change in mutational robustness , the effect of selection on the size of the principal basin is modest for highly connected networks .",
    "although greater connectivity increases the damage spreading ( sensitivity to small perturbations ) , the dynamical robustness of the trajectory , @xmath72 , as well , increases with the connectivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : before - and - after - plots](d ) ) . networks with @xmath73 have a small @xmath74 both before and after selection . the @xmath72 curve for the viables",
    "has a maximum around @xmath75 , which also shows no improvement after selection .",
    "this indicates that the networks with @xmath76 are intrinsically robust to noise , but not evolvable .",
    "viable networks with higher connectivity have monotonically decreasing values of @xmath74 , but the selection improves their average robustness significantly , above or up to the same level as the networks with @xmath75 .",
    "the robustnesses of the initial state , @xmath77 , and the final state , @xmath78 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : before - and - after - plots](e ) and ( f ) ) follow the same trend .",
    "the robustnesses of the principal basin , @xmath79 , and state space , @xmath80 , ( figs .",
    "[ fig : before - and - after - plots](g ) and ( h ) ) do not show as much improvement with selection .",
    "this implies that the effect of selection is more local ( on the specific gene - expression trajectory ) than global in terms of the change in dynamics .",
    "our results above agree with the findings by @xcite , who used very similar parameters to measure robustness to noise .",
    "we note that most of the robustness measures discussed above do not increase monotonically with @xmath81 for the viable networks ( i.e. , before selection ) .",
    "for example , @xmath82 for viable networks has a maximum around @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : before - and - after - plots](a ) ) .",

    "see text for details.[fig : correlations],title=\"fig : \" ]      the recent theoretical and computational work on gene regulatory networks @xcite indicates that there is a strong link between mutational robustness and robustness to noise . in order to see the relation between these two quantities , we calculated the correlation coefficients between the change in mutational robustness ( @xmath102 ) and changes in different measures of robustness to noise , as well as transient time and the damage spreading as functions of linkage density .",
    "changes in the transient time and mutational robustness are highly correlated in agreement with the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the principal basin size does not seem to have much effect on @xmath103 , as the correlation between their changes is quite weak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations](b ) ) .",
    "although a larger principal basin size means greater robustness to noise , this result suggests that it is not strongly selected for .",
    "changes in robustnesses of the initial state , final state , principal basin , and state space are also correlated with @xmath102 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : correlations](c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) ) . the weak correlation between the changes in the damage spreading and mutational robustness ( fig .  [ fig : correlations](h ) ) imply that it is not the change in dynamical behavior that brings mutational robustness .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed changes in state - space properties of model genetic regulatory networks under selection for an optimal phenotype . both numerical stability analysis and",
    "the state - space statistics indicate that the difference between the global dynamical properties of mutationally robust networks that have undergone selection and their random ancestors are quite small .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the changes in the damage spreading and the mutational robustness is weak .",
    "therefore , changes in the global dynamical properties do not seem to be responsible for the increase in mutational robustness after selection .",
    "dynamics of many random threshold networks , as well as random boolean networks , depend largely on their connectivity distributions .",
    "variants of the random threshold networks used in this paper have been shown to have a chaotic phase above @xmath104 , depending on the model details @xcite . essentially , rtns have a chaotic phase for sufficiently large @xmath23 @xcite just as rbns @xcite .",
    "the connectivity of a network affects the evolvability of its mutational robustness , as well as its dynamical character . for viable ( essentially random ) networks ,",
    "the mutational robustness is very similar for all connectivities @xcite . for the evolved networks ,",
    "however , it increases monotonically with increasing connectivity , creating drastic differences for large @xmath23 .",
    "the dynamical robustness of the gene - expression trajectory , the initial state , and the final state follow similar trends .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the stability of the system as measured by the damage spreading does not capture its dynamical characteristics in this context .",
    "as pointed out in a recent paper by @xcite , selection decreases the transient time by picking the `` proper '' interaction constants to construct a shorter ( or direct ) path from @xmath14 to @xmath21 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite stated that mutationally robust networks are the ones that have found a path for the gene expression trajectory at a safe distance from the basin boundary , so that small perturbations can not kick them into a different basin .",
    "thus , even if the selection operates only on the stability of the stationary gene - expression pattern , robustness to mutations intrinsically requires stability of the gene - expression trajectory against small perturbations .",
    "there is also some experimental evidence supporting the association between genetic and non - genetic change @xcite .",
    "although it might seem like robustness to noise evolves as a by - product of robustness to mutations , the converse case is also true @xcite .",
    "thus , robustness to noise and robustness to mutations seem to evolve mutually when certain conditions are met @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the cell - cycle regulatory network of budding yeast provides further evidence for the chaotic behavior of gene networks @xcite .",
    "the simplified form of this network has 11 nodes ( genes or proteins ) , one checkpoint ( an external input , in this case , the cell size ) , and 34 links including self - degrading interactions . using a dynamical model similar to the one used in this paper , @xcite _ _ _ _",
    "showed that the stationary state of the network has a basin occupying 86% of the state space .",
    "@xcite studied an ensemble of networks that can perform the same function , i.e. , the 12-step sequence of transitions in the expression trajectory , and found that these functional networks have larger basins for the stationary state ( consequently , broadly distributed basin sizes ) , fewer attractors , longer transient times , and a larger damage - spreading rate compared to their randomized counterparts .",
    "they concluded that those dynamical features emerge due to the functional constraints on the network .",
    "here , we showed that those features , which are signs of chaotic dynamics , can arise under the presence of structural perturbations ( mutations ) if the connectivity of the network is large enough , even when the constraints on the function are minimal , i.e. , when the only selection is on the phenotype .",
    "although the length of the gene - expression trajectory of the yeast cell - cycle network needs further explanation in terms of mutational robustness , it appears like chaotic dynamics may be a design principle underlying seemingly `` boring '' and ordered behavior generally seen in models of gene regulatory networks , where a simple cascade of expression terminates at a stationary state @xcite .",
    "the effect of network topology on evolvability of robustness is another aspect of the problem , which we do not discuss in this paper @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to point out that recent studies indicate that certain topological features , such as connectivity , are not very crucial in determining the response of cellular networks to genetic or non - genetic change @xcite , and there may be other factors shaping their topological structure @xcite .    our results also imply that the `` life at the edge of chaos '' hypothesis @xcite , which suggests adaptability ( evolvability ) is maximized in the critical regime does not seem to be necessary , at least not to explain evolvability of robustness to mutations and noise . indeed",
    ", recent studies concerning dynamics of genetic regulatory networks do not indicate any special feature brought by criticality @xcite .",
    "the `` edge of chaos '' concept was primarily developed to describe the phase in which cellular automata can perform universal computation @xcite , and it may not be related to dynamics and evolution of biochemical pathways as was once thought .",
    "to summarize , our study indicates that conventional measures of stability may not be very informative about robustness to mutations or noise in gene regulatory networks when one considers the steady gene - expression pattern as the robust feature of the network .",
    "also , the dynamics underlying the simple gene - expression trajectories can be very rich , reflecting a complex state - space structure .",
