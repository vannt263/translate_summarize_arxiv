    "binary systems are an ideal laboratory for the study of stellar astrophysics .",
    "they not only provide direct information on stellar mass , radius , and luminosity , which are all fundamental for the theory of stellar evolution , but also allow to probe stellar structures by measuring apsidal motions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since tidal forces from a star in a binary system are likely to affect the rotation rate and internal structure of the other component , one expects that the stellar quantities such as radius and effective temperature of binary stars may differ from those of single stars , as confirmed by observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the literature abounds with studies on the rotational and tidal distortions of stars , most of the studies are either approximate or based on prescribed rotation profiles , as detailed below . in this work",
    ", we employ a fully self - consistent method to investigate the quantitative effects of centrifugal and tidal forces on equilibrium polytropes in synchronously - rotating , circular - orbit binaries .    finding equilibrium configurations of polytropic stars under rotational ( and/or tidal ) distortion dates back to @xcite who used a perturbation theory in which an equilibrium density distribution was regarded as a small departure from a corresponding unperturbed lane - emden function .",
    "chandrasekhar considered only first - order terms in the rotation parameter @xmath10 ( see eq .  [ [ eq_ups_mu_nu ] ] for definition ) , corresponding to slow rotation .",
    "later , this perturbation method was extended to include terms of second order @xcite and third order @xcite .",
    "the first - order perturbation theory was further refined by @xcite who retained the first - order terms in the potential expansion , while allowing for large deformation of the equilibrium configurations from the unperturbed polytropes .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the first - order perturbation theory combined with `` complex lane - emden functions '' beyond their first roots gives much improved results for rotating polytropes .",
    "@xcite used a quasi - spherical method in which ( 1 ) the rotation velocity is assumed to be spherically symmetric rather than being cylindrically symmetric and ( 2 ) only the radial component of the centrifugal force is considered in the force balance ; these assumptions make rotating stars essentially spherical .",
    "recently , @xcite used a similar method to study the change of the total angular momentum due to tidal perturbations and the associated tidal instability . while the quasi - spherical method was able to handle the effects of rotation on stellar evolution in a very simplified way",
    ", it readily fails when the stellar shape becomes quite non - spherical .",
    "to study the internal structure of binary stars , @xcite constructed the roche model where the actual equipotential surfaces of distorted stars are approximated by the corresponding roche potentials of two point - mass stars ( see also @xcite ) . while the roche model is a good approximation for stars with very high central concentration , it assumes keplerian orbits and thus can not give any clue to the apsidal motions of binary stars .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite developed a so - called `` double - approximation method '' in which a distorted star is divided into two parts : a core containing most of the stellar material and a non - self - gravitating , low - density envelope .",
    "while the envelope is highly susceptible to applied centrifugal and tidal forces , the distortion of the core is assumed to be small even in the case of critical rotation .",
    "depending on the method to calculate the distortion of the core , the double - approximation method has several different branches : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used first - order perturbation theory of @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite included terms up to of second order ; @xcite and @xcite employed the quasi - spherical method .",
    "although the aforementioned work have improved our understanding of the rotational and tidal effects on stellar structure , these are only approximate and do not yield accurate results when the perturbations are rather strong .",
    "it was @xcite who first sought for direct numerical solutions for rotationally distorted polytropes without any assumption . by expanding the potential - density pairs in legendre polynomials up to of tenth order and integrating a set of the resulting ordinary differential equations _ simultaneously _",
    ", @xcite obtained solutions , with truncation errors less than 0.2% , for rotating polytropes . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite introduced a self - consistent field ( scf ) method that provides a concise , accurate , and very efficient computation scheme . in the scf method ,",
    "the equilibrium density distribution is found by solving the poisson equation as well as the equilibrium condition , _ alternatively _ and _ iteratively _",
    ", for the potential - density pairs .",
    "the scf method is so powerful that it has been applied to various problems including the structure of rotating stars @xcite and galactic dynamics of collisionless systems @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used a modified version of the scf method to construct stellar models for differentially - rotating , low - mass , main - sequence stars with a realistic equation of state ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while most scf methods for distorted stars are two - dimensional under rotational symmetry , @xcite formulated a three - dimensional scf method to calculate structures of rotating multi - body systems in which tidal effects are implicitly included .",
    "he showed numerically that there is an equilibrium sequence along which an ellipsoid takes on a dumbbell - like shape as the angular momentum of the whole system increases , eventually separating into a binary .",
    "although @xcite calculated the density structures and shapes of multi - body systems , these are for equal - mass objects ( owing to the imposed azimuthal symmetry ) with a few prescribed laws for spin and orbital angular velocities .",
    "later , @xcite generalized the method to allow for unequal - mass binaries , but the rotational velocity is still given externally rather than being calculated self - consistently , which makes it impossible to obtain information on apsidal motions .",
    "finding accurate internal structures of distorted stars in close binary systems are also of great importance in testing the classical theory of apsidal motions .",
    "apsidal motions arise when the gravitational force due to a star is different from that of a newtonian point - mass .",
    "the chief cause of perturbations to keplerian orbits is the rotational and tidal distortions that make the figures of binary stars deviate from spherical symmetry .",
    "also , the separate or combined effects of the general relativistic correction , the presence of a third body , and non - equilibrium tides can be also non - negligible ( see recent review of @xcite ) . for binary stars in near - circular motions",
    ", @xcite showed that the advance rate , @xmath11 , of the apsidal line due to the tidal and rotational distortion of star  with mass @xmath12 caused by the attraction of star  with mass @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15/a^3)^{1/2}$ ] is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath16 is the mean radius of star , @xmath17 is the orbital separation , and @xmath18 is the dimensionless apsidal motion constant . through",
    "more rigorous , first - order perturbation analyses , @xcite and @xcite generalized equation ( [ eq_apsidal ] ) to make it applicable to binaries with eccentric orbits , which has been widely used to estimate the degree of the internal density concentration via @xmath18 from observations .    however , the classical formulae of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have two limitations . first , by ignoring the cross terms of spherical harmonics in expanding equipotential surfaces , they are valid in a strict sense only when the tidal and rotational distortions are weak .",
    "second , by assuming an instantaneous adjustment of a star to time - dependent tidal force , they fail when the orbital period is shorter than the oscillation periods of tidally excited modes inside the perturbed star . @xcite and",
    "@xcite relaxed the second limitation to study the effects of dynamical and resonance tides ( still based on a linear perturbation theory ) , finding that the classical formulae are accurate as long as the ratio of the modal to orbital frequencies is less than about 10 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of the classical formulae is nonetheless questionable for close binaries , especially in the critical configurations , where the distortion of a stellar shape is large enough for nonlinear terms to be non - negligible .    despite a long history of research ,",
    "therefore , studies are still lacking as to how the stellar structure , shape , size , etc .",
    "of a distorted star as well as its apsidal motion rate in a close binary system vary with the fundamental parameters such as the mass ratio and orbital distance .",
    "more specifically , how good are the approximate methods described above for highly distorted stars ? what is the relative role of tidal force to centrifugal force in increasing the central density concentration",
    "? can the classical theory of apsidal motions based on perturbation analyses be accurately applied even to critical configurations ? to address these questions , we in this work consider a circular - orbit binary in which two components are modeled as a polytrope and a point - mass , respectively , and calculate the equilibrium structure of the polytrope using an scf method . the binary is assumed to be in spin - orbit synchronization , so that the tide is independent of time . as explained below , two salient features of our scf method compared to those in the previous studies",
    "are that the former considers only the polytropic component in density computation , while explicitly including the tidal force from its companion as a fixed gravitational potential , and that the orbital velocity indispensable for calculating the apsidal motion rates is now obtained self - consistently from the equilibrium condition .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec_for ] , we describe our implementation of the scf method to find the equilibrium structure of a synchronously rotating binary component . in  3 , we first present the numerical solutions for unperturbed polytropes and uniformly - rotating polytropes and compare them with the published results .",
    "we then turn to the solutions for both rotationally- and tidally - distorted polytropes , and give detailed quantitative results on the changes of internal structures as well as on the parameters describing critical configurations . using the self - consistent solutions of perturbed polytropes , we test the classical theory of apsidal motions in  4 . finally in  5 , we summarize our results and discuss the astronomical implication of our work .",
    "in this paper we use an scf method to study the equilibrium structure of a self - gravitating star under the external gravitational force from a companion in a close binary system .",
    "we assume that two stars revolve in circular orbits with constant angular speed @xmath19 and orbital separation @xmath17 , so that the tidal force is stationary .",
    "we further assume that a star in question with mass @xmath12 and volume radius @xmath16 ( hereafter star ) , composed of inviscid polytropic gas without magnetic fields , rotates rigidly and synchronously with the orbital motion . for simplicity",
    ", we treat the companion star ( hereafter star ) as a point mass with mass @xmath13 .",
    "we work in a rotating cartesian frame at @xmath19 whose origin lies at the center of mass of star .",
    "figure [ pic_geom ] schematically illustrates the binary configuration and the coordinate system in which the @xmath20-axis points toward star  located at @xmath21 and the @xmath22-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "star  is distorted rotationally and tidally , and has a polar radius @xmath23 and an equatorial radius @xmath24 along the positive @xmath20-axis .",
    "we assume for computational convenience that all the substance of star  is contained within a sphere with radius @xmath25 , the distance to the inner lagrange point from the origin .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium then takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the pressure , @xmath28 is the density , and @xmath29 is the effective potential defined by @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq_pot ] ) , @xmath31 is the centrifugal potential @xmath32 ^{2}+y^{2}\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath33 being the mass fraction of star , @xmath34 is the gravitational potential from star @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the self - gravitational potential of star  that satisfies the poisson equation @xmath37 the proper boundary conditions on @xmath36 are that @xmath38 and its first derivatives should behave well at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and should be continuous on the surface of a polytrope",
    ". these boundary conditions are automatically satisfied when we use the integral representation of the poisson equation in  [ sec : exp ] below .",
    "we assume that the matter of star  obeys a polytropic relation @xmath41 with the pressure constant @xmath42 and the polytropic index @xmath0 .",

    "it is sometimes useful to measure the degree of rotational perturbations in terms of the mean density @xmath64 as @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    because of tidal and rotational distortions , the orbital motions of close binary stars are different from purely keplerian ones",
    ". for binaries in spin - orbit synchronization , the angular velocity is naturally constrained by equation ( [ eq_ang_vel ] ) , or its dimensionless form @xmath66 however , it turned out in our scf method that @xmath67 calculated from equation ( [ eq_ang_dim ] ) was too small and varied too much to give converged results at the very early stage of iterations .",
    "instead , we empirically found that the condition @xmath68 corresponding to a vanishingly - small pressure gradient at the center of mass of star , allows the solutions to converge rapidly , and is in fact very similar to equation ( [ eq_ang_dim ] ) when an equilibrium is achieved . in practice , therefore , we first use equation ( [ eq_ang_velocity_dim ] ) to update @xmath19 until a temporary convergence is made , and then switch to equation ( [ eq_ang_dim ] ) to obtain the desired equilibrium solutions .    to check the accuracy of equilibrium configurations that we construct , we use the virial parameter @xmath69",

    "<S> we consider a synchronized , circular - orbit binary consisting of a polytrope with index @xmath0 and a point - mass object , and use a self - consistent field method to construct the equilibrium structure of the polytrope under rotational and tidal perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> our self - consistent field method is distinct from others in that the equilibrium orbital angular velocity is calculated automatically rather than being prescribed , which is crucial for obtaining apsidal motion rates accurately . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the centrifugal and tidal forces make perturbed stars more centrally condensed and larger in size . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 polytopes with fixed entropy , the enhancement factor in stellar radii is about @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , where @xmath6 is the fractional mass of the polytrope relative to the total . </S>",
    "<S> the centrifugal force dominates the tidal force in determining the equilibrium structure provided @xmath7 for @xmath8 . the shape and size of rotationally- and tidally - perturbed polytropes are well described by the corresponding roche models as long as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the apsidal motion rates calculated for circular - orbit binaries under the equilibrium tide condition agree well with the predictions of the classical formula only when the rotational and tidal perturbations are weak . </S>",
    "<S> when the perturbations are strong as in critical configurations , the classical theory underestimates the real apsidal motion rates by as much as 50% for @xmath1 polytropes , although the discrepancy becomes smaller as @xmath0 increases . for practical uses </S>",
    "<S> , we provide fitting formulae for the density concentration , volume radius , coefficient of the mass - radius relation , moment of inertia , spin angular momentum , critical rotation parameter , effective internal structure constant , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , as functions of @xmath6 and the perturbation parameters . </S>"
