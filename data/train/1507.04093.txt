    "we call the generating function of certain type as the partition function for the case",
    ". there are kinds of partition functions for different purpose .",
    "the most known ones are partition function of @xmath0-spin intersection numbers , hurwitz partition function and hodge partition function .    the well - known witten conjecture @xcite was proved by m.kontsevich @xcite , it stated the identitical between the generating function of intersection numbers on moduli space of stable curves and the @xmath3-function of kdv hierarchies",
    ". then and there , e.witten introduced @xmath0-spin curves and their moduli spaces , and he conjectured that the generating function of the @xmath0-spin intersection numbers is a solution to @xmath0-reduced kp hierarchies @xcite .",
    "the conjecture about @xmath4-spin intersection numbers was exactly witten s original statement .",
    "the generalised conjecture was proved by c. faber , s. shadrin and d. zvokine using tautological relations @xcite .",
    "after then , investigating the problems involved with the @xmath0-spin intersection numbers become fascinating subjects .    as pointed out by witten @xcite , that the partition function of the intersection numbers of @xmath5-classes on @xmath6 is a solution to kdv hierarchies , and with an additional string equation , completely determine the intersection numbers . similarly , with an additional string equation , the @xmath0-reduced kp hierarchy completely determine @xmath0-spin intersection numbers @xcite . besides the string equation , the partition function for @xmath0-spin intersection numbers also satisfies a dilaton equation and a wdvv equation .",
    "all these three equations are called the tautological equations or the universal equations . in principle , the @xmath0-spin intersection numbers can be obtained through the tautological equations in a recursive way @xcite . in @xcite , k.liu and",
    "his collaborators express any given @xmath0-spin intersection number as the sum of products of simpler @xmath0-spin intersection numbers . by this way",
    ", they could obtain all the @xmath0-spin intersection numbers .",
    "but the definitely works for higher genus are highly nontrivial , for the recursive relations would be very complicated .",
    "it is well known that the partition function for @xmath0-spin intersection numbers also satisfies linear constraints , called as the virasoro constraint in the @xmath7 case and the @xmath8-constraint in general cases .",
    "in fact , such constraints are equivalent to @xmath0-reduced kp hierarchies additional with a string equation @xcite .",
    "solving the linear constraints is an effective method to calculate the @xmath0-spin intersection numbers . in the @xmath7 case",

    "one is the hurwitz partition function , there are many interesting results about it . the hurwitz partition function can be represented in terms of a cut - and - join operator @xcite , this operator is an element of the @xmath1 group , acting on the space of kp solutions , which guarantees that the hurwitz partiton function is a kp @xmath3-function .",
    "another one is the hodge partition function , which is a generating function of linear hodge integrals .",

    "the hodge partition function is a deformation of the kw @xmath3-function i.e. the partition function of @xmath4-spin intersection numbers . a.mironov and",
    "a.morozov had mapped the hodge partition function to the kw @xmath3-function by a givental operator , and from this they get the virasoro constraint for hodge partition function from the virasoro constraint of the kw @xmath3-function @xcite .",
    "however , the givental operator is not an element of the @xmath1 group , then the integrable property of the hodge partition function is obscured in this expression .",
    "the partition function of @xmath0-spin intersection numbers is identical with a @xmath0-reduced kp @xmath3-function , while the hodge partition function is given by a kp @xmath3-function .",

    "@xmath7 , a.alexandorov has conjectured a form of this operator @xcite , and recently the conjecture has proved independently by a.alexandrov himself@xcite , x.liu and g.wang @xcite . from their result , an intersection number could be expressed as an infinite summation of hodge integrals .",
    "for the partition function of @xmath0-spin intersection numbers , any element in the @xmath2 constraint is an element of the @xmath22 algebra , so there must be a @xmath2 constraint for the hodge partition function whose elements are generators of the @xmath22 .",
    "however , up to now this type of operator and the @xmath2 constraint is unknown yet .    in this paper",
    ", we will give a determinantal representation for the partition function of @xmath0-spin intersection numbers .",
    "this expression is equivalent to a fermionic representation of it , with the help of the boson - fermi duality , and we can formulate it as a linear combination of the schur function on eigenvalues of external field in the gkmm .",
    "then , we can get the schur polynomials representation by the miwa transformation .",
    "it is well known that the cut - and - join operator generating the hurwitz partition function and the virasoro operators can be expressed as elements of the @xmath23 algebra .",

    ", we get the bosonic version of this operator , and from the expression , a @xmath0-spin intersection number can be expressed as a finite summation of hodge integrals .",
