    "investigations of sheath formation in front of a floating plate have hitherto been restricted to fluid studies on the ion time scale [ 1 ] . by contrast , the response of the plasma in the very early stages of sheath formation is not well known . in this paper , we present pic simulations of the plasma dynamics over just a few electron plasma periods after the beginning of the process .",
    "these simulations have been performed by means of the bit1 code [ 2 ] , developed on the basis of the xpdp1 code from u. c. berkeley [ 3 ] .",
    "a floating plate is placed in contact with a uniform , quasi - neutral plasma , which is assumed to be infinitely extended on one side . due to the higher thermal velocity of the electrons ,",
    "the plate starts charging up negatively , so that electrons are gradually repelled , ions are attracted , and a positive - space - charge sheath begins to form .",
    "an electron plasma wave is observed the properties of which strongly depend on the plasma characteristics ( electron and ion temperatures , plasma density , etc . ) .",
    "our pic simulations are performed with different numerical set - ups and plasma characteristics .",
    "a full set of simulation diagnostics is used to measure the properties of the electron waves .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system .",
    "the planar conducting plate and the ( artificial ) right - hand boundary of the systems are placed at positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the length @xmath7 is to be chosen large enough for this system to reasonably approximate a semi - infinite plasma ( @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the electron debye length ) . in order to have adequate resolution in space ,",
    "the length of the grid cells has been selected as @xmath10 .      at the initial time @xmath11 the electron and ion densities are equal @xmath12 , the distribution functions of both particle species are fully maxwellian , and the electric potential is zero @xmath13 everywhere in the system , including the plate surface .    throughout the entire simulation , the following boundary conditions are applied to the particles : at the plate , all particles impinging are absorbed and no particles are injected into the plasma . at the right - hand boundary , on the other hand , all particles impinging are absorbed but new particles with half maxwellian distribution functions are injected at a constant rate .",
    "the system is floating , i.e. , the sum of particle plus displacement currents equals zero . according to these conditions we observe the following behavior .    in the unperturbed plasma region (",
    "i.e. , for @xmath14 ) the electron velocity distribution function will not change appreciably ( so that @xmath15 ) , whereas at the plate it will acquire a cut - off form .",
    "this is because the negative - velocity electrons are absorbed by the plate and charge it negatively ; during this process , the ions can be considered to be at rest . with increasing negative surface charge , the negative potential drop in the region close to",
    "the plate becomes higher and more and more electrons are reflected towards the plasma . after some time this perturbation propagates into the system .",
    "the shape of the distribution function essentially depends on the potential drop at the plate .    due to the loss of particles by absorption at the plate ,",
    "the total number of particles in the system is dropping all the time .",
    "however , this aspect is not of great concern here because the total loss of particles during the entire simulation presented is negligible .      in the following tables we present the parameters used for our simulation .",
    "the ( electron and ion ) particle fluxes corresponding to the unperturbed plasma region are : @xmath16    these expressions are used to calculate the particle injection fluxes from the right - hand boundary .",

    "r0.5     figure [ pot_strat_sursa ] shows the potential profile close to the plate at @xmath49 s. the potential drop at the beginning of the sheath evolution is monotonic in space .",
    "after quick acquisition of negative charge , the plate repels the electrons in the form of a pulse leaving behind a positive - space charge region . as a result ,",
    "the potential close to the plate becomes slightly positive . in front of this region ,",
    "the negative space charge produced by the primary - pulse electrons leads to a potential minimum ( `` virtual cathode '' ) , which gradually reflects more and more slower electrons back into the plasma .",
    "these latter electrons spend a long time in the region of the virtual cathode and hence deepen its potential further . according to figures .",

    "r0.5     to verify that these waves are physical and not just due to numerical effects , we have performed other simulations with different parameters .",
    "in particular , we concentrated on the electron temperature .",
    "we know that the debye length is proportional to the square root of the electron temperature .",
    "hence , if we increase the temperature by a factor of four , the debye length must increase by a factor of two .",
