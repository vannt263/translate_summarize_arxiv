    "studies of the outermost region of the solar system started in antiquity as documented by the historical record of comet observations @xcite . among the oldest are babylonian inscriptions referring to a comet of 674 b.c .",
    "the first proven observation of the 1p / halley comet is recorded in the chinese text _",
    "shih chi _ dated 239 b.c . , and its revisits of the inner solar system have been recorded by subsequent generations of astronomers .",
    "however , ancient astronomers had very little knowledge about the origin of these comets . only in 1950 , based on observations of a handful of so - called long - period ( lp ) comets was the conclusion made that there is a huge reservoir of @xmath1@xmath2 comets that surrounds the solar system at distances larger than @xmath1@xmath3 au @xcite . since that time the total number of identified lp comets has increased to @xmath1400 @xcite .",
    "this reservoir is now known as the oort cloud ( oc ) and its outer edge is placed between @xmath4 and @xmath5 au @xmath6 pc @xcite . the oc population is the least explored in the solar system because its extremely distant location from the sun renders the detection methods used for objects such as kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) ineffective",
    ".    perturbations due to the galactic tide , passing stars , and giant molecular clouds alter the orbits of objects in the oc .",
    "the result is that a small fraction of these objects are injected into the inner solar system , appearing as lp comets .",
    "such comets are the only members of the oc population that are available for study by astrophysical methods so far .",
    "therefore , conclusions on the structure of the oc and composition of its bodies are mainly based on the studies of lp comets .",
    "as the comets are largely composed of ices , other oc bodies are assumed to have a similar composition .",
    "the sizes of the comet nuclei range between a few km to @xmath150 km .",
    "a population of bodies below a sub - kilometer size is _",
    "terra incognita_.    the oc is believed to be a remnant of the proto - planetary disk that formed around the sun approximately 4.6 billion years ago .",
    "the total mass and geometry of the oc are determined by very indirect methods and rely mostly on computer - intensive simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the planetesimals comprising the oc initially coalesced much closer to the sun , but gravitational interactions with giant planets ejected the proto - planetary material into the outer edge of the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as the accretion and collision rates in the oc are extremely slow , it is believed that it contains the most pristine material left over from the epoch of planet formation .    a new method to study the populations of small solar system bodies ( sssbs  such as main belt asteroids ( mbas ) , jovian and neptunian trojans , and kbos ) has been recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the cosmic - ray ( cr ) induced @xmath0-ray flux from sssbs which are large enough for the cr cascade to fully develop in the rock ( typically @xmath7 meter in diameter ",
    "the `` thick target '' case ) strongly depends on the size distribution of the sssb populations and may be detectable with the large area telescope ( lat ) , the primary instrument on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) ( formerly the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) _ ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum from these processes is very steep with an effective cutoff around 1 gev . if detected by the lat , it can provide unique information about the number of objects with sizes down to a few meters in each system .",
    "for objects with diameters below @xmath8 meter , the cr cascade does not fully develop since the total column density of material is @xmath9 interaction length . in this `` thin target '' case ,",
    "the albedo @xmath0-rays depend only on the total column density of material in a particular direction .",
    "the albedo spectrum has a shape characteristic of @xmath10-interactions where the high energy spectral slope is similar to that of the incident cr spectrum .",
    "therefore , it is possible also using @xmath0-ray observations to put constraints on the total amount of debris in each system .",
    "the outermost frontier of the solar system , the oc , has a wide distribution on the sky .",
    "this is different to other populations of small bodies such as the mbas , jovian and neptunian trojans , and kbos which are distributed near the ecliptic .",
    "the albedo @xmath0-rays produced by cr interactions with debris in the oc apparently contribute to the isotropic @xmath0-ray background ( igrb ) , which is usually assumed to be extragalactic .",
    "a correct estimate of the @xmath0-ray albedo of the oc is important for disentangling the truly extragalactic component . on the other hand ,",
    "an estimate of the total column density of the dispersed material in the oc may shed light on the early history of the solar system and constrain planetary evolution models .",
    "the  was first discovered by the sas-2 satellite @xcite and confirmed by egret @xcite .",
    "the  is thought to be a superposition of all unresolved sources of high - energy @xmath0-rays in the universe plus any truly diffuse component .",
    "a list of the contributors to the includes `` guaranteed '' sources such as blazars and normal galaxies @xcite , and potential sources such as galaxy clusters @xcite , shock waves associated with large scale cosmological structure formation @xcite , distant @xmath0-ray burst events @xcite , pair cascades from tev @xmath0-ray sources and ultra - high energy crs at high redshifts ( so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cut - off ) .",
    "a consensus exists that a population of unresolved agn certainly contribute to the  inferred from egret observations ; however predictions range from 25% up to 100% of the @xcite .",
    "a summary of the conventional contributors to the  can be found in @xcite . a number of exotic sources that may contribute to the have also been proposed : baryon - antibaryon annihilation phase after the big bang , evaporation of primordial black holes , annihilation of so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , and strings . the  is a weak component which is difficult to disentangle from the intense galactic foreground .",
    "extensive work has been done @xcite to derive the spectrum of the  based on egret data . a new detailed model of the galactic diffuse emission @xcite lead to a new estimate of the  @xcite which is lower and steeper than found by @xcite ; it is not consistent with a power - law and shows some positive curvature , as expected for an origin in blazars .",
    "but , recent work has shown deficiencies in the understanding of the .",
    "two more diffuse emission components originating nearby in the solar system have been identified : @xmath0-ray emission due to inverse compton scattering of solar photons by cr electrons @xcite and a @xmath0-ray glow around the ecliptic due to the cr - induced @xmath0-ray albedo of sssbs @xcite .",
    "the former has been detected in the egret data at a level consistent with predictions @xcite .",
    "significantly , the level of emission from this process is comparable to the current estimate of the  within @xmath11 of the sun path on the sky .",
    "although an extensive literature on the origin , population , and dynamics of the oc exists , properties of the oc population are derived mostly from computer simulations and studies of the lp and halley - type comets which are thought to originate in the oc . in this section ,",
    "we give a brief overview of the structure of the oc relevant to the current investigation . for more detailed information",
    "we refer the reader to the exhaustive books and reviews ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "observation of a sharp spike in the number distribution of comets at near - zero but bound energies , representing orbits with semimajor axes exceeding @xmath3 au , led @xcite to conclude that the spike , a huge near - spherical cloud of icy bodies at @xmath12 au ( outer oc ) , had to be the source of the lp comets .",
    "@xcite has shown that the apparent inner edge of the oc at a semimajor axis @xmath13 au could be a selection effect due to the small probability of close stellar passages capable of perturbing comets at smaller distances .",
    "the number of comets that reside in the hills cloud ( inner oc ) at semimajor axes of a few thousand au could be significantly larger than in the outer oc .",
    "the inner oc could also serve as a reservoir that replenishes the outer oc stripped by an external perturber .",
    "close passages of stars perturbing the inner oc could result in so - called `` comet showers '' , the extreme increases in cometary flux which lasts for a few orbital periods after the passage .",
    "one such shower may be responsible for a @xmath12.5 my period of increased bombardment of the earth which produced the large popigai ( 100 km ) and chesapeake bay ( 90 km ) craters and several smaller craters @xmath136 million years ago @xcite .    a possible clue to the existence and the structure of the inner oc could be the halley - type comets .",
    "dynamical simulations show that the source of these comets @xcite is required to be a massive doughnut - shaped inner oc with median inclination between 10@xmath14 and 50@xmath14 . yet , there could exist a third innermost region , the so - called _ inner core _",
    "@xcite , which may span between the scattered disk component of the kuiper belt and the inner oc .",
    "the inner core may harbor a large number of comets and mass , but does not exhibit itself due to the lack of very close stellar passages . dwarf planets",
    "90377 sedna and 148209 2000 cr@xmath15 could be the first inner core candidates .",
    "dynamical models put the total number of comets with @xmath16 au at @xmath1@xmath17 . assuming an average mass for a comet @xmath18 g , the total mass is estimated at @xmath19 .",
    "the more massive inner oc could harbor @xmath1@xmath20 comets , which yields a mass of @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "there is no information on the total mass and number of sub - kilometer size bodies .",
    "even closer to the sun , beyond neptune s orbit there is the kuiper belt .",
    "the kbos are not uniformly distributed , with at least three dynamically distinct populations identified : the classical disk , the scattered disk with large eccentricities and inclinations , and `` plutinos '' around the 3:2 mean motion resonance with neptune at 39.4 au .",
    "kbos are distributed between 30  100 au ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a majority of the kbos have their orbits distributed near the ecliptic with fwhm of the order of 10@xmath14 in ecliptic latitude @xcite . the total mass of kbos is estimated to be in the range @xmath10.010.3 @xmath22 , while the most often used value is @xmath10.1 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a summary of the mass and size distributions of kbos , mbas , and population of small bodies in jovian and neptunian trojan families can be found in @xcite .    the mass and size distributions for populations of asteroid families or other sssbs",
    "are thought to be governed by collisional evolution and accretion . under the assumptions of scaling of the collisional response parameters and an upper cutoff in mass , the relaxed size distributions approach a power - law @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the radius of the body , and @xmath25 for a pure @xcite cascade . in reality",
    "different populations of sssbs show deviations from this index .",
    "the dust particles and grains in the solar system are subject to many processes which produce a negligible effect on larger bodies , therefore simulations of the dynamics of the asteroid populations can not tell much about the total mass of debris nor the size distribution .",
    "the main forces acting on small particles are ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : gravitation , radiation pressure which is directed outward from the sun , the poynting - robertson effect which is essentially a drag reducing the orbital eccentricity and causing the particles to slowly spiral toward the sun , sublimation , collisions among dust particles , plus interactions with the solar wind and magnetic field due to a small electric charge carried by grains which further complicates their dynamics .",
    "the relative effect of these processes is different across the range of particle sizes and number densities .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to simulate the distribution of debris in the solar system .",
    "however , if the column density of the debris is large enough its distribution can be directly probed with the _",
    "fermi_/lat @xmath0-ray telescope .",
    "our previous calculations @xcite considered bodies large enough to be in the thick - target case . to calculate the cr - induced @xmath0-ray albedo of sssbs",
    ", the moon spectrum has been used as a template and scaled according to the size distributions and densities of bodies in different populations , such as the mbas , jovian and neptunian trojans , and kbos .",
    "the cr - induced @xmath0-ray albedo spectrum of the moon itself has been calculated by @xcite using a monte carlo code based on the geant4   framework .",
    "most of the lunar @xmath0-ray emission comes from the thin rim with a steep fall off with energy , essentially cutting off above 34 gev .",
    "the central portion of the moon disk has an even steeper spectrum with a cutoff above @xmath1600 mev .",
    "the model calculations are in excellent agreement with the egret observations of the moon @xcite .",
    "for objects with sizes smaller than @xmath8 meter the cr cascade does not fully develop ; this is similar to cr interactions with a single nucleus with the produced @xmath0-ray flux scaling linearly with the total amount of material in the interaction column .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum in this case is harder than the thick - target case with a spectral slope close to that of the parent cr nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0-ray albedo of larger bodies has a soft spectrum which will also contribute to the total @xmath0-ray flux @xmath261 gev .",
    "therefore , the total albedo spectral shape below / above 1 gev will depend on the relative abundances of the debris material and the larger rocks .",
    "production of @xmath0-rays in @xmath10-interactions from the decay of neutral pions and kaons has been discussed in many papers ( e.g. , @xcite , and more recently @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-ray flux using the method described in @xcite which is based on the work of @xcite . for collisions involving nuclei ,",
    "the corresponding cross section is multiplied by a factor @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the beam and target nucleus atomic numbers @xcite , while the energy per nucleon is the kinematic variable .",
    "the accuracy of this method is enough for the current calculations .",
    "since oxygen is the most abundant element in the interstellar rock and ice we calculate the production cross section of @xmath0-rays for cr protons and alphas interacting with an oxygen target nucleus .",
    "the cross section is converted from nucleus@xmath30 to g@xmath30 units by multiplying by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is avogadro s number .",
    "the total @xmath0-ray emissivity is obtained by integrating the respective production cross sections with the interstellar ( unmodulated ) incident spectrum of cr protons and alphas taken from @xcite .    .",
    ", width=336 ]    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the spectrum of the  derived from the egret data @xcite together with the @xmath0-ray albedo of the oc debris ( thin - target case ) shown for different total column densities ( top to bottom ) : 0.01 , 0.001 , 0.0001 g @xmath33 .",
    "the latter can be compared with the total gas column density along the line of sight to the edge of the galactic disk through the galactic center : @xmath10.15 g @xmath33 assuming an average 1 h - atom @xmath34 and a maximum galactocentric radius @xmath120 kpc .",
    "the integral @xmath0-ray emissivity in the thin - target case can be easily estimated :    @xmath35    and the integral intensity simply following by multiplication with the column density , @xmath36 , e.g. , @xmath37",
    "@xmath33 s@xmath30 , where @xmath36 is in units g @xmath33 .",
    "any assumption of the spatial distribution of debris would be highly speculative . for an order of magnitude estimate we take the simplest case of debris concentrated in a spherical shell with radius @xmath38 .",
    "in this case the total mass of debris is : @xmath39where @xmath38 is the distance in au .",
    "it is enough to have @xmath1@xmath40 of material spread out over @xmath41 at @xmath42 au , which corresponds to @xmath43 g @xmath33 , to obtain a @xmath0-ray albedo flux within an order of magnitude of the igrb .",
    "this column density corresponds to @xmath1@xmath44 of the total column density along the line of sight through the galactic disk .",
    "since the @xmath45 dependence is very strong , much less material is required to produce the same albedo @xmath0-ray flux at a smaller effective distance and vice versa .",
    "the total mass and distribution of sssbs smaller than cometary nuclei are highly uncertain , as is the spatial distribution of debris .",
    "although , simulations indicate that the number of comets and the total mass considerably increase toward the inner edge of the oc . it is entirely possible that @xmath1@xmath46 @xmath22 of debris is distributed in the vast space of the oc .",
    "since the oc has spherical and disk components , it is possible that the oc @xmath0-ray albedo is brighter around the ecliptic .    the minimal detectable mass in debris for other systems",
    "can also be estimated ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "for example , assuming that kbos are distributed uniformly within @xmath47 around the ecliptic , the fraction of the total solid angle subtended by the kuiper belt is @xmath48 .",
    "the detectable mass of kbo debris can then be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath49 , with @xmath50 g @xmath33 , and @xmath51 au .",
    "jovian and neptunian trojans would appear as point - like sources .",
    "the integral @xmath0-ray flux from a point - like mass @xmath52 of debris at a distance @xmath38 au is : @xmath53where we used the emissivity @xmath54 corresponding to the interstellar cr spectrum calculated earlier . since",
    "1 gev photons are produced by cr protons of @xmath5510 gev , which are only slightly modulated in the heliosphere , this is a good approximation .",
    "the one - year lat integral point source sensitivity is @xmath56 @xmath33 s@xmath30 .",
    "this gives a detectability condition for one year of exposure : @xmath57 the proposed method is sensitive enough to detect a debris mass as small as @xmath10.1% ",
    "50% of the total mass of the system .",
    "it is most sensitive for the mba population due to its proximity , but can also provide meaningful limits on more distant populations , such as jovian and neptunian trojans , kbos , and oc .",
    "a clear signature of the described process is the power - law spectrum of the @xmath0-ray albedo ( @xmath551 gev ) which has an index similar to that of the incident cr spectrum .",
    "the larger photon statistics of the projected 5-year lat mission will probe even smaller debris masses for all these systems .",

    "understanding of the instrumental backgrounds within the lat will allow discrimination of the igrb at 10% of the current level @xcite .",
    "this will allow a meaningful estimate of the foreground from the oc and other asteroid populations to be obtained .",
    "on the other hand , correct determination of such a foreground will allow for more accurate determination of the truly extragalactic component of the diffuse emission ."
