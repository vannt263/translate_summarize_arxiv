    "extragalactic cepheid variable stars are key objects in astronomy because they are _ standard candles _ ( primary distance indicators ) owing to the correlation between their pulsation period , @xmath1 , and luminosity , @xmath2  the well known @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship .",
    "the magellanic clouds have been pivotal objects in the permanent recalibration of the @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship because the slope of this relationship is usually based on cepheids in these two nearby extragalactic systems , while several carefully selected galactic cepheids serve as calibrators of the zero - point of the relationship .    when attempting to improve the calibration , one of the main goals is to decrease the spread of the points around the ridge - line fit .",
    "the dispersion of the relationship is caused by various factors ( recently summarized by * ? ? ?",
    "one of these factors is the presence of a companion to the cepheid .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of binaries among galactis cepheids exceeds 50 per cent @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a strong observational selection effect that hinders the discovery of binarity , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "owing to their distances , cepheids in the magellanic clouds appear much fainter than their galactic counterparts .",
    "one of the consequences of this fact is the extremely low number of cepheids known to be members in binary systems in the magellanic clouds ( see sect .  [ census ] ) .",
    "binarity of cepheids can be revealed by spectroscopic , photometric , or astrometric methods as summarized by @xcite . in the case of cepheids in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the spectroscopic method is the most efficient one in revealing binarity .",
    "the spectroscopic signs that hint at the presence of a companion include : + - a secondary star hotter than the cepheid component results in an excess flux in the uv region as compared to the normal cepheid spectrum ; + - variations in the radial velocity due to the orbital motion superimposed on those of pulsational origin . + cepheids in the magellanic clouds are too faint for uv spectroscopy with the current and former equipments ( e.g. , the _ iue _ space mission dedicated for uv spectroscopy ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy can be , however , instrumental in increasing the number of known spectroscopic binaries among magellanic cepheids .",
    "the orbital effect can be observed if the line of sight towards the cepheid is nearly parallel or subtends a small angle to the orbital plane of the spectroscopic binary system .",
    "in this paper we point out spectroscopic binary nature of hv914 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( sect .",
    "[ hv914 ] ) . based on a comprehensive search for relevant data and papers in the literature ,",
    "we publish a state - of - the - art census of known binaries among magellanic cepheids ( sect .  [ census ] ) and",
    "select several suspected binaries suggested for dedicated spectroscopic studies ( sect",
    ".  [ susp ] ) .",
    "the brightness variability of this cepheid located in the lmc was discovered by @xcite based on harvard photographic plates .",
    "the cepheid nature of variability and the first value of the pulsation period ( 6.8795d ) was published by @xcite .",
    "further observations of this cepheid have not been performed until the commencement of the microlensing projects .",
    "the analysis of the extensive ogle - iii photometric data set ( obtained in @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands ) resulted in an accurate period of 6.8783932d @xcite .",
    "the phase curve in @xmath3 band is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_hv914 ] .",
    "recently , hv914 was included in a spectroscopic observational project of magellanic cepheids @xcite .",
    "the impressive radial velocity phase curves published by @xcite densely cover the whole pulsation cycle for all target cepheids and the individual data scatter around the normal curve by less than 0.1 kms@xmath5 for the 22 program stars except hv914 ( see fig .  2 in * ?",
    "in the case of classical cepheids , such excessive dispersion of the radial velocity phase curve can be caused by : + - using an inaccurate period when plotting the phase curve ; + - an additional excited mode ; + - spectroscopic binarity .",
    "the value of the pulsation period is accurately known from the precise ogle - iii photometric data covering the years 1997 - 2008 .",
    "because the radial velocity data by @xcite are based on observations performed during the years 2000 - 2003 , the same period can be assumed as obtained from the ogle - iii data : 6.8783932d .",
    "in fact , @xcite plotted their radial velocity data for hv914 using the period of 6.878425d which is not identical with the previous value but this slight difference ( of 0.000032d ) can not be responsible for the dispersion exceeding 5 kms@xmath5 seen in the radial velocity phase curve .",
    "the high - quality light curve ( fig .  [ fig_lc_hv914 ] ) testifies that hv914 is a single - mode cepheid .",
    "an indirect additional evidence in favour of the single - mode pulsation is the fact , that secondary periods are only excited in cepheids with fundamental period shorter than 4 days in the lmc @xcite .",
    "phase curve of hv914 @xcite .",
    "the data have been folded on the period rounded to 6.8784d , the zero phase set arbitrarily at jd2400000,height=207 ]        -velocity of hv914,height=207 ]    if hv914 has a physical companion orbiting the cepheid component , the orbital period can not be shorter than 1 - 2 years , because cepheids are supergiant stars . in this case a seasonal shift is expected in the radial velocity phase curve whose amount depends on the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight .",
    "in fact , such seasonal shifts are noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig_vrad_hv914 ] .",
    "the thousand - day observational interval was not sufficiently long to cover a complete orbital cycle .",
    "but even in this case , the monotonic shift of the centre - of - mass radial velocity ( @xmath6-velocity ) plotted in fig .",

    "is suspected that has to be confirmed by new and more accurate radial velocity data .",
    "+ - the clearest ( though still weak ) spectroscopic evidence of binarity exists for ngc1866-we8 , whose radial velocity phase plot ( based on 6 data ) contains a deviating point ( from 1989 ) with respect to the 5 observational data obtained in 1988 ( see fig .",

    "* ) .    revealing binarity of individual cepheids in the magellanic clouds is important because the calibration of the @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship relies on the slope determined from magellanic cepheids .",
    "companions to cepheids increase the dispersion of the resulting @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship .",
    "moreover , shorter period cepheids are more affected by the adverse photometric effects because of smaller luminosity difference between the cepheid and its companion .",
    "this may even cause a period dependent slope of the @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship .    to avoid such distorsions , cepheids with known companions have to be excluded from the calibration of the @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship . if , however , physical properties of the companions can be determined , the @xmath1-@xmath2 relationship can be calibrated based on the binary cepheids themselves ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic binarity of hv914 , a cepheid in the large magellanic cloud has been revealed from existing radial velocity data .",
    "further accurate data are necessary to determine the orbital elements .    the census of cepheids known to belong to binary systems is also studied for both magellanic clouds . the serious deficiency of binary member cepheids ( with respect to their galactic counterparts ) is explained by the lack of dedicated observational studies .",
    "radial velocity observations of a large number of cepheids in the magellanic clouds , especially those having high values of the @xmath12 and/or @xmath14 amplitude ratios ( listed in this paper ) are desirable .",
