    "though the spectra of f2 m 1227 + 3214 has hints that the global column density may be much higher than that along the line - of - sight , the spectrum of f2 m 0830 + 3759 requires that this be the case .",
    "such significantly different column densities globally versus along the line - of - sight , where the former is much higher than the latter , is consistent with the expecations of the red quasar paradigm : these sources may be in the midst of expelling their cocoons of obscuring gas , making the view to the central engine relatively unobscured and broad - emission line gas visible , while large gas column densities out of the line - of - sight are still present and play a role in reprocessing the observed x - ray emission .",
    "indeed , the fact that the global column density is shown by our x - ray observations to be below the compton - thick regime is consistent with the picture presented in @xcite , where the red quasars are observed in a phase after the compton - thick gas is evacuated , as in the @xcite model .",
