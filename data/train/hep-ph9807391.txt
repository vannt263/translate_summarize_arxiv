    "the self - interaction among gluons is a distinctive feature in the qcd theory . it may lead to build bound gluon states , glueballs . thus discoving of the glueball",
    "will be a direct test to the qcd theory .",
    "although there are several glueball candidates experimentally , there is no conclusive evidence on them .",
    "people recently pay particular attention to two scalar states : @xmath2(1500)(j=0 ) @xcite and @xmath3(1710 ) ( j=0 ) @xcite , they seem like glueballs",
    ". however , the explicit analyses @xcite on them reveal that neither of them appears to be a pure meson or a pure glueball .",
    "most probably they are mixtures of glueball and @xmath4 meson .",
    "the property of the glueball has been investigated in the lattice gauge theory and in many models based on the qcd theory . even in the lattice gauge calculation , there are different predictions for the @xmath0 glueball@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "some years ago , the mass of the @xmath0 glueball was predicted around @xmath5 mev .",
    "recently , ibm group @xcite predicts the lightest @xmath0 glueball mass : @xmath6 mev , and uk qcd group @xcite gives the estimated mass : @xmath7 mev respectively .",
    "the improvement of determination of the @xmath0 glueball mass originates from the more accuracy of the lattice technique , however , at present the uncertainty still exists .",
    "v. a. novikov _",
    "et al _ @xcite first tried to estimate the scalar glueball mass by using qcd sum rules@xcite , but they only took the mass to be 700 mev by hand because of uncontrolled instanton contributions . since then , p. pascual and r. tarrach @xcite , s. narison @xcite and j. bordes _ et al _",
    "@xcite presented their calculation on the scalar glueball mass in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "they all got a lower mass prediction around @xmath5 mev when they used the moments @xmath8 or @xmath9 and neglected the radiative corrections in their calculation of the correlators .",
    "e. bagan and t. steele @xcite first took account of the radiative corrections in the correlator calculation . choosing appropriate moments(@xmath9 and @xmath10 ) for their calculation",

    "it seems that the radiative corrections make a big difference on the prediction of the scalar glueball mass .",
    "obviously , there are some uncertainties in the determination of the scalar glueball mass , in order to give the reliable values in the qcd sum rules reasonably , an analysis of these uncertainties is necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we first give the criteria to choose the moments , which are obtained by the borel transformation of the correlator weighted by different powers of @xmath12 , according to application of qcd sum rules .",
    "it is important to choose suitable moments to determine the glueball mass@xcite . from the criteria",
    "follows that different moment has different result , but not all of them are reliable . by choosing appropriate moment",
    ", we get the glueball mass without radiative corrections : @xmath11 gev . when the radiative corrections are included in , glueball mass shifts a little : @xmath13 gev .",
    "secondly , we consider the effect of mixing between lowest - lying @xmath0 glueball and @xmath14 meson , i.e. , the gluonic currents and quark currents couple both to glueball states and @xmath1 states .",
    "therefore , there are some exotic form factors to be determined . by using the low - energy theorem",
    ", we can construct a sum rule for the mixing correlation function ( one gluonic current and one quark current ) . through these relationship and",
    "based on the assumption of two states ( lowest - lying states of glueball and @xmath1 meson ) dominance , we find the mass for @xmath0 glueball is around : @xmath15 gev , which is a little higher than the pure resonance prediction while the mass for @xmath0 meson is around : @xmath16 gev , which is a little lower than the pure resonance prediction .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 a brief review about the calculation of the mass of physical state from qcd sum rules is given . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the criteria of choosing the moments and the effect of the radiative corrections . the mixing effect of the glueball with the meson state",
    "is studied in sect .",
    "finally , the last section is reserved for a summary .",
    "let us consider the correlator @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the current with definite quantum numbers .    in the deep euclidean domain(@xmath19 )",
    ", it is suitable to carry out operator product expansion ( ope ) @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are wilson coefficients .",
    "then , the correlator can be expressed in term of vacuum expectation values of the local operators @xmath22 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath23 in the minkovski domain(at positive values of @xmath12 ) , which is called the spectral density , is relevant with the physical observables .",
    "therefore , we can extract some information of the hadrons from qcd calculation by using the dispersion relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 are some subtraction constants originated from the facial divergence of @xmath23 . in order to keep control of the convergence of the ope series and enhance the contribution of the lowest lying resonance to the spectral density",
    ", the standard borel transformation is used . however , in practice , it may be more convenient to use the moments @xmath26 instead , which is defined by @xmath27 -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{s_0}^{+\\infty}s^k e^{-s\\tau}im\\pi^{\\{pert\\}}(s)d s\\\\\\nonumber & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{s_0}s^k e^{-s\\tau}im\\pi(s)d s ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the borel transformation and @xmath29 is the borel transformation parameter , @xmath30 is the starting point of the continuum threshold . using the higher rank moments",
    ", one can enchance the perturbative contribution and suppress resonance contribution . in the following",
    ", we will see the role of @xmath26 in our analysis .",
    "in this paper , the @xmath0 gluonic current is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 in eq.([current ] ) stands for the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath33 is the quark - gluon coupling constant .",
    "the current @xmath18 is the gauge - invariant and non - renormalization(to two loops order ) in pure qcd .    through operator product expansion ,",
    "the correlator without radiative corrections becomes @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for the non - perturbative condensates the following notations and estimates are used @xmath37 now , we can apply the standard dispersion representation for the correlator @xmath38 to connect the qcd calculation with the resonance physics . from the low energy theorem",
    "@xcite follows that @xmath39    for the physical spectral density @xmath40 , one can divide it into two parts : low energy part and high energy part .",
    "its high - energy behavior is known as trivial , @xmath41 while at low energy region , @xmath40 can be expressed in the single narrow width approximation .",
    "the single resonance model for @xmath40 leads @xmath42 where m , f are the glueball mass and coupling of the gluon current to the glueball .",
    "thus we can proceed the following calculation .    to construct the sum rules",
    ", we use the moments @xmath26 defined above , then the standard dispersion relation is transformed into @xmath43 and from eq.([moment ] ) we have ( for @xmath44 ) @xmath45    renormalization - group improvement of the sum rules amounts to the substitution : @xmath46^{7/11}\\langle g g^3\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47 without radiative corrections can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) .",
    "if we had a complete knowledge of resonances and qcd , we would be able to fix the glueball mass , then different moments @xmath48 would give the same result definitely , but we are far from this goal . in practice , we can not calculate the infinite terms in ope .",
    "therefore , the result will depend on the choice of the moments .",
    "there should be a criteria to choose some suitable moments at appropriate @xmath30 .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the @xmath8 sum rule leads to a much smaller mass scale due to the anomalously large contribution of the low - energy part @xmath49 of the sum rule and it violates asymptotic freedom at large energy region .",
    "they claimed that @xmath8 was not reliable to predict the @xmath0 glueball mass and employed the @xmath9 and @xmath10 moments to predict the @xmath0 glueball mass by fitting the stability criteria with the radiative corrections considered .",
    "their approach showed that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 sum rules with the radiative corrections result in a higher mass scale compared to previous mass determination .",
    "they did nt analyze how reliable these moments @xmath26 are for determining the glueball mass . after analyzing the different moment with the criteria of qcd sum rules",
    ", one can find that @xmath9 is not reliable too for the calculation of @xmath0 glueball in the single narrow width resonance approximation . in order to determine",
    "which moment is the more suitable and give a reliable mass prediction , we re - examine the @xmath26 sum rules .    to improve the convergence of the asymptotic series , we study the ratio @xmath50 , such as @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the narrow width approximation",
    ", we have @xmath53 and(with @xmath44 ) @xmath54 to proceed calculation , we choose the following parameters @xmath55    @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the functions of @xmath30 which is the starting point of the continuum threshold , @xmath58 . since the glueball mass @xmath59 in eq.([m ] ) depends on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we take the stationary point of @xmath56 versus @xmath29 at an appropriate @xmath30 as the square of the glueball mass .    to determine the suitable moment and the appropriate @xmath30 ,",
    "the following criteria are employed : ( 1 ) , the moments should be chosen to have a balance between the perturbative and the lowest lying resonance contribution to the sum rule , which means that both the perturbative contribution and the lowest resonance contribution to the sum rule are dominant in the sum rules ; ( 2 ) , @xmath30 should be a little higher than the physical mass and approaches it as near as possible due to the continuum threshold hypothesis and the narrow width approximation ; ( 3 ) , the choice of moments and a suitable @xmath30 should lead to not only a widest flat portions of the plots of @xmath56 versus @xmath29 but also an appropriate parameter region of @xmath29 with the parameter region compatible to the value of the glueball mass . according to these criteria , the acceptable region of @xmath30 is chosen from @xmath60 gev@xmath61 to @xmath62gev@xmath61 .",
    "let s begin our analysis through the @xmath26 sum rules without radiative corrections .",
    "it is known that different moment has different suppression to the nonperturbative contribution and the lowest resonance contribution , moments with higher rank enhance the perturbative contribution and suppress the lowest resonance contribution to the sum rules .    in the sum rule of the moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 , although there is a platform for mass prediction(see fig .",
    "1 ) , the perturbative contribution is less than @xmath63 , which is not fit the criteria ( 1 ) , so it is not acceptable .    using the moment @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", one can obtain a balance between the perturbative and the lowest resonance contribution to the sum rules , however there is no platform for mass prediction ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . it does nt satisfy the criteria ( 3 ) , so this moment is not suitable for the mass prediction either .",
    "all the previous calculations without radiative corrections were based on either moment @xmath8 and @xmath9 or moment @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "so the results are not very reliable .",
    "the ratio @xmath64 in fig .",
    "3 gives an excellent platform , and we can find a balance between the perturbative and the lowest resonance contribution to the sum rules , which keep the perturbative contribution and the lowest resonance contribution dominant in the sum rules , the moment @xmath10 satisfies all of the criteria and is reliable for the glueball mass determination .",
    "the curve shows that the @xmath0 glueball mass is @xmath65 mev . in the acceptable region of @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath0 glueball mass is @xmath66gev .",
    "the moments with higher rank ca nt stress the lowest resonance contribution in the sum rule , because the higher dimension condensates will not be negligible(we have little knowledge about higher dimension condensates at present ) .",
    "therefore , we have no way to proceed our prediction from @xmath26 with @xmath67 .",
    "after taking into account radiative corrections , the correlator is@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70    the predicted mass from ratio @xmath64 is @xmath13 gev(see fig .",
    "the value is a little lower than the one without radiative corrections .    in this section , we show how the predicted glueball mass depends on the choice of the moment .",
    "we give the criteria on choosing suitable moments and @xmath30 to calculate the glueball mass in qcd sum rules . from the criteria , only @xmath10 @xmath71 are reliable for determination of the @xmath0 glueball mass and the result",
    "is @xmath11 gev .",
    "the radiative corrections do not affect the mass determination sensitively , they shift the glueball mass a little lower : @xmath72 gev .",
    "now we proceed to discuss the mixing effect to determination of @xmath0 glueball mass .",

    "we illustrate our result in fig.5 . in this figure , the solid line corresponding to the glueball and the doted line corresponding to the meson",
