    "among various parent compounds of the recently discovered fe - based superconductors , @xcite eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 is a unique member of the ternary `` 122 '' @xmath12fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath12 = ba , sr , ca , etc ) family since it contains two magnetic sublattices . in a purely ionic picture ,",

    "recently , superconductivity was observed in @xmath18 transition metal element doped eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 with @xmath19 up to ~ 22 k.@xcite the magnetic ground state of the optimally doped , superconducting eu(fe@xmath20ir@xmath21)@xmath2as@xmath2 was determined by our single - crystal neutron diffraction measurement.@xcite below 17 k , the eu@xmath4spins order ferromagnetically along the crystallographic @xmath17-direction .",
    "both the structural phase transition and the sdw order of the fe sublattice were found to be fully suppressed in the optimally doped compound with bulk superconductivity .",
    "similar conclusions were obtained on polycrystalline eu(fe@xmath22ir@xmath23)@xmath2as@xmath2 by anand @xmath24 @xmath25 based on muon spin relaxation ( @xmath26 ) and neutron powder diffraction measurements.@xcite however , the phase diagram describing how the magnetic order of the eu@xmath4 spins is tuned by the ir doping is still not available .",
    "in addition , although it is well established that for the iron pnictides the chemical doping suppresses the sdw order of the fe@xmath4 moments in the underdoped region of their phase diagrams , the magnetic properties of the transition metal dopants themselves were not well understood so far . to the best of our knowledge , there exists only a few experimental studies about the magnetic nature of the transition metal dopants in the iron pnictides.@xcite for instance , 3@xmath10 co in baco@xmath2as@xmath2 does not order magnetically,@xcite while spin polarization of 4@xmath10 ru and 5@xmath10 ir dopant atoms was observed by x - ray resonant magnetic scattering measurements in superconducting ba(fe@xmath27ru@xmath28)@xmath2as@xmath2 and ba(fe@xmath29ir@xmath30)@xmath2as@xmath2 , respectively , revealing strong coupling between the magnetism of fe and the transition metal dopants.@xcite in our case of eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 contaning both fe and eu magnetic sublattices , it will be more interesting to investigate the magnetism of the dopant atoms since both fe and eu might exert some influence on them .    here",
    "we present the results of our x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) and polarized neutron diffraction measurements on an underdoped , non - superconducting eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0.06 ) single crystal , which displays multiple phase transitions .",
    "compared with the parent compound , the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition and the antiferromagnetic order of the fe@xmath4 moments are well seperated , significantly suppressed to @xmath5 = 111 ( 2 ) k and @xmath6= 85 ( 2 ) k by 6% ir doping , respectively .",
    "in addition , the eu@xmath4 spins order within the @xmath7 plane in the a - type antiferromagnetic structure similar to the parent compound , suggesting that the magnetic structure of the eu@xmath4 spins starts to be tuned from afm to fm within the intermediate ir doping level between 6% to 12% .",
    "however , the ordering temperature is evidently suppressed to @xmath8= 16.0 ( 5 ) k by 6% ir doping .",
    "most strikingly , the xrms measurements at the ir @xmath9 edge demonstrates that the ir 5@xmath10 states are magnetically polarized with the same propagation vector as the magnetic order of fe .",
    "with @xmath11 = 12.0 ( 5 ) k , they feature a much lower onset temperature compared with @xmath6 .",
    "our observation suggests that the magnetism of the eu sublattice has a considerable effect on the magnetic nature of the 5@xmath10 ir dopant atoms and there exists a possible interplay between the localized eu@xmath4 moments and the conduction @xmath10-electrons on the feas layers .",
    "single crystals of eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0.06 ) were grown from self - flux ( fe , ir)as . the chemical composition of the crystals was determined by energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis .",
    "a 3 mg platelike single crystal with dimensions ~ 2 @xmath31 2 @xmath31 0.2 mm@xmath32 was selected for both the xrms and polarized neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "the mosaicity of the crystal was less than 0.03 , confirming the high quality of the chosen crystal .",

    "the polarized neutron diffraction measurements were carried out on the diffuse neutron spectrometer ( dns ) at heinz maier - leibnitz zentrum ( mlz ) , garching ( germany).@xcite the wavelength of the incident neutrons is 4.544  .",
    "although the neutron absorption effect of eu at such long wavelength is quite strong , the thin platelike shape of the chosen crystal together with the large moment size ( ~ 7 @xmath33 of the eu@xmath4 spins make the neutron measurements feasible @xcite the crystal was mounted on an aluminum sample holder with very tiny amount of ge varnish .",
    "the [ 0 , 1 , 0 ] direction of the crystal was aligned perpendicular to the horizontal scattering plane so that the ( @xmath34 , 0 , @xmath35 ) reciprocal plane can be mapped out by rotating the sample . throughout this paper ,",
    "the orthorhombic notation ( space group @xmath36@xmath37@xmath37@xmath37 ) will be used for convenience .",
    "the incident neutron spins were polarized approximately parallel to the scattering vector @xmath38 ( @xmath3-polarization ) , since in case of multi - detectors covering a larger @xmath39-range it is impossible to have the polarization parallel to all different @xmath39 vectors simultaneously .",
    "the scattering intensities in the spin - flip ( sf ) and non - spin - flip ( nsf ) channels were collected , respectively , to conclude about the magnetic ground state of the eu@xmath4 moments . for @xmath3-polarization ,",
    "the scattering cross sections for nsf and sf processes read as @xmath40    and @xmath41 respectively , where @xmath42 denotes the coherent nuclear scattering and @xmath43 denotes the total spin incoherent scattering , whereas @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the components of the moment parallel and perpendicular to the scattering plane , respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath46 indicates that the magnetic scattering is only sensitive to the component of the moment perpendicular to @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , using @xmath3-polarization , the magnetic and nuclear scattering can be completely seperated into the sf and nsf channel , respectively .",
    "the xrms measurements were performed at the fe @xmath47 edge and ir @xmath9 edge at beamline i16 at the diamond light source ( oxford , uk).@xcite the incident radiation was linearly polarized parallel to the horizontal scattering plane ( @xmath48-polarization ) with the beam size of 0.2 mm ( horizontal ) @xmath31 0.03 mm ( vertical ) .",
    "the magnetic reflections were probed in the @xmath49 scattering channel in which the polarization of the diffracted beam is perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the crystal was mounted on a cu sample holder with some silver paint and then mounted in a closed - cycle cryostat on a six - circle kappa diffractometer .",

    "thus the eu@xmath4 magnetic structure here in the eu(fe@xmath50ir@xmath51)@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystal is identical to that in the parent compound and 6% ir - substitution for fe seems not enough to change the magnetic ground state of the eu sublattice .",

    "first of all , the origin of the resonance at the ir @xmath9 edge in in eu(fe@xmath50ir@xmath51)@xmath2as@xmath2 needs to be understood .",
    "note that the resonant x - ray scattering signal in the @xmath49 channel can originate from either the spin or orbital ordering and the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly coupled for 5@xmath10 ir .",
    "therefore , possible orbital contribution from ir to the observed ( 1 , 0 , 9 ) peak ca nt be excluded . in addition , it can also originate from some local structural distortion or preferred neighborhood around the ir atoms , which makes the scattering amplitude of ir anisotropic and leads to the resonant scattering at the ir @xmath9 edge . nevertheless , we speculate that it most likely results from the magnetic polarization of the ir 5@xmath10 states , due to two reasons .",
    "first , the resonant scattering set in below a relatively low temperature ( ~ 12 k),@xcite which is coincidentally close and comparable to the a - type afm transition temperature of eu , @xmath8=16 @xmath52 0.5 k. the discrepancy between @xmath11 and @xmath8 is likely due to the difference of the sample - heating effect between synchrotron x - rays and neutrons .",
    "it is noteworthy to point out that @xmath11 is determined from the synchrotron measurement and there is a strong sample - heating effect from the incident x - ray beam if no attenuators are applied in order to probe very weak effect,@xcite while@xmath8 is determined from the neutron diffraction measurement and the sample - heating effect is negligible . note that we only observed a single anomaly around 16 k at low temperature in the heat capacity measurement shown in fig.1(a ) and no hint for another transition around 12 k can be discernible .",
    "second , the resonant scattering occurs at the same wave vector as is typically observed for the magnetic order in the 122 iron pnictides , with the propagation vector @xmath73 = ( 1 , 0 , 1).@xcite    for superconducting ba(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , it was proposed that the ir 5@xmath10 states may be polarized by either the local field from the fe neighbors or by other indirect interactions between the ir and fe states and it was found by xrms that the ir magnetic order persists up to the nel transition of the majority fe spins.@xcite in eu(fe@xmath50ir@xmath51)@xmath2as@xmath2 , however , clear polarization of ir occurs at a much lower temperature @xmath11 = 12 @xmath52 0.5 k compared with that of the majority fe spins , @xmath6 = 85 @xmath52 2 k. comparison between ba(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 and eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 suggests a considerable effect of the @xmath12-site ion on the magnetic nature of the 5@xmath10 ir dopant atoms . since the xrms at the ir @xmath9 edge corresponds to the excitation of the 2 @xmath80 core electrons into the 5@xmath10 valence band of ir , which is hybridized with the 3@xmath10 valence band of fe through the chemical doping process",
    "as revealed by our previous electronic structure calculation performed on eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2,@xcite the polarization of the 5@xmath10 states of ir implies possible polarization of the fe 3@xmath10 band below @xmath11 ( @xmath81 ) induced by the magnetic order of eu .",
    "a similar effect was revealed in a previous study on eufe@xmath2(as@xmath82p@xmath83)@xmath2 using magnetic compton scattering ( mcs ) measurements , where the magnetism of fe is enhanced when the eu magnetic order sets in.@xcite the interplay between the localized eu@xmath4 moments and the conduction @xmath10-electrons on the feas layers were also observed before in the co - doped eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 based on nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and mssbauer spectroscopy measurements.@xcite however , in the parent compound , the coupling between the eu and fe sublattices was found to be negligible according to previous neutron and nonresonant x - ray magnetic scattering measurements.@xcite this is not contradictory since it was found that the interplay between 3 @xmath84 and 4 @xmath85 electrons is tunable by chemical doping in the iron pnictides cefe@xmath0co@xmath1aso and gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso.@xcite in addition , compared with xrms at the fe @xmath47 edge ( 1 @xmath86 @xmath87 4 @xmath88 ) , xrms at the ir @xmath9 edge is more sensitive to the change of the @xmath84-band electrons and thus can probe their interaction with the eu 4 @xmath85 electrons more effectively .",
    "therefore we believe that we have observed the evidence for possible interplay between the eu and fe sublattices upon 6% ir doping .",
    "in addition , doping more ir into the fe site is able to tune the magnetic ground state of the localized eu@xmath4 spins , from the a - type afm order in eu(fe~0.94~ir~0.06~)~2~as~2~ to the fm order in eu(fe~0.88~ir~0.12~)~2~as~2~,@xcite via the change of the indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction mediated by the conduction @xmath10-electrons on the feas layers.@xcite    in summary , we have performed the polarized neutron diffraction and x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) measurements on a underdoped , non - superconducting eu(fe@xmath0ir@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0.06 ) single crystal and found multiple phase transitions .",
    "the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition and the antiferromagnetic order of the fe@xmath4 moments are well seperated , significantly suppressed to @xmath5 = 111 ( 2 ) and @xmath6= 85 ( 2 ) k by 6% ir doping , respectively , compared with the parent compound .",
    "in addition , the eu@xmath4 spins order within the @xmath7 plane in the a - type antiferromagnetic structure similar to that in the parent compound .",
    "however , the order temperature is evidently suppressed to @xmath8= 16.0 ( 5 ) k by 6% ir doping .",
    "most strikingly , the xrms measurements at the ir @xmath9 edge demonstrates that the ir 5@xmath10 states are magnetically polarized with the same propagation vector as the magnetic order of fe . with @xmath11 = 12.0 ( 5 )",
    "k , they feature a much lower onset temperature compared with @xmath6 .",
    "our observation suggests that the magnetism of the eu sublattice has considerable effect on the magnetic nature of the 5@xmath10 ir dopant atoms and there exists a possible interplay between the localized eu@xmath4 moments and the conduction @xmath10-electrons on the feas layers .",
    "this work is based on experiments performed at the dns instrument operated by jlich centre for neutron science ( jcns ) at the heinz maier - leibnitz zentrum ( mlz ) , garching , germany and at the i16 beamline at the diamond light source , didcot , uk .",

    "the reason is that the magnetic polarization of the ir dopant atoms is a weak effect as evidenced in our xrms measurement and the ir moment is expected to be much smaller ( less than 1 @xmath16 as revealed in other iridates ) than that of eu ( close to 7 @xmath16 ) .",

    "when measuring the ( 1 , 0 , 9 ) resonant peak at the ir @xmath9 edge , we did not apply any attenuation for the synchrotron beam since the resonant signal was quite weak .",
    "it is therefore expected that the actual sample temperature might be higher than the measured value due to the non - instantaneous thermal conduction , so that @xmath11 might be somewhat underestimated by our xrms measurement . in our case , the strength of such beam - heating effect can be roughly estimated to produce a temperature difference of @xmath70 t @xmath77 5.7 k according to the heating power of the incident beam and the thermal conductivity of the sample by ignoring the influence of thermal convection and thermal radiation . therefore , a difference of 4 k between @xmath11 and @xmath8 is possible at low temperature considering the inaccuracy of our approximation .",
