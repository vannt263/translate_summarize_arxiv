    "transverse single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries in high - energy hadronic reactions have raised a lot of interest in the last years ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the huge spin asymmetries measured in the inclusive forward production of pions in high - energy @xmath1 collisions , at moderately large transverse momentum , can not be explained in the realm of leading - twist ( lt ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , based on the usual collinear factorization theorems .    out of the theoretical approaches proposed in order to account for these measurements , in the following we will adopt the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) formalism , which takes into account spin and intrinsic parton motion effects assuming a pqcd factorization scheme .",
    "single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries are generated by tmd polarized partonic distribution and fragmentation functions , among which the most relevant from a phenomenological point of view are the sivers distribution  @xcite and , for transversely polarized quarks , the boer - mulders distribution  @xcite and the collins fragmentation function  @xcite ( similar functions can be defined for linearly polarized gluons , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    along the lines of @xcite",
    ", we consider the process @xmath2 , presently under active investigation at rhic , where one observes a large @xmath0 jet and looks for the azimuthal distribution of leading pions inside the jet .",
    "a very preliminary version of this study was first presented in ref .",
    "a similar analysis was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which however considered intrinsic parton motion only in the fragmentation process , drastically reducing the possible contributions to the asymmetry .",
    "indeed , in that case , only the collins effect for quarks is at work .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite aimed at studying only the collins fragmentation function ( ff ) , which should be universal , in a more simplified theoretical scheme for which factorization has been proven .",
    "our approach is different in some respects .",
    "it is more general and has in principle a richer structure in the observable azimuthal asymmetries , since intrinsic motion is taken into account in the initial hadrons also .",
    "however , since factorization has not been proven in this case , but is rather taken as a reasonable phenomenological assumption , the validity of the scheme and the universality of the tmd distributions involved require an even more severe scrutiny by comparison with experimental results . on the other hand , at the present theoretical and experimental stage , we believe that combined phenomenological tests of different approaches are required to clarify the validity of factorization and , related to this , the relevance of possible universality - breaking terms for the tmd distributions .    the plan of this contribution is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - formalism ] we will briefly summarize the tmd generalized parton model approach and give the expression of the polarized cross section for the process of interest . in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] we will present phenomenological results for azimuthal asymmetries discussed in the kinematical configuration of the rhic experiments . sec .",
    "4 contains final remarks and conclusions .",
    "we denote with @xmath3 and @xmath4 two spin @xmath5 hadrons ( typically , two protons ) , with hadron @xmath4 unpolarized and hadron @xmath3 in a pure transverse spin state described by the four - vector @xmath6 . within a generalized tmd parton model approach ,",
    "the invariant differential cross section for the process @xmath7 can be written , at lt in the soft tmd functions , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the energy and three - momentum of the observed jet .",
    "we sum over all allowed partonic processes contributing to the physical process observed , and @xmath11 stays for a sum over all partonic helicities . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the initial parton light - cone momentum fractions and intrinsic transverse momenta .",
    "analogously , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the light - cone momentum fraction and the transverse momentum of the observed pion inside the jet w.r.t",
    ".   the jet ( parton @xmath16 ) direction of motion .",
    "all information on the polarization state of the initial parton @xmath17 is contained in @xmath18 , which depends in turn on the ( experimentally fixed ) parent hadron @xmath3 polarization state and on the soft , nonperturbative dynamics encoded in the eight leading - twist polarized and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions .",
    "@xmath19 is the helicity density matrix of parton @xmath17 .",
    "analogously , the polarization state of parton @xmath20 inside the unpolarized hadron @xmath4 is encoded into @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 s are the pqcd leading - order ( lo ) helicity scattering amplitudes for the hard partonic process @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 s are the soft leading - twist tmd fragmentation functions describing the fragmentation process of the scattered ( polarized ) parton @xmath16 into the final leading pion inside the jet .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we work in the @xmath25 hadronic c.m .",
    "frame , with hadron @xmath3 moving along the @xmath26 direction , and define @xmath27 as the production plane containing the colliding beams and the observed jet , with @xmath28 . in this frame @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 $ ] is the jet ( pseudo)rapidity .",
    "the calculation is performed by summing explicitly over all helicity indexes and inserting the appropriate expressions for the helicity density matrices of partons @xmath17 , @xmath20 and for the polarized distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "after factorizing explicitly all azimuthal dependences , including those coming from the hard - scattering helicity amplitudes , collecting them and using symmetry properties under @xmath32 @xcite , one gets the final expression for the single transverse polarized cross section .",
    "this will have the following general structure : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle of the pion three - momentum around the jet direction of motion , as measured in the fragmenting parton helicity frame .",
    "the latter frame is related to the hadronic c.m .",
    "frame by a simple rotation by @xmath35 around @xmath36 @xcite .    in terms of the polarized cross section in eq .",
    "( [ d - sig - phi - sa ] ) , we can define average values of appropriate circular functions of @xmath37 and @xmath34 , in order to single out the different contributions of interest : @xmath38 alternatively , for the single spin asymmetry we can , in close analogy with the case of semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , define appropriate azimuthal moments , @xmath39 } { \\int{\\rm d}\\phi_{s_a}{\\rm d}\\phi_\\pi^h\\ , [ { \\rm d}\\sigma(\\phi_{s_a},\\phi_\\pi^h)+ { \\rm d}\\sigma(\\phi_{s_a}+\\pi,\\phi_\\pi^h)]}\\ , , \\label{gen - mom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is again some appropriate circular function of @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "in this section we present and discuss some phenomenological implications of our approach for the unpolarized and single - transverse polarized cases in kinematical configurations accessible at rhic by the star and phenix experiments .",
    "we consider both central ( @xmath41 ) and forward ( @xmath42 ) ( pseudo)rapidity configurations at a c.m .",
    "energy @xmath43 200 gev ( different c.m .",
    "energies , namely @xmath44 and 500 gev , are also studied in @xcite ) , aiming at a check of the potentiality of the approach in disentangling among different quark and gluon originating effects .",
    "we will first consider , for @xmath45 production only , a scenario in which the effects of all tmd functions are over - maximized . by this",
    "we mean that all tmd functions are maximized in size by imposing natural positivity bounds ( and the soffer bound for transversity  @xcite ) ; moreover , the relative signs of all active partonic contributions are chosen so that they sum up additively .",
    "in this way we set an upper bound on the absolute value of any of the effects playing a potential role in the azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "therefore , all effects that are negligible or even marginal in this scenario may be directly discarded in subsequent refined phenomenological analyses .    as a second step in our study we consider , for both neutral and charged pions , only the surviving effects , involving tmd functions for which parameterizations are available from independent fits to other spin and azimuthal asymmetries data in sidis , drell - yan , and @xmath46 processes .    for numerical calculations",
    "all tmd distribution and fragmentation functions will be taken in the simplified form where the functional dependences on the parton light - cone momentum fraction and on transverse motion are completely factorized , assuming a gaussian - like flavour - independent shape for the transverse momentum component .",
    "concerning the parameterizations of the transversity and quark sivers distributions , and of the collins functions , we will consider two sets : sidis  1 @xcite and sidis  2 @xcite .",
    "notice that the almost unknown gluon sivers function was tentatively taken positive and saturated to an updated version of the bound obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering phenix data for the @xmath47 transverse ssa at mid - rapidity production in polarized @xmath1 collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the usual collinear distributions , we adopt the lo unpolarized set grv98  @xcite and ( for the soffer bound ) the corresponding longitudinally polarized set grsv2000  @xcite . for fragmentation functions",
    ", we will adopt two well - known lo sets among those available in the literature , the set by kretzer  @xcite and the dss one  @xcite .",
    "our choice is dictated by the subsequent use of the two available parametrization sets for the sivers and collins functions in our scheme , that have been extracted in the past years by adopting these sets of ffs .",
    "since the range of the jet transverse momentum ( the hard scale ) covered is significant , we take into account proper evolution with scale . concerning transversity , in the maximized scenario",
    "we will fix it at the initial scale by saturating the soffer bound and then letting it evolve . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse momentum component of all tmd functions is kept fixed with no evolution with scale .",
    "notice that at this stage evolution properties of the full tmd functions are not known .    in all cases considered , since we are interested in azimuthal asymmetries for leading particles inside the jet , we will present results obtained integrating the light - cone momentum fraction of the observed hadron , @xmath14 , in the range @xmath48 .      the symmetric part @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ d - sig - phi - sa ] ) gets contributions by the usual unpolarized term , already present in the collinear approach , and by an additional term involving a boer - mulders@xmath51boer - mulders convolution for the initial quarks ( or the analogous terms involving linearly polarized gluons ) ; however even in the maximized scenario this last contribution is always negligible in all the kinematical configurations considered , hence we will not discuss it anymore in the sequel .    in fig .",
    "[ asy - unp-200 ] we show the maximized @xmath52 and @xmath53 asymmetries for @xmath45 production in the central ( left panel ) and forward ( right panel ) rapidity regions as a function of @xmath54 , from @xmath55 gev up to the maximum allowed value , adopting the kretzer ff set .",
    "similar results are obtained using the dss set .",
    "the @xmath56 asymmetry is generated by the quark boer - mulders@xmath51collins convolution term , involving a transversely polarized quark and an unpolarized hadron both in the initial state and in the fragmentation process .",
    "the @xmath57 asymmetry is related to the term involving linearly polarized gluons and unpolarized hadrons both in the initial state and in the fragmentation process , that is the convolution of a boer - mulders - like gluon distribution with a collins - like gluon ff .",
    "even the maximized contribution is practically negligible in the kinematical configurations considered .          in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - siv - max200 ] we show the total observable sivers asymmetry , and the corresponding quark and gluon contributions for @xmath45 production , in the maximized scenario and adopting the kretzer ff set , as a function of @xmath54 in the central ( left panel ) and forward ( right panel ) rapidity regions .",
    "the maximized potential sivers asymmetry can be very large in both cases . in the central rapidity region ,",
    "the asymmetry is dominated by the gluon contribution at the lowest @xmath54 range while gets comparable quark and gluon contributions in the large @xmath54 range . a large sivers asymmetry around @xmath60 gev",
    "could then be a clear indication for a sizable gluon contribution . in the forward rapidity region , on the contrary , the quark and gluon contributions are comparable at low @xmath54 values , while the maximized asymmetry is dominated by the quark contribution for @xmath61 gev .",
    "therefore , a large sivers asymmetry in this kinematical range could be ascribed unambiguosly to the quark sivers effect .         in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - siv - par200 ] we show , for both neutral and charged pions , the quark and gluon contributions to the sivers asymmetry , obtained adopting the parametrization sets sidis  1 and sidis  2 , and the updated version of the bound on the gluon sivers asymmetry derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the forward rapidity region , as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "the dotted black vertical line delimits the region @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , beyond which the sidis parameterizations for the quark sivers distribution are extrapolated outside the @xmath64 region covered by sidis data and are therefore plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "this reflects on the fact that below this limit the two sets give comparable results , while above it they differ remarkably .",
    "therefore , a measurement of this asymmetry might help in clarifying the behaviour of the quark sivers distribution in the large @xmath64 region , which plays a fundamental role for forward pion production at rhic , and is not covered by present sidis data from hermes and compass experiments .",
    "the quark generated asymmetry @xmath67 comes from two distinct contributions : one involving the convolution between the term of the tmd transversity distribution suppressed in the collinear configuration and the collins function ; another term involving the convolution of the sivers and boer - mulders distributions for the initial quarks with the collins function for the final quark [ an analogous term appears also in the @xmath68 asymmetry ] .",
    "we have explicitly checked that for the kinematical configurations under study both these contributions are always negligible already in the maximized scenario .",
    "therefore we will not consider the @xmath69 asymmetry in the sequel .",
    "a similar situation holds also for the gluon generated @xmath70 asymmetry , where two contributions analogous to the quark ones discussed above but for linearly polarized gluons are involved .                in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - coll - max200 ] we present the quark @xmath68 collins asymmetry and the gluon @xmath71 collins - like asymmetry in the maximized scenario in the central ( left panel ) and forward ( right panel ) rapidity region as a function of @xmath54 , from @xmath55 gev up to the maximum allowed value , adopting the kretzer ff set . in the central rapidity region",
    "the quark collins asymmetry is very small at the lowest @xmath54 values , then increases almost linearly reaching about 8% at the upper range . instead ,",
    "in the forward rapidity region the asymmetry is ( potentially ) always large and increases almost linearly from about 25% to about 70% going from the lowest to the largest @xmath54 values .",
    "concerning the gluon collins - like asymmetry , both in the central and in the forward rapidity regions it is of the order of 5% at the lowest @xmath54 values , then starts decreasing slowly and becomes negligible at large @xmath54 values .",
    "similar results hold when adopting the dss set .",
    "we consider now , for both neutral and charged pions , numerical results for the quark collins asymmetry obtained adopting the parameterizations sidis  1 and sidis  2 for the transversity distribution and the collins fragmentation function ( no parameterizations are available yet in the analogous gluon case ) .",
    "it turns out that in the central rapidity region all the estimated asymmetries are practically negligible . concerning the forward rapidity region , our results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ asy - an - coll - par200 ] .",
    "the collins asymmetry for neutral pions results to be almost vanishing . for charged pions , similarly to the case of the sivers asymmetry , the two parameterizations give comparable results only in the @xmath54 region where the transversity distribution is reasonably constrained by sidis data ( see the dotted black vertical line ) .",
    "a measurement of this asymmetry would be then very important and helpful in clarifying the large @xmath64 behaviour of the quark transversity distribution .",
    "we have presented a study of the azimuthal asymmetries measurable in the distribution of leading pions inside a large-@xmath0 jet produced in unpolarized and single - transverse polarized proton proton collisions for kinematical configurations accessible at rhic . to this end",
    ", we have adopted a generalized tmd parton model approach with inclusion of spin and intrinsic parton motion effects both in the distribution and in the fragmentation sectors .",
    "in contrast to inclusive pion production , where the sivers and collins mechanisms can not be separated @xcite , and in close analogy with the sidis case , the leading - twist azimuthal asymmetries discussed above allow one to discriminate among different effects by taking suitable moments of the asymmetries . in principle ,",
    "quark and gluon originating jets can also be distinguished , at least in some kinematical regimes .",
    "hence , the proposed phenomenological analysis could be very helpful , for example , in clarifying the role played by the quark(gluon ) sivers distribution and by the collins(-like ) fragmentation function in the sizable single spin asymmetries observed at rhic for forward pion production . at the same time",
    "it will give us the opportunity of testing the factorization and universality assumptions , and of gaining information on the size and _ sign _ of the tmd functions discussed , in a kinematic region not covered by sidis data .",
    "we finally stress that the unambiguous measurement of any of the asymmetries , other than the collins one , discussed above would be a clear indication of the role played by intrinsic parton motion in the initial hadrons for the spin asymmetry sector in polarized hadronic collisions .",
