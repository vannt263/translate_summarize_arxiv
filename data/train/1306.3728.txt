    "in our first paper on this subject matter @xcite we studied a model of @xmath0 quantum oscillators ( qo ) located at different fixed positions in space , which do not interact with each other directly but only through weak couplings to a common scalar massless quantum field .",
    "after coarse - graining the quantum field we derived the late - time covariance matrix of the open system of the @xmath0 oscillators with field - induced coupling and analyzed the structure of their quantum entanglement behavior for the case of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that in the weak coupling limit the correlations adopt a simple pairwise structure , in that the correlation between any two qo is ignorant of the presence of the other qo .",
    "the effects of field - induced interaction on quantum entanglement between two harmonic oscillators have been studied earlier in @xcite .",
    "one interesting new feature shown there is the distance dependence of quantum entanglement , since the coupling is mediated by a quantum field whose influence varies with time and space .",
    "the way how one oscillator s presence alters the entanglement of the other two was used in @xcite to capture a novel notion called ` entanglement domain ' . in this paper",
    "we study the entanglement structure of the @xmath0 quantum oscillator system but in addition to each oscillator s weak coupling with a common quantum scalar field we allow also direct pairwise couplings with varying strength .",
    "the salient features based on detailed studies of the @xmath1 case turn out to be quite different from the case of @xmath0 oscillators with only field - induced coupling .",
    "the first entanglement feature , namely , that the correlation between any two qo are ignorant of the presence of the other qo , is no longer true . the second feature , namely , distance dependence of entanglement due to each oscillator s coupling to a quantum field , is now no longer prominent , being overwhelmed by the direct couplings .",
    "we see that each case studied in these two papers captures one aspect of the overall behavior of the system of nos ( with @xmath1 studied in detail here ) : while the first case may depict neutral atoms the latter case depicts ions ( in an open quantum field rather than in a cavity or in a trap ) .",
    "the idealized model - study here , though not a replica of actual experimental setups , can nonetheless provide us with a clear theoretical understanding and quantitative description of the entanglement structure of such commonly encountered continuous - variable quantum systems .    quantifying the entanglement structure of a many - body quantum system can facilitate investigations into related issues in several current research areas .",
    "for example , the results reported in this paper for a system of @xmath0 coupled oscillators with direct yet disparate couplings can help shed light on issues in _ macroscopic quantum phenomena _ ( mqp ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "entanglement being an exclusively quantum feature @xcite , it is natural to ask how to use entanglement as a signifier or marker of the existence of , or further , a quantitative measure of , the quantum features and behaviors in a macroscopic quantum system . on this issue",
    "it is important to recognize that ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) there exist many _ levels of structure _ in a composite body and only by judicious choice of an appropriate set of _ collective variables _ can one give a good description of the dynamics of a specific level of structure .",
    "these are often characterized by strong coupling between fine - grained elements or constituents in one particular level of structure ( e.g. the level of quarks / gluons or the level of nucleons ) and weaker coupling between the elements in a coarser - grained level of structure ( e.g. , atoms or molecules ) . capturing the quantum features of a macroscopic object is greatly facilitated by the existence and functioning of these collective variables depicting a specific level of structure . under what conditions",
    "can one capture the quantum dynamics of an @xmath0 oscillator system by its center of mass ( com ) , the so - called  com axiom \" , was investigated earlier by chou et al @xcite who derived a sufficient condition for this to hold .",
    "a recent essay @xcite ( see also cited work therein e.g. , @xcite ) showed the marked difference between entanglement within one specific level of structure and entanglement between different levels of structure , and identified which types would scale with @xmath0 .",
    "these two aspects , namely , the role of the com in a many - body system and how the level - of - structure enter in the manifestation of macroscopic quantum phenomena , can be examined by using the entanglement structure results obtained here for a three - oscillator system with disparate coupling strengths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we derive a set of langevin equations for @xmath0 coupled quantum oscillators interacting with a quantum scalar field based on the influence functional formalism approach .",
    "this method first introduced by feynman and vernon @xcite for the study of quantum brownian motion has been applied to the derivation of markovian and non - markovian master equations for oscillator baths @xcite and for a quantum field environment @xcite .",
    "( for an alternative treatment of a @xmath0 oscillator system , see @xcite and references therein . ) here we take the direct route of seeking solutions to the evolutionary operator of the reduced density matrix given formally by grabert et al @xcite for the derivation of correlation functions .",
    "( for an alternative derivation of the non - markovian master equation and finding their solutions , see @xcite and references therein . ) in sec .",
    "3 these are used to construct the covariance matrix of this system which is at the heart of our analysis of quantum entanglement . in sec .",
    "4 we specialize to @xmath1 with disparate coupling and analyze the symmetric and asymmetric configurations described above . in sec .",
    "5 we summarize our results and briefly describe their implications for some key issues in mqp and applications in other areas .",
    "the appendix contains more details about symmetric gaussian systems .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 interacting @xmath2 detectors where each detector s internal degree of freedom @xmath3 is described by a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "these detectors are allowed to have direct coupling via their internal degrees of freedom , and the coupling is assumed to be at most quadratic in the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , each oscillator is coupled to one and the same massless scalar field @xmath4 which acts as an environment to the @xmath0 oscillator system .",
    "as such there will be indirect interactions between the oscillators mediated by the shared bath .",
    "the entanglement features of such a system with only field - induced interaction was studied in our first paper @xcite .    for later purpose when we will consider a system of @xmath0 moving detectors ( such as that studied before in @xcite ) we can allow the detectors to be in motion with the trajectory of the @xmath5 detector specified by @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "since we are primarily interested in the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom @xmath12 of the detectors , obtaining the evolution of their reduced density matrix of @xmath22 constructed by integrating over the scalar field environment will serve our purpose .",
    "this enables us to find the corresponding time evolution of the expectation value of an operator @xmath23 associated with the detector s internal degrees of freedom by @xmath24 where @xmath25 means taking the trace over a complete set of @xmath26 states .",

    "in the pure state cases , if a state @xmath196 can be written as a product of pure states such as @xmath197 for @xmath198 and @xmath199 in a bipartite system , then it is called a product state or a separable state .",

    "a famous example of an entangled state for a bipartite system is the bell state @xmath201 where @xmath202 , @xmath203 are two possible outcomes of a qubit state .",

    "the answer is provided by the singular value decomposition .",
    "it says that for every complex matrix @xmath209 , there always exist unitary transformations @xmath210 and @xmath211 such that @xmath212 is diagonal with real , non - negative diagonal elements .",
    "thus for each state @xmath208 , we can always find suitable bases @xmath213 and @xmath214 in terms of which reduces to @xmath215 where the @xmath216 are known as schmidt coefficients , and the upper limit of the sum is determined by the dimension of the smaller subsystem .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that , compared with , if there is only one nonvanishing schmidt coefficient , then the state @xmath208 is a separable state , and vice versa .",
    "since the singular values @xmath216 are uniquely defined , the number of schmidt coefficients provides a convenient criterion of separability of a state .    in realistic situations we more often have to deal with mixed states , such as , when we consider an open quantum system , which interacts with an environment .",
    "due to its huge number of degrees of freedom we can not track all the details of the motion of the environment . if what we need is the overall effect of the environment on the system we can trace out the environment in a fashion similar to and obtain a reduced description for the state of the open system which is usually mixed .",
    "for the mixed state cases , the density matrix of a quantum system takes on the generic form @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a set of complete bases for the system .",
    "the weight @xmath219 is the probability of findng the system in the state @xmath218 .",
    "unitarity requires that @xmath220 a well - known simple criterion for discerning a mixed state from a pure one is : given the density matrix of the state @xmath171 , if the state is pure , the trace of @xmath221 is equal to 1 .",
    "one the other hand , if it is a mixed state , then the trace is less than 1 , that is , @xmath222    the simplest mixed state for a bipartite system is described by the so - called mixed product state @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the density matrices of the respective subsystems . more generally , the joint system can be described by a convex sum of different product states @xmath226 with @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the corresponding state is called the separable mixed state . from this definition ,",
    "if a mixed state of a bipartite system can not be expressed as , then the state is entangled .",
    "in other words , a mixed state @xmath171 is entangled if there are no states @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and non - negative value of @xmath231 , such that @xmath171 can be expressed as a convex sum like .",

    "this is the positive - partial - transpose ( ppt ) separability criterion .",
    "thus , in principle , if we find a negative eigenvalue for the partially transposed density matrix , then the corresponding state is entangled .",
    "the sufficient condition of the separability criterion , on the other hand , is valid only for low - dimensional bipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "this powerful criterion is further extended to an @xmath233 bi - partitions of the @xmath234-mode bi - symmetric gaussian system  @xcite .",
    "both sufficient and necessary conditions apply to such a gaussian system .",
    "when we deal with a system described by continuous variables , the criterion based on the density matrix of the system becomes inconvenient to work with because the dimension of the density matrix for continuous variables is usually infinite .",
    "this is where the covariance matrix finds its use .      when translated into the covariance matrix , the partial transpose of the density matrix is equivalent to the mirror reflection of the canonical momentum in the corresponding subsystem",
    "let the mirror reflection operator be @xmath235 .",
    "the peres - horodecki positive partial transpose criterion  @xcite then says @xmath236 because when @xmath237 is a bona fide density matrix , @xmath238 will be a bona fide covariance matrix , and then eq",
    ".   implies eq .  .",
    "conversely , the entanglement criterion  @xcite then says that if the state is entangled , the partial transpose of its density matrix is negative , or equivalently the symplectic values @xmath239 of the corresponding partially transposed covariance matrix can be smaller than @xmath193 .    a simple and computable entanglement measure known as ` negativity '",
    "is defined based on the idea that if one of the eigenvalues @xmath240 of @xmath237 is negative , then @xmath171 is entangled  @xcite .",

    "however , due to the limitation of the positive - partial - transpose ( ppt ) criterion  @xcite , the negativity is fully valid only for low - dimensional systems such as a @xmath178 or a @xmath243 system .",
    "an alternative entanglement measure , which is often used for the continuous - variable system , is a variant of the logarithmic negativity @xmath244",
    "it basically collects the symplectic eigenvalues of the partially - transposed covariance matrix , which are smaller than @xmath193 , @xmath245 the equal sign can be satisfied by the ppt entangled state  @xcite because in higher dimensions there are entangled states which have a positive partial - transposed density matrix operator .",

    "<S> we analyze the entanglement between one oscillator and the other two with equal ( symmetric ) and unequal ( asymmetric ) coupling strengths . as an illustration we use the results for these two different configurations to address two representative issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention possible extensions of our work and applications of our analysis and results to issues in some current areas of research in quantum thermodynamics and mesoscopic quantum systems .    quantum entanglement , open quantum systems , macroscopic quantum phenomena , influence functional formalism , quantum field theory , quantum brownian motion , non - markovian dynamics </S>"
