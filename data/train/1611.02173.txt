    "the four different phases that appear in the phase diagram of the pseudoscalar and vector order parameters coupled to a magnetization order parameter have a peculiar character on the fermi surface .",

    "the gap then reads @xmath143 it is clear that only the gap @xmath144 can be zero on a given point @xmath145 of the fermi surface . due to so(3 ) symmetry",
    "we can choose for simplicity @xmath146 , so that by writing @xmath147 the gap reads @xmath148 one has a node on the north pole @xmath149 and a node on the south pole @xmath150 on the fermi sphere .",

    "these nodes can not be gapped unless nodes with opposite topological charge are brought into contact .",
    "we can see this in more details by expanding the hamiltonian in the reduced subspace of the conduction band for small momentum @xmath154 around the the nodal points . for @xmath115",
    "these are the north and south pole @xmath155 , and the hamiltonian reads @xmath156,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 .",
    "we see that the hamiltonian splits into two weyl sub - blocks coupled by a mass term @xmath158 and the resulting eigenvalues give rise to two gapped bands at @xmath159 and two gapless bands .",

    "the quadratic crossing splits into two linear crossing with @xmath125 in the north hemisphere and two linear crossing with @xmath172 in the north hemisphere it follows that by increasing @xmath9 one moves the weyl nodes toward the equator and for @xmath120 one has that weyl nodes of opposite charge are brought into contact and split , so that for @xmath121 the system is fully gapped .    in the plane @xmath171 the nodes are located at @xmath173 .",

    "if @xmath66 and @xmath87 , then we always get @xmath311 and a nematic phase , since both terms that contain @xmath302 want it to be as small as possible .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath87 then there is a competition between @xmath65 which favors the chiral solution and @xmath78 which favors the nematic solution .",
    "the value of @xmath302 is obtained from @xmath312 which gives the solution @xmath313 which interpolates between nematic and the standard chiral as @xmath302 goes from 0 to 1 .",
    "finally , if @xmath67 and @xmath81 one has @xmath311 and @xmath314 , that corresponds to a solution in which @xmath10 is real and @xmath315 ."
