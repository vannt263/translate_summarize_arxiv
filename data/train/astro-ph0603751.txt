    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) contains structure at many scales , and the growth of much of this structure is believed to represent the first step in initiating galactic star formation . in particular ,",
    "the molecular portion of the ism is concentrated into dense clouds over a range of scales @xcite ; each of these clouds also contains significant higher - density substructure .",
    "the largest of these cloud complexes ( up to @xmath5 , including atomic envelopes ) contain most of the mass in the overall distribution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . in galaxies with prominent spiral structure ,",
    "gmcs tend to be concentrated into the spiral arms .",
    "observationally , the higher - than - average specific star formation rates ( i.e.  per unit gas mass ) within spiral arms @xcite suggests an evolutionary sequence : compression of diffuse gas ( and/or collection of smaller clouds ) within the arms prompts gmc formation , and star formation is subsequently triggered in the densest portions within gmcs .    from a theoretical point of view , interaction of the ism with spiral arms should naturally result in bound cloud formation when the mean density is high enough that self - gravitating instabilities are able to grow .",
    "the growth of self - gravitating structures in spiral arms has been investigated by many authors , using both linear - theory analyses @xcite and more recently , nonlinear hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations that yield bound clouds with properties similar to observed gmcs ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .    interestingly , self - gravity acting on the gas within spiral arms can apparently also lead to growth of structures larger than gmcs .",
    "these structures take the shape of gaseous spurs that project from the main body of the arm into the interarm region .",
    "the first direct numerical simulations showing the development of these trailing spurs ( paper i ) occurred contemporaneously with the release of the now - famous _ hubble heritage _ image of m51 @xcite , in which strikingly similar structures are evident .",
    "furthermore , a recent _ spitzer legacy _ image of m51 displays a quasi - regular distribution of thin , trailing dust filaments throughout the interarm regions @xcite .",
    "the dust filaments seen in these images could well be the remnants of gaseous spurs initiated inside spiral arms , which have maintained their integrity deep into the interarm regions .",
    "a recent archival study of hst galaxy images ( lavigne , vogel , & ostriker 2006 , in preparation ) has shown that arm substructures of the kind seen in m51 are in fact ubiquitous in the grand design spirals where the global pattern is clean enough to make identification of spiral spur substructures possible . when identified as a regular series of dust lanes extending out of a primary dust lane across the bright stellar arm and into the interarm region ,",
    "such spur structures have historically been termed `` feathers '' @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we extend the ( thin disk ) two - dimensional numerical models of paper i into three dimensions , in order to study the effects of vertical stratification on the development of condensation instabilities in spiral arms . in our previous work",
    ", we argued that self - gravity , aided by magnetic fields , is the key to gaseous spur and dense cloud formation .",
    "however , it has recently been proposed that kelvin - helmholtz instabilities are also able to trigger spiral arm spur formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , a theoretical proposal with a long history is that parker instabilities in spiral arms may be important in prompting gmc formation ( e.g. @xcite ; see discussion and references in @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "our three - dimensional models allow us to explore both of these proposals using more realistic numerical set - ups than in previous work .",
    "we shall show that , for vertically stratified magnetized disks , qualitatively quite similar results to the conclusions of paper i appear to hold .",
    "quantitatively , we shall also show that the three - dimensional results are consistent with results of two - dimensional models when `` thick - disk '' dilution of gravity is incorporated .",
    "we also find that three - dimensional dynamics tends to suppress the growth of kelvin - helmholtz - driven spurs described by @xcite based on unmagnetized two - dimensional simulations , and that there are no clear signatures of parker instability in our models .",
    "star formation takes place within molecular clouds , and at least the most massive gmcs that dominate the distribution appear to live for significantly less than a galactic orbital time , based on their close association with spiral arms @xcite .",
    "thus , the galactic star formation rate @xmath6 at a given radius can be written as a cloud formation rate @xmath7 times a star formation efficiency per cloud lifetime , @xmath8 . to the extent that this star formation efficiency depends primarily on physical processes within a cloud , understanding the regulation of star formation",
    "can therefore be separated into a large - scale ( galaxy ) and a small - scale ( gmc ) problem .",
    "the current work primarily addresses the large - scale problem by investigating the mechanisms and timescales required for diffuse gas to be gathered into bound clouds in the case when strong spiral structure is present .",
    "it also informs the small - scale problem by ascertaining the properties ( in terms of masses , magnetic fluxes , and spins ) of the bound clouds that form , which affect the star formation efficiency .",
    "a complete theory of cloud formation should start from initial conditions that would be left by the previous generation of clouds , in which feedback from star formation has taken its toll .",
    "clouds may be partially destroyed by photoevaporation and partly disaggregated by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "we defer this more complex treatment for the future , here taking the first step of considering cloud formation in a medium that is initially relatively uniform in its large - scale properties .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we lay out our numerical methods and the specifications of the models we shall study . in  3 ,",
    "we present results for two - dimensional `` thick disk gravity '' models , in which both magneto - jeans instability ( see paper i ) and the `` wiggle instability '' of @xcite can develop , depending on parameters . in  4 , we present the results of three - dimensional stratified models , identifying the conditions under which spurs and clouds form via various different self - gravitating mechanisms ( but not through the `` wiggle instability '' ) . in  5 , we conclude with a summary of our new results , and a discussion of their implications within the larger context of current work on galactic structure and star formation .",
    "in this paper , we study the nonlinear evolution of vertically stratified , differentially rotating , self - gravitating , magnetized galactic gas disks under spiral stellar potentials using local , three - dimensional numerical simulations",
    ". similar work in a two - dimensional , razor - thin disk geometry was reported in paper i , while three - dimensional evolution of gas in the absence of the spiral potential perturbation was studied in paper ii . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the numerical methods and model parameters that we adopt ; the reader is refereed to papers i and ii for the more complete description .",
    "we study the nonlinear evolution of self - gravitating gas under the influence of a stellar spiral potential that is tightly wound with a pitch angle @xmath9 , and rigidly rotating at a constant pattern speed @xmath10 with respect to an inertial frame . for local simulations ( i.e. domain @xmath11 ) involving spiral arms , it is advantageous to construct a local cartesian frame centered on a position @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , that corotates with the stellar spiral pattern .",
    "the local cartesian frame is inclined with respect to the @xmath15 , @xmath16 coordinate directions by an angle @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the directions in the midplane perpendicular and parallel , respectively , to the local segment of the spiral arm , while @xmath20 denotes the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",

    "we assume that the gas velocity @xmath31 induced by the spiral potential is much smaller than @xmath32 , and neglect terms arising from curvature effects in the coordinates ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this local , rotating frame",

    "we integrate the time - dependent , ideal mhd equations ( [ con])-([ext_pot ] ) using a modified version of the zeus code @xcite .",
    "it uses a time - explicit , operator - split , finite - difference scheme for solving the mhd equations on a staggered mesh , and employs the `` constrained transport '' and `` method of characteristics '' algorithms to maintain the divergence free condition of magnetic fields as well as to ensure accurate propagation of alfvn waves . for less diffusive transport of hydrodynamic variables ,",
    "we apply a velocity decomposition method in updating @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "we have parallelized the numerical code we use with both open - mp and mpi , for use on both shared- and distributed - memory platforms .",
    "the parallelization is achieved by domain decomposition along the @xmath43-direction , which is convenient for our hybrid technique of solving the poisson equation .",

    "the ism in galaxies is highly inhomogeneous , turbulent , and multi - phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a fully realistic treatment of ism evolution entails consideration of heating , cooling , and other physical processes that may significantly affect the density and temperature structures of the gas ( e.g , @xcite ) . in order to focus on the role of self - gravity in forming intermediate - scale spiral - arm substructure , we instead consider for all models presented in this paper homogeneous initial gas distributions , adopting a simple isothermal equation of state with an `` effective '' speed of sound @xmath61 .",

    "the quasi - radial size of the simulation domain is therefore @xmath98 kpc .",
    "to simulate various galactic conditions , we select the following three sets of the parameters : ( @xmath77 , @xmath83 , @xmath99 , 5% ) , ( 1.5 , 10 , 5% ) , and ( 1.2 , 1 , 10% ) . for our fiducial @xmath12 and @xmath28 , and taking @xmath100 , the corresponding gas surface density , total gas mass @xmath101 contained in the simulation box , and scale height @xmath26 are 11@xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 pc for the @xmath105 model with @xmath106 ; 13@xmath102 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 pc for the @xmath109 model with @xmath110 ; and 16@xmath102 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 pc for the @xmath113 model with @xmath114 . for the @xmath114 and 10 models , the respective midplane magnetic field strengths are @xmath115 g and @xmath116 g , respectively .",

    "we also briefly consider , in  4.2.4 , development of a model which is unstable to quasi - axisymmetric disturbances .",
    "paper i studied the formation of spiral - arm and interarm substructure in two - dimensional disks that were treated as being infinitesimally thin .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the thin - disk approximation of paper i is that it overestimates self - gravity at the disk midplane for modes whose wavelengths approach the disk scale height ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a given strength of the spiral arm potential , therefore",
    ", razor - thin disks tend to have larger density enhancement at the spiral shock than vertically - resolved disks , increasing the susceptibility to gravitational instability .",
    "consequently , the critical @xmath82 values for stable , one - dimensional spiral shock configurations are lower in razor - thin disks than in more realistic vertically extended disks ; to ensure gravitational stability to quasi - axisymmetric perturbations , razor - thin disk models considered in paper i were limited to @xmath117 for a range of @xmath77 and @xmath83 values .",
    "we revisit two - dimensional disk models here , now taking into account the geometrical dilution of self - gravity due to finite disk thickness . instead of the standard kernel appropriate for a thin disk",
    ", we use a `` thick - disk '' gravitational kernel such that the potential and density fourier modes with wavenumber @xmath118 at the midplane are related by @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 , where the disk scale height @xmath26 is held fixed in both space and time .",
    "equation ( [ kernel ] ) is in fact exact for an exponential density distribution @xmath122 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and generally yields a result within 15% of the exact solution of the three - dimensional poisson equation for self - consistent vertical equilibria ( paper ii ) . for our two - dimensional models , the dependences of all fluid variables on the vertical coordinate are neglected .",
    "the results of these two - dimensional disk models allow us to quantify the impact of thick - disk gravity on the formation of arm / interarm substructure without the potential influence of dynamical instabilities that critically involve the vertical dimension .",

    "the width @xmath127 of the gaseous spiral arm defined at @xmath128+{\\rm min}[\\sigma])/2 $ ] is listed in column ( 8) . finally , the mean separation ( @xmath129 ) of the structures that develop in each model is given in column ( 9 ) in terms of the arm - to - arm distance @xmath130 and in column ( 10 ) in terms of the normalized wavenumber @xmath131 , where the local , thin - disk jeans wavelength at the arm density peak is defined by @xmath132 note that structures that form from magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) in a featureless , uniform , low - shear , razor - thin disk favor @xmath133 @xcite , while mji - driven fragmentation occurring inside spiral arms in the razor - thin limit was found to have @xmath134 ( paper i ) .    to initiate our models , we begin with a disk having a uniform shear profile expressed by equation ( [ v0 ] ) , and uniform surface density and magnetic fields corresponding to the chosen values of @xmath77 and @xmath83 . using a one - dimensional grid in @xmath135 , we turn on the external spiral potential and slowly increase its amplitude up to a desired level , @xmath82 .",
    "this yields a one - dimensional equilibrium spiral shock profile , which we then use to initialize our two - dimensional simulations . on top of the background profile , we apply density perturbations created by a gaussian random field with flat power for @xmath136 and zero power for @xmath137 .",
    "the standard deviation of the density perturbations is fixed to be 3% in real space .",
    "we then follow the two - dimensional flow as perturbations evolve and grow through interaction with the background spiral shock , eventually forming self - gravitating substructures .",
    "note that an alternative initialization procedure is simply to start with a uniformly - shearing disk , and slowly turn on the spiral forcing term ; this is the procedure we follow for our three - dimensional models ( see  4 ) , and we have also tested two - dimensional models with this method .",
    "we find , for our two - dimensional models , essentially the same end results regardless of the initialization procedure .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the evolution of model me2d1 ( and its lower - resolution counterparts me2d2 - 3 ) , which have equipartition magnetic fields . in these simulations , gaseous spurs and gravitationally bound clouds form as a direct consequence of mji operating within spiral arms . the phrase ` bound clouds ' in this paper refers to gaseous clumps that would collapse in a runaway fashion if physical processes such as turbulence , fragmentation , or star formation did not subsequently limit this collapse .",
    "we note that if the razor - thin gravitational kernel had been used ( i.e. @xmath138 in eq .",
    "[ [ kernel ] ] ) , then the spiral shocks produced by this set of model parameters ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath139 ) would have been gravitationally unstable to quasi - axisymmetric perturbations . instead , with nonzero disk thickness , a quasi - axisymmetric , stable shock configuration is possible at a value of @xmath139 .",
    "figure [ evol2d ] plots time evolution of the maximum surface density of model me2d1 ( together with other two - dimensional models with different field strength ) , while figure [ mhd1pat ] shows snapshots of model me2d1 at @xmath140 and 3.2 .",
    "the perturbations introduced into the flow shear around and relax initially ( @xmath141 ) , and then various modes begin to grow due to self - gravity ( @xmath142 ) . in the absence of magnetic fields , growth of perturbations under the reversed - shear conditions within the arm",
    "can be inhibited by coriolis forces ; these usually reduce the mass - collecting effect of self - gravity in a rotating system .",
    "however , magnetic tension forces from embedded field lines counteract coriolis forces , so that potential vorticity is no longer conserved and perturbations can grow rapidly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mji process works best when shear is weak .",
    "the spatially varying sense of shear inside a spiral arm ( reversed , then `` normal '' ) keeps the overall shear rate close to zero , therefore providing favorable conditions for the development of mji within the arm ( paper i ) .",
    "since the perturbations in model me2d1 initially have low amplitude , they remain in the linear regime through @xmath143 .",
    "it is not until @xmath144 , when perturbations have crossed the spiral arm twice ( since @xmath145 $ ] ) , that the most dominant mji mode emerges and shapes the condensed gas flowing into the interarm region into spur structures .",
    "figure [ mhd1pat]_a _ shows the surface density ( in logarithmic scale ) and velocity vectors at @xmath140 viewed from a frame corotating with the spiral arm .",

    "these spurs move in the @xmath58-direction with a speed @xmath147 relative to the spiral arm , implying that in the inertial frame they follow very closely the background galaxy rotation at the arm center .",
    "since the lower - resolution model me2d2 with @xmath148 zones also forms 4 spurs , while model me2d3 with @xmath149 zones results in 3 spurs ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) , we conclude that the number of spurs that form in our two - dimensional thick - disk models is independent of numerical resolution as long as the @xmath58-dimension of the simulation domain has 256 zones or more .",

    "note that the gas streamlines rather quickly converge to the spur wavefront as they move downstream from the spiral shock , indicating that spurs grow stronger by gathering material mainly along the @xmath58-direction ( parallel to the spiral arm ) .",

    "this result is consistent with @xcite , who found that self - gravitating substructures formed in turbulent mhd simulations are in general less supercritical than the parent system , presumably because fragmentation occurring along the flux tubes reduces the cloud mass while preserving magnetic flux ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "perturbations that are amplified ( via mji ) during a first passage through a spiral arm become preferentially trailing with high @xmath189 before they enter the next spiral shock ( see figure [ mhd1pat]_a _ ) .",
    "because of the strong compression immediately behind the shock , @xmath189 of these trailing wavelets is further increased before they enter the next stage of amplification by mji .",
    "consequently , the perturbations that eventually grow to emerge as spurs in model me2d1 have quite a large value of @xmath189 .    to quantify how finite disk thickness is expected to affect the development of mji inside spiral arms , we vary @xmath26 and search for @xmath191 and @xmath192 that give  based on linear theory  the maximum amplification magnitude @xmath193 for a given value of @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ amp_h ] plots the resulting @xmath194 and @xmath195 as solid lines as well as @xmath193 as a dotted line .",
    "the equilibrium surface - density profile of model me2d1 ( but with varying @xmath26 ) is again used .",
    "the linear theory suggests that the mji inside spiral arms in a disk with @xmath180 pc requires @xmath195 to be 2.6 times smaller than in a disk with @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding amplification magnitude @xmath193 is 2.3 times smaller for thick disks compared to thin disks . for comparison",
    ", we note that in the razor - thin models of paper i , spurs identified in simulations with @xmath114 typically have @xmath196 ( or @xmath197 ) , with larger @xmath183 ( or smaller @xmath129 ) corresponding to smaller-@xmath77 models .",
    "since the amplification factor is enormous when @xmath138 , the modes that come to dominate in razor - thin disks tend to be selected by compromise between maximum amplification and earliest growth ( paper i ) , and thus have @xmath183 larger than that corresponding to @xmath195 .    in the thick - disk models with their lower amplification ,",
    "on the other hand , early growth gives little advantage over other modes .",
    "model me2d1 therefore chooses the mode corresponding to the largest total amplification , whose wavelength turns out to be @xmath198 which is @xmath199 times larger ( in terms of @xmath200 ) than that found for razor - thin disk models in paper i. models with thick - disk gravity have peak surface densities twice as large as their razor - thin counterparts with the same @xmath82 and @xmath77 , which reduces the jeans length by about a factor of two .",
    "thus , for cloud mass scaling as @xmath201 , one can expect that bound clouds resulting from spur fragmentation in thick - disk gravity models should be @xmath202 times more massive than in razor - thin disks with the same @xmath82 and @xmath77 , or @xmath203 in dimensional units .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "we now turn to model ms2d1 ( and its lower - resolution counterparts ms2d2 - 3 ) , with @xmath109 , @xmath204 , and @xmath110 ( i.e. , @xmath205 ) , and unmagnetized model h2d1 ( with counterparts h2d2 - 3 ) having @xmath105 , @xmath204 , and @xmath106 . as figure [ evol2d ] shows , in models ms2d1 and h2d1 perturbations immediately begin to grow almost exponentially over time , while strong growth in model me2d1 does not begin until after two successive passages through spiral arms .",
    "the growth rates of the maximum surface density in models ms2d1 and h2d1 are almost identical , @xmath206 , suggesting that moderate magnetic fields are not important at least in the linear stages of growth in these simulations .",
    "the two models ms2d1 and h2d1 have similar evolution , but this is quite distinct from the behavior of equipartition - magnetization model me2d1 . unlike model me2d1 , in which the spiral shock remains relatively straight during the initial phase of mji growth , models ms2d1 and h2d1 show small - scale instability that wiggles the spiral shock front and forms structures with high vorticity .",
    "the left panel of figure [ mhd10_2d ] plots the surface density map in logarithmic gray - scale of model ms2d1 at @xmath207 .",
    "the dotted line marks the location of the spiral shock front , while the dashed line represents the position where shear in the background flow vanishes ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "evidently , the vortical clumps that emerge are closely connected to the shock discontinuity .",
    "column ( 9 ) in table [ tbl-1 ] shows that the hydrodynamic models h2d1 - 3 form more clumps than the weakly magnetized models ms2d1 - 3 , and that the number of vortical clumps produced depends rather sensitively on numerical resolution .    at @xmath209 , the growth of vortical structures in model ms2d1 saturates due to magnetic tension from bent field lines as well as nonlinear effects .",
    "( the flow properties inherent in the background spiral shock may also prevent the clumps from growing further . ) at this time , the clumps are not sufficiently self - gravitating to experience gravitational collapse due to their own weight .",
    "the clumps wander slightly inside the postshock regions and collide with each other to form bigger clumps . as figure [ mhd10_2d]@xmath210 shows , mergers of 10 low - density clumps at @xmath207 result in 5 high - density , gravitationally bound clumps at @xmath211 .",
    "these bound clumps have an average mass @xmath212 , a factor of 3 smaller than that originating from mji in model me2d1 , and are supercritical with an average mass - to - flux ratio @xmath213 .",
    "the interarm spur structures prominent in model me2d1 ( see fig .  [ mhd1pat ] ) are not clearly visible in models ms2d1 and h2d1 .    what causes the spiral shocks to wiggle and form vortical structures in models ms2d1 and h2d1 ?",
    "figure [ wiggle ] shows the temporal evolution of gas surface density and magnetic field lines in the rectangular section shown in the left frame of figure [ mhd10_2d ] .",

    "this suggests that the vortical clumps in model ms2d1 may arise from kelvin - helmholtz instability in the sheared flow ",
    "i.e. azimuthal streaming  associated with spiral shocks .",
    "@xcite performed non - self - gravitating global simulations of razor - thin , unmagnetized disks and found that when spiral perturbations are strong and have large pitch angles , the shock front that develops wiggles and forms discrete clumps bearing remarkable resemblance to those found in our models .",
    "wada and koda termed this process a `` wiggle instability '' .",
    "based on the low richardson numbers in the postshock regions , they argued that the formation of these clumps could be due to kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "as wada and koda noted , however , the richardson number criterion is only a _ necessary _",
    "condition for _ stability _",
    "@xcite , and should not be regarded as an instability criterion .",
    "the critical value of ri may , in addition , be affected by rotation . thus , while it is likely that the wiggle instability is indeed a manifestation of kelvin - helmholtz instability in the shear flows produced by spiral shocks , it is not yet certain .",
    "since models considered in @xcite are non - self - gravitating and unmagnetized , the wiggle instability , whether it is related to kelvin - helmholtz instability or not , relies neither upon magnetic fields nor self - gravity .",
    "paper i found that gas in razor - thin disks with @xmath214 is subject to either the mji or the swing amplifier , but is stable to the wiggle instability ; i.e. , non - self - gravitating models at these values of @xmath82 are expected to be stable .",
    "we have run a number of two - dimensional simulations of non - self - gravitating , unmagnetized disks with varying @xmath82 ( not listed in table [ tbl-1 ] ) , and found that the wiggle instability becomes manifest when @xmath215 .",
    "this suggests that spiral shocks must be fairly strong in order to trigger the wiggle instability for the parameters @xmath216 and @xmath217 in their model a ; the arm / interarm contrasts reached two orders of magnitude . ] .",
    "since non - self - gravitating gas behind a spiral shock is _ locally _ kelvin - helmholtz stable due to the expanding radial velocity inside the spiral arm @xcite , the wiggle instability is most likely a consequence of interaction between preshock gas and compressed postshock flows that stream at large relative velocity parallel to the shock front .",
    "it is also possible that spiral shocks are so strong that the postshock velocity perpendicular to the arm is vanishingly small , limiting the stabilization to kelvin - helmholtz modes . in any event",
    ", we do not believe the wiggle instability is likely to be important in spiral arms of real galaxies , because as we will show in the next section it does not occur in three - dimensional models , in which the fluid variables are not constant with height .",
    "to investigate the effects of disk stratification and other vertical variations on the formation of spiral - arm substructures , we have performed three sets of three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "the chosen parameters for the three - dimensional models listed in table [ tbl-2 ] are identical to those of the two - dimensional models presented in the previous section .",
    "we first set up an axisymmetric disk with equilibrium density distribution @xmath63 consistent with a chosen set of @xmath77 , @xmath83 , and @xmath68 .",
    "we then apply initial perturbations to the background density @xmath63 , using a spatially uncorrelated , gaussian random field that has flat power for @xmath218 and zero power for @xmath219 . for the amplitude of the perturbations , we fix the standard deviation of perturbed density in real space to be 3% of the initial midplane density .",
    "next , we slowly turn on a spiral potential perturbation ( the second term in eq .  [ [ ext_pot ] ] ) such that it acquires the full strength @xmath82 at @xmath220 .",
    "figure [ evol3d ] shows evolution of the maximum density in high - resolution three - dimensional models me3d1 , ms3d1 , and h3d1 . as the strength of the spiral potential increases , a density wave grows rapidly in the gas , until the initially - sinusoidal profile steepens into a shock . during this phase ,",
    "the growth of small - scale nonaxisymmetric perturbations is weak compared to the large - scale nonlinear response of the gas disk to the imposed spiral potential perturbation . at @xmath221 , slightly after the spiral potential attains its full strength , the spiral shock reaches its maximum strength , leaving density and velocity fields that fluctuate around the respective average configuration . at this stage ,",
    "the spiral shock still remains almost axisymmetric .",
    "paper i and  3 of the present paper showed that when vertical degrees of freedom are ignored , quasi - axisymmetric , steady - state profiles of gaseous spiral shocks can be readily obtained through time - dependent calculations in an external spiral potential ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that one - dimensional spiral shock profiles in the galactic midplane represent _ stable _ shock equilibria ( provided that gaseous self - gravity and external spiral forcing are not too strong ; see paper i ) .",
    "when we allow for vertical degrees of freedom in the fluid variables , however , we find that the profiles that develop are not in general quasi - steady . in the initial stages of all the three - dimensional models studied in this work , quasi - axisymmetric , two - dimensional spiral shocks develop in the @xmath57-@xmath43 plane ( hereafter xz spiral shocks ) that are in general non - stationary , swaying loosely back and forth in the direction perpendicular to the arm .    based on our simulation results , the `` flapping '' motions of xz spiral shocks are strongest at high altitudes , and stronger in model me3d1 than in models ms3d1 and h3d1 .",
    "we measure the maximum shock front excursion from its mean location as about 0.06@xmath130 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 at @xmath224 in models me3d1 , ms3d1 , and h3d1 , respectively .",
    "the non - steady nature of xz spiral shocks that we find is in fact commonly seen in other numerical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although @xcite constructed stationary shock profiles in a vertically extended disk , their models neglected the effects of the coriolis force , self - gravity , and magnetic fields .",
    "the flapping motions of xz spiral shocks may just be overshooting of gas caused by instantaneous force imbalance across the shock , or may represent a dynamical instability .",
    "detailed discussion on the physical origin of the spiral shock flapping , and the characteristics of the associated velocity and density fields , will be presented in a subsequent paper .    since spiral shocks in three dimensions exhibit temporal fluctuations , it is useful to take space - and - time averages in order to visualize the shock structures in the @xmath57-@xmath43 plane",

    "figure [ equil_xz]@xmath226 shows gas density in logarithmic scale and selected streamlines .",
    "the streamlines run almost parallel to the galactic midplane in the interarm region , but sharply plunge toward the midplane in the arm .",
    "the location of the averaged shock front is also indicated by a heavy line .",
    "the low vertical velocities of the gas in the interarm regions implies that vertical force balance is fairly well maintained there .",
    "as the material enters the spiral arm region , it is shocked and compressed .",
    "the increase of gas density due to the shock compression is largest at the midplane , which in turn produces strong vertical gravity and pulls high - altitude gas toward the midplane .",
    "the vertically - plunging gas further increases the midplane density after the shock , setting up repulsive pressure gradients that cause it to rebound back to high - altitude regions .",

    "although the surface density in model ms2d2 rises slightly more steeply at the shock than in model ms3d1 , they are overall in excellent agreement .",
    "this proves that the gravitational kernel given by equation ( [ kernel ] ) accurately handles the dilution of self - gravity in an extended disk .",
    "as figure [ equil_xz]_c _ shows , the gas within spiral arms is more compressed toward the midplane than in interarm regions .",
    "the tendency for gas to compress vertically in the arms increases as the magnetic field strength decreases .",
    "column ( 8) of table [ tbl-2 ] indicates that the ratio of arm to interarm scale heights is about 0.5 for models with @xmath106 or 10 , and 0.8 for @xmath114 models .",
    "this is because models with weaker magnetic fields have higher arm density enhancement , and thus relatively stronger self - gravity that vertically compresses spiral arm gas .",
    "we discuss the relationship of this finding to observations in  5.2 .",
    "finally , we remark that our models do not exhibit the `` hydraulic jump '' behavior that @xcite suggested may develop , under certain circumstances , at spiral shock fronts . while hydraulic jumps ( which yield an increase in the gas scale height where it is compressed in arms ) can occur when the equation of state is fairly stiff , @xcite note that when @xmath232 there are only shocks .",
    "magnetic fields parallel to the arm may provide extra stiffness , but self - gravity tends to draw gas toward the midplane in the post - shock region ; in our ( isothermal ) models this results in a decrease of @xmath233 within arms .",
    "it is not presently known whether the tendency of self - gravity to reduce @xmath233 would overcome the tendency of a sufficiently stiff equation of state to increase @xmath233 in arms , since the studies of @xcite did not include self - gravity .",
    "based on our two - dimensional thick - disk models , we found that perturbations in spiral shocks can grow , either as a result of the mji or the wiggle instability .",
    "one may naively expect that three - dimensional models would also be prone either to mji or to wiggle instability , not to mention to other potential three - dimensional instabilities . surprisingly , however , we find that the wiggle instability seen in some of our two - dimensional models is absent in three - dimensional models , while mji still operates in three - dimensional models",
    ". as we will show below , our three - dimensional model ms3d1 with @xmath110 is subject to mji , whereas the corresponding two - dimensional model ms2d2 ( with identical in - plane resolution to model ms3d1 ) was found to be unstable to the wiggle instability .",
    "in addition , the unmagnetized two - dimensional models h2d1-h2d3 developed vortical clumps via the wiggle instability that later merged and collapsed , but as figure [ evol3d ] shows , the corresponding three - dimensional model h3d1 does not develop strongly overdense clumps over the entire run .",
    "the peak density in model h3d1 fluctuates with period @xmath234 , comparable to the period associated with epicyclic motion , @xmath235 , within the arm peak .",
    "the wiggle instability seen in two - dimensional disks thus appears to be stabilized in three - dimensional disks , possibly due to a combination of strong vertical shear and non - steady flow .",
    "figure [ vshear ] shows the vertical distribution and gradients of the azimuthal- and time - averaged spiral shock velocities at @xmath236 ( upstream ) , 0.05 ( at the midplane density peak ) , and 0.22 ( far downstream ) , from model ms3d1 .",
    "the velocity shear along the vertical direction amounts to @xmath237 and @xmath238 at @xmath239 and @xmath240 at @xmath241 , where @xmath242 and where @xmath243 .",
    "these shear rates can be compared with @xmath30 , the radial shear rate in the background azimuthal flow , and with the maximum radial shear in the quasi - azimuthal flow within the arm , @xmath244 .",
    "perturbations in the spiral shock of model ms3d1 might try to develop nonaxisymmetric vortical flows similarly to those produced by the wiggle instability in two - dimensional thick - disk models",
    ". however , these vortical structures could not remain coherent in @xmath43 because of the strong vertical shear in horizontal velocities ; vertical motions would then mix dissimilar vorticity , so that the vortices would be lose their integrity .",
    "in addition , non - steady flapping of the shock front would also help prevent coherent structures from forming .",
    "overall , the various three - dimensional effects combine to suppress nonlinear development of the wiggle instability .    since our three - dimensional models explore cases with @xmath245 , our results are not directly comparable to cases in which spiral shocks are as strong as in @xcite s models .",
    "strong spiral shocks in two dimensions are more favorable for promoting wiggle instability , but in three dimensions they would also result in stronger shock flapping motions and stronger vertical shear of the in - plane velocities , which tend to suppress the wiggle instability .",
    "thus , it would require direct three - dimensional simulations with very large @xmath82 to determine whether increasing shock strength overall stabilizes or destabilizes spiral shocks to `` wiggle '' modes .",
    "however , we consider this question of limited practical importance , since real astronomical systems would in general become self - gravitating if very strong shocks were present . in this sense ,",
    "the non - self - gravitating treatment of @xcite , with @xmath246 , appears unrealistic given that the spiral shocks in their models have density jumps of a factor 100 .",
    "contrasts in real galaxies are far smaller ; e.g. the notoriously strong spiral structure in m51 has arm / interarm contrasts of 5 - 6 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is because equilibrium shock profiles are only possible at moderate values of @xmath82 ( paper i ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath105 and @xmath247 , quasi - axisymmetric shock equilibria with thick - disk gravity exist only if @xmath248 , beyond which shock profiles are highly transient or suffer from immediate quasi - axisymmetric gravitational instability ( see section 4.2.4 )",
    ".      when shear is strong ( with @xmath249 ) and magnetic fields are absent , nonaxisymmetric modes are not subject to mji but can grow via swing amplification @xcite .",
    "the growth of wave amplitudes via swing amplification is moderate unless the @xmath77 value of the background medium is sufficiently small .",
    "@xcite showed that swing amplification in a razor - thin , featureless disk with @xmath250 yields low density fluctuations and can not form gravitationally bound clumps .",
    "paper i further found that the swing amplifier produces substructure growth in spiral arms only if the background spiral perturbation is relatively weak ( with @xmath251 in a razor - thin disk ) . in this case , the density enhancement in the shock is quite low and all the gas has normal shear , as opposed to the locally - reversed shear which occurs wherever @xmath252 .    with @xmath204 ,",
    "model h3d1 in the present work has strong shear reversal corresponding to @xmath253 inside a spiral arm .",
    "in addition , a relatively large value of @xmath105 as well vertically - diluted self - gravity make swing amplification in model h3d1 quite ineffective . the resulting nonaxisymmetric structures in the surface density of model h3d1 at the end of the run ( @xmath254 ) have the maximum power in the @xmath255 mode , which is only @xmath256 relative to the axisymmetric mode ; the associated maximum surface density is 1.46 times the mean surface density .",
    "we thus conclude that the swing amplification mechanism is unlikely to prompt the formation of substructure within spiral arms in real disk galaxies where spiral arms are not so weak . of course , as the models of paper i showed , even without magnetic fields , if @xmath77 is small enough , and/or if @xmath82 is large enough , spiral arms can become unstable to fragmentation .",
    "this fragmentation in general _ first _ develops via quasi - axisymmetric instability , so the process is physically distinct from direct swing amplification .",
    "we will discuss this alternative fragmentation process in  [ axiu ] .",
    "in the preceding subsections , we have shown that the wiggle instability disappears in three - dimensional extended disk models , and that swing amplification is only moderate in unmagnetized , three - dimensional disks that have sizable spiral arm density contrasts but nevertheless are stable to quasi - axisymmetric self - gravitating perturbations .",
    "when a system is magnetized and has weak net shear , however , it is expected that perturbations should be able to grow via mji .",
    "figure [ evol3d ] shows that the density in our magnetized models me3d1 and ms3d1 indeed undergoes exponential growth , with the simulations eventually producing gravitationally bound condensations . as we will discuss below , typical wavelengths of the most unstable modes in models me3d1 and ms3d1 are very similar to that of the mji in two - dimensional , thick disks ; these wavelengths are much larger than those of the wiggle instability in two - dimensional models ( see tables [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] ) indicates , the separation of spurs in our three - dimensional models depends on the numerical resolution .",

    "in addition , spur morphologies and the physical properties of bound clouds that form from fragmentation of the spurs in three - dimensional models are similar to those due to mji in two - dimensional thick - disk models .",
    "this supports the case that structure forms in our three - dimensional models as a result of mji . since gravity is a long - range force and insensitive to density structure at small scales , mji ( unlike the wiggle instability )",
    "can grow in spite of the unsteady flows of the background xz spiral shock .",
    "the vertical velocity shear and flapping may delay the onset of bound cloud formation to some extent , but it is mji that drives three - dimensional systems with magnetic fields into eventual runaway .    as in two - dimensional models ,",

    "these results are remarkably close to that found in two - dimensional model me2d1 in  3.1 and those resulting from mji ( paper ii ) or via swing amplification ( paper iii ) in three - dimensional disks without spiral features .    because of efficient magnetic torques exerted by field lines linking a cloud with the surrounding medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) , bound clouds in models ms3d1 and me3d1 lose a substantial amount of angular momentum and thus rotate relatively slowly .",

    "similar specific angular momenta of clouds have been obtained in our other three - dimensional magnetized simulations ( paper ii , paper iii ) , where we also showed that condensations in unmagnetized models do not lose angular momentum as they evolve , while those in magnetized models do .    finally",
    ", we remark on the effects of @xcite instability on the formation of spiral - arm substructure in our three - dimensional models .",
    "the spiral potential compresses the density and magnetic fields , decreasing the average @xmath288 value inside the spiral shock from 10 to 2.5 for model ms3d1 and from 1 to 0.4 for model me3d1 . taking @xmath289 and the radial wavelength @xmath290 equal to the arm width , and neglecting the effect of cosmic ray pressure , the local dispersion relation of the parker instability in a rotating disk presented by @xcite yields @xmath291 for the most unstable parker mode ( this is insensitive to the specific choices of @xmath288 and @xmath290 ) .",
    "the corresponding wavelength is @xmath292 kpc @xmath293 .",
    "this agrees with the separations identified for spurs in models ms3d1 and me3d1 .",
    "however , because this wavelength also coincides with the scale predicted to have the largest growth from mji ( see  3.1 and fig .",
    "[ linear ] ) , it is not immediately obvious whether parker instability is important in prompting this growth .    to investigate this further ,",
    "we have examined the detailed distributions of magnetic fields and velocities during the period when overdense condensations begin to emerge within the arms .",
    "figure [ parker ] shows in logarithmic color scale the density in a yz slice at @xmath294 , overlaid with a vector field of perturbed velocity ( relative to the mean value in the slice ) , and magnetic field lines .",
    "evidently , there is no sign of the characteristic correlation of magnetic valleys / hills with overdense / underdense regions that parker modes would produce , nor is there any sign of sinusoidal variations in the vertical velocities with azimuth . in part",
    ", the ability of parker modes to grow may be suppressed by the strong vertical gradients in @xmath295 and @xmath54 ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ parker ] and also fig .",
    "[ vshear ] ) . given the curved nature of the spiral shock front in the xz plane , high - altitude regions can have large horizontal velocities with respect to the midplane gas below them , such that magnetic fields that begin to buckle vertically can not maintain the shape required for parker modes to develop .",
    "thus , we conclude that magnetic buoyancy effects are probably not of major importance in gmc formation within spiral arms . even without the suppression of parker modes by vertical shear that we see here",
    ", previous work has shown that parker instability _ alone _",
    "is unable to form high - density clouds in regions away from arms ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper ii ) , a consequence of it being a self - limiting process stabilized by tension forces from bent field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while parker instability may help seed structure in early stages of gravitational instabilities , and may be essential in removing excess magnetic flux from the disk , it does not appear crucial for massive cloud formation and subsequent star formation .",
    "we briefly discuss evolution of unmagnetized model hu3d1 , with @xmath109 , @xmath204 , and @xmath106 . in this model",
    ", @xmath77 is small enough to induce quasi - axisymmetric gravitational instability of a spiral shock .",
    "as figure [ evol3d ] shows , the maximum density in model hu3d1 at @xmath220 is larger by a factor of 3 than that in stable model h3d1 with @xmath105 . soon after the spiral perturbation attains its full strength ,",
    "the system is dominated by the exponential growth of quasi - axisymmetric modes in the spiral shock . at around @xmath296 ,",
    "the collapsing post - shock layer reaches sufficient density that it begins to undergo non - axisymmetric gravitational fragmentation .",
    "this results in the formation of 13 bound condensations aligned along the shock front , with mass @xmath212 each .",
    "note that while magnetized models ms3d1 and me3d1 first develop spur structures that subsequently fragment into bound clouds in both arm and interarm regions , the bound clouds in unmagnetized model hu3d1 do not require prior formation of spurs .",
    "these clouds form directly in the highest - density ridge of the spiral shock .",
    "the spacing of bound clouds in model hu3d1 is @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the jeans length in the initial featureless disk .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath299 for the spur separation in magnetized model ms3d1 with the same @xmath77 and @xmath82 parameters as model hu3d1 ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "( which is undefined ) .",
    "] this demonstrates that the presence of magnetic fields makes significant differences in the dynamical evolution of gas in spiral arms .",
    "a key unsolved problem in the dynamics and evolution of spiral galaxies lies in understanding the origin of spiral - arm substructure , including gaseous spurs , giant molecular clouds , and complexes of giant regions .",
    "various observational and theoretical arguments increasingly support the notion that this arm substructure may originate from gravitational instability of diffuse gas within spiral arms . in paper",
    "i , we studied dynamical evolution of a local segment of a magnetized spiral arm in a razor - thin model of a disk .",
    "we showed that magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) initiated within spiral arms naturally yields gaseous spurs extending into the interarm region .",
    "paper i further showed that these spurs fragment into bound condensations that could potentially evolve into arm and interarm regions .",
    "the thin - disk models of paper i , however , tend to overestimate midplane self - gravity , which favors small - scale mji modes .",
    "the models of paper i were also unable to capture potential dynamical consequences of the parker instability and other three - dimensional instabilities that rely critically upon the vertical dimension . here , we have extended paper i to consider these important effects .",
    "we consider two sets of numerical models : two - dimensional disks in which a thick - disk gravitational kernel ( eq .  [ [ kernel ] ] ) approximately treats the geometric dilution of self - gravity , and full three - dimensional disks in which all fluid variables are allowed to vary with the vertical coordinate . as in paper",
    "i , both models adopt an isothermal equation of state .",
    "our main objectives were to explore how the properties of spurs and bound condensations produced by mji in vertically - extended disks differ from the models of paper i , and to examine the effectiveness of three - dimensional dynamical instabilities other than mji in forming spiral - arm substructures .",
    "the following summarizes the main results of the present work :    \\1 . in our new models with sufficiently - magnetized conditions ,",
    "spiral shocks give rise to gaseous spurs and bound clouds in a manner similar to the models of paper i. this is true either for two - dimensional `` thick disk '' or three - dimensional models .",
    "the spur structures themselves are slightly more trailing than those in razor - thin disks .",
    "dilution of self - gravity due to finite disk thickness is significant , causing the typical separation of spurs @xmath129 ( along the arm ) to be about 10 times the jeans length @xmath300 at the spiral arm peak , which is 3  5 times larger than the prediction of @xmath200 from thin - disk models .",
    "the agreement between three - dimensional and two - dimensional `` thick disk '' models implies that , in this strong-@xmath301-field case , the mechanism behind spur and clump formation is the mji .",
    "reduced gravity in thick disks also causes the bound condensations that form when spurs fragment to be more massive than in thin - disk models .",
    "the average mass of these clouds is @xmath302 corresponding to 6  12 times the thin - disk jeans mass at the arm peak , and comparable to the thick - disk jeans mass at the arm peak .",
    "the clump masses are comparable to the thin - disk jeans mass at the mean unperturbed surface density of the disk .",
    "these bound clouds are magnetically supercritical with the mean mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath303 , and undergo significant loss of angular momentum ( @xmath304 of the initial galactic value ) via magnetic braking .",
    "before gravitational instability sets in , our three - dimensional models exhibit time - dependent behavior in their spiral shock structure that is quite unlike the rapid approach to steady state that characterizes two - dimensional models .",
    "the three - dimensional distributions can be averaged over the @xmath58 direction ( parallel to the spiral arm ) to yield an xz shock profile . in these xz profiles ,",
    "the shock front generally moves back and forth relative to its mean position ( in quasi - radial coordinate @xmath57 ) .",
    "the flapping period of the xz spiral shock in an unmagnetized model is @xmath305 , comparable to the epicyclic period at the arm peak .",
    "the amplitude of the flapping motion tends to be larger at large @xmath43 in a given model , with radial excursions of @xmath306 at @xmath307 in the @xmath114 model .",
    "this amplitude is a factor 3 or 2 times larger than in models with @xmath110 or unmagnetized ( @xmath106 ) models , respectively .",
    "this flapping and other nonsteady motions do not seem to strongly affect development of gravitational instabilities , however , probably because they depend on a mean density enhancement over large scales that need not be strictly coherent for growth .",
    "it is informative to consider the time average of the xz shock profiles .",
    "the shock front in this mean profile is in general curved in the @xmath57-@xmath43 plane . in these xz profiles ,",
    "spiral arm regions are generally thinner than interarm regions ; the ratio of scale heights in arm to interarm regions is about 0.5 for models with @xmath110 or @xmath308 and @xmath309 for @xmath114 models .",
    "the surface density distributions of the time - averaged profiles are similar to those of one - dimensional steady spiral shocks resulting from two - dimensional thick - disk - gravity models averaged over @xmath58 .",
    "this suggests that the thick - disk gravitational kernel of equation ( [ kernel ] ) provides a good approximation for the gravitational potential near the midplane of a three - dimensional disk .",
    "it also shows why , due to the right _ average _ conditions , gravitational instabilities grow , despite significant stochasticity in the flow .",
    "we find that weakly magnetized or unmagnetized two - dimensional models are unstable to the `` wiggle instability '' described by @xcite ( based on non - self - gravitating models with strong shocks ) .",
    "@xcite advocated kelvin - helmholtz instabilities as an explanation for the wiggle instability , and argued that spiral arm spurs could arise from this mechanism .",
    "indeed , we find the magnetic field topology and the generation of vorticity near the shock front in our two - dimensional unmagnetized or weakly magnetized models are suggestive of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in shear layers .",
    "we also find that mergers of vortical clumps in these two - dimensional models can eventually produce self - gravitating clouds with mass @xmath310 , although the spur structures are much less prominent than in our two - dimensional models with stronger magnetic fields .",
    "most importantly , however , we find that the vorticity - generating wiggle instability is absent in full three - dimensional models of all magnetic field strengths .",
    "it appears that radial flapping motions of the xz shock front , combined with strong vertical shear of horizontal velocities , quickly disrupt any coherent vortical structures that would otherwise grow .",
    "we therefore conclude that the wiggle instability is an artifact of two - dimensional models within a certain parameter range , and is unlikely to play an important role in forming spiral - arm substructures in real spiral galaxies .    \\5 .",
    "while the parker instability has long been invoked as a primary mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds inside spiral arms , our three - dimensional models do not show any noticeable evidence of developing parker modes .",
    "there is no indication of sinusoidal vertical velocities , or correlation of magnetic hills / valleys with over / under dense regions . like the wiggle instability",
    ", the parker instability appears to be suppressed by strong vertical shear of inplane velocities .",
    "in addition to mji , two other mechanisms capable of forming gravitationally bound clouds in disk galaxies are swing amplification and collapse of spiral arms parallel to the shock front ( followed by fragmentation ) .",
    "the simulation outcomes of our unmagnetized , three - dimensional models with spiral arms show , however , that the growth of nonaxisymmetric disturbances via swing amplification is very small when @xmath204 and @xmath105 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of paper i , in which we showed that swing amplification in thin disks is efficient only if the background spiral perturbation does not exceed 1% . with reduced self - gravity ,",
    "swing amplification in three - dimensional spiral arms becomes even more inefficient .",
    "thus , the swing mechanism would appear to apply either in interarm regions or in galaxies without strong spiral arms .",
    "on the other hand , our unmagnetized model with @xmath204 and @xmath109 was sufficiently unstable that quasi - axisymmetric growth developed as soon as the external potential reached full strength .",
    "fragmentation into closely - spaced bound clouds then occurred .",
    "conceivably , this kind of cloud formation process could be important in galaxies that are intrinsically quite close to instability , and experience a tidal encounter that tips them `` over the edge '' .",
    "the summary above makes clear that our new three - dimensional models uphold the principal conclusions of paper i  namely , that gravitational instability in the gas component of spiral arms ( 1 ) is able to form bound clouds with properties similar to the most massive gmcs , and ( 2 ) can lead to the development of interarm extensions similar to features that have been described in the observational literature as spiral arm spurs and feathers .",
    "our models show that gaseous spurs may continue to stand out against the interarm background for a long time after clouds form , without being dispersed ( see figures [ colb10 ] and [ colb1 ] ) .",
    "since interarm regions are characterized by low gas density and strong shear , they are normally thought of as being hostile for gas to condense gravitationally .",
    "our model simulations predict , however , that even interarm regions with low _ mean _ gas density can be abundant with kpc- and larger - scale substructure , arranged in trailing gaseous spurs that may host regions . the material that makes up these interarm spurs consists of parcels of gas that were the center of attraction during the most recent spiral arm transit",
    "the concentration of interarm gas into secondary spurs may be crucial in enabling clouds , and hence stars and regions , to form at large distances from the gas - dust ridges that mark the primary loci of spiral arms .",
    "because of this , azimuthal offsets between primary dust lanes and maxima in h@xmath311 emission may not give meaningful measures of star formation `` lag '' timescales ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "while the bound clouds produced in our models continue collapsing in a runaway fashion , our numerical resolution is inadequate to follow their evolution beyond the point where the central cloud density has grown by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is because the local jeans length must be resolved with at least a few spatial zones for accurate evolution ; unphysical fragmentation may otherwise occur @xcite .",
    "although the future of the massive , bound clouds we identify can not be known at this point , we speculate that their internal turbulent dynamics ( unresolved in the present models ) would lead to fragmentation into gmcs , some portions of which would undergo clustered star formation .",
    "the eventual result would be giant regions in both spiral arm and interarm regions .",
    "the masses , magnetic fluxes , and angular momenta of the clouds formed via gravitational instability in the present three - dimensional models are quite similar to the results of papers ii and iii , in spite of differences in the specific mechanisms involved in each case . in paper ii",
    ", there was no spiral structure present , while in paper iii there was strong turbulence associated with the magnetorotational instability .",
    "thus , we conclude that it would be difficult to discern the detailed route to cloud formation by observing the end result ; not enough information is retained . on the other hand , the similarity of these bulk cloud properties from models with rather different particulars indicates a robustness of conclusions for the outcome of self - gravitating cloud formation in all kinds of disk galaxies .",
    "our finding that gas in spiral arms is thinner than in interarm regions appears to be consistent with @xcite who reported that the scale height of the layer in our galaxy systematically decreases with increasing midplane density .",
    "the fact that the milky way molecular gas , which predominantly traces spiral arms , has about half the scale height of gas @xcite also supports our result .",
    "@xcite furthermore find that massive co gmcs , which are preferentially associated with spiral arms in the milky way @xcite , have a smaller scale height than low - mass molecular clouds .",
    "we note however that more quantitative comparison would require consideration of ism turbulence and other processes that may vary spatially , and significantly affect the gas scale height .    in the present models",
    ", we find that 20 - 30% of the total gas has collected into massive bound clumps by the end of the simulation , in those cases where gravitational instability occurs .",
    "we have found similar , or slightly smaller fractions in the uniform - shear ( @xmath30 ) three - dimensional models of paper ii and iii ( the range is @xmath312 ) .",
    "this fraction can be thought of as the efficiency , per gmc formation timescale , of converting diffuse gas to gas capable of forming stars . in the present models ,",
    "the timescale for gravitational instability to run away is 2 - 6 orbits , for a range of values of @xmath77 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "combining these raw numbers would imply an effective gmc formation timescale from diffuse gas of @xmath313 .",
    "however , we believe that in fact this somewhat overestimates the true timescale for the average parcel of diffuse gas to be incorporated in a bound cloud . while the conversion efficiency per gmc formation timescale may be realistic , the time to reach runaway is probably longer than it would be in a real system , because our initial perturbation amplitudes are likely low compared to realistic values . an important direction for future study will be to measure cloud formation rates in simulations where cloud destruction is also incorporated",
    "; we plan to pursue studies of this kind .",
    "models of this kind will provide more realistic background conditions from which gravitational instabilities can develop .",
    "while the real ism has a multi - phase structure due to the particular heating and cooling processes that are relevant , we have adopted a much simpler isothermal approximation throughout this paper .",
    "the inclusion of gaseous cooling that leads to dense cloud formation at small spatial scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) might indirectly affect formation timescales , mean separations , and masses of the gmcs and other structures that result from self - gravitating instabilities in spiral arms .",
    "it is often assumed that the total velocity dispersion in the warm / cold medium can be treated as an effective sound speed ; whether this treatment is adequate will be addressed directly in future work .",
    "our three - dimensional isothermal simulations show that the wiggle instability is stabilized by strong vertical shear and non - steady flows associated with spiral shocks , but the situation could conceivably be different if thermal instability and multi - phase gas structure are considered .",
    "this outstanding issue will direct our future research as well .",
    "finally , we remark that , while spiral structure clearly can help gravitational instability and prompt star formation , it may also contribute to limiting these processes .",
    "as we have discussed , spiral shocks ( especially when strongly magnetized ) , lead to time dependent motions that may be important in feeding turbulence at scales @xmath314 .",
    "the present models are isothermal at @xmath315k , so the sound speed @xmath316 exceeds turbulent velocity amplitudes .",
    "however , in the real ism there is significant cold gas for which the random turbulent motions far exceed the sound speed @xmath317 .",
    "the turbulence in the cold ism component may be key to regulating self - gravitating instabilities . in a future publication",
    ", we will discuss results of an investigation focusing on the details of turbulent driving by spiral shocks .",

    "<S> we investigate the growth of spiral - arm substructure in vertically stratified , self - gravitating , galactic gas disks , using local numerical mhd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our new models extend our previous two - dimensional studies @xcite , which showed that a magnetized spiral shock in a thin disk can undergo magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) , resulting in regularly - spaced interarm spur structures and massive gravitationally - bound fragments . </S>",
    "<S> similar spur ( or `` feather '' ) features have recently been seen in high - resolution observations of several galaxies , and massive bound gas condensations are likely the precursors of giant molecular cloud complexes ( gmcs ) and regions . here , we consider two sets of numerical models : two - dimensional simulations that use a `` thick - disk '' gravitational kernel , and three - dimensional simulations with explicit vertical stratification . </S>",
    "<S> both models adopt an isothermal equation of state with @xmath0 . when disks are sufficiently magnetized and self - gravitating , the result in both sorts of models is the growth of spiral - arm substructure similar to that in our previous razor - thin models . </S>",
    "<S> reduced self - gravity due to nonzero disk thickness increases the spur spacing to @xmath1 times the jeans length at the arm peak , a factor @xmath2 times larger than in razor - thin models . </S>",
    "<S> bound clouds that form from spur fragmentation have masses @xmath3 each , a factor @xmath4 times larger than in razor - thin models with the same gas surface density and stellar spiral arm strength . </S>",
    "<S> these condensation masses are comparable to results from other three - dimensional models without spiral structure , and similar to the largest observed gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - to - flux ratios and specific angular momenta of the bound condensations are lower than large - scale galactic values , as is true for observed gmcs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that unmagnetized or weakly magnetized two - dimensional models are unstable to the `` wiggle instability '' previously identified by @xcite , and proposed as a potential spur- and clump - forming mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however , our fully three - dimensional models do not show this effect . </S>",
    "<S> non - steady motions and strong vertical shear prevent coherent vortical structures from forming , evidently suppressing the wiggle instability that appears in two - dimensional ( isothermal ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find no clear traces of parker instability in the nonlinear spiral arm substructures that emerge ( in self - gravitating models ) , although conceivably parker modes may help seed the mji at early stages since azimuthal wavelengths are similar . </S>"
