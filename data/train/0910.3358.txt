    "einstein gravity in higher dimensions admits unexpected rich structures due to the lack of uniqueness theorems . this fact has aided a lot for making a number of significant discoveries since ten years ago and henceforth , including the braneworld scenarios , novel types of black holes / rings / strings / branes etc .",
    "usually , the richness of higher dimensional gravity is manifested through the appearance of exotic black objects which are absent in 4 dimensions ( for recent reviews , see @xcite and references therein ) or through some novel compactification mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , even on the level of empty spacetime without any black object living inside such richness already signify itself . in this paper",
    "we shall describe an exact vacuum solution of einstein gravity with a cosmological constant in 5 dimensions .",
    "this solution does not contain any black hole in it , but the appearance of two acceleration horizons makes its global structure highly nontrivial .",
    "the metric to be studied will be presented in a c - metric like coordinate system .",
    "the c - metric is a 4 dimensional axial symmetric spacetime with two black holes accelerating apart .",
    "it is known since quite a long time ago @xcite , has found significant applications in constructing black ring solutions in 5 dimensions in the recent years @xcite , and admits very interesting physical features @xcite . in the light of the on - going intensive studies on higher dimensional gravities ,",
    "it is a bit strange that no higher dimensional analogues of the c - metric has been found so far .",
    "it becomes clear only recently @xcite that a higher dimensional analogue of the c - metric admitting black hole horizons does not exist at all .",
    "therefore the best one can do in generalizing the c - metric to higher dimensions is to construct analogues of empty ( i.e. all charges vanishing ) c - metric spacetime in higher dimensions .",
    "the metric presented in this paper can be regarded as a preliminary result in this direction . though the lack of black hole horizons makes the metric sound less interesting , the inclusion of a cosmological constant heals a bit to encode the metric with richer structures .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the cosmological constant is considered to be non - negative . for negative cosmological constant , the metric is still an exact solution to the vacuum einstein equation but the global structure will be different , and hence we shall not consider it here but leave it to a separate study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall present the metric to be studied with emphasis on the physically allowed ranges of the coordinate system .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the studies of the horizon geometry .",
    "then , in section 4 , we describe the global structure of the spacetime through the introduction of a number of coordinate transformations and by depicting the penrose diagrams . in section 5",
    "we give a quick 4 dimensional interpretation of the metric via kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction .",
    "the reduced metric corresponds to a 4 dimensional gravity coupled to a 4d liouville field and possibly a maxwell field .",
    "section 6 studies the particular limit of @xmath2 , i.e. vanishing cosmological constant . in this limit",
    "the spacetime admits an interesting exterior geometric description .",
    "the paper is ended in section 7 with some concluding remarks .",
    "the metric we shall be studying in this article has the form @xmath3 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 this is an exact solution to the 5-dimensional vacuum einstein equation @xmath5 with cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath7 are intentionally taken such that the metric resembles very much to the famous c - metric in 4 dimensions .    to interpret the metric as a physically acceptable spacetime we need to impose some constraint conditions over the ranges of coordinates .",
    "while doing so we kept the following principles in mind , i.e. 1 ) the spacetime must involve only one timelike direction and 2 ) there should be a region in the spacetime in which the metric becomes static .",
    "the existence of a static region is in fact not a physical requirement but a choice for convenience , which is enjoyed very much in the studies of usual de sitter spacetime as well as 4-dimensional c - metric spacetime , so we impose it .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) has two explicit killing coordinates : @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "either of these can play the role of a timelike coordinate ( possibly after wick rotation ) . for the moment we choose @xmath1 as timelike and leave @xmath0 as an angular coordinate .",
    "looking back on the metric ( [ metric ] ) , one can see that the overall conformal factor @xmath8 implies that the points satisfying @xmath9 form the conformal infinity .",
    "therefore , the spacetime must lie on one side of @xmath10 , i.e. we need to choose either @xmath11 or @xmath12 . without loss of generality",
    ", we make the first choice : @xmath11 .",
    "each one of the functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 has two zeros @xmath16 where @xmath17 for @xmath18 we have @xmath19 where the equalities hold only for @xmath2 .",
    "the requirement that only one timelike coordinate is present in the metric ( 1 ) implies that both @xmath13 and @xmath14 must always be non - negative .",
    "the requirement @xmath20 implies that @xmath21 must take values from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "this result , together with the requirements @xmath25 and @xmath26 , implies that @xmath27 must take values in @xmath28 , and the other root @xmath29 of the function @xmath14 is beyond the physical region of the coordinates . notice that for @xmath30 , there is a chance for the inequality @xmath26 to saturate , implying that the conformal infinity can be part of the spacetime ; for @xmath31 , @xmath27 will always be bigger than 1 and hence it is impossible to saturate the inequality @xmath26 , so the conformal infinity is well beyond the physical region of the spacetime .",
    "in other words , the spacial sections of the @xmath32 spacetime at a fixed time must have finite volume , just like the usual maximally symmetric de sitter spacetime .",
    "since @xmath33 $ ] , we can make a change of variable @xmath34 so that @xmath35 takes values in @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "then the metric ( [ metric ] ) becomes @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the geometry of the @xmath38 directions is conformally equivalent to a 2-sphere .",
    "this helps in determining the physical range for the coordinate @xmath0 , which is taken as @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath1 is timelike then @xmath15 must be positive , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath15 is negative then @xmath41 will be timelike and we have either @xmath42 or @xmath43 . when @xmath44 , the metric ( [ metric ] ) is static .",
    "otherwise it is non - static .",
    "the points @xmath45 are coordinate singularities of ( [ metric ] ) , which are causal boundaries between different spacetime regions ( horizons ) . these horizons are not related to black holes ",
    "they are only acceleration horizons , because all the curvature invariants are completely regular over the whole spacetime .",
    "for instance , the curvature scalar formed by contracting two riemann tensors reads @xmath46 which is everywhere regular .    to summarize , the coordinate ranges of our spacetime are given as follows : @xmath47 , \\\\",
    "\\phi & \\in [ 0 , 2 \\pi ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     slice of the physical region of the spacetime : the static patch of the spacetime is the region bounded by the planes @xmath48",

    "the @xmath21 axis stretches from left to right , the @xmath27 axis extends bottom up , and the @xmath41 axis is transverse to the paper and extends from behind to the front of the paper sheet .",
    "the coordinate @xmath0 is completely omitted and hence every point in the figure should be understood as a circle along @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath54 coordinates of the twelve marked points are @xmath55 the plane @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath9 , i.e. the conformal infinity .",
    "the plane marked with @xmath48 obeys @xmath57 , and the physical region of the spacetime is above this plane .",
    "clearly the figure corresponds to the case @xmath58 . for @xmath2 , the lines @xmath59 and @xmath60 will overlap each other . the planes @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively correspond to @xmath63 , the maximal and minimal allowed values for @xmath21 ,",
    "so the physical region is in between these two planes .",
    "the planar region @xmath51 ( with @xmath64 ) is one of the acceleration horizons .",
    "the other horizon @xmath65 is the planar region @xmath52 .",
    "the static patch of the spacetime is the region bounded by the planes @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "crossing the horizons the spacetime has two dynamic patches , namely the region in front of the plane @xmath66 and bounded by the planes @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the region behind the plane @xmath52 and bounded by the planes @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "let us now consider the geometry of the horizons at @xmath45 .",
    "the line element on ( each of ) the horizon reads @xmath67 .",

    "is only half of the usual @xmath78-sphere .",
    "this is because of the appearance of @xmath79 in the conformal factor . ]",
    "what remains to ask is the area of the horizon . to calculate this , we just need to calculate the square root of the determinant of the horizon metric and integrate the result over the permitted range of coordinates on the horizon .",
    "the square root of the determinant of the horizon metric ( [ horizon ] ) reads @xmath80 therefore , integrating over the whole horizon , we get the area of ( each of ) the horizon @xmath81 which is a finite number for @xmath82 and is divergent for @xmath83 .",
    "remembering the fact that @xmath84 , we get @xmath85 this area is equal to that of a 3-sphere of radius @xmath86 .",
    "as @xmath87 , this effective radius goes to infinity and that is why the horizon area diverges for @xmath2 .",
    "since there is no black hole living inside the spacetime , we can only interpret the horizons as acceleration horizons or rindler horizons .",
    "this can be justified by introducing the rindler coordinate @xmath88 in the static region @xmath89 so that the near horizon line element in the @xmath90 plane is changed into @xmath91 notice that the coordinate singularity at the horizons @xmath45 are now transformed into @xmath92 . to study",
    "the nature of the horizons we must introduce kruskal like coordinates which is nonsingular on the horizons .",
    "this is achieved via the coordinate transformations @xmath93 in terms of which the rindler line element becomes @xmath94 remember that the coordinates @xmath95 does not cover the whole spacetime but only the static region .",
    "now consider the proper acceleration of a particle with a timelike trajectory @xmath96 along the killing vector field @xmath97 . in the coordinates @xmath95 , the killing vector @xmath98 can be rewritten as @xmath99 and it is easy to see that the horizons at @xmath100 and @xmath101 are normal to this killing vector , i.e. they are killing horizons with respect to @xmath98 .",
    "the proper velocity reads @xmath102 so , the corresponding proper acceleration is @xmath103 finally , the amplitude of the proper acceleration is @xmath104 we see that @xmath105 diverges on the horizons justifying the statement that they are acceleration horizons .",
    "to fully characterize the spacetime , it is necessary to identify the global structure thereof . to achieve this ,",
    "let us look at the light rays in the @xmath90 plane , which are characterized by the condition @xmath106 i.e. @xmath107 integrating the above relation and name the result on the right hand side @xmath108 , we get @xmath109 in terms of which the light rays are expressed as @xmath110 lightlike variables in the new ( tortoise ) coordinate are given by @xmath111 the metric on the @xmath90 plane is now written as to denote the `` radial '' line element in the @xmath90 plane in order to distinguish from the complete line element @xmath112 . ]",
    "@xmath113 the horizons at @xmath45 are now located at @xmath114 in terms of the tortoise coordinate .",
    "thus the static patch of the spacetime is infinitely large and we can not describe the region of the spacetime beyond the horizons using @xmath108 .",
    "the way out is simple , though . in order to analyze the global structure of the spacetime",
    ", we first need to make some conformal map of the coordinates such that at the horizons the value of the new coordinates are finite and the metric in the new coordinates is nonsingular",
    ". then we can analytically extend across the horizons to get an effective description of the regions inside the horizons . to proceed , however , we need to observe that the nonsingular coordinates can not be defined identically from one horizon to the other .",
    "so we need to define nonsingular coordinates separately near each horizon .",
    "let us start from the static patch and consider the nonsingular coordinates near the horizon @xmath65 ( or @xmath115 ) . by the words",
    "`` near the horizon at @xmath65 '' we mean that we are considering part of the spacetime in the static patch for which @xmath116 .",
    "we introduce @xmath117 such that the region outside the horizon obeys @xmath118 , @xmath119 the radial line element in this particular part of the spacetime reads @xmath120 in which we have made use of the definition of the function @xmath15 . introducing new coordinates @xmath121 with relations @xmath122 the line element",
    "is turned into @xmath123 it is easy to see that @xmath124 so the horizon @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath125 , two straight lines in the @xmath126 coordinates . the last relation also implicitly defines @xmath41 , from which one sees that there is no singularity encountered while passing through the horizon .",
    "it should be noticed however , that after crossing the horizon once , the sign of either @xmath127 or @xmath128 should change and the radial infinities at @xmath129 is located inside the horizon at @xmath65 , which obeys the relation @xmath130 from regions where @xmath131 or @xmath132 we can cross the horizon once again to reach another region for which @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this last region is spacelike relative to where we started .",
    "if we started from near the other horizon @xmath64 ( i.e. from inside the region @xmath135 ) instead , we could have defined the new coordinates @xmath136 as @xmath137 then , introducing further @xmath138 and @xmath139 via @xmath140 the line element could be changed into @xmath141 where @xmath41 is implicitly defined in terms of the following relation : @xmath142 clearly the horizon at @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath143 , and the spatial infinity @xmath144 corresponds to @xmath145 once again , crossing the horizon does not encounter any singularity .",
    "crossing once from near @xmath64 means changing the sign of one of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , while crossing twice would result in changing the signs of both @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "( @xmath138 ) axises point upwards , and the @xmath148 ( @xmath139 ) axises point towards right .",
    "horizontal slashed lines represent repeated occurrences of the eight zones depicted in the middle.,width=529 ]    the whole process for constructing the global structure of the spacetime is summarized in the penrose diagram depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the diagram is in fact an infinite , periodic strip with 8 different zones in each period .",
    "the nonsingular , kruskal - like coordinates systems are defined in each zone as follows :    * zone i : @xmath149 * zone ii : @xmath150 * zone iii : @xmath151 * zone iv : @xmath152 * zone v : @xmath153 * zone vi : @xmath154 * zone vii : @xmath155 * zone viii : @xmath156        to the left of zone iii , there exists another zone vii@xmath157 which look exactly like zone vii , and to the right of zone vii , there exists another zone iii@xmath157 which look exactly like zone iii .",
    "hence the similar causal structure repeat horizontally and form an infinite periodic strip of penrose diagram",
    ".    it may be advantageous to depict the penrose diagram on a cylindrical surface by identifying the left boundary of zone iii with the right boundary of zone vii ( i.e. identifying zone iii@xmath157 with zone iii , zone vii@xmath157 with zone vii etc . ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "this way of depicting the penrose diagram will make the periodicity of the penrose diagram more manifest . from figure 3",
    ", it can be seen that there two diamond - shaped radially bounded regions which are relatively spacelike to each other and both admit a static coordinate description .",
    "each of these diamond shaped region ( one consists of zone i and v , the other consists of zone iii and vii ) has a similar causal structure to that of the usual de sitter spacetime .",
    "however , putting together the global structure of our spacetime is much richer than the usual de sitter spacetime .",
    "the 5-dimensional metric ( [ metric ] ) admits a 4-dimensional interpretation via kk reduction . looking back at ( [ metric ] )",
    ", we see that it can only be kk reduced along the killing coordinate @xmath0 to avoid the appearance of massive kk modes .",
    "since there is no off - diagonal element in the metric , the kk reduced theory will not contain any gauge field but with only a scalar liouville field coupling to 4d einstein gravity .",
    "the kk reduction formula reads to denote the original line element in 5 dimensions in order to distinguish with the reduced 4 dimensional line element @xmath158 . ]",
    "@xmath159 where @xmath160 is a 4d scalar field .",
    "the 4d metric and the scalar field @xmath160 take the values @xmath161,\\label{zeroboost1}\\\\ e^{-2\\varphi/\\sqrt{3 } } & = \\frac{f(x)}{\\alpha ^2(x+y)^2}. \\label{zeroboost2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the kk reduction can be better understood on the level of actions .",
    "the action for the 5d vacuum einstein equation @xmath5 is @xmath162 up to possible boundary counter terms which we omit . after the kk reduction ( [ red ] ) , the action becomes @xmath163 thus we see that the field @xmath160 is a liouville field in 4 dimensions and the 5d cosmological constant @xmath6 becomes the coupling constant of the 4d liouville field .",
    "it is tempting to make a boost in the @xmath164 plane of the metric ( [ metric ] ) before doing the kk reduction .",
    "this will produce a maxwell field in the reduced 4 dimensional theory .",
    "to do so , we first make the boost @xmath165 inserting the above into the metric ( [ metric ] ) , we have @xmath166,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have changed the rapidity @xmath167 into the boost velocity @xmath168 via @xmath169 now making a kk reduction along the @xmath170 axis using the formula @xmath171 we get the reduced 4 dimensional metric @xmath172 , \\label{sol1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with the 4d maxwell potential @xmath173 } { f(x)-k^2 g(y)h(z ) } dt\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the 4d liouville field @xmath174 defining @xmath175 the reduced form of the action ( [ act ] ) reads @xmath176 which is clearly an einstein - maxwell - liouville theory .",
    "so we have obtained an exact solution to the einstein - maxwell - liouville theory through the above process .",
    "it is easy to see that at @xmath177 the maxwell field vanishes and the einstein - liouville solution ( [ zeroboost1])-([zeroboost2 ] ) is recovered .",
    "in this section we shall consider the limiting case @xmath178 for the spacetime ( [ metric ] ) , i.e. @xmath179 .",
    "\\label{m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] what is special about the @xmath178 case ? it is clear from section [ hor ] that the area of horizons now become infinite , signifying their noncompactness .",
    "thus the case @xmath2 corresponds to a ricci flat spacetime with two acceleration horizons , which may be identified as a minkowski spacetime written in a particular accelerating coordinate system .    to justify the last statement and further understand the meaning of the particular coordinate system chosen in writing ( [ m2 ] )",
    ", we will borrow some exterior geometric technology which can be found in @xcite .    instead of the metric ( [ m2 ] )",
    ", we will actually be investigating its wick rotated version @xmath180\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + \\left.\\frac{{dx}^2}{1-x^2}+(1-x^2){d\\phi}^2\\right\\ } , \\label{m2prime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 has replaced the role of complexified time coordinate @xmath182 .",
    "now consider the following rotational surface embedded in a 5-dimensional euclidean space with coordinates @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the embedding equation reads @xmath185 for fixed constants @xmath186 , this equation describes a compact 4-dimensional surface of topology @xmath187 . in fact , the surface described by the above equation can be thought of as the result of pulling the center of a 2-sphere of radius @xmath188 everywhere around another 2-sphere of radius @xmath189 .",
    "we can parametrize the above surface in 5-dimensional euclidean space as follows : @xmath190 where @xmath191 provided @xmath192 takes the special value @xmath193 for variable values of @xmath192 , eqs .",
    "( [ p1])-([p5 ] ) is just another parametrization of the 5-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "making some further coordinate transform @xmath194 it can be checked that the 5-dimensional euclidean metric @xmath195 is equivalent to the metric ( [ m2prime ] ) . in other words , the space described by the",
    "metric ( [ m2prime ] ) is just the 5-dimensional euclidean space written in a subtle coordinate system .",
    "in such a coordinate system , all constant @xmath27 hyper surfaces have the same @xmath187 topology , however only the @xmath196 case corresponds to an ideal @xmath187 local geometry .    now looking back on eqs .",
    "( [ p1])-([p5 ] ) , we can see that the wick rotation from @xmath181 to @xmath182 corresponds to wick rotation of @xmath197 , or , from the point of view of embedding surfaces , corresponds to changing the equation ( [ embed ] ) into @xmath198 therefore , following the same argument as above , the constant @xmath27 hyper surfaces in the metric ( [ m2 ] ) are all topologically equivalent to @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is a 2-dimensional hyperbolic surface with equation @xmath201 .    before ending this section ,",
    "let us remark that the global structure analysis made in section 4 still holds for the @xmath2 case , the only difference lies in that we need to replace @xmath202 everywhere by @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the kk reduction made in section 5 also holds for @xmath2 , however for vanishing @xmath6 the field @xmath160 is no longer a liouville field but only dilaton field .",
    "therefore ( [ sol1])-([sol3 ] ) correspond to a solution to the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory for vanishing @xmath6 .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) studied in this paper turns out to be much more interesting than it first appears to be .",
    "the existence of the two acceleration horizons makes the global structure of the spacetime quite nontrivial . to make comparisons ,",
    "let us remind that the usual de sitter spacetime has only one acceleration horizon which is spherically symmetric with constant scalar curvature .",
    "now the metric ( [ metric ] ) processes _ two _ disjoint acceleration horizons and the scalar curvatures of both horizons are not constants .",
    "the de sitter c - metric @xcite with vanishing mass and charges in 4 dimensions do have two acceleration horizons but the two horizons in that case are located in two causally disconnected regions in the spacetime , so that each observer in that spacetime can perceive the existence of only one of them .",
    "however the two acceleration horizons in ( [ metric ] ) can be perceived from a single causal patch of the spacetime .    moreover , via kk reductions , the metric can be reduced into an exact solution for the einstein - maxwell - liouville / dilaton theory , which is of course nontrivial in 4 dimensions .",
    "the rich global structure certainly deserves further explorations .",
    "it provides one further example for the richness of higher dimensional gravities besides existing ones on the one hand , and it also indicates the unexpectedly many varieties of einstein manifolds on the other .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) represents an empty , non - spherical symmetric einstein manifold .",
    "traditionally more familiar examples of such manifolds are de sitter spacetime ( for @xmath32 ) or minkowski spacetime ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask how many different varieties of such manifolds exist in higher dimensions .",
    "we do not have an answer for this question at the moment , but we do have some other explicit examples of this kind which is similar to but essentially different from the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "one such example is @xmath203 , \\label{newmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath204 this is also an exact solution to the 5-dimensional vacuum einstein equation @xmath5 with cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "however , as we can see from the above metric , it is @xmath27 that is playing the role of radial coordinate in stead of @xmath41 .",
    "there are two acceleration horizons located at @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , the geometry of the @xmath206 slice is a conformal 3-sphere which can be seen by the transformation @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) is more symmetric in some sense",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the global structure of the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) in a similar fashion as did in this paper .",
    "also , the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) may be used to construct exact solutions to the 4 dimensional einstein - maxwell - liouville / dilaton theory via kk reduction .",
    "what is intentionally left untouched in this paper is the @xmath208 case of the metric .",

    "<S> we present and analyze an exact 5-dimensional vacuum solution of einstein equation with non - negative cosmological constant written in a c - metric like coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the metric does not contain any black hole horizons in it , but has two acceleration horizons and a static patch in between . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system , horizon geometry and global structures are analyzed in detail , and in the case of vanishing cosmological constant , a simple exterior geometric interpretation is given . </S>",
    "<S> the metric possesses a spacelike killing coordinate @xmath0 besides the timelike coordinate @xmath1 , along which the spacetime can be dimensionally reduced via kaluza - klein mechanism and interpreted as einstein gravity coupled to a 4 dimensional liouville field ( and a maxwell field as well if a boost operation is performed before the kaluza - klein reduction ) . </S>"
