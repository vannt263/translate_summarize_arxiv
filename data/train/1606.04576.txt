    "<S> circular rnas ( circrnas ) are a class of rna with an important role in micro rna ( mirna ) regulation recently discovered in human and various other eukaryotes as well as in archaea . here , we have analyzed rna - seq data obtained from _ </S>",
    "<S> enterococcus faecalis _ and _ escherichia coli _ in a way similar to previous studies performed on eukaryotes . </S>",
    "<S> we report observations of circrnas in rna - seq data that are reproducible across multiple experiments performed with different protocols or growth conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> circular rnas ( circrnas ) are a type of rna transcripts the 3ends of which are ligated to their 5ends during splicing . </S>",
    "<S> they were first discovered in plants @xcite almost 40 years ago and relatively little studied for several decades . </S>",
    "<S> recently , an incidental discovery of a high abundance of circrnas in human @xcite and their role in micro rna ( mirna ) regulation @xcite attracted the attention of many . </S>",
    "<S> large scale searches for novel circrnas was performed in animals @xcite and archaea @xcite leading to hundreds of previously unknown circularised transcripts . </S>",
    "<S> while it has been shown that splicing in bacteria occurs , though much more rarely than in eukaryotes @xcite , that circrnas can be synthesized by bacteria in vivo using genetic engineering , and that those transcripts can even direct translations of proteins in those organisms , it is commonly believed that all natural transcripts in bacteria are linear @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is a slightly modified version of the well established pipeline used by memczak et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to analyse our recently published transcriptome data on _ e. faecalis _ </S>",
    "<S> v583 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the major difference of our version of the pipeline is that we removed the requirement for break points to be flanked by gu / ag sites , as such a configuration is characteristic of spliceosomal splicing , absent in bacteria . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the algorithm reports as potential circrna all cases where the 3 region of a read can be mapped upstream of its 5 region and where the sequence on the reference genome near them corresponds to the one in the read insert ( figure 1(a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery pipeline was applied to the transcriptome coined `` illuminast '' [ sra accession i d : srr1770393 ] in our previous nomenclature @xcite , leading to a total of 134 circrna candidates ( table s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on these , we built a custom database of junctions encompassing 250 nt on each side of the predicted junctions ( figure 1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this database was subsequently used as reference against which we aligned whole reads directly . </S>",
    "<S> after alignment , we counted the number of reads that spanned the junction , and reads extending 8 nt or more on both sides of a junction were termed `` long spanning reads '' ( figure 1(b ) ) .     + ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    alignment of the same `` illuminast '' transcriptome reads yielded an enrichment of long spanning reads ( table s1 ) caused by relaxed constraints since anchors in our 50 nt long reads were required to be 20 nt long : a junction needed to be in a region of 10 nt to be identified by the detection algorithm , which , assuming uniform rna fragmentation , would happen in 20% of the cases . </S>",
    "<S> few large deviations from the typically observed two - to - ten - fold enrichment ( table s1 ) are plausibly explained by fragmentation biases in the sequencing sample preparation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we mapped reads from four other _ e. faecalis _ v583 transcriptomes @xcite named `` kth '' , `` kthr '' , `` rt '' and `` st '' [ sra accession ids : srr1766416 , srr1769261 , srr1769749 , srr1769750 ] acquired using different experimental protocols , growth conditions and sequencing platforms . out of the previously mentioned 134 candidates , 81 ( 60% ) were confirmed by at least two long spanning reads from at least two transcriptomes ( table s1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> removing cases with multiply mapped read fragments and retaining only candidates supported by at least five non - duplicated reads , we extracted a list of 23 transcripts with lengths between 56 and 549 nt for further analysis ( table s1 ) . among these , 15 ( 65% ) were found with long spanning reads in at least two transcriptomes , and only one case ( circ_000082 corresponding to the srna ref114 ) was observed only in `` illuminast '' . </S>",
    "<S> we then verified that , while antisense transcription was observed in the neighborhood of several candidates , in all but one case no long antisense spanning reads were observed , with the exception of the candidate `` circ_000104 '' , discussed in more detail below . we retained circ_000104 because it was found in all transcriptomes analyzed , had the highest number of long - spanning reads in the kth transcriptome , and the antisense signal across its junction was about 20 times weaker than the direct signal . in all the 23 cases , </S>",
    "<S> coverage signal clearly indicates presence of transcripts across the entire candidate sequences ( see `` the pprnomebrowse ' ' @xcite ) .    in order to estimate the false discovery rate of our procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we generated a database of 5000 tail - to - head junctions up to 600 nt apart randomly distributed over the genome with a uniform distribution and assessed the number of long spanning reads found covering those junctions . indeed </S>",
    "<S> not a single one was reported while over 95% the database had reads aligned in an irrelevant way near the junction , strengthening the confidence in our analysis of the true transcriptomic data .    </S>",
    "<S> of the 23 retrieved circrna candidates , 11 correspond to short rnas ( srnas ) previously described , the majority of which having so far uncharacterised functions , 5 overlap with untranslated regions ( utrs ) sometimes including part of a neighbouring coding region , 6 roughly match the locations of annotated genes ( including two candidates in the vicinity of _ ef_0104/arca _ ) and 1 coincides with a tryptophan transfer rna ( _ trna - trp1 _ ) ( tables1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking observation is a set of 3 candidates ( circ_000023 , circ_000025 and circ_000104 ) in a region we recently reported as containing an antisense organisation of two or three ncrnas called ref85a / b and ref86 @xcite . on the forward strand </S>",
    "<S> , we observes two tail - to - head junctions linking coordinates 1.894.992 to 1.895.401 and 1.894.992/-3 to 1.895.183/-6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> position 1.894.992 coincides with the mapped transcription start site ( tss ) of ref85a@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other coordinates correspond to the 3 of ref85b and to a position 20 nt upstream of the 3 of ref86 on the opposite strand ( figure [ fig : ref8586 ] ) . on the reverse strand , the detected junction links position 1.895.168 to 1.895.273 , i.e. , 2 nt upstream of the reported beginning of ref86 to exactly its reported end .    </S>",
    "<S> while the role of such an intricate organization remains elusive , the above observation clarifies that ref85a and ref85b originate from the same primary transcript and that ref86 may indeed interact with ref85a / b .        </S>",
    "<S> while it is well known that artifacts in the reverse transcription , particularly template switching , may lead to junction reads similar to those resulting from splicing or circularisation , those effects are expected to be random @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of non - identical ( long ) spanning reads across multiple experiments is an argument against artifactual origin . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the clear tendency for the candidates to be found in non - protein coding regions ( utrs and ncrnas ) that constitute a minor portion of the genome strengthens the biological origin of our observations .    to verify that the effect is not limited to the particular bacterial strain used or to our experimental protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we then applied our discovery pipeline to 23 publicly available rna - seq datasets of _ </S>",
    "<S> e. coli_. datasets were taken from the sra database and chosen arbitrarily among experiments done with single - end strand - specific standard rna - seq on the illumina sequencing platform , on strain mg1655 or closely related ones , and preferentially performed at high coverage ( accession numbers for the datasets and results of the analyses are given in table s2 ) .    from the 23 transcriptomes , we obtained a total of about 20 000 </S>",
    "<S> predictions that cluster in 2660 candidate loci ( table s2 ) , indicating that predictions accross different samples lead to similar positions . among those 2660 loci , </S>",
    "<S> 316 were observed in at least 7 transcriptomes ( table s2 ) .    to provide a global overview , we plotted the density of predictions across all 23 samples in figure 2 and , in figure s1 , the coverage signal calculated from the reads on which predictions are based for the 316 regions . </S>",
    "<S> the two strongest peaks in the plots correspond to _ csrb _ and _ csrc _ , two short non - coding rnas with the same function : binding multiple copies of the csra protein , which is itself an inhibitor of translation , in order to inhibit its function and consequently increase protein synthesis . </S>",
    "<S> both have similar structures , forming many hair - pins on an otherwise opened backbone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> smaller peaks in figure 2 correspond to _ hdea _ and _ b _ , an operon coding for two well known proteins in _ e. coli _ , _ yehd _ , a region annotated as putative protein , and rnpb , the catalytic subunit of rnase p. the latter is also found circularised in _ </S>",
    "<S> e. faecalis _ as candidates circ_000068 , and especially circ_000048 which is one the strongest signals discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we discovered a series of potential circular rna candidates in bacteria using publicly available discovery pipeline and rna - seq data . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that a number of the candidates appear to be reproducible across experiments with different rna - seq protocols and platforms and the case of two or possibly three ncrnas antisense in _ </S>",
    "<S> e. faecalis _ to each other showing signs of circularisation in an intricate manner .    </S>",
    "<S> a result of our analysis is that most candidates were not found in coding regions but rather in functional rna transcripts or utrs . in many cases , candidates found were reproducible across experiments with good accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the rnpb srna shows one of the strongest signals in both _ </S>",
    "<S> e. faecalis _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> e. coli_. we finally remark that in all samples , the signal from putative circrna was weak compared to the total amount of rna detected in the corresponding regions , suggesting that either the circularized form is rare byproduct of a post - transcriptional process or that the circular form is not well captured by the rna - seq procedure , for instance by escaping fragmentation . </S>"
