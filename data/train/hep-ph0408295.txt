    "a reinterpretation of the gauge hierarchy problem by arkani - hamed , dimopolous and dvali ( add ) @xcite involves an alteration in the behaviour of gravity at small distances owing to the existence of large extra compactified space dimensions . in the add scenario ,",
    "the gauge interactions are confined to a 3-brane while gravity propagates in all the dimensions .",
    "the effective planck scale @xmath2 in this model gets related to the usual planck scale by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius of compactification and @xmath5 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath4 for a given @xmath5 such that the fundamental string scale comes down to @xmath6 1 tev . such a low value of @xmath2 is also exciting from the point of view of studying quantum gravity at present and future colliders .",
    "various signals of graviton production and virtual graviton exchange have been proposed in several papers in the last few years @xcite .",
    "these are also reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another important general feature of quantum gravity theories , apart from the requirement of extra dimensions , is the existence of a minimal length scale ( mls ) . in string theory ,",
    "such a minimal length is suggested since strings can not probe distances smaller than the string scale . if the energy of a string reaches the planck scale , string excitations can occur causing its extension @xcite . even though we are inspired by this assertion of quantum gravity theories ,",
    "nevertheless we implement the notion of a minimal length scale phenomenologically .",
    "note that in some fundamental theory , like string theory , such a notion may have a different meaning and interpretation . in the context of large extra dimensional models exhibiting a low fundamental scale of @xmath2 of order 1 tev ,",
    "the existence of a minimal length becomes phenomenologically important if we take it to be around an inverse tev , viz .",
    "@xmath7 . in the add model , for an amplitude involving virtual gravitons",
    ", one has to sum over an infinite tower of graviton kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "the result is divergent and to cure the divergence an _ ad - hoc _ cutoff of the order of @xmath8 is used , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a very attractive feature of the mls scenario is that one can sum over the entire kk graviton tower because the contribution of higher energy kk states is smoothly cut off , as we shall see later , rendering the amplitude finite .",
    "this constitutes the main motivation for incorporating the effects of a minimal length scale in the add model .",
    "this also leads to a significant deviation of the bounds on the conventional add model parameters , e.g. @xmath2 , derived from collider searches , as we shall see later .",
    "we define the mls scenario to mean the add model with the idea of a minimal length @xmath10 incorporated in it with @xmath10 to be of the order of tev@xmath11 .",
    "the uncertainty in position measurement now can not be smaller than @xmath10 , which means that the standard commutation relation between position and momentum needs to be modified @xcite . in the minimal length scheme , since distances less than @xmath12 do not exist , the compton wavelength ( @xmath13 ) of a particle can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "however , we suppose that even though the wave vector @xmath14 is bounded from above , the momentum @xmath15 can be made as large as possible . similarly , to maintain the same dispersion relation the frequency @xmath16 is restricted from above while the energy @xmath17 can go up arbitrarily .",
    "this immediately requires that the standard relations @xmath18 and @xmath19 have to be modified .",
    "this can be realised by introducing the following ansatz for the modified relations , known as the unruh relations @xcite @xmath20 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "l_{p } \\omega(e)&=&\\tanh^{1/\\gamma } \\left[\\left(\\frac{e}{m_{s}}\\right)^{\\gamma}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a positive constant .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath22 for simplicity and set @xmath23 .",
    "the above simple relations capture the essence of a minimal length scale : as @xmath15 ( or @xmath17 ) becomes very large , @xmath14 ( or @xmath16 ) approaches the upper bound @xmath24 and hence one can not probe arbitrarily small length and time scales . the relations ( [ dispersion ] ) lead to a generalized position - momentum and energy - time uncertainty principle which can be written in a lorentz covariant form as @xmath25=i   \\,\\,\\frac{\\partial p_{\\mu}}{\\partial k_{\\nu}}.\\ ] ] as explained in @xcite , the effect of the modified relations ( [ dispersion ] ) can conveniently be accounted for by a simple redefinition of the momentum measure , which in one dimension is @xmath26 the lorentz invariant 4-momentum measure scales as @xmath27 where the jacobian matrix @xmath28 can be kept diagonal .    some applications of the minimal length scenario have been discussed in refs .  @xcite . in this paper , we study dilepton production at hadron colliders as a probe of extra dimensional models with a minimal length scale . to this end , we compute the dilepton production cross section at hadron colliders ( i ) in the sm ( the standard drell - yan process ) , ( ii ) in the conventional add model ( i.e. , with no minimal length ) , and ( iii ) in the mls scenario . in",
    "the add model and in the mls scenario , apart from the sm diagrams , the dilepton production cross section receives contributions from diagrams involving virtual gravitons coupled to quarks and gluons . as mentioned previously , for diagrams involving virtual gravitons",
    "the amplitude is a sum over an infinite tower of kk states having masses @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an integer .",
    "each state couples to fermions with a strength @xmath31 and a summation over the kk states enhances the effective strength to @xmath32 .",
    "the derivation of the feynman rules for the add model can be found in @xcite and the expression for the drell - yan differential cross section is displayed in @xcite . in the expression for the squared matrix - element the interference term between the sm diagram and the diagram with graviton exchange goes like @xmath33 , while the pure graviton term goes like @xmath34 . in appendix",
    "b of ref .",
    "@xcite , an expression for @xmath33 has been derived after summing over the graviton kk tower : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the partonic center - of - mass energy .",
    "the integral @xmath37 is ultraviolet divergent , showing that the summation over the graviton kk states is infinite , as mentioned before .",
    "but in the mls scenario , because of the unruh relations , the integral is modulated by a factor @xmath38 which smoothly cuts off the contribution of the higher energy kk states .",
    "hence we can perform the integration over all the kk states in place of @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ fmls ] ) . ] : @xmath40 the sech - square function for large @xmath41 goes like exp(@xmath42 ) which damps the power law growth of @xmath41 , thus avoiding the need for an _ ad - hoc _ cutoff as in @xmath43 .",
    "the divergence is thus dynamically remedied by the requirement of minimal length .",
    "another important modification due to the mls is the change in the cross section due to the rescaling of the momentum measure given in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check , as derived in @xcite , that the phase space integration in the total cross section picks up the following modification factor : @xmath44 where @xmath30 runs over the four initial and final states in a @xmath45 process , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the total initial and final four momenta in a @xmath45 process .",
    "we work out this modification factor for the process we are studying viz .",
    "@xmath48 , where @xmath49 are the initial state partons . using eqs .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) and ( [ scale ] ) , we can easily show that @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the momentum fractions of the hadrons carried by the initial state partons , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the pseudorapidities and @xmath55 is the common transverse momentum of the final state leptons .",
    "it can be easily checked that in the decoupling limit @xmath56 , the phase space correction factor goes to unity .",
    "in @xcite , the effect of virtual graviton exchange has been studied for dilepton production in the conventional add model",
    ". a lower bound of @xmath2 in the 1 to 3.5 tev range ( tevatron run i and ii ) and 6.5 to 12.8 tev range ( lhc ) has been obtained at 95% c.l . by varying @xmath5 in the range 2 to 7 . to incorporate the effects of the minimal length",
    ", we modify the expression for the differential cross section for the drell - yan process given in @xcite according to eqs .",
    "( [ fmls ] ) and ( [ mod ] ) .",
    "( 4,6 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0,3 ) ( -0.2,5)(a ) ( -0.2,2)(b )    fig .  1 contains the results of our numerical computation .",
    "fig ( 1a ) shows the dilepton production cross section , integrated over dilepton invariant masses greater than 250 gev and over the pseudorapidity range @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as a function of the scale @xmath8 for @xmath59 collisions at the upgraded tevatron ( run ii ) operating at an energy of @xmath60 tev and an integrated luminosity of 2 @xmath61 .",
    "we have used the mrs2001 lo parton densities evolution of the parton densities is also not numerically sensitive to this issue . a similar conclusion has been drawn in @xcite in the context of black hole production in hadron colliders .",
    "we thank s.  hossenfelder for bringing this point and ref .",
    "@xcite to our attention . ] .",
    "the two curves shown in fig .",
    "( 1a ) are for the conventional add model in eq .",
    "( [ fadd ] ) by the leading terms yielding @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 , we have used the full expressions for the integral appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fadd ] ) . ] and mls scenario respectively .",
    "we have taken @xmath66 for the curves shown in the figure .",
    "we note that the @xmath5 dependence appears in the graviton summation and in the mls scenario the sech - square modulation of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ fmls ] ) renders that dependence rather weak . ] .",
    "we have also shown the 2-@xmath67 upper and lower limits of the sm , assuming only statistical errors .",
    "we observe that the cross section for the mls is smaller than that for add .",
    "this is mainly because of the exponential suppression of the phase space factor . for the add case , a bound of about 1.63 tev results at the 95% c.l . , but this bound is diluted in the mls scenario where we get a 95% bound of about 1.45 tev .",
    "( 1b ) displays the case of lhc ( @xmath68 collisions at @xmath69 tev ) , where we assume a luminosity of 100 @xmath61 and integrate over dilepton invariant masses greater than 600 gev and over the pseudorapidity range @xmath70 .",
    "again , we have taken @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain the lower bound on @xmath2 to be about 7 tev for the conventional add model which goes down to about 6 tev for the mls scenario .",
    "a minimal length scale is a generic prediction of quantum gravity theories . in brane world models , like the add model",
    ", the implications of such a minimal length can be probed in collider experiments in the tev range .",
    "we study dilepton production at hadron colliders mediated by virtual graviton exchange in an add model having a minimal length of the order of the inverse of the effective string scale .",
    "the technical benefit of introducing the minimal length into the add model is that the sum over the graviton tower is regulated which does not any more require the introduction of an _ ad - hoc _ cutoff .",
    "we find that the bounds are substantially lowered in such a scenario as compared to the conventional add model without the minimal length scale .",
    "our choice of studying the dilepton production cross section in hadron colliders is an illustrative one ; similar analyses can be carried out for other processes . in all cases , the suppression factors associated with minimal length would relax the existing constraints .",
