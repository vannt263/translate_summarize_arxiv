    "observations of high redshift galaxies are essential to understand cosmic reionization .",
    "although current surveys have reached redshifts @xmath13 @xcite , it is generally believed that the sources detected so far , usually rare and bright galaxies , are not the dominant contributors to reionization @xcite .",
    "instead , reionization is likely powered by the large number of galaxies that are still below the detection limit .    even without detecting these faint galaxies individually",
    ", their cumulative radiations may still tell us much about their properties .",
    "indeed , the bulk of their emission , mostly in the band between the lyman limit and the visible light , is redshifted into the near infrared ( ir ) at present time .",
    "therefore , the near infrared background ( nirb ) which is obtained after removing the contributions from the solar system , the milky way and low-@xmath2 galaxies , could provide a wealth of information on high redshift galaxies , such as their integrated emissivity and large scale clustering properties .",
    "the nirb measurement has a history dating back to more than two decades ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "early measurements gave a nirb flux @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these works showed that a non - zero residual remains after the foreground and the emission from known galaxies are removed @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that pop iii stars could possibly be the sources of such leftover signal .",
    "if true , this residual would be an exquisite tool to study pop iii stars . however , not long afterwards , @xcite and @xcite found that this scenario needs a very high star formation efficiency and may overpredict the high-@xmath2 dropouts galaxies mini - quasars powered by accretion on to intermediate mass black holes with spectra similar to local ultra - luminous x - ray sources is disfavored on the basis of the unresolved x - ray background intensity constraints @xcite , unless these objects are highly absorbed by the surrounding gas . ] . to solve this problem , we need either an alternative theoretical explanation ( proved hard to be found ) , or a more accurate determination of the residual flux , or both .    due to the difficulties in foreground subtraction @xcite , in recent observational works",
    "more attentions are paid to the angular fluctuations . in such observations ,",
    "the influence of strong but smooth foregrounds , such as the zodiacal light , is reduced , and one can also infer the large scale clustering properties of the unknown sources @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements @xcite have obtained angular power spectra of the source - subtracted nirb ( i.e. all resolved galaxies have been removed ) at wavelengths from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "these angular power spectrum measurements show that the sources have a large clustering signal up to degree scales .",
    "the source - subtracted nirb fluctuations are found to be much higher than the theoretically predicted contribution from low-@xmath2 faint galaxies .",
    "although @xcite favored a scenario in which the observed fluctuations come from pop iii stars , @xcite showed that , to be consistent with the electron scattering optical depth measured by wmap @xcite , the contribution from high-@xmath2 galaxies ( including pop iii stars ) must be smaller by at least an order of magnitude than what is observed . instead , @xcite suggested recently that a large fraction of the observed nirb fluctuations comes from the diffuse light of intrahalo stars at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath17 1 to 4 ) . while an intriguing idea , this explanation relies on the poorly known fraction and spectral energy distribution of intrahalo stars",
    ". it also predicts , contrary to the faint distant galaxies hypothesis , that fluctuations induced by the much closer intrahalo stars should extend into the optical bands , where the light from first galaxies is blanketed by intervening intergalactic neutral hydrogen .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite stressed the importance of nonlinear effects in theoretical calculations as a possible way to reconcile the theory with data .",
    "there have also been proposals that the sources of these fluctuations are lower redshift galaxies @xcite , but this possibility has become less attractive by now .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently reconstructed the emissivity history from the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of observed galaxies , and found that the fluctuations from the known galaxy population below the detection limit are unable to account for the observed clustering signal on sub - degree angular scales .",
    "to make further progress , it is essential to make more accurate predictions of the nirb contributed by pop iii stars and the galaxies before reionization , using models which are consistent with _ all _ current observational constraints , including both the high redshift lfs and reionization .    in this paper , we attempt to make the most detailed theoretical nirb model developed so far , with predictions on both the absolute flux and the angular power spectrum contributed by high-@xmath2 galaxies . to do this",
    ", we used a simulation with detailed treatment of the relevant physics of star / galaxy formation , including gas dynamics , radiative cooling , supernova explosion , photoionization and heating , and especially a detailed treatment of chemical feedback @xcite .",
    "the lfs of high redshift galaxies in the simulation match remarkably well with observations , this is the starting point of our nirb model .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ methods ]",
    "we introduce the simulation , and describe the steps to calculate the nirb absolute flux and the angular power spectrum . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results and compare them with observations .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "[ appendix ] we compare the different approximate solutions for the analytical calculation of the emissivity . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the same cosmological parameters as in @xcite : @xmath18=0.26 , @xmath19=0.74 , @xmath20=0.73 , @xmath21=0.041 , @xmath22 and @xmath23=0.8 .",
    "the transfer function is from @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "at @xmath24 , the cumulative flux of the nirb observed at frequency @xmath25 is the integrated contribution of sources whose emission is shifted into a band of central frequency @xmath25 .",
    "following @xcite , we write it as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the proper distance , @xmath28 is the rest frame frequency , @xmath29 is the comoving specific emissivity , @xmath30 is the hubble parameter given by @xmath31 in a flat @xmath32cdm cosmology , @xmath33 is the speed of light .",
    "the effective optical depth of absorbers between redshift 0 and @xmath2 , @xmath34 , is composed of two parts : the line absorption and the continuum absorption ; we use the expressions in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the emissivity ( see also appendix for further discussions on subtleties related to the various approximations used in the literature ) from the results of the simulation presented in @xcite , which includes a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment developed by @xcite . in our model , both pop ii stars and pop iii stars are assumed to follow the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , for pop ii stars the mass range is @xmath35 , while for pop iii stars the mass range is set to be @xmath36 .",
    "some recent works indicate that pop iii stars may not be so massive as was predicted previously , but may be limited to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "our choice then corresponds to an upper limit to the contribution of these sources . using this simulation",
    ", @xcite generated the lfs of galaxies down to the magnitude far below the current observation limits at high redshifts .",
    "in the redshift range @xmath38 , the simulated lfs match the observed ones almost perfectly in the overlapping luminosity range .",
    "suppose the specific luminosity of the @xmath39-th galaxy in the simulation box is @xmath40 at redshift @xmath2 , the comoving specific emissivity is then galaxies reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we ignore the effect of dust in current calculations . furthermore , we will show latter that the high-@xmath2 galaxies are inadequate to explain the amplitude of the observed fluctuations , considering the dust absorption would only strength this point . ]",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the comoving volume of the simulation , @xmath43 is the total number of galaxies in the simulation box at redshift @xmath2 .    in the emissivity calculation , we must correct for rare bright galaxies that are not caught by the simulation due to the finite box size ( @xmath44mpc ) .",
    "we follow the steps in @xcite .",
    "we first calculate the absolute magnitude corresponding to the mean luminosity of the two brightest galaxies in the simulation box , @xmath45 . the contribution ( to be added to the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) ) from galaxies brighter than this magnitude is obtained by integration @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the luminosity of the brightest galaxy in the simulation ( we assume all rare bright galaxies have the same spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this one ) , @xmath48 is the luminosity corresponding to the uv absolute magnitude @xmath49 .",
    "the wavelength used to calculate the absolute uv magnitude in this paper is @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the frequency corresponding to this wavelength . in observations , the selected wavelength corresponding to the uv absolute magnitude may be somewhat different in different measurements and at different redshifts @xcite , however , our results are not sensitive to such differences . for the lf @xmath52 in the redshift range @xmath38",
    ", we use the schechter formula @xcite with the redshift - dependent parameters given by @xcite ( see their sec .",
    "7.5 ) , who fitted the observed lfs in @xmath53 and extrapolated them to higher redshifts . for redshifts above 10 ,",
    "we simply add an exponential tail normalized to the simulated lf amplitude at @xmath45 .",
    "we find that this results only a small correction .",
    "as discussed below ( see also bottom panel of figure [ inu0 ] ) , @xmath54 of the high-@xmath2 galaxy contribution to the nirb flux comes from sources at @xmath55 where the correction is at most @xmath56 .",
    "this correction is also applied to the calculation of ionizing photons below .    for each galaxy ,",
    "the radiation comes from two different mechanisms : the stellar emission and the nebular emission .",
    "the former comes directly from the surface of stars , while the latter is generated by the ionized nebula around stars and depends on the fraction of ionizing photons that can not escape into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , i.e. , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the escape fraction .",
    "ionizing photons escaping from galaxies would ionize the igm ; such ionized gas could also produce the nebular emission .",
    "however , due to the very low recombination rate , as shown in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , its emissivity is much weaker than the radiation from galaxies , so we ignore this contribution in this paper .",
    "the igm contribution to the nirb fluctuations is also negligible @xcite .    to determine the escape fraction averaged over the galaxy populations present at a given redshift",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "first we compute the number of ionizing photons emitted per baryon in collapsed objects as : @xmath59}{\\sum_{i=1}^nm^i_{\\rm gas}},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the emission rate of ionizing photos from pop ii stars ( this quantity depends on both the age and the metallicity of the stellar population ) corresponding to a continuous star formation rate @xmath61 .",
    "we derive this quantity from the starburst99 templates @xcite adopting the mean age , @xmath62 , and metallicity , @xmath63 , of each simulated galaxy .",
    "@xmath64 is the emission rate of ionizing photons for pop iii stars according to . and",
    "@xmath64 : the former corresponds to per unit star formation rate while the latter corresponds to per unit stellar mass .",
    "] @xmath65 is the gas content , @xmath66 is the mean star formation rate of pop ii stars in this galaxy , while @xmath67 is the cumulative mass of pop iii stars .",
    "we use a mean lifetime @xmath68  yr for massive pop iii stars .",
    "we then compare the above quantity with the number of ionizing photons per baryon in collapsed objects , @xmath69 , required by interpreting the observations as in @xcite ( the  mean \" value ) to get the escape fraction , i.e. , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the clumping factor . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath72 to get the minimum @xmath58 therefore the maximum contribution of the nebular emission to the nirb .",
    "we note that the clumping factor could be higher than 1 even at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite gives @xmath73 at @xmath74 by numerical simulations .",
    "our nebular emission is therefore reduced by about 10% to 60% from @xmath7 to @xmath75 if this clumping factor is adopted . however , for pop ii stars which are the dominant contributors to the nirb , the nebular emission is much smaller than the stellar emission .",
    "so the final reduction in the nirb would be much smaller .",
    "furthermore , we will show later that the flux from high redshift galaxies and pop iii stars is unable to explain the observed fluctuations level , so that a reduction in the nirb flux would in any case strengthen this conclusion .",
    "we plot the derived @xmath58 as a function of redshift in figure [ fesc ] .",
    "there is a clear trend of an increasing escape fraction towards higher redshifts ; it reaches 1 at @xmath76 . at @xmath7 , the final redshift of the simulation , @xmath77 .",
    "although required by reionization data , an increasing trend of @xmath78 has not yet been fully understood theoretically in spite of the several , often conflicting , studies on this problem .",
    "based on observations , @xcite concluded that @xmath79 when @xmath80 ; by combining the observations of lyman @xmath81 absorption and uv lf , and also using n - body simulations and semi - analytical prescriptions to model the ionizing background , @xcite found that for galaxies at @xmath82 , if the minimum mass of star forming galaxies corresponds to the hydrogen cooling threshold , @xmath83 ; @xcite used the star formation rate derived from gamma - ray burst observations to conclude that in the redshift range @xmath84 , @xmath85 ; @xcite , by radiation hydrodynamical simulations , found that at redshift 8 for galaxies with @xmath86 , @xmath83 , while for more massive galaxies @xmath87 , if a normal imf is adopted ; also via simulations , @xcite found @xmath88 when @xmath89 .",
    "the escape fraction derived by us is broadly consistent with these values .",
    "the important difference however is that our derivation of @xmath58 matches both the lf and the reionization history simultaneously , i.e. , a more phenomenological derivation , so that we can get around the detailed physical mechanisms of the escape fraction .",
    "different from our approach , @xcite computed the lfs of high redshift galaxies by means of semi - analytical models and derived the star formation efficiency @xmath90 required to match the observed ones .",
    "they found @xmath91 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath94 , which are consistent with our @xmath95 at those two redshifts . at higher redshifts , however , their escape fraction is somewhat lower than ours .    as a final remark , we underline that when computing the escape fraction , we do not make a distinction between pop iii and pop ii stars . in the calculation of @xmath96 ionizing photons from both populations",
    "are accounted for , @xmath58 can be regarded as a kind of  effective \" escape fraction averaged over the galaxy population . in principle , @xmath58 for pop iii stars should be higher due to their harder spectrum . however , as we will see in section [ results ] , pop iii stars only contribute a negligible flux to the present - day nirb , a more detailed modeling is then not necessary .          for the template of pop iii stars , @xmath105",
    ", we still use the spectrum in , but renormalize the nebular emission part by the factor @xmath57 .",
    "the luminosity of the @xmath39-th galaxy is then given by @xcite @xmath106 here the lyman @xmath81 emission in eq .",
    "( [ lya ] ) has already been included in @xmath107 .",
    "with the luminosity for each galaxy given as above , we can then obtain the emissivity according to eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "as an example , we plot the @xmath108 at redshifts 12.0 , 9.0 and 6.0 respectively in figure [ emiss ] . at high redshifts , the escape fraction @xmath109 , yielding a very weak ly@xmath81 line , since such emission is produced by recombinations of the ionized nebula around stars . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the escape fraction drops , while more ionizing photons are absorbed by the material around the stars , and producing more ly@xmath81 emission which is more clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "the part of spectrum with energy below 10.2 ev is of the most interest to us , here the spectrum becomes increasingly flatter at later time .",
    "for example , at @xmath110 , the slope of @xmath111 with @xmath112 , while at @xmath7 @xmath113 .",
    "this is clearly the result of an aging effect enhancing the rest frame optical / ir bands flux with respect to the uv ones .",
    "since the nirb from @xmath3 galaxies is dominated by the lower redshift galaxies ( @xmath114 ) , we do not expect to have a very steep nirb spectrum , as we will see in the results presented in sec .",

    "the analytical expression is given by @xcite , and we use the concentration parameter , @xmath132 , from @xcite which fits simulations well .",

    "even if a very different concentration parameter is adopted , its impacts are non - negligible only in the one - halo term which dominates the signal at small scales , where galaxy clustering is well below the shot noise .",

    "stated differently , halos with the highest pop iii stellar fraction are usually smaller and less luminous , and their contribution to the total luminosity is very low @xcite .",
    "this means that it is very difficult to find pop iii signatures by means of nirb observations .    in the bottom panel of figure [ inu0 ]",

    "after removal of galaxies brighter than @xmath165 , the flux from @xmath3 galaxies in our work is shown by diamonds , while flux from remaining galaxies in @xcite is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the flux from all galaxies ( solid line ) is about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than that from galaxies with @xmath3 ( crosses ) in our work .",
    "hence , without bright galaxy removal , @xmath174 galaxies largely dominate the nirb flux .",
    "however , if we remove the galaxies down to @xmath165 , the flux from the remaining galaxies at all redshifts in @xcite ( dashed line ) is comparable to that from the remaining galaxies with @xmath3 in our work . even considering the uncertainties on the faint - end of lfs ( the shaded regions ) , in the source - subtracted flux , galaxies at @xmath175 still contribute at least @xmath17620%@xmath17730% of the flux from galaxies at all redshifts and fainter than @xmath178 .",
    "so at least in principle we can access the signal of reionization sources by subtracting the bright galaxies from the nirb .    before moving to fluctuations , we emphasize that the expected contribution of high-@xmath2 galaxies ( including pop iii stars ) to the nirb flux is very small compared with the residual flux in the measurement of @xcite .",
    "these sources largely fall short of accounting for such residual ( @xmath179 in the wavelength range @xmath180 ) .",
    "it has to be reminded that the flux measured by matsumoto et al .",
    "is likely to be still dominated by incomplete zodiacal light subtraction , as discussed by @xcite , who concluded that no residual flux is present . considering the difficulties in modeling the zodiacal light accurately , currently the residual flux measurements are not very useful to constrain models .",
    "therefore , we will base all the conclusions in the present paper on the analysis of fluctuations only , see below .",

    ", we also see that the contributions of the @xmath3 galaxies ( dashed lines ) exceed the shot noise level on large angular scales ( @xmath187 ) , this means that the nirb fluctuations do have the potential to provide us information on the nature of the undetected reionization sources .",
    "however , the predicted amplitudes are only @xmath188 , which is even much smaller than the contribution from low-@xmath2 faint galaxies , and both the high-@xmath2 and low-@xmath2 contributions are much smaller than the observed values , which are at the @xmath189 level . even considering the uncertainties about the faint - end of lfs",
    ", the difference is still quite significant , again indicates the existence of one or more unknown component(s ) we are missing .",
    "somewhat surprisingly but interestingly , the missing component has a clustering signal very similar to that of the high redshift galaxies , and extends to degree angular scales .",
    "obviously , this component / foreground must be identified before we can make further progress and use the nirb to study reionization sources .",
    "next , we define the fluctuation amplitude @xmath190 , and plot its ratio to @xmath191 in figure [ deltaf_f ] .",
    "such relative fluctuation is almost independent of @xmath156 ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath192 4% at @xmath10 , with the only slight deviation of the @xmath193 band where it is somewhat lower than in redder bands , as a consequence of a deeper ( @xmath194 ) galaxy removal .",
    "nicely , the relative fluctuation agrees with that found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath195 increases with @xmath196 , i.e. , high redshift sources have higher relative fluctuations .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath197% for @xmath198 , while it reaches 12% if @xmath199 is adopted .",
    "it reflects the more biased spatial distributions of higher redshift sources .",
    "the relative fluctuation @xmath195 is only weakly dependent on the intrinsic properties of galaxies @xcite , but more so on the spatial clustering features .",
    "thus , @xmath195 is a key indicator to identify nirb sources ; yet , in practice , it is hard to get an accurate absolute flux .     as a function of @xmath200 for four different wavelengths . ]     galaxies ) fluctuations ( solid line ) at @xmath10 , the dashed line shows a @xmath201 law . ]",
    "the spectrum of the fluctuations , @xmath202 from all galaxies with @xmath3 at @xmath10 , shown in figure [ cl_spectrum ] , has a slope @xmath203 , with @xmath204 above 1  @xmath205 m .",
    "such slope is essentially the same as that of the flux , reflecting the above mentioned wavelength independency of @xmath195 .",
    "by combining high resolution cosmological n - body / hydrodynamical simulations and an analytical model , we predicted the contributions to the absolute flux and fluctuations of the nirb by high redshift ( @xmath3 ) galaxies , some of which harboring pop iii stars .",
    "this is the most robust and detailed theoretical calculation done so far , as we simultaneously match the lfs and reionization constraints .",
    "the simulations include the relevant physics of galaxy formation and a novel treatment of chemical feedback , by following the metallicity evolution and implementing the physics of pop iii / pop ii transition based on a critical metallicity criterion .",
    "it reproduces the observed uv lfs over the redshift range @xmath38 , and extend it to faint magnitudes far below the detection limit of current observations .",
    "we directly calculate the stellar emissivity from the simulations .",
    "we use starburst99 to generate metallicity and age dependent sed templates , then calculate the luminosity for each galaxy according to its current star formation rate , stellar age and metallicity , instead of using a constant metallicity and average main sequence spectrum template . except for the mass range of the imf which has already been fixed in the simulation ,",
    "there are no other free parameters in the calculation of the emissivity .    by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon in collapsed objects , @xmath206 , in the simulation and the ionizing photon rate @xmath207 deduced from observationally constrained reionization models",
    ", we obtained the evolution history of the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath78 .",
    "we find @xmath208 at @xmath209 , decreasing to @xmath6 at @xmath210 . this escape fraction is used to renormalize the nebular emission of pop iii and pop ii stars in the emissivity .",
    "pop iii stars are unlikely to be responsible for the observed nirb residual , and their contribution is very small , making up @xmath211% of the total absolute flux in our calculation .",
    "this is the natural result of the much lower star formation rate of pop iii stars compared with pop ii stars in the simulation , since even metals from a single pop iii star could enrich above the critical metallicity a large amount of gas around it @xcite .",
    "the formation of pop iii stars is regulated by such a chemical feedback mechanism , which limits their contribution to the nirb .",
    "however , a rapid pop iii - pop ii transition brings also a little advantage in terms of integrated emissivity , due to the longer lifetime of pop ii stars @xcite .",
    "we predict that in the wavelength range @xmath8 , the nirb flux from @xmath3 galaxies ( and their pop iii stars ) is @xmath212 , while the fluctuation strength is about @xmath11 at @xmath10 .",
    "if we remove galaxies down to @xmath165 , the above flux level is only slightly reduced ; however , by comparing with @xcite , we find that the flux from @xmath174 dramatically decreases and the remaining becomes comparable to the predicted signal of @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "this implies that in principle it is possible to get the signal from reionization sources by subtracting galaxies down to a certain magnitude .    the relative fluctuation amplitude , @xmath195 , at @xmath10 is @xmath213 , almost independent of the wavelength",
    ". this ratio may be helpful to investigate the clustering features of the sources contribute to the nirb , since the intrinsic properties of galaxies almost cancel out . despite the difficulties in measuring the absolute flux accurately ,",
    "it could be treated as a quality indicator in the data reduction process : if a much higher / lower ratio is obtained from the data , this might suggest that a more careful analysis work is required to extract the genuine contribution from reionization sources .    in spite of being accurate and consistent with the observed lfs and reionization data , thus offering a robust prediction of the nirb contribution from high-@xmath2 galaxies which likely reionized the universe ,",
    "a puzzling question remains : the predicted fluctuations are considerably lower than the observed values , indicating that in addition to the contribution from the expected high-@xmath2 galaxy population ( and pop iii stars ) , we should invoke some other  yet unknown  missing component(s ) or foreground(s ) which dominates the currently observed source - subtracted nirb .",
    "moreover , the angular clustering of this missing component must be very similar to that of the high redshift galaxies and extends to degree scales .",
    "obviously , this component / foreground must be identified and removed before we are ready to exploit the nirb to study reionization sources . on the other hand , sources located at @xmath114",
    "provide about 90% of the flux from all sources with @xmath3 in our simulation ; most of them are the faint galaxies currently undetected by deep surveys . thus ,",
    "if the above mentioned additional spurious sources / foregrounds can be removed reliably , the nirb will become the primary tool to investigate the properties of the reionizing sources .",
