    "the equations of motion for a spinning test particle in a given gravitational background were deduced by mathisson and papapetrou @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath0 be the timelike unit tangent vector of the `` center of mass line '' used to make the multipole reduction , these equations are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total four - momentum of the particle and @xmath3 is a ( antisymmetric ) spin tensor , both fields defined only along the center of mass world line , for which @xmath4 is a proper time parameter .",
    "these equations evolve @xmath5 and @xmath6 along this world line . by contracting both sides of eq .",
    "( [ papcoreqs2 ] ) with @xmath7 , one obtains the following expression for the total 4-momentum @xmath8 where @xmath9 reduces to the ordinary mass in the case in which the particle is not spinning , and @xmath10 is a vector orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "the assumption that the particle under consideration is a test particle means that both its mass as well as its spin must be small enough not to contribute significantly to the background metric .",
    "moreover , in order to have a closed set of equations , the above equations of motion must be completed with supplementary conditions ( sc ) , for which the standard choice is one of the following :    * corinaldesi - papapetrou @xcite conditions : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the coordinate timelike direction given by the background , * pirani @xcite conditions : @xmath13 , * tulczyjew @xcite conditions : @xmath14 .",
    "all of these are algebraic conditions on the spin tensor components",
    ".    the mathisson - papapetrou model does not give _ a priori _ restrictions on the causal character of @xmath0 and @xmath5 and there is no agreement in the literature on how this point should be considered @xcite .",
    "when both @xmath0 and @xmath5 are timelike vectors like @xmath12 , each of the above scs simply state that the spin tensor is purely spatial with respect to the associated direction in time , or equivalently that the spin vector defined by duality lies in the corresponding local rest space .",
    "only solutions of the combined equations for which both @xmath0 and @xmath5 are timelike vectors are considered in the present paper in order to have a meaningful interpretation describing a spinning test particle with nonzero rest mass and physical momentum ; furthermore , only the pirani and tulczyjew supplementary conditions are discussed , ignoring the unnatural corinaldesi - papapetrou condition .",
    "we study the behavior of nonzero rest mass spinning test particles moving along circular orbits in the kerr spacetime in the case in which the components of the spin tensor are allowed to vary along the orbit , generalizing some previous work @xcite .",
    "our present analysis makes use of the invariant spacetime frenet - serret frame approach , which is especially useful for the description of this family of orbits .",
    "the frenet - serret formalism reflects only the geometrical properties of spacetime and of the worldline , being defined in an invariant manner without reference to any particular coordinate system or observer .",
    "iyer and vishveshwara @xcite have introduced the rather involved computational formulas necessary for explicit evaluation of the frenet - serret frame @xmath15 , @xmath16 and its associated curvature @xmath17 and torsions @xmath18 @xcite for arbitrary constant speed circular orbits in general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "the problem is thus addressed within a more elegant framework with respect to the treatment developed in the companion paper @xcite concerning the special case of a schwarzschild black hole . as a consequence , even though details are naturally more involved , results are actually more meaningful , all quantities being expressed in terms of the frenet - serret curvature and torsions .",
    "the restriction to circular motion is a very strong limitation for the system . in fact",
    ", the effect of time varying spin on the acceleration of the test particle path will break the symmetry of that path unless the spin precession is very closely tied to the natural frenet - serret rotational properties of the path itself .",
    "we find that as in the nonrotating case , only the pirani supplementary conditions permit such specialized solutions in the rotating case of a kerr black hole since they allow the spin tensor to be described completely by a spatial vector with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "thus the spacetime rotation does not substantially change the features of the circular motion of spinning particles compared to the static case . abandoning the restriction to circular motion leads in general to non - periodic motion , a feature that seems to characterize the general situation in the schwarzschild @xcite as well as kerr @xcite spacetimes .    in what follows",
