    "calculated in lowest order in @xmath64 , each element of the tensor @xmath158 can be expressed by terms of the form : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are either @xmath162 or @xmath163 . in this notation ,",
    "the algebraic expression for @xmath157 is : @xmath164 where , within this appendix , we allow for an arbitrary spin degeneracy @xmath165 . since @xmath154 the imaginary part of the last row vanishes , however this is not the case for the real part , which causes the level renormalization .",

    "such a pseudo spin representation is often used in the quantum information community.@xcite with this change of variables , the dynamics of the double dot system can be mapped on the motion of a spin in an external magnetic field .",
    "this is in close analogy to the dynamics of a quantum dot connected to ferromagnetic leads.@xcite    due to the serial geometry the external tunneling affects only the z - direction of the pseudo spin and the left and right contacts couple with a different sign to @xmath197 .",

    "the interdot tunneling characterized by @xmath43 leads to a precession of the isospin around the x - axes , while the energy separation between the dot levels results in a rotation around the z - axes .",
    "it is important to note that the renormalized level separation between the dots changes due to the external coupling and it is not given by the bare level separation @xmath46 .    in the following we outline the close analogy between the transport through a serial double dot described here and the dynamics in a spin valve described in ref .  .",
