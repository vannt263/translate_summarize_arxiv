    "the linearity of the hubble law over large scales , as illustrated by the early work of sandage & hardy ( 1973 ) , has been confirmed by more recent measurements as discussed by postman ( 1997 ) .",
    "these measurements do not however exclude the possibility of local deviations from hubble flow with amplitudes on the order of a few percent , as would be produced by large ",
    "scale mass fluctuations .",
    "for example , an extended , underdense region centered on the local group would exhibit a locally accelerated hubble flow .",
    "this could , to a point , help reconcile discrepant estimates of the value of the hubble constant obtained by methods which sample vastly different scales and solve the still raspy conflict between some estimates of the age of a matter dominated universe and that of the oldest stars . by analyzing the monopole of the peculiar velocity field as described by a sample of 44 type ia supernovae ( sn ) ,",
    "zehavi ( 1998 , hereafter z98 ) have recently suggested that the local group may be near the center of a bubble of 70@xmath0 mpc radius ( where @xmath7 is the hubble constant ) , underdense by 20% , which may be itself surrounded by an overdense shell .",
    "the isotropic flow observed within that `` bubble '' would then exceed the universal rate by @xmath8% ; i.e. , studies that rely on distance indicators contained within that bubble would overestimate the hubble constant by 6.5% .",
    "z98 cautiously underscore the marginal character of their detection , as well as the need to corroborate , or refute , their suggestion by means of tests with independent sets of data . in this _",
    ", we provide such a test .",
    "based on data published earlier ( giovanelli 1997a , b ; hereafter g97a and g97b ) , peculiar velocities of 24 clusters of galaxies within 90@xmath0 mpc , obtained from measurements for 782 galaxies in their fields ( hereafter referred to as sci ) have been recently presented by giovanelli ( 1998a ) , who also used it to compuete a dipole and investigate the z98 claim . because of the limited depth of the sci sample , their test of the z98 claim was inconclusive .",
    "recently , we have completed a deeper survey of cluster peculiar velocities , which extends to 200@xmath0 mpc . as for the sci sample",
    ", the new survey is based on the tully  fisher ( 1977 ; hereafter tf ) technique .",
    "the first installments of this data set are in dale ( 1997 , 1998 ) ; the final one is in preparation , but in preliminary form its results can be seen in dale ( 1998 ) .",
    "the new survey , which we shall refer to as scii , includes 522 galaxies in 52 clusters .",
    "the dipole signature of the scii , which is consistent with that of the cmb temperature dipole , is discussed in dale ( 1999 ) .",
    "the combination of sci and scii provides a peculiar velocity data set of slightly smaller depth , but higher sampling density than the sn sample of z98 .",
    "the peculiar velocity errors of the sci set vary between 3% and 6% of the distance , for each individual cluster . in the case of the scii set , peculiar velocity errors are somewhat higher , due to the smaller number of galaxies observed per cluster : they hover between 4% and 9% , except in a few cases which will be discussed later . on the average ,",
    "the accuracy of each cluster peculiar velocity compares favorably with the quoted uncertainty of 58% ( for the internal errors alone ) of the distance of individual sn in the z98 sample . since the 76 clusters in the sci+scii merged sample straddle quite comfortably the boundaries of the z98 bubble",
    ", they can provide tighter constraints than the sn sample on the amplitude of the proposed , locally underdense region .",
    "table 1 lists the clusters in the sci+scii merged sample , identified either by their abell number ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) or by their common name , the adopted center coordinates , as well as the radial velocity @xmath9 and the peculiar velocity @xmath10 in the cmb reference frame , ( after giovanelli 1998a and dale 1998 ) and the number @xmath11 of galaxies in each cluster with tf measurements .",
    "we compute a distance @xmath12 and a deviation from hubble flow @xmath13 .",
    "the total error on the peculiar velocity of each cluster , as listed in table 1 , includes several components , arising from : ( i ) photometric and spectroscopic observational errors ; ( ii ) uncertainties in the corrections applied to observed parameters ; ( iii ) uncertainties in the cluster redshifts ; ( iv ) the scatter in the tf relation ; ( v ) uncertainties in the tf template relation slope and zero point , especially that deriving from the assumed standard of rest .",
    "we discuss point ( v ) in greater detail in the next section .",
    "the other sources of error are extensively discussed in the data papers mentioned above .",
    "tf peculiar velocities are derived as offsets from a template relation , which in its simplest form is defined by two parameters : a slope and a zero point .",
    "errors on both the zero point and on the slope translate into spurious , geocentric peculiar velocity fields . for example",
    ", an error of 0.05 mag in the zero point would simulate a slowdown or speeding up of the hubble expansion by 2.3% .",
    "as for the effect of an error on the tf slope : if the template relation is , for example , too steep  i.e. for a given velocity width which is broader than some fiducial value the template predicts too bright a magnitude  , then high width galaxies will preferentially yield positive magnitude offsets .",
    "the opposite will be true for low width galaxies .",
    "since low width galaxies are intrinsically faint , they are more likely to be present in nearby samples than in more distant ones ; thus nearby samples fitted with too steep a tf template relation exhibit a net negative magnitude offset , which translates into a spurious outflow . the effect of unrecognized tf calibration errors can then be misconstrued as a monopole perturbation , and thus as a geocentric hubble flow distortion .",
    "the tf template relation is determined _ internally _ for a cluster sample . in the case of sci ,",
    "it was obtained by assuming that the subset of clusters farther than 40@xmath0 mpc has a globally null monopole ( g97b ) . dale ( 1998 )",
    "obtained an scii template by assuming that the set of clusters has a globally null monopole , and adopting the same tf slope as for the sci sample .",
    "as discussed in g97b , given a number @xmath11 of clusters the uncertainty on the tf zero point of the resulting template can not be depressed indefinitely by increasing the average number @xmath14 of galaxies observed per cluster , and taking advantage of the @xmath15 statistical reduction of noise on the mean . that is because a `` kinematical '' or `` thermal '' component of the uncertainty depends on the number @xmath11 , distribution in the sky and peculiar velocity distribution function of the clusters used . in sci , for example , the statistical uncertainty deriving from the total number of galaxies observed ( @xmath16 ) is exceeded by the kinematic uncertainty , which is quantified as follows . for a sample of @xmath11 clusters of average redshift @xmath17 ,",
    "the most probable systematic error on the template relation zero point is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( expressed in the same units as @xmath20 ) is the line of sight r.m.s .",
    "cluster peculiar velocity , of about 300  ( g97b ; giovanelli 1998a ; dale 1998 ) .",
    "this quantity is about 0.04 mag for sci , while it is only 0.01 mag for scii due to the larger mean distance and number of clusters of the latter . since the total number of galaxies involved in the two samples is comparable , the zero point of the scii template is thus more accurate than that of sci . on the other hand ,",
    "the peculiar velocities of individual clusters in scii are less accurate than those in sci .",
    "we note that the kinematical or thermal component of the uncertainty is larger for sn peculiar velocities than for our cluster ones .",
    "that is because the amplitude of the distribution function of peculiar velocities among individual galaxies  the hosts of sn  is larger than that of clusters , as the former is amplified by the variance associated with fluctuations on small scales .    in the case of both sci and scii ,",
    "a direct tf template relation was obtained , using the approach described in g97b .",
    "the data for each cluster offset was corrected for the effect of an incompleteness bias .",
    "the zero points of the two templates were found to agree to within 0.015 mag ( scii being fainter by that amount ) .    in this paper , we combine the sci and scii samples , and use them to investigate the presence of large scale variations in the monopole of the hubble flow .",
    "note that such combined sample can not be used for the detection of a geocentric deviation from smooth hubble flow_which would extend over the full volume sampled by the total cluster set , as it would be null by design_. the merged cluster data set can however be used to detect _ changes in _",
    "@xmath21 that would take place well within the volume spanned by the data .",
    "the amplitude of the change ( say a step in @xmath21 ) that can be detected depends on the location of the presumed step and on the accuracy with which the match in the tf zero point between the sci and scii samples is established :    \\(i ) for our cluster sample , a step would be ideally situated between 70@xmath0 and 110@xmath0 mpc , in order to maximize the chance of detection , because it would split the cluster sample into two roughly equal parts .",
    "the sci+scii sample is thus well - suited to test the z98 result .",
    "\\(ii ) the internal accuracy of the zero point for the sci sample is 0.025 mag ; however , since it is based on a subset of 14 clusters farther than 40@xmath0 mpc , the kinematical uncertainty of 0.04 mag , as mentioned above , increases the total uncertainty to 0.045 mag . the total uncertainty on the zero point of scii , because it involves a larger number of more distant clusters , is only 0.025 mag ; the kinematical component in this case is only 0.01 mag . note for comparison that a 6.5% step in @xmath21 would translate in a 0.13 mag differential tf offset between clusters on each side of the step .",
    "it is also useful to point out that each of the two samples was completed over many observing runs , both in their photometric and spectroscopic parts , and a number of objects were observed in more than one run .",
    "mismatches in the cross  run and cross ",
    "cluster calibrations thus have been minimized and their impact on the final error budget is included in the statistical estimate given above .",
    "\\(iii ) the small overlap in distance between sci and scii occurs near 70@xmath0 mpc , which is the edge of the hubble bubble suggested by z98 ( 4 clusters in sci are farther than @xmath22 , while 4 in scii are within that redshift ) .",
    "we thus need to establish the impact of the accuracy of the match between the two samples zero points , on the estimation of the likelihood of a hubble bubble .",
    "we return to this point in section 4.1 .",
    "using the data in table 1 , and forcing the template tf zero point to be the same for sci and scii , we obtain figure 1 , a plot of the hubble deviation versus the distance . in the upper panel of figure 1",
    "we display the individual data points , while in the lower one we show the errors associated with each measurement . starred symbols refer to the sci sample , while circular symbols refer to scii .",
    "eight clusters , flagged by double daggers in table 1 , are plotted in figure 1 as unfilled symbols : their peculiar velocities have been obtained from fewer than five tf measurements and are thus very unreliable .",
    "the latter are not used in the following statistical analyses .",
    "the plot presented in figure 1 is similar to that in figure 1 of z98 . for comparison",
    ", we have included the outline of the z98 step as a dashed line , which extends from zero to 70@xmath0 mpc distance , at the level of @xmath23 .",
    "we note immediately that the z98 proposal of a hubble bubble is not corroborated by the cluster data .",
    "we also note that at distances nearer than @xmath24 mpc even modest peculiar velocities constitute a sizable fraction of @xmath20 , thus amplifying and distorting the values of @xmath21 . the implied deviation from hubble flow",
    "they reveal is of scarce interest , as they apply to too small , too sparsely sampled a volume .",
    "next , we test for the presence of a step at 70@xmath0 mpc distance , of the kind suggested by z98 , and we search for the signature of other possible , geocentric large  scale fluctuations in the hubble flow .",
    "we consider whether a step is present in @xmath21 at 70@xmath0 mpc , by taking the difference in the average of @xmath21 between @xmath25 and @xmath26 mpc , and the corresponding average at distances higher than @xmath26 mpc .",
    "that difference is @xmath27 , if individual clusters are weighed by their errors in @xmath21 , and @xmath28 if equal weight averages are computed .",
    "the uncertainty of this result can however be affected by a number of systematic errrors , which exceed the statistical estimate given above ; in the following we discuss them one by one .",
    "_ kinematic zero point mismatch : _ first , we consider the impact of the systematic mismatch between the tf template zero points of the two samples , as discussed in part ( iii ) of section 3 .",
    "we can evaluate the impact of that uncertainty on the determination of the amplitude of a possible step at @xmath26 mpc by offsetting by @xmath29 mag the sci and scii samples with respect to each other , computing in each case the amplitude of the step ( note that there are sci and scii clusters on both sides of the step ) .",
    "the results are respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 mag .",
    "it can thus be inferred that the impact on the uncertainty of the step , produced by a possible systematic error in the match between zero points for the two samples , is about 0.03 mag or 1.5% .",
    "_ differential malmquist bias : _ malmquist bias corrections have not been applied to the cluster peculiar velocities .",
    "if such a correction were the same for all the clusters , it would have no impact on the detectability of a hubble bubble step .",
    "however , since the more distant clusters of scii each include a smaller number of galaxies with tf measurements , the impact of a possible differential malmquist bias between sci and scii needs to be explored . as discussed in giovanelli ( 1998a ) , the malmquist bias can be estimated with adequate accuracy in the `` homogeneous '' assumption , i.e. that the clusters distribution in space is poissonian , and shown to be quite small .",
    "the malmquist bias correction in that case is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the scatter in magnitudes about the tf relation ( about 0.35 mag ) and @xmath35 the number of galaxies with tf measurements per cluster .",
    "for example , for a cluster with 10 galaxies with tf measurements , the average for scii , the malmquist bias correction is 1.0% on the distance . in the case of sci",
    ", the average number of galaxies with tf measurements per cluster is about 16 . in that case",
    "the malmquist bias correction is 0.7% on the distance .",
    "neglect to apply a malmquist bias correction thus introduces a possible bias with an amplitude of 0.003 in @xmath21 .",
    "_ template relation slope : _ the same template relation slope has been used for both sci and scii , as discussed in dale ( 1998 ) .",
    "the error on the determination of that slope is given in g97b , as 0.12 on a slope of -7.68 , or 1.6% .",
    "if there were a sgnificant difference in the distribution of galaxies as a function of velocity width , between nearby and more distant clusters , the uncertainty on the slope would introduce a systematic bias in the distances . to estimate the amplitude of that bias ,",
    "we binned galaxies as a function of width , separately for the clusters within and beyond 70@xmath0 mpc , and for each group estimated the average magnitude offset introduced by an error in the slope of 1.6% ; in doing so , we assumed that the zero point , i.e. the value of the template relation at @xmath36 , is correct .",
    "the resulting tf offset uncertainty between the two groups is 0.0055 mag , or 0.0025 on the distance .",
    "_ evolution : _ some authors ( rix 1997 ; simard & pritchet 1998 ) have claimed substantial evolution in the mass  to  light ratio of spiral galaxies between @xmath37 and relatively modest redshifts @xmath38 , while others ( vogt 1997 ; bershady 1996 ; dale , us ' on & giovanelli 1999 , in preparation ) find no such effect .",
    "evolution would translate into a shift of the tf relation zero point .",
    "while this issue is still quite uncertain , we can estimate the possible impact of evolution , assuming a ( rather generous ) shift of 1 mag between @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "the difference in @xmath40 between the clusters within 70@xmath0 mpc and those farther away is @xmath41 , thus a possible shift of 0.02 mag or 0.01 in distance would be possible .",
    "the direction of this relative shift would be that of a gradual brightening of the higher redshift galaxies and therefore increasing their average @xmath21 . probably overestimating it , we conclude that the uncertainty associated with this effect is 0.01 in the distance .",
    "below , we give a summary of the components of uncertainty with which the sci+scii merged sample can be used to identify a possible step in the hubble flow at 70@xmath0 mpc :    0.3 in    [ cols= \" < , < , > , > \" , ]     thus our estimate of the amplitude and significance of a step in the hubble flow at 70@xmath0 mpc is = 0.0100.022    for a two  zone model , which includes an inner void out to 70@xmath42 mpc and an outer region expanding at the hubble rate , z98 report an amplitude of @xmath43 ; such a void is not apparent in our data , in which a 6.5% step would be a 3@xmath44 event .",
    "we remark however that , compounding our estimated error with that reported in z98 , the difference between the two results is @xmath45 .",
    "the hubble distortion reported by z98 reduces to @xmath46 in a three  zone model , where an inner underdense sphere of 70@xmath0 mpc is surrounded by an overdense shell between 70 and 105 @xmath0 mpc ; for the outer shell , z98 report an inflow of @xmath47 . for the latter region , between 70 and 105 @xmath0 mpc , our data yields @xmath48 .",
    "the difference between our and the z98 results , compounding the reported errors , is @xmath49 .",
    "we search for the signature of other possible large  scale fluctuations in the hubble flow , adopting a similar @xmath50 minimization analysis to that carried out by z98 .",
    "the minimization of ^2 = _ i ^2/_i , where @xmath51 are the values plotted in figure 1 and @xmath52 is a model with a constant departure from zero in @xmath53 between two arbitrary distances @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is equivalent to that expressed in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) of z98 .",
    "@xmath56 is the estimated error on @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the strongest signature for a departure from hubble flow consistent with the sci+scii cluster data is a ( very marginal ) step of amplitude @xmath3 centered at @xmath4 mpc and 33 mpc wide .",
    "the boundaries of the region are very `` soft '' . in the calculations",
    ", we impose that the width of the perturbed region should be no less than 20 mpc , including only 61 clusters with @xmath58 between 30 and 200 mpc and excluding the eight clusters with poor sampling ( @xmath59 ) plotted as unfilled symbols in figure 1 and flagged in table 1 .",
    "z98 have cogently argued that a region of @xmath60 mpc radius could be underdense by @xmath1%  which is the amount necessary to produce a suggested local acceleration of 6.5% of the hubble flow  , without unreasonably stretching the plausible amplitude range of cosmological density fluctuations .",
    "one would be left , of course , with the nagging coincidence of the nearly central location of the lg in the void ( a circumstance which would also be at some odds with the fairly large peculiar velocity of the lg of some 620 , as indicated by the cmb dipole ) .",
    "our data give an amplitude for a possible hubble flow distortion within 70 @xmath0 mpc of @xmath61 .",
    "the results of this paper are consistent with those on the peculiar velocity field as traced by the sfi sample of field spirals : its dipole converges to that of the cmb dipole , both in amplitude and apex direction , within about @xmath65 mpc ( giovanelli 1998b ) .",
    "we conclude that , at distances in excess of @xmath5 mpc , the cluster peculiar velocity data are consistent with a picture in which the average hubble flow is remarkably smooth .",
    "the comments of an anonymous referee helped improve the presentation of this paper .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on observations carried out at the arecibo observatory , which is part of the national astronomy and ionosphere center ( naic ) , at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) and at the palomar observatory ( po ) , naic is operated by cornell university , kpno and ctio by associated universities for research in astronomy , all under cooperative agreements with the national science foundation .",
