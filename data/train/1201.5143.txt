    "the goal of this work is to examine the solvability of the dirac equation , when reduced to one spatial dimension .",
    "the key point is of course that the analysis is easier and deeper for an ordinary differential equation , and also that the reduction itself can be achieved by many means , such as separating the radial from the angular part , or neglecting two directions in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "a natural source of the potential is the magnetic field , which also provides a direct connection with systems of quantum optics and a possible experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation form is also encountered when dealing with the supersymmetric schrdinger equation @xcite , to which all results on integrability can be transferred .",
    "of course , one has to keep track of the different definitions of potentials and physical interpretation , but the mathematical structure remains the same , and that is the main interest of the present letter .",
    "a great many of known solutions were obtained for the scale invariant potentials , and can be found in @xcite . however",
    ", such approach relies on the assumption of a particular symmetry and is not exhaustive .",
    "not disregarding it , it seems natural to also consider equations like this ( i.e. second order and linear ) on grounds of the differential galois group theory . mostly because it provides rigorous tools for finding the exact forms of solutions and also because it strictly rules out unsolvable cases",
    " exactly like the `` ordinary '' galois theory for polynomials .",
    "since linear equations often present themselves as central , like the schrdinger equation or the density perturbation in cosmology , they have already been successfully studied with these methods , e.g. in @xcite . when it comes to the dirac equation ,",
    "the complete analysis in the case of general polynomial potentials was carried out in a previous work by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "this class happened to be very restrictive , and only one non - trivial case ",
    "the so - called dirac oscillator  is explicitly integrable .",
    "the next obvious step seems to be the wider class of rational functions which is undertaken here .",
    "this turns out to be too wide to be treated as completely as polynomials , the basic reason being that it is the poles of the equation s coefficients that matter , and polynomials have just one  at infinity .",
    "as will be shown , even the simplest potential with just one pole and linear polynomial part can not be analyzed explicitly in that it requires recursion to formulate integrability conditions .",
    "this is a typical feature of the heun equation and its generalizations , and thus a generic rational potential is beyond explicit classification which was possible for polynomial ones .",
    "fortunately , the recursive conditions can be studied to some extent with regard to the real values of the parameters , and shed some light on the number of admissible physical cases .",
    "the analogy with polynomials also motivates the study of potentials which give rise to similar behavior of the equation s singular points and since direct analysis is impossible , one might also try the inverse problem .",
    "thus , additionally , two other scenarios are considered here : rational potentials which produce only the irregular singularity at infinity , and the whittaker equation , whose solvability is known and can be used to obtain a new , two - parameter family of integrable potentials .",
    "to be more specific , let us consider the same setup as in @xcite , so that the time - independent dirac equation in one dimension @xmath0 is @xmath1 which gives the second order equations for each spinorial component @xmath2 where the dirac matrices were taken to be @xmath3 and the potential @xmath4 was introduced in the so - called scalar coupling , so that it is added to the mass term @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    "@xmath6 will henceforth denote the effective mass thus obtained , that is the old mass plus the constant term of @xmath4 .",
    "the other , vector , coupling is equivalent , as shown in @xcite , so that essentially the equation in question is just @xmath7    the question of exact solutions of such an equation with a rational coefficient @xmath8 is best expressed in terms of field extensions of @xmath9 .",
    "an extension including all the elementary functions , direct integration and some special transcendental functions is the generalized liouvillian extension .",
    "it consists of a finite chain of differential function fields , @xmath10 such that each new field @xmath11 is obtained from the previous @xmath12 by adjoining an element @xmath13 which satisfies one of the three following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 is algebraic over @xmath12 , 2 .",
    "@xmath13 is primitive , i.e. @xmath14 , 3 .",
    "@xmath13 is the solution of @xmath15 , for some @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "these fields are differential fields precisely so that there is some notion of the derivative @xmath18 , although here it is simply the differentiation with regard to @xmath0 and the starting field @xmath19 is just @xmath9 .",
    "if the solution of a given equation belongs to @xmath20 we might call it a liouvillian solution and it is explicitly expressible by finite number of elementary operations like integrals , exponentials or solving algebraic equations . in other words ,",
    "the equation in question is solvable / integrable if it has liouvillian solutions .",
    "a more detailed exposition of the above can be found in @xcite , and here it should be added that this particular notion of exact solution is intimately connected with the underlying group theory .",
    "namely , one defines the differential galois group of a differential equation as the group of automorphisms of the field to which the solutions belong , such that their action on the base field @xmath19 is trivial .",
    "intuitively it means that the group permutes the solutions , but does not change the equation s coefficients .",
    "it then follows that the equation is solvable when the group is solvable . in case of the second order equations like",
    "the group is an algebraic subgroup of @xmath21 , and there exists an algorithm contrived by kovacic @xcite for deciding on its integrability and finding the solutions ( for another form of the algorithm see @xcite ) .",
    "also , most of the common equations of mathematical physics have been completely analyzed in this regard ( see e.g. the monograph @xcite for a collection of results ) , so the question is often that of finding a connection with what is already known .",
    "this will be the main route taken here , allowing to uncover a new , wide class of integrable potentials .",
    "a naive generalization of the results of @xcite is difficult for the following reason . when @xmath4 is polynomial , it only has one pole at infinity ( and so has @xmath22 ) , and it just the laurent expansion with finitely many terms .",
    "the polynomial s coefficients are then all we need for the analysis .",
    "a rational @xmath4 can be defined by a quotient of two polynomials , and although the denominator still has finitely many coefficients , they are not used directly .",
    "it is the poles that matter so @xmath22 needs to be expanded around each one .",
    "one is therefore left with an arbitrary number of poles of arbitrary orders and coefficients with which to construct a general rational potential that could be analyzed effectively with kovacic s algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , even the seemingly simplest case of adding just one pole to an integrable polynomial potential leads to only implicit integrability relations , so a full classification analogous to the polynomial case is impossible . to see this",
    "let us consider the following @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "in general this yields the ( biconfluent ) heun differential equation whose solvability is determined by algebraic relations defined only recursively  the subject of this section .",
    "explicit analysis is possible whenever one of the other parameters is zero , and the equation reduces to a special case of the confluent hypergeometric one , which has countable families of liouvillian solutions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath25 eq . becomes a special case of the whittaker equation , analyzed in detail in the next section .",
    "when @xmath26 but @xmath27 it reduces to the laguerre equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 the solutions are the laguerre functions @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and these are again expressible by confluent hypergeometric functions . they are liouvillian if at least one of @xmath32 or @xmath33 is an integer ( with one solution polynomial for positive integer @xmath32 ) .",
    "additionally , @xmath34 always leads to an explicit solution of @xmath35 regardless of the form of the potential .",
    "the generic case with all parameters non - zero can be slightly simplified with taking @xmath36 or , in other words , rescaling as follows @xmath37 the reason for using absolute value is to keep the physical quantities real .",
    "this will make identifying the physical integrable cases easier .    turning",
    "now to kovacic s algorithm , the first case will be the only one to possible hold , and the solution must be of the form @xmath38 with rational @xmath39 and polynomial @xmath40 . denoting @xmath41 and substituting into we have @xmath42",
    "so that the poles of @xmath4 and @xmath43 must agree except that there could be additional simple poles of @xmath43 with residue 1 not appearing in @xmath4 . since @xmath44 , the first term is needed precisely to account for those poles , and @xmath39 has to have the same polynomial part as @xmath4 ( up to a sign ) so that the expansions at infinity agree .",
    "finally , the pole @xmath45 requires that @xmath39 includes either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , so that there are four possibilities all in all : @xmath47    the next step is to substitute the above into the equation in question and look for polynomial solutions for @xmath40 with its degree @xmath48 determined by the highest order term in each respective equation .",
    "the four subcases are thus @xmath49 taking @xmath50 the above can be stated as recurrence relations @xmath51 with common initial conditions of @xmath52 they reflect the fact that @xmath40 can always be taken to be a monic polynomial , and its degree is exactly @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , the relations hold for @xmath53 and one can successively generate @xmath54 , as functions of the parameters , down to @xmath55 .",
    "the last but one relation , i.e. for @xmath56 gives us @xmath55 but there is one more with @xmath57 and only two terms @xmath58 and @xmath55 since for polynomials @xmath59 .",
    "this is the required condition for the existence of polynomial @xmath40 .",
    "it is convenient , however , to consider the last relation as the definition of @xmath60 , which will be a function of @xmath6 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath48 , and then the condition @xmath63 ( equivalent to the two - term relation between @xmath58 and @xmath55 ) will yield the admissible values of parameters for which a polynomial @xmath40 exists , and hence the main equation is solvable . since the whole problem is considered over the complex domain ,",
    "all polynomials have the maximal number of roots , counting with multiplicities . when considered as polynomials in @xmath6",
    ", @xmath60 is of degree @xmath64 provided that the middle term of the recurrence does not vanish",
    ". this particular way that @xmath6 enters also means that all the polynomials are either even or odd functions of @xmath6 .",
    "for each degree @xmath48 the relations implicitly define @xmath60 whose roots then provide the value of parameters leading to an integrable case , while the energy is determined by its relation with @xmath48 in each case . of course",
    ", one is mostly interested in the real values of the parameters as they correspond to the physical case .",
    "this is the reason for approaching @xmath54 as polynomials in @xmath6 and @xmath62 ( @xmath61 can be scaled away , as mentioned before ) .",
    "the particular form of the recurrence makes those sequences define orthogonal polynomials in most cases ( although this property is of no use here ) , and their zeros are then all real , simple and with the separation property @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67-th zero of the @xmath68-th polynomial . to see this in the first subcase note that @xmath69 and @xmath70 so that distinct real roots exist for @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is ruled out by @xmath73 , @xmath74 ruled out by @xmath75 , so the smallest @xmath48 is 2 , which translates to @xmath76 . assuming that the separation property holds for polynomials @xmath54 and @xmath77 the proof is by induction on @xmath78 .",
    "evaluating @xmath79 at a zero of @xmath77 gives @xmath80 where @xmath61 was taken negative , as is necessary by the energy condition in .",
    "since the zeros of @xmath54 lie only between those of @xmath77 it follows that the left - hand side of the above is non - zero and switches sign as @xmath67 increases , provided that @xmath81 is non - zero .",
    "it follows that @xmath79 must change sign in each interval @xmath82 which can happen only at a root .",
    "the only thing left to show that @xmath79 has two roots outside of @xmath83 . with the further assumption that @xmath84 the sign of @xmath79 at the last root of @xmath77 is opposite to the sign of @xmath85 but they both have the same sign in their leading powers of @xmath6 which are @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively , so that @xmath79 must have another root for the signs to agree as @xmath88 .",
    "the same happens at the lowest root . finally , care has to be taken as to the middle term of the recurrence , as it can not vanish ( the number of roots must be maximal ) .",
    "fortunately for @xmath57 the relation just states that @xmath89 so effectively we can take @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the integrability condition , and automatically the smallest @xmath48 to consider is 3 as @xmath92 implies @xmath93 .",
    "altogether this means that the induction is valid for @xmath94 , and the separation property holds up to @xmath58 .",
    "the third subcase is analogous and even simpler , with the only difference being that the energy condition requires @xmath95 , and the positivity of @xmath81 is enough to guarantee the appropriate changes of signs , and maximal degree of each @xmath54 .",
    "for the first induction step , the condition for @xmath96 to have simple real roots is that @xmath97 be positive .",
    "since @xmath72 gives @xmath98 , it follows that @xmath99 is enough for the separation property .",
    "subcases two and four differ in that the sign of @xmath61 is now arbitrary , but the general proofs are the same and we get @xmath100 , @xmath101 or @xmath102 , @xmath103 in subcase two , and @xmath100 , @xmath104 or @xmath105 , @xmath106 . where again the trivial cases @xmath27 were discarded .",
    "however , the results can be slightly strengthened here . in subcase two , for @xmath107",
    "the relation with @xmath57 just gives @xmath59 , and one can see that for @xmath108 , the induction can still be carried as before , with the modification that signs at the last step are reverted .",
    "namely @xmath109 so that for @xmath95 at the maximal root of @xmath55 the signs of @xmath60 and @xmath58 are the same , but additionally the leading coefficients differ in sign , as the coefficient multiplying @xmath110 in the relation is positive , while it was negative for all higher @xmath78 .",
    "thus the existence of the highest root follows . for @xmath105",
    "this can not be done , as the main restriction comes from the roots of @xmath96 not from the third induction step .",
    "the same is true for subcase four with @xmath111 and @xmath95 so that the region where the separation property holds can be extended to @xmath112 .",
    "the case of @xmath113 is , by the energy condition , equivalent to @xmath34 so it brings no new solutions .",
    "putting the above together , and discarding the @xmath27 case we have    the integrability condition @xmath63 , considered as an equation in @xmath6 has the full number of single real roots in the subcases for    1 .",

    "next , the inspection of the @xmath27 case tells us that for odd @xmath126 the conditions read @xmath127 so that there are always @xmath128 real simple roots .",
    "this happens because the recurrence involves only two terms then , and we start with @xmath129 reducing the index by 2 at each iteration to get to @xmath60 .",
    "it then follows that in some neighborhood of @xmath27 there must still be @xmath32 real simple roots , because @xmath60 is a polynomial in @xmath62 whose coefficients are again polynomials of @xmath6 , so that the roots must be continuous functions of @xmath6 .",

    "let us first consider how to generalize the basic form of the equation in question .",
    "we want our main equation to assume some particular , prescribed form with rational @xmath22 , and notice immediately that energy enters in such a way that the infinity must be an irregular singular point .",
    "this could in principle be remedied by other parameters of @xmath4 , but only for one fixed value of @xmath155 , while the physical nature of the problem allows any @xmath156 to begin with ( and usually and with a restricted , but still infinite spectrum ) .",

    "one might ask whether there are rational potentials with the property that only the infinity is a singular point  like in the polynomial case .",
    "@xmath157 would then need at least one pole , not to be polynomial , and it could only be of first order and residue 1 if @xmath158 is to have no poles . the general potential would then be @xmath159 with a polynomial @xmath160 , and @xmath22 reads @xmath161 the only possibility of removing the poles is cancellation between the two sums , and expanding them at each @xmath162 the condition is @xmath163 the poles are all different ( otherwise the residue would not be 1 ) , so that this system of @xmath164 equations determines a polynomial of degree @xmath165 uniquely , but any other polynomial which vanishes at the poles can be added , so the most general form of @xmath166 is @xmath167 where @xmath168 satisfies and @xmath169 is arbitrary .",

    "its general form is the whittaker equation : @xmath185 and since its solvability conditions are known , we can find out which potentials allow liouvillian solutions .    in order for the dirac equation to assume such form",
    ", the potential has to satisfy @xmath186 which is a riccati equation .",
    "its rational solution can be obtained by the analysis of the poles of the right - hand side .",

    "similarly , the lowest order terms require that @xmath196 and since we excluded zero from the list of the roots @xmath197 also must vanish .",

    "for example , in the @xmath208 region , one would not take the function @xmath207 since it behaves as @xmath209 asymptotically , while @xmath210 behaves as @xmath211 .    here",
    ", however , we are interested in the general nature of the involved functions , rather than particular physical model , so we wish to impose other restrictions , namely the liouvillian character of the solutions . for the whittaker equation",
    "the conditions for that are well known @xcite and here they give @xmath212 which , upon substitution , leads to @xmath213 in other words , when the potential is such that @xmath214 the solutions are always liouvillian , and otherwise the parameters must satisfy @xmath215 which in turn means that the integrable part of the spectrum is bounded by @xmath216 note that when @xmath62 is an integer itself , the case of @xmath217 is excluded by @xmath75 .    for the particular case of @xmath218 , eq . is effectively the bessel equation @xmath219 when the variables are changed according to @xmath220 so , assuming @xmath221 , the solutions are given in term of the bessel functions @xmath222 and these are known to be liouvillian only if their order , i.e. @xmath223 , is half of an odd integer .",
    "finally , for @xmath224 ( and @xmath218 ) , eq .",
    "is solvable by elementary functions of @xmath225",
    "to put the results together , we have shown that the one - dimensional dirac equation with a rational potential will lead to integrability conditions which in general will be given by polynomials defined recursively . also , that rational potentials can be determined if some natural conditions are required of the resulting equation itself .",
    "the direct and inverse results are as follows .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath226 gives rise to the biconfluent heun equation ( if none of the parameters is zero ) .",
    "its solvability is determined by the polynomial condition @xmath227 , obtained by one of the relations ( together with the respective conditions on @xmath156 , @xmath61 and @xmath48 given by )  if any of the four can be solved it gives a liouvillian solution .",
    "however , we are only interested in real values of the parameters and the three theorems [ th1 ] , [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] characterize ( to some extent ) the position and asymptotics of the real roots .      1 .",
    "@xmath132 , the dirac oscillator solvable by hermite functions @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 , the laguerre equation , solvable with @xmath228 , with @xmath229 . + ( these are liouvillian functions when @xmath32 or @xmath230 is an integer . ) 3 .",
    "@xmath25 , the whittaker equation of section * v * , summarized below .",
    "if we restrict the problem somewhat by requiring that @xmath22 remains a polynomial , although @xmath157 might still be rational , we obtain a general condition that the potential is of the form @xmath231 with @xmath168 of degree @xmath165 such that @xmath232 and @xmath169 and arbitrary polynomial .",
    "this is the most general rational potential that leads to a polynomial coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "due to @xmath168 being given only implicitly ( although uniquely ) only the one - pole case in analyzed in section * iv*. the potential turns out to be @xmath233 and the integrable values of the energy are @xmath234 .    finally , choosing a predetermined @xmath22 which is simpler than in the heun equation , but still has infinity as an irregular singular point and one other pole , leads to the whittaker ( confluent hypergeometric ) equation .",
    "the potential becomes @xmath235 where @xmath40 is expressed by the associated laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath48 as @xmath236 and @xmath6 is necessarily non - zero .",
    "the solutions are then given by the whittaker functions @xmath210 , and are additionally liouvillian ( can be expressed in closed form ) when        .the list of bases of solutions depending on parameters .",
    "@xmath241 denotes the whittaker function , @xmath242 and @xmath243 the bessel functions .",

    "@xmath246 $ ] signifies a liouvillian pair of solutions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,<,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should be clear from the general expression of the potential that it describes a very wide class , with an arbitrary number of singularities , thus modeling drastically different physical situations .",
    "the mathematical analysis carried out here gives the full information about the integrability and formal solutions , but it is beyond its scope to select the appropriate eigenstates and respective energies corresponding to a particular quantum system .",
    "however , just as is the case with the dirac oscillator , the integrability condition can be thought of as some quantization rule .",
    "as shown in @xcite dual rules will hold for the vector coupling upon exchanging the roles of @xmath156 and @xmath6 .",
    "either way , one can speak of some form of quasi - integrability here , since liouvillian solutions depend on values of ( at least ) two independent physical parameters , so even before taking the physical restrictions into account , we are left with at most countably many explicit solutions .    concerning the property of shape invariance , the recovered potential contains the known coulomb case ( albeit the spatial variable is then radial ) listed in @xcite .",
    "this is the only case when the property holds , so that the whole class is in fact new , and the method described can be used to uncover more solvable cases by loosening some of the initial requirements .",
    "future generalizations might include target equations with more singular ( regular or not ) points , or simply integrability conditions for given , more complex potentials ( trigonometric , meromorphic etc . ) .",
    "of course the liouvillian solutions are not the only notion of integrability , and most linear equations can be solved by means of series or numerically , but the concept of an exact solution remains as the starting point in any such approach .",
    "any further study of the properties of the system in question , especially qualitative , it greatly facilitated by working on explicit formulae , which this work hopefully provides .",
    "when the degree @xmath247 is even , @xmath60 will be an odd polynomial , so @xmath27 will make it trivially zero . also , writing the relation for even @xmath78 and taking the limit we get ( in the first subcase ) @xmath248 so that only even indexed polynomials are generated from @xmath249 , leading to @xmath55 but not @xmath60 .",
    "it is thus necessary to consider polynomials @xmath250 , which changes the relation to @xmath251 since @xmath6 does not enter the relation , the limit of @xmath130 changes only the initial polynomial @xmath252 .",
    "note that @xmath139 is defined only for odd @xmath78 and @xmath77 is the same as above , with its index even .",
    "the non - vanishing of energy forces @xmath48 to be at least 2 , by , and then @xmath253 , so there is one simple root ( albeit excluded ) .    the @xmath254 case can be dealt with inductively . first the explicit formula for the even indexed polynomials is @xmath255 since @xmath256 has only one root , and as @xmath78 decreases , there appear new simple roots at half ( negative ) integers , given by @xmath257 it follows that @xmath54 all share the first zero , and each has @xmath258 zeroes altogether .",
    "the sign of the polynomial does not change past its final zero , and can be determined from @xmath259 where the subscript in @xmath260 indicates that the maximal root depends on @xmath78 , and the reason for taking the value specifically at @xmath261 will become clear in a moment .",
    "the initial inductive step will be @xmath262 with the relation @xmath263 where @xmath264 , and the other polynomials are linear in @xmath62 but it is more instructive not to substitute them explicitly .",
    "now , at the first ( and only ) root of @xmath96 , @xmath265 , the above simply reduces to @xmath266 whereas at @xmath267 we have @xmath268 so @xmath269 by , the above translates to @xmath270 where the last equality follows from the fact , that @xmath271 is linear ( by construction ) and already changes sign once in the interval @xmath272 . consequently there is a root , and since @xmath273 is the next zero in the sequence , we know the signs of @xmath274 at the first two @xmath275 .",
    "the next step is to show that all following @xmath139 have the same signs at the @xmath276 roots of @xmath77 , in alternating sequence , and that there is an additional change of sign at the @xmath258-th root of @xmath277 .",
    "this is to extend the previous paragraph , where the signs agreed at the first root , and there was a change at the next one . for @xmath278",
    "the relation at any zero @xmath275 of @xmath77 is @xmath279 so that the signs agree because @xmath280 .",
    "thus as the signs alternate for @xmath139 they also alternate for @xmath281 indicating @xmath276 simple zeroes .",
    "note that at the first zero @xmath265 , the signs of all @xmath139 are thus @xmath282 and accordingly @xmath283 . as before we look what happens past the maximal zero at @xmath284 so that the first term of the relation is zero and @xmath285 or , in term of signs , @xmath286 because @xmath281 is a sum of polynomials of degree @xmath276 , its degree can not be higher , and the last change of sign means this is strictly the degree with all roots real and simple . with no more sign changes it also follows that @xmath287 and since that is the last root of @xmath277 the last induction step is completed .",
    "the third subcase is very similar to the first one , with positive @xmath61 this time , and the even @xmath54 characterized by @xmath290 where @xmath291 is the smallest root , whereas the greatest root is shared by all @xmath54 . for odd",
    "@xmath78 the relation reads @xmath292 and exactly as above the signs of @xmath139 and @xmath281 agree on zeroes of @xmath77 .",
    "the smallest root of @xmath77 is @xmath293 so the relation at @xmath294 gives @xmath295 we can then proceed inductively , as before , by noting that @xmath296 so that all @xmath139 are positive at the maximal root , and they alternate signs at @xmath275 , with the additional change of sign resulting from the above equation .",
    "the only trivial case to discard is @xmath72 for which @xmath297 , while for @xmath298 it follows that there exist @xmath133 real simple roots .",
    "subcase 2 differs in two ways .",
    "firstly , the sign of @xmath61 is arbitrary , but this only means that for @xmath105 the signs of subsequent @xmath139 will be opposite at zeroes of @xmath54 instead of the same . that will not change the fact that the signs alternate and account for all but one zero",
    "is where the second difference appears , for we have @xmath299 and as the relation is now @xmath300 it means that at @xmath301 we get @xmath302 so that the last zero of @xmath139 is known explicitly and it ensures the desired changes of signs at roots of the appropriate @xmath54 . since @xmath303 and @xmath304 have different roots ( and hence the sign changes accordingly ) , induction on @xmath78 yields the existence of @xmath305 roots of @xmath288 with the explicit root being @xmath132 .",
    "note that this also holds for @xmath72 where @xmath306 .",
    "finally , in subcase 4 , there is a complication due to @xmath307 , @xmath308 , so that all polynomials share a root . as mentioned before",
    ", it corresponds to the degenerate @xmath34 case .",
    "this is the greatest of the roots of @xmath54 which are @xmath309 let us consider @xmath95 for clarity ( the negative case is completely analogous ) .",
    "note that @xmath54 will be positive for @xmath62 less than the smallest zero because the leading coefficient will be @xmath310 and since the relation is @xmath311 the same will be true for @xmath139 and its smallest zero .",
    "we will see that apart from @xmath113 all the zeroes of @xmath281 lie between the zeroes of @xmath277 .",
    "direct computation shows that the smaller zero of @xmath274 is @xmath312 which lies between @xmath313 and @xmath131 .",
    "in particular @xmath274 is positive at @xmath314 .",
    "assume that this is true for @xmath139 and the relation for zeroes of @xmath77 other than @xmath131 gives @xmath315 with the coefficient of @xmath139 being negative due to .",
    "at @xmath316 the relation reads @xmath317 but at @xmath318 we get @xmath319 because @xmath139 is positive to the left of its smallest zero , which is greater than @xmath320 . in other words , @xmath281 is positive at @xmath321 , and negative at @xmath320 and then changes the sign between the subsequent zeros of @xmath77 because @xmath139 does so . at the last but one zero ( of @xmath77 ) it thus has the sign of @xmath322 ( number of zeroes of @xmath77 except the last ) , and close to the left of the last zero @xmath77 and @xmath139 both",
    "have the sign @xmath322 because their leading terms are @xmath323 .",
    "however , they enter the relation with negative coefficients ( @xmath324 when @xmath112 ) which means that @xmath281 changes sign additionally before the last root of @xmath131 .",
    "last thing to check is the @xmath72 case , for which @xmath325 .",
    "this finishes the proof that @xmath288 has @xmath305 real simple roots ."
