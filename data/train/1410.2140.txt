    "the benchmarks for optimal performance of heat engines and refrigerators , under reversible conditions , are the carnot efficiency @xmath4 , and the carnot coefficient of performance @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath6 is the ratio of cold to hot temperatures of the reservoirs . for finite - time models such as in the endoreversible approximation @xcite and the symmetric low - dissipation carnot engines @xcite , the maximum power output is obtained at the so called curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) efficiency , @xmath7 @xcite . however , ca - value is not as universal as @xmath8 . for small temperature differences ,",
    "its lower order terms are obtained within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "thus models with tight - coupling fluxes yield @xmath9 as the efficiency at maximum power .",
    "further , if we have a left - right symmetry , then the second - order term @xmath10 is also universal @xcite .    on the other hand , the problem of finding universal benchmarks for finite - time refrigerators is non - trivial .",
    "for instance , the rate of refrigeration ( @xmath11 ) , which seems a natural choice for optimization , can not be optimized under the assumption of a newtonian heat flow ( @xmath12 ) between a reservoir and the working medium @xcite . in that case , the maximum rate of refrigeration is obtained as the coefficient of performance ( cop ) @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "so instead , a useful target function @xmath14 has been used @xcite , where @xmath11 is the heat absorbed per unit time by the working substance from the cold bath , or the rate of refrigeration .",
    "the corresponding cop is found to be @xmath15 , for both the endoreversible and the symmetric low - dissipation models .",
    "so this value is usually regarded as the analog of ca - value , applicable to the case of refrigerators .    in any case",
    ", the usual benchmarks for optimal performance of thermal machines are decided by recourse to optimization of a chosen target function .",
    "the method also presumes a complete knowledge of the intrinsic energy scales , so that , in principle , these scales can be tuned to achieve the optimal performance . in this letter",
    ", we present a different perspective on this problem .",
    "we consider a situation where we have a limited or partial information about the internal energy scales , so that we have to perform an inference analysis @xcite in order to estimate the performance of the machine .",
    "inference implies arriving at plausible conclusions assuming the truth of the given premises .",
    "thus the objective of inference is not to predict the `` true '' behavior of a physical model but to arrive a rational guess based on incomplete information . in this context",
    ", the role of prior information becomes central . in the spirit of bayesian probability theory ,",
    "we treat all uncertainty probabilistically and assign a prior probability distribution to the uncertain parameters @xcite .",
    "we define an average or expected measure of the performance , using the assigned prior distribution .",
    "the approach was proposed by one of the authors @xcite and has been then applied to different models of heat engines @xcite .",
    "these works show that ca - efficiency can be reproduced as a limiting value when the prior - averaged work or power in a heat cycle is optimized .",
    "in particular , for the problem of maximum work extraction from finite source and sink , the behavior of efficiency at maximum estimate of work shows universal features near equilibrium @xcite , e.g. @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "similarly , other expressions for efficiency at maximum power , such as in irreversible models of stochastic engines @xcite , which obey a different universality near equilibrium , can also be reproduced from the inference based approach @xcite .",
    "however , so far the approach has not been applied to other kinds of thermal machines such as refrigerators .",
    "it is not obvious , beforehand , that the probabilistic approach can be useful in case of refrigerators also .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the prior probability approach by taking the paradigmatic feynman s ratchet and pawl model @xcite .",
    "we show that the prior information infers not only the ca - efficiency @xmath17 in the engine mode , but also the @xmath18 value in the refrigerator mode of the model .",
    "further , we point out that the expected heat flows in the averaged model behave as newtonian flows .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model of feynman s ratchet as heat engine and discuss its optimal configuration . in section 2.1 ,",
    "the approach based on prior information is applied to the case when the efficiency of the engine is fixed , but the internal energy scales are uncertain .",
    "the approach is extended to the refrigerator mode , in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss alternate models where also the use of jeffreys prior leads to emergence of ca efficiency .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to discussion of results and conclusions .",
    "the model of feynman s ratchet as a heat engine consists of two heat baths with temperatures @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "a vane , immersed in the hot bath , is connected through an axle with a ratchet in contact with the cold bath , see fig.[fig - ratchet ] .",
    "the rotation of the ratchet is restricted in one direction due to a pawl which in turn is connected to a spring .",
    "the axle passes through the center of a wheel from which hangs a weight .",
    "so the directed motion of the ratchet rotates the wheel , thereby lifting the weight . to raise the pawl",
    ", the system needs @xmath21 amount of energy to overcome the elastic energy of the spring .",
    "suppose that in each step , the wheel rotate an angle @xmath22 and the torque induced by the weight be @xmath23 . then the system requires a minimum of @xmath24 energy to lift the weight .",
    "hence the rate of forward jumps for lifting the weight is given as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a rate constant and we have set boltzmann s constant @xmath27",
    ".        the statistical fluctuations can produce a directed motion at a finite rate , only if the ratchet - pawl system is mesoscopic .",
    "hence the pawl can undergo a brownian motion by bouncing up and down as it is immersed in a finite temperature bath .",
    "this turns the wheel in backward direction and lowers the position of the weight .",
    "this is the reason that the system can not work as an engine if @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the rate of the backward jumps is @xmath29 thus one can regard @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the work done by and on the system , respectively . in an infinitesimally small time interval @xmath32 , the work done by the system is given as @xmath33 thus the power output of the engine is defined as @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the rate of heat absorbed from the hot reservoir , is given as @xmath35 or the amount of heat absorbed in the small time interval is @xmath36 .",
    "then the efficiency of the engine is given by @xmath37 the rate at which waste heat is rejected to the cold reservoir is @xmath38 , which follows from the conservation of energy flux .",
    "the power output , optimized with respect to energy scales @xmath39 and @xmath21 @xcite , is given by @xmath40 the corresponding efficiency at maximum power is @xmath41 further , it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the above expression for efficiency shares some universal properties of efficiency at optimal power found in other finite - time models @xcite .",
    "now we consider a situation where the efficiency of the engine has some pre - specified value @xmath42 , but the energy scales ( @xmath43 ) are not given to us in a priori information .",
    "since @xmath42 is known , the problem is reduced to a single uncertain parameter , due to eq .",
    "( [ efficiency - ratchet ] ) .",
    "one can cast the problem either in terms of @xmath39 or @xmath21 . in terms of the latter , we can write power as @xmath44 analogous to quantification of prior information in bayesian statistics , we assign a prior probability distribution for @xmath21 in some arbitrary , but a finite range of positive values : @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "later we consider an asymptotic range in which the analysis becomes simplified and we observe universal features .",
    "now consider two observers @xmath46 and @xmath47 who respectively assign a prior for @xmath39 and @xmath21 .",
    "taking the simplifying assumption that each observer is in an equivalent state of knowledge , we can write @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the prior distribution function , taken to be of the same form for each observer . at a fixed known value of efficiency",
    ", it implies that @xmath50 , where the normalization constant , @xmath51^{-1}$ ] .",

    "we chose a finite range in order to define a normalized prior distribution .",
    "otherwise , information on the finite values of these scales is not available . on the other hand , as the range is made arbitrarily large , the average power becomes increasingly small .",
    "thus a comparison between the absolute magnitudes of optimal power ( eq . ( [ maxpower ] ) ) and",
    "the prior - averaged power does not seem fruitful .",
    "however , the expected power is seen to become optimal at a certain value of the given efficiency .",
    "further , universal features are shown by this efficiency in the asymptotic limit .",
    "it also provides a good estimate of the actual values of efficiency at maximum power .",

    "we observed in feynman s ratchet that for small temperature differences , the figures of merit at optimal values of @xmath66 and @xmath87 , agree with the corresponding expressions at the optimal values of @xmath156 and @xmath1 .",
    "the important conditions which hold in this comparison are , jeffreys prior as the underlying prior and an asymptotic range of values over which the prior is defined .",
    "in contrast , the uniform prior is not able to generate the optimal behavior in the near equilibrium regime .",
    "further we note that for endoreversible models with a newtonian heat flow between a reservoir and the working medium , the efficiency at optimal power is exactly @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the cop at optimal @xmath1-criterion is given by @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , these values are obtained with an inference based approach assuming incomplete information in a mesoscopic model of heat engine .",
    "we have also shown that our analysis applies to a broader class of idealized models of heat engines / refrigerators , driven by quasi - static processes . here",
    "also , ca efficiency emerges from the use of jeffreys prior , under the given conditions of the model .",
    "we conclude with an argument to support as to why our approach yields the familiar results of finite - time thermodynamics . to exemplify , in the case of feynman s ratchet , the asymptotic range has been considered _",
    "after _ we optimized the expected power output ( in case of engine ) over the efficiency .",
    "one may consider these two steps in the opposite order , i.e. take the asymptotic range first and then perform the optimization .",
    "for that we rewrite eq .",

    "similarly , one can argue for the emergence of @xmath18 in the case of refrigerator mode , in terms of effective heat flows which are newtonian in nature .",
    "interestingly , the above expressions seem to suggest an analogy between the expected mesoscopic model with limited information , and a finite - time thermodynamic model with newtonian heat flows . if we compare with the endoreversible models @xcite",
    ", then we observe that the assumption of a newtonian heat flow goes together with obtaining ca efficiency at maximum power , and cop @xmath18 at optimum @xmath1-criterion .",
    "we however note that the analogy does not hold in entirety .",
    "the effective temperatures defined above do not have physical counterpart in the ratchet model , although in the endoreversible picture , these denote the temperatures of the working medium while in contact with hot or cold reservoirs .",
    "secondly , the heat conductances need not be equal for the endoreversible model with newtonian heat flows .",
    "further , the intermediate temperatures @xmath167 and @xmath168 as above , are equal in magnitude at the maximum expected power @xmath66 . however , for the endoreversible model , these temperatures are not equal at maximum power @xcite . still , the form of expressions for the rates of heat transfer do provide a certain insight into the emergence of the familiar expressions for figures of merit at optimal expected performance within the prior - averaged approach .",
    "finally , we close with a few observations on future lines of enquiry . it was seen in fig .",
    "1 , that for a specified finite range for the prior , the estimates of efficiency at maximum power are either above , or below the estimates in the asymptotic range . in particular , the estimates are function of the values @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain universal results , dependent on the ratio of reservoir temperatures , only in the asymptotic range .",
    "further , the smaller values of the upper limit , overestimate the efficiency ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) whereas the larger values of the lower limit , underestimate the efficiency .",
    "an opposite behavior is seen for the refrigerator mode ( fig .",
    "moreover , this trend for a chosen mode ( engine / refrigerator ) is specific to the choice of the uncertain variable .",
    "thus the trend is reversed , if instead of choosing @xmath21 , we perform the analysis with @xmath39 as the uncertain variable .",
    "this behavior is seen in both the engine as well as the refrigerator mode .",
    "investigation into the relation between inferences derived from the two choices for the uncertain variable , may yield further insight into the behavior of estimated performance and the approach in general .",
    "the point may be appreciated by noting that by specifying a finite - range for the prior we add new information to the probabilistic model . in order that inference may provide a useful and practical guess on the actual performance of the device",
    ", this additional prior information has to be related to some objective features of the model .",

    "<S> we estimate the performance of feynman s ratchet at given values of the ratio of cold to hot reservoir temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and the figure of merit ( efficiency in the case of engine and coefficienct of performance in the case of refrigerator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter implies that only the ratio of two intrinsic energy scales is known to the observer , but their exact values are completely uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the prior probability distribution for the uncertain energy parameters is argued to be jeffreys prior . </S>",
    "<S> we define an average measure for performance of the model by averaging , over the prior distribution , the power output ( heat engine ) or the @xmath1-criterion ( refrigerator ) which is the product of rate of heat absorbed from the cold reservoir and the coefficient of performance . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the figure of merit , at optimal performance close to equilibrium , is reproduced by the prior - averaging procedure . </S>",
    "<S> further , we obtain the well - known expressions of finite - time thermodynamics for the efficiency at optimal power and the coefficient of performance at optimal @xmath1-criterion , given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . this analogy is explored further and we point out that the expected heat flow from and to the reservoirs , behaves as an effective newtonian flow . </S>",
    "<S> we also show , in a class of quasi - static models of quantum heat engines , how ca efficiency emerges in asymptotic limit with the use of jeffreys prior . </S>"
