    "the standard boundary condition for fluid flow along a wall is a no slip condition .",
    "if the wall is at rest , the tangential fluid velocity at the wall vanishes .  the validity of this postulate was already checked in pioneering experiments by coulomb @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial resolution available to coulomb was limited . in our days , we characterise the amount of slip by an extrapolation length @xmath2 ( the navier length ) : the definition of @xmath2 is explained on fig .",
    "the length @xmath2 can be related to the surface friction coefficient @xmath3 defined as follows : the shear stress @xmath4 induces at the wall a surface velocity v@xmath5 : @xmath6    [ h ]    fig1.eps    equating this to the viscous shear stress in the fluid ( of velocity @xmath7 ) , we get : @xmath8    where v@xmath9 is the fluid velocity , increasing linearly with the distance from the wall @xmath10 . when compared with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that eq . [ eq2 ] gives : @xmath11    for most practical situations , with simple fluids ( made of small molecules with a diameter @xmath12 ) , we expect a very small navier length @xmath13 : this has been verified in classical experiments , using a force machine under slow shear @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) a polymer melt , facing a carefully prepared surface , with grafted chains which are chemically identical to the melt : here , when @xmath4 becomes larger than a certain critical value @xmath14 , the navier length jumps to high values ( @xmath1550 microns ) @xcite .  this",
    "can plausibly be explained in terms of polymer dynamics @xcite : at @xmath16 , the grafted chains are sufficiently elongated by the flow to disentangle from the moving chains .",
    "\\2 ) with water flowing in thin , hydrophobic , capillaries , there is some early qualitative evidence for slippage @xcite , @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the role of the hydrophobic surfaces has been analysed theoretically by j.  l.  barrat and coworkers -using analysis plus simulations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they show that the first layer of  water  molecules is depleted in the presence of a hydrophobic wall : this can lead in their case to @xmath17 molecular diameters in a typical case , for a contact angle @xmath18 , corresponding to strong hydrophobicity .",
    "\\4 ) recent experiments by hervet , lger and coworkers are based on a local photobleaching technique ( using evanescent waves ) which probes the velocity field v@xmath9 within 50 nanometers of the surface @xcite .",
    "they studied hexadecane flowing on sapphire : with bare sapphire , no slip was detected .  on a",
    "fully grafted ( methylated ) sapphire , the slip length was found to be large ( 175 nm ) and independent of @xmath4 in the observed range .",
    "this is a surprise :  a ) we do not expect any hydrophobic effect here  b ) even if it was present , the @xmath2 values are much larger than the barrat - bocquet estimates .",
    "\\5 ) similar ( as yet unpublished ) results have been obtained by zhu and granick ( using a force machine ) and by tabeling ( using etched microcapillaries ) .",
    "the results @xcite and @xcite are unexpected and stimulating .",
    "this led us to think about unusual  processes which could take place near a wall .  in the present note ,",
    "we discuss one ( remote ) possibility : the formation of a gaseous film at the solid / liquid interface .",
    "the source of the film is unclear : when the contact angle is large ( @xmath19 ) , a type of flat bubble can form at the surface with a relative low energy .",
    "but this energy is still high when compared to @xmath20    we first considered flat vapor bubbles generated at the solid fluid interface by thermal fluctuations .",
    "but the typical thickness of these bubbles turns out to be very small : of order ( @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the temperature , and @xmath23 the surface tension ) , even when @xmath24 is closed to 180@xmath25 : thus , this brings us back to the barrat picture , with deplection in one first layer of the liquid .",
    "another possible source is an external gas dissolved in the liquid , up to metastable concentrations : this would then nucleate bubbles preferentially near the wall if @xmath26    in section 2 , we simply assume that there exists a uniform gas film of thickness @xmath0 , larger than the molecule size @xmath12 , but smaller than the mean free path @xmath1 in the gas .",
    "we calculate the navier length @xmath2 for this case , and find large values .",
    "the possible meaning of this result is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the situation is shown on fig . [ fig2 ] .  in the knudsen regime ,",
    "gas molecules travel freely in the film and hit the boundaries .",
    "we assume that there is no specular reflection on either boundary .",
    "then , a molecule leaving the liquid will have a gausian velocity distribution for the tangential component v@xmath27 , with the peak of this gausian at velocity v@xmath5 ( the translational velocity at the liquid surface ) .  on the average , it will transmit a momentum @xmath28v@xmath5 to the solid .",
    "the number of such hits per second is @xmath29v@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gas density , @xmath28 the molecular mass , and v@xmath30 the normal component of velocity .",
    "[ h ]    fig2.eps    this leads to a shear stress : @xmath32    with : @xmath33    where v@xmath34    eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) gives us a precise value of the friction coefficient @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and from it , we arrive at a navier length : @xmath35    ( the @xmath36 term is du to the distance between liquid surface and solid surface ; it is completely negligible in practice ) .",
    "if we choose typical values , @xmath37g / liter ,  v@xmath38m / sec , and @xmath39poises , we find @xmath407 microns .",
    "thus , a gas film can indeed give a very large slip length .",
    "our calculation assumed complete thermalisation at each particle / boundary collision .",
    "if we had some non zero reflectance ( especially on the solid surface ) , this would increase @xmath2 even more .",
    "when gas films with thickness @xmath0 in the interval @xmath41 are present in a flow experiment , they may indeed generate a strong slippage , independent of the film thickness .",
    "but the process which could generate such films remains obscure .",
    "if , for some reason , the liquid entering the channel was supersaturated with a certain gas , a pressure drop in the channel could indeed promote the release of gas bubbles .",
    "if the solid surface is not very wettable ( @xmath42 ) , the bubbles should preferentially nucleate at the liquid / solid interface ( as they do in a glass of champaign ) .",
    "then , we would have to postulate that the shear flow transforms them into a flat film , provided that the shear stress is strong enough to flatten them .",
    "indeed , in the zhu - granick experiments , there is a threshold stress , but it is much smaller than what would result from a compromise between shear stress and surface tension for small bubbles .    it is worth emphasizing that the amount of gas required to lubricate the solid liquid contact is very small : if @xmath43 is the macroscopic width of the shear flow , the weight fraction of gas required is : @xmath44      on the whole , we can not present a complete explanation of the anomalous navier lengths based on gas films . but",
    "the films may possibly show up in some instances ; e.g. if the liquid is purposely oversaturated with gas : then eq . [ eq6 ] may become useful ."
