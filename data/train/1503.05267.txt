    "scale - dependence of the spectrum of the curvature perturbation has been used to discriminate inflationary scenarios  @xcite . in addition to the scalar mode , recent discovery of the b - mode polarization@xcite",
    "has ignited studies of the tensor modes .",
    "although the detection of the inflationary tensor mode by the bicep2 was not successful , it stimulated study of the mechanism of generating peculiar scale - dependence  @xcite . besides those recent trends in inflationary cosmology",
    ", models of particle physics ( e.g , supersymmetric models and string theory ) are expecting a large amount of scalar fields that may be dynamical in the very early stage of inflation . in the light of multi - field inflation",
    ", those extra degrees of freedom may alter the scale - dependence of both the tensor and the scalar perturbations .",
    "consequently , they may bring in a kind of ambiguity to the inflationary parameters . even if one is able to assume that the inflaton is the only dynamical field",
    ", it is still hard to believe that the inflaton velocity `` before '' inflation coincides with the slow - roll velocity `` during '' inflation .",
    "initially the inflaton velocity could deviate from the slow - roll ( attractor ) velocity and it will lead to the shift of the scale - dependence . these effects are very common and they can be responsible for the scale dependence of the spectrum .",
    "we start with the obvious situation .",
    "the model shown in fig.[fig1 ] is a textbook example , which helps understand why it is very easy to shift the scale - dependence of the spectrum .",
    "we focus on the simple and common dynamics .",
    "since the scale dependence is currently used to constrain inflation models , it is very important to consider the shift of the scale dependence which could be caused by the dynamics that does not appear in the original inflation model .",
    "we call such dynamics the `` scalon '' , since it contributes only to the generation of the scale dependence .",
    "our study can be discriminated from other attempts in which non - trivial interactions play the key role .",
    "we are considering ubiquitous remnants .",
    "we also consider the case in which the field is not negligible at the end of inflation .",
    "the model is presented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "finally we consider single - field inflation in which small deviation from the slow - roll velocity can cause significant shift of the scale dependence .",
    "we show that in those cases the observation of the spectral index of the tensor mode will play important role in finding the scalon contribution .",
    "more precise measurement of the higher runnings of the scalar spectrum will be helpful for the discrimination .",
    "we briefly explain the overview before the details . we are focusing on the generality of the situation and considering simple dynamics of a scalar field .",
    "we thus avoid introduction of specific interactions and non - trivial kinetic terms .",
    "this point could be distinguishable from the other recent attempts  @xcite .",
    "single - field inflation `` usually '' expects @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the tensor - to - scalar ratio and @xmath2 is the spectral index of the tensor mode .",
    "the relation could be violated if there are multiple scalar fields during inflation .",
    "intuitively we are expecting simple cases for multi - field inflation explained below .",

    "the scalon remains dynamical until the end of inflation .",
    "the curvature perturbation is generated at the end .    in both cases the curvature perturbation at the pivot scale",
    "is unchanged , while the scale dependence is shifted by the scalon .    before explaining more details",
    ", we point out that similar ( but opposite ) situation already appeared in the curvaton model . in the simplest curvaton model ,",
    "in which the slow - roll parameters of the curvaton field is negligible ( i.e , the curvaton dynamics can not generate the scale dependence ) , the scale dependence is generated by the dynamics of the inflaton field whose perturbation is negligible in the curvaton model . in that case",
    "the inflaton dynamics contributes only to the scale dependence .",
    "note that the field ( or the dynamics ) that contributes only to the scale dependence may commonly appear in any inflationary model .",
    "similar effect may appear without adding a scalar field , as we will describe the situation below for single - field inflation .",
    "* inflaton velocity may have deviation from the slow - roll velocity . in that case",
    "the curvature perturbation is known to evolve after horizon exit , since the additional degree of freedom ( i.e , the deviation ) forms the decaying mode . in that case",
    "@xmath0 is not satisfied in single - field inflation .",
    "deviation from the slow - roll velocity may have serious impact on the scale dependence .",
    "we will consider this possibility in sec.[dev - slow ] .",
    "the sign of the spectral index could be reversed .",
    "the relation @xmath0 is useless in the curvaton scenario , since the form of the curvature perturbation is completely different .",
    "we are not discussing those `` alternative '' models , including modulation ( e.g. modulated reheating ) .",
    "in general , `` multi - field inflation '' includes models in which multiple perturbations contribute the curvature perturbation .",
    "such models are extensively studied since they may have a significant evidence of multi - field inflation in the relation among non - linear parameters  @xcite . to avoid confusions in this paper ,",
    "those models are specifically called `` mixed perturbation scenario '' . in this paper",
    "we are avoiding mixed perturbation scenarios since the non - gaussianity parameter is small .",
    "one might notice that the current cmb data is sometimes used to distinguish multi and single - field inflation .",
    "the major reason could be that there is the stringent upper bound on the isocurvature perturbation .",
    "although an additional field `` can '' generate significant isocurvature perturbations , it is not mandatory . in other cases , as we have stated above , `` multi - field inflation '' sometimes means `` mixed perturbation scenario '' . to avoid those confusions",
    "we emphasize that `` inflation with the scalon dynamics '' will not be distinguishable at this moment ; we mean that the experimental plans at hand will hardly find the distinction .",
    "however , since what we call `` the scalon '' is the very common dynamics that could appear in the early universe , we claim that it has to be identified and removed by more future experiments .",
    "we start with the simplest case .",
    "we introduce the scalon field ( additional free scalar field @xmath3 ) , which is dynamical at the beginning of inflation .",
    "one can imagine the case in which @xmath4 at horizon exit but @xmath5 at the end . here `` @xmath6 '' denotes the value at the horizon exit .",
    "see also fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "using the standard definition of the curvature perturbation , the scalon determine the initial adiabatic curvature perturbation .",
    "we also consider the case with @xmath7 , which can also shift the scale dependence .    .",
    "mixing in the spectrum is negligible . ]",
    "we are considering multi - field inflation .",
    "however , since we are considering a `` temporal '' field in this section , the derivative of the e - foldings with respect to the extra field ( @xmath8 ) is negligible . here",
    "the subscript with comma denotes derivative with respect to the field .",
    "cases with significant @xmath8 has been considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "remember that we are focusing on the simple dynamics that does not assume specific interactions . we will assume canonical kinetic term for the fields .",
    "we are avoiding mixing of the fields in the potential .",
    "the scalon field is separated from the inflaton @xmath9 and ceases to be dynamical before the end of inflation . in that way",
    "our analysis does not depend on specific inflationary model .",
    "one can add @xmath3 to any ( single - field , canonical kinetic term ) inflationary model on one s choice .",
    "when a couple of fields @xmath9 and @xmath3 are dynamical during inflation , the spectral index of the curvature perturbation is calculated as  @xcite @xmath10 where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the adiabatic and entropy directions at the horizon exit .",
    "we choose @xmath13 . here",

    "also we define the curvature and entropy perturbations @xmath25 the curvature perturbation after horizon exit is expressed as @xmath26.\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the observable .",
    "since here we are assuming `` temporal '' @xmath28 at a moment , adiabatic velocity soon reaches @xmath29 after horizon exit .",
    "the final curvature perturbation recovers the original single - field inflation model  @xcite : @xmath30_*$ ] .",
    "let us see more details about the scalon contributions . if @xmath31 , the trajectory has a turn during inflation . initially the adiabatic direction is @xmath32 but it will be @xmath29 before the end of inflation . then the curvature perturbation becomes @xmath33_*\\gg r_*\\simeq \\left[\\frac{h}{\\dot{\\chi}}\\delta \\chi\\right]_*$ ] , which is possible since @xmath34",
    ". then one will find @xmath35 and the spectral index given by @xmath36    the opposite limit ( @xmath37 ) is the standard single - field inflation .",
    "one will find @xmath38 and an almost straight trajectory .",
    "the spectral index will be @xmath39    seeing the above discrepancy between ( [ eq - multiindex - bend ] ) and ( [ eq - multiindex - straight ] ) , one may find that the situation is intuitively similar to the curvaton .",
    "more radical situation can be found in the inflating curvaton  @xcite . in the above formalism one has to take into account the scale - dependence of the transfer function @xmath22 .",
    "the latter case ( @xmath37 already at the beginning ) seems to be the same as the conventional single - field scenario .",
    "however , as far as @xmath28 , there is the contribution caused by @xmath40 .",
    "although in the spectral index the contribution of the scalon could be negligible , the shift in the higher runnings can be significant since @xmath41 is possible  @xcite",
    ". we will be back to this topic in sec.[running ] .",
    "below , we will examine the relation @xmath0 when @xmath40 .",
    "since one extra degree of freedom is added to the original scenario , we need another observable ( i.e , an independent equation ) that can fix the ambiguity .",
    "the spectral index of the tensor mode can play the role .",
    "the spectrum of the tensor perturbation is @xmath42 , which gives the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath43 when @xmath44 , we find conventional result @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , when @xmath4 , things are not so trivial . to check the consistency of the calculation",
    "it is very useful to consider the equations related to @xmath47 .",

    ", one will find @xmath58 .",
    "although rather complicated , one can evaluate the same result by considering @xmath22  @xcite . to distinguish the scale dependence",
    ", it would be useful to define @xmath59 and evaluate @xmath60 again , discrepancy @xmath61 is the sign of an extra dynamical field .",
    "note that in both limits @xmath54 is the sign of the additional dynamical field .",
    "although @xmath3 introduces ambiguity to the cosmological parameters , the contribution can be removed if @xmath2 is measurable .",
    "the above scenario is a well - known example of multi - field inflation .",
    "although in the past studies we could not find explicit argument that relates the spectral index of the tensor mode to the ambiguity in the inflationary parameters , the above results should have been known among scientists in this field .",
    "below , we will consider less simple examples for which the shift of the scale dependence has not been discussed in detail before .",
    "the usual multi - field model  @xcite considers `` evolution '' of the curvature perturbation during inflation . in the model",
    "represented in fig.[fig1 ] , this effect compensates the curvature perturbation .",
    "the situation we are going to consider in this section is rather different from such scenario .",
    "we introduce the scalon that can survive until the end of inflation .",
    "then , the initial curvature perturbation is compensated by the curvature perturbation generated at the end .",
    "typically the scenario of generating the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation is considered for hybrid - type potential , since the original lyth s model  @xcite considers modulation of the waterfall ( @xmath62 ) . in that way",
    "the lyth s scenario requires interaction with the waterfall field",

    "degeneracy of the mass term ( @xmath80 ) makes the trajectory straight and avoids the effect considered in sec.[modest - multi ] .",
    "the adiabatic field is defined as @xmath81 , which gives @xmath82 we find the end * for the adiabatic field * is @xmath83 which is perturbed when @xmath84 .",

    "more intuitive argument is possible .",

    "the result is quite similar to the conventional `` multi - field '' model in fig.[fig1 ] , although the mechanism of generating the curvature perturbation is utterly different .",
    "the property of the scalon is also different .",
    "for the model considered in this section , @xmath102 can be significant until the end of inflation .",
    "usually the typical hybrid - type model is excluded because its spectrum is blue ( @xmath103 ) . however , as we have seen above , one can introduce a ubiquitous field @xmath3 to change the spectral index into red ( @xmath104 )  @xcite .",
    "again , the spectral index of the tensor mode is needed to distinguish the scalon contribution .",
    "the situation presented in fig.[fig2 ] is quite general .",
    "the mechanism can be applied to any inflationary model in which @xmath3 causes negligible change in @xmath70 .",
    "imagine a potential like @xmath63 with @xmath64 , which is very common .",
    "introduction of the `` extra degree of freedom that is responsible for the scale dependence of the curvature perturbation '' does not always require additional scalar field .",
    "it may appear as a parameter measuring deviation from the inflationary attractor .",
    "first , remember that at the very beginning of inflation the inflaton velocity ( @xmath105 ) may not coincide with the slow - roll velocity ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "moreover , if the inflaton is moving fast in the opposite direction before the onset of inflation , inflaton may even stop during inflation  @xcite .",
    "although the analysis could be slightly model - dependent , the essential of the argument is quite simple .",
    "if the inflaton velocity deviates from the slow - roll velocity defined there ( i.e , @xmath107 ) , the curvature perturbation converges to the value evaluated using the slow - roll velocity .",
    "namely , one will find the evolution of the curvature perturbation @xmath108 before the end of inflation .",
    "intuitively the above result is quite conceivable in the light of the @xmath109 formalism .    since the time - dependence of the quantity @xmath9",
    "is not determined by @xmath106 , the scale - dependence ( i.e , evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath15 that determines @xmath110-dependence of the curvature perturbation ) will be different from the standard scenario . unlike the multi - field model , the correction in the spectral index will appear not only from @xmath111 ( i.e , @xmath57 ) but also from @xmath112 .",

    "note that `` @xmath116 '' is used for quantities without deviation , except for the hubble parameter that always includes @xmath117 for the kinetic energy .",
    "see eq.([slow - def ] ) for the definitions of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "our definition is @xmath118 . in the same way",
    ", we also find @xmath119 where @xmath120 comes from the time derivative of the kinetic energy in the hubble parameter . since the kinetic energy of the inflaton is not identical to the attractor solution",
    ", @xmath121 could not be negligible .",
    "correction to the spectral index is @xmath122 if the hubble parameter can be written as @xmath123 , we find @xmath124 where we used @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . here",
    "we expect @xmath129 for the deviation .",
    "if the inflaton `` stops '' during inflation one will find @xmath130 , which gives @xmath131 .",
    "the result is consistent with the naive intuition : scale dependence disappears when inflaton stops .",
    "since @xmath132 changes quickly during inflation , there will be a signature of @xmath133 in the running of the spectral index .",
    "one will find @xmath134\\nonumber\\\\   & & -6r_{d*}^2\\left[-6\\epsilon_\\phi^{(0)}+4\\epsilon_\\phi^{(0)}\\epsilon_h-2\\eta_\\phi^{(0)}\\epsilon_\\phi^{(0 ) } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contribution related to @xmath135 mainly appears from @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath137 is almost excluded by the observations , we can see that @xmath138 is not a realistic scenario .",
    "note that the blue spectrum of hybrid - type inflation ( @xmath139 for @xmath140 ) can be turned into red when @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the ambiguity related to the deviation is quite serious . even though @xmath1 in hybrid inflation could be very small and the tensor mode could not be seen in the observations , more precise measurement of @xmath142",

    "we find @xmath156 which could be negative if @xmath157 or simply @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "if the universe started with a chaotic state , there could be many dynamical fields before the onset of inflation .",
    "inflationary expansion starts when the vacuum energy of the inflaton starts to dominate . at that moment",
    "the other dynamical fields may have energy density comparable to the inflaton vacuum energy .",
    "if one wants to disregard their effect , these fields must be inflated away before the onset of the last 60 e - foldings .",
    "this is not a trivial assumption since their effect could not be negligible even if their fraction is small . is larger than the planck scale , the fraction of @xmath159 is @xmath160 .",
    "this can not be a `` small fraction '' when the slow - roll parameters of @xmath3 are not negligible .",
    "we are not assuming such significant modification of the original inflationary model . ]    in this paper we first considered a non - interacting field @xmath3 and calculated the possible shift of the scale dependence .",
    "the first model is presented in fig.[fig1 ] , which we considered as a textbook example . in this case the additional inflaton field ( @xmath3 ) may disappear during inflation but it can significantly change the scale dependence of the spectrum . the second model is presented in fig.[fig2 ] , which is less known but is showing a very common situation . in both cases our result illuminates the importance of the observation of the spectral index of the tensor mode .",
    "we also considered a single - field inflation model in which deviation from the slow - roll is not negligible .",
    "we found a similar effect and showed that observation of the tensor mode is important .",
    "note that in the last scenario the shift of the scale - dependence is considered in a single - field inflation model .    in this paper",
    "we have chosen specific scalon dynamics that are very common in the early universe , and showed that the ambiguity caused by the remnant is crucial for the scientific argument .",
    "although our results are encouraging and seemingly suggesting the next step , unfortunately in reality the tensor mode of the inflationary perturbations has not been observed yet and the present experimental plans are not designed to determine the spectral index of the tensor mode accurately enough to distinguish the source of the scale dependence .",
    "nevertheless , we hopefully expect that more future observations will be able to distinguish the scalon effect and our study will be useful for identifying the inflation model .",

    "<S> if the beginning of inflation is defined at the moment when the vacuum energy of the inflaton starts to dominate , the energy density of the other fields at that moment is ( by definition ) comparable to the inflaton . </S>",

    "<S> may not coincide with the slow - roll ( attractor ) velocity </S>",
    "<S> . those dynamics could be ubiquitous but can easily alter the scale dependence of the spectrum . since the scale dependence is currently used to constrain or even exclude inflation models , it is very important to measure its shift , which is due to the dynamics that does not appear in the original inflation model . </S>",
    "<S> considering typical examples , we show that the spectral index of the tensor mode is a useful measure of such effect . </S>",
    "<S> precise measurement of the higher runnings of the scalar mode will be helpful in discriminating the source . </S>"
