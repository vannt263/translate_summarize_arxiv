    "the rovibronic spectra of @xmath0c@xmath1 , involving singlet , triplet , and quintet electronic states , are rich and complex in features as well as in anomalies .",
    "this is true despite the fact that @xmath0c@xmath1 , hereafter simply called c@xmath1 , is a homonuclear diatomic molecule containing only 8 valence electrons .",
    "there are 62 electronic states corresponding to the six possible separated - atom limits formed by different pairs of the c(@xmath21p ) , c(@xmath22d ) , and c(@xmath22s ) atoms .",
    "18 of these states , six singlet , six triplet , and six quintet ones , correspond to the c(@xmath21p ) + c(@xmath21p ) asymptote .",
    "as summarized in table  1 and figure  1 , the measured rovibronic spectroscopy of c@xmath1 is characterized by 19 known band systems , and a further three intercombination transitions , which cover the spectral range @xmath23 @xmath4   and now all three spin states . due to the lack of detailed transition data , see section 2.4 for details , only 14 band systems are considered in the present study .",
    "all the states considered , except the   and the 4  @xmath24 states , share the same c(@xmath21p ) + c(@xmath21p ) separated - atom limit .",
    "the present study was initiated as , rather unusually , at least six of these bands have been used for astronomical observations , with a further one having been proposed for such use .",
    "there are numerous astronomical observations of c@xmath1 spectra with a multitude of important applications for astrophysics .",
    "c@xmath1 spectra have been observed in comets @xcite , in high - temperature stars @xcite , translucent clouds @xcite , and in the low - temperature interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "high - quality studies of rotational and spatial distributions of c@xmath1 in comets are available @xcite .",
    "the astronomical observations and their modelling are supported by a number of laboratory studies @xcite . to make maximum use of the observations one needs accurate rovibronic energy level information , the principal topic of the present paper .",
    "both the swan @xcite and the deslandres ",
    "@xcite bands have been observed in fluorescence from comets .",
    "indeed , two singlet ,  and , and four triplet , , , , and d  @xmath24 , electronic states are needed to model c@xmath1 emission observed in comets . two spin - forbidden transition systems , @xmath25  and @xmath25 , are needed to explain the observed intensities in the swan band @xcite .",
    "the astronomical observations include solar spectra , where c@xmath1 forms an important component of the photospheric carbon abundance @xcite .",
    "so , for example , c@xmath1 can be observed in the sun s photosphere at visible wavelengths using the swan band @xcite and in the infrared via the phillips and ballik  ramsay bands @xcite .",
    "transitions in the swan band have also been observed in peculiar white dwarfs @xcite and the coronae borealis star v coronae australis @xcite , while the phillips band is prominent , for example , in the carbon star hd19557 @xcite .",
    "transitions in the ballik  ramsay band have also been observed in carbon stars @xcite .",
    "interstellar c@xmath1 has been observed via the infrared phillips band , for example in the perseus molecular complex @xcite and toward the cyg ob2 association @xcite .",
    "emission features from the swan band have been observed in the red rectangle @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed absorbotion in the phillips , mulliken and herzberg f bands in their study of translucent clouds by the simultaneous use of observations from both space and ground - based telescopes .    the rovibrational manifolds of the   and   states strongly overlap as the corresponding electronic excitation energy is less than half of the vibrational spacing in either state .",
    "@xcite suggested that long - wavelength transitions between levels in the   ",
    "band should provide a good method for monitoring interstellar c@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite attempted to observe such lines in the hale ",
    "bopp comet , without success .",
    "the accurate rovibronic energy levels presented in this paper can be used to provide accurate transitions for such features .    as for the other bands , at ultraviolet wavelengths the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue )",
    "was used to observe c@xmath1 towards x persei via the herzberg f band @xcite .",
    "the hubble space telescope also has been used to monitor c@xmath1 absorption in the ultraviolet using both the mulliken and the herzberg f bands @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that all of the bands mentioned are important in laboratory plasmas @xcite and flames @xcite .",
    "for example , there are particular vibrational bands of the swan system known as the high pressure ( hp ) bands @xcite which can be prominent in such environments at atmospheric pressure",
    ".    studies of the spectra , and thus the band systems , of c@xmath1 date all the way back to @xcite and the dawn of spectroscopy , when c@xmath1 emissions were first observed in flames .",
    "detailed studies by @xcite of the most prominent band of c@xmath1 also predate the development of the quantum mechanical tools required to interpret the spectroscopic results obtained . over the following century and a half ,",
    "a number of other bands have been detected and studied .",
    "indeed , four band systems have been identified during the last decade @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : bands ] lists the known band systems of c@xmath1 relevant for the present study .",
    "a large number of spectroscopic measurements exist for the different band systems of c@xmath1 .",
    "all the studies which contain primary measured transitions at a reasonable level of accuracy are considered during the present analysis .",
    "the experimental papers found and analysed by us are listed here based on the band systems : phillips @xcite , mulliken @xcite , bernath  b @xcite , bernath  b@xmath26 @xcite , freymark @xcite , ballik ",
    "ramsay @xcite , swan @xcite , fox ",
    "herzberg @xcite , deslandres  dazambuja @xcite , messerle ",
    "krauss @xcite , + goodwin ",
    "cool @xcite , duck @xcite , krechkivska - schmidt @xcite and radi - bornhauser @xcite , as well as various spin - changing intercombination bands @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for a long time a triplet state , now named , was believed to be the lowest electronic state of c@xmath1 and not a singlet state , the true ground electronic state , .",
    "the source of the confusion , detailed in @xcite , is that the energy difference between the two electronic states is only about one half of the vibrational fundamental of either state so that the swan system can be seen in absorption in many sources .",
    "the spectroscopy and the spectroscopic constants of c@xmath1 have been the subject of several reviews @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the analysis of seven singlet and seven triplet states . @xcite reviewed the then available experimental and theoretical results .",
    "the spectroscopic and kinetic properties of c@xmath1 , including 23 electronic states studied prior to 1992 , were reviewed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviewed the spectroscopy of small carbon clusters which , once again , covered the extensive spectroscopic literature available for c@xmath1 .",
    "the present paper surveys all rovibronically - resolved measurements made up to the end of 2015 .    a large number of _ ab initio _ computations have been performed on c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "notable among the sophisticated electronic structure computations are those of bacskay @xcite ; for example , they led to the observation of the duck band and enabled the identification of the krechkivska ",
    "schmidt band system .",
    "@xcite pointed out that `` at the present state of the art , theoretical pecs that reproduce the rotational - vibrational levels to spectroscopic accuracy ( 1 @xmath4 ) or near spectroscopic accuracy ( 10 @xmath4 ) are considered highly accurate . ''",
    "reproduction of measured electronic excitation energies of c@xmath1 appears to be even more problematic , an accuracy of a few hundred @xmath4   seems to be the norm .",
    "thus , it is still of interest to perform accurate quantum chemical computations on c@xmath1 and its rovibronic states .",
    "results of a preliminary , first - principles analysis are reported here ( _ vide infra _ ) , used in particular for checking the experimental transitions and energy levels .",
    "the main body of the present work is a marvel ( measured active rotational - vibrational energy levels ) @xcite analysis of the measured rovibronic states of c@xmath1 .",
    "our analysis has been in progress for four years but a real breakthrough came with the study of @xcite , who observed 16 forbidden transitions between singlet and triplet states .",
    "this study coupled , for the first time , the singlet and triplet components of the observed spectroscopic network ( sn ) @xcite of c@xmath1 , allowing a much improved analysis of its rovibronic energy level structure .",
    "we analyze all the known bands of c@xmath1 with the exception of the five vuv bands due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these bands involve upper energy levels which arise from a single experiment and are too high for us to be able to independently validate them .",
    "finally , when a complete set of accurate energy levels are available for a molecule , they can be used , via the direct summation technique , to compute accurate ideal - gas thermodynamic functions , most importantly the high - temperature internal partition function , @xmath27 .",
    "we do this here for c@xmath1 , complementing and improving several previous efforts @xcite and arrive at very precise and accurate values for @xmath27 of c@xmath1 up to 4,000 k.    .",
    "the blue , red , and green dots correspond to the singlet , triplet , and quintet rovibronic states , respectively .",
    "the dots represent energy levels and only some of the transitions are visible , especially those connecting the singlet and the triplet as well as the triplet and the quintet rovibrational states.,height=566 ]",
    "the marvel @xcite procedure and code is used in this study to obtain rovibronic energies of c@xmath1 by inverting all assigned experimental rovibronic transitions available in the literature for this molecule .",
    "marvel is based on the concept of spectroscopic networks ( sn ) @xcite : sns are large , finite , weighted , rooted graphs , where the vertices are discrete energy levels ( with associated uncertainties ) , the edges are transitions ( with measured uncertainties ) , and in a simple picture the weights are provided by the transition intensities .",
    "no weights are considered during the present study . within the experimental sn of a molecule",
    "there can be several rooted components and several floating ones .",
    "for many molecules the rooted components belong to ortho and para nuclear spin isomers .",
    "however , the nuclear spin of @xmath0c is zero ; thus , @xmath0c@xmath1 has only one nuclear spin isomer and one root for its lowest electronic state , .",
    "transitions between electronic states of different spin multiplicity are spin forbidden ; thus , until 2011 no lines were measured and assigned experimentally between the singlet and triplet and the triplet and quintet manifold of states of c@xmath1 .",
    "first , @xcite observed transitions linking triplet and quintet electronic states , leading to the first observation and characterization of a quintet band of c@xmath1 .",
    "later , @xcite managed to identify 16 spin - forbidden transitions between singlet and triplet states .",
    "these spin - forbidden transitions proved to be particularly important during the marvel analysis of the experimental spectra of c@xmath1 . using these forbidden transitions the experimental sn of c@xmath1 simplifies as",
    "now it contains only one principal component ( pc ) .",
    "the label of the root of the pc is \\{0 +  0 @xmath3 @xmath28 } , for the notation employed for the label see subsection [ s : qn ] .",
    "the measured sn of c@xmath1 is shown pictorially in figure 2 , the singlet , triplet , and quintet energy levels are indicated with different colors . since figure 2 is a particular representation of a network ( @xmath29 , a graph ) , the arrangement of the nodes ( energy levels ) and links ( transitions ) is arbitrary , but clearly displays several important characteristics of the sn of c@xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 vividly shows , for example , how weakly the singlet rovibrational energy levels are connected to the triplet core .      during a marvel analysis",
    "we simultaneously process all the available assigned and labelled experimental transitions .",
    "the energy levels are obtained from the set of transitions via a weighted linear least - squares inversion protocol . as the marvel technique has been employed to determine experimental - quality energy levels of nine isotopologues of water @xcite , of three isotopologues of h@xmath30 @xcite , as well as of ammonia @xcite and ketene @xcite , the interested reader is referred to these publications for details about the different stages of a marvel analysis .",
    "since c@xmath1 has both regular and inverted triplet states ( see the next subsection for details ) , for example the   and   of c@xmath1 are inverted , during the marvel analysis it was checked whether the labels of all experimental transitions follow the same convention .    at the beginning , the marvel analysis of the spectra of c@xmath1 was complicated by the fact that there have been no truly high - accuracy variational or effective hamiltonian rovibronic energy levels available for this molecule at higher energies .",
    "this situation greatly improved by the first - principles duo   @xcite analysis performed as part of this study ( _ vide infra _ ) , allowing at least a preliminary validation of the marvel levels up to 35,000 @xmath4 .      for marvel to work",
    "properly one needs appropriate and unique labels .",
    "the label used in the present study for a rovibronic energy level is built up from information concerning the uncoupled electronic state , the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers , and the symmetry of the rovibronic state .",
    "the label finally chosen for each energy level , @xmath31 , fully characterizes the rovibronic states of a homonuclear diatomic molecule , such as c@xmath1 , but contains redundant information @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the quantum number corresponding to the total angular momentum ( an integer value ) characterizing the state , @xmath33 labels the total state parity , @xmath34 , in terms of the laboratory - fixed inversion operator @xmath35 @xcite , ` state ' is the customary term symbol of the electronic state before spin - orbit coupling is taken into account ( _ e.g. _ , x  @xmath36 and b  @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the vibrational quantum number .",
    "the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , label denotes the spin multiplet components : for singlet states @xmath41 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath42 , for triplet states @xmath43 , which corresponds to the standard spectroscopic notation @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( @xmath3 , @xmath46 , @xmath45 refer to levels with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the quantum number corresponding to the angular momentum exclusive of nuclear and electron spin and it is usually not a good quantum number ) , and for quintet states @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the convention @xcite is such that whether the state is regular ( @xmath50 ) or inverted ( @xmath51 ) , the energy order is always @xmath52 for the triplet states .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 subscript in the ` state ' label indicate if the symmetry of the electronic state is ` gerade ' ( positive ) or ` ungerade ' ( negative ) in terms of the molecule - fixed inversion operator , @xmath55 @xcite . the @xmath33 superscripts within the @xmath56 states indicate the parity of the electronic component with respect to vertical reflection , @xmath57 , in the molecular frame @xcite .",
    "the rotationless parity @xmath58 is a widely used alternative to the total parity @xmath33 , this redundant information is included in our marvel label to help experimentalists . for c@xmath1 the allowed combination of the parity @xmath33 and the label g / u is ( @xmath59,g ) and ( @xmath5,u ) .",
    "the rotationless parity @xmath58 is then obtained as follows : ( a ) for the @xmath28 states , the parity ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) can be recovered as @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for the even values of @xmath63 the parity of the @xmath28 states is @xmath60 , while for odd @xmath63s it is @xmath61 ; and ( b ) for the @xmath64 states , the parity is recovered as @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for even @xmath63s the parity is @xmath61 , and for odd @xmath63s it is @xmath60 .",
    "the rigorous electric dipole selection rules for the rovibronic transitions are @xmath66    as mentioned , the nuclear spin statistical weights @xmath67 of the nuclear spin - zero @xmath0c@xmath1 molecule for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 states is 1 , while the @xmath70 and @xmath71 states have @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the latter states do not appear in spectroscopic experiments on @xmath0c@xmath1 .",
    "the marvel input set of measured transitions was checked for a corresponding labeling error .",

    "while this is a complete set , the energy levels are of limited accuracy .",
    "thus , whenever possible , the duo  energy levels are replaced by the incomplete but accurate set of marvel rovibronic energies .",

    "the second is the lack of a complete set of bound rovibronic energy levels .",
    "the third is associated with the treatment , including the possible neglect , of the unbound states .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in @xmath27 can be estimated straightforwardly using the uncertainty of each energy level and an error propagation formula .",
    "all experimental ( marvel ) energy levels have an associated uncertainty , while an uncertainty of 5.0 @xmath4   was assumed for the uncertainties of all the duo levels .",
    "( note that this uncertainty estimate is rather pessimistic . )",
    "figure  [ fig : qerror ] ( solid line ) shows the impact of the uncertainties of the energy levels on the uncertainty of @xmath27 .",
    "it can be seen that up to about 2,500 k this type of uncertainty is dominant , but its maximum value , occurring at the lowest temperatures , is still less than 0.01% .",
    "estimation of the second type of error is hard since ( a ) the exact number of the energy levels is unknown , and ( b ) the value of the partition function grows monotonically as more and more energy levels are considered in the direct sum .",
    "therefore , only an approximate convergence can be reached at higher temperatures during the direct summation . to check the convergence of the partition function",
    "we need a larger set of energy levels ; therefore , we computed approximate rovibronic energy levels for all the electronic states considered , using the spectroscopic constants published by @xcite up to 70,000 @xmath4 .",
    "using the spectroscopic constants of 27 electronic states we could determine 332  347 extra energy levels above 35,000 @xmath4 .",

    "nevertheless , the maximum uncertainty is still less than 0.1% at 4,000 k , which is acceptable for probably all practical applications . in case of c@xmath1 ,",

    "figure  [ fig : qdiff ] shows the result of the comparison of our @xmath27 with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the earlier studies always yield smaller numbers for the partition function of c@xmath1 than the present study .",
    "a possible explanation is that we use a larger ( more complete ) set of energy levels .",
    "note that the temperature range of the two earlier works begins from 1,000 k.    figure  [ fig : cpdiff ] shows the difference between our @xmath181 results and the janaf @xcite , @xcite , esa @xcite , and @xcite and @xcite data .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath181 values from 0 k to 6,000 k , but @xcite corrected his values above 2,000 k. while there is good agreement with the esa and altman & clementi data at low temperatures , the difference begins to increase with the temperature .",
    "conversely , for gurvich and janaf , the differences , especially compared to those of gurvich & veyts , are surprisingly large at lower temperatures .",
    "@xcite also found this discrepancy cpncerning the gurvich & veyts ( nasa ) data at lower temperatures ; nevertheless , they could not explain this strange behavior .",
    "we believe that the problem originates from the incorrect usage of @xmath184 values in @xcite . the standard ( spectroscopic ) energy expansions use @xmath158 as a minimum - to - minimum excitation energy ; in this case the rovibronic energy levels of the upper electronic state will be shifted by the difference of the zero - point energies , by about 0.5 @xmath185 .",
    "to get the correct energies , the @xmath159 values should be used instead of the @xmath158 values .",
    "the first excited electronic state usually lies much above the ground state ; therefore , this relatively small shift does not cause a significant problem if left out of consideration .",
    "however , in the case of c@xmath1 , where the relative energy of the   state is smaller than the vibrational fundamental of either state , the incorrect use of @xmath158 leads to wrong @xmath181 values at lower temperatures .",
    "table  8 gives coefficients of the least squares fit to our computed partition function using the traditional form of @xcite @xmath186    in order to get the best reproduction of the directly computed values , the fit had to be performed in two separate temperature ranges .",
    "the first range is @xmath187 k , the other is @xmath188 k. these fits can reproduce the values of log@xmath183 reasonably accurately , within 0.1% in either region .",
    "nevertheless , to take full advantage of the high accuracy of the present thermochemical reults for c@xmath1 , the numerical results of the supplementary information should be used .",
