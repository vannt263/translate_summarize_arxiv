    "dust properties govern several physical and chemical phenomena in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and act as a tracer of local environmental conditions .",
    "when starlight passes through various components of interstellar dust grains , which are aligned to the galactic magnetic field , the radiation becomes partially plane - polarized , typically at the level of a few percent .",
    "the nature of this polarization reveals important information regarding the shape , size and composition of interstellar dust .",
    "the detailed process(es ) by which grains get aligned with the magnetic fields has ( have ) long been , and is still actively under study ( davis & greenstein 1951 ; dolginov 1990 ; cho & lazarian 2005 ) . in general the dust grains tend to align with their long axis perpendicular to the magnetic field ( purcell 1979 ) .",
    "the clue to the interstellar origin of the polarization came from the observed correlation between the degree of polarization ( @xmath15 ) and the colour excess , @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath15 ( in visual wavelengths ) for the stars with large @xmath16 are found to be in the range between zero and a maximum value given by @xmath17 ( aannestad & purcell 1973 ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath9 and the colour excess , and the variation of @xmath15 with wavelength , are interpreted in terms of the grain properties and the efficiency of the grain alignment .",
    "therefore , polarimetry is a useful technique to investigate the properties like maximum polarization @xmath18 , the wavelength @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath18 and the orientation of the magnetic field in various galactic locations .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic information already available for stars in open clusters are specifically important to make a meaningful study of the dust grains located in the foreground and in the intracluster regions ( e.g. , trumpler 27 , feinstein et al .",

    "<S> the small dispersion in polarization angle could be due to the presence of uniform dust layer beyond 1 kpc . </S>",

    "<S> it is also found that towards the direction of ngc 1893 , the dust layer that exists between 2 - 3 kpc has a negligible contribution towards the total observed polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the weighted mean for percentage of polarization ( @xmath9 ) and the wavelength at maximum polarization ( @xmath10 ) are found to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 m respectively . </S>",
