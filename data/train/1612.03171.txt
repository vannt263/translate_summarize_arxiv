    "the observed radial surface - brightness ( or surface - density ) profiles of stars in disc galaxies are approximately exponential , @xmath5 .",
    "this result dates back to work by @xcite and @xcite but was extended and popularized by @xcite , and we shall use the term  freeman discs \" to describe galaxies of this kind . in some galaxies there are clear systematic deviations from the freeman disc at large radii @xcite ; and at small radii there are commonly more stars than expected in a freeman disc , an excess usually attributed to a bulge component .",
    "nonetheless , the freeman disc has proven to be a remarkably good approximation to the stellar profile in a large majority of disc - dominated galaxies .",
    "attempts have been made to explain these profiles as a reflection of the angular - momentum distribution of the gas from which the stars formed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we set out to provide a qualitatively different explanation , one that is based on the dynamical evolution of the disc rather than the initial conditions , a possibility that has not received much attention in the literature until recently @xcite . in this paper , we argue on the basis of a simple analytical model that disc surface - density profiles are a natural consequence of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of galactic discs .",
    "while the characteristic size of a stellar disc presumably reflects its initial angular momentum , a wide range of work suggests that the present - day _ profile _ of the disc is not primarily a reflection of initial conditions .",
    "simulations of the formation of disc galaxies find that the profile of stellar birth radii is quite often far from a freeman disc @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , simulations of both isolated disc galaxies @xcite , and galaxies forming in a cosmological context @xcite show that approximate freeman disc profiles eventually emerge .",
    "this evolution arises because stars do not remain on the orbits on which they were born , even in the absence of substantive mergers .",
    "both analytic arguments and numerical experiments show that the angular momenta of individual disc particles are `` churned '' or `` shuffled '' by co - rotating , transient , non - axisymmetric perturbations such as spiral arms ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this mechanism preserves the small orbital eccentricities of the initial disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be very efficient @xcite , and does not change the total angular momentum of the disc stars appreciably ( see  2.3.2 ) ; it has been dubbed _",
    "radial migration_.    in this paper we explore what radial surface - density profiles are the end - state of radial migration .",
    "we adopt the idealizing , but we believe sensible , approximations that stars are born , and remain , on circular orbits , and that the total angular momentum and mass of the disc are conserved , while radial migration scrambles the individual stellar angular momenta .",
    "if the angular momenta are completely scrambled , then their final distribution should have the maximum entropy possible , subject to the just - mentioned constraints .    applying concepts from statistical mechanics to describe the equilibrium phase - space distribution in a self - gravitating stellar system has proven problematic for a variety of reasons ,",
    "the most important of which is that the volume of phase space enclosed by a surface of constant energy is not finite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we shall argue that the angular - momentum distribution resulting from radial migration _ can _ be described by maximizing a suitably defined entropy , using methods that are completely analogous to deriving the boltzmann distribution for ideal gases .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : toy_model ] we describe our model and in  [ sec : application ] we derive an analytic expression for the surface - density profile corresponding to a given galactic rotation curve . in  [ sec : validation ] we compare the predictions of this work to data from observations and simulations . finally , we discuss the results and implications of our model in  [ sec : discussion ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : self_consistent ] we derive the unique maximum - entropy surface - density profile in the special case of a disc that has no surrounding dark halo .",
    "we work in cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 and use action - angle variables @xmath7 as phase - space coordinates @xcite .",
    "action - angle variables are canonical so @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ordinary cartesian momentum conjugate to @xmath10 .",
    "since stars are born on nearly circular , coplanar orbits and migration does not excite eccentricities or inclinations ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) we may assume that @xmath11 .",
    "the azimuthal action @xmath12 is equal to the angular momentum per unit mass along the @xmath13-axis , @xmath0 , and we can restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional manifold in phase space @xmath14 .",
    "the angle variables @xmath15 are uniformly distributed so the state of a disc of @xmath16 stars is fully specified by the angular momenta @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 and the stars interact weakly , the state of the disc is also fully described by the one - particle distribution function @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of stars in a phase - space element @xmath21 .",
    "since migration is driven by transient spiral arms and other structures much more massive than stars , there is no mass segregation during migration and with no loss of generality we can assume that all stars have the same mass @xmath22 .",
    "the central premise of this paper is that radial migration scrambles the individual angular momenta of disc stars .",
    "ultimately , this will result in a distribution of stars in the @xmath16-dimensional space with coordinates @xmath17 that is uniform on the manifold allowed by the conserved quantities ( the total number of stars and the total angular momentum ; see  [ sec : cons ] ) .",
    "this is simply the ergodic hypothesis that underlies the construction of the microcanonical ensemble in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "then standard arguments show that if @xmath23 and the interactions are weak , the relative probability @xmath24 associated with the distribution function @xmath19 is given by @xmath25 is the boltzmann entropy , and we have set boltzmann s constant to unity .",
    "applying equilibrium statistical mechanics to this problem implicitly assumes that radial migration is efficient enough to completely scramble stellar orbits across the whole radial range of the disc , and does so on a timescale short compared to the age of the galaxy .",
    "we caution that this premise can not be strictly true , since that would produce a stellar disc without abundance or age gradients .",
    "we assume that the number @xmath16 of stars in the disc is fixed ; thus @xmath26 in fact ongoing star formation is present in almost all discs that exhibit the spiral structure that drives migration .",
    "however , by focussing our attention on the distribution of older stars ( e.g. , by measuring the surface - brightness profile at red or infrared wavelengths ) , we can minimize contamination by recent star formation .",
    "we also assume that the total angular momentum @xmath27 of the disc is fixed , thus @xmath28 the validity of this assumption may be limited by several processes .",
    "a central bar can exert torques on the dark halo which drain angular momentum from the disc .",
    "such torques can be substantial but are difficult to estimate because the dark - halo density near the centre of the galaxy is poorly determined ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "typically , however , the effects of bar - halo torques are likely to be small since ( i ) the angular momentum of the bar is much less than that of the disc , because it has only a small fraction of the disc mass and a smaller radius of gyration ; ( ii ) most bars have high pattern speeds @xcite , which suggests that they have not lost much of their original angular momentum .",
    "spiral structure can also transfer angular momentum from the disc to the halo @xcite but for plausible values of the pitch angle and amplitude of the spirals the torques are too small to modify the disc angular momentum significantly .",
    "this would be true even if ( unrealistically ) the strong  grand - design \" spiral patterns seen in some galaxies survived unchanged for a hubble time @xcite .",
    "galaxy discs continuously build up angular momentum as they grow by accretion .",
    "this process violates our assumptions of mass and angular - momentum conservation .",
    "however , as long as radial migration is effective on a timescale shorter than that of the total mass and angular - momentum change due to late - epoch gas infall , the approximations described here remain sensible .    in  [ sec : discussion ] we will discuss the validity of these assumptions in more detail .      the total potential energy of the disc can be written as @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the surface density of the disc at radius @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the gravitational potential due to the dark halo , and the kernel @xmath33 is the gravitational potential between two coplanar rings of unit mass at @xmath31 and @xmath34 ; two expressions for this kernel are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a complete elliptic integral and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the smaller and larger of @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "the gravitational potential in the disc plane is @xmath39 and the kinetic energy of the disc is @xmath40 the surface density is related to the distribution function by @xmath41    we have chosen not to include a constraint that the total disc energy is conserved , for two reasons .",
    "first , spiral structure requires gas in the disc and hence dissipation ; without dissipation , transient spirals heat the disc and quench the formation of further spirals .",
    "thus we do not expect the energy of migrating discs to be conserved .",
    "second , an energy constraint would add an extra free parameter to our models and our intent is to explore the simplest possible models for maximum - entropy discs",
    ".    nevertheless , the disc s total energy does play an important role .",
    "maximum - entropy discs are a possible end - state of migration only if they have lower energy than other discs with the same mass and angular momentum .",
    "we show in the appendix [ sec : h_theorem ] that this is likely to be the case .",
    "the maximum - entropy state consistent with a fixed number of stars @xmath16 and fixed total angular momentum @xmath27 is determined by the variational equation @xmath42 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "the solution to this equation is @xmath45 . substituting back into equations ( [ eq : ndef ] ) and ( [ eq : jdef ] ) it is straightforward to determine @xmath43 and @xmath44 and rewrite the distribution function as @xmath46 the fraction of stars with angular momentum less than @xmath0 is @xmath47 equation or encapsulates a remarkable result : given our assumptions , the maximum - entropy distribution of specific angular momentum of a stellar disc is always exponential , independent of the actual gravitational potential that determines the rotation curve .",
    "we now translate this distribution into surface - density profiles .",
    "to compare the maximum - entropy distribution function to observations for a given rotation curve @xmath3 , we need to relate the surface density @xmath30 to the distribution function @xmath19 .",
    "circular orbits are stable if and only if the angular momentum increases with radius , so @xmath3 defines a bijective mapping between @xmath0and @xmath31 through the equation @xmath48 moreover rotation curves are generally smooth @xcite so the mapping is well - behaved .",
    "we can then compute the surface - density profile from equations ( [ eq : surface_density_ang_mom_distribution ] ) and ( [ eq : dfdefa ] ) , @xmath49\\left[{{\\ensuremath{v_\\mathrm{c}}\\xspace}}(r)+r\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}\\!{{{\\ensuremath{v_\\mathrm{c}}\\xspace}}}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}\\!{r}}}}\\right ] ,      \\label{eq : surface_density}\\ ] ] an alternative form is @xmath50\\left(1+\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}\\!{\\,\\log{{\\ensuremath{v_\\mathrm{c}}\\xspace}}}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{d}\\!{\\,\\log r}}}}\\right ) ,      \\label{eq : surface_density2}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 and @xmath52 the total mass of the disc .",
    "for a flat rotation curve , @xmath53constant , @xmath54 is independent of radius and we have @xmath55 the surface density is an approximately exponential function of radius for @xmath56 , and is @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "alternatively we may ask for what rotation curve the maximum - entropy angular - momentum distribution ( [ eq : dfdefa ] ) has a freeman surface - density distribution , @xmath5 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in this case @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the circular speed at large radii .    in this analysis",
    "we have derived the maximum - entropy surface - density distribution for a given gravitational potential or rotation curve arising from some combination of the disc and dark - halo mass . in appendix",
    "[ sec : self_consistent ] we describe the special case in which there is no halo so the potential is derived self - consistently from the disc mass . in this case",
    "the surface density varies as @xmath61 $ ] at large radii and as @xmath62 at small radii . in principle",
    "one could calculate self - consistently the disc surface - density distribution , the halo density distribution , and the rotation curve resulting from efficient migration , but this is much more difficult , and the result would depend on the initial state of the disc and halo ( see discussion in  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we now ask whether observed surface - density profiles of disc galaxies match the prediction from equations or . to do so we consider the circular - velocity curve , or rotation curve , @xmath3 and the surface - brightness profile @xmath63 for a set of disc - dominated galaxies .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath64is independent of radius so @xmath65 , although the actual value of @xmath64is not needed .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if observations at red ( optical ) bands are available , as population and dust extinction gradients have only modest impact @xcite .",
    "we use a set of 304 disc galaxies with @xmath66-band surface - brightness profiles and h@xmath43 rotation curves from @xcite . @xcite",
    "also provides fitting functions .",
    "there are four fitting parameters , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath44 , but @xmath44 is set to @xmath70 for most of the galaxies .",

    "are there some systematic deviations from the prediction ; these could arise from contamination by bulge components or because our model assumption of circular orbits breaks down at small radii .",
    "note also that a number of _ individual _ galaxies are clearly not consistent with our model , while others show almost perfectly exponential specific angular momentum distributions  this is seen more clearly in figure [ fig : courteau_fit ] .",

    "the contours enclose 30 , 50 , 70 and 90% of the plotted data points .",
    "the red line represents the freeman disc .",
    "the agreement is similar to that of the fit to the angular - momentum distribution in figure [ fig : ang_mom_hist ] . ]    for comparison , in figure [ fig : sb_stack ] we show the stacked surface - brightness profiles from the galaxies in @xcite , rescaled by a fit to the usual freeman disc , @xmath77 .",
    "the overall agreement , and the scatter , are very similar to that of the fit to the angular momentum distribution in figure [ fig : ang_mom_hist ] . a more quantitative comparison in figure [ fig : compare_chi2_scatter ] confirms this result .",
    "a different approach is to use the rotation curve from @xcite to calculate the expected stellar surface density according to equation .",
    "this defines a function with two free parameters , @xmath73  and a normalization constant , which can be fitted to the observed surface - brightness data from @xcite .",
    "we use standard @xmath78-minimization with data points weighted by the inverse error in the surface brightness data ; the innermost data point at @xmath79 is not included in the fit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : courteau_fit ] we show the fits for fifteen galaxies randomly selected from the full sample .",
    "the top panel for each galaxy contains the rotation - curve data ( orange points and error bars ) along with the model 2 fit ( black line ) from @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding surface - brightness data with the best - fit maximum - entropy profile , using the same colour scheme .",
    "a few of the surface - brightness profiles are fitted remarkably well ( e.g. , ugc 10536 ) , and most of the profiles are fit well in the central regions . however , many of the profiles fall below the maximum - entropy fit at large radii , possibly because migration operates slowly at large radii and the disc has not had time to approach a maximum - entropy state . for about one in four of the galaxies , both in figure [ fig : courteau_fit ] and in the full sample of 304 galaxies ,",
    "the profile in the centre is also not reproduced very well .",
    "we may also compare our model to the freeman disc profile .",
    "we have fit the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 for each of the galaxies in the sample , again assuming the same weights ( inverse error ) per @xmath82 . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare_chi2_scatter ] we show a scatter plot of the respective @xmath78 values for the two fits , which each involve two free parameters , a normalization and a scale .",
    "the figure shows that on average the maximum - entropy model and the freeman model fit the data about equally well ; galaxies that fit one model well tend to fit the other and vice versa although there is significant scatter .",
    "the difference is that the freeman model is empirical while the maximum - entropy model is motivated by general properties of the dynamics of disc evolution .",
    "values for fits to a freeman disc ( vertical axis ) and the maximum - entropy model ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the dashed line represents the locus of equal @xmath78values for both models .",
    "@xmath78values have been computed using the inverse of the error of the surface brightness data as weights for each data points .",
    "the average number of degrees of freedom is @xmath83 , and 95% of the galaxies satisfy @xmath84 . the maximum - entropy model and the freeman model fit the data about equally well .",
    "the @xmath78values are generally much larger than the number of degrees of freedom , mostly because of two properties of the surface - brightness profiles of galaxy discs : first , azimuthally averaged profiles often have bumps and wiggles due to spiral structure or other perturbations that are highly significant in a formal sense ; second , profiles often show breaks at small and large radii that can not be captured in the functional forms of either model ( see figure [ fig : courteau_fit ] ) . clearly , the processes that set the disc profiles have aspects that are too complex to be captured by the simple maximum - entropy model . ]",
    "simulations of disc galaxy formation offer a controlled way to test whether galaxy discs evolve towards a maximum - entropy state .",
    "we use the suite of hydrodynamical n - body simulations of @xcite for this purpose .",
    "these simulations use non - cosmological environments , that is , they lack cosmological perturbations such as external torques , mergers , fly - bys , etc .",
    "hence they are well - suited to testing our predictions , which are based on the internal dynamical evolution of the disc ( of course , for the same reasons they are not well - suited for exploring whether internal evolution or cosmological perturbations dominate the disc evolution in real galaxies ) .",
    "the simulations are fully self - consistent and produce @xmath85 galaxies with a range of initial halo spin parameters @xmath86 .",
    "a characteristic of this particular suite of simulations is that the simulated galaxies with low initial halo spin have discs that are dominated by stars on eccentric orbits and those with high initial spin are dominated by stars on nearly circular orbits @xcite .",
    "thus , only the high - spin simulations satisfy our assumption of nearly circular stellar orbits .",
    "for further details about the simulations see @xcite .    for the analysis of the simulations we used the pynbody package @xcite .",
    "we calculate the circular - velocity or rotation curve in the simulations by differentiating the gravitational potential @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we also extract the total stellar mass @xmath89 and the mean specific angular momentum @xmath73of each disc from the simulation . with these data",
    "it is straightforward to predict the surface - density profile of the maximum - entropy disc and to compare this to the actual surface density .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : sim_test ] . for each galaxy",
    "the upper panel shows the circular - velocity curve ( red ) and the mode of the circularity parameter @xmath90 ( grey)-direction to the maximum value possible for a particle with the same energy in this potential ( i.e.,a particle on a circular orbit ) .",
    "thus , it is unity for circular orbits and zero for radial orbits . ] .",
    "the corresponding bottom panels show the surface - density profile as extracted from the simulations ( black points ) and our prediction for a maximum - entropy model ( red line ) .",
    "note that these predictions have no adjustable parameters , although our procedure guarantees that the total mass and angular momentum of the maximum - entropy disc matches those of the simulated disc .    for almost all galaxies the inner part of the surface - density profile ( inside the half - mass radius )",
    "is reproduced nicely by our model . in the outer part of the disc",
    "the agreement gets progressively better with increasing values for the halo spin parameter @xmath86 ; the agreement for the lowest spin galaxy ( @xmath91 ) is poor in the outer region , while for the highest spin simulation ( @xmath92 ) our prediction follows the actual profile closely over the entire radial range .",
    "the lower spin simulations might not represent realistic disc dominated galaxies , as their orbits are far from circular even at large radii @xcite .",
    "we infer that the maximum - entropy model provides a remarkably good match to the surface - density profiles of simulated disc galaxies with near - circular orbits ( or realistic radial velocity dispersions ) .",
    "using arguments from equilibrium statistical mechanics we have derived an analytic expression for the stellar surface - density profiles of disc galaxies .",
    "the profile of these  maximum - entropy \" discs depends only on the underlying rotation curve and the total stellar mass and angular momentum .",
    "the derivation rests on several idealized assumptions :    * the disc is axisymmetric , thin , and cold , in the sense that the stellar orbits are nearly circular and coplanar ; * the total mass and angular momentum of the stars are conserved ( i.e.,negligible ongoing star formation , mass loss or accretion , exchange of angular momentum with the halo , etc . ) ; * there is a radial mixing mechanism that is efficient enough to distribute the stars uniformly on the phase - space manifold allowed by the conserved quantities .",
    "these are strong assumptions that certainly over - simplify the physics of real disc galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown in  [ sec : simulation_test ] that our model correctly predicts the surface - density profiles of simulated galaxies , at least for isolated discs that are dominated by stars on nearly circular orbits .",
    "we have compared the surface - density distribution in maximum - entropy discs to the profiles of 304 disc - dominated galaxies from @xcite .",
    "this comparison requires deriving the angular momentum vs.  radius relation and fitting the model to the total angular momentum and mass of the observed discs .",
    "we found that overall our maximum - entropy model fits about as well as a freeman disc @xcite , an empirical formula chosen to match the observations that has the same number ( 2 ) of free parameters .",
    "only a few of the galaxies were completely incompatible with maximum - entropy models ; the majority of the galaxies show a qualitatively sensible fit ; and a significant fraction of galaxies yield excellent consistency .",
    "we deem this match encouraging , as it suggests that the physics in our extremely simple and restrictive model plays an important role in determining the radial profiles of galaxy discs .",
    "it is worth reviewing the simplifying assumptions and approximations that we made when comparing the model to observations , which we now do .",
    "we have assumed that the disc stars are on circular , coplanar orbits , i.e. , that the disc is cold and razor - thin .",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation : for edge - on disc galaxies the scale height normal to the disc midplane is approximately independent of radius and only @xmath93 of the scale length @xmath81 of the freeman model that characterizes the radial distribution of mass in the disc @xcite .",
    "the typical radial velocity dispersion @xmath94 in galaxy discs at @xmath81 is estimated to be only 30% of the circular speed @xmath95 in external galaxies @xcite and the ratio @xmath96 is even smaller at larger radii ( in the solar neighbourhood the ratio is @xmath97 ) .",
    "however , these approximations are less good close to the centre of the galaxy and the comparison of the maximum - entropy model with simulations in  [ sec : simulation_test ] suggests that it breaks down when the assumption of near - circular orbits is not met ( see also figure [ fig : sim_test ] ) .",
    "this is a strong hint that the assumption of circular orbits is necessary .    to explore the effects of relaxing this assumption",
    "we may allow the stars to have small but non - zero radial and vertical actions @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "since these are adiabatic invariants they should be conserved by the slow interactions with transient spirals that drive migration . in this case the maximum - entropy distribution function is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the initial distribution of the disc stars in @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "a more realistic approximation is to include slow growth in @xmath98 and @xmath99 due to scattering by giant molecular clouds and non - corotating spiral arms .",
    "implementing these generalizations would be straightforward but we have not done so in this paper .",
    "we also note that the migration efficiency decreases as @xmath98 and @xmath99 increase @xcite and it is possible , for example , that the disc is close to a maximum - entropy state only for stars on near - circular orbits",
    ".    in a strict sense ongoing star formation in discs and infall of halo gas and minor mergers must violate our assumption of total mass and angular - momentum conservation .",
    "nonetheless , this approximation may be sensible for our purposes .",
    "it is natural to assume that the timescales for mass ( @xmath102 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath103 ) buildup are similar , @xmath104 . then if the migration time @xmath105 the disc will always be close to a maximum - entropy state although the surface - density profile of this state will vary on a timescale @xmath106 .    in a true maximum - entropy disk",
    "there should be no radial age or metallicity gradients .",
    "consequently , there is some tension between our simple model and observations of metallicity and age gradients in disc galaxies .",
    "however , not all disc galaxies have significant gradients and those that do generally show only shallow gradients @xcite , which could persist even if the discs were close to maximum entropy .",
    "moreover the youngest stellar populations are the brightest and therefore tend to dominate observed abundance gradients : only stars with ages much longer than the migration time are expected to have a maximum - entropy distribution and indeed the metallicity gradient in the milky way appears to be smaller for older stars @xcite . in general , the maximum - entropy disc profile with no gradients can be considered an asymptotic solution , which the discs approach but may not yet have achieved @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that substantial radial mixing has occurred in the milky way . in the galaxy",
    ", there is a mild , but significant radial abundance gradient among the young stars ( @xmath107  gyr ) , with only a small dispersion in [ fe / h ] at any given radius @xcite . but the dispersion in [ fe / h ] at any given radius is much larger for stars having ages of a few gyrs @xcite , arguing for strong radial migration .",
    "additional evidence for migration is the exceptionally low metallicities of some nearby molecular clouds , and the high metallicity of the sun compared to the average metallicity of the local interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for migration is harder to find in other galaxies , although @xcite found azimuthal variations in chemical abundances in the sc galaxy gc 6754 which are consistent with large - scale radial migration along the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "our arguments so far assume the existence of a radial mixing process that preserves circular , coplanar orbits ( i.e. , preserves the radial and vertical actions of the orbits ) .",
    "radial migration due to transient spirals is an attractive candidate for this process , since it can transport stars radially on timescales less than the hubble time and preserves radial actions when the dominant gravitational torques on the stars arise from mass distributions that nearly corotate with them @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of other plausible mechanisms in disc galaxies that can shuffle circular , coplanar orbits effectively .",
    "in general we have computed the distribution of angular momentum or mass in a maximum - entropy disc in a given gravitational potential or rotation curve , without asking whether the potential arises from the disc or halo mass distribution , or what determines the halo mass distribution .",
    "the only exception is appendix [ sec : self_consistent ] , in which we numerically computed the self - consistent surface - density profile for an isolated razor - thin disc that is not embedded in a dark halo ; however , such a galaxy is not possible in the current standard @xmath108cdm model of cosmology , in which galaxies form from cooling baryons in the potential well of their host halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    "both the mass distribution and the rotation curve in maximum - entropy discs could be determined by following the response of the halo to slow changes in the stellar disc configuration @xcite . however , the result would depend on the initial state of the dark halo and the disc as well as cosmological effects such as gas infall and mergers .",
    "thus , although the angular - momentum distribution in a maximum - entropy disc must have the simple form , the rotation curve and surface - density distribution will depend on the initial conditions and the cosmological context .    in low - mass disc galaxies the validity of our model might be impaired by several effects : ( i ) the assumption of circular and coplanar orbits for the stars is less good in dwarf galaxies , because the turbulent velocities in the interstellar medium are a larger fraction of the circular speed ; ( ii ) transient spirals develop most vigorously in strongly shearing disks ; low - luminosity galaxies generally have rising rotation curves , and therefore weaker spiral activity than more massive galaxies ( j.  sellwood , private communication ) ; ( iii ) stellar feedback can alter the gravitational potential and hence the rotation curve by suddenly expelling significant portions of gas on timescales much less than the migration time @xcite ; more massive galaxies have deeper gravitational potential wells and are less susceptible to this process @xcite .",
    "we have described a simple and natural model for the end - state of radial migration in galaxy discs , which leads to an exponential distribution of angular momentum . given the rotation curve ,",
    "this model provides a straightforward prediction of the expected surface - brightness profile , which fits observed and simulated galaxy discs about as well as the well - established empirical freeman model ( exponential surface brightness ) .",
    "our model is based on the simple _ ansatz _ that the angular momenta of disc stars are completely shuffled on timescales short compared to the galaxy age , so the disc entropy is maximized subject to idealized but physically well - motivated constraints .",
    "the derivation is analogous to that of the boltzmann distribution for ideal gases .",
    "our model stands in stark contrast to many previous analytical attempts to explain the profiles of galaxy discs , which assume that they are either a consequence of the initial conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , viscous evolution of a gas disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , scattering by interstellar clouds @xcite , or a combination of these processes @xcite .",
    "the assumption of strong migration is consistent with the relatively weak age and metallicity gradients seen in galaxy discs .",
    "of course , discs with even weak population gradients can not be actually in a maximum - entropy state : the scrambling due to migration can not be complete , but the migration appears to be efficient enough that their surface - brightness profiles are fit fairly well by this model .",

    "here we argue that maximum - entropy discs will generally have lower energy than other discs with the same mass and angular momentum .",
    "we model migration by a fokker ",
    "planck equation of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the time - dependent distribution function and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are diffusion coefficients that parametrize the migration rate . since migration is due to transient spirals or other mass concentrations that are much more massive than the stars , the diffusion coefficients satisfy a fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath113 so the fokker  planck equation simplifies to a diffusion equation of the form @xmath114 this evolution equation conserves the total number of stars if there is no mass current through the origin or at infinity , @xmath115 as @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "we conclude that in galaxy discs that do not have pathological rotation curves migration leads to higher entropy and lower energy states .",

    "this angular - momentum density distribution is present in two distinct surface - density distributions @xcite : ( i ) cored discs , in which the surface density @xmath139 near the origin and the angular speed @xmath140 is also constant ; ( ii ) mestel - type discs , in which @xmath141 and the circular speed @xmath142 is constant .",
