    "motivated by the lsnd observation of an excess of observed @xmath5 events above background prediction in a @xmath6 beam  @xcite , the miniboone experiment was designed to test the neutrino oscillation interpretation of the lsnd signal in both neutrino and anti - neutrino modes .",
    "the miniboone collaboration has performed a search for @xmath7 oscillations with @xmath8 protons on target ( pot ) , the results of which showed no evidence of an excess of @xmath9 events for neutrino energies above 475 mev  @xcite . despite having observed no evidence for oscillations above 475 mev , the miniboone @xmath10 search observed an excess of 128.8@xmath243.4 events at low energy , between 200 - 475 mev  @xcite .",
    "although the excess is incompatible with lsnd - type oscillations within the simple two neutrino oscillation framework , several hypotheses , including sterile neutrino oscillations with cp violation , anomaly - mediated neutrino - photon coupling , and many others , have been proposed that provide a possible explanation for the excess itself  @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "these theories offer the possibility of reconciling the miniboone @xmath9 excess with the lsnd @xmath5 excess .",
    "a search in antineutrino mode provides a more direct test of the lsnd signal , which was observed with antineutrinos .",
