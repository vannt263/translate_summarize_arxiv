    "since the early days of quantum mechanics the crossover to the classical world and the possibility that macroscopic objects could exhibit quantum behavior has attracted continuous interest .",
    "the tremendous progress in nano - fabrication capabilities have made these questions amenable to experimental testing .",
    "stimulated by the ideas of leggett  @xcite , macroscopic quantum effects were first explored in josephson junctions  @xcite and nano - magnets  @xcite . in the recent past ,",
    "the field of nano electromechanical systems ( nems ) has received much attention as a very promising ground for the investigation of these questions  @xcite and the observation of a mechanical oscillator in its quantum ground state  @xcite is one of the most important achievements reached so far .",
    "the coupling of a quantum nano - mechanical oscillator to a qubit makes nems also suitable systems to explore the physics of circuit / cavity - qed  @xcite .",
    "different schemes have been proposed including coupling to cooper - pair boxes  @xcite and phase qubits  @xcite .",
    "recently , coupling to a cooper - pair box has been realized experimentally  @xcite . among the numerous interesting aspects of circuit - qed realized with mechanical resonators , here we want to address the phenomenon of _ phonon blockade _ , which was considered recently in ref .  , extending to nems the original ideas put forward with photons in cavity - qed systems  @xcite .",
    "the blockade effect arises because the coherent coupling of the harmonic ( photonic / phononic ) mode with the ( solid - state ) atom leads to an effective non - linearity . for sufficiently strong coupling ,",
    "the non - linearity is such that , upon external driving , the number of excitations of the oscillator never exceeds one .",
    "observation of phonon blockade in a nano - mechanical oscillator would be a clear evidence of its quantum nature .    .",
    "the first excited states are the maximally entangled bell states @xmath0 and are off resonance with the states with more than one excitation .",
    "when the system is excited at the frequency @xmath1 , phonon blockade is observed through the photon statistics . ]",
    "there is , however , an important challenge which needs to be tackled towards the demonstration of phonon blockade : its detection .",
    "the motion of a mechanical oscillator close to its ground state is tiny and strong amplification of the transduced signals must be applied . on the other hand",
    ", amplification will inevitably add classical correlations to the signal , thus disguising quantum correlations which are usually needed for demonstrating phonon blockade .    in this article",
    "we show that these problems may be overcome if a superconducting microwave resonator ( smr ) is coupled linearly to the mechanical oscillator for transducing its motion into an electric signal .",
    "smrs have proven to be nearly ideal quantum oscillators with easily tunable quality factors and they can be efficiently coupled to coherent quantum circuits  @xcite . our analysis is amenable to experimental verification .",
    "recently , good coupling of a nano - mechanical resonator and a smr has been demonstrated  @xcite . moreover , despite the difficulties in dealing with a microwave field at the level of a single photon , recently it has been shown that time correlation functions for the cavity field can be measured accurately  @xcite .",
    "very recently , microwave photon blockade has been realized and measured experimentally  @xcite .",
    "our detection scheme takes fully advantage of the experimental capabilities of the smr to probe the quantum state of the mechanical resonator with a linear coupling .",
    "the hybrid phonon - photon system that we analyze in this work goes beyond a mere detection scheme for the phonon blockade . in the second part we present the properties of this _",
    "phonotonic junction_. for a mechanical oscillator initially driven in an exited state we show that two regimes exist , depending on the ratio between the anharmonicity and the coupling compared to a critical value . for a small coupling ,",
    "the phonons are trapped in the mechanical oscillator whereas coherent oscillations between the phonons and the photons appear when increasing the coupling , leading to quantum revivals in the photon statistics .",
    "we show that this transition can be induced by the dissipation and take place during the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model for the system depicted in fig.[figsystemspectrum ] and introduce the equations governing its dynamics in the presence of damping . in section  [ phonoblockade ]",
    "we discuss how to detect phonon blockade by means of a measurement of the photon statistics . in section  [ phonotonic ]",
    "we present the properties of this phonotonic junction with the transition between a self - trapping regime and a regime with coherent oscillations .",
    "we summarize our results in the concluding section .",
    "the system we have in mind is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figsystemspectrum ] .",
    "it is a mechanical resonator coupled capacitively to an artificial atom and a smr .",
    "the non - linearity , leading to phonon blockade , is induced by coupling the oscillator to a superconducting qubit . in the case of a cooper - pair box ,",
    "one gets the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "a cooper - pair box molecule  @xcite may be considered as well in order to increase the non - linearity . in the present work , however , we do not deal with a specific choice of the superconducting nano - circuit ; the important ingredient is the generation of the kerr hamiltonian proportional to @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the phonon annihilation and creation operators of the mechanical oscillators .",
    "after the adiabatic elimination of the qubit , the non - linear mechanical resonator ( nmr ) is described by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath5 the mechanical resonator is supposed to be in the quantum regime ( the bare frequency is in the ghz range ) . for a strong coupling of hundreds of mhz ,",
    "the kerr non - linearity strength @xmath6 is of the order of mhz .",
    "the coupling between the nmr and the smr is obtained from circuit theory .",
    "the cavity is modeled by an array of @xmath7 circuits  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fundamental mode of the smr is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mode frequency and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) the corresponding photon annihilation ( creation ) operator .",
    "the mechanical resonator is kept at a fixed potential @xmath12 with respect to ground and the coupling is realized through a localized capacitance @xmath13 , resulting in two coupling terms in the hamiltonian : a radiation pressure term @xmath14 and a linear term @xmath15 , coming from the electrostatic energy of the coupling capacitor ( @xmath16 is the root mean square of the zero - point voltage fluctuation of the smr at the position of the coupling capacitance ) .",
    "these two terms can have very different orders of magnitude for typical values of @xmath12 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the case where the gate voltage is much larger than the root mean square of the voltage quantum fluctuations inside the smr , and thus neglect radiation pressure . in the rotating wave approximation",
    ", the coupling reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 . for realistic parameters ,",
    "the coupling may be of the order of mhz .",
    "the mechanical resonator is driven by a weak oscillating current , at the frequency @xmath19 , in the presence of a static magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the circuit .",
    "this driving is modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath20 where the strength @xmath21 is proportional to the current amplitude and the magnetic field . driving the mechanical oscillator can in principle act as a direct driving also for the smr through the capacitive and inductive couplings . however , the resulting driving is negligible .",
    "indeed , on the one hand because the displacement is tiny the electromotive force induced in the smr is well below @xmath16 and on the other hand for spatially separated resonators the mutual inductance is suppressed .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the working point at @xmath23 .",
    "the mode frequency of the cavity can be tuned by adding a squid at the end of one arm to change the boundary condition  @xcite . in the rotating frame of the driving ,",
    "the total hamiltonian reads @xmath24 a linear coupling between driven non - linear oscillators can also be obtained in cavity - qed  @xcite .",
    "the finite lifetime of the phonons and the photons is taken into account through the lindblad operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the resonator and the cavity , respectively  @xcite ( @xmath27 is the density matrix of the whole system )    @xmath28    where the damping rates @xmath29 are the inverse of the phonon and photon lifetime and are defined by the quality factors @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is then governed by the master equation @xmath31 + l\\rho(t ) , \\label{meq}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the total lindbladian .    in principle , some noise is introduced by the voltage source used to keep the mechanical resonator at @xmath12 . however , following ref .  , the dominant lindblad operator corresponding to this source of noise for the case of a markovian environment is found to be of the order of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the internal resistance of the voltage source ) , which is negligible due to the very small value of @xmath35 . in the case of slow voltage fluctuations",
    ", one can also neglect noise effects , as we discuss below .",
    "blockade is possible only if the non - linearity of the energy spectrum is larger than the state linewidth , namely @xmath36 .",
    "this condition imposes the quality factors to be at least several thousand , which is within the experimental capabilities . throughout the present work we chose the following parameters for the numerical simulations : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "[ figq ] shows that the results are still valid for quality factors @xmath42 , when the damping becomes of the order of the coupling .",
    "moreover , the nmr is driven at the resonance @xmath43 with the amplitude @xmath44 . by analyzing the time traces of the photon and phonon populations ( not shown here )",
    "it is possible to note that the cavity closely resembles the dynamics of the nmr , with equal steady state phonon and photon numbers close to @xmath45 .",
    "the population of the state with two phonons or two photons is strongly suppressed , implying both phonon and photon blockade . in the rest of the paper",

    "<S> measuring the quantum dynamics of a mechanical system , when few phonons are involved , remains a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a superconducting microwave resonator linearly coupled to the mechanical mode constitutes a very powerful probe for this scope </S>",
    "<S> . this new coupling can be much stronger than the usual radiation pressure interaction by adjusting a gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the detection of phonon blockade , showing that it can be observed by measuring the statistics of the light in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying reason is the formation of an entangled state between the two resonators . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme realizes a phonotonic josephson junction , giving rise to coherent oscillations between phonons and photons as well as a self - trapping regime for a coupling smaller than a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the self - trapping to the oscillating regime is also induced dynamically by dissipation . </S>"
