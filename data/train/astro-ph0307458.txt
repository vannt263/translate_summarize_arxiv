    "to fully understand the behavior of black hole candidate ( bhc ) x - ray transients , it is important to determine the source properties for the full range of observed x - ray luminosities from outburst peak at @xmath8 erg  s@xmath1 to quiescence at @xmath9 erg  s@xmath1 . the brighter part of this range has been well - studied by several satellites , and , due to its broad bandpass ( 2 - 200 kev ) and its excellent timing capabilities , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ , bradt , rothschild & swank 1993 ) has proved to be an extremely useful tool for studying the luminosity range above @xmath10@xmath11 erg  s@xmath1 ( for sources with typical distances of 3 - 10  kpc ) . for most systems , this is below the luminosity where the source makes a transition from the canonical high - soft state to the low - hard ( or hard ) state @xcite , and our group as well as others have used _ rxte _ to study bhc transients as they undergo soft - to - hard state transitions during outburst decay @xcite . however , as _ rxte _ is not an imaging instrument , background and source confusion become significant at lower luminosities , making both spectral and timing studies problematic .",
    "thus , at low luminosities , imaging observatories such as _ bepposax _ , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite , and _ xmm - newton _ are necessary , and these satellites have been used to study bhc transients in quiescence @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to use _ chandra _ to study the evolution of xte j1650500 in the luminosity range between the transition to the hard state and quiescence .",
    "few previous studies have been dedicated to observing bhc transients at luminosities between the hard state transition and quiescence even though the source evolution has not been well - characterized , and the physical changes that occur in this regime are unclear .",
    "the results of the studies of bhc transients that have been undertaken in this regime are intriguing .",
    "a correlation between x - ray and radio flux has been found for several bhc systems in the hard state @xcite , and this has been interpreted as evidence for a connection between x - ray production and a compact radio jet @xcite . as the sources decay , it has been observed that the x - ray energy spectra maintain a power - law shape ; however , in some cases , there is evidence for spectral evolution with sources becoming softer at low luminosities @xcite .",
    "x - ray timing studies immediately after the hard state transition show that , in most cases , the characteristic frequencies drop @xcite , and this may indicate movement of the inner edge of the optically thick accretion disk away from the black hole . however , for the most part , the x - ray timing studies have not extended to luminosities much below the hard state transition .",
    "the hard state accretion geometry , the emission mechanisms , and the connection between the accreting material and the compact jet outflow that is present in the hard state for at least some bhcs @xcite are all currently active areas of debate .",
    "several theoretical models have been suggested .",
    "one possibility is that a quasi - spherical , optically thin region forms in the inner portion of the accretion flow as in advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is predominantly due to thermal comptonization in the hard state for adaf models and for more generic `` sphere+disk '' models , and some success has been achieved in comparing such models to observations @xcite . however , for a range of disk viscosities , the adaf model is convectively unstable @xcite , and this should be considered before concluding that any adaf or sphere+disk model provides the correct physical description .",
    "another possibility that implies a much different site for x - ray production and a different accretion geometry is that the x - ray emission is due to magnetic flares above the disk @xcite . although the presence of a jet is not incorporated into the basic models described above , some recent work describes how a jet may arise from a `` magnetic corona '' @xcite .",
    "other models have focused on the emission from the compact jet , and one suggestion is that the x - ray emission is produced in the jet via a synchrotron mechanism @xcite .",
    "improving the luminosity coverage for the hard state is important for providing tests of these models .",
    "in addition , it is currently unclear whether the same physical model can apply to these systems in the hard state and in quiescence . major physical changes to the system",
    "could be seen as another state transition at very low luminosities . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of a sharp transition could indicate that quiescence is simply a low luminosity extension of the hard state as has been previously suggested for gx 3394 @xcite .",
    "we chose to carry out our program by observing xte j1650500 .",
    "this was a new bhc transient when it was discovered in outburst in 2001 @xcite .",
    "although the compact object mass is not well - constrained so that it has not been confirmed that this is a black hole system , its x - ray properties strongly suggest that it harbors a black hole @xcite . during its outburst ,",
    "the source was optically identified @xcite , and a radio counterpart was found @xcite . in quiescence ,",
    "a radial velocity study was carried out , indicating a binary orbital period of 5.1  hr and an optical mass function of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the value for the mass function is relatively low for a black hole system and could indicate that the system contains a relatively low mass black hole , has a low binary inclination ( @xmath13 ) , or both .",
    "we previously reported on _ rxte _ observations of xte j1650500 , including a study of its timing properties near the soft - to - hard state transition @xcite .",
    "we also reported on 14 day x - ray oscillations and @xmath10100  s x - ray flares that were detected with _",
    "rxte _ near the end of the outburst @xcite .",
    "the current work focuses on our studies of the source with _",
    "we obtained 3 _ chandra _ observations of xte j1650500 near the end of its 2001 - 2002 outburst , and the times of the observations are marked on the long - term x - ray light curve shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we compiled the 3 - 20 kev light curve in figure  [ fig : lc ] using all the observations of xte j1650500 that were made with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rxte_. the 3 _ chandra _ observations were made 67 , 78 , and 104 days after the soft - to - hard state transition @xcite , during the time when the source was exhibiting large - amplitude flux oscillations with a characteristic time scale of 14 days @xcite .",
    "all 3 observations were made at flux levels well below the level of the soft - to - hard state transition .",
    "the _ chandra _ observations were made using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) . in each case , the source was placed on one of the back - illuminated acis chips ( s3 ) .",
    "the first two observations ( 1 and 2 ) , were made with the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) inserted , and each observation lasted approximately 10  ks ( see table  [ tab : obs ] for exact times and other detailed information about the observations ) . to increase the throughput ,",
    "the grating was not used for observation 3 , making photon pile - up @xcite a concern . to mitigate the effects of pile - up , we reduced the ccd exposure time from 0.4  s per frame from the nominal 3.2  s per frame by using a 1/8 ccd sub - array .",
    "in addition , the telescope was pointed @xmath14 away from the target , slightly blurring the point spread function ( psf ) for xte j1650500 .",
    "an exposure time of 18  ks was obtained for observation 3 .",
    "in addition to the _ chandra _ observations , shorter 1.8 - 2.4  ks _ rxte _ observations were co - ordinated to cover part of each _ chandra _ observation .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      for the two grating observations , we used the `` level 2 '' event list produced by the standard data processing ( ascds v6.5.1 using caldb v2.11 ) .",
    "for both observations , we applied a standard correction to the acis - s4 chip to correct a flaw in the chip readout .",
    "for this , as well as the data processing described below , we used the ciao ( _ chandra interactive analysis of observations _ ) v2.3 software and caldb ( calibration data base ) v2.21 . prior to extracting the grating spectra , we produced background light curves .",
    "for observation 1 only , we found a few background flares where the count rate increased by 50 - 100% for a time period of less than 50  s. due to their short duration , the flares make only a small contribution to the total background .",
    "thus , we did not remove these times in the subsequent analysis , and the full integration time was used for both observations .    for observations 1 and 2",
    ", we produced 0.3 - 8 kev zero order images .",
    "we used the source detection algorithm _",
    "wavdetect _ to search for sources in a 2 by 2 arcminute region around the _ chandra _ aim - point , and we only detect the target in each case . the observation 1 and 2 source positions are consistent with one another , and we obtain a mean source position of r.a .",

    "this position is consistent with the previously reported radio @xcite and optical @xcite positions , and we note that the _ chandra _ position is somewhat more accurate than the @xmath19 and @xmath20 radio and optical positions , respectively . we conclude that the detected source is indeed xte j1650500 . given the recent detections of x - ray jets from xte j1550564 @xcite and 4u 1755338 @xcite , we examined the xte j1650500 images for x - ray extensions in the vicinity of the source , but we do not see any features that are likely to be jets",
    ". using the zero order acis response matrix and a spectral shape similar to that observed for the xte j1550564 jet ( @xmath21 with interstellar absorption ) , the upper limit on the 0.3 - 8 kev absorbed flux is @xmath22 erg  @xmath23  s@xmath1 at positions @xmath24 from xte j1650500 .",
    "we used the ciao routine _ tgextract _ for the extraction of grating spectra and the ciao routines _ mkgrmf _ and _ mkgarf _ to produce response matrices . combining the + 1 and @xmath25 meg ( medium energy grating ) 0.7 - 7 kev spectra yields 4786 counts in 10001 seconds for observation 1 and 4342 counts in 9509 seconds for observation 2 .",
    "for the + 1 and @xmath25 heg ( high energy grating ) 1 - 9 kev spectra , there are 2706 counts and 1872 counts for observations 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we also produced estimated background spectra ; however , we find that the background is not significant with estimates of @xmath1020 counts for the meg and @xmath1011 counts for the heg ( 0.4% of the detected counts in both cases ) . the higher meg and heg orders contain between @xmath1030 and @xmath10200 counts ( source plus background ) . for each observation ,",
    "the zeroth order contains @xmath102500 counts , but there is a high level of photon pile - up .",
    "the flux obtained from the grating spectra implies that the number of counts would be a factor of 3 higher without photon pile - up .",
    "thus , due to the low number of counts in grating orders 2 and 3 and the high level of pile - up in the zeroth order , we focus on the order 1 spectra in this work . a final step in the extraction of the spectra",
    "is to apply a correction to the response matrix to account for the gradually changing low energy acis response .",
    "we used the script _ corrarf _ to apply this correction .",
    "for observation 3 , we used the `` level 2 '' event list produced by the standard data processing ( ascds v6.6.0 and caldb v2.12 ) . after inspecting an image including the full energy band",
    ", we produced a 0.3 - 8 kev image to reduce the background level .",
    "with the 1/8 sub - array and only the s3 chip active , the field of view is approximately @xmath26 by @xmath27 ( 128 by 1024 pixels ) , and we used _",
    "wavdetect _ to search for sources .",
    "we found 4 sources detected at greater than 4-@xmath28 significance .",
    "the brightest source by far is at a position consistent with the xte j1650500 position found above for the grating observations .",
    "although xte j1650500 appears to be elongated , we used ciao to simulate an off - axis psf , and we found that xte j1650500 is consistent with a point - like source .",
    "the other 3 sources also appear to be point - like , and the closest source is more than @xmath26 from xte j1650500 . despite using an instrument setup designed to mitigate pile - up , the measured acis count rate of 0.493  s@xmath1 for xte j1650500 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) indicates that the data at the psf core is moderately affected by photon pile - up .",
    "however , we were still able to use this data for spectral and timing analysis as described below and in appendix a.      we initially performed spectral and timing analysis for the 3 _ rxte _ observations that were made during the _ chandra _ observations . using the `` standard 2 '' pca data , we extracted energy spectra using scripts developed at uc san diego and the university of tbingen that incorporate the standard software for _ rxte _ data reduction ( ftools v5.2 ) .",
    "we used the 2002 february release of the `` faint source '' model for background subtraction .",
    "obtaining the best possible background subtraction is important for this work because of the low source count rates . to achieve this , we used standard 2 data from the top anode layer only and excluded data from pcu 0 , which has a higher background level due to the loss of its propane layer .",
    "in addition to the 3 _ rxte _ observations , we extracted energy spectra for the final 8 observations for which the pca count rates are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "for these observations , the mean 5 - 8 kev pca count rate is @xmath29 s@xmath1 per proportional counter unit ( pcu ) using all three anode layers , indicating that the rate is consistent with zero at slightly more than the 1-@xmath28 level .",
    "we determined this rate in order to make a comparison to the rate expected from the galactic ridge emission at the galactic latitude of xte j1650500 ( @xmath30 ) . @xcite",
    "have determined the level of galactic ridge emission ( in pca count rate ) averaged over galactic longitude as a function of @xmath31 ( see figure  2 of valinia & marshall 1998 ) .",
    "they found that the distribution could be described by narrow and broad gaussian components , and only the broad gaussian contributes at the galactic latitude of xte j1650500 . using the parameters for",
    "the broad gaussian leads to a best estimate of the 5 - 8 kev galactic ridge rate of 0.71 s@xmath1 for all anode layers and 5 pcus .",
    "scaling the observed count rate given above ( 0.021  s@xmath1 ) to 5 pcus gives @xmath32 s@xmath1 , which is significantly below the best estimate for the galactic ridge emission .",
    "thus , we conclude that the galactic ridge emission can easily explain the low level of emission we detect for the final 8 observations .",
    "as this analysis shows that it is likely that xte j1650500 does not contribute to the flux detected during these observations , we produced an average spectrum ( top anode layer only ) for the final 8 observations and subtracted it from the pca spectra for the 3 _ rxte _ observations that were simultaneous with the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the effect to the continuum is small ; however , the galactic ridge emission contains a strong iron emission line at 6.7 kev , and this line is apparent in the average spectrum for the final 8 observations .    finally , we analyzed the data from the 15 _ rxte _ observations taken between mjd 52265 and mjd 52298 , which is after the gap in _ rxte _ coverage and before the _ chandra _ observations began ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "we processed the pca data as described above , including the subtraction of the galactic ridge emission from the energy spectrum .",
    "for the spectral analysis described in   3.3 , we also removed flares from 2 of the observations as described in @xcite .",
    "using xspec 11.2 , we performed simultaneous least - squares fits to the _ chandra _ and pca spectra for all three observations . for the pca , we included 0.6% and 0.3% systematic errors for energy bins below and above 8  kev , respectively , as described in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we began by fitting the observation 1 spectrum with a power - law with interstellar absorption .",
    "we also included a constant factor to allow for the possibility that the overall normalization is different for the pca and _ chandra _ , but we assumed that the overall meg and heg normalizations agree with each other .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : spec ] , a power - law model with @xmath2 and @xmath33 @xmath23 ( errors are 90% confidence , @xmath34 ) provides a good fit to the spectrum ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the other continuum models we tried do not provide acceptable fits .",
    "thermal models , such as a blackbody or a disk - blackbody @xcite , result in reduced @xmath36 values of 8.4 and 2.3 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] shows the observation 1 spectrum and residuals with the power - law fit .",
    "no clear features are seen in the residuals , and we note that the fit is not improved by adding a soft component , a high energy cutoff , or an iron emission line .",
    "the upper limit on the equivalent width of a narrow ( where `` narrow '' is set by the binning shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] ) fe k@xmath37 emission line at 6.4  kev is 161  ev .    .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1],scaledwidth=30.0% ]    table  [ tab : obs ] and figure  [ fig : lc ] indicate that the count rates are very similar for observations 1 and 2 .",
    "we fitted the observation 2 spectrum , and table  [ tab : spec ] shows that the spectral parameters do not change significantly between the two observations .",
    "also , in both cases , the spectral fits indicate that the pca/_chandra _ normalization factor is near 1.12 .",
    "as the pca exposure only covers part of the _ chandra _ observation , we checked to see if this difference could be due to source variability .",
    "we extracted a grating spectrum for observation 1 that is strictly simultaneous with the pca exposure . during this time",
    ", the meg count rate is @xmath38 s@xmath1 ( 0.7 - 7 kev ) , which is consistent with the rate for the full observation ( @xmath39 s@xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the overall normalizations are different for the pca and the _ chandra _ gratings , and we note that this is not surprising since it has been previously determined that the pca normalization is high relative to previous instruments @xcite .    due to the presence of photon pile - up in the psf core , we extracted the observation 3 acis spectrum after removing the counts detected in the psf core .",
    "we extracted the source counts from an elliptical annulus centered on the xte j1650500 position .",
    "we used an inner ellipse with a semi - major axis of @xmath40 and a semi - minor axis of @xmath41 , and an outer ellipse with a semi - major axis of @xmath42 and a semi - minor axis of @xmath43 .",
    "we rotated the ellipses to match the off - axis _",
    "chandra _ psf .",
    "this region contains 1573 counts compared to the 9000 counts obtained when the core is included ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , and we are confident that the photons from the elliptical annulus do not suffer from pile - up . however , it is critical to realize that acis response matrices produced by the standard ciao software do not account for the size or shape of the source extraction region or the fact that the _ chandra _ psf is energy dependent .",
    "we corrected the acis response matrix for this using the _ chandra _ ray tracing software ( chart ) as described in appendix b. when producing the response matrix we also applied the low energy acis response correction for detector evolution as described above for the grating spectra .",
    "we fitted the observation 3 acis+pca spectrum with an absorbed power - law model as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum3 ] .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the data ( @xmath44 ) with parameter values of @xmath45 @xmath23 and @xmath3 ( see table  [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "the measured column density is consistent with the value obtained from the grating observations .",
    "thus , we re - fitted the spectrum after fixing the column density to the value found using the grating spectra ( @xmath46 @xmath23 ) , and we obtain @xmath47 . also , for consistency with observations 1 and 2 , we used the pca normalization for observation 3 divided by the pca / grating normalization factor of 1.12 to determine the observation 3 flux reported in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the spectral results indicate that the xte j1650500 keeps its power - law shape but softens somewhat at low luminosity .    .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals .",
    "[ fig : spectrum3],scaledwidth=30.0% ]      we examined the pca and _ chandra _ light curves for all three observations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lc2 ] , clear variability is present in the pca light curves for observations 1 and 2 and in the acis light curve for observation 3 .",
    "the plotted 3 - 20 kev pca light curves ( panels a and b ) have 4  s time bins , and we note that the count rate is higher than reported in table  [ tab : obs ] because we used all anode layers and pcus 0 , 2 , and 3 rather than just the top layer and pcus 2 and 3 . while the quality of the background estimate is slightly worse when pcu 0 and all layers are included , the higher count rate allows for tighter constraints on the timing properties .",
    "we also produced grating light curves ( meg+heg ) for observations 1 and 2 .",
    "although the statistical quality of the pca light curves is superior to that of the grating light curves , we use the grating light curves for the analysis below as they allow us to study the energy dependence of the timing properties . figure  [ fig : lc2]c shows the 0.5 - 8 kev acis light curve for observation 3 with @xmath1050  s time bins .",
    "we also examined the pca light curve for observation 3 , but it is background dominated and is not useful for timing analysis .    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for observations 1 and 2 , we produced power spectra using pca data taken in a high time resolution `` event '' mode ( labeled e_125us_64m_0_1s ) .",
    "these data consist of an event list with photons time tagged to within 125 @xmath48s and 64 energy bins .",
    "first , we used the data in the 3 - 20 kev band to produce leahy normalized power spectra @xcite for observations 1 and 2 separately . in each case , we averaged power spectra from four 460  s light curve segments and used a nyquist frequency of 64  hz .",
    "no noise in excess of the poisson level is present above @xmath101  hz , and there were no clearly significant differences between the power spectra for the two observations .",
    "thus , we produced another leahy normalized power spectrum ( again with a 3 - 20 kev energy band ) consisting of the eight 460  s light curve segments from observations 1 and 2 with a nyquist frequency of 8  hz .",
    "we converted to the rms normalization @xcite , and this power spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : power]a . the power spectrum is dominated by a band - limited noise component , and such a component has typically been fitted with a broken power - law or a zero - centered lorentzian in previous work @xcite .",
    "a zero - centered lorentzian with a half - width ( fwhm/2 ) of @xmath49  hz , and a fractional rms amplitude of 33.1%@xmath50% ( see table  [ tab : power ] ) provides a reasonably good fit to the power spectrum ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we note that the half - width of a zero - centered lorentzian is equivalent to the `` peak '' frequency that is sometimes quoted when fitting lorentzians to power spectra @xcite .",
    "positive residuals are present near 0.1  hz , possibly indicating the presence of a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) .",
    "the addition of a second lorentzian at 0.11  hz improves the quality of the fit , resulting in @xmath52 ; however , this improvement corresponds to a detection at only the 96% confidence level .",
    "although we repeated this analysis several times with different frequency binnings , we consistently found that the qpo is only detected at a level of between 2 and 3-@xmath28 .",
    "thus , we take the measured rms amplitude of 12% as an upper limit on a possible qpo at 0.11  hz .    )",

    "a , the dashed line shows the model used for observation 3 to illustrate that the power shifts to lower frequency for observation 3 .",
    "[ fig : power],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the grating light curves , we produced a 0.7 - 9 kev power spectrum for observations 1 and 2 by averaging eight 2414  s light curve segments .",
    "the time resolution is set by the interval of time between chip read - outs , and this interval is 2.54104  s for these observations , giving a nyquist frequency of 0.2  hz . although the time resolution and the statistical quality are lower for the grating light curves than for the pca data , using the grating data allows us to extend the timing study to lower energies and frequencies .",
    "after converting to rms normalization , we fitted the grating power spectrum with a zero - centered lorentzian , and the fit is acceptable ( @xmath53 ) . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : power ] , the half - width is @xmath54  hz , and the fractional rms is 30.1%@xmath55% .",
    "thus , the parameters for the 0.7 - 9 kev power spectrum are consistent with those for the 3 - 20 kev pca power spectrum .",
    "we also produced a power spectrum using the observation 3 acis data . using a 0.5 - 8 kev light curve with a time resolution of 0.44104  s",
    ", we produced a leahy normalized power spectrum with a nyquist frequency of 1.13  hz , consisting of the average of six 3350  s light curve intervals .",
    "in the leahy normalization , poisson noise leads to a power level of 2.0 ; however , at high frequencies ( 0.1 - 1  hz ) the acis power spectrum is consistent with a constant level of 1.77 .",
    "we performed simulations described in appendix a showing that pile - up at the level present for observation 3 leads to a drop in the poisson noise level from 2.0 to 1.78 .",
    "this , along with a small drop in the poisson noise level caused by deadtime during chip read - outs ( see appendix a ) explains our measurement of 1.77 .",
    "thus , when converting the acis power spectrum from the leahy normalization to the rms normalization , we subtracted a value of 1.77 rather than the usual value of 2.0 .",
    "the rms normalized power spectrum fitted with a zero - centered lorentzian is shown in figure  [ fig : power]b , and this model provides a good fit to the data ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the lorentzian half - width is @xmath7  hz ( see table  [ tab : power ] ) , which is significantly lower than the value obtained for observations 1 and 2 .",
    "this indicates that , as the flux drops , the band - limited noise moves to lower frequencies .",
    "this fact is illustrated in figure  [ fig : power]a , where the model used to fit the observation 3 power spectrum is plotted as a dashed line on the power spectrum for observations 1 and 2 .",
    "the fit to the observation 3 power spectrum indicates a fractional rms amplitude of 17.7%@xmath57% , but this ( 16% ) should be taken as a lower limit on the actual value since the noise level is reduced by pile - up . from our simulations , we estimate that the actual rms amplitude is near 19% .",
    "we also produced a power spectrum using only the 1573 counts from the region of the ccd that is free of pile - up .",
    "fitting the power spectrum with a zero - centered lorentzian , the half - width is not well - constrained , but it is consistent with the previous fit , and the rms amplitude is 19%@xmath58% , giving an upper limit of 26% .",
    "thus , considering the fits to the power spectra with and without pile - up , we conclude that the rms is 19%@xmath59 .      for observations 1 - 3 ,",
    "two of our main results are that the source softens ( @xmath60 changes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) and the band - limited noise component moves to lower frequencies ( the lorentzian half - width , fwhm/2 , changes from @xmath5  hz to @xmath7  hz ) as the source flux decays .",
    "thus , where possible , we determined the values of these parameters ( @xmath60 and fwhm/2 ) for other _ rxte _ observations of xte j1650500 in the hard state during outburst decay .",
    "for the 7 observations made immediately after the soft - to - hard state transition on mjd 52231.5 ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , we use the spectral parameters from @xcite .",

    "the timing parameters come from @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our _ chandra_/_rxte _ observations at low flux levels , several lorentzians are required to describe the power spectra for most of the observations immediately after the soft - to - hard state transition .",

    "_ rxte _ observations after the gap in _ rxte _ coverage and before the _ chandra _ observations began , the 3 - 20 kev energy spectra are all well - described by a single power - law component with the column density fixed to the value of @xmath63 @xmath23 found for the grating observations . for these observations ,",
    "the 3 - 20 kev flux varies from @xmath64 to @xmath65 erg  @xmath23  s@xmath1 , and the values of @xmath60 range from @xmath66 to @xmath102.0 .",
    "the data suggest a trend of softening as the flux drops consistent with that observed with _",
    "chandra _ , but the errors on @xmath60 are large for the low flux observations .",
    "we produced power spectra for all 15 observations ; however , we could not obtain reliable fit parameters for about half of the observations due to poor statistics , short observations , or flaring @xcite . in 8 cases",
    ", we obtained useful power spectra , and these are dominated by a band - limited component with a fractional rms amplitude near 30% .",
    "we fitted these power spectra with a zero - centered lorentzian to determine the half - width for comparison to the other observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : summary]a shows the measured values of the lorentzian half - width vs. 3 - 9 kev flux , and figure  [ fig : summary]b shows the half - width vs. the measured values of @xmath60 .    ) . in both panels ,",
    "the diamonds mark the measurements from observations with only _ rxte _ data and the filled circles mark observations where we obtained both _",
    "chandra _ and _ rxte _ data ( one point for observations 1 + 2 and one point for observation 3 ) .",
    "the error bars on frequency and on @xmath60 are 90% confidence.[fig : summary],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the data points above a half - width of 0.5  hz , there is a tight correlation between @xmath60 and the half - width with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.96 .",
    "the two points near 0.25  hz also appear to be consistent with this correlation , but the correlation coefficient drops slightly to 0.91 when these points are included .",
    "it is clear that the correlation does not extend to lower frequencies as @xmath60 reaches a minimum near 1.65 - 1.70 .",
    "in fact , the data at frequencies between 0.03  hz and 0.3  hz suggest the possibility of an anti - correlation between @xmath60 and the half - width , but the linear correlation coefficient is only 0.41 .",
    "we checked to see if it is valid to compare the _ chandra_/_rxte _ point in this frequency range to the _ rxte _ only points by fitting the _ rxte _ spectra alone for observations 1 and 2 .",
    "fixing @xmath67 to @xmath68 @xmath23 , we obtained values of @xmath60 consistent with those found using _",

    "although the anti - correlation is not statistically significant , the distribution of the values of @xmath60 for the 0.03 - 0.3 hz points is also not well - described by a constant at their weighted average of @xmath69 . thus , we conclude that there is some scatter in @xmath60 for the 0.03 - 0.3 hz points , but we can not establish a definite relationship between @xmath60 and the lorentzian half - width in this frequency regime .",
    "one of the main motivations for this work is to measure the x - ray properties of an accreting black hole in the relatively unexplored luminosity range between the transition to the low - hard ( or hard ) state and the quiescent state .",
    "such measurements allow us to address the question of whether these should be considered as two separate states or if the quiescent state is , in fact , a low luminosity version of the hard state .",
    "this question has important implications for whether there are significant physical changes in accreting black hole systems that occur at low luminosities such as changes in the geometry of the accretion flow and/or emission mechanisms .    for xte j1650500",
    ", we have measured the spectral and timing properties of the source at 1 - 9 kev ( absorbed ) luminosities of @xmath70 erg  s@xmath1 ( observations 1 and 2 ) and @xmath71 erg  s@xmath1 ( observation 3 ) .",
    "the quoted luminosities assume a fiducial source distance of 4  kpc , and we note that the unabsorbed luminosities are about 25% higher .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the likely distance for xte j1650500 is between 2  kpc and 6  kpc .",
    "for the _ rxte _ observation immediately after the soft - to - hard state transition , we used the spectral model described in @xcite to extrapolate the pca - measured flux into the 1 - 9 kev energy band , and we infer a transition luminosity of @xmath72 erg  s@xmath1 , which is in - line with typical transition luminosities @xcite .",
    "the observation 3 luminosity , which is a factor of 470 lower than the transition flux , is only about an order of magnitude above the quiescent luminosity of the black hole system that is brightest in quiescence ( v404  cyg , garcia et al .",
    "thus , our xte j1650500 observations cover a significant portion of the luminosity range between the soft - to - hard state transition and quiescence , but we note that the quiescent luminosity for xte j1650500 could be considerably lower than for v404  cyg .    the trend observed for xte j1650500 that the band - limited noise gradually shifts to lower frequency immediately after the transition to the hard state @xcite has also been observed for several other black hole systems @xcite . the drop in frequency",
    "can be explained by accretion models consisting of an inner optically thin corona and an outer optically thick disk . as the mass accretion rate drops , the inner radius of the optically thick disk ( @xmath73 ) moves away from the black hole , causing a drop in the dynamical time scales and , thus , the characteristic frequencies for the system @xcite .",
    "after the xte j1650500 transition to the hard state , the lorentzian half - width is correlated with the value of the power - law index down to at least a half - width of 1  hz and possibly down to 0.25  hz ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "correlations between frequency ( either half - width or qpo frequency ) and @xmath60 have been seen before during _ rxte _ observations of cyg x-1 , gx 3394 , and other black hole systems in their hard states @xcite .",
    "as these authors argue , this correlation is expected for the disk and inner corona picture because the soft photons from the optically thick disk cool the corona , leading to a softer power - law index .",
    "thus , as @xmath73 increases , and the characteristic frequencies drop , the corona is subject to a lower flux of soft photons from the disk , and the coronal spectrum hardens . this effect is predicted in both adaf @xcite models and in general disk and inner corona models such as the sphere+disk model @xcite where the x - ray emission from the corona is predominantly due to thermal comptonization .",
    "while the half - width and @xmath60 are correlated above 0.25 - 1  hz , @xmath60 does not get any harder than 1.65 - 1.70 for xte j1650500 , and the spectrum softens to @xmath62 as the half - width and flux continue to drop .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted within the adaf or sphere+disk ( henceforth adaf / sd ) models .",
    "the decrease in the half - width frequency indicates that the disk inner radius continues to recede ; however , the disk flux is at such a low level that it no longer significantly cools the corona , and the spectrum does not continue to get harder . instead , the hardness of the spectrum depends on the `` compton y - parameter , '' which is a function of the optical depth and the temperature of the corona @xcite . as the mass accretion rate drops , the coronal optical depth decreases , and a softer spectrum is predicted .",
    "softer spectra have been observed at low luminosities for several black hole sources besides xte j1650500 .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 shows significant softening that starts at an x - ray luminosity of @xmath74 erg  s@xmath1 ( @xmath75/1.8 kpc)@xmath76 , and , at the end of its 2001 outburst , xte j1550564 begins gradual softening at a luminosity of @xmath77 erg  s@xmath1 ( @xmath75/5.3 kpc)@xmath76 @xcite .",
    "other examples of spectral softening at low luminosities include gs 112468 @xcite , as well as some black hole sources in or close to quiescence @xcite .",
    "although spectral fits with the adaf model imply relatively large changes in @xmath73 between the soft and hard states , some previous black hole timing studies conclude that such changes , which can be as large as factors of 30 - 3000 @xcite , do not occur . for several black hole systems ,",
    "@xcite find that the characteristic frequencies do not vary by more than a factor of 50 between states .",
    "for keplerian orbits , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the characteristic frequency , so that a factor of 50 in frequency implies a change in @xmath73 by a factor of 14 , which is significantly less than indicated by adaf fits .",
    "however , for xte j1650500 , we find that the lorentzian half - width changes by a factor of nearly 1200 while the source remains in the hard state , implying that @xmath73 can change by as much as a factor of 113 .",
    "results of fast optical photometry for quiescent black hole systems suggest that @xmath73 may change by an even larger factor . for a  062000 ,",
    "@xcite find that the optical power spectrum is dominated by band limited noise with a break frequency of @xmath80 hz , which is a factor of 3.7 lower than the lowest frequency we find for xte j1650500 .",
    "if the frequency is , in fact , related to @xmath73 , then our result for xte j1650500 and the results of @xcite imply that very large values of @xmath73 occur at low luminosities , and that the @xmath73 evolution occurs gradually and continues to change all the way down to quiescent luminosities .",
    "these results also imply that an extremely large value of @xmath73 is not required for a source to show hard state properties .    while the adaf / sd models described above can explain many of the x - ray properties we see for xte j1650500 , radio observations of xte j1650500 made after the transition to the hard state indicate the likely presence of a compact jet ( corbel et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , which is not accounted for in these models",
    ". however , the `` magnetic corona '' model of @xcite also explains several of the xte j1650500 x - ray properties while predicting that energy stored in the corona should be available to drive strong outflows . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray emission mechanism is also comptonization , so that a high flux of disk photons leads to a softer energy spectrum .",
    "thus , @xcite predict that the spectrum will harden as the mass accretion rate drops , and they also predict that the spectrum will soften at very low mass accretion rates as more of the coronal energy is carried away by the outflow .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests that we are observing xte j1650500 in a luminosity regime where this could occur .",
    "while the xte j1650500 spectral evolution is consistent with the @xcite model , and we also previously argued that this model may be able to account for the x - ray flares reported in @xcite , it is unclear if the magnetic corona model can account for the fact that the observed characteristic frequency for xte j1650500 changes by a factor of 1200 in the hard state .",
    "perhaps this could indicate large variations in the size of the magnetic corona or in the sizes of the active coronal regions , but since @xmath73 is not expected to change by a large factor in this model , we do not see an obvious explanation for the large frequency range .",
    "a jet - dominated model has also been suggested for black holes in their hard state . in this model",
    ", the compact jet contributes a large fraction of the emission from the radio band up to x - ray energies , and a synchrotron emission mechanism is invoked @xcite .",
    "evidence in favor of this model includes observations of correlated radio and x - ray flux for several black hole systems @xcite , and good agreement between the predictions of the model and the broadband gx 3394 energy spectra over a large range of mass accretion rates @xcite . in the model ,",
    "x - rays are produced when electrons are accelerated at a shock that is @xmath81 from the black hole , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the black hole mass .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is predicted to have a power - law shape out to a cutoff energy , and the power - law index is set by the index of the electron energy distribution , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite find that they can explain the radio / x - ray flux correlation for gx 3394 by varying only the jet power , keeping @xmath84 and @xmath86 constant .",
    "the fact that @xmath60 changes for xte j1650500 and also for gx 3394 @xcite , indicates that if this model is correct , @xmath84 likely does change with source luminosity , but we suspect that changes in @xmath60 are probably not a major problem for this model as one might expect @xmath84 to vary somewhat with jet power . on the other hand",
    ", one would expect that the characteristic frequencies of the system would be related to the size of the source .",
    "assuming that the size of the x - ray emitting region is related to the location of the shock , @xmath86 , it may be difficult for the jet - dominated model to explain the large range of characteristic frequencies we observe for xte j1650500 without varying @xmath86 .",
    "we have compared the emission properties of xte j1650500 in the hard state over a large range of luminosities to adaf / sd , magnetic corona , and jet - dominated models .",
    "although the adaf / sd model provides natural explanations for the x - ray spectral and timing properties , these models do not include outflows and thus can not provide a complete description of the system .",
    "in addition , adafs may be convectively unstable as mentioned above .",
    "the magnetic corona model , which does incorporate a jet , predicts a similar spectral evolution to the adaf / sd model , but it it unclear if it can explain the large change in the lorentzian half - width that we see for xte j1650500 .",
    "the jet - dominated model can explain x - ray / radio correlations that are seen for several black hole sources without varying @xmath86 ; however , it is doubtful that the model can reproduce the observed x - ray timing properties with a constant value of @xmath86 .",
    "regardless of which model is correct , the fact that the general shape of the energy and power spectra remain the same while the parameters evolve indicates that the x - ray emitting region of the system likely keeps the same overall structure even though the parameter changes indicate that some physical properties change , such as the inner radius of the accretion disk , the size of the corona , or the shock location , considering the models described above .",
    "it is clear that the source retains its hard state x - ray properties down to a luminosity of @xmath71 erg  s@xmath1 , and we do not see any evidence for a sharp transition to the quiescent state .",
    "furthermore , our results for xte j1650500 combined with the determination that the optical power spectrum for a  062000 in quiescence exhibits band limited noise with an even lower characteristic frequency @xcite suggests that black hole transients keep the same overall structure into quiescence .",

    "we produced a leahy normalized power spectrum using the simulated light curve , and the poisson level is 1.97 .",
