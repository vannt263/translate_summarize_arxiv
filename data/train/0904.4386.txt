    "the aim of this paper is to study intrinsic ultracontractivity for feynman - kac semigroups generated by schrdinger operators based on fractional laplacians and obtain sharp estimates of the first eigenfunction of these operators .",

    "for example in 2008 r. frank , e. lieb and r. seiringer @xcite showed hardy - lieb - thirring inequality for such schrdinger operators .",
    "this was done in connections with the problem of the stability of relativistic matter , which problem is closely related to non - local schrdinger operators and has been widely studied see e.g. @xcite . in the last 20 years",
    "there were obtained many results for schrdinger operators based on fractional laplacians @xcite .",
    "these results concern the conditional gauge theorem , @xmath5-harmonic functions , intrinsic ultracontractivity , estimates of eigenfunctions .",
    "most of these results are obtained for schrdinger operators on bounded domains and not on the whole @xmath1 as in our paper .",

    "it is worth to point out that there are huge differences between our paper and @xcite .",
    "our paper not only concerns different schrdinger operators @xmath0 but uses completely new methods .",
    "these methods may be described as the use of uniform estimates of @xmath5-harmonic functions in proving intrinsic ultracontractivity .",

    "it is worth to point out that both the proof of ubhp in @xcite and our uniform estimates of @xmath5-harmonic functions ( lemma [ lm : est ] , theorem [ th : bhi ] , corollary [ cor : bhisc ] ) use a very important idea from r. song and j. m. wu paper ( * ? ? ?",
