    "observed star formation takes place within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , so understanding how these clouds form and evolve is a key step towards understanding star formation .",
    "the main chemical constituent of any gmc is molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) , but this is very difficult to observe _ in situ_. for this reason it is common to use emission from carbon monoxide ( co ) as a proxy for h@xmath1 .    in order to do this , however , it is necessary to understand the relationship between the distributions of the h@xmath1 and the co. they have rather different formation mechanisms : h@xmath1 forms on the surface of dust grains , while co forms in the gas - phase as a product of ion - neutral chemistry .",
    "both are readily photodissociated by ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , but h@xmath1 can protect itself from this radiation via self - shielding even in relatively low column density gas ( draine & bertoldi @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore expect to find large variations in the co / h@xmath1 ratio within any given gmc , with the h@xmath1 filling a significantly larger volume of the cloud than the co.    despite this , there is good evidence that co _ emission _ is a good tracer of h@xmath1 mass within the milky way ( see e.g.  solomon _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , dame _",
    "et  al . _",
    "a number of independent studies have shown that gmcs in the galactic disk show a good correlation between the integrated intensity of the @xmath2 rotational transition line of @xmath3co and the h@xmath1 column density .",
    "this correlation is typically described in terms of a conversion factor @xmath4 ( the ` x - factor ' ) , given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the velocity - integrated intensity of the co @xmath2 emission line , averaged over the projected area of the gmc , and @xmath7 is the mean h@xmath1 column density of the gmc , averaged over the same area .",
    "however , the issue of the environmental dependence of @xmath4 remains highly contentious .",
    "extragalactic measurements of @xmath4 that use a virial analysis to determine cloud masses find values for @xmath4 that are similar to those obtained in the milky way , with at most a weak metallicity dependence ( e.g.  rosolowsky _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , bolatto _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , measurements that constrain gmc masses using techniques that do not depend on co emission",
    "consistently find values for @xmath4 that are much larger than the galactic value and that are suggestive of a strong metallicity dependence ( e.g.  israel @xcite , leroy _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations provide us with one way to address this observational dichotomy .",
    "if we can understand the distribution of co and h@xmath1 in realistic models of gmcs , then we may begin to understand why the different types of observation give such different results . in this contribution",
    ", we summarize the results from some of our recent numerical simulations that self - consistently model both the chemistry and the turbulent dynamics of the gas within gmcs , and discuss what they can tell us about the behaviour of @xmath4 .",
    "we have performed a large number of simulations of the chemical and thermal evolution of the turbulent , dense interstellar medium using a modified version of the zeus - mp magnetohydrodynamical code .",
    "our modifications include the addition of a simplified treatment of hydrogen , carbon and oxygen chemistry , a detailed atomic and molecular cooling function , and a treatment of the effects of ultraviolet radiation using a six - ray approximation .",
    "full details of these modifications can be found in glover _",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations begin with initially uniform atomic gas , threaded by a uniform magnetic field with strength @xmath8 .",
    "the initial velocity field is turbulent , with power concentrated on large scales , and with an initial rms velocity of 5  @xmath9 .",
    "we drive the turbulence so as to maintain approximately the same rms velocity throughout the simulation .",
    "we adopt periodic boundary conditions for the gas and in most cases use a cubical simulation volume with a side length @xmath10  pc . in a few simulations ,",
    "we adopt a smaller - sized box , with @xmath11  pc .",
    "we have run simulations with a variety of mean densities and metallicities , in order to span a range of different physical conditions .",
    "full details of these simulations can be found in glover & mac low ( @xcite ) .",
    "because the co in many of our simulations is optically thick , an accurate determination of @xmath6 would require a full non - lte radiative transfer calculation , a complex undertaking outside the scope of our present study .",
    "instead , we make use of a simpler procedure to determine an estimate for the co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor , denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "we first select a set of independent sightlines through our simulation , one per resolution element .",
    "we next compute h@xmath1 and co column densities along each of these sightlines .",
    "we convert each of the co column densities into an estimate of the optical depth of the gas in the co @xmath2 transition , under the assumptions that ( a ) the co level populations are in lte , ( b ) the gas is isothermal , with a temperature equal to the co - weighted mean temperature found in the actual simulation , and ( c ) the co linewidth is uniform , and is given by @xmath13 . given an estimate for the co optical depth",
    ", we then compute an estimate for @xmath6 using the same technique as in pineda _",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) . finally , we average over all the sightlines to compute a mean intensity @xmath14 for the simulation , and do the same for the h@xmath1 to arrive at a mean h@xmath1 column density .",
    "@xmath12 is then simply the ratio of these two values .",
    "conversion factor @xmath12 , plotted as a function of the mean visual extinction of the gas , @xmath15 . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the values we find are consistent with the value of @xmath17 determined observationally for the milky way by dame _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , indicated in the plot by the horizontal dashed line . at @xmath18",
    ", we find evidence for a strong dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath15 .",
    "the empirical fit given by equation  [ emp - fit ] is indicated as the dotted line in the figure , and demonstrates that at low @xmath15 , the co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor increases roughly as @xmath19 .",
    "[ xfact ] ]    using this procedure , we have computed @xmath12 for each of our simulations .",
    "figure  [ xfact ] shows how the values we obtain depend on the mean visual extinction of the gas , @xmath15 .",
    "we see from the figure that there is a clear change in the behaviour of @xmath12 at @xmath20 . in clouds with",
    "larger mean extinctions , @xmath12 is roughly constant and has a value consistent with the observationally - determined value for the milky way . on the other hand , for smaller mean extinctions",
    ", @xmath12 increases sharply with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "this behaviour is caused by a rapid fall - off in the co abundance with decreasing mean extinction , which leads to a corresponding sharp drop in @xmath6 . because it does not self - shield efficiently , co molecules are protected from photodissociation primarily by dust extinction , and so as this decreases , the co abundance decreases much more rapidly than the h@xmath1 abundance , resulting in the rapid increase we find for @xmath12 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath15 can be described by the empirical fitting function @xmath21 illustrated in figure  [ xfact ] by the dotted line .    the sharp fall - off in @xmath6 with decreasing mean extinction has an important consequence .",
    "in order to detect co emission from gmcs in local group galaxies , the integrated intensity of the emission must be @xmath22 or higher , and we find in our simulations that only the clouds with @xmath23 have integrated intensities above this value .",
    "therefore , gmcs detectable in co will always sit on the right - hand side of figure  [ xfact ] , in the regime where @xmath12 is roughly constant , providing a simple explanation for why values of @xmath4 in extragalactic systems derived using co observations are always roughly the same as the galactic value . on the other hand , gmcs with mass determinations that do not rely on co",
    "are not constrained to fall in the regime where @xmath6 is large , and so may occur anywhere in the plot , thereby explaining why they are often found to have x - factors that are much larger than the galactic value . a further consequence of the behaviour of @xmath4 and @xmath6 is the prediction that co - bright clouds in low metallicity systems must be larger and/or denser than their milky way counterparts , since at lower metallicity a larger surface density of gas is required to produce the necessary mean extinction .    99 bolatto , a.  d. , leroy , a.  k. , rosolowsky , e. , walter , f. , & blitz , l. 2008 , apj , 686 , 948 dame , t.  m. , hartmann , d. , and thaddeus , p. 2001",
