    "much effort is being expended to measure the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy on increasingly smaller angular scales . for many types of models for structure formation , the spectrum can be predicted to a precision of about 1% ( @xcite ) , raising the hope that the cosmological parameters that are the input to these calculations can be extracted to comparable precision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the `` inverse problem '' of reconstructing the model given a spectrum is less well understood than the `` forward problem '' of predicting it given the model . for this purpose , it is important to assess the generation of anisotropies in a manner that is not tied to any given model for structure formation .",
    "from the theory of anisotropy formation , we know that cmb fluctuations suffered causal processing and damping of the primordial signal . in this paper , we numerically calibrate such effects , extending and improving upon prior work ( hu & sugiyama 1995ab , 1996 , hereafter @xcite and @xcite ) .    a particularly fruitful way to visualize the cmb spectrum , and one that provides a framework for the inverse problem , is as a product of transfer functions representing individual physical effects . the spectrum",
    "is then constructed out of physical elements rather than a model - dependent parameterization .",
    "conceptually , the evolution of cmb anisotropies processes primordial metric or gravitational potential perturbations into features observable in the spectrum today ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since the evolution obeys linear perturbation theory , its effects are described by a series of transfer functions that multiply the underlying perturbations .",
    "the form of these functions depends on the cosmological model , not only for the background expansion and thermal history ( see e.g.  @xcite ) but also for structure formation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . by decomposing the evolution into functions representing separate physical effects",
    ", we can isolate portions of the anisotropy spectrum that are the most sensitive to particular aspects of the cosmological model .",
    "in particular , processes that damp cmb anisotropies , photon diffusion ( @xcite ) and rescattering ( @xcite ) , depend mainly on the background parameters and little on the perturbations that form structure in the universe . in ",
    "[ sec - calculation ] , we isolate these effects in a numerical treatment . from this damping calibration ,",
    "we produce convenient fitting formulae that accurately describe the behavior of the diffusion and reionization damping transfer functions , or envelopes , directly in anisotropy multipole space . in  [ sec - information ] , we illustrate the reconstruction process by testing it with known models within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario . by removing the model - independent effects of damping ,",
    "one uncovers important model - dependent effects such as the baryon - drag modulation of the peaks ( @xcite ) , the potential envelope that describes gravitational driving of acoustic oscillations ( @xcite ) , and the regeneration of anisotropies during reionization ( @xcite ) .    in the context of currently popular models , recovery of these signatures will help distinguish between such possibilities as an inflationary or cosmological defect origin of fluctuations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of damping are also intrinsically interesting because they provide the most model - independent probes of the background cosmology .",
    "we also consider how diffusion damping can be used to constrain the curvature of the universe and reionization damping to determine the redshift and extent of reionization in the universe . in this way",
    ", the study of effects in the damping tail of cmb anisotropies presented here will aid in the future reconstruction of the cosmological model from the anisotropy data .",
    "damping processes which affect cmb anisotropies provide the most model - independent information available in the spectrum and allow constraints on cosmological parameters such as the curvature and the thermal history of the universe .",
    "furthermore , these universal effects obscure the model-_dependent _ signatures that are useful to determine the mechanism for structure formation in the universe and the ultimate source of density perturbations .    for both these reasons ,",
    "an accurate calibration of damping effects is desirable . in this section ,",
    "we begin with the formalism necessary to describe them (  [ ss - boltzmann ] ) and simple approximations to help understand their nature (  [ ss - analytic ] ) .",
    "we then turn to numerical calibration of these effects (  [ ss - numerical ] ) .",
    "finally , we give convenient fitting formulae to their effects on the anisotropy power spectrum that encapsulate these results (  [ ss - fitting ] ) .      in this section , we provide the formalism for the evolution of cmb anisotropies that underly the calculations which follow .",
    "it may be skimmed upon first reading .",
    "the anisotropy in the cmb is described by small perturbations of the photon distribution function around a homogeneous and isotropic black - body .",

    "if the optical depth across a wavelength @xmath29 , this power flows to higher @xmath30 much like a wave pulse flows along a string , being concentrated in mode @xmath30 when @xmath31 .",
    "the critical epoch for this process is horizon crossing @xmath32 after which @xmath33 modes can be populated .",
    "when the free electron density is not negligible then the compton scattering terms ( @xmath34 terms ) become important .",
    "modes with @xmath35 are exponentially damped , sealing off the hierarchy and providing a barrier off which the wave pulse reflects .",
    "the monopole term is not damped at all and the dipole term is driven toward @xmath20 so that the distribution is isotropic in the electron rest frame .",
    "thus before recombination , @xmath36 , and the photon distribution possesses only the @xmath26 ( density ) and @xmath28 ( velocity ) modes , which represent a fluid that oscillates acoustically due to photon pressure ( see  [ ss - analytic ] ) . only for very high @xmath7 will power leak into the higher @xmath30 modes , where it will be exponentially damped .",
    "this is responsible for the damping tail at small angular scales .",
    "an increase in @xmath34 at late times due to reionization also possesses a characteristic signature . for scales inside the horizon at reionization , the power has already propagated to high @xmath30 where it suffers exponential damping ; for larger scales no such damping occurs .",
    "thus reionization damps small - scale anisotropies while preserving large - scale anisotropies .",
    "we shall discuss these behaviors more quantitatively in the next section .      before turning to the numerical calibration of effects in the damping tail ,",
    "it is useful to describe them analytically to see how they enter in and affect the boltzmann evolution given above .",
    "the two main damping processes at work in the cmb are photon diffusion before recombination and rescattering during an epoch of late reionization .      for wavelengths much larger than the mean free path to compton scattering @xmath37 , the boltzmann hierarchy of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) can be described by the relativistic fluid dynamics of a combined photon - baryon fluid .",
    "rapid scattering insures that any anisotropy of the photons in the electron rest frame is vanishingly small so that the hierarchy can be truncated at @xmath28 with @xmath38 . even in this _ tightly - coupled _ regime , the random walk of the photons through the electrons eventually mixes photons across a wavelength of the fluctuation ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we expect temperature perturbations to be destroyed by this diffusive process _ before _",
    "the mean free path grows long enough to invalidate the central approximation .",
    "this statement is only approximately true during the recombination epoch when the mean free path grows so rapidly that it approaches the horizon scale and coincides with the diffusion scale .",
    "for this reason , we calibrate the process numerically in  [ ss - numerical ] .",
    "formally , we can approximate these effects by expanding the boltzmann temperature and polarization equations ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) and ( [ eqn : polarization ] ) in powers of @xmath39 ( @xcite ) .",
    "to lowest order , one obtains the oscillator equation ( @xcite ) @xmath40 gravity drives the oscillator by potential infall into @xmath16 and density dilution as the curvature fluctuation @xmath15 changes .",
    "the baryon inertia in the fluid is described by the relative baryon - photon momentum density ratio @xmath41 and increases the effective mass of the oscillator .",
    "together these effects imply oscillations at the sound speed @xmath42 around a zero point displaced by gravity to @xmath43 for slowly - varying @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .    to treat the effects of diffusion , one must include higher order terms .",
    "an examination of the @xmath28 photon euler equation ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) shows that there are two diffusive effects : viscous damping from the quadrupole @xmath44 and heat conduction from the relative photon - baryon velocity @xmath45 ( @xcite ) . from the expansion of the polarization hierarchy , @xmath46 and the quadrupole evolution equation ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) with @xmath47 , we obtain the tight - coupling prediction for the quadrupole , @xmath48 heat conduction may be described by expanding the baryon euler equation ( [ eqn : baryoneuler ] ) to second order .",

    "notice that the diffusion length is roughly the geometric mean of the mean free path @xmath60 and horizon length @xmath3 as one would expect of a random walk @xmath61 .      as the universe recombines , the mean free path and hence the diffusion length of the photons increases .",
    "as long as the diffusion length is much greater than the mean free path , damping can be described by the tight - coupling approximation of the previous section . this is because the mean free path only surpasses the wavelength _",
    "after _ diffusion has already destroyed the perturbations , resulting in no contributions outside of the tight - coupling regime .",
    "the approximation thus remains approximately true until quite near the end of recombination when the mean free path becomes comparable to the horizon and so the diffusion length ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fact explains the reasonable level of agreement between the numerical results we present in  [ ss - numerical ] and the tight - coupling approximation .",
    "the remaining subtlety is that due to the finite duration of recombination , last scattering takes place at a slightly different epoch , with a slightly different diffusion length , for each photon .",

    "an extended period @xmath70 becomes less steep .",
    "both the width of the visibility function and the evolution of @xmath57 through it affect this drop . again the baryon dependence of these two effects are in opposition leading to a steepening of the slope at both the high and low @xmath69 limits .",
    "after recombination photons enter the free - streaming regime .",
    "the observer views a temperature fluctuation at wavenumber @xmath7 on the last scattering surface as an anisotropy at multipole moment @xmath72 , where the constant of proportionality @xmath73 from numerical fitting ( see  [ ss - numerical ] ) and the comoving angular - size distance to the epoch @xmath3 is @xmath74 , \\label{eqn : angularsize}\\ ] ] for @xmath75 . for positively curved universes , replace sinh with sin .",
    "the fact that angular size depends sensitively on the curvature allows its precise measurement from acoustic features ( @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are represented formally in the boltzmann equation ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) by the transfer of power down the @xmath30-hierarchy with distance @xmath76 from the last scattering event and the geodesic deviation factors @xmath77 .",
    "note that the latter becomes important when the distance is long enough such that the subtended angle @xmath78 , i.e.  smaller than that of a wavelength at the curvature distance .",

    "the projection of @xmath7-mode inhomogeneities onto @xmath30-mode anisotropies depends on the viewing angle and is thus not one - to - one .",

    ", the angular separation between the intersections of the flat wavefront with the spherical shell at @xmath80 is much larger than @xmath81 .",
    "sharp features in @xmath7-space will thus be blurred in @xmath30-space and excess power at small physical scales can be aliased into large angular scales .",
    "formally , this is reflected by the decomposition of the @xmath7-mode on the sphere and the fact that the solution to the sourceless boltzmann or liouville equation is just its radial component , a spherical bessel function in flat space ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for the cases we consider , where the @xmath7-space features are broad with no strong deviations from scale invariance , the simple approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : angularsize ] ) suffices .      from the null detection of the gunn - peterson effect ( @xcite ) , we know that the universe was reionized at least as early as redshift @xmath82 .",
    "reionization recouples the photons to the electron - baryon plasma . the same process that is responsible for diffusion damping acts to destroy anisotropies during this epoch as well .",
    "during the free - streaming epoch , the effective `` diffusion length '' is simply the horizon scale .",
    "photon trajectories from different temperature regions on the last scattering surface intersect forming the anisotropy that is represented by the @xmath83 photon modes .",
    "when the universe reionizes , the photons which rescatter lose their anisotropy .",
    "note that the isotropic temperature fluctuation that exists above the horizon , where trajectories have not yet crossed , does not damp by rescattering .",
    "this is reflected in the lack of a @xmath84 coupling term in the @xmath26 mode of the boltzmann equation ( [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "the @xmath28 mode damps in such a way as to drive @xmath85 toward @xmath20 so that the distribution is isotropic in the electron rest frame .    even in a reionized universe , photons",
    "eventually last scatter as the electron density drops due to the expansion and the mean free path to scattering exceeds the horizon length .",
    "thus only the fraction @xmath86 of the photons that did not rescatter contribute to the anisotropy below the horizon at last scattering @xmath87 . above this scale",
    "all photons contribute .",
    "thus the rough form of the reionization damping function becomes @xmath88 where again the effect of the finite duration of last scattering on @xmath87 can be accounted for by the visibility function ( see  [ ss - fitting ] ) .",

    "<S> by decomposing the damping tail of cmb anisotropies into a series of transfer functions representing individual physical effects , we provide ingredients that will aid in the reconstruction of the cosmological model from small - scale cmb anisotropy data . </S>",
    "<S> we accurately calibrate the model - independent effects of diffusion and reionization damping which provide potentially the most robust information on the background cosmology . removing these effects </S>",
    "<S> , we uncover model - dependent processes such as the acoustic peak modulation and gravitational enhancement that can help distinguish between alternate models of structure formation and provide windows into the evolution of fluctuations at various stages in their growth .    </S>",
