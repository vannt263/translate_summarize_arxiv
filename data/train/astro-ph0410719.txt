    "the cl 1604 supercluster at @xmath7 is one of the best studied high - redshift large scale structures .",
    "it was initially detected as two separate clusters in the plate - based survey of @xcite , with redshifts and preliminary velocity dispersions measured by @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the two clusters cl 1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 in both radial velocity ( 4300  km  s@xmath8 ) and position on the sky ( @xmath9 ) prompted @xcite to perform deep multi - band imaging with cosmic @xcite on the palomar 5-m telescope covering the area between the two clusters .",
    "the imaging revealed additional overdensities of red galaxies whose colors were consistent with spectroscopically - confirmed , early - type galaxies in the two original clusters ( see figs . 2 and 4 of * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting that the clusters were part of a high - redshift supercluster .",
    "a total of four distinct red galaxy density peaks were identified in a contiguous area of @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite conducted a large spectrographic survey using lris and deimos @xcite on the keck 10-m telescopes to confirm the new cluster candidates and provide accurate velocity dispersions for all four supercluster components .",
    "they detected 230 total cluster members , confirming that all four components were in fact supercluster members .",
    "these four clusters were nevertheless well - separated both in projection and in redshift , and have velocity dispersions ranging from 480 to 980 km s@xmath8 , corresponding to abell richness classes of @xmath11 .    the large radial depth of the supercluster ( @xmath12 mpc ) in comparison to the small area imaged with cosmic ( @xmath13 mpc ) suggested that this structure could extend to a significantly larger area on the sky . to test this hypothesis and search for new supercluster components",
    ", we undertook a wide area , multi - band imaging survey using the large format camera ( lfc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the palomar 5-m telescope . in this paper , we present the results of this survey , including several new candidate supercluster members .",
    "we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "two fields in the region of the cl 1604 supercluster were imaged using the lfc on the palomar 5-m telescope .",
    "the lfc is a mosaic of six @xmath17 ccds in a cross - shaped layout , mounted at prime focus .",
    "the imaging area corresponds roughly to the unvignetted region of a circle @xmath18 in diameter .",
    "data were taken on ut 2001 may 15 and 17 and ut 2004 april 26 and 27 , with the camera installed in the standard north - south orientation and all six ccds in use .",
    "the imaging data were taken in unbinned mode , with a pixel scale of @xmath19 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "seeing on all nights was better than @xmath20 , with average seeing of @xmath21 .",
    "individual exposures of 450s were taken , moving the telescope by up to @xmath22 in each direction to alleviate the image gaps due to the spaces between the ccds .",
    "data were taken at two central pointings , using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath23,@xmath3 , and @xmath24 filters .",
    "only the night of ut 2004 april 27 was photometric , so individual exposures were taken in all three filters at both pointings to allow calibration of the deep images .",
    "a variety of standards from @xcite were also observed over a range of airmasses on this night .",
    "table  [ obslog ] provides the total integration times in each filter for the two pointings .",
    "data reduction was performed using the iraf data reduction suite @xcite , including the external package _",
    "mscred_. we followed the general mosaic imaging guidelines used by the noao deep wide field survey @xcite , with modifications appropriate to our data .",
    "the data were overscan - subtracted , bias corrected , flat fielded , and fringe corrected in the standard way .",
    "dark sky flats were generated by combining the deep images ; the application of this secondary flat field results in images with less than @xmath25 residual sensitivity variations across the field .",
    "cosmic rays were detected using the _ craverage _ task , and a visual inspection of each image was performed to identify any additional bad pixels or cosmic rays .",
    "all bad pixels due to cosmic rays , instrument defects , saturation , bleed trails , and satellite trails were masked .",
    "astrometry was performed on each image using the task _ msccmatch _ to match detected objects with the usno - a2 catalog .",
    "typically between 100 and 300 usno - a2 stars are matched in each field and fitted with fourth - order polynomials in both dimensions , resulting in rms errors of @xmath26 in each coordinate .",
    "individual exposures were then projected onto the tangent plane using _ mscimage _ , and all exposures of a single pointing in a single filter were combined with _",
    "mscstack_. additionally , all exposures of each field ( in @xmath23 , @xmath3 , and @xmath24 ) were combined with _",
    "mscstack _ to produce an extremely deep detection image .",
    "images of photometric standards were subjected to the identical reduction as target exposures .",
    "crrccc 1 & 16:03:53.5 & + 43:21:33.3 & 3600 & 5850 & 3600 + 2 & 16:05:05.7 & + 43:04:18.4 & 4950 & 5850 & 3600 + [ obslog ]    photometric calibrations were derived from standard star magnitudes measured in a variety of circular apertures using sextractor @xcite .",
    "we solved for zero points , as well as color and airmass terms using : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the zeropoint , @xmath29 is the airmass coefficient , @xmath30 is the airmass at which the standard was observed , @xmath31 is the color coefficient , and the color used is @xmath4 for the @xmath23 and @xmath3 data , and @xmath32 for the @xmath24 data .",
    "object detection in the target frames was performed by running sextractor v2.3 in dual - image mode , using the ultra - deep image for detection , while measurements were performed on the single - band images .",
    "photometry apertures are determined from the deep image , and these same apertures are used for the individual filter images .",
    "we use variable diameter elliptical apertures with major axis radius @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the kron radius @xcite ; the magnitudes measured in these apertures are output as mag_auto in sextractor .",
    "this procedure results in catalogs in which magnitudes are measured using identical apertures in all three filters , which improves the measurement of galaxy colors by using the same physical size for each galaxy in all filters @xcite . to calibrate photometrically the deep exposures , shallower images taken on photometric nights were sextractor - ed , and matched to the deeper data .",
    "zero point offsets ( typically @xmath35 mag ) were derived and applied to the deep catalogs . to remove spurious objects around bright stars or near detector edges , as well as those with uncertain photometry , we require detection in both the @xmath23 and @xmath3 images , and exclude objects with large photometric errors ( mag_err@xmath36 in either band ) , abnormally large semi - major axis ( a @xmath37 ; typically faint objects deblended from a very bright companion ) , and zero isophotal area ( objects in masked areas ) .    because the two lfc pointings overlap slightly , the catalogs were combined and objects detected in both pointings had one detection removed .",
    "additionally , there is a significant gap in the corner where the two lfc pointings meet . to fill this area",
    ", we used existing data from the cosmic imager , taken as part of the survey presented in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ layout ] shows the locations of the lfc and cosmic pointings .",
    "the cosmic images were taken using the cousins @xmath38 and gunn @xmath39 filters ; to transform these data to the sdss system , we matched objects in the overlap region between the cosmic and lfc fields , fitting relations for both the @xmath23 and @xmath3 filters of the form    @xmath40    the transformed cosmic magnitudes show a @xmath41 scatter of 0.1 mag relative to the lfc magnitudes .",
    "the catalogs from the two lfc pointings and the two cosmic pointings were combined into a single master catalog , deleting duplicate detections in overlap regions with a preference for the slightly deeper lfc data .",
    "the final combined catalog contains @xmath42 unique objects .",
    "the observed colors of early - type galaxies are strongly redshift dependent .",
    "even at @xmath43 , the red sequence @xcite of cluster ellipticals can be detected @xcite .",
    "thus , searching for overdensities of galaxies with the appropriate colors provides a simple yet effective means of detecting clusters even at moderate to high redshifts .",
    "in addition , we have obtained a substantial number of redshifts of supercluster members @xcite that can be used to verify the cluster galaxy colors .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] plots the @xmath23 versus @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all objects in our imaging area .",
    "spectroscopically confirmed cluster members are superposed as large filled circles .",
    "the vertical solid line shows the magnitude limit corresponding to the survey depth of @xmath44 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical dashed lines show the color and magnitude cuts used to create the density maps in figure 3 .",
    "the right panel shows the color distribution of all objects with @xmath45 ( dotted histogram ) and the spectroscopically confirmed supercluster members ( solid histogram ) , scaled to the same peak counts .",
    "the red sequence of supercluster members is clearly visible at @xmath46 .",
    "numerous bluer cluster galaxies are also evident ; these are likely galaxies with ongoing star formation and therefore show strong [ o ii ] @xmath47 emission redshifted into the @xmath23 filter .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the large fraction ( @xmath48 ) of spectroscopic members which show [ o ii ] emission in their spectra . to perform cluster detection , we use only those objects with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the color range was chosen to maximize the contrast of possible supercluster members relative to fore- and background galaxies , as seen in the right panel of figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the @xmath3 magnitude limit was selected so that both the cosmic and lfc imaging catalogs are reasonably complete in both @xmath23 and @xmath3 .",
    "these cuts eliminate the vast majority of foreground galaxies ; only @xmath51 objects satisfy these criteria .    using the color - selected galaxies",
    ", we produce an adaptive kernel surface density map @xcite , with @xmath52 pixels and an initial smoothing window of @xmath53 , corresponding to 1 @xmath54 mpc at the supercluster redshift .",
    "the adaptive kernel uses a two - stage process to generate a density map .",
    "it first produces an initial estimate of the galaxy density at each point in the map using a fixed grid .",
    "it then uses this pilot estimate to apply a smoothing kernel whose size changes as a function of local density , with a smaller kernel at higher density .",
    "the smoothing size is chosen to separate the individual clusters in the supercluster without resolving much of the substructure in the clusters .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ akmap ] shows the density map for the color - selected objects from the combined lfc and cosmic data , covering an area of @xmath55 .",
    "the four previously detected clusters at @xmath7 are marked with circles and labeled with the same lettering scheme as @xcite .",
    "these four clusters are clearly detected as significant density peaks . however , there are a number of additional density enhancements of similar significance to the known members , especially to the northwest of the originally imaged region . to confirm that these structures are not spurious , we generated several density maps using a variety of smoothing kernels corresponding to @xmath56 mpc , as well as somewhat narrower and broader color cuts .",
    "similar structures were visible in all such maps .",
    "we note the existence of numerous less significant density peaks and filaments in this map",
    ". these may be filamentary structure and possible very - low - mass systems associated with the supercluster .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ akmap ] shows the same density map , but only pixels with red galaxy surface densities of @xmath5714,000 galaxies deg@xmath58 are shown .",
    "this threshold is set to include all of the spectroscopically confirmed clusters .",
    "at least four additional structures , labeled `` e , '' `` f , '' `` g '' , and `` h '' , are above this threshold . we note that this choice of threshold is subjective ; as mentioned before , many other overdensities are apparent .",
    "however , the spectroscopic observations indicate that the poorest of the four confirmed clusters has a velocity dispersion of only 489 km s@xmath8 , typical of low mass clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , the chosen density contrast will select galaxy concentrations consistent with even rather poor clusters .",
    "we also ran sextractor on the density map with detection parameters fine - tuned to detect the four known clusters .",
    "this automated detection procedure picks up the same density peaks as those found visually .",
    "it is unclear from this map whether e and f are unique clusters , or substructures related to the known members c and d , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the newly detected structures are outside the region for which we have obtained spectroscopy , so no conclusions about their independence can be drawn at this time . similarly ,",
    "g and h are very close in projection and may be components of a merging system .",
    "they are , however , clearly separated from the other supercluster members .",
    "their nearest neighbor is over 4 @xmath54 mpc distant .",
    "future deimos spectroscopic observations are planned to determine supercluster membership for the newly discovered structures .",
    "from the multicolor imaging data we are able to examine a limited number of cluster properties for each candidate .",
    "the richness is estimated by counting the number of red galaxies ( @xmath59 ) in the magnitude range where both the cosmic and lfc data are complete ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "if all of the new candidate clusters are at the same redshift as the known ones , then this method samples the same ( albeit bright ) portion of the luminosity function and gives the relative richnesses of the clusters , subject to variations in the galaxy colors among the clusters .",
    "the computed richnesses , along with the cluster coordinates , are provided in table  [ clusprops ] .",
    "these coordinates are measured from the peaks in the red galaxy density map , and are slightly offset from the spectroscopic centers reported in @xcite .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic centers of clusters a , c , and d agree to within @xmath61 ; the photometric center of cluster b is @xmath62 ( 0.25 @xmath54 mpc ) south of the spectroscopic center , likely because this cluster appears significantly elongated to the south .",
    "the redshifts and velocity dispersions from @xcite for the previously detected supercluster members are also given .",
    "we note that cluster c has comparable richness to three other previously known clusters , despite having a much lower velocity dispersion .",
    "this cluster was only partially imaged in the earlier survey and thus may not have complete spectroscopic coverage .",

    "the enhancement of red cluster galaxies is clearly visible in these individual cmds and color distributions .",
    "if the red galaxy overdensities detected in this imaging survey are truly members of the cl 1604 supercluster at @xmath7 , we have identified by far the largest known structure at redshifts approaching unity . the largest projected separation ( ag ) is approximately @xmath63 mpc , still much smaller than the apparent @xmath6 mpc depth .",

    "if the angular separation between the sufficiently dense regions of a supercluster becomes larger than the contiguously imaged area in a survey , then it will only be detected as a single cluster .",
