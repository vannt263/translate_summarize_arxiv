    "graphene has recently attracted intense attention of the research community due to its extraordinary mechanical , electronic and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "one particularly promising research field is that of graphene - enabled wireless communications .",
    "the interconnection of nanosystems , i.e. , integrated systems with a size of a few micrometers , has several applications , such as enabling wireless nanosensor networks  @xcite or wireless communications in network - on - chip environments  @xcite .",
    "however , wireless communications among nanosystems can not be achieved by simply reducing the size of classical metallic antennas down to a few micrometers  @xcite .",
    "this approach presents several drawbacks , such as the low conductivity of nanoscale metallic structures and , especially , the very high resonant frequencies ( up to the infrared and optical ranges ) of micrometer - size antennas , which would result in a large channel attenuation and the difficulty of implementing transceivers operating at such a high frequency .    for these reasons , using micrometer - size metallic antennas to implement wireless communications among nanosystems becomes very challenging .",
    "however , graphene offers a new approach to thz communications thanks to its ability to support the propagation of surface - plasmon polariton ( spp ) waves in the terahertz frequency band  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a graphene rf plasmonic antenna with lateral dimensions of just a few micrometers is predicted to resonate in the terahertz band  @xcite , at a frequency up to two orders of magnitude lower  @xcite and with a higher radiation efficiency with respect to typical thz metallic antennas  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the electrical conductivity of graphene can be tuned by the application of an external electrostatic bias , which allows the design of tunable graphene antennas  @xcite .    in the context of wireless communications among nanosystems , it is important to have a better understanding of graphene antennas by characterizing them towards its practical realization .",
    "one of the main challenges is that , because of its typical resonant frequency ( 1 - 10 thz ) , the antenna must be fed with a suitable terahertz source that can contact it with a reasonable efficiency . in recent years , significant research efforts have been devoted to push the limit of rf sources to higher frequencies , as well as to manufacture optical sources with longer emission wavelengths . following the rf approach , resonance tunneling diodes  @xcite and chains of frequency multipliers  @xcite",
    "provide compact terahertz sources , but they still show a poor efficiency and limited bandwidth . in the optical domain , quantum - cascade lasers ( qcl ) have recently shown a significant progress , extending their operational frequency to 1  thz at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite .",
    "additionally , optical down - conversion of ultrashort laser pulses by means of photoconductor materials has demonstrated a sustained increase in performance in the last decades  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "an ultrashort laser pulse illuminates the surface of a photoconductor generating photocarriers , which move under the influence of an external electrical bias field .",
    "the resulting photocurrent forms a picosecond pulse which , with the help of an antenna attached to the photoconductor converts into free - space terahertz radiation .    among the different approaches for terahertz sources ,",
    "optical down - conversion is one of the best suited for the characterization and demonstration of graphene antennas for two main reasons .",
    "first , such terahertz sources have typically a very high impedance , in the order of several k@xmath0 , which lies in the same order of magnitude of the input impedance of graphene antennas  @xcite , thereby improving impedance matching between both devices .",
    "second , ultrafast photoconductive antennas operate in pulsed mode , which is also the proposed fundamental mechanism for em communications among nanosystems  @xcite . in this paper , we first design a graphene rf plasmonic antenna fed with a photoconductive source and we characterize its radiated terahertz power by means of full - wave em simulations .",
    "our findings show that the terahertz signal radiated by the proposed device has a power in the w range , i.e. , in the same order of magnitude as traditional photoconductive antennas , while having a size up to two orders of magnitude smaller  @xcite .",
    "additionally we estimate the electrical frequency tunability of the antenna .    in",
    "what follows , the proposed device is described .",
    "next , the photoconductive source as well as the antenna are modeled . using these models and by means of full - wave em solvers , the radiated terahertz power by a photoconductor - fed graphene antenna",
    "is estimated as a function of material , illumination and antenna geometry parameters .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] depicts a schematic representation of the proposed graphene dipole antenna fed with a photoconductor . when a femtosecond laser pulse excites the biased semiconductor low - temperature - grown gaas ( lt - gaas )  @xcite with a photon energy greater than its bandgap , electrons and holes are produced at the illumination point in the conduction and valence bands , respectively .",
    "the rapid changes of the density of the photocarriers and their acceleration to the applied voltage between the antenna edges produce a picosecond voltage pulse .",
    "this picosecond pulse excites surface - plasmon polariton ( spp ) waves at the interface between the graphene layer and the dielectric material .",
    "this spp wave propagates along the graphene antenna producing a free - space terahertz radiation .",
    "the resonant frequency of the graphene antenna can be dynamically tuned with the application of an electrostatic voltage @xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , the dielectric material is boron nitride ( h - bn ) in order to achieve a high electron mobility  @xcite .",
    "a high electron mobility is an important requirement for graphene antennas , given its strong dependence with the antenna efficiency , as further discussed in the results section .",
    "finally , the silicon lens shown in fig .  [ fig : sketch ] is a common technique used to improve the directivity of the radiated signal  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a model of the time - dependent voltage generated by a photoconductive source , based on a drude - lorentz model  @xcite .",
    "the trapping time @xmath2 of the photocarriers in lt - gaas is shorter than the recombination time of electrons and holes .",
    "then , the charge density @xmath3 can be obtained as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the generation rate of the carriers as a result of the laser pulse .",
    "the excitation time of the laser pulse is typically in the order of tens of fs .",
    "the velocity of the carriers @xmath6 can be expressed as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the momentum relaxation time and @xmath9 is the local field which can be expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the applied bias field , @xmath12 is the permittivity of the semiconductor material and @xmath13 is a geometric factor .",
    "finally , the polarization @xmath14 caused by the separation of the electron and hole has the following expression :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the recombination time of electrons and holes and @xmath17 is the generated photocurrent density .",
    "based on this fundamental principles and under the assumption that the momentum relaxation time @xmath8 is small , _ khiabani et al . _",
    "@xcite developed an equivalent circuit model using lumped elements that provides accurate estimates in agreement with published experimental data taking into account the underlying physical behavior .",
    "with this model , the time - dependent voltage at the antenna terminals @xmath18 can be expressed as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the impedance of the graphene antenna ( assumed as independent of the frequency ) , @xmath21 is the voltage at the antenna gap ( derived from its equivalent circuit  @xcite ) and @xmath22 is the active area in the semiconductor through which the photocurrent flows .",

    "the graphene antenna considered in this work is composed of a planar graphene dipole , over the same dielectric substrate as the photoconductive source . the choice of graphene for the implementation of this miniaturized antenna is twofold .",
    "first , graphene shows excellent conditions for the propagation of spp waves at frequencies in the terahertz band  @xcite , that is , much lower frequencies than the spp waves observed in noble metals , typically in the optical domain  @xcite .",
    "second , graphene allows to dynamically tune the antenna properties by means of an electrostatic bias  @xcite .",
    "the radiation properties of graphene rf plasmonic antennas are mainly determined by the highly frequency - dependent character of the graphene electrical conductivity .",

    "the intraband conductivity of graphene is expressed with a drude model :    @xmath23\\right]\\frac{i}{\\omega+i\\tau^{-1}},\\label{eq : sigma_graphene}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the relaxation time , @xmath25 is the temperature and @xmath26 is the chemical potential . the relaxation time is obtained as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron mobility in graphene , which depends on the quality of graphene and the dielectric substrate , amongst others , @xmath29 the number of electrons and @xmath30 the fermi velocity .    in order to study the radiation properties of these antennas ,",
    "we consider a simple fabry - perot resonator model . a graphene planar dipole placed on an air - dielectric interface supports transverse - magnetic ( tm ) spp waves with a dispersion relation given by  @xcite    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wavevector and frequency of spp waves , and @xmath34 is the dielectric constant of the substrate .",
    "we observe that the graphene conductivity has a crucial impact in the dispersion relation and , ultimately , in the relationship between wavelength and frequency of spp waves in graphene antennas .",
    "the dispersion relation allows the derivation of the antenna resonant frequency by means of the resonance condition :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the antenna length , @xmath37 is an integer corresponding to the resonance order and @xmath38 is the spp wavelength .",
    "solving the dispersion relation with the first - order ( @xmath39 ) resonance condition allows obtaining the resonant frequency of the graphene antenna for a given antenna length .",
    "two important performance metrics that allow to quantify the radiation properties of plasmonic antennas are the _ plasmon compression factor _ and the _ plasmon propagation length_. the plasmon compression factor @xmath40 is defined as the ratio between the free - space wavelength and the plasmon wavelength : @xmath41 or , equivalently , the ratio between the real part of the spp wavevector and the free - space wavevector @xmath42 / k_0 $ ] . moreover",

    "there is a linear relationship between the antenna radiation efficiency and the plasmon propagation length in the graphene sample ; therefore , a large @xmath47 will result in a high transmitted power by the graphene antenna .",
    "the plasmon propagation length is usually expressed as a function of the plasmon wavelength , yielding the expression @xmath49 / 4 \\pi \\textrm{im}[k_{\\mathrm{spp}}]$ ] .",
    "[ fig : length ] shows the plasmon propagation length in units of the corresponding spp wavelength , with the same parameters as in the previous case .",
    "opposite to the case of the plasmon compression factor , the plasmon has a longer propagation length ( of above one plasmon wavelength ) in the low frequency and high chemical potential potential region .",
    "therefore , there exists a trade - off between the plasmon compression factor and its propagation length : graphene antennas operating at a high frequency and low chemical potential will allow a higher miniaturization with respect to metallic antennas , whereas graphene antennas working a low frequency and high chemical potential will exhibit lower losses and , in consequence , a higher radiation efficiency .",

    "we show next some results of the radiated power by the photoconductive source - fed graphene antenna , as a function of several parameters from both the antenna and the photoconductive source .",
    "we obtain the power of the terahertz pulse generated by the photoconductive source as @xmath50 , where @xmath18 is obtained by solving the model previously presented in section  [ photoconductor ] .",

    "second , the antenna radiation efficiency @xmath54 , which is calculated numerically by means of the full - wave electromagnetic simulator feko .",

    "considering a photoconductive source with the described parameters , the source impedance has a minimum value of 2.24  k@xmath0 , consistently with typical values for photoconductors .",
    "the antenna input impedance is obtained by numerical simulation and it ranges from 0.73  k@xmath0 to 3.15  k@xmath0 , presenting values up to two orders of magnitude higher than comparable metallic antennas .",

    "electron mobilities of graphene over boron nitride of up to 40000  @xmath61/vs have been experimentally observed at room temperature  @xcite ; therefore , the selected values are conservative estimates .",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath63  ev .",
    "we observe that the spectrum of the radiated signal presents clear resonances in the w range , due to the highly frequency - selective behavior of the graphene dipole antenna .",
    "similarly to the behavior observed in metallic antennas , the resonant frequency of a graphene antenna decreases as its length increases , although following a different scaling trend  @xcite .",

    "the results in the considered scenario indicate that , on the one hand , longer antennas resonate at lower frequencies where the power density of the pulses generated by the photoconductive source is mostly concentrated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pulse ] ) , yielding a higher output power . on the other hand",
    ", longer graphene antennas also have a higher impedance mismatch and lower radiation efficiency than their shorter counterparts , which reduces the final radiated power .",
    "overall , the higher output power of photoconductive sources in lower frequencies dominates and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] , the radiated power by graphene antennas increases with the antenna length , reaching a maximum of 1  w for an antenna length of 40  m.    we study next how applying an electrostatic bias voltage to the graphene layer influences the tunable resonant frequency of the antenna as well as the radiated power .",
    "this bias voltage causes a variation in the chemical potential of the graphene layer , which results in a higher conductivity value and , in consequence , the radiation efficiency of the graphene antenna is greatly enhanced .",
    "at the same time , the impedance mismatch is slightly increased and the resonant frequency moves to higher values , where the photoconductive source has a lower output power .",

    "the bias voltage is applied to the photoconductive source along the antenna gap length @xmath36 . increasing the bias voltage ( set to 10",
    "v , 30  v and 50  v , from bottom to top ) also enhances the power radiated by the graphene antenna .",
    "finally , we consider a different antenna geometry that is commonly used in photoconductive antennas due to its wideband behavior , the bowtie antenna .",
    "[ fig : power_bowtie ] shows the average power radiated by graphene bowtie antennas with a fixed length @xmath66  m , electron mobility @xmath62  @xmath61/vs and chemical potential @xmath63  ev , and different widths of 5 , 10 , 15 and 20  m , from bottom to top .",
    "we observe that the radiated power increases with the antenna width , as expected due to its larger area , whereas the antenna resonant frequency is relatively independent of its width .",

    "this paper characterizes by means of a full - wave em solver electrically tunable graphene antennas fed with photoconductive terahertz source , showing a radiated power in the order of 1  w. the characterization of graphene antennas presents two main challenges .",
    "first , graphene antennas have a remarkable higher impedance ( in the order of @xmath68 ) when compared to metallic antennas with an impedance of tens of ohms .",
    "however , in this context , due to the high impedance of photoconductive sources , graphene antennas can operate closer to impedance matching than metallic antennas .",
    "second , graphene antennas have a lower radiation efficiency than metallic antennas due to the low electrical conductivity of graphene compared to a metal .",
    "this effect can be mitigated by using h - bn as a substrate for the graphene antenna , which increases the electron mobility of the graphene sample .",
    "our results show that both effects compensate each other and graphene antennas radiate terahertz pulses with a power in the same order of magnitude than traditional metallic photoconductive antennas .",
    "furthermore , graphene antennas have a size up to two orders of magnitude smaller than metallic antennas radiating at the same frequency , and they can be dynamically tuned by the application of an external bias voltage .",
    "these two unique features of graphene antennas make them a very promising candidate to implement wireless communications among nanosystems .",
