    "based on bethe ansatz solutions of the spin - half heisenberg chain  @xcite , lieb and wu proposed solutions of the one dimensional(1d ) hubbard model as a set of algebraic equations , known as the lieb - wu equations  @xcite . since then , the 1d hubbard model has been considered as an exactly solvable model and is used as a toy model for non - perturbative strongly correlated effects in interacting electron systems .",
    "later , takahashi developed a classification of the lieb - wu equations and introduced a set of non - linear integral equations , known as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) , to replace the lieb - wu equations .",
    "any thermodynamic quantity that relates to the energy spectrum of the 1d hubbard model can be calculated from numerical solutions of the tba equations  @xcite . due to the advent of feshbach resonances and optical lattices in the field of ultra - cold atoms",
    "@xcite , the 1d hubbard model has evolved from a toy model to a paradigm of experimental relevance for strongly correlated particle systems .",

    "the first successful experimental emulation of the hubbard model in optical lattices was achieved by greiner et al .",

    "fermions in optical lattices can open new regimes and routes for understanding many body physics beyond condensed matter models .",
    "for example , mixtures of two - component atoms with different masses introduce spin - dependent hopping amplitudes .",
    "this may effect the stability of the possible quantum phases or even induce new phases .",
    "parallel to the experimental progress of manipulating fermions in optical lattices , recently there have been theoretical studies on the role of an external harmonic potential and its effect on compressibility and double occupancies  @xcite .",
    "the underlying harmonic trapping potential present in all cold - gas experiments causes density to vary across the lattice .",
    "this trapping - potential induced inhomogeneity allows for the spatial coexistence of metallic and insulating phases .",
    "measurements of local and/or global thermodynamic properties allows one to detect these different phases . in the present study",
    ", we use an exactly solvable 1d hubbard model with the local density approximation to extract the thermodynamic quantities in an inhomogeneous system .",
    "our results will contribute to the worldwide experimental efforts in simulating theoretical models of interacting systems using cold atoms in optical lattices . in this paper , we calculate local thermodynamic quantities such as local density , number of double occupation sites , entropy , and various compressibilities for the 1d fermi - hubbard model .",
    "we present our results as a function of the chemical potential , particle number density and total number of atoms .",
    "the chemical potential and particle number density monotonically vary across the lattice due to the external harmonic potential so that the chemical potential can be considered as an effective spatial coordinate . at zero temperature and high temperatures ,",
    "our work is complementary to some of the work presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , we go beyond these studies by systematically extending zero temperature calculations to any finite temperature .",
    "we use both the bethe ansatz and thermodynamic bethe ansatz approaches .",
    "we also present an experimental scheme to deduce the calculated thermodynamic quantities from the column densities .",
    "further , using the local density approximation , we calculate the entropy , compressibility , and total number of double occupation sites as a function of the total number of atoms in the lattice .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our model . in section iii",
    ", we present our zero temperature calculation procedure and the results . in section iv",
    ", we discuss our finite temperature tba calculation and present various thermodynamic quantities for representative values of system parameters . in section",
    "v , we provide an experimental scheme to show the connection between calculated thermodynamic quantities and experimentally measurable column densities followed by the calculation of thermodynamic quantities in a trapped system . finally in section vi , we provide a discussion and draw our conclusions .",

    "we assume that the inter - site tunneling amplitude @xmath2 is independent of the pseudospin ( @xmath3 ) . here",
    "the pseudospin @xmath4 refers to the two hyperfine states of the atoms .",
    "the system of fermions in the lattice can be described by the fermi - hubbard model :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 creates ( destroys ) a fermi atom with pseudospin @xmath3 at lattice site @xmath7 .",

    "the external trapping potential @xmath11 at site @xmath7 for atoms can be treated in the local density approximation by replacing @xmath10 by @xmath12 .",
    "the on - site interaction @xmath13 is sensitive to both laser intensity and the _ s_-wave scattering length of the two fermi species .",
    "as @xmath13 is linearly proportional to the _ s_-wave scattering length , it can be tuned to negative or positive values by exploiting feshbach resonances . in the present study",
    ", we consider the repulsive hubbard model so that @xmath13 can have only positive values . in cold - gas experiments ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude is controlled by the intensity of the standing laser waves . in current experimental setups ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude is exponentially sensitive to the laser intensity while the on - site interaction is weakly sensitive .",
    "thus , @xmath14 can be controlled by a single parameter : the laser intensity .",
    "further , standing laser waves allow for a variation of the dimensionality of the system",
    ". a reduced dimensionality is achieved by freezing the atomic motion in certain directions .",
    "experimentally , the 1d geometry can be realized by a strong confinement in the transverse direction with an additional periodic potential applied along the other direction .",

    "<S> we calculate several thermodynamic quantities for repulsively interacting one dimensional fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the hubbard model at both zero and finite temperature using the bethe ansatz method . for arbitrary values of the chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the particle number density , the double occupancy , various compressibilities , and the entropy as a function of temperature and interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these thermodynamic quantities show a characteristic behavior so that measurements of these quantities can be used as a detection of temperature , the metal - insulator transition , and metallic and insulating phases in the trap environment . </S>",
    "<S> further , we discuss an experimental scheme to extract these thermodynamic quantities from the column density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy and the compressibility of the entire trapped atomic cloud also reveal characteristic features indicating whether insulating and/or metallic phases coexist in the trap . </S>"
