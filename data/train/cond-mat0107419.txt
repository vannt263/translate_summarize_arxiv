    "the construction of the model , that follows a hierarchical rule commonly used in deterministic fractals @xcite , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the network is built in an iterative fashion , each iteration repeating and reusing the elements generated in the previous steps as follows :    _ step 0 : _ we start from a single node , that we designate as the _ root _ of the graph .    _ step 1 : _ we add two more nodes , and connect each of them to the root .",
    "_ step 2 : _ we add two units of three nodes , each unit identical to the network created in the previous iteration ( step 1 ) , and we connect each of the _ bottom _ nodes ( see figure 1 ) of these two units to the root .",
    "that is , the root will gain four more new links .",
    "_ step 3 : _ we add two units of nine nodes each , identical to the units generated in the previous iteration , and connect all eight bottom nodes of the two new units to the root .    these rules can be easily generalized .",
    "indeed , step @xmath4 would involve the following operation :    _ step @xmath4 : _ add two units of @xmath5 nodes each , identical to the network created in the previous iteration ( step @xmath6 ) , and connect each of the @xmath7 bottom nodes of these two units to the root of the network .",
    "thanks to its deterministic and discrete nature , the model described above can be solved exactly . to show its scale - free nature , in the following we concentrate on the degree distribution , @xmath8 .",
    "the tail of the degree distribution is determined by the most connected nodes , or hubs .",
    "clearly the biggest hub is the root , and the next two hubs are the roots of the two units added to the network in the last step .",
    "therefore , in order to capture the tail of the distribution , it is sufficient to focus on the hubs .    in step",
    "@xmath9 the degree of the most connected hub , the root , is @xmath10 . in the next iteration",
    "two copies of this hub will appear in the two newly added units .",
    "as we iterate further , in the @xmath4th step @xmath11 copies of this hub will be present in the network .",
    "however , the two newly created copies will not increase their degree after further iterations . therefore ,",
    "after @xmath4 iterations there are @xmath12 nodes with degree @xmath10 .",
    "since spaces between degrees grow with increrasing @xmath0 , the exponent of the degree distribution can be calculated using the cumulative degree disctribution .",
    "the tail of the cumulative degree distribution , determined by the hubs , follows @xmath13 thus the degree exponent is @xmath14 the origin of this scaling behavior can be understood by inspecting the model s construction .",
    "indeed , at any moment we have a hierarchy of hubs , highly connected nodes which are a common component of scale - free networks .",
    "the root is always the largest hub .",
    "however , at any step there are two hubs whose connectivity is roughly a half of the root s connectivity , corresponding to the roots of the two units added at step @xmath6 .",
    "there are six even smaller hubs , with connectivity @xmath15 , corresponding to the root of the units added at time @xmath16 , and so on .",
    "this hierarchy of hubs is responsible for the network s scale - free topology .",
    "the model introduced above offers a deterministic construction of a scale - free network .",
    "one of its interesting properties is its apparent self - similarity . on the other hand , while the networks generated at step @xmath4 and @xmath6 have an identical large - scale topology , self - similarity is not complete . the special role played by the root , the major hub in the network , violates complete self - similarity .",
    "indeed , the root keeps a detailed record of the system size through the number of links it has .",
    "such global information is never present in a local element of a fractal , the common example of a self - similar object .",
    "this unique feature of our construction reflects a common property of all scale - free networks , rooted in the nonlocal growth rule that generates scale - free systems . indeed , in stochastic models the probability that a node connects to an existing node in the system contains implicitly the information about the whole system .",
    "while the connectivity of the hub in a stochastic network is not equal to the system size , it typically varies as a simple function of @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , here the largest hub , the root of our construction , keeps track of the system size in a trivial way , as @xmath18 of the nodes are linked to it .",
    "the proposed model generates a network with a fixed @xmath19 degree exponent .",
    "however , one can easily modify the model to change the scaling exponent by varying the number of links connected to the root at each step .",
    "similarly , by definition the model discussed here has a zero clustering coefficient @xcite , as it does not generate triangles of connected nodes .",
    "it is easy to change the rules , without changing the scaling exponent , to obtain a network that displays nonzero clustering .",
    "indeed , a version in which each two copies of the original hub are connected has a finite clustering coefficient .",
    "these and further variants of the model will be discussed in forthcoming publications .    a crucial unique property of the model is its hierarchical structure .",
    "it is not clear whether the hierarchy seen in this model is a unique property of its construction , or it is an intrinsic property of all scale - free networks . uncovering the elements of the hierarchy could be an important future task in our understanding of scale - free networks .",
    "the present model explicitly builds such a hierarchical construction into the network , as at each iteration we connect nodes to each other in a hierarchical fashion .    in conclusion",
    ", we introduced a simple model that allows us to construct a deterministic scale - free network .",
    "we have shown that the scaling exponent characterizing the tail of the @xmath8 distribution can be calculated analytically .",
    "an important feature of the model is its hierarchical topology , as at each iteration it combines identical elements to generate a larger network .",
    "the method that lead to the construction of the network naturally lends itself to immediate generalizations , leading to structures that are similar in spirit , but rather different in detail , allowing us to generate networks with different scaling exponents and connectivity .",
