    "the effect is definitely strongest in absorption , but does span the entire width of the line and extends quite far to the red side of the line .",
    "u mon ( hd 59693 ) is an rv - tau type variable star with a k0ibpv spectral type ( simbad ) .",
    "there is archival data from february 7th and 8th 2006 shown in figure [ fig : swp - astar - esp ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 line is fairly wide with an amplitude of roughly three times the continuum .",
    "there is a clear , mildly red - shifted absorptive component that creates an asymmetric , double peaked profile .",
    "the spectropolarimetric effect is clearly complex , being roughly 0.5% in stokes u at peak amplitude .",
    "this star is also has a relatively narrow effect around the absorptive component .",
    "89 her ( hd 163506 , hr 6685 ) is a post - agb star of spectral type f2ibe ( simbad ) .",
    "there is archival data from february 7th 2006 shown in figure [ fig : swp - astar - esp ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 line has a very wide , strong absorptive component and a small red - shifted emissive component .",
    "the spectropolarimetric effect is complex , being antisymmetric in q and monotonic in u with a very large amplitude of over 3%(-3% q , -1.5% u ) .",
    "this polarization effect is clearly strongest in the absorptive component , though the stokes u spectrum does show a gradual decrease toward zero extending to the red - shifted component of the line .",
    "all of these detections in various stellar types show that there are a wealth of spectropolarimetric morphologies and that the polarization in the absorptive components must be understood in order to make meaningful constraints on the circumstellar environment .",
    "+    +        the be and emission line spectropolarimetry shows remarkably different spectropolarimetric profiles when compared to the herbig ae / be stars even with the same shape and magnitude h@xmath1 line profile .",
    "the be signatures are smaller in magnitude and typically span the entire line ( 10/30 ) .",
    "the morphology of the be spectropolarimetry does not seem to be only tied to the strong absorptive components of the line directly because the polarization effect is present across the entire line .",
    "there is some morphological change tied to the presence or strength of the absorption in four of the 10 broad spectropolarimetric profiles , but this has a smaller amplitude than detected in the herbig ae / be systems .",
    "these small amplitude effects would not be observed at lower spectral resolution and deserve more detailed analysis .",
    "systems with both strong and weak absorption in both strong and weak h@xmath1 lines showed the broad spectropolarimetric effects .",
    "however , be stars with either symmetric unobscured emission lines or absorption lines did not show any detectable polarization changes .",
    "herbig ae / be stars in contrast show a polarization that is much stronger and is directly tied to the absorptive component of the line . in windy systems with",
    "p - cygni type line profiles the polarization can be over 2% in the blue - shifted absorption trough . in many cases , especially ab aurigae and mwc 480 , the polarization at the emissive peak is identical to the continuum polarization within the 0.1% noise . in both be and hae / be stars , there are a wealth of spectropolarimetric morphologies even for the same line type .",
    "in other stellar types , such as post - agb and rv - tau type stars , there is very significant absorptive polarization with a complex morphology .",
    "a direct comparison between six different systems is shown in figure [ fig : swp - sidebyside ] . though all stars have h@xmath1 lines with absorption features , very different spectropolarimetric morphologies are seen .",
    "mwc 158 and mwc 480 illustrate the typical herbig ae / be effects .",
    "the polarization changes are very strong in the absorptive components of the line and the qu - loop morphologies are dominated by the absorptive regions .",
    "mwc 143 is a be star that shows a broad clear spectropolarimetric signature that is wider than the emission line itself and shows no significant deviation from this broad spectropolarimetric trend in the central absorption .",
    "this is a `` disky '' system that shows no effect in absorption , a clear change from the typical herbig ae / be systems .",
    "the be star @xmath13 col illustrates the 5/30 stars that show complex , more narrow effects that have not been seen in be stars at lower spectral resolution or lower precision .",
    "51 oph is classified as a herbig ae / be star but shows antisymmetric , lower - amplitude components similar to be stars .",
    "there is not a pronounced effect in the absorptive component of the line .",
    "this is unlike most of the herbig be stars such as hd 58647 which show a strong spectropolarimetric signature only in the very center of the central absorption .",
    "the star 3 pup is an a - type star not in either be or haebe classes and shows a very strong , complex signature that is stable during the epochs of our observations .",
    "the polarization signature is as broad as the emission line and has many complex components .",
    "comparison of these three stars highlights the range of effects seen in this survey .",
    "the detections show that , although the broad spectropolarimetric effect seems common ( 10/30 ) in be and other b - type emission - line stars , the effect is certainly not common in the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "one common thread in those herbig ae / be stars was the consistent presence of spectropolarimetric signatures in and around absorptive components of the h@xmath1 line . in many of the stars , there were very large polarization changes in absorptive components while the wavelengths of strongest emission showed no polarization deviations from continuum .",
    "the be and emission - line stars do have their own morphological complexities that are worth investigating , and 5 of 30 detections that do not follow the broad morphological description and 4 of 10 `` broad '' signatures show additional absorptive effects .",
    "these more complex detections , in some cases , look very similar to some herbig ae / be detections . now that a very clear morphological difference has been established between herbig ae / be stars and other emission - line stars , a new theory will be explored that may better fit the  polarization - in - absorption \" morphology of the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "this paper presents a large amount of hivis observations taken on over 100 nights on 29 herbig ae / be stars , 30 be and emission - line targets as well as several alternatively classified objects to compile a linear spectropolarimetric survey far larger in scope than any survey performed to date .",
    "archival data as well as our own observations with the espadons spectropolarimeter were used to supplement the hivis survey and to prove the robustness of the combined dataset .",
    "the espadons observations represent an order - of - magnitude gain in resolution from any survey done to date .",
    "the observing campaign from 2004 to 2008 was outlined in section 2 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the herbig ae / be stars showed , as expected , a wealth of line morphologies .",
    "the h@xmath1 line of these stars is typically strong and quite variable .",
    "the emission lines can be a few to thirty times continuum with many different absorptive components on top of the emission .",
    "spectroscopic measurements for these stars over many time - scales were presented and discussed .",
    "a few short - term variability studies were reported illustrating the dynamic circumstellar environment in these stars .",
    "current theories of spectropolarimetric line profiles , based on disk or envelope scattering effects were discussed in section 3 .",
    "the current disk - scattering theory predicts symmetric , broad , double - peaked spectropolarimetric signatures in the orbiting thin - disk case .",
    "the corresponding qu - loops show position - angle changes that are equally broad in wavelength . in the case of outward radial motion ,",
    "the disk - scattering theory predicts a shift of the spectropolarimetric profiles toward the red side of the spectral line .",
    "the depolarization theory is essentially a dilution of continuum polarization by unpolarized emission .",
    "this effect produces broad signatures that are roughly inversely proportional to the amount of emission .      in section 4 ,",
    "the spectropolarimetric survey of the herbig ae / be stars was presented .",
    "the survey showed that roughly two thirds of the haebe stars showed polarization effects in the absorptive components of the h@xmath1 line .",
    "both the windy - type and disky - type stars showed this polarization - in - absorption effect in the blue - shifted or line - center absorptive components respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the effect was typically 0.1% to 2% with several stars showing complex morphologies and complex geometries in qu - space .",
    "only one star , hd 179218 , showed a spectropolarimetric effect across the entire h@xmath1 line .",
    "these observations are difficult to explain using current scattering theories .",
    "the depolarization effect causes a broad , monotonic change in polarization that is roughly inversely proportional to emission and is a linear extension in qu - space .",
    "the disk - scattering effect shows broad , symmetric morphology for orbiting material and a shift toward red wavelengths for out - flowing material .",
    "both of these effects do not fit the observed morphology of polarization - in - absorption on the blue - shifted side of the windy - stars or the polarization - in - central - absorption - only for the disky - stars .",
    "the amplitude of the observed effects is also a consideration .",
    "scattering theory has no natural amplitude , but most of the detections fall in the 0.3% to 1.5% range .",
    "a survey of 30 be and emission - line stars was performed and presented in section 5 .",
    "this was also complemented by studies of 6 other - type stars such as post - agb and rv - tau types , as well as an in - depth look at 3-pup .",
    "these be and emission - line stars had a very different type of spectropolarimetric morphology . in 10 of 30 stars there was a broad , monotonic spectropolarimetric signature present across the entire h@xmath1 line .",
    "this type of signature is typical of the depolarization effect .",
    "however , in these 10 broad detections , four showed more complex morphologies in addition to the simple depolarization tied to absorptive components of the emission line . in another 5 of 30 stars there were antisymmetric or other more complex spectropolarimetric signatures that are inconsistent with depolarization theory .",
    "this smaller survey of be stars is in good agreement with the large collection of previous work done to date on these stars at lower resolution .",
    "the broad spectropolarimetric morphology is reproduced , but the higher resolution , higher signal - to - noise and larger sample of this survey shows that there are still some additional uncertainties about the exact form of the spectropolarimetric effects in some of these stars .",
    "one third of the detections ( 5/15 ) do not fit the simple depolarization framework .",
    "four of 10 broad signatures show significant deviations of the line from the simple depolarization morphology in absorptive components that would only have been seen at high resolution with high signal - to - noise .",
    "the inability of scattering theories to fit the  polarization - in - absorption \" seen in the herbig ae / be stars is good evidence for intrinsic absorptive polarization effects .",
    "this survey has already inspired optical pumping calculations ( kuhn et al . 2007 ) that demonstrate such a mechanism .",
    "detailed models based on any paradigm assuming any realistic circumstellar environments do not yet predict spectropolarimetric line profiles .",
    "the best example of this is the  polarization - in - absorption \" seen primarily in the herbig ae / be stars or the more complicated profiles observed in be and other emission - line stars .",
    "unusual linear spectropolarimetric profiles were seen in both haebe and be classes as well as in other a - type stars such as 3 pup and @xmath15 aur .",
    "an intrinsic absorptive polarization mechanism seems essential for explaining many of these observations as the herbig ae / be detections are clearly inconsistent with disk - scattering theories .",
    "however , as this large survey shows , there is a broad range of linear spectropolarimetric `` signatures '' in these stellar systems waiting to be deciphered .",
    "this program was partially supported by the nsf ast-0123390 grant , the university of hawaii and the airforce research labs ( afrl ) .",
    "some of this research used the facilities of the canadian astronomy data centre operated by the national research council of canada with the support of the canadian space agency .",
    "this archive was very helpful by providing the released espadons data .",
    "this program also made use of observations obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council of canada , the institut national des sciences de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "these cfht observations were reduced with the dedicated software package libre - esprit made available by j. -f .",
    "the simbad data base operated by cds , strasbourg , france was very useful for compiling stellar properties .",
