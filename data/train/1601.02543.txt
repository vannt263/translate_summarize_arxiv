    "in india , ( a ) a large percentage of the population is not english literate ; ( b ) they can speak their language but might not be able to write or read the same language ; ( c ) people have access to mobile phone thanks to the proliferation of mobile phones in the last couple of years ; ( d ) no major access to broadband or internet or computers ; ( e ) sending sms in local indian language is still cumbersome even to the people who can write in their language ; and ( f ) majority of this population are in need of some transactional information ( travel inquiry , news , stock quotes , yellow pages etc ) or the other very often . in total sum , in the indian context , there exists a huge opportunity for speech based solutions especially if they can address usage by masses .",
    "speech based solutions require no marketing and will catch like wild fire if the transaction completion rate is high .",
    "the success of a speech solution lies in being able to build an automatic speech recognition ( asr ) based system which is robust , works for large populations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and is able to service the masses in indian languages .",
    "the challenge however lies in the fact that there are too many languages , even more dialects that makes even a menu based speech solution untamed in the indian scenario .",
    "there are several commercial menu based asr systems available around the world for a significant number of languages and interestingly speech solution based on these asr are being used with good success in the western part of the globe @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "typically , a menu based asr system restricts user to speak from a pre - defined closed set of words for enabling a transaction .",
    "however , these commercially viable menu based asr systems can not be directly plugged into the indian scenarios and for indian languages for mass use because of several idiosyncrasies of the indian conditions . the case in point",
    "is the observation that though speech solution is an apt solution in the indian context , there is no speech solution of any reasonable repute in deployment for indian languages .",
    "some of the reasons for this are ( a ) there are officially 22 different languages in india and a larger variety of dialect variants ; ( b ) indian languages have not been as richly studied compared to the western languages especially english ; ( c ) there is a large variation in accents of the speakers ; ( d ) it is very difficult to fine tune and deploy asr system developed primarily for western languages in india ; ( e ) indian telephone lines are far more noisy compared to the western counterparts .",
    "this leads to the situation where using the asr system , developed for western languages and conditions , for indian conditions and languages needs significant innovation and changes to make it suitable for use in india .",
    "variations in the dialects and accents , high cost associated with creating the speech corpora etc pose practical difficulties in developing an speech recognition system for use in india .",
    "this large diversity in languages and the large number of speech solution application domains ( travel inquiry , news , stock quotes , yellow pages etc ) calls for a strategy which can provide a workable system .",
    "there has been continuous effort in developing speech recognition for different indian languages to address different domains @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    before commercial deployment of a speech solution",
    "it is imperative to have a quantitative measure of the performance of the speech solution which is primarily based on the speech recognition accuracy of the speech engine used .",
    "generally , the recognition performance of any speech recognition based solution is quantitatively evaluated by putting it to actual use by the people who are the intended users and then analyzing the logs to identify successful and unsuccessful transactions .",
    "this evaluation is then used to identifying any further improvement in the speech recognition based solution to better the overall transaction completion rates .",
    "this process of evaluation is both time consuming and expensive .",
    "for evaluation one needs to identify a set of users and also identify the set of actual usage situations and perform the test .",
    "it is also important that the set of users are able to use the system with ease meaning that even in the test conditions the performance of the system , should be good , while this can not usually be guaranteed this aspect of keeping the user experience good makes it necessary to employ a wizard of oz ( woz ) approach .",
    "typically this requires a human agent in the loop during actual speech transaction where the human agent corrects any mis - recognition by actually listening to the conversation between the human user and the machine without the user knowing that there is a human agent in the loop .",
    "the use of woz is another expense in the testing a speech solution .",
    "all this makes testing a speech solution an expensive and time consuming procedure .    in this paper ,",
    "we describe a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without actual people using the system as is usually done .",
    "we then show how this method was adopted to evaluate a speech recognition based solution as a case study .",
    "this is the main contribution of the paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ fig : nodes ] shows the schematic of a typical menu based speech solution having @xmath0 nodes . at each node",
    "there are a set of words that the user is expected to speak and the system is supposed to recognize . in this particular schematic , at the entry node the user can speak any of the @xmath1 words , namely @xmath2 or @xmath3 or @xmath4 or @xmath5 ; @xmath1 is usually called the perplexity of the node in the speech literature . the larger the @xmath1 the more the perplexity and higher the confusion and hence lower the recognition accuracies . in most commercial speech solutions",
    "the perplexity is kept very low , typically a couple of words . once the word at the entry node has been recognized ( say word @xmath6 has been recognized ) , the system moves on to the second node where the active list of words to be recognized could be one of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ...",
    "@xmath10 if the perplexity at the @xmath11 node is @xmath12 .",
    "this is carried on to the third node .",
    "a transaction is termed successful _ if and only if _",
    "the recognition at each of the three nodes is correct .",
    "for example , typically in a banking speech solution the entry node could expect someone to speak among /_credit",
    "card_// represents the spoken equivalent of the written word @xmath2 .",
    "] , /_savings account_/ , /_current account_/ , /_loan",
    "product_/ , /_demat_/ , and /_mutual fund transfer_/ which has a perplexity of @xmath13 .",
    "once a person speaks , say , /_savings account_/ and is recognized correctly by the system , at the second node it could be /_account balance_/ or /_cheque_/ or",
    "/_last @xmath14 transactions_/ ( perplexity @xmath0 ) and at the third node ( say , on recognition of /_cheque_/ ) it could be /_new cheque book request_/ , /_cheque",
    "status_/ , and /_stop",
    "cheque request_/ ( perplexity @xmath0 ) .",
    "though we will not dwell on this , it is important to note that an error in recognition at the entry node is more expensive than a recognition error at a lower node .",
    "based on the call flow , and the domain the system can have several nodes for completion of a transaction .",
    "typical menu based speech solutions strive for a @xmath0 - @xmath14 level nodes to make it usable . in any speech based solution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sr ] ) first the spoken utterance is hypothesized into a sequence of phonemes using the acoustic models .",
    "since the phoneme recognition accuracy is low , instead of choosing one phoneme it identifies l - best ( typically @xmath15 ) matching phonemes .",
    "this phone lattice is then matched with all the expected words ( language model ) at that node to find the best match . for a node with perplexity @xmath1 the constructed phoneme lattice of the spoken utterance",
    "is compared with the phoneme sequence representation of all the @xmath1 words ( through the lexicon which is one of he key components of a speech recognition system ) .",
    "the hypothesized phone lattice is declared one of the @xmath1 words depending on the closeness of the phoneme lattice to the phoneme representation of the @xmath1 words .",
    "we hypothesize that we can identify the performance of a menu based speech system by identifying the possible confusion among all the words that are active at a given node .",
    "if active words at a given node are phonetically similar it becomes difficult for the speech recognition system to distinguish them which in turn leads to recognition errors .",
    "we used levenshtein distance @xcite , @xcite a well known measure to analyze and identify the confusion among the active words at a given node .",
    "this analysis gives a list of all set of words that have a high degree of confusability among them ; this understanding can be then used to ( a ) restructure the set of active words at that node and/or ( b ) train the words that can be confused by using a larger corpus of speech data .",
    "this allows the speech recognition engine to be equipped to be able to distinguish the confusing words better .",

    "[ fig : nodes1 ] .",
    "the system enables user to get information on five different services , namely , ( a ) arrival of a given train at a given station , ( b ) departure of a given train at a given station , ( c ) ticket availability on a given date in a given train between two stations , and class , ( d ) fare in a given class in a given train between two stations , and ( e ) pnr status . at the first recognition node ( node-1 ) , there are one or more active words corresponding to each of these services .",
    "for example , for selecting the service fare , the user can speak among /_kiraya jankari_/ , /_kiraya_/",
    ", /_fare_/. similarly , for selecting service ticket availability , user can speak /_upalabdhata jankari_/ or /_ticket availability_/ or /_upalabdhata_/.",
    "generally the perplexity at a node is greater than on equal to the number of words that need to be recognized at that node .    in this manner",
    "each of the services could have multiple words or phrases that can mean the same thing and the speaker could utter any of these words to refer to that service .",
    "the sum of all the possible different ways in which a service can be called ( @xmath16 ) summed over all the @xmath14 services gives the perplexity ( @xmath17 ) at that node , namely , @xmath18 the speech recognition engine matches the phoneme lattice of the spoken utterance with all the @xmath17 words which are active . the active word ( one among the @xmath17 words ) with highest likelihood score is the recognized word . in order to avoid low likelihood recognitions a threshold",
    "is set so that even the best likelihood wordis returned only if the likelihood score is greater than the predefined threshold .",
    "completion of a service requires recognitions at several nodes with different perplexity at each node . clearly depending on the type of service that the user is wanting to use ; the user has to go through different number of recognition nodes .",
    "for example , to complete the arrival service it is required to pass through @xmath0 recognition nodes namely ( a ) selection of a service , ( b ) selection of a train name and ( c ) selection of the railway station . while the perplexity ( the words that are active ) at the service selection node is fixed the perplexity at the station selection node could depend on the selection of the train name at an earlier node .",
    "for example , if the selected train stops at @xmath19 stations , then the perplexity at the station selection node will be @xmath20 .",
    "however , if train stops at a fewer number of stations , then the perplexity at the station selection node is less than @xmath19 .    for confusability analysis at each of the node",
    ", we have used the levenshtein distance @xcite or the edit distance as is well known in computer science literature .",
    "we found that the utterances /_sahi_/",
    "and /_galat_/ have @xmath21% recognition .",
    "these words sahi is represented by the string of phonemes in the lexicon as s aa hh i and the word galat is represented as the phoneme sequence g l ax tt in the lexicon .",
    "we identified the edit distance between these two words sahi and galat and used that distance measure as the threshold that is able to differentiate any two words ( say @xmath22 ) .",
    "so if the distance between any two active words at a given recognition node is lower than the threshold @xmath22 , then there is a greater chance that those two active words could get confused ( one word could be recognized as the other which is within a distance of @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are ways in which this possible misrecognition words could be avoided .",
    "the easiest way is to make sure that these two words together are not active at a given recognition node .",
    ".list of active words at node 1 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can derive from the analysis of the active words that _ fare _ and _ pnr _ can not coexist as active words at the same node .",
    "the result of the analysis was to remove the active words _ fare _ and _ pnr _ at that node .",
    "when the speech system was actually tested by giving speech samples , @xmath23 out of @xmath24 instances of /_pnr_/ was was recognized as _ fare _ and vice - versa .",
    "similarly @xmath25 out of @xmath24 instances /_pnr_/ was misrecognized as _",
    "prasthan _ and vice versa this confusion is expected as can be seen from the edit distance analysis of the active words in the table [ tab : matrix ] .",
    "this modified active word list ( removal of _ fare _ and _ pnr _ ) increased the recognition accuracy at the service node ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nodes1 ] ) by as much as @xmath26% .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out at other recognition nodes and the active word list was suitably modified to avoid possible confusion between active word pair .",
    "this analysis and modification of the list of active words at a node resulted in a significant improvement in the transaction completion rate .",
    "we will present more experimental results in the final paper .",
    "in this paper we proposed a methodology to identify words that could lead to confusion at any given node of a speech recognition based system .",
    "we used edit distance as the metric to identifying the possible confusion between the active words .",
    "we showed that this metric can be used effectively to enhance the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people test .",
