    "the aim of this article is to study two - player zero - sum general repeated games with signals ( sometimes called `` stochastic games with partial observation '' ) . at each stage",
    ", each player chooses some action in a finite set .",
    "this generates a stage reward then a new state and new signals are randomly chosen through a transition probability depending on the current state and actions , and with finite support .",
    "shapley @xcite studied the special case of standard stochastic games where the players observe , at each stage , the current state and the past actions .",
    "there are several ways to analyze these games .",
    "we will distinguish two approaches : borelian evaluation and uniform value .    in this article",
    ", we will mainly use a point of view coming from the literature on determinacy of multistage games ( gale and stewart @xcite ) .",
    "one defines a function , called _ evaluation _ , on the set of plays ( infinite histories ) and then studies the existence of a value in the normal form game where the payoff is given by the expectation of the evaluation , with respect to the probability induced by the strategies of the players .",
    "several evaluations will be considered .    in the initial model of gale and stewart @xcite of two - person zero - sum multistage game with perfect information",
    ", there is no state variable .",
    "the players choose , one after the other , an action from a finite set and both observe the previous choices .",
    "given a subset @xmath1 of the set of plays ( in this framework : infinite sequences of actions ) , player @xmath2 wins if and only if the actual play belongs to the set @xmath1 : the payoff function is the indicator function of @xmath1 .",
    "gale and stewart proved that the game is determined : either player @xmath2 has a winning strategy or player @xmath3 has a winning strategy , in the case where @xmath1 is open or closed with respect to the product topology .",
    "this result was then extended to more and more general classes of sets until martin @xcite proved the determinacy for every borel set .",
    "when @xmath1 is an arbitrary subset of plays , gale and stewart @xcite showed that the game may be not determined .    in @xmath4 ,",
    "blackwell @xcite studied the case ( still without state variable ) where the players play simultaneously and are told their choices . due to the lag of information ,",
    "the determinacy problem is not well defined .",
    "instead , one investigates the probability that the play belongs to some subset @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is a @xmath5-set , a countable intersection of open sets , blackwell proved that there exists a real number @xmath6 , the _ value _ of the game , such that for each @xmath7 , player @xmath2 can ensure that the probability of the event : `` the play is in @xmath1 '' is greater than @xmath8 , whereas player @xmath3 can ensure that it is less than @xmath9 .",
    "the extension of this result to shapley s model ( i.e. , with a state variable ) was done by maitra and sudderth .",
    "they focus on the specific evaluation where the payoff is the largest stage reward obtained infinitely often .",
    "they prove the existence of a value , called _ limsup value _",
    ", in the countable framework @xcite , in the borelian framework @xcite and in a finitely additive setting @xcite . in the first two cases , they assume some finiteness of the action set ( for one of the players ) .",
    "their result especially applies to finite stochastic games where the global payoff is the limsup of the mean expected payoff .",
    "blackwell s existence result was generalized by martin @xcite to any borel - measurable evaluation , whereas maitra and sudderth @xcite extended it further to stochastic games in the finitely additive setting .",
    "in all these results , the players observe the past actions and the current state .    another notion used in the study of stochastic games ( where a play generates a sequence of rewards ) is the uniform value where some uniformity condition is required .",
    "basically , one looks at the largest amount that can be obtained by a given strategy for a family of evaluations ( corresponding to longer and longer games ) .",
    "there are examples where the uniform value does not exist : lehrer and sorin @xcite describe such a game with a countable set of states and only one player , having a finite action set .",
    "on the other hand , rosenberg , solan and vieille @xcite proved the existence of the uniform value in partial observation markov decision processes ( one player ) when the set of states and the set of actions are finite .",
    "this result was extended by renault @xcite to general action space .",
    "the case of stochastic games with standard signaling , that is , where the players observes the state and the actions played has been treated by mertens and neyman @xcite .",
    "they proved the existence of a uniform value for games with a finite set of states and finite sets of actions .",
    "in fact , their proof also shows the existence of a value for the limsup of the mean payoff , as studied in maitra and sudderth and that both values are equal .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide new existence results when the players are observing only signals on state and actions . in section  [ model ] , we define the model and present several specific borel evaluations .",
    "we then prove the existence of a value in games where the evaluation of a play is the largest stage reward obtained along it , called @xmath10 evaluation and study several examples where the limsup value does not exist .",
    "section  [ secsymmetric ] is the core of this paper .",
    "we focus on the case of symmetric signaling structure : multistage games where both players have the same information at each stage , and prove that a value exists for any borel evaluation . for the proof , we introduce an auxiliary game where the players observe the state and the actions played and we apply the generalization of martin s result to standard stochastic games . finally , in section  [ uniform ] , we introduce formally the notion of uniform value and prove its existence in recursive games with nonnegative payoffs .",
    "given a set @xmath11 , we denote by @xmath12 the set of probabilities with finite support on @xmath11 .",

    "let @xmath51 .",
    "assuming perfect recall , a _ behavioral strategy _ for player 1 is a sequence @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , the strategy at stage @xmath41 , is a mapping from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , with the interpretation that @xmath56 is the lottery on actions used by player 1 after @xmath57 . in particular , the strategy @xmath58 at stage @xmath2 is simply a mapping from @xmath19 to @xmath55 giving the law of the first action played by player 1 as a function of his initial signal .",
    "similarly , a _",

    "we denote by @xmath63 and @xmath64 the sets of behavioral strategies of player 1 and player 2 , respectively .",
    "if for every @xmath47 and @xmath57 , @xmath56 is a dirac measure then the strategy is _ pure_. a _ mixed strategy _ is a distribution over pure strategies .",
    "note that since the initial distribution @xmath30 and the transition @xmath22 have finite support and the sets of actions are finite , there exists a finite subset @xmath65 such that for all strategies @xmath66 the set of histories that are reached at stage @xmath41 with a positive probability is included in @xmath67 .",
    "hence , no additional measurability assumptions on the strategies are needed .",
    "it is standard that a pair of strategies @xmath68 induces a probability @xmath69 on the set of _ plays _ @xmath70 endowed with the @xmath71-algebra @xmath72 generated by the cylinders above the elements of @xmath73 .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the corresponding expectation .",
    "historically , the first models of repeated games assumed that both @xmath75 and @xmath76 determine @xmath77 ( standard signalling on the moves also called `` full monitoring '' ) .    a _ stochastic game _ corresponds to the case where in addition the state is known : both @xmath78 and @xmath76 contain @xmath79 .",
    "a _ game with incomplete information _ corresponds to the case where in addition the state is fixed : @xmath80 , but not necessarily known by the players .",
    "several extensions have been proposed and studied ; see , for example , neyman and sorin @xcite in particular chapters  3 , 21 , 25 , 28 .",
    "it has been noticed since kohlberg and zamir @xcite that games with incomplete information , when the information is _ symmetric _",
    ": @xmath81 and contains @xmath77 , could be analyzed by introducing an auxiliary stochastic game .",
    "however , the state variable in this auxiliary stochastic game is no longer @xmath82 but the ( common ) conditional probability on @xmath11 given the signals , that can be computed by the players : namely the law of @xmath46 in @xmath83 .",
    "since then , this approach has been extended ; see , for example , sorin @xcite , ghosh et al . @xcite and the analysis in the current article shows that general repeated games with symmetric information are the natural extension of standard stochastic games .",
    "we now describe several ways to evaluate each play and the corresponding concepts .",
    "we follow the multistage game determinacy literature and define an evaluation function @xmath84 on infinite plays . then we study the existence of the value of the normal form game @xmath85 .",
    "we will consider especially four evaluations : the general borel evaluation , the sup evaluation , the limsup evaluation and the limsup - mean evaluation .",

    "given an evaluation @xmath84 , the game @xmath87 has a _ value _ if @xmath88 this real number is called the value and denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "given a repeated game @xmath25 , we will study several specific evaluations defined through the stage payoff function @xmath26 .",
    "the first evaluation is the supremum evaluation where a play is evaluated by the largest payoff obtained along it .",

    "the specificity of this evaluation is that for every @xmath47 , the maximal stage payoff obtained before @xmath41 is a lower bound of the evaluation on the current play .",
    "we prove that the @xmath0 value always exists .",
    "[ sup ] a repeated game @xmath98 with the @xmath0 evaluation has a value @xmath97 .    for the proof , we use the following result .",

    "then the normal form game @xmath108 has a value @xmath6 .",
    "a more general version of this proposition can be found in mertens , sorin and zamir @xcite ( part a , exercise 2 , section  1.f , page  10 ) .",

    "finally , the sequence @xmath102 is increasing to @xmath112    it follows from proposition  [ ff ] that the game @xmath87 with the @xmath0 evaluation has a value .",
    "several authors have especially focused on the @xmath113 evaluation and the @xmath113-mean evaluation .",

    "the limsup - mean evaluation is closely related to the limsup evaluation .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the limsup - mean evaluation of a stochastic game can be reduced to the study of the limsup evaluation of an auxiliary stochastic game having as set of states the set of finite histories of the original game .",
