    "frustration is one of the interesting subjects in statistical physics , mainly because it can induce additional symmetry and lead the system to display rich low - temperature structures .",
    "the so - called two - dimensional ( 2d ) fully frustrated xy models have attracted an extensive investigation in the last two decades @xcite . due to the frustration the systems possess additional discrete reflection symmetry @xmath7 , apart from the global spin rotation symmetry @xmath8 .",
    "the breakdown of these symmetries are the onset of two types of phase transitions , namely one corresponding to the magnetic transition of kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type @xcite and the other to the chiral transition . whether these transitions are decoupled or occur at the same temperature has long been a controversy @xcite .",
    "another debated issue is whether the universality class of the chiral ordering belongs to the ising universality class or not @xcite .",
    "the system has a corresponding physical realization on a planar arrays of coupled josephson junctions in a transverse magnetic field @xcite and discotic liquid crystals @xcite . as a 2d frustrated xy system ,",
    "two lattice systems are frequently studied numerically .",
    "the first one is the square lattice where the interactions can be a regular mixture of ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) couplings ( villain model ) @xcite .",
    "the second one is the af xy model on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "as for the 2d xy model , the effect of the @xmath9-fold symmetry - breaking fields is an interesting subject @xcite ; that is essentially the same as treating the @xmath9-state clock model , where only the discrete values are allowed for the angle of the xy spins .",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry of the xy model is replaced by the discrete @xmath10 symmetry in the @xmath9-state clock model .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the 2d @xmath9-state clock model has two phase transitions of kt type at @xmath11 and @xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath13 .",
    "there is an intermediate xy - like phase between a low - temperature ordered phase ( @xmath14 ) and a high - temperature disordered phase ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is quite interesting to investigate the effect of the @xmath9-fold symmetry - breaking fields in the case of the fully frustrated xy model .",
    "quite recently , noh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice using the metropolis monte carlo simulation because of the experimental relevance to cf@xmath16br monolayers physisorbed on graphite @xcite .",
    "however , they did not pay attention to the lower temperature phase transition of kt type .",
    "it is to be noticed that the existing controversy involves very fine values .",
    "most studies claiming single transition scenario still do not exclude the possibility of two very close critical temperatures .",
    "meanwhile , the studies in favor of double transition scenario always found that two critical phase transitions occur at slightly different temperatures .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to obtain precise numerical information . recently , much progress has been made in the development of efficient algorithms of monte carlo simulation .",
    "especially , several attempts have been proposed for the monte carlo algorithms to calculate the energy density of states ( dos ) directly .",
    "examples are the multicanonical method @xcite , the broad histogram method @xcite , the flat histogram method @xcite , and the wang and landau method @xcite .",
    "all of these algorithms use the random walk in the energy space .    in this paper",
    "we report our monte carlo study on the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice has the same structure as the af xy model ; therefore this model is regarded as a commensurate discrete model for the fully frustrated xy model . on the other hand , the six - state clock model on the square lattice ( villain model )",
    "has different gs configurations since there exist extra degeneracies .",
    "the presence of such extra degeneracy may bring about another interest in the fully frustrated six - state clock model .",
    "however , we will not cover such possibility in the present study .",
    "the xy villain and the eight - state clock villain models are commensurate because they have the same gs configuration .    for the monte carlo method",
    ", we employ the wang - landau algorithm @xcite , and the energy dos is refined by the use of the broad histogram relation @xcite .",
    "the fact that the energy of the six - state clock model is represented by the multiple of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coupling constant , is another supporting factor for the study of the six - state clock model ; it is convenient to treat discrete energy in the monte carlo simulation of calculating the dos directly .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows : in the next section we define the model and briefly explain the simulation method .",
    "details of the calculation and results will be presented in sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the xy spin model is written with the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the summation over nearest neighbor interactions , @xmath21 a unit planar spin vector occupying the @xmath22-th site , and @xmath23 the angle associated with the @xmath22-th spin . here",
    ", we mainly study the six - state clock model ; therefore the angle takes discrete values , @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the frustration is conveyed by @xmath26 . for the villain model on the square lattice",
    "this can be set by taking regular mixture of f and af couplings .",
    "for the triangular lattice on the other hand , @xmath26 are simply set to be uniform af couplings , @xmath27 , so that the system becomes fully frustrated .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is invariant under the symmetries of the global spin rotation @xmath8 and the global spin reflection @xmath7 .",
    "the breaking of these symmetries is expected to cause two kinds of ordering , which respectively correspond to magnetic ordering and chiral ordering .",
    "the gs configuration is well known as @xmath28-configuration , where two neighboring spins align in @xmath28 difference in angle , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ gsconf ] .",
    "we decompose the lattice into three interpenetrating sublattices for studying magnetic order .",
    "a site in a triangle belongs to one of the sublattices , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we assign the magnetic order parameter as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the magnetization of sublattice @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the number of spins ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 follow the same definitions for the sublattices @xmath37 and @xmath30 .    .",
    "spins are represented by arrows .",
    "sites belonging to the same sublattice have the same orientation of spins .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 signs indicate the handedness of the local chiralities .",
    "the ground state has 12-fold degeneracy . ]    to discuss the global spin reflection @xmath7 , we deal with the chirality .",
    "the local chirality on the elementary triangle is defined as @xmath40}_z    = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt 3 } \\sum_{j , k \\in { \\triangle}}\\sin(\\theta_k-\\theta_j),\\ ] ] where the @xmath41 component of the vector chirality is considered . the numerical factor in eq .",
    "( [ chiral ] ) is chosen such that the maximum of the absolute value is one . in the gs configuration",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "[ gsconf ] , the local chirality takes a checkerboard pattern of the right - handed ( positive ) orientation and the left - handed ( negative ) orientation .",
    "then , the staggered chirality @xmath42 becomes the order parameter for the @xmath7 symmetry breaking transition .",
    "the gs configuration has @xmath43-fold degeneracy which is induced by the discrete global spin rotation symmetry @xmath44 with @xmath45-fold and by @xmath7 symmetry with @xmath46-fold .",
    "the number of this degeneracy is used as one of the check conditions in the calculation of energy dos .",
    "we use the monte carlo method to calculate the energy dos directly to obtain precise numerical information .",
    "first , we briefly describe the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is similar to the multicanonical method ( entropic sampling ) of lee @xcite , the broad histogram method @xcite and the flat histogram method @xcite ; the idea is based on the observation that performing a random walk in energy space with a probability proportional to the reciprocal of the dos , @xmath47 , will result in a flat histogram of energy distribution .",
    "the wang - landau method introduces a modification factor to accelerate the diffusion of the random walk in the early stage of the simulation .",
    "since the dos is not known at the beginning , it is simply set @xmath48 for all energy @xmath49 . the transition probability from energy @xmath50 to @xmath51 reads @xmath52 , \\label{trans}\\ ] ] and the dos @xmath53 is iteratively updated as @xmath54 every time the state is visited .",
    "the modification factor @xmath55 is gradually reduced to unity by checking the ` flatness ' of the energy histogram ; the histogram for all possible @xmath49 is not less than some value of the average histogram , say , 0.80 .",
    "we also use the broad histogram relation for getting a refined dos . in proposing the broad histogram method , oliveira _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite paid attention to the number of potential moves , or the number of the possible energy change , @xmath56 , for a given state @xmath57 .",
    "the total number of moves is @xmath58 for a single spin flip process of the ising model simulation .",
    "the energy dos is related to the number of potential moves as @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the microcanonical average with fixed @xmath49 .",
    "this relation is shown to be valid on general grounds @xcite , and we call eq .",
    "( [ bhr ] ) the broad histogram relation .",
    "we measure the average of the potential move , @xmath61 , and use this information for getting a better estimate of the energy dos .",
    "it was stressed @xcite that @xmath56 is a macroscopic quantity , which is the advantage of using the number of potential moves .",
    "we should also note that the broad histogram relation does not depend on the particular dynamic rule one adopts , and the microcanonical averages of the potential moves can be obtained by any rule of monte carlo dynamics . in order to reduce calculation time for larger system sizes ,",
    "we break simulation into several energy windows and perform random walk in each different range of energy . the resultant pieces of the dos are joined together and used to produce the thermal average with the inverse temperature @xmath62 through the standard relation @xmath63 using the parallel machine , we perform the measurements of the physical quantity @xmath64 up to @xmath65 monte carlo steps .",
    "also , we perform 10 independent runs for each system size in order to get better statistics and to evaluate statistical errors .",
    "here we present the results for the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice .",
    "we have treated the system with the linear sizes @xmath66 = 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 .",
    "we apply the periodic boundary conditions .",

    "<S> monte carlo simulations using the newly proposed wang - landau algorithm together with the broad histogram relation are performed to study the antiferromagnetic six - state clock model on the triangular lattice , which is fully frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the existence of the magnetic ordering belonging to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type phase transition followed by the chiral ordering which occurs at slightly higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe the lower temperature phase transition of kt type due to the discrete symmetry of the clock model . by using finite - size scaling analysis , the higher kt temperature @xmath0 and the chiral critical temperature @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> are respectively estimated as @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in favor of the double transition scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the lower kt temperature is estimated as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> two decay exponents of kt transitions corresponding to higher and lower temperatures are respectively estimated as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which suggests that the exponents associated with the kt transitions are universal even for the frustrated model . </S>"
