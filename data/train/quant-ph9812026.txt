    "recent analysis of the spectra of the family of schrdinger operators with a complex pt invariant potential @xcite @xmath0 has raised considerable interest on such class of operators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the motivation for the requirement of parity times time reversal ( pt ) ( actually , complex conjugation ) symmetry comes from a conjecture of d. bessis relating it to the existence of real energy bound states ( in other words , non - decaying resonances ) . from a practical point of view",
    ", pt symmetry is a way of selecting a specific riemann sheet in the @xmath1 cut complex coordinate plane , the cut being necessary to cope with the @xmath2 branch point of the potential .    the loss of hermiticity of @xmath3 seems to imply complex energies for localized eigenstates , with @xmath4 ( i.e. , levels with nonzero widths ) , and consequently certain rate of decay of any initially localized state .",
    "the loss of hermiticity may be mediated , e.g. , by a spatial asymmetry of the potential .",
    "for example , it seems obvious that the cubic anharmonic hamiltonian @xmath5 allows particles to escape to infinity for any real coupling @xmath6 .",
    "a deeper perturbative and borel - summation analysis of this problem proved such an oversimplified thumb rule wrong many years ago .",
    "calicetti et al @xcite have shown that the spectrum of the cubic anharmonic oscillator ( [ aho ] ) becomes _ purely real _ and positive at any purely imaginary coupling @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the set of resonances of the hamiltonian ( [ aho ] ) as analogous to a set of bound states requires a suitable analytic continuation in @xmath9 and/or a careful deformation of the integration path @xcite .    the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian operator eq . ( [ xpown ] ) can not be integrated algebraically , and one has to resort to numerical methods for its analysis .",
    "cannata et al @xcite have found the way of generating complex hamiltonians related to real hamiltonians , by applying a method invented by darboux more than one hundred years ago .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting models have a very complicated structure .    in this paper",
    "we propose a family of problems characterized by two parameters , see eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) below , one of them ( @xmath10 ) playing a role analogous to the parameter @xmath10 of eq .",
    "( [ xpown ] ) and the other ( @xmath11 ) serving to _ tune _ the interaction thus widening the richness of the spectrum .",
    "our study of this family will be numerical or , in other words , phenomenological , hoping that it will help a further mathematical analysis .",
    "one of the main simplifications of our model is that the required complex integration paths are lines parallel to the real axis , easy to implement and to interpret .",
    "we consider the two - parameter family of one - dimensional potentials @xmath12 for arbitrary real values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these functions have in general a branch point at @xmath2 and we select such a branch that the real part of the potential is _ symmetric _ and the imaginary part _ antisymmetric _ with respect to the origin .",
    "specifically , the potential will be defined by the two equations @xmath13 thus having an invariant hamiltonian under the pt transformation , i.e. , parity transformation and complex conjugation .",
    "this requires to cut the complex @xmath14-plane from @xmath2 up to @xmath15 , and to consider the relevant negative @xmath14 values below the cut , i.e. with a small negative imaginary part or a phase @xmath16 .",
    ".variability of our pt symmetric potential with parameter @xmath10 , for @xmath17 and any real @xmath11 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for nonhermitean cases we change the coordinate according to @xmath18 so that the hamiltonian operator becomes @xmath19^ { \\alpha } \\cos(q)^ { \\beta}\\ ] ] and we can apply the rpm as in the case of a real schrdinger equation .",
    "if the potential energy is an even function of @xmath20 we apply the method just indicated ; if it is not then the rpm leads to two hankel determinants @xcite from which we obtain both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "table [ rpm2 ] shows results for @xmath23 and @xmath24 in excellent agreement with the numerical integration discussed above .",
    "we have carried out the rpm calculations algebraically by means of maple , resorting to a numerical approach just at the end in order to obtain the roots of the hankel determinants @xcite .",
    "for this reason the requirement of computer memory is considerable in the case of a nonsymmetric potential - energy function , and we can not handle determinants of the same dimension as in the symmetric case . for @xmath25",
    "we have tried to overcome this problem by means of the change of coordinate @xmath26 @xcite and applying rpm for symmetric potential - energy functions to the resulting hamiltonian operator @xmath27^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ] table [ rpm3 ] shows results for @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the former case",
    "the result is identical ( though more accurate ) to the one shown in table [ rpm2 ] ; however , in the latter case we do not obtain the lowest eigenvalue but the first excited one .",
    "we have not yet being able to justify this anomalous behavior of the rpm when @xmath24 .",
