    "usage of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems for enhancing achievable data rates in wireless systems by means of spatial diversity has been a topic of interest over the last decade @xcite .",
    "spatial diversity with multiple antennas may be difficult to implement in space and power - constrained mobile terminals , which has led to the recent development of cooperative diversity @xcite@xcite . in brief ,",
    "cooperative diversity is achieved when the data of a user is transmitted by its cooperating partners and vice - versa , which emulates a multi - antenna transmission scheme .",
    "this cooperation allows either an increase in achievable rates , a decrease in net power consumption , or an improved decoding performance due to diversity .",
    "conventional cooperation protocols are usually reciprocal , i.e. , when cooperation between two users is mutually beneficial in terms of increased throughput or energy efficiency . for this purpose ,",
    "amplify - and - forward ( af ) cooperation involves the partner forwarding a scaled version of its received signal to the final destination ; decode - and - forward ( df ) cooperation requires the partner to decode and then retransmit its estimate of the received information @xcite@xcite , and coded cooperation entails the alternate transmission of each other s incremental redundancy to a common destination @xcite@xcite .",
    "cooperative protocols are called full - duplex if partners transmit and receive information simultaneously over the same frequency , and half - duplex if partners are constrained to transmit and receive in channels that are orthogonal in time , frequency , or spreading code .",
    "while the af and df protocols offer different diversity and bit error benefits depending upon the quality of the inter - user channel , we adopt the full - duplex df technique as the underlying relaying scheme since we assume that the inter - user channel is statistically better than the direct channels .",
    "the selection of appropriate cooperative partners has been based largely on the optimization of physical layer parameters , primarily by a central controller .",
    "examples include using a maximum received snr criterion in @xcite , a centralized utility maximization method in @xcite , distributed selection using a fixed - priority list protocol in @xcite , maximum harmonic mean of source - relay and relay - destination channel gains in @xcite , and transmit power - minimizing partner / subcarrier assignment in @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of partner - selection research has been relay - oriented in nature , meaning the entire network is searched for optimal partners , and it is assumed that every user is involved in cooperative transmission over the network lifetime .",
    "another common assumption is that data sources have ready access to fixed relays in the network that do not have any information of their own to transmit .    in practice , even in small networks the rapidly changing inter - user channels , user asynchronicity , diverse quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements , user mobility , and users entering and leaving randomly",
    "make it difficult for users to gather enough information to even decide if cooperation is beneficial .",
    "more importantly , self - interested users may not always want to voluntarily engage in cooperation , particularly with weaker users in asymmetric fading conditions .",
    "therefore , in this paper we make the more realistic assumption that users seek relaying assistance only if they are unable to achieve a desired qos on their own .",
    "we then develop an auction - theoretic cooperative partner selection ( acops ) scheme by modeling users seeking cooperation as bidders and potential helpers as sellers .",
    "the use of auctions provides an incentive for stronger users to share their resources based on monetary incentives .",
    "previous applications of microeconomics to wireless networks include the use of pricing functions for regulation of power control , packet forwarding , and spectrum allocation in cognitive networks @xcite@xcite .",
    "the characteristics of competition and collaboration in cooperative networks naturally invite analyses based on game theory @xcite .",
    "auction - theoretic algorithms ( a subset of game theory ) have been proposed in @xcite for centralized downlink power allocation in code - division multiple - access systems , in @xcite for downlink bandwidth allocation in wireless fading channels , in @xcite for iterative power allocation by relays operating with a half - duplex af protocol , and @xcite for bandwidth allocation on an ofdma downlink .",
    "this paper focuses on the decentralized cooperative partner selection on the uplink of cellular or ad hoc networks using a second - price auction structure , as compared to the downlink resource allocation in the previous work mentioned above .",
    "the proposed auction approach is an example of so - called _ competitive _ fairness , since the users compete to decide the recipient of cooperative resources . in comparison",
    ", the application of pricing functions as in @xcite@xcite imposes a central utility function upon all users , which has been criticized as artificial fairness @xcite .",
    "the contributions of this paper are the following :    * we characterize best - reply strategies and seller revenue for the single - stage second - price sealed - bid auction in which the exact number of competitors is unknown for each bidder , and a single user is assisted over one network realization .",
    "we then prove the existence and uniqueness of the symmetric nash equilibria for the auction game under consideration .",
    "finally , we calculate the probability of outage and signaling overhead bounds in the context of single - partner cooperative communications over flat - fading channels . *",
    "we show that selling all objects together in a one - time multiple - object auction @xcite for multiple cooperative partner selection is preferable to holding sequential single - object auctions .",
    "we characterize revenue , probability of outage , and signaling overhead for a bundled multiple - object auction .",
    "this selection scheme is examined in the context of cooperative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) communications @xcite@xcite over frequency - selective fading channels . *",
    "finally , we develop a complete framework for the application of the novel results obtained above to a cooperative communication network . the performance of the proposed algorithms",
    "is then compared with existing partner selection , fully centralized partner allocation , and no cooperation schemes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the wireless network under consideration consists of single - antenna users self - grouped according to geographical proximity .",
    "user antennas are assumed to be omni - directional to facilitate cooperative communications .",
    "therefore , a group for a particular user may be approximated as a circle with radius limited by the range up to which signals can be transmitted and received with neighboring users , unlike @xcite where users must be able to receive signals from all other users .",
    "we focus on a cellular network with a single destination , and assume that the users may be grouped into two categories based upon their uplink channel condition .",
    "users that are unable to achieve a desired transmission rate due to poor channel quality to the destination or bs are termed _ weak users _ , and users possessing favorable channels to the bs are referred to as _ potential helpers _ or sellers in the remainder of this paper . in principle , the proposed scheme is applicable to a broad class of networks , for example , ad hoc wireless networks with differing source - destination pairs as compared to a fixed bs in cellular systems .",
    "the proposed acops model makes the following major assumptions :    1 .",
    "each user is assumed to have knowledge only of the inter - user link csi between itself and the potential helper within its group , and the csi of its direct link to the bs , 2 .",
    "weak users and helpers are both unaware of the exact number of neighboring weak users and their channel conditions , 3 .",
    "a single potential helper ( seller ) exists per group , 4 .",
    "only a single ( one - shot ) cooperation interval is analyzed ; and all cooperative communications are carried out over a single hop .",
    "assumptions ( _ _ a__1)-(__a__2 ) highlight the lack of complete information in the proposed partner - selection scheme , while ( _ _ a__3)-(__a__4 ) enable a simpler starting point for our investigation",
    ". extensions to ( _ _ a__3)-(__a__4 ) such as multiple potential helpers per group and cooperation over multiple stages are discussed in section  [ sec : extend ] .",
    "in particular , sec .  [",
    "sec : extend ] describes the considerable challenges that are introduced when examining a multi - stage version of the auction game in realistic wireless networks with dynamic user channels .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of all weak users in a single group .",
    "all direct - to - bs links and inter - user links between potential helpers and weak users within a group are modeled using a combination of small - scale fading , path loss , and shadowing @xcite . the small - scale fading is quasi - static rayleigh fading in nature .",
    "for the single - antenna user case , the channel capacity for a link with snr @xmath7 and a gaussian input is @xmath8 subject to an average transmit power constraint @xmath9 .",
    "the instantaneous snr of the link between users _",
    "i _ and _ j _ at a distance @xmath10 can be represented as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the normalized complex gaussian fading coefficient with amplitude @xmath13 , @xmath14 being normally distributed , and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the average snr of the link , with transmit power @xmath9 , bandwidth _ w _ , transmit and receive antenna gains @xmath17 , log - normally distributed shadowing component @xmath18 , and path - loss exponent @xmath19 , @xmath20 typically .",
    "complex additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath21 per dimension is present at all receiving terminals .",
    "the direct - to - bs links of the weak users are assumed to be dominated by the large - scale fading effects of shadowing and path loss , over an extended period of time .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the achievable direct - link transmission rate without cooperation for the @xmath23 weak user .",
    "assume the desired transmission rate to be @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which indicates a shortfall of @xmath26 .",
    "i _ then seeks to approach the target rate @xmath24 by attempting to cooperate with a potential helper in its vicinity , if any .",
    "under rayleigh fading , @xmath27 is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if we define the outage probability for a target rate @xmath24 as the probability of @xmath24 exceeding the achievable link capacity @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , then from ( [ eq : capacity ] ) we can write the non - cooperative outage probability as @xmath31 the achievable total rate @xmath32 for the @xmath23 weak user cooperating with a single potential helper is @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the cooperative rate provided by the potential helper to the @xmath23 weak user . for simulation purposes we assume an idealized full - duplex decode - and - forward protocol with perfect echo cancelation and synchronization , as well as zero processing delay",
    ". if half - duplex cooperation is considered , a suitable factor of @xmath35 can be introduced in ( [ eq : cooprate ] ) to account for the rate penalty incurred .",
    "the specific cooperative rate expressions for af and df protocols with a half - duplex relaying constraint have been derived in @xcite , and can be integrated into acops if so desired .    a weak user _",
    "i _ that desires a higher uplink data rate broadcasts its cooperative rate request @xmath36 , which is overheard by neighboring users .",
    "potential helpers who receive such request(s ) respond with the data rate @xmath37 they are willing to allocate for cooperative communication , @xmath38 .",
    "the helper - user links are considered to be reciprocal ; this response allows the weak users to estimate the quality of their link to the helper , fulfilling assumption ( _ _ a__1 ) .      for a cooperative ofdm scenario ,",
    "the wireless link between users is modeled as a frequency - selective block - fading channel with @xmath39 delay paths or taps and an exponentially decaying intensity profile .",
    "if the total bandwidth is divided into @xmath40 subchannels with uniform power allocation to decrease csi requirements , the total capacity is the sum of the rates of the parallel subchannels as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the exponentially distributed snr on subchannel _ k _ between users @xmath43 and @xmath44 and implicitly depends on @xmath39 .",
    "our cooperative ofdm model considers a single potential helper with @xmath40 subchannels offered for cooperation to _",
    "n _ weak users , @xmath45 since subchannels are not allowed to be shared between users over one cooperative epoch .     weak users . ]",
    "an example of an asymmetric single - carrier cooperative network is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where a single potential helper and _ n _ = 5 weak users are assumed to constitute a group .",
    "all five weak users are assumed to be in outage and therefore broadcast cooperative rate requests @xmath46 .",
    "four of the five weak users , numbered as _ i _",
    "= 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , possess a much more favorable link to the potential helper compared to their direct links to the bs , and therefore receive a response from the potential helper which has a strong link to the bs , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "the feedback from the potential helper enables the weak users to estimate the quality of their user - to - helper link @xmath48 .",
    "the fifth weak user ( _ i _ = 5 ) , in fig . 1 has unfavorable channels to both the bs and the potential helper .",
    "therefore it may not receive a response from the potential helper at all , or based upon the response , it perceives the poor quality of its user - to - helper link and abstains from cooperation .",
    "auctions can be modeled as games of incomplete information @xcite,@xcite . a game @xmath49 consists of ( i ) a set of @xmath50 players , ( ii ) for each player @xmath51 , a nonempty set of actions @xmath52 and a payoff function @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , an auction game with player set @xmath54 can be compactly represented in strategic form as @xmath55_{i \\in { \\mathcal{n}}}$ ] .    in a sealed - bid auction ,",
    "bids are submitted confidentially and are known only to the seller .",
    "a first - price sealed - bid auction awards the object to the highest bidder who pays his bid , whereas a second - price auction awards the object to the highest bidder who pays an amount equal to the second - highest of all bids placed . in both formats ,",
    "losing bidders do not pay anything .",
    "it is shown in subsequent sections that the proposed auction game strikes a balance between revenue maximization at the seller level , and efficient allocation at the network level .",
    "all auction - theoretic mechanisms in this paper conform to standard auctions in the following ways : ( 1 ) the object(s ) on sale is always awarded to the highest bidder , ( 2 ) all bidders are treated as anonymous entities , and ( 3 ) ties are broken by random allotment of the object to one of the high bidders .",
    "our assumptions for acops , such as user asynchronicity , uncertainty about the number of bidders and private values signify that we analyze auctions as games of incomplete information .",
    "the relevance of objects , payoffs , bids , and winners for the cooperative wireless network under consideration is explained later in this section . even though bids are broadcast and can be overheard by competing bidders , the assumption of private values still holds since",
    "bids already placed can not be updated within one contention interval , and it is shown in the next section that the optimum bidding strategy is independent of other bids . in other words ,",
    "bids that have not yet been placed are not influenced by overheard bids , and hence the auction is equivalent to a sealed - bid format .    at user initiation ,",
    "each user is provided with an equal amount of virtual ` money ' or tokens for the purpose of resource contention.the proposed wireless network model has a group of weak users willing to pay varying amounts of ` money ' for higher degrees of quality of service ( qos ) , and a group of potential helpers willing to receive monetary compensation for sharing their resources and assisting such users as envisioned in @xcite .",
    "revenue accumulated by helpers can be used in turn for their own cooperative bids during adverse link conditions in the future , since as stated before , potential helpers are not fixed over time .",
    "it is in the best interest of every potential helper to maximize its expected revenue .",
    "therefore , the proposed mechanism serves as an incentive for advantaged users to participate in cooperation over the network .",
    "weak users and @xmath56 bidders involved in the contention stage .",
    "cooperation requests @xmath36 and bids @xmath57 are received at different times by the helper due to asynchronous users .",
    "the duration of cooperation denoted by @xmath58 is limited by the channel coherence time of the potential helper ; since the helper itself is mobile it may not always be in a more advantageous position with respect to the bs .",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are assumed to be fractions of @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",

    "the auction contention occurs if and only if ( a ) the number of cooperation requests received by the potential helper is greater than or equal to two , and ( b ) if @xmath62 , i.e. , the helper s own qos is already satisfied .",

    "@xmath60 is over and cooperative transmissions have commenced , the helper ignores any cooperative requests received during time @xmath58 .",

    "the preceding sections have thus far considered one - hop relaying in single stage auctions where the winning bidders are assumed to have sufficient funds to pay the required price .",
    "the extension of acops to multi - hop relaying can be achieved using auctions with a resale market , where buyers of goods are free to resell them in a subsequent auction within the same cooperation interval .",
    "next , we consider the more involved scenarios of multiple - stage ( sequential ) acops , and auctions with more than one potential helper .",
    "the analysis of repeated auctions over successive time periods necessitates introduction of sequential auction games with budget constraints .",
    "first and second - price single - stage auctions with budget constraints are well studied in the literature @xcite , however the revenue equivalence principle no longer holds .",
    "sequential single - object auctions with budget constraints is an evolving field of auction theory .",
    "equilibrium strategies have been derived for certain specialized cases such as finite - horizon sequential auctions with an identical good sold in every stage by a fixed seller to budget - constrained bidders without rival uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , most previous studies assume that bidders have utility for only a single unit , i.e. , they drop out after winning a particular stage .",
    "the conventional modeling of budget constraints also merits mention : budget constraints are either assumed to be a pre - specified constant , or a random variable with a realization revealed to the bidder at every stage @xcite .    in the context of partner selection in dynamic wireless networks ,",
    "our general auction scenario differs in virtually every aspect : non - identical sale objects in successive stages due to changing channel conditions , private values and budgets , infinite time horizon , dynamic entry / exit of users , and absence of a fixed seller .",
    "it is tempting to consider simplifying assumptions in acops in order to make the problem more tractable .",
    "for example , assuming budgets are publicly known as in @xcite makes it easier for bidders to plan future strategies based on the current bids of competitors .",
    "however , the fundamentally unique aspect of our acops game is the fact that users can act as either a bidder or a seller in a given stage , and their budget evolves over time corresponding to their actions and the outcomes of past stages . to our best knowledge",
    ", such a sequential auction scenario has yet to be studied by the auction theory community .",
    "let us assume that in the sequential version of acops , each user attempts to minimize the number of stages in which it suffers from outage over the duration of its presence in the network .",
    "the channel conditions and therefore private values of each user are revealed to them in a causal manner at the beginning of every stage .",
    "however , the residual budget from the conclusion of a stage carries over to the next one .",
    "therefore , at stage @xmath63 , user @xmath43 possesses private information @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the available budget .",
    "we first establish that it is always beneficial for a strong user to act as a potential helper .",
    "consider two strong users @xmath66 and @xmath67 that enter the game at stage @xmath63 with an identical initial budget constraint and face @xmath68 weak users .",
    "@xmath66 is willing to act as a potential helper at stage @xmath63 , whereas @xmath67 abstains from cooperating with weak users .",
    "since both users are ` strong ' , they possess spare resources by definition , therefore being a helper does not affect @xmath66 s qos at the very least .",
    "let us assume that from stage @xmath69 onwards , @xmath66 and @xmath67 find themselves in the category of weak users and both begin to bid for cooperation .",
    "now , serving as a helper in stage @xmath63 enables @xmath66 to participate in @xmath70 _ additional _ forthcoming stages after the point at which @xmath67 exhausts its budget , where @xmath70 can be computed as the ratio of @xmath66 s expected revenue in stage @xmath63 to @xmath66 s expected payments in stages @xmath71 using theorem 2 .",
    "we assume that a reasonable strategy for a user in sequential acops is as follows : if ` strong ' , then act as a helper ; if ` weak ' , then bid the minimum of his private value and budget in each stage , which is optimal for the single - stage auction game .",
    "a rigorous proof of the optimality of this strategy is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "alternatively , the bidders may adopt a linear bidding function of the form @xmath72 as proposed in @xcite , where the constant @xmath73 is chosen to satisfy the budget constraint @xmath65 at that stage ( i.e. , the entire budget is placed as a bid regardless of the private value ) .",
    "intuitively , an aggressive bidding strategy of this kind maximizes the probability of winning a particular stage but risks a negative payoff in that stage , and also leads to a faster depletion of the budget .",
    "we compare these two strategies by means of simulation in the next section .",
    "a multi - stage multiple - object auction game with budget constraints is again an open problem in auction theory research , as is the existence and closed - form expressions for equilibria in multiple - object auctions with non - identical goods .",
    "the situation where one weak user can choose between two or more potential helpers in a stage can be studied by using simultaneous auction models @xcite . in the absence of budget constraints",
    ", it is known that the optimal strategy for a bidder is to place bids with all available sellers . for the general multi - stage scenario with budget constraints",
    ", the game evolves into a dynamic market game with competition between the multiple sellers at one level , and competition among the bidders as before .",
    "such games have been investigated in the context of dynamic spectrum allocation in wireless networks @xcite , for example .",
    "the following representative examples are used for simulation purposes .",
    "users are assumed to be quasi - static with a mobile velocity of 3 km / hr to capture the effect of prolonged shadowing .",
    "we refer to max snr partner selection as partner selection based upon highest instantaneous helper - user snr @xmath48 .",
    "the cooperative ofdm system is set to @xmath74 subcarriers .",
    "for all centralized schemes considered , the bs has complete csi to and between all users , and assigns partners either on a max - min criterion that tries to maximize the lowest user throughput , or an opportunistic throughput - maximizing criterion @xcite .",

    "it is observed that the acops mechanism performs close to the opportunistic max - snr selection in the worst direct - to - bs snr regime due to the choice of the private value expression for @xmath80 , while the two curves converge in the high snr regime .",

    "[ fig : feedback ] shows the signaling overhead in bits under single - object and multiple - object ( naive and bundle formats ) acops , and a bs under centralized single and multiple partner selection versus number of weak users @xmath68 .",
    "for the bundle multiple - object auction , the number of bundles @xmath83 is equated to the number of bidding weak users @xmath68 for simplicity .",

    "the channel realizations are independent across users and stages , while budgets carry over .",
    "the required data rate is set such that users are in outage roughly 70% of the time without any cooperation .",
    "we observe that the users that do not assist others exhaust their budget very quickly and thereafter are unable to participate in auctions when weak .",

    "the auction - theoretic partner - selection strategy was also shown to significantly reduce the signaling overhead involved in configuring cooperative communications , which will translate into improved bandwidth and power efficiency for mobile users .",
