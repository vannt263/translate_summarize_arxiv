    "the phenomenon of superconductivity remains one of the most interesting problems of condensed matter physics .",
    "in particular , in recent years the material science development has revealed several interesting systems where high transition temperature superconductivity was found , in particular the families of high-@xmath6 cuprates @xcite with a maximum @xmath6 of about 155 k. soon after their discovery it was realized that the essential physics of cuprates takes place in the cuo@xmath0-planes which is believed to be responsible for the high transition temperature .",

    "first , the crystal structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is identical to that of the parent compound of the high-@xmath6 superconductor la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for illustration ) .",
    "both kinds of materials are highly two - dimensional and as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the structure is almost identical to that of the la@xmath9sr@xmath7cuo@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "both materials are oxides with conduction occurring in partially filled @xmath10bands that are strongly hybridized with the oxygen @xmath5-orbitals .",
    "therefore , it was generally believed that a comparison of the normal and superconducting properties of the cuprates and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 will give a deeper understanding of the nature of the high-@xmath6 in the cuprates .",
    "however , it has been found that the differences between sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and the cuprates are larger than their general similarities might suggest",
    ". in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 superconductivity occurs only at low temperatures and the normal state is a well - defined fermi - liquid .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the anomalous normal state of the cuprates .",
    "furthermore , it was soon found that the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is very interesting on its own .",
    "in particular , there are clear indications that the superconducting state is unconventional . for example",
    ", the transition temperature is highly sensitive to impurities @xcite and nuclear quadrupole resonance(nqr ) experiments do not show a hebel - slichter peak in the spin - lattice relaxation at @xmath6 @xcite . shortly after the discovery of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "it was suggested that superconductivity might arise from odd - parity ( spin - triplet ) cooper - pairs with total spin @xmath11 and a non - zero angular momentum which is reminiscent of the phases of superfluid @xmath12he @xcite . the basis for this suggestion was the presence of ferromagnetism in the related compounds as srruo@xmath13 and thus the expectation of ferromagnetic fluctuations in metallic sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "to support this picture the model phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phasesr ] has been suggested .",
    "ru@xmath14o@xmath15 , taken from ref .",
    "the number of layers is the parameter which determines the transition between the two phases : mo = magnetically ordered and sc = superconducting .",
    "this phase digram suggests ferromagnetic excitations in the normal state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    here , one plots the phase of the ferromagnetic and superconducting members of the so - called rodllesen - popper series ( sr@xmath16ru@xmath14o@xmath15 ) as a function of the numbers of ruo@xmath0-layers per unit cell , @xmath17 .",
    "the infinite layer ( srruo@xmath13 ) is a ferromagnet with @xmath18 k. for @xmath17=3 one finds @xmath19 k and for @xmath17=2 the substance orders magnetically at @xmath20 k. this demonstrates the tendency that @xmath21 is reduced with decreasing layer number @xmath17 and suggests that even for @xmath17=1 , when supeconductivity occurs , one expects significant ferromagnetic fluctuations which may play an important role for triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile , a number of experiments indeed point towards spin - triplet cooper - pairing .",
    "the most convincing evidence comes from the @xmath22o nmr knight shift data which shows that the spin susceptibility is not affected by the superconducting state for a magnetic field parallel to the ruo@xmath0-plane @xcite . in fig .",

    "one clearly sees that in contrast to the singlet cooper - pairing ( illustrated by the dashed curve ) where spin susceptibility decreases upon cooling , the knight shift in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is unchanged by lowering @xmath23 below @xmath6 .",
    "the knight shift doe not decrease below @xmath6 , since the polarization induced by the external magnetic field does not change in the superconducting state in case of spin - triplet cooper - pairs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    decreases rapidly below @xmath6 due to the formation of singlet cooper - pairs . on the other hand , in a triplet superconductor with s=1",
    "the spin part of the knight shift should not change below @xmath6 for some field orientations , since the polarization induced by the weak external magnetic field and probed by nmr does not change .",
    "this behavior was observed in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by ishida _",
    "_ @xcite and provides strong evidence for triplet cooper - pairing .    however , recently it has became clear that the situation is not that simple .",
    "for example , the intensive studies by means of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) reveal the presence of strong two - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at * q*@xmath24 and no sign of ferromagnetic fluctuations in the normal state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this fact , at first glance , can not be compatible with triplet cooper - pairing and thus the role of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the formation of superconductivity has to be clarified .",
    "moreover , further analysis of the nmr data indicated the magnetic response to be strongly anisotropic @xcite . in particular , the measured longitudinal component of the spin susceptibility @xmath25 is much larger than the transverse one @xmath26 , while from an isotropic model one expects @xmath27 .",
    "this anisotropy increases with decreasing temperature and reaches a maximum close to @xmath6 indicating its influence on the superconducting properties .",
    "therefore , in view of the importance of spin fluctuations for the unconventional superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 their behavior should be understood in more detail .",
    "another interesting question concerns the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "while the analogy to the case of superfluid @xmath12he leads to the suggestion of nodeless @xmath5-wave superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , recent analysis of the specific heat data @xcite indicates a more complicated and anisotropic behavior of the superconducting order parameter in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "therefore , the physics of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is far from being completely understood .",
    "note , an extensive review on the experimental situation can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that review , in the present review we mainly analyze the role played by strong electronic correlations and spin fluctuations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "so far their role in determining the superconducting and normal state properties has not been addressed in detail .",
    "probably , this was due to the success of the conventional band theory in explaining the various properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "however , its success is mainly due to the correct description of the fermi surface topology in this compound . the fermi surface shape , however , is hardly affected by the electronic correlations , while on the other hand the bandwidth and the energy dispersion are strongly modified .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case for the ruthenates .",
    "furthermore , we review the spin - fluctuation mediated cooper - pairing scenario in application to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and address the important role of spin - orbit coupling in this system . in particular , we discuss the symmetry of the relevant superconducting order parameter within this scenario and , finally , investigate the role of impurities in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the formal valence of the ruthenium ion is ru@xmath28 .",
    "this leaves four electrons remaining in the @xmath29-shell .",
    "furthermore , the ru ion sits at the center of a ruo@xmath30-octahedron and the crystal field of the o@xmath31 ions splits the five @xmath29-states into threefold ( @xmath32 ) and twofold ( @xmath33 ) subshells as illustrated in fig .",

    "thus , the @xmath37-orbital will form a two - dimensional band , while the @xmath35- and @xmath36-bands have only a restricted one - dimensional character . then , to describe the lda results the following tight - binding energy dispersions can be introduced @xmath54 the lattice constants @xmath55 have been set to unity .",

    "k small deviations from this law occur . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath65 becomes linear with a temperature dependence similar to the cuprates .",

    "its role in the formation of triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 requires special consideration .",
    "long - range magnetic order is absent in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . on the other hand",
    "the uniform magnetic susceptibility is much larger than the pauli susceptibility of the non - interacting electrons . indeed",
    "the ab - initio calculations of the stoner factor @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the exchange parameter at @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the density of states at the fermi level ) gives the following values @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75 @xcite . using a simple so - called stoner criterium , this indicates that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is in the vicinity of the instability to ferromagnetism . in srruo@xmath13",
    "the corresponding stoner parameter is @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "the response of the @xmath37-band is enhanced due to the presence of the van - hove singularity close to the fermi level .",
    "then , it becomes clear that the features observed by ins relate mainly to the magnetic response of the @xmath35- and @xmath36-bands .",
    "furthermore , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the stoner enhancement related to the appearance of the incommensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations is even stronger than the ferromagnetic one and is of the order of 1 .",
    "this means that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is almost unstable with respect to the spin density wave formation ( sdw ) .",
    "note , that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations are seen experimentally in the normal state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by means of @xmath22o knight shift @xcite and by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that an effective hamiltonian for describing the physics in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a two - dimensional three - band hubbard hamiltonian @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fourier transform of the annihilation operator for the @xmath89 orbital electrons ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 is an effective on - site coulomb repulsion",
    ". the hopping integrals @xmath92 denote the energy dispersions of the tight - binding bands , see eq.([lind ] ) .    as a result the spin dynamics in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is determined by the competition and the delicate balance between ferromagnetic and incommensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the natural question arises what is the influence of these magnetic fluctuations on the triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ? in the following subsection we will study the formation of triplet of superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 driven by the spin fluctuation exchange .    in the remainder of this section we discuss another aspect of the ruthenates , namely strong electronic correlations . as a matter of fact the success of ab - initio methods in describing magnetism of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 appear to invalidate , at first sight , the discussion of the role of strong electronic correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of strong electronic correlations are small if the bandwidth of the conduction band @xmath93 is much larger than the on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath94 . given that the bandwidth is of the order of 1 ev there is no reason to think that @xmath95 in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . to estimate the value of @xmath94 one has to remember that for 4@xmath2-electrons @xmath94 has to be smaller than for @xmath96-electrons , since the average radius of the 4@xmath2-shell is approximately two times larger than for the 3@xmath2-shell .",
    "then a simple estimates gives u@xmath97 ev .",
    "this means that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is in the regime of intermediate electronic correlations when @xmath98 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , despite of the importance of the electronic correlations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the relative success of the band structure theory can be easily explained .",
    "the correct description of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations comes from the correct fermi surface topology which is not affected by the electronic correlations .",
    "however , the bandwidth and the energy dispersion are strongly affected by the electronic correlations in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . for example , it has been shown by liebsch and lichtenstein @xcite that in order to explain the bandwidth as measured by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) the electronic correlations have to be taken into account .",
    "in particular , using dynamical - mean - field theory ( dmft ) they have shown that , while the fermi surface topology is the same independent on electronic correlations , the bandwidth is different , namely the correlations reduce the bandwidth of the all bands in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "we will further address this issue discussion the phase diagram of ca@xmath9sr@xmath7ruo@xmath1 .",
    "even before experimental results have indicated triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , its possibility had been theoretically predicted by sigrist and rice @xcite . in particular , they considered the triplet superconductivity on a square lattice as an electronic analogy of the superfluid a - phase in @xmath12he .    for the spin - triplet cooper - pairing the wave function can be written as a matrix in spin space @xmath99 where the eigenvalues of the s@xmath100 operator with projection + 1 , 0 , -1 have the form @xmath101 another possibility to express the cooper - pair wave function is to use the basis of the symmetric matrices @xmath102 then the cooper - pair wave function has the form @xmath103 the components of the vector * d * can be expressed linearly via the amplitudes of @xmath104 : @xmath105 due to the pauli principle the orbital part of the wave function with total @xmath11 has to be odd , i.e. the orbital quantum number @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , one can speak about @xmath107 cooper - pairing in a continuum system . in particular ,",
    "the amplitudes g@xmath108 and the vector * d(k ) * have to be the odd functions of the momentum * k*.    in the tetragonal crystal structure such as that of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the order parameter * d(k ) * has to belong to the corresponding irreducible representation of the d@xmath109 group .",
    "there are several representations @xcite and the proper choice can be made by comparison to experiment .",
    "for example , the spin state of the cooper - pair wave function can be obtained from the measuring the knight shift in nmr and polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments below @xmath6 .",
    "the orbital state can be measured by muon spin relaxation ( @xmath110sr ) indicating time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "the square symmetry of the vortex lattice can also be interpreted as evidence for @xmath5-wave pairing .    as we have shown in the introduction ,",
    "the nmr knight shift experiments indicate spin - triplet cooper - pairing in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion has been drawn from the polarized neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry breaking detected by means of the @xmath110sr @xcite suggests the superconducting order parameter @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( so - called chiral @xmath5-wave state ) : @xmath114 the amplitude of this gap is isotropic , @xmath115 , and does not have a node at the fermi surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "so far , the above analysis is quite general .",
    "next , we assume the superconductivity is driven by the exchange of spin fluctuations .",
    "the interesting question in the ruthenates is why does triplet cooper - pairing take place in the presence of strong incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at @xmath82 originating from the @xmath35- and @xmath36-bands and only relatively weak ferromagnetic fluctuations arising from the @xmath37-band . in general , to answer this question the bcs gap equation ( see eq .",

    "the reason for this ( as we show later ) is the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we discuss its role in detail in the next section .",

    "the magnetism in the ruthenates resulting from the quasiparticles in the @xmath32-orbital is itinerant and thus the magnetic response is created by the same electrons that form also the cooper - pairs .",
    "then , for example , the irreducible part of the charge susceptibility @xmath130 is defined in terms of the electronic green s functions @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the single - electron green s function ( we omit here the band indices for simplicity ) .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse components of the spin susceptibilities are also calculated in terms of the electronic green s functions .",
    "in contrast to the cuprates , in the ruthenates @xmath136 and @xmath137 are different due to the magnetic anisotropy @xcite .    in the ruthenates",

    "<S> we review the normal and superconducting state properties of the unconventional triplet superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with an emphasis on the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and the role played by strong electronic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the magnetic activity arises from the itinerant electrons in the ru @xmath2-orbitals and a strong magnetic anisotropy occurs ( @xmath3 ) due to spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the latter results mainly from different values of the @xmath4-factor for the transverse and longitudinal components of the spin susceptibility ( i.e. the matrix elements differ ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , this anisotropy and the presence of incommensurate antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fluctuations have strong consequences for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> reviewing spin fluctuation - induced cooper - pairing scenario in application to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 we show how @xmath5-wave cooper - pairing with line nodes between neighboring ruo@xmath0-planes may occur .    </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the open issues in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 like the influence of magnetic and non - magnetic impurities on the superconducting and normal state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the physics of triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is still far from being understood completely and remains to be analyzed more in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to apply the theory also to superconductivity in heavy - fermion systems exhibiting spin fluctuations . </S>"
