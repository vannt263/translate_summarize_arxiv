    "the dynamical evolution of spatially inhomogeneous semiclassical field configurations along with quantum fluctuations that dress them play an important role in many relevant problems in high energy and condensed matter physics .",
    "such situations are ubiquitous in the description of semiclassical processes such as baryogenesis via sphaleron decay@xcite , bubble and droplet nucleation during supercooled phase transitions as it could be the case in qcd@xcite , the formation of topological defects@xcite and the possibility of formation of disoriented chiral condensates@xcite .",
    "localized high energy and large amplitude field configurations are of particular relevance for modelling the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions as was proposed for example by@xcite in terms of collisions of yang - mills wave - packets . in this case",
    "an approximation to the dynamics of high initial multiplicity states would be to provide an initial value problem with a particular initial condition on the field at some proper time surface . by proposing a large amplitude field configuration localized in space in the form of a semiclassical coherent state , the features associated with an initial state of large energy density and high multiplicity are captured .",
    "for example such field could be a strong color field or electric field whose relaxation will result in high multiplicity particle production@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of coherent structures and semiclassical field configurations is also of theoretical and experimental relevance in condensed matter physics within the context of transport phenomena mediated by soliton excitations in quasi - one dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "although there have been several studies of real - time dynamics of classical field configurations within the context of sphaleron decay@xcite , non - abelian wave - packet collisions@xcite and coherent structures in scalar field theories@xcite including classical@xcite and semiclassical@xcite studies of disoriented chiral condensates , there have been very few and limited attempts to incorporate consistently the effects of quantum fluctuations upon the dynamics of semiclassical inhomogeneous configurations and mainly in one spatial dimension@xcite . whereas the dynamics of inhomogeneous field configurations had been studied in the small amplitude regime@xcite , the important regime of large amplitude and non - perturbative field configurations is still not understood .",
    "recently there has been tremendous progress in studying the non - equilibrium dynamics of high energy and high multiplicity quantum states including self - consistently quantum fluctuations in the case of spatial or spatial rapidity homogeneity to study particle production in strong fields , dynamics of phase transitions and relaxation and the dynamics of inflation@xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular these methods had been used to study the formation of disoriented chiral condensates , and pion production and relaxation during the chiral phase transition in low - energy phenomenological models@xcite and more recently initial quantum states of large multiplicity distributions with localized momenta@xcite .",
    "these studies rely on an implementation of variational and large @xmath2@xcite-@xcite approximations generalized to strongly out of equilibrium situations .",
    "these approximations @xcite-@xcite are specially suited for studying non - perturbative phenomena and in particular the large@xmath2approximation is amenable to consistent improvement@xcite .",
    "since these methods allow one to study the full quantum evolution in a non - perturbative manner they are specially tailored to studying the non - equilibrium evolution of initial inhomogeneous quantum states of large energy including quantum back - reaction effects .",
    "this is specially important in the modelling of relativistic heavy ion collisions in a manner that allows one to include the effects of quantum backreaction and non - perturbative particle production .",
    "a useful description of the dynamical evolution in relativistic heavy ion collisions is based on a hydrodynamic picture in terms of a fluid that is described in local thermodynamic equilibrium by a local energy momentum tensor and an equation of state@xcite .",
    "although such a description is not only physically compelling but also experimentally consistent at the present energies@xcite , it is at best phenomenological and not justified from a microscopic theory .",
    "the hydrodynamic description relies on the assumption that as a result of the collision a large amount of energy is deposited in a small region of space - time .",
    "boost invariant hydrodynamics@xcite should emerge when the energy density is much larger than the typical hadronic masses , and is a result of hydrodynamic scaling when the resulting pancake width goes to zero with center of mass energy . in this scaling limit",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom for describing the expansion are the fluid proper time and fluid rapidity .",
    "although trying to study the emergence of boost invariant hydrodynamics within the framework of qcd is at this stage an impossible task , the features of hydrodynamical evolution and particle production are rather robust and should be captured by a microscopic albeit semi - phenomenological theory .    in this article",
    "we begin our study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of inhomogeneous field configurations of large amplitude including the back - reaction of quantum fluctuations self - consistently and non - perturbatively .",
    "the focus and goal of this program is to study the relaxation of a strongly out of equilibrium inhomogeneous initial state , the description of particle production and the emergence of a hydrodynamical description from an _ ab initio _ full quantum evolution in a microscopic , phenomenologically inspired quantum field theory .",
    "this article is devoted to setting up the variational self - consistent problem and to studying the subtle but important issues of renormalization .",
    "the implementation of variational or large @xmath2 approximations to study the dynamics requires : i ) to determine the cauchy data for the inhomogeneous expectation value of the field as well as the relevant green s functions that account for backreaction .",
    "since both the variational and the large @xmath2 approximations lead to a self - consistent condition , the cauchy data must be determined self - consistently .",
    "the solution to this self - consistent initial value problem for inhomogeneous field configurations is typically an extremely difficult and numerically intensive task .",
    "ii ) setting up a closed set of _ local _ renormalized update equations that can be numerically implemented in current computers .",
    "both the locality as well as renormalizability aspects are extremely important : current computational capabilities can not handle non - local update equations because they are memory intensive .",
    "the numerical evolution will be implemented on a space - time mesh and the results should be insensitive to the mesh size , this requires renormalized evolution equations , which is also important to improve numerical stability .",
    "this issue is clearly very important for the quantum backreaction because the green s functions that are necessary have short distance singularities that must be renormalized .",
    "\\iii ) finally the numerical implementation of the update equations obtained in ii ) starting from the initial data provided by the first step .",
    "in this work we seek to provide the first two steps to implement this program , leaving the numerical implementation to a forthcoming article .",
    "the coupled evolution equations that we find more suitable for a numerical approach in the self - consistent hartree and large n approximations are summarized below in eqns .",
    "( [ classi]-[kdot2 ] ) .",
    "we focus on studying the initial value problem and the update equations first in relevant cases in @xmath3 dimensions not only because it is a simpler setting but also because it is a relevant problem not only in quantum field theory but also in condensed matter physics in the case of quasi - one dimensional systems . by treating these examples in one spatial dimension",
    "we determine a strategy to set up the self - consistent initial value problem that can be implemented for particular three dimensional geometries relevant to the description of ` colliding pancakes ' in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this strategy is based on mapping the initial value problem ( in terms of the variational parameters ) onto a schrdinger - like problem whose spectrum of eigenvectors and eigenvalues is exactly known .",
    "we then move on to the linear sigma model description of pion physics and implement a large @xmath2 self - consistent approximation and the strategy developed in the one dimensional case to set up the cauchy data . in this case",
    "we find some novel phenomena associated with spinodal instabilities for large amplitude field configurations .",
    "finally we address the issue of renormalization and obtain the ( semi ) local update equations .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the different formulations to implement the variational and hartree approximations , discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods and determine the method that we find the most suitable for numerical implementation at this stage .",
    "section iii is devoted to a description of the initial value problem .",
    "section iv presents a detailed analysis of the self - consistent initial value problem for the cases of the sine - gordon and @xmath0 theories in @xmath3 space - time dimensions . after analyzing the vacuum structure in the variational approximation",
    "we propose simple self - consistent ansatzse for the cauchy data for both topological ( kink ) and pulse - like ( lumps ) field configurations by establishing a correspondence between the initial value problem in terms of the variational parameters and the eigenvalue problem of a schrdinger operator whose spectrum is exactly known .",
    "the renormalization aspects are studied in detail .",
    "these examples are relevant for studying the dynamics of solitons dressed by the quantum fluctuations in @xmath3 dimensions and to study the relaxation of large amplitude field configurations via meson production .    in section",
    "v we study the linear sigma model description of low energy pion phenomenology by implementing a large @xmath2 approximation in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "we find that the leading order in the large n is similar to a hartree factorization which allows us to use the formulation presented in section ii .",
    "we use the results of the @xmath3 dimensional case to set up self - consistent cauchy data for an initial inhomogeneous configuration with cylindrical symmetry that could model the initial state after the collision of lorentz contracted ` pancakes ' .",
    "the subtle renormalization aspects are discussed in detail and we find a phenomenon akin to the klein paradox that results in spinodal instabilities for large amplitude inhomogeneous configurations .    in section vi",
    "the dynamical evolution equations are summarized in terms of fully renormalized quantities and the initial data on all of the green s functions that are needed for the update is determined .",
    "section vii proposes a numerical strategy for an implementation of the dynamics .",
    "we summarize our strategy for the present and future work in the conclusions .",
    "there are several alternative ways to establish a variational self - consistent formulation of the dynamical evolution , and although all of them are equivalent , some particular implementation may present some practical advantages over others .",
    "thus we begin the program of setting up the variational self - consistent formulation by first studying the different implementations , discussing their merits and drawbacks , and choosing a particular formulation that would lead to an economical numerical implementation .",
    "the method for obtaining a time dependent _ variational approximation _ to the non - equilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory is to start with dirac s variational principle for obtaining the functional schrdinger equation .",

    "the initial data for the other kernels is determined by    @xmath415 g(\\vec x,\\vec x',t=0 ) = \\left[\\nabla^2_{x ' } - m^2(\\vec x',t=0)\\right ] g(\\vec x,\\vec x',t=0 ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sum_k \\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\psi_k(\\vec x ) \\psi^*_k(\\vec x')\\label{nablag0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that whereas the individual kernels evaluated at the initial time are divergent , the combination of the kernels that enter in the update equations above are _ finite _ and lead to the following result for the initial value problem @xmath416    _ if _ the expectation value @xmath417 were a solution of the time independent evolution equation for the expectation value , we would have found an equilibrium self - consistent solution of the quantum back - reaction problem .",
    "however , as we pointed out before , the self - consistent profile for @xmath417 is _ not _ a static solution of the evolution equation and in the second step of the update , @xmath417 will begin to evolve and with it the effective mass squared @xmath418 for the quantum fluctuations .      in this case case",
    "the heisenberg field expansion is as given in eq.([modexp3d ] ) but with the frequencies @xmath419 replaced by the frequencies given by eq .",
    "( [ smallk]-[delta2 ] ) . in this case",
    "we find the same expression for either the @xmath3 or @xmath4 dimensional cases where the frequencies @xmath419 in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ gini3d ] ) are given by eqs.([smallk]-[delta2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath420    obviously the nonvanishing and positive expression ( [ dotd01 ] ) evaluated at @xmath421 which corresponds to the second derivative of @xmath16 with respect to time is a manifestation of the early exponential growth of the quantum fluctuations associated with the spinodal instabilities and particle production .",
    "the systems of update equations shown above displays explicitly that although the individual kernels @xmath422 have short distance singularities , these cancel in the combinations that are necessary for the update equations .",
    "insofar as the green s function @xmath423 is evaluated at separate spatial points it remains finite throughout the evolution since the initial value is finite and the update equations are in terms of finite quantities",
    ". however , once the coincidence limit is taken , quadratic and logarithmic divergences will appear in the short distance operator product expansion . from the time",
    "evolved value of @xmath423 we must now take the coincidence limit to construct the updated effective mass @xmath367 and the short distance divergences must be renormalized .",
    "however our previous analysis of the short distance divergences determines unambiguously the manner to obtain the fully renormalized equations . in @xmath3 dimensions",
    "the equations of motion are rendered finite by mass renormalization and the replacement @xmath424 where @xmath425 is the upper momentum cutoff . in three dimensions",
    "we can take the spatial coincidence limit of the green s function in the _ finite _ quantity @xmath426 with @xmath371 given by the expression ( [ finitemass ] ) .",
    "although implementing a full numerical study of the evolution equations with the self - consistent initial data is beyond the scope of this paper , we briefly describe how we will implement numerically the evolution in a forthcoming study .",
    "the implementation is obviously much simpler in the one dimensional case : one begins by discretizing space introducing a lattice cutoff @xmath427 and the upper momentum cutoff becomes @xmath428 , so that the integral for @xmath70 can now be done at once leading to function of @xmath429 . since eventually we are interested in the coincidence limit of @xmath430 we do not need to update the functions of two variables @xmath431 for the whole range of the two variables , the non - locality of the update equations are mild only requiring the derivatives at separate points .",
    "thus for fixed @xmath432 we can simply update the equations for @xmath433 just a few lattice spacings away in such a way that the discretized derivative does not introduce coincidences .",
    "the coincidence limit will correspond to writing @xmath434 and the renormalized green s function is obtained by subtracting the value of @xmath70 , in the limit when @xmath435 the renormalized green s function is insensitive to the short distance cutoff .    in @xmath4 dimensions",
    "the strategy consists of the discretization of space in a cubic lattice of equal spacing @xmath427 along all the directions .",
    "now the second derivatives needed in the update equations require storing the field configurations on 6 sites around the particular points @xmath436 , again since ultimately we are interested in local field configurations and the spatial coincidence limit we do not need to store the configurations for all of the range of @xmath138 but only in the immediate neighborhood of the point @xmath437 . for a lattice spacing @xmath427",
    "there corresponds an upper momemtum @xmath438 and the momentum integrals needed for @xmath70 are done with spherical symmetry and a radial upper momentum cutoff @xmath439 which is the radius of the spherical brillouin zone .",
    "the coincidence limit must be understood now as @xmath440 and for @xmath441 the renormalized quantity @xmath367 is insensitive to the short distance cutoff .    as discussed in the previous section within the context of renormalization ,",
    "the linear sigma model is a low energy theory with a cutoff @xmath442 and this restricts the value of the lattice spacing for a numerical analysis .",
    "there is , however , a much more stringent constraint on the sigma model description of low energy physics : this model does not include other important hadronic degrees of freedom such as the pseudoscalars @xmath443 with masses @xmath444 and vector mesons ( which determine pion electromagnetic form factors ) with masses @xmath445 .",
    "these constraints suggest that the actual physical cutoff for the sigma model is not much bigger than @xmath446 resulting in a lattice spacing such that @xmath447 .",
    "thus the combination of landau pole arguments and low energy constraints on the dynamics require that a physically reasonable lattice spacing for a numerical treatment be of the order of @xmath448 , which will not result in strong short distance effects in the update of the dynamical equations .",
    "in this article we focused on establishing a consistent framework to study the non - equilibrium evolution of inhomogeneous non - perturbative field configurations including quantum backreaction effects . the main goal is to provide numerically implementable schemes to study the time evolution of large amplitude field configurations including the quantum backreaction associated with particle production on the relaxational dynamics .",
    "we proposed a self - consistent variational approach to study the non - perturbative aspects of the evolution of large amplitude inhomogeneous configuration , and analyzed the available frameworks to implement them . since our main goal is to provide a _",
    "practical _ method amenable to numerical implementation we highlighted in detail the advantages and shortcomings of the different approaches .",
    "we recognized the main ingredients that are required for a practical numerical implementation of this program : i ) a set of _ local _ dynamical update equations both in space and time , ii ) a self - consistent solution of the initial value problem that provides the cauchy data at the initial time , iii ) renormalizability implemented at the level of the update equations , so as to ensure insensitivity to the lattice introduced in the numerical implementation . after analyzing several different manners to implement a variational , self - consistent treatment of the non - equilibrium dynamics for these inhomogeneous problems",
    ", we identified a formulation that leads to a closed set of _ local _ update equations .",
    "we then studied in detail the renormalizability of this set of equations in both one and three spatial dimensions .",
    "the study of the dynamics of non - perturbative inhomogeneous field configurations in one spatial dimension is warranted by the interest in understanding the dynamics of soliton configurations in the presence of quantum excitations , but also as model systems to test these methods in simpler settings .",
    "in one spatial dimension we provide simple self - consistent ansatz for the initial cauchy data in terms of exactly solvable potentials for the sine - gordon and @xmath0 model . in the sine gordon case the exact mass spectrum , s - matrix , form factors",
    "are known and this allowed us to compare this simple ansatz to exact quantum results .",
    "numerical resolution of the full set of variational equations should provide better approximations .    in three dimensions we focused on the linear sigma model in the large @xmath2 limit as a model for relaxation of non - perturbative coherent pion configurations such as disoriented chiral condensates .",
    "in this case we provided a self - consistent solution for the initial cauchy data in the case of cylindrical symmetry by extending the results from the one dimensional examples .",
    "we found that for large amplitude configurations a mechanism akin to the klein paradox resulting in particle production is responsible for novel spinodal instabilities that will lead to profuse pion production at low @xmath449 through the relaxation of the inhomogeneous condensate .",
    "furthermore we provided the full set of renormalized ( semi)local update equations that can be implemented numerically and discussed in detail the strategy for a practical implementation , which is the next step of the program and currently in progress .",
