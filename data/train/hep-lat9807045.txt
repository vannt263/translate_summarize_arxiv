    "it is well known that pure @xmath2 lattice gauge theory exhibits a phase transition separating a region where photons remain confined ( strong coupling regime ) and a coulombian region ( weak coupling ) .",
    "nevertheless , the order of such transition is rather controversial  @xcite .",
    "simulations on hypercubical lattices using the wilson form of the action shown the existence of a latent heat that seems to persist in the infinite volume limit  @xcite.if this transition is actually of first order , hence the gauge u(1 ) lattice theory would be lacking of a continuum limit .",
    "the seriousness of such a situation has motivated the appearance of two lines of study . the first one is intended to check if the unexpected first order nature of this phase transition is an `` accident '' of the simulation , originated by the imposition of an hypercubical lattice  @xcite , the periodic boundary conditions  @xcite , etc .",
    "the second line of work goes directly to the the physical origin of the phase transition , the monopole condensation  @xcite , and to the analysis of all related effects , as the presence of monopole percolation  @xcite , that can shadow the behavior of the phase transition .",
    "although the formulation of the compact pure gauge u(1 ) theory on a lattice is very simple , i.e. there are only phases associated to the links , obtaining reliable numerical results from simulations is a rather difficult task .",
    "the earlier numerical simulations of such a theory indicated actually a continuous phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the evidences which favor a first order transition appeared only when larger lattices and higher statistics were accessible  @xcite.however , numerical simulations on larger lattices are very difficult .",
    "this is originated mainly by the lack of tunneling between phases that become incredibly stable and difficult the statistical analysis .",
    "the ordinary wilson formulation of qed has the links as the basic variables representing the gauge field and therefore involves a gauge redundancy .",
    "a different implementation of qed on the lattice which avoid the gauge redundancy can be attained using a description directly in terms of the world - sheets of gauge invariant quantities or loop excitations .",
    "this is the lagrangian counterpart of the former introduced hamiltonian loop representation  @xcite .",
    "although the non - canonical nature of the loop algebra had made elusive this lagrangian formulation , in a previous set of papers  @xcite a procedure to cast loops into the so - called _ world - sheet formulation _ was introduced .    in this paper we present a large statistics analysis of the pure gauge u(1 ) lattice theory using the world - sheet formulation .",
    "the lattice action used is equivalent to the villain form . in this formulation",
    "basic variables are integer variables on the plaquettes .",
    "as we will comment , the thermodynamical behavior over the phase transition is different to the one obtained from a standard simulation .",
    "the persistent metaestability problems that appear in the simulations using the traditional formulation are absent in the case of the world - sheet formulation .",
    "this therefore makes this formulation a useful computational tool .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we summarize the basics of the world - sheet approach . in sec .",
    "iii we present the simulation method and the results using the world - sheet action corresponding to the villain u(1 ) theory .",
    "iv is devoted to the analysis of the critical exponents of the transition .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains the summary of the work and the main conclusions .",
    "qcd is generally defined in terms of local fields , quarks and gluons , but the physical excitations are extended composites : mesons and baryons .",
    "there is an alternative quantum formulation of yang - mills theories directly in terms of these extended excitations namely , the _ loop representation _  @xcite .",
    "the basis of the loop description of gauge theories can be traced to the idea of describing gauge theories explicitly in terms of wilson loops or holonomies  @xcite since yang  @xcite noticed their important role for a complete description of gauge theories .",
    "loops replace the information furnished by the vector potential . a description in terms of loops or strings ,",
    "besides the general advantage of only involving the gauge invariant physical excitations , is appealing because all the gauge invariant operators have a simple geometrical meaning when realized in the loop space .    the loop based approach of ref .",

    "that is , the gauss law is automatically satisfied .",
    "second , the formalism only involves gauge invariant objects .",
    "third , all the gauge invariant operators have a transparent geometrical meaning when they are realized in the loop space .    when this loop representation is implemented in the lattice it offers a gauge invariant description of physical states in terms of kets @xmath8 , where @xmath9 labels a closed path in the _ spatial _ lattice .",

    ", the wilson loop acts as the loop creation operator : @xmath15 the physical meaning of a loop may be deduced from ( [ eq : alg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : wloop1 ] ) , in fact @xmath16 which implies that @xmath17 is an eigenstate of the electric field .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is different from zero if the link @xmath11 belongs to @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath9 represents a line of electric flux .    in order to cast the loop representation in lagrangian form",
    "it is convenient to use the language of differential forms on the lattice of ref .  @xcite .",
    "besides the great simplifications to which this formalism leads its advantages consists in the general character of the expressions obtained .",
    "that is , most of the transformations are independent of the space - time dimension or of the rank of the fields .",
    "so let us summarize the main concepts and some useful results of the differential forms formalism on the lattice .",
    "a k - form is a function defined on the k - cells of the lattice ( k=0 sites , k=1 links , k=2 plaquettes , etc . ) over an abelian group which shall be * r * , * z * , or u(1)=reals module 2@xmath18 .",
    "integer forms can be considered geometrical objects on the lattice .",
    "for instance , a 1-form represents a path and the integer value on a link is the number of times that the path traverses this link .",
    "@xmath19 is the co - border operator which maps k - forms onto ( k+1)-forms .",
    "it is the gradient operator when acting on scalar functions ( 0-forms ) and it is the rotational on vector functions ( 1-forms ) .",
    "we shall consider the scalar product of p - forms defined @xmath20 where the sum runs over the k - cells of the lattice . under this product",
    "the @xmath19 operator is adjoint to the border operator @xmath21 which maps k - forms onto ( k-1)-forms and which corresponds to minus times the usual divergence operator .",
    "that is ,    @xmath22    the co - border @xmath19 and border @xmath21 operators verify @xmath23    the laplace - beltrami operator operator is defined by @xmath24 it is a symmetric linear operator which commutes with @xmath19 and @xmath21 , and differs only by a minus sign from the current laplacian @xmath25 . from eq.([eq : box ] ) is easy to show the hodge - identity :    @xmath26    after this parenthesis on differential forms on the lattice let us consider the generating functional for the wilson lattice u(1 ) action : @xmath27 where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath28 stand for the lattice links and plaquettes respectively .",
    "fourier expanding the @xmath29 $ ] we get @xmath30 which can be written , using the differential forms language as @xmath31 in the above expression , @xmath32 is a real periodic 1-form , that is , a real number @xmath33 $ ] defined on each link of the lattice ; @xmath19 is the co - border operator ; @xmath34 are integer 2-forms , defined at the lattice plaquettes . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : inter ] ) and integrating over @xmath32 we obtain a @xmath35 .",
    "then , the partition function can be written as @xmath36 the constraint @xmath37 means that the sum is restricted to @xmath38 2-forms .",
    "thus , the sum runs over collections of plaquettes constituting closed surfaces .",
    "an alternative and more easy to handle lattice action than the wilson action is the villain action .",
    "the partition function for this action is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "if we use the poisson summation formula @xmath41 and we integrate the continuum @xmath42 variables we get @xmath43 where @xmath44 in the number of plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "again , we can use the equality : @xmath45 and integrating over @xmath46 we obtain a @xmath47 . hence we get : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are integer 2-forms .",
    "( [ eq : vill ] ) is obtained from eq.([eq : wil ] ) in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "if we consider the intersection of one of such surfaces with a @xmath51 plane we get a loop @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to show that the creation operator for this loop is just the creation operator for the loop representation i.e. the wilson loop operator . repeating the steps from eq.([eq : villain ] ) to eq.([eq : vill ] ) we get for @xmath53 @xmath54 this is a sum over all world - sheets spanned on the loop @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , we have arrived to an expression of the partition function of compact electrodynamics in terms of the world - sheets of pure electric loop excitations .",
    "notice that the loop action corresponding to the villain action is proportional to the @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 : @xmath58 i.e. the sum of the squares of the multiplicities @xmath59 of plaquettes which constitute the loop s world sheet @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of this action with the continuous nambu action or its lattice version , the weingarten action  @xcite , which is proportional to the area swept out by the bosonic string .",
    "we simulated the loop lattice action of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a2 ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we shown that this action is equivalent to the integer gaussian model ( igm ) that , in turn , it can be also reached as a limit of the non compact scalar qed in the limit of infinite higgs coupling . in that paper",
    "we presented a direct simulation of the igm which from the analysis of the energy histograms showed clearly the first order nature of the transition .",
    "nevertheless , we did not computed the critical exponents of the phase transition .",
    "here we have performed a more quantitative study and computed the exponents of the phase transition .",
    "we applied the simulation method introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "this method consists in generating collections of integer variables attached to plaquettes which form surfaces with the appropriate constraints for each model ( null frontier in the present pure gauge case ) .",
    "the variables are updated by means of a standard metropolis monte carlo algorithm .",
    "these larger simulations produced a phase transition for the coupling constant @xmath61 i.e. @xmath62 which is slightly higher than the previous value of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the physical magnitudes measured under the simulation are the internal energy and the specific heat both normalized to the number of plaquettes @xmath64 : @xmath65 on @xmath66 .",
    "the details of the run are the following :    * hypercubical lattice ( that is , periodic boundary conditions ) * sizes ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . * good statistics , more than 100 times the self - correlations .",
    "it means millions of iterations for @xmath68 . * in order to locate the transition and the specific heat peaks , we did nt do thermal cycles .",
    "instead we used iteratively ferrenberg - swedsen reweighting until a two peaks histogram were found .",
    "we made a fss analysis for the following quantities :    * the specific heat maxima @xmath69  (  [ subsec : loops : critic : cv ] ) .",
    "* the critical coupling position @xmath70  (  [ subsec : loops : critic : betacrit ] ) . * the partition function zeroes in the complex plane .",
    "(  [ subsec : loops : critic : leeyang ] ) .",
    "* the latent heat , that is the distance between the two peaks  (  [ subsec : loops : critic : deltae ] ) .",
    "the calculations have been performed in pentium computers running linux ( including the rtnn machine of 32 pentium pro processors at 200mhz ) .",
    "as it is expected , the elapsed time in the runs grows with the volume of the lattice obeying the following relation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the elapsed time for a pentium pro 200mhz running a million of iterations .",
    "we have been very careful with the statistical analysis of such a transition .",
    "we have measured the autocorrelations , @xmath73 , of the time - series for each lattice size in order to determine both , the number of thermalization iterations and the number of measures to obtain a significative number of independent measures .",
    "it is accepted @xcite that about @xmath74 iterations are enough in order to have the series thermalized and about @xmath75 to have a sufficiently large time series .",
    "table  [ tab : correlations ] collects this data .",
    ".correlations [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : loops : cvmax ] shows the measured values of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "notice the alignment of the points , exhibiting a 1st order behavior .",
    "solid line is the 1st order fit using only values @xmath78 .",
    "the critical coupling must reach their asymptotic behavior obeying the following laws , @xmath79 it is common to say that 1st order transition have a `` critical exponent '' of @xmath80 ( = 0.25 in 4 dimensions ) .",
    "trivial 2nd order transitions have @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , some weak 1st order transitions have an intermediate exponent and is not easy to elucidate the order of the transition from this scaling law . in our case",
    ", the errors are so large that all the fits are equally `` good '' and therefore this quantity does not provide much evidence on the order of the phase transition .",
    "the zeroes of the partition function analytically extended to the complex plane manifest a scaling behavior governed by the critical exponent @xmath82@xcite table  [ tab : loops : observables ] show the location of the zeroes closest to the real axis . from this data ,",
    "a fit to the imaginary part of @xmath83 gives @xmath84    this quantity is rather insensitive to the finite size effects .",

    "among different appealing features the world - sheet formulation avoids the summation over redundant gauge configurations .",
    "this fact implies an amelioration of the convergence to the equilibrium . as a consequence ,",
    "the time series generated using this approach show a high degree of `` tunneling '' between phases , a phenomenon that is depressed in the standard wilson formulation .",

    "wether or not this observed first order signature is an artifact of the topology / boundary - conditions of the lattice is an issue we will analyze in a future work .",
