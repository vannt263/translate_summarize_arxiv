    "the motivation for studying antiproton ( @xmath0 ) collisions is manifold and only a selection of motives shall be mentioned here .",
    "first of all , there is a general interest in collisions with exotic particles .",
    "second , @xmath0  scattering is a fundamental collision system due to the fact that the projectile is heavy and has a negative charge resulting in several advantages .",
    "for example , antiprotons do not capture electrons leading essentially to a one - center problem .",
    "they approximately follow a classical path down to velocities slower than the bohr velocity . and",
    "even very slow @xmath0  are still able to ionize making the investigation of `` adiabatic '' collisions possible .",
    "third , a comparison of results obtained from @xmath0  and @xmath1 scattering yields differential information on the collision process .",
    "the present motivation originates also from other aspects .",
    "one is the facility design for the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) including the facility for low - energy antiproton and ion research ( flair ) . in order to set the requirements of the ( low - energy ) @xmath0  storage rings correctly the influence of residual - gas atoms and molecules on the @xmath0  beam has to be known .",
    "therefore , quantities like the stopping power or the diffraction of the @xmath0  beam due to collisions are of interest .",
    "furthermore , a theoretical data base of @xmath0  cross sections for various atomic and molecular targets should be provided in view of future experiments at the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) at cern and also under improved conditions at the upcoming flair .    during the last decades advances",
    "have been achieved in the understanding of @xmath0  collisions with the simplest one- and two - electron atoms h and he . however , in the case of @xmath0  + he experiment and theory did not agree for impact velocities below the mean electron velocity of the ground state for more than a decade stimulating a vivid theoretical activity .",
    "the discrepancy has been partly resolved by very recent measurements on @xmath0  + he by knudsen _",
    "_ @xcite .    on the other hand , the literature on @xmath0  collisions with alkali - metal atoms",
    "is sparse .",
    "no measurement has been performed so far and only two calculations for li and na targets by stary et al .",
    "@xcite as well as by mccartney and crothers  @xcite , and recently results for li , na and k atoms @xcite were presented .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact , that alkali - metal atoms are in principal theoretically and experimentally feasible due to their electronic shell structure .",
    "all core electrons fill inner closed shells while a single valence electron occupies an outer s ( @xmath2 ) state .    in this work results for ionization and excitation in @xmath0  collisions with rb atoms",
    "are discussed and compared to previous findings for the alkali - metal atoms li , na and k @xcite as well as to calculations with an atomic h target .",
    "electron - energy spectra are determined and are exemplarily shown for rb .",
    "furthermore , electronic stopping powers are presented for @xmath0  collisions with li , na , k and rb .",
    "the used method has already been discussed elsewhere in some detail @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the major approximations , the description of the target atoms , as well as the general concept are briefly reviewed in the following section .",
    "atomic units are used unless otherwise stated .",
    "the collision process is considered in a semi - classical way using the impact parameter method .",
    "thereby , the electrons of the target atoms are treated quantum mechanically while the projectile moves on a straight classical trajectory @xmath3 given by the impact parameter @xmath4 and the velocity @xmath5 which are parallel to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axis , respectively and @xmath8 is the time .",
    "an effective one - electron description @xmath9 of the collision process is used @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electron coordinate , @xmath12 is the charge of the projectile , and @xmath13 is the time - independent target hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath14 is expanded in eigenstates @xmath15 of @xmath16 centered on the target nucleus .",
    "the model potential @xmath17 used for the effective one - electron description of the alkali - metal atoms was proposed by klapisch @xcite and the potential parameters are take from @xcite .",
    "the radial part of the @xmath15 is expanded in b - spline functions while the angular part is expressed in spherical harmonics .",
    "the expansion @xmath18 leads to coupled differential equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath19 for every trajectory , i.e. , for every @xmath20 and impact energy @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the antiproton mass .",
    "the cross section @xmath23 for an explicit @xmath24 for a transition from the initial state to @xmath15 is given by @xmath25 where the cylindrical symmetry of the collision system has been used .",
    "the electronic energy loss cross section is then given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energies of the ground and the @xmath29-th state , respectively .",
    "the cross sections for ionization and excitation are given by the sum of all @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_section ] ) for transitions into states @xmath15 with positive and negative energies @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the method was extensively tested by studying its convergence behavior and , additionally , by detailed comparisons of proton ( @xmath1 ) cross sections obtained with the same approach with literature results @xcite . also , a detailed comparison to the two already mentioned works @xcite which address @xmath0  collisions with li and na can be found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present method was successfully applied to the calculation of collisions including an h@xmath30target treated as an effective one - electron system @xcite .",
    "therefore , no further testing of the method is presented here .",
    "the ionization cross sections for @xmath0  collisions with rb are compared in to the results for li , na , k and h @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the curves for all alkali - metal atoms share the same qualitative behavior .",
    "they differ , however , in the magnitudes of the maxima which are order according to the chemical element . the larger the group number in the periodic table the higher the maximum of the ionization cross section . while this ordering is also prominent at low energies the differences between the atoms vanish at high impact energies .    for comparison",
    "also the well known ionization cross sections for @xmath0  + h collisions are given in .",
    "similar results for h might be expected since it is in the same group in the periodic table as the alkali - metal atoms . however , there are also obvious differences .",
    "namely , the magnitudes of the cross sections for the alkalis and the h atom differ considerably and only become comparable at high impact energies @xmath31 kev .",
    "also the position of the maximum for h is shifted from @xmath32 5 kev for the alkalis to @xmath3225 kev for h. the differences of the magnitudes of the ionization curves among the alkalis as well as between the alkalis and the h atom in can be explained with the different ionization potentials of the target atoms @xcite .    a comparison to the results for @xmath1 collisions is not shown here .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the findings for @xmath1 differ considerably from those for @xmath0  for energies @xmath33 kev @xcite . for these energies",
    "the electron loss in the case of @xmath1 impact is much larger than for @xmath0  collisions .",
    "this is due to the fact that electron capture becomes the dominant loss process at low @xmath1 impact energies which is excluded for @xmath0 .      in the excitation",
    "cross sections for @xmath0   collisions with rb are compared to the results for li , na , k and h @xcite .",
    "again , all curves for the alkali - metal atoms share the same qualitative behavior but differ in the magnitudes of their maxima .",
    "the maxima are , however , not ordered by chemical element . here ,",
    "li lies above na .",
    "the maxima of the curves are at higher impact energies  na , k , rb@xmath3215 kev and li@xmath328 kev  compared to ionization . in absolute values all curves lie clearly above the results for ionization in whereas the curves for li and na as well as for k and rb are close to each other . on the other hand , the slope of the curve for li is more similar to that of k and that of na more similar to that of rb .",
    "a comparison to the results for excitation of the h atom where the maximum is around 50 kev shows that the difference is even larger than in the case of ionization .",
    "the differences for excitation among the alkalis as well as between the alkalis and the h atom can be explained with the different excitation energies , especially for the lowest excited p state ( @xmath34 ) which is the most prominent transition at high and intermediate @xmath24 @xcite . the excitation energy for the 1s  2p transition in h with 0.375 a.u .",
    "is in particular large compared to , e.g , the 5s ",
    "5p with 0.058 a.u .  for rb .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath0  excitation results to @xmath1 collisions with alkalis yields , in contrast to ionization , no large differences @xcite .",
    "this could have been expected since no additional excitation mechanism for one of the two projectiles exists . however , smaller differences for @xmath0  and @xmath1 impact exist and will be discussed elsewhere .      besides total cross sections for ionization and excitation also differential",
    "information can be extracted from the collision process . in the electron - energy spectrum , i.e. , the cross section that an electron is emitted with the energy @xmath35 is presented for a rb atom target .",
    "the spectra of the other alkali - metal atoms li , na , and k were also determined .",
    "they are qualitatively comparable to that of rb and are therefore not shown here .",
    "spectra for seven different @xmath0  impact energies @xmath36 kev are given .",
    "all curves are smooth , fall off with increasing @xmath35 and no resonance structures can be seen for @xmath0impact which is also the case for @xmath0  + h@xmath30  collisions @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the spectra for electron loss in the case of @xmath1 collisions where a pronounced resonance can be observed for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the resonance originates from the electron capture process by the @xmath1 .",
    "thereby , the ionized and then captured electron moves with approximately the velocity @xmath5 of the @xmath1 .    for lower impact energies",
    "@xmath24 the maxima of the spectra at @xmath38 are higher and the decrease of the curve with increasing @xmath35 is steeper . for small electron energies",
    "@xmath38 the curves are ordered according to their impact energy @xmath24 . for larger electron energies",
    "@xmath39 the spectra all share the same behavior .",
    "always the uppermost curve crosses all lower - lying curves belonging to larger @xmath24 .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in the inset in ; first for the spectrum for @xmath24=1 kev and then for that for @xmath24=4 kev .",
    "consequently , the mean kinetic energy of the ionized electrons @xmath40 increases for larger impact energies @xmath24 of the @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained differential information on ionization and excitation can be used for the determination of the cross section for electronic energy loss also referred to as stopping power @xmath41 .",
    "results for @xmath0  collisions with li , na , k , rb , and h are shown in .",
    "a comparison of the present findings for @xmath0  + h with an atomic orbital calculation by grande and schiwietz @xcite yields good agreement and confirms therefore the present implementation .    as could have been expected from the results for ionization and excitation the electronic energy loss for h targets is smaller than for the alkali - metal atoms . on the other hand",
    ", the difference of @xmath41 between h and alkali - metal atoms is , especially for high @xmath24 , not very large .",
    "this can be understood regarding eq .",
    "( [ eq : stopping_power ] ) where the @xmath23 are weighted with the excitation energies ( @xmath42 ) which are clearly larger for excitations of an h atom . the differences for li and",
    "na observed for ionization and excitation compensate each other for the electronic energy loss .",
    "also , the results for k and rb are very similar . in general",
    ", it is possible to conclude that in the case of @xmath0  impact the electronic stopping power of alkali - metal atoms is dominated by the excitation process .",
    "therefore , a large stopping power can be found for all alkali - metal atoms at @xmath43 kev in a narrow impact energy range when considering the energy loss on a linear @xmath24 scale .",
    "besides the electron - energy spectrum also the angular distribution of the ionized electrons can be analyzed in order to obtain doubly - differential cross sections since the wave function @xmath14 is fully known ( at every time step ) .",
    "currently , the method is extended to treat also molecular targets .",
    "calculations for h@xmath30  using a one - electron model potential of the target have already been performed @xcite . a further development including a full two - electron description of the collision process is in progress which considers also molecular properties .",
    "once a two - electron description is implemented it can be used for atomic targets , too . in the limit of vanishing internuclear distance , e.g. ,",
    "he atoms could be used in order to test the implementation . but also calculations for , e.g. , alkaline earth metals can easily be done , if again model potentials are used ."
