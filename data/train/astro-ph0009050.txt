    "predict that an order of magnitude more satellites should be associated with the milky way and m31 than are actually observed .",
    "this discrepancy is a significant challenge to hierarchical clustering scenarios",
    ". an intriguing suggestion as to the whereabouts of the `` missing '' satellites is provided by the local group infall model of blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who speculate that a large fraction of the classical ensemble of hvcs are these local group building blocks .",
    "the continuing infall of the hvcs onto the disk of the galaxy would then provide the bulk of the fuel necessary to maintain ongoing star formation .",
    "hvcs are ubiquitous ( @xmath020% sky covering fraction ) clouds seen in hi emission , whose velocities are incompatible with simple models of galactic rotation . because the majority of their distances are effectively unconstrained , rampant speculation exists as to their exact nature and origin , ranging from solar metallicity galactic fountain gas ( @xmath1kpc and z@xmath0z@xmath2 ) , to magellanic cloud tidal debris ( @xmath3kpc and z@xmath40.25z@xmath2 ) , to the blitz / spergel local group formation remnants ( @xmath5kpc and 0.0@xmath6z@xmath60.1z@xmath2 ) .    the fact that each scenario makes specific predictions regarding the distance and metallicity for the `` typical '' hvc means that , in principle , the above models could be distinguished from one another wth appropriate observations . in practice ,",
    "the definitive observational discriminant has been difficult to obtain .",
    "the cleanest discriminant between the competing hvc models is that of their distance . if it could be shown that the majority of hvcs reside in the galactic halo , as opposed to being distributed throughout the local group",
    ", one could sound the death knell for the blitz / spergel model .",
    "unfortunately , direct distance determinations for hvcs are few and far between ; to set a useful upper limit requires a suitably bright background halo star of known distance to lie directly behind a high hi column density hvc .",
    "the dearth of catalogued blue horizontal branch stars and early subdwarfs in the outer halo ( rr  lyrae stars can sometimes be employed , in a pinch ) is one immediate problem ; those bright enough to obtain high s / n , high - resolution spectra ( to actually search for hvc absorption features ) are rarer still .",
    "non - detections ( both for foreground and background probes ) are more difficult to interpret , as fine - scale hi structure may conspire to make the probe `` miss '' any intervening hi .    to date , there are only five hvcs for which either an upper limit or distance bracket exists . as table  1 shows , of these five hvcs none is consistent with an intra - local group residence , as might be expected under the blitz / spergel picture . an ongoing attempt to detect complex  wd in absorption towards a distant halo rr  lyrae star",
    "may soon add a sixth entry to table  1 ( comeron 2000 ) .",
    "a few other hvcs have solid lower distance limits , but they do not provide any discriminant between halo and local group residence ( being only @xmath41@xmath75kpc ) . these are therefore not reported here .",
