    "structural phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes@xcite receive much attention for both fundamental and technological reasons .",
    "the occurrence of a soft mode is accompanied by a variety of striking effects , such as very large responses ( elastic , dielectric , piezoelectric ) and highly tunable properties , that can be exploited in applications .",
    "hence , there is interest in controlling the transition temperature @xmath1 , as this will in turn determine the functional properties of the material at specific ( e.g. , ambient ) conditions .",
    "this interest is being refueled by evidence that tuning the structural behavior provides us with convenient strategies to enhance other important properties , such as the magnetoelectric response.@xcite    from a designer s perspective , it would be useful to have simple rules to estimate @xmath1 from limited information about a compound . in particular ,",
    "if we were able to identify a simple _ predictor _ that allowed us to guess @xmath1 from routine first - principles calculations , we could accelerate the discovery of materials that take advantage of soft mode - related effects .",
    "such a knowledge would also be relevant to the construction of effective potentials for simulations of lattice - dynamical phenomena , as it would tell us which key properties the models must reproduce to render accurate @xmath1 s .",

    "is coupled to its nearest neighbors ( n.n . ) by a spring constant @xmath9 ( here we take @xmath10 ) that determines the dispersion of the associated phonon band [ see fig .",

    ". these are all rather surprising notions .",
    "to shed light on these issues , we conducted a series of numerical experiments using a model potential for pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) .",
    "pto presents a prototypic structural transition , between high - temperature cubic and low - temperature tetragonal structures , and is representative of the class of materials for which empirical rules like eq .",
    "( [ eq : empirical ] ) have been observed to hold .",
    "the employed model describes pto in full atomistic detail , and its parameters can be modified by hand to study the resulting changes in @xmath1 .",

    "the series was truncated at 4th order and only pairwise interaction terms were included .",
    "hence , in essence , our pto model can be seen as an extended version of the @xmath3 hamiltonian in which all the degrees of freedom are treated explicitly .",

    ", we also ran simulations in which , for each new temperature @xmath34 , we used a representative configuration of the previous temperature considered @xmath32 to initialized the mc simulations ; we found that the hysteresis , if present , is narrower than what we claim for the accuracy of the @xmath1 determination.@xcite from the obtained thermal averages , we estimate @xmath1 by a simple and robust fitting to the @xmath35 profile , as described in the appendix .",
    "octahderal rotations discussed in section  iii . in the ti ",
    "ti case , the interaction involves displacements orthogonal to the direction defined by the pair of atoms involved . the modified interaction controls the transversal modulation of the fe instability as we move away from the center of the brillouin zone . ]    we began by checking how the separate variations of the ground state energy @xmath16 and polarization @xmath36 affect @xmath1 . to do so , we constructed models whose associated energy wells are shown in fig .",

    "such models were obtained by tuning some of the interactions controlling the fe instability , namely , the harmonic and 4th - order couplings between neighboring ti and o atoms ( see sketch in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "finally , let us mention that the potential parameters we modified do not interfere with the energetics of the pto modes involving rotations of the oxygen octahedra ; hence , our changes did not affect significantly the instability competition discussed below .    note that we decided to use @xmath36 as a measure of the total distortion @xmath28 .",
    "besides its historical motivation,@xcite this choice is reasonable because in pto all the individual atomic displacements , as well as the cell strain , add up to the total polarization of the ground state .",

    "an important difference , though , is that such a modification of our potential involves changes in the dispersion of the phonon bands .",
    "for example , table  [ table ] gives information about a couple of constant-@xmath45 models that present different @xmath36 values [ see potentials labeled `` ( ti  o)@xmath46 '' , where the notation indicates the highest - order coupling that was modified to construct them ] . the @xmath50 parameter given in the table",

    "( [ eq : mean - field ] ) .",
    "thus , a reduction in @xmath1 for increasing @xmath36 does not necessarily imply the failure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean - field ] ) .",
    "we were able to specifically confirm the influence of @xmath50 on the obtained @xmath1 s .",
    "to do so , we constructed models in which @xmath50 was modified while keeping @xmath38 and @xmath37 constant , which required the introduction of an additional harmonic coupling between neighboring ti atoms ( see sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "table  [ table ] shows the results for two representative cases , labeled `` ( ti  ti)@xmath52 '' .",
    "the observed behavior makes good physical sense : a larger @xmath50 implies a greater energy cost for the occurrence of inhomogeneous locally - polar distortions that are mutually exclusive with the dominant fe soft mode , and hence results in a higher @xmath1 .",

    "predicts that our model with @xmath53  =  1.10 and @xmath54  =  0.92 should present an enhancement of about 11% in @xmath1 ; however , such a prediction is in obvious disagreement with the computed decrease .",
    "interestingly , it may seem that our data suggest an alternative predictor for @xmath1 .",
    "for the models in table  [ table ] , we report the curvature of the @xmath55 curve at @xmath56 [ @xmath57 or @xmath58 in fig .  [ fig1](a ) ] , which essentially corresponds to the parameter @xmath48 of the @xmath3 hamiltonian .",
    "this parameter measures how unstable the @xmath56 paraelectric ( pe ) state is : large negative values of @xmath59 imply a greater difficulty to stabilize the pe phase , and should thus correspond to higher @xmath1 s .",
    "hence , one may heuristically propose @xmath60 , which is essentially satisfied by all the models we studied .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the case of the `` ( ti  o)@xmath46 '' models in which we vary the ground state polarization at constant @xmath45 , changes in @xmath36 and @xmath61 are forcefully correlated , an increase of the former implying a decrease of the latter . hence , the @xmath62 and @xmath63 rules are incompatible in this case , and we find that the former matches our monte carlo results better .",
    "we further investigated the validity of this new rule by considering other modified models ( not shown here ) .",
    "ultimately , we found that , in the constant-@xmath45 `` ( ti  o)@xmath46 '' cases of table  [ table ] , we should attribute the changes in transition temperature to the variations in the @xmath64 parameter rather than to changes in @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , we did obtain additional indications of the importance of the details of the @xmath55 curve from our last set of modified models , which we describe in the following .    ''",
    "modified potentials described in the text .",
    "red and blue lines correspond to constant-@xmath36 and constant-@xmath2 models , respectively .",

    "doing this required the tuning of ti ",
    "o couplings up to 8th - order while keeping the harmonic interactions constant ; these models are labeled `` ( ti  o)@xmath66 '' in table  [ table ] .",
    "our results ratify that @xmath2 has a considerable impact on @xmath1 , in qualitative agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "we also find that varying @xmath36 alone has an effect on @xmath1 .",
    "however , once again we observe that a larger ground state distortion leads to a smaller transition temperature , in disagreement with initial expectations .",
    "when we examined this last set of modified models , we observed that a larger @xmath36 value corresponds to a shallower energy surface around the fe minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in view of this",
    ", we reexamined all our potentials and found that the curvature at @xmath67 , which we call @xmath68 in table  i , does correlate with the computed transition temperatures .",
    "we might thus speculate that , generally speaking , _ stiffer _ fe phases ( with larger @xmath68 values associated to them ) will be more difficult to destabilize , and will thus correspond to higher @xmath1 s .",
    "this observation suggests yet another heuristic predictor for the transition temperature , namely , @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the @xmath3 potential we have @xmath70 ; hence , in this case we can write @xmath71 , which coincides with the above mentioned predictor based on curvature of @xmath55 around @xmath56 .",
    "a natural next step would be to investigate models in which we would keep all the parameters in table  i constant except for @xmath2 or @xmath36 .",
    "this would require our introducing couplings of even higher order , and producing ever more artificial potentials .",
    "hence , we did not pursue this line any further .",
    "in view of these results , what is the status of the predictors for @xmath1 mentioned in the introduction ?",
    "are our findings compatible with existing literature ?",
    "what are the lessons to be learned ?",
    "we have found that the mean - field result for the @xmath3 model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean - field ] ) ] , which is essentially equivalent to the formulas proposed by a number of authors,@xcite does not give an accurate description of the behavior of our simulated materials .",
    "the main conflict concerns the qualitative dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath72 , as we have found that our simulations render a behavior ( @xmath1 decreases with growing @xmath72 ) that is just opposed to the expected one .",
    "this is a serious discrepancy , as the @xmath3 model can be seen as a simplified version of our pto potential , and we certainly expect its behavior to be qualitatively well captured by the mean - field approximation .",
    "hence , how can we explain this apparent contradiction ?",
    "let us begin by noting that , while we are in principle entitled to associate parameters in the @xmath3 model with the analogous quantities for our pto potential , this correspondence is not a strict one .",
    "the @xmath3 model has only three independent constants  which we can choose to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] )  and , once those are given , we can write simple relationships between the derived quantities .",
    "thus , for example , the equality @xmath73 is always fulfilled by the @xmath3 potential . however , as one can easily check from the information in table  [ table ] , the analogous identity @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an appropriate constant , does not hold for our pto potentials . for example , for the model described in the second line of table  [ table ] we have @xmath76 , which differs a lot from @xmath77 .",
    "it is thus obvious that the relationships that are valid for the @xmath3 model , even the simplest ones pertaining to the ground state properties and potential shape , do not necessarily apply to more realistic models of structural transitions .",
    "the reason for such differences lies on the inherent complexity of our reference pto potential .",
    "indeed , even for a 4th - order model like ours , the energy well corresponding to the fe instability can effectively be of a higher polynomial order due to the anharmonic couplings between the unstable fe mode and other modes and strains in the material .",
    "this is a critical difference with respect to the @xmath3 model , and the likely cause of the discrepancies mentioned above . to understand this better ,",
    "consider the energy of a simple model @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the amplitude of a soft mode with an associated double - well potential ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 is the amplitude of a stable mode ( @xmath83 ) coupled with @xmath79 anharmonically .",
    "in such a case , it is easy to see that , upon condensation of @xmath84 , we get a secondary distortion @xmath85 where , for simplicity , to derive this expression we have assumed that @xmath82 will always be relatively small . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : secondary - mode ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - model ] ) we get a renormalized energy for @xmath79 that reads @xmath86 which is effectively of 12th order . [ the @xmath87 term that eventually leads to the @xmath88 contribution has been included here to make it clear that the renormalized energy continues to be bounded from below , despite the @xmath89 term being negative .",
    "] this example constitutes a realistic description of how the fe soft mode ( @xmath79 ) and other @xmath51-point modes with the same polar symmetry ( @xmath82 ) interact anharmonically .",
    "such couplings are responsible for a variety of effects in pto , such as the significant differences that exist between the atomic displacements corresponding to the fe ground state and those associated with the eigenvector of the fe soft mode of the cubic phase , etc .",
    "the precise list of anharmonic couplings in our pto potential can be found in table  1 of ref .  .",
    "it is clear that our model for pto is closer to reality than the simple @xmath3 hamiltonian .",
    "hence , one may wonder : do our results imply that the @xmath90 rule should not be able to describe real materials ? to answer this question , let us note that the modified models considered in this work correspond to somewhat artificial situations in which changes in @xmath36 and @xmath2 are strictly decoupled .",
    "in contrast , in reality one expects strong soft mode instabilities to involve large values of _ both _ @xmath16 and @xmath36 .",
    "( this is indeed what we obtain for our pto model when we simply crank up the magnitude of the interactions responsible for the fe instability without imposing any constraint . ) hence , leaving aside unusual choices of potential parameters , we can generally expect @xmath91 , where @xmath92 measures the _ strength _ of the structural instability , and @xmath25 and @xmath93 are two positive numbers . in other words , in general we expect @xmath22 and @xmath16 to be essentially equivalent as @xmath1 predictors .",
    "now , even though they may correspond to unusual situations , the unexpected results that we obtained for our modified models with constant-@xmath45 do suggest some relevant conclusions . as mentioned above ,",
    "when subject to the constant-@xmath45 constraint , an increase of @xmath36 involves changes in the potential surface ( e.g. , around @xmath94 and/or @xmath67 ) that tend to result in a lower @xmath1 .",
    "this finding indicates that : ( 1 ) subtle changes in the potential surface can have an important impact on the computed transition temperature .",
    "as far as we know , this is an effect that had not been noticed before , and one that is important to keep in mind if we want to construct first - principles model potentials ( like those of ref .   and",
    "others@xcite ) that render accurate transition temperatures .",
    "( 2 ) the fundamental quantities for predicting @xmath1 are those directly related to the energy .",
    "thus , our results suggest that @xmath72 or @xmath22 may act as predictors only because their magnitude is usually connected with the strength of the structural instability . in contrast , @xmath16 is a fundamentally more robust predictor for @xmath1 .    of course",
    ", the above arguments imply that , in our opinion , our results are perfectly compatible with the empirical rule @xmath95 proposed by abrahams _",
    "et al_.@xcite in fact , it is worth mentioning that , when discussing the physical interpretation of their newly - found law , these authors viewed the value of @xmath22 as a measure of the `` thermal energy at the curie point '' .",
    "we believe that such an interpretation is the most natural one , and it falls in line with our conclusions .    finally , let us note that we numerically fitted our results for @xmath1 using an expression of the form @xmath96 where the exponents are adjustable real numbers .",
    "this exercise showed that the @xmath59 and @xmath68 parameters are comparatively unimportant for determining @xmath1 , and can be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "further , we obtained @xmath97 for @xmath2 , @xmath98 for @xmath36 , and @xmath99 for @xmath50 , reflecting the dominant role of the energy difference between the high- and low - symmetry structures .",
    "as expected from our results summarized in table  i , the magnitude of @xmath36 is found to be inversely proportional to @xmath1 . at the same time , in typical cases in which @xmath2 and @xmath36 are correlated and grow / decrease together , we can expect the @xmath39 term to dominate .",
    "let us now comment on the related works of grinberg and rappe@xcite and juhas _",
    "et al_.,@xcite who combined first - principles results and experimental information to empirically identify predictors for @xmath1 .",

    "interestingly , when discussing their @xmath107 rule , juhas _",

    "we have recent and clear evidence that this kind of competition has a large effect on the curie temperature of pto@xcite and related materials.@xcite in particular , as shown in ref .   for the case of our pto model ,",
    "it is possible to modify the energetics of the oxygen - octahedra rotations ( e.g. , artificially suppressing them ) and obtain an effect in @xmath1 ( a very large increase ) , even if all the key parameters describing the fe instability and ground state ( @xmath2 , @xmath36 , @xmath50 , @xmath59 , and @xmath68 ) remain constant .",
    "hence , _ a priori _ there is no reason to expect the above mentioned @xmath1 predictors to describe well the behavior of materials in which this type of _ hidden _ effects are important .",
    "in fact , it seems natural to suspect that departures from the _ normal _ behavior may indicate the presence of this kind of phenomena .",
    "one can thus conjecture that , in the cases considered in refs .   and ,",
    "larger displacements of the @xmath49-site cations probably correspond to weaker afd instabilities , which would in turn result in a less important competition and a higher @xmath102 .",
    "note that this connection is not inconsistent with the observation that , in the afd - dominated phases of many perovskite oxides , the @xmath49-site cations usually stay at the center of o@xmath108 octahedra .",
    "this tendency can be explained by the size effects captured by the so - called _ tolerance factor_.@xcite    it thus seems that the simple - looking predictor for @xmath109 proposed in refs .",
    "hides rather complex structural and lattice - dynamical mechanisms behind it .",
    "as just mentioned , in these pb - based relaxors @xmath22 seems to ( anti)correlate with the importance of the fe  afd competition , which in turn controls the ordering temperature .",
    "in contrast , due to the structural complexity of these materials , @xmath22 does not correlate well with the depth of the potential energy wells . in view of this , the results of refs .   can not be taken as support for the conclusions of abrahams _ et al_.,@xcite which rely on the connection between @xmath28 and @xmath2 as emphasized above .",
    "nevertheless , such results do show that , even in difficult cases involving competing instabilities , it may be possible to find predictors for @xmath1 associated with simple properties of the ground state .",
    "the possibility of extending such a conclusion to other materials with competing instabilities remains to be confirmed .",
    "abrahams _ et al_.@xcite noted that the validity of their simple empirical rule implies that very different materials must present similar properties of some sort . indeed , as discussed theoretically by lines,@xcite the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : empirical ] ) to a set of diverse ferroelectrics indicates that there exists an effective force constant ( in essence , this would be the proportionality constant between @xmath1 and @xmath22 ) that ( 1 ) is probably dominated by long - range dipole - dipole interactions and ( 2 ) is quantitatively similar for all the materials considered in ref .  .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with our results : we have found that variations in @xmath50 have a large impact on @xmath1 ; hence , if a @xmath1 predictor that disregards such variations applies to a set of materials , it follows that @xmath50 must be similar for all of them .",
    "we believe that , as long as we are dealing with _",
    "simple _ cases ( e.g. , in absence of a materials - dependent competition between structural instabilities ) , such reasonings probably apply . yet , in view of the above - described subtleties associated with the pb - based relaxors , it is legitimate to wonder how many intricate and material - specific behaviors are hiding behind the result of abrahams _",
    "et al_. , and how much their empirical rule really tells us about the nature of the interatomic interactions in each of the specific compounds they considered .    in the same spirit",
    ", grinberg and rappe@xcite suggested that the pto - based solid solutions they investigated must present somewhat similar landau potentials .",
    "more specifically , they worked with a landau energy of the form @xmath110 with @xmath111 , to justify the relationship @xmath112 and inferred that the compounds they studied ( for which @xmath113 is approximately constant ) must present comparable @xmath114 ratios .",
    "this is a tempting interpretation that seems to give us some physical insight into the energetics of the polar instabilities in these materials .",
    "however , noting that the findings of these authors on pb - based relaxors probably rely on subtle effects involving competing instabilities , and that such effects can not be modeled within a simple landau scheme , we should be careful to avoid overinterpreting such observations .",
    "finally , let us note that we have limited our discussion to @xmath23 predictors that have a clear justification , may it be empirical , theoretical , or heuristic .",
    "we have purposely avoided the consideration of other possibilities with a less clear basis .",
    "for example , it may be tempting to consider the landau potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : landau ] ) and derive possible rules like @xmath115 [ eq .  ( [ eq : tc - landau ] ) ] or @xmath116 ) for @xmath26 , and",
    "the latter may resemble eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , it must be emphasized that these identities can not be used to justify a predictor for @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that it is perfectly legitimate to choose @xmath1 , @xmath36 , and @xmath2 as independent parameters of the landau potential and , hence , no relationship among these quantities needs to hold .",
    "note , for example , that in addition to the two expressions just mentioned , we may write others such as @xmath117 , which renders a very different and equally unjustified relationship between our properties of interest .",
    "we have examined an effective model for pbtio@xmath0 , a material with a representative soft mode - driven structural transition , to investigate which features of the potential control the transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "our main result is that @xmath1 correlates strongly with the energy difference between the high - symmetry and low - symmetry structures ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "in contrast , we find that the magnitude of the symmetry - breaking distortion ( @xmath28 ) is a less robust predictor , although it can be expected to work well in typical cases in which @xmath16 and @xmath118 are strongly correlated .",
    "additionally , our results reveal the sizable impact that subtle features of the energy surface have on the computed @xmath1 , providing us with useful information for the construction of more accurate model potentials from first principles .    by comparing our results with existing literature",
    ", we can conclude that : ( 1 ) whenever simple @xmath1 predictors work well for a family of materials , this is indicative that the potentials of such compounds share some common features .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with previous observations by other authors.@xcite ( 2 ) whenever the simple predictors fail , this suggests the occurrence of subtle structural and lattice - dynamical effects involving strong anharmonic interactions between modes .",
    "we thus hope our results will bring new insights to the analysis of complex phase - transition and lattice - dynamical phenomena , and permit more effective computational works to design materials with tailored temperature - dependent properties .",

    "to analyze our data and determine @xmath1 for each considered model in a robust and reliable way , we employed a fitting procedure that assumes a heuristic form for @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , we used @xmath119 which depends on the three free parameters @xmath120 , @xmath1 , and @xmath121 .",
    "this functional form is compatible with the description of a second order phase transition ( which corresponds to @xmath122 within landau theory ) , and is also flexible enough to capture more complex behaviors appearing when the transition is discontinuous .",
    "( we numerically found that @xmath123 reproduces well the results for our reference model , as well as the typical first - order transition described by a sixth - order landau theory . ) the good quality of the fits can be appreciated in fig .",
