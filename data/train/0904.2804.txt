    "analytically consider and derive a suitable form for the variable eddington factor for a relativistic , plane - parallel , scattering medium , using a simple but physically consistent treatment of the radiation field in the optically thick regime .    in the next section",
    "we describe the shape of the surface where the optical depth measured by the comoving observer is unity , and in section 3 we derive its expression when the four - velocity gradient is large . in section 4",
    "we numerically calculate the comoving radiation field within the photo - oval , and the relativistic variable eddington factor . in section 5",
    ", we briefly discuss the present result and compare with the results of previous work .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose an optically thick , relativistic radiative flow , which is accelerated in the vertical ( @xmath6 ) direction , and a comoving observer , who moves upward with the flow , at an optical depth @xmath0 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)figure01.eps    sufficiently deep inside the flow , where the optical depth is very large , the mean free path of photons is very short .",
    "in such a case , within the range of the mean free path , for the comoving observer the flow is seen to be almost uniform ; the velocity gradient and resultant density gradient are negligible .",
    "hence , the mean free path is the same in all directions , and the shape of the surface where the optical depth measured from the comoving observer is unity , is almost a sphere ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - sphere _ ( a dashed circle in figure 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the comoving radiation field is nearly isotropic , and a usual eddington approximation in the comoving frame is valid .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity gradient becomes very large , the behavior of the radiation field may be affected by changes in the hydrodynamics of the flow even on a lengthscale comparable to that of the photon mean free path .",
    "hence , the mean free path becomes longer in the downstream direction than in the upstream and other directions , and the shape of the one - tau range elongates in the downstream direction ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - oval _ ( a dashed oval in figure 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the comoving radiation field becomes _ anisotropic _ , and we should modify the usual eddington approximation ; in these conditions the eddington factor may depend on the optical depth and the velocity gradient .",
    "in addition , when the optical depth is sufficiently small and/or the velocity gradient is suffiently large , the mean free path of photons in the downstream direction become less than unity . hence , the shape of the one - tau range is open in the downstream direction ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - vessel _ ( a dashed hemi - circle in figure 1 ) .    in order to obtain an appropriate form of the relativistic variable eddington factor in these regimes , we thus carefully treat and examine the radiation field in the comoving frame .    in a previous paper ( fukue 2008 , hereafter refered to as paper i ) , we have examined the one - tau photo - oval , derived the variable eddington factor in the non - relativistic regime , and proved that the eddington factor decreases with the velocity gradient . in paper",
    "i , however , the treatment was restricted to the non - relativistic regime of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the flow velocity @xmath10 normalized to the speed of light .",
    "in the present study , we thus examine the behavior of the relativistic variable eddington factor in the relativistic regime of @xmath11 , under the same approach of paper i. instead of @xmath8 , however , we use the four velocity @xmath2 ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the lorentz factor , and seek the appropriate form of @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we compute the shape of the one - tau photo - oval in a vertical , optically thick one - dimensional radiative flow under the linear approximation .",
    "we define the one - tau photo - oval as the surface where the optical depth measured by the comoving observer is unity .",
    "the situation is schematically illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "we assume that the comoving observer in the vertical flow is located at @xmath16,where the flow four speed is @xmath17 and the optical depth is @xmath18 . in the @xmath19-direction , that forms an angle @xmath20 with the downstream direction , the mean free path of photons is @xmath21 .",
    "the relation among these quantities is @xmath22    the continuity equation for the stationary , one - dimensional relativistic flow is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the proper gas density , @xmath2 the four velocity , and @xmath25 the mass - flow rate per unit area .",
    "in addition , the optical depth @xmath0 is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the opacity , which we assume constant in the present analysis .    in this paper",
    "we use a linear approximation for the flow field ; that is to say , around the position of the comoving observer the flow four speed is expanded as @xmath28    it should be noted that in paper i we expanded the flow speed @xmath8 , and derived several results analytically , restricting the treatment to the non - relativistic regime . instead , in the present paper we expand the four velocity @xmath2 , and examine the relativistic regime , although solutions must be calculated numerically .    under these assumptions ,",
    "we consider two different regimes , as outlined below .",
    "we first consider the linear regime , where the density is expanded as @xmath29 where we made use of the continuity equation ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "then the optical depth @xmath30 along the @xmath19-direction is easily calculated as @xmath31 ds % \\nonumber \\\\ %           & = & \\int_0^{l_0 } \\kappa \\left [ \\rho_0 + \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{du}\\frac{du}{dz}\\right|_0 ~s \\cos\\theta \\right ] ds % \\nonumber \\\\            & = & \\kappa\\rho_0 l_0 + \\kappa \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{du}\\frac{du}{dz}\\right|_0 \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{2 } l_0 ^ 2 . \\label{linear_tau_s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the length @xmath21 at which @xmath32 is determined by the quadratic equation , @xmath33    as is easily seen from equation ( [ linear_l0 ] ) , if there is no velocity gradient , @xmath34 , and the shape of the one - tau range is a sphere ( one - tau photo - sphere ) .",
    "the quadratic equation ( [ linear_l0 ] ) can be easily solved , giving @xmath35 where @xmath36    ( 80mm,80mm)figure03.eps    in figure 3 the solutions ( [ linear_kapparhol ] ) of the quadratic equation ( [ linear_l0 ] ) are shown for several values of the parameters @xmath37 ( 0.02 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.5 ) , from spherical to elongated . for @xmath38 , in the downstream direction there is no solution and the photo - oval is open , becoming a photo - vessel . it should be noted that our figure 3 is equivalent to figure 3 in paper i , although the definition of the parameter @xmath37 is different .    from the solution ( [ linear_kapparhol ] ) , the breakup condition , where the photo - oval is open in the downstream direction , is given by @xmath39 , or @xmath40 using the continuity equation ( [ rho ] ) and the optical depth ( [ tau ] ) , the breakup condition ( [ linear_breakup ] ) is also written as @xmath41 we have shown that both the shape of the one - tau photo - oval and its breakup condition depend on the _ velocity gradient_.      we next consider the semi - linear regime , where the density is given by continuity equation ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "when the flow speed is high and the density decreases , the mean free path of photons becomes large , and the one - tau range expands .",
    "in such a case , even if the flow field around the comoving observer is assumed to be linear in the manner of equation ( [ linear_u ] ) , there is no guarantee that , in this regime , the density distribution can be approximated by equation ( 5 ) .    using continuity equation ( [ rho ] ) ,",
    "the optical depth @xmath30 along the @xmath19-direction is expressed as @xmath42 from equations ( [ zz0 ] ) and ( [ linear_u ] ) , we have @xmath43 and the integral is transformed as @xmath44 where we use the assumption that the velocity gradient is constant around @xmath16 .",
    "this equation ( [ semi_tau_s2 ] ) is analytically integrated to give @xmath45    thus , the length @xmath21 at which @xmath32 is finally determined , with the help of equation ( [ semi_u ] ) and the definition of the optical depth ( [ tau ] ) , by the following equations : @xmath46 we finally obtain @xmath47    ( 80mm,80mm)figure04.eps    in figure 4 the one - tau length @xmath48 ( [ semi_l0final ] ) is plotted as a function of @xmath20 for several values of the parameters @xmath37 ( @xmath49 ) ( 0.1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , from spherical to elongated .",
    "when the velocity gradient is small , the photo - oval is spherical .",
    "as the ( logarithmic ) velocity gradient increases , it elongates in the downstream direction .",
    "however , in contrast to the linear case in the previous subsection or in paper i , for any values of @xmath37 equation ( [ semi_l0final ] ) has always solutions , and the photo - oval never break up in the downstream direction .",
    "we now derive an expression for the eddington factor in the comoving frame assuming that electron scattering is the dominant radiative process ; the radiation seen by a comoving observer is that emitted by the one - tau photo - oval around him ( figure 5 ) .    in a static and optically thick atmosphere , the radiation field is isotropic and uniform . in the present moving atmosphere ,",
    "on the other hand , there are two reasons for which the radiation field is not isotropic : the emitted intensity is not uniform , and it is redshifted because of velocity gradients . neglecting the local emissivity , the frequency - integrated intensity @xmath50 observed in the comoving frame at the position @xmath51 of the comoving observer is related to the frequency - integrated intensity @xmath52 emitted at the one - tau photo - oval and to the redshift @xmath6 by @xmath53    ( 80mm,80mm)figure05.eps    first , the radiative intensity @xmath52 in the comoving frame emitted from the one - tau photo - oval walls is not known without solving the full transfer problem .",
    "clearly , it is not generally constant , but is a function of @xmath6 ( or @xmath0 ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . if the optical depth is sufficiently large , the @xmath54-dependence may be safely ignored , and the emitted intensity can be assumed to be isotropic . in general , however , the radiative intensity increases with the optical depth , and therefore , the intensity from the upstream direction is slightly larger than that from the downstream direction in the present one - dimensional vertical flow .",
    "this effect of non - uniformity of intensity generally acts as a force to accelerate a comoving observer .",
    "as long as the intensity is a slowly increasing function of the optical depth , its non - uniformity does not affect significantly the radiation energy density and the radiation pressure , and therefore , the eddington factor ( see paper i ) .",
    "hence , in order to isolate the effects induced by the relative velocity between the comoving observer and the one - tau photo - oval , in this paper we assume that the intensity of the radiation emitted from the one - tau photo - oval surface is constant ; @xmath56 .",
    "second , the intensity observed by the comoving observer is redshifted ( doppler shifted ) due to the velocity difference between the comoving observer and the one - tau photo - oval walls . in an accelerating flow , where the flow speed increases toward the downstream direction ,",
    "the relative velocity is generally positive ( figure 5 ) except for some special direction ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "hence , the doppler shift of intensity also causes anisotropy of the radiation field at the position of the comoving observer .",
    "the relative speed @xmath58 between the comoving observer and the one - tau photo - oval walls is given by the relativistic summation law as @xmath59 where @xmath60    in addition , using equations ( [ semi_u0 ] ) and ( [ semi_l0final ] ) , the four velocity at @xmath6 is expressed as @xmath61 hence , all the necessary quantities are expressed as functions of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .    using the relative speed above , the redshift @xmath6 is expressed as @xmath65 and the observed intensity @xmath50 is given by equation ( 20 ) .",
    "furthermore , the radiation energy density @xmath66 , the radiative flux @xmath67 , and the radiation pressure @xmath68 measured by the comoving observer are calculated respectively as @xmath69 finally , the eddinton factor in the comoving frame is given by @xmath70    ( 80mm,80mm)figure06a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure06b.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure06c.eps    the numerical results of this calculation are shown in figure 6 . in the non - relativistic regime ( @xmath71 ) and for small velocity gradients , the eddington factor is roughly constant , as expected .",
    "that is , when the velocity gradient is relatively small , the eddington factor is almost 1/3 . as the velocity gradient becomes large",
    ", however , the eddington factor decreases , as found in paper i.    on the other hand , the behavior in the highly relativistic regime is somewhat different .",
    "as can be seen in figure 6 , in the relativistic regime , the eddington factor assumes constant values on the line @xmath72 . considering this behavior , in figure 7 we then plot @xmath73 as functions of the four velocity @xmath62 ( abscissa ) and the logarithmic velocity gradient @xmath37 ( @xmath49 ) ( ordinate ) .",
    "as is clearly seen in figure 7 , except for the non - relativistic regime ( @xmath74 ) , the eddington factor does depend only on the logarithmic velocity gradient @xmath37 .",
    "we found that this dependence of the eddington factor on @xmath37 is well approximated by @xmath75 in summary , the relativistic eddington factor in the vertical flow varies exponentially with the logarithmic velocity gradient in the relativistic regime .    in the present analysis ( and paper i ) we have assumed that the comoving intensity is uniform .",
    "hence , the above result is only due to the redshift effect .",
    "moment equations for relativistic radiation transfer have been studied extensively in literature ( lindquist 1966 ; anderson & spiegel 1972 ; hsieh & spiegel 1976 ; thorne 1981 ; thorne et al .",
    "1981 ; udey & israel 1982 ; schweizer 1982 ; flammang 1982 , 1984 ; nobili et al . 1991 , 1993 ; park 2001 , 2006 for spherically symmetric problems ; takahashi 2007 for the kerr metric ) .",
    "as the moment expansion gives rise to an infinite set of equations , one must truncate it at a finite order by adopting a suitable closure relation , in order to make the transfer problem solvable . when truncating at the second order , for example , in an optically thick flow the eddington approximation has been usually adopted as a closure relation .",
    "such radiation moment formalism is quite convenient , and it is a powerful tool for tackling problems of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "however , its validity is never known unless fully angle - dependent radiation transfer equation is solved .    indeed , in the relativistic regime , where the velocity gradient becomes large and doppler and aberration effects become important , even in the optically thick regime the isotropy of the radiation field may break down .",
    "in such a situation the eddington approximation can not be adopted in the comoving frame ( fukue 2005 ; see also fukue 2008 ) .    instead of the usual eddington approximation",
    ", we can adopt a _ variable eddington factor _ , which depends on the flow velocity @xmath10 and the velocity gradient @xmath76 as well as the optical depth @xmath0 ( fukue 2006 ; fukue & akizuki 2006 , 2007 ; akizuki & fukue 2008 ; koizumi & umemura 2008 ) . in one - dimensional flows the variable eddington factor @xmath77 is generally defined as @xmath78 where @xmath66 and @xmath68 are the radiation energy density and the radiation pressure in the comoving frame , respectively . in recent studies ( fukue 2006 ;",
    "fukue & akizuki 2006 , 2007 ; akizuki & fukue 2008 ; koizumi & umemura 2008 ) , the dependence of the variable eddington factor on the flow velocity has been considered .",
    "fukue ( 2008 ) has firstly examined the dependence of the variable eddington factor on the velocity gradient in the non - relativistic regime @xmath7 , obtaining : @xmath79    in this paper , using a similar approach , we have numerically obtained the eddington factor in the relativistic regime : @xmath80    unfortunately , this relation ( [ f_paper2 ] ) holds only in the relativistic regime and does not reduce to the relation ( [ f_paper1 ] ) in the low speed limit of @xmath81 .",
    "however , we can easily find the bridging formula , that reduces to equation ( [ f_paper1 ] ) in the non - relativistic limit and approaches equation ( [ f_paper2 ] ) in the highly relativistic limit , as @xmath82    thus , the relativistic eddington factor in an optically thick , plane - parallel flow linearly decreases as a function of the velocity gradient in the non - relativistic regime , and then exponentially decreases as a function of the logarithmic velocity gradient in the highly relativistic regime .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the eddington factor in a plane - parallel , relativistic and optically thick scattering medium that is accelerating in the vertical direction ; we have introduced the one - tau photo - oval observed by the comoving observer , and then calculated the comoving radiation field and the eddington factor .",
    "we thus have shown that the eddington factor depends on the _ logarithmic velocity gradient _ in the relativistic regime ( [ f ] ) . combining this result with the analytical expression of paper i , we derived a suitable expression for the eddington factor ( [ f_paper3 ] ) , valid in both the non - relativistic and fully relativistic regimes .    in order to treat the problem in the simplest form , we only considered the optically thick regime , where the one - tau photo - oval always exists . in the optically thin regime or for large velocity gradients ,",
    "a photo - vessel may form , where the optical depth becomes less than unity in the downstream direction . furthermore , in order to isolate the effect of redshift , we have assumed that the radiative intensity emitted from the one - tau photo - oval surface is constant . in the optically thin regime or in the extremely relativistic regime ,",
    "the comoving intensity would be a quickly varing function of the optical depth .",
    "this would affect the behavior of the eddington factor ( cf .",
    "fukue 2006 ; koizumi & umemura 2008 ) .",
    "we will examine these general cases in the future .    under the present plane - parallel case",
    ", the velocity increment in the downstream direction causes the density to decrease in the same direction ; this effect is essential for the shape of the one - tau photo - oval and vessel . in the spherical flow , on the other hand , there exists a geometrical dilution effect , and the situation can be somewhat different , as @xmath83 terms appear ( e.g. , peraiah 2002 ) .",
    "the present approach , however , can be extended to treat also the spherical case and we will examine it in future work .",
    "the treatment of the relativistic eddington factor presented in this paper may turn out to be applicable in various aspects of relativistic astrophysics with radiation transfer ; i.e. , black - hole accretion flows with supercritical accretion rates , relativistic jets and winds driven by luminous central objects , relativistic explosions including gamma - ray bursts , neutrino transfers in supernova explosions , and various events occured in the proto universe .",
    "for example , optically thick , spherically symmetric accretion flows onto black holes were examined ( e.g. , tamazawa et al .",
    "1975 ; begelman 1978 ; vitello 1978 ; burger & katz 1980 ; flammang 1982 ; park & miller 1991 ; nobili et al .",
    "1991 ) , while spherically symmetric , relativistic radiation hydrodynamical winds have investigated by several researchers ( e.g. , castor 1972 ; ruggles & bath 1979 ; mihalas 1980 ; quinn & paczyski 1985 ; paczyski 1986 ; turolla et al . 1986",
    "; paczyski 1990 ; nobili et al .",
    "1994 ; akizuki & fukue 2008 ) .",
    "optically thick , supercritical accretion flow was also extensively studied under the one - zone steady approximation ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1988 ; szuszkiewicz et al .",
    "1996 ; beloborodov 1988 ) .",
    "these models have been applied to neutron - star winds and gamma - ray bursts , or black - hole accretion flows . as a closure relation , in some of these studies ( e.g , quinn & paczyski 1985 ; paczyski 1986 , 1990 ) , the diffusion approximation in the comoving frame and lte was assumed .",
    "however , the diffusion approximation may violate in the extreme relativistic limit with large velocity gradients . in some cases ( e.g. , tamazawa et al .",
    "1975 ; turolla et al . 1986 ; park & miller 1991 ; nobili et al .",
    "1994 ) , the variable eddington factor was used .",
    "however , the adopted eddington factor did only depend on the optical depth , but did not depend on the velocity gradient .    for the problem of of the black - hole accretion flows and winds in the supercritical accretion regime ,",
    "radiation hydrodynamical equations were solved numerically ( e.g. , eggum et al .",
    "1985 , 1988 ; kley 1989 ; okuda et al .",
    "1997 ; kley & lin 1999 ; okuda & fujita 2000 ; okuda 2002 ; okuda et al . 2005 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2005 ; ohsuga 2006 ) .",
    "these models have been applied to relativistic astrophysical jets and winds . in these studies , however , simple assumptions have been made for the treatment of the radiation field ; e.g. , equilibrium between gas and radiation was assumed , the flux - limited diffusion approximation was adopted , the flow velocity was on the order of @xmath84 , or the optically thick to thin transition was not properly treated . up to now , in relation to accretion - disk winds ,",
    "no one solved the fully relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equations .",
    "the treatment of the relativistic eddington factor presented in this paper will help in investigating these types of astrophysical problems that involve the solution of the fully relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equations .",
