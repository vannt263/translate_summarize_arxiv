    "the mechanosensitive channel ( mscl ) is a compelling example of the interaction between a protein and the surrounding bilayer membrane .",
    "the channel is gated mechanically by applied tension and is believed to function as an emergency relief valve in bacteria @xcite .",
    "mscl is a member of a growing class of proteins which have been determined to be mechanosensitive @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the conductance on applied tension has been studied extensively in patch clamp experiments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in terms of the observed conductance",
    ", these studies have revealed that the channel is very nearly a two state system .",
    "mscl spends the vast majority of its life in either a closed state ( c ) or an open state ( o ) characterized by a discrete conductance .",
    "when the bilayer tension is small , the protein is exclusively in the closed configuration .",
    "as the tension grows , the open state becomes ever more prevalent , until it dominates at high tension .",
    "the simplest structural interpretation of this conductance data is to assume that each discrete conductance corresponds to a well defined channel conformation .",
    "this assumption seems to be compatible with the conductance data .",
    "patch clamp experiments have also revealed that there are at least three additional discrete , intermediate conductance levels @xcite suggesting three additional short lived substates ( s1-s3 ) .",
    "rees and coworkers @xcite have solved the structure for one conformation using x - ray crystallography .",
    "this state appears to be the closed state @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite have trapped mscl in the open configuration and used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy ( epr ) and site - directed spin labeling ( sdsl ) to deduce its geometry .",
    "_ @xcite have also proposed an open state conformation based on structural considerations .",
    "the conformational landscape of the mscl channel is extremely complex , depending on huge number of microscopic degrees of freedom which are analytically intractable .",
    "even from the standpoint of numerical calculations , this number is still very large @xcite . as an alternative to a detailed microscopic picture of mscl , we consider a simplified free energy function where we divide the free energy of the system into two contributions , namely , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free energy associated with the conformation of the protein and @xmath4 is the deformation free energy from the bulk of the bilayer @xcite . in general , these two terms are coupled .",
    "the conformation of the protein depends on the forces applied by the bilayer .",
    "the bilayer deformation is induced by the external geometry of the protein .",
    "we denote this external geometry with a state vector , @xmath5 , which captures the radius of the channel as well as its orientation relative to the surrounding bilayer as described in more detail below .",
    "we calculate the induced bilayer deformation energy , @xmath6 , by minimizing the free energy of the bilayer and solving the resulting boundary value problem using an analytic model developed for the study of bilayer mechanics @xcite and protein - bilayer interactions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we then apply asymptotic approximations to the exact solutions of this model for cylindrically symmetric inclusions , permitting all of the results to be expressed , estimated , and understood with simple scaling relations .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it permits us to characterize the protein - bilayer system in a way that is at once analytically tractable and predictive . by understanding the consequences of the simplest models ,",
    "we develop a framework in which to understand the richer dynamics of the real system .",
    "there is a wealth of useful , physical intuition to be gleaned from this model relating to both the function of mscl and that of mechanosensitive transmembrane proteins more generally . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will show that the mechanics of the bilayer must play an integral role in mechanotransduction and channel function .",
    "specifically , we will present detailed analytic estimates of the free energy generated by bilayer deformation induced by the channel and show that these free energies are of the same order as the free energy differences measured by sukharev _",
    "these analytic calculations reveal a compelling and intuitive model for the gating of the mscl channel which is the subject of this current paper .",
    "the competition between hydrophobic mismatch and applied tension , in the presence of radial constraints , generates a bistable system that is implicitly a mechanosensitive channel .",
    "furthermore , this simple model provides a picture which is both qualitatively and quantitatively consonant with the measured dependence of the free energy on acyl chain length as observed by perozo _",
    "in addition , these results may also explain the stabilization of the open state by spontaneous curvature inducing lysophospholipids observed by perozo _",
    "@xcite , although more experiments are required to check the consistency of this proposal .",
    "in the calculations considered here , the geometry of the protein , characterized by the conformational state vector @xmath5 , is described by three geometrical parameters @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius of the channel , @xmath9 is the hydrophobic thickness , and @xmath10 is the mid - plane slope . see figure [ basic ] for details .",
    "[ elb ] although we have parameterized the conformation space of the protein with these three parameters , in this paper , we will focus on the radial dependence alone , claiming that even in this reduced description , the model provides a rich variety of predictions which are compatible with previous observation and suggest new experiments .",
    "the radial dependence of the bilayer deformation energy is particularly important for mscl since the radius undergoes a very large change between the open and closed states @xcite .",
    "the bilayer deformation energy can be written explicitly in terms of the channel radius as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not explicitly depend on @xmath8 and @xmath14 is the applied tension which triggers channel gating .",
    "@xmath12 is a radially independent contribution to the deformation energy which is a function of the other geometrical parameters of the protein .",
    "its importance in gating the channel is most likely secondary since it is independent of @xmath8 and it will be ignored in the remainder of the discussion .",
    "the dependence of bilayer deformation energy on applied tension can be explained intuitively @xcite .",
    "the free energy contribution for a small change in the channel area due to the applied tension can be written @xmath15 which is the two dimensional analogue of the @xmath16 term for a gas in three dimensions .",
    "at high enough applied tension , the state with the largest inclusion area will have the lowest free energy .",
    "the line tension , @xmath13 , contributes an energy proportional to the circumference .",
    "line tensions arise very naturally since the interface area of the inclusion is proportional to the circumference . in",
    "what follows , we will discuss the two dominant contributions to this line tension : thickness deformation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and spontaneous curvature @xcite .",
    "the thickness deformation free energy is induced by the mismatch between the the equilibrium thickness of the bilayer and the hydrophobic thickness of the protein .",
    "the importance of this hydrophobic mismatch in the function of transmembrane proteins has already been established @xcite .",
    "the bilayer deforms locally to reduce the mismatch with the protein as shown in figure  [ basic ] .",
    "symbolically the thickness deformation energy is @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an effective elastic modulus defined in the appendix which is roughly independent of acyl chain length and @xmath19 is half the hydrophobic mismatch as defined in figure [ basic ] . naturally the energetic penalty for this deformation is proportional to the mismatch squared since the minimum energy state corresponds to zero mismatch .",
    "the area of that part of the bilayer which is deformed is roughly equal to the circumference of the channel times an elastic decay length . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of thickness deformation to the total free energy budget scales with the radial dimension of the channel .",
    "we also note that the thickness deformation free energy is always positive .",
    "in contrast , the free energy induced by spontaneous curvature can be either negative or positive .",
    "physically , this free energy comes from locally relieving or increasing the curvature stress generated by lipids or surfactants which induce spontaneous curvature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "again the radial dependence of this free energy will be linear since the effect is localized around the interface .",
    "since the leaflets of the bilayer can be doped independently @xcite , the spontaneous curvatures of the top and bottom leaflets , @xmath20 , can be different .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of the composite spontaneous curvature of the bilayer , @xmath21 .",
    "the contribution to the deformation energy arising from spontaneous curvature is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath10 is the mid - plane slope and @xmath23 , is the bending modulus which roughly scales as the third power of the bilayer thickness .",
    "we will discuss these results in more detail elsewhere .",
    "notice that if @xmath24 and @xmath10 have opposite signs , the deformation energy and the corresponding line tension , @xmath25 , will be negative .",
    "we note that the elastic theory of membrane deformations associated with proteins like mscl permit other terms ( such as mid - plane deformation , for example ) which can be treated within the same framework and which give rise to the same radial dependence as that described here .",
    "however , for the purposes of characterizing the energetics of mscl , these other terms are less important than the two considered here .    typically , in the absence of large spontaneous curvature , the line tension , @xmath13 , will be dominated by the mismatch and will be positive",
    ". a potential of the form described by equation [ bde ] is depicted schematically in figure [ fmr ] . in this figure , we have implied that there are steric constraints for the range of radii accessible to the protein .",
    "assuming that there is a lower bound on the radius of the inclusion is very natural .",
    "it can be understood as the radius below which the residues begin to overlap .",
    "this steric constraint will generate a hard wall in the protein conformation energy , forbidding lower radii .",
    "similar but slightly more elaborate arguments can made for an upper bound .",
    "the bilayer deformation energy generates a barrier between small radius and large radius states .",
    "the location of the peak of this barrier is the turning point @xmath26 at small tension , the turning point is very large and is irrelevant since it occurs at a radius not attainable by the channel due to the steric constraints , but as the tension increases the position of the turning point decreases .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the competition between surface tension and energy density for nucleation processes which give rise to a similar barrier ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "[ defforce ] although the conformational landscape of the mscl channel is certainly very complicated , there is an intriguing possibility that the channel harnesses the elastic properties of the bilayer which quite naturally provide the properties we desire in a mechanosensitive channel : a stable closed state at low tension and a stable open state at high tension . in effect",
    ", we will treat the bilayer deformation energy as an external potential with respect to the conformational energy landscape of the protein .",
    "the physical effects of the radial dependence of the bilayer deformation energy on the inclusion conformation can be recast in a more intuitive form by appealing to the induced tension which accounts not only for the applied far field tension , but also for _ induced _ tension terms due to bilayer deformation .",
    "the applied tension is not the whole story ! the generalized forces are obtained by differentiating the bilayer deformation energy with respect to bilayer excursions .",
    "the net tension induced by the bilayer on the inclusion interface is @xmath27 where we have denoted the net tension @xmath28 since we have already used @xmath14 to denote the applied tension . for radii smaller than the turning point , @xmath29 , the bilayer deformation energy is an increasing function of radius and therefore the net tension is negative and acts to compress the channel . for radii larger than that at the turning point ,",
    "the bilayer deformation energy is a decreasing function of radius and the net tension is positive and acts to expand the channel .",
    "the combination of these constraints and the bilayer deformation energy lead to a bistable system where the closed and open states correspond to the constraint - induced radial minimum and maximum , respectively . recall that the net tension on the closed state will be compressive as long as its radius is smaller than that at the turning point , namely , @xmath30 this inequality defines the range of applied tension over which the closed state is stabilized by the bilayer deformation energy .",
    "the net tension on the open state will be expansive as long as its radius is greater than that at the turning point : @xmath31 this inequality defines the range of applied tension over which the open state is stabilized by the bilayer deformation energy .",
    "there is an intermediate range of tensions for which both states are stabilized by the bilayer , @xmath32 the bilayer deformation energy naturally destabilizes the open state for applied tension below this range while stabilizing the closed state for applied tensions up to the limit of this range . both effects help to prevent the channel from leaking at",
    "low applied tension .",
    "this bistability is precisely the desirable behavior for a mechanosensitive channel designed to relieve internal pressure and yet surprisingly little is required from the protein conformational landscape , @xmath33 , except for steric constraints which arise very naturally . in figure",
    "[ mech ] , we have depicted a mechanical analogue of this bistable system . in figure",
    "[ fmr2 ] , we have depicted the way in which mscl mimics this mechanical analogue by using the sum of a schematic protein energy and the bilayer deformation energy to form energy minima corresponding to the open and closed states .",
    "our general discussion of the role of the bilayer enables us to make some rather general observations about the nature of the substates . in order to generate a substate",
    ", we assume that there is more than one gating transition in the protein conformational energy .",
    "one gating transition would correspond to a closed to open transition .",
    "an additional gating transition allows three conductance states .",
    "we will assume that these transitions are themselves bistable in nature since the conductance data would seem to imply the lifetimes of the transition states are very short compared to the conductance states @xcite .",
    "in other words , the conformational gating transition occurs near a local maximum in the conformational free energy like that depicted in figure [ mech ] .",
    "if we add two such transitions to @xmath33 , we generate a substate of intermediate radius between these two transition state radii .",
    "a schematic example of this is illustrated in figure [ fmr2 ] .",
    "@xcite have shown that all the substates are short lived and have estimated the areas of each state based on the tension dependence of their free energies .",
    "specifically , they have shown that the radii of the substates lie between the open and closed state radii .",
    "if the bilayer deformation dominates the free energy of the states , the ephemeral nature of the substates is a natural consequence of their intermediate radii .",
    "the compressive tension due to the mismatch stabilizes the state of lowest radius at low applied tension . at",
    "high applied tension the bilayer stabilizes the state with highest radius .",
    "all the states with intermediate radii are never stabilized by the bilayer and are therefore short lived .",
    "our deceptively simple mismatch model quite naturally leads to short lived substates at intermediate radii .    in this section",
    "we have shown that some very general assumptions about the form of the bilayer deformation energy lead to channel behavior which is mechanosensitive .",
    "although we have suggested a specific source , thickness deformation , for the line tension , @xmath13 , this linear radial dependence arises very naturally .",
    "for instance , if we assume the bilayer is too stiff to deform and the mismatch causes hydrophobic residues to come into contact with the solvent , a larger positive line tension would be induced .",
    "the competition between line tension and applied tension is therefore a quite general phenomena for mechanosensitive transmembrane proteins .",
    "we shall demonstrate below that , for mscl , this mechanism appears to explain the free energy dependence on bilayer acyl chain length surprisingly well .",
    "the patch clamp experiments of perozo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite go beyond the earlier work of sukharev _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite by providing experimental values for the free energy difference between the open and closed states for bilayers of several thicknesses .",
    "these results can be compared with our predictions . in order to apply our model",
    ", we must determine the geometrical parameters of the state vector @xmath5 for the open and closed states and in particular the open and closed radii .",
    "the radius of the closed state is known from x - ray crystallography @xcite : @xmath34 .",
    "structural studies @xcite and epr and sdsl @xcite experiments have suggested an open state radius of roughly @xmath35 . in order to estimate the line tension and free energy generated by hydrophobic mismatch",
    ", we must determine the hydrophobic thickness @xmath9 .",
    "( we ignore the difference in hydrophobic thickness between the open and closed states . ) in principle , one might have thought this could be deduced from the atomic - level structure of mscl , but in practice , real structures are complicated , often lacking a clear transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic residues on the interface .",
    "however , this width may be deduced from the epr and sdsl data of perozo _ et al .",
    "epr and sdsl experiments measure inter - subunit proximity and spin - label mobility , respectively @xcite .",
    "compressive tension in the bilayer suppresses the fluctuations of the protein , increasing the subunit proximity and reducing the spin label mobility . in the experiments of perozo _",
    "@xcite , the applied tension is low implying that the net tension is dominated by the line tension , induced by thickness deformation , @xmath36 in the absence of spontaneous curvature .",
    "this tension is compressive and proportional to the mismatch squared .",
    "therefore , when the mismatch is zero , the tension reaches a minimum , implying that mobility and subunit separation should reach a maximum .",
    "the epr and sdsl data of perozo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite may turn over for pc12 bilayers , implying that the mismatch is zero which would imply in turn that @xmath37 but due to the quadratic dependence on @xmath19 , the slope in the vicinity of the turnover is small . since pc lipids with acyl chain length shorter than @xmath38 do not form stable bilayers @xcite , it is difficult to extensively check the quadratic dependence on @xmath19 . the predicted turnover would be more pronounced for pc bilayers with @xmath39 .",
    "we shall see that this deduced hydrophobic mismatch is compatible with the patch clamp measurements of perozo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "perozo _ et al .",

    "the theoretical result , @xmath41 , is plotted with the experimental measurements of @xmath40 in fig [ res ] .",

    "_ @xcite have measured three data points and our model is quadratic , implying that we could have chosen the parameters of our model to fit the data points perfectly since any three points lie on a parabola , but our parameters have in fact been deduced independently rather than fit , which is why this correspondence with the data is remarkable .",
    "this model corresponds to a channel where the free energy difference between the open and closed states is dominated by the bilayer deformation rather than protein conformation .",
    "our model implies that @xmath40 for pc10 , pc12 , and pc14 should be very small .",
    "unfortunately these bilayers have proved too weak for patch - clamp measurements of @xmath40 @xcite . certainly none of these bilayers trap the channel in the open state @xcite .",
    "the opening tension is defined as the tension at which the open and closed state probabilities are equal or , analogously , the tension at which the free energies of the open and closed states are equal .",
    "the opening tension is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mean radius , @xmath46 is the difference in the open and closed state protein conformation energy , and @xmath47 is the difference in open and closed state area . when the bilayer deformation energy dominates , the opening tension is determined by the first term alone . changing the sensitivity of the channel is straightforward from this perspective .",
    "changes in the length of the hydrophobic region of the protein can increase or decrease the opening tension of the channel .",
    "for example , mscl channels might be engineered with an expanded hydrophobic region which matches pc14 bilayers .",
    "our mismatch based theory would predict that the free energy versus acyl chain length curve would simply be translated to higher @xmath48 so that the minimum @xmath41 is realized for a pc14 bilayer .",
    "this shift should be measurable , reducing @xmath40 for pc16 , pc18 , and pc20 bilayers .",
    "the reduction in mismatch may also allow mscl to be reconstituted into pc22 bilayers , allowing an additional data point .",
    "the proposed shift should also be measurable in epr and sdsl measurements of residue proximity and mobility .",
    "the maximum mobility and separation should now be centered around @xmath49 , perhaps permitting a clear measurement of the rise in induced tension for a pc10 bilayer predicted by the quadratic dependence of the line tension on the mismatch .",

    "we now return to this picture briefly to discuss the consequences of spontaneous curvature . in our discussion",
    ", we assumed that the line tension , @xmath13 , was typically positive , but we remarked that this need not be the case in the presence of large spontaneous curvature . if @xmath13 is negative , as depicted by the dotted curve in figure [ fmr ] , the only state stabilized by the bilayer is the open state , which very naturally gives rise to the open state stabilization observed by perozo _",
    "_ @xcite . alternatively",
    ", this result can be understood from the predicted opening tension in equation [ opening_tension ] .",
    "when @xmath40 is bilayer deformation dominated , a negative @xmath13 implies that the opening tension is itself negative ! a compressive force is required to stabilize the closed state .",
    "this argument gives a tantalizingly simple explanation for the open state stabilization but in the absence of measured values for the spontaneous curvature induced by lpc , we can only conclude that spontaneous curvature could stabilize the open states for rather generic values of the parameters .",
    "an experimental consistency check of these results is fairly simple .",

    "the same experiment might be repeated with @xmath51 phase inducing lipids which can also be used to generate spontaneous curvature but of the opposite sign . for the dopc / dope system of keller _ et al . _",

    "although we have not discussed transition states in detail , the proposed model also predicts that the transition rates between states depends on the line tension , @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume the transition rates to be given by the standard arrhenius form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the free energy barrier height for the transition and @xmath54 is roughly constant , the results can be understood intuitively by consulting figure [ fmr2 ] . at fixed tension ,",
    "forward transition rates ( transitions to increasing radii ) are reduced by line tension while backward rates are increased . at any fixed tension",
    ", we would therefore expect the forward rates for mscl reconstituted into a pc16 bilayer to be faster than for a pc18 bilayer while the backward rates are slower since the pc18 bilayer has a greater line tension .",

    "can not be neglected in general .",
    "in fact , we have assumed that the protein conformational energy is large enough to constrain the channel geometry since we have assumed it is the bilayer which deforms rather than the protein . in principle , the closed state could have been stabilized by protein conformation alone , rather than mismatch , but exploiting bilayer deformation provides a robust mechanism for mechanotransduction , a design principle which functions in spite of the enormous number of nearly degenerate microstates endemic to proteins . even for proteins as simple as myoglobin , frauenfelder _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the macroscopic conformation corresponds to an enormous number of structurally distinct microstates .",

    "the importance of bilayer deformation in mechanotransduction may help to explain why there are no obvious sequence motifs associated with mechanosensitivity @xcite since a mismatch requirement does not imply sequence specificity . harnessing bilayer elasticity",
    "does have one noted disadvantage .",
    "the gating of a channel will be affected by the membrane environment which surrounds it .",
    "this is precisely what the experiments of perozo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown .",
    "in realistic cell membranes there is an enormous diversity of proteins and lipids which would imply that the free energy , and therefore opening tension , in these membranes would be heterogeneous .",
    "sukharev and co workers @xcite have evidence for exactly this variability for mscl in giant spheroplasts .",
    "the correspondence between our simple theoretical model for the gating of the mscl channel and experiment is at least strongly suggestive that this mechanism is exploited by the mscl channel .",
    "our model can also naturally explain the stabilization of the open state by lpc @xcite as well as the ephemeral nature of the substates @xcite .",
    "the tractable nature and simplicity of the model allow extensive analytic calculations to be made , which have in turn lead to numerous experimental predictions , discussed in section [ mscl_g ] .",
    "specifically we have predicted ( i ) a shift in the curve relating the free energy difference and acyl chain length when the hydrophobic thickness of the channel is altered , ( ii ) the dependence of the free energy on spontaneous curvature and , in particular , on the concentration of spontaneous curvature - inducing molecules , and ( iii ) the qualitative dependence of the transition rates on acyl chain length and spontaneous curvature .",
    "we have developed an extensive framework for studying bilayer - inclusion interactions in the mscl system .",
    "the model we have discussed here is the simplest implementation of these results and a more thorough description of the model will appear in a future paper .",
    "there are several very natural extensions to the current work .",
    "for example , we have focused here on the radial dependence only , but , as we have briefly alluded to in section [ caveats ] , there are two additional geometric parameters which may also play important roles in the function of the mscl channel .",
    "more detailed measurements of the rates and free energies of the various states will no doubt prove our simplified model incomplete and provide motivation and insight into a more detailed model of channel gating .",
    "the simplicity and generality of the competition between applied tension and line tension suggests that it may be a quite general phenomena for mechanotransduction .",
    "we hope to apply similar ideas to other mechanosensitive systems .",
    "more generally , we are also intrigued by the possibility of finding analogous bilayer deformation driven conformational changes for other transmembrane proteins which do not exhibit mechanosensitive function , perhaps illuminating a more general qualitative design principle for the function of transmembrane proteins .",
