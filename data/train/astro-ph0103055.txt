    "the origin of most of the x  ray emission in the universe is still unknown because the sources that produce most of the @xmath4 2 kev x ",
    "ray background ( xrb ) are still to be resolved .",
    "_ rosat _  surveys have succeeded in resolving @xmath5 of the 1 - 2 kev xrb into individual sources ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) , and optical identification and x  ray spectroscopy has been possible for brighter sources which produce @xmath6 of the 1 - 2 kev background .",
    "the majority of these sources are broad line agn ( hereafter blagn ) , and at faint fluxes narrow emission line galaxies ( hereafter nelgs , mchardy et al .",
    "1998 ) ; schmidt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that the nelgs are also agn , but with low luminosity or obscured broad line regions . on average ,",
    "faint nelgs have harder x  ray spectra ( @xmath7 with @xmath8 , romero - colmenero et al .",
    "1996 , almaini et al .",
    "1996 ) than the broad line agn which have mean @xmath9 ( mittaz et al . 1999 ,",
    "ciliegi et al . 1994 ) .",
    "despite the success of _ rosat _  surveys , the xrb can not be synthesised by extrapolating the observed source populations to faint fluxes , because the resultant spectrum would be softer than that of the background ; this discrepancy is present for all energy bands between 0.5 and 40 kev .",
    "this means that at faint fluxes there must be a population of sources with spectra that are harder than the background .",
    "according to leading models , these hard sources ( eg fabian 1999 , gilli , risaliti & salvati 1999 ) are obscured agn .",
    "however , the physical nature and observational appearance of the xrb producing population is not yet known , and is the subject of some debate .",
    "for example , gilli , risaliti & salvati ( 1999 ) examined a model intended to reproduce the xrb by extrapolating the x  ray emission of present epoch agn to high redshift using the observed soft x  ray luminosity function .",
    "in contrast , the model of fabian ( 1999 ) has a large fraction of the xrb due to a population of high redshift , heavily obscured , growing agn , which are different to anything observed in the local universe .    in page",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , hereafter paper 1 , we presented a catalogue of 147 serendipitous _ rosat _",
    "sources which have spectra harder than that of the xrb .",
    "these sources have a steep @xmath10 relation down to the sensitivity limit of our survey ( @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 ) , and are therefore likely to be the bright tail of the population of hard sources that dominate the source counts at faint fluxes . as such",
    ", they could offer us a preview of the faint , hard and dominant , x - ray source population .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a programme of optical and infrared observations of our _ rosat _  hard source sample to find out what these sources are . in this paper",
    "we present the hard source identifications obtained from our optical ( spectroscopic ) campaign together with those found in existing catalogues .",
    "section [ sec : method ] details our method and observations , the results of which are given in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "these results are discussed in the context of absorbed agn and the xrb in section [ sec : discussion ] . finally",

    "we define power law spectral index @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "to produce a systematic and efficient optical identification programme , we divided the hard x - ray sources into two groups depending on the ease of optical identification .",
    "sources which had one or two plausible candidates present in apm data and/or the dss were considered suitable for optical spectroscopy and make up the ` spectroscopic sample ' , while sources with no plausible candidates , or more than two , were considered unsuitable for spectroscopy and became the ` imaging sample ' .",
    "there are 103 sources in the spectroscopic sample and 44 sources in the imaging sample .",
    "this paper will deal only with identified sources from the spectroscopic sample ( except for two sources , rxj005812.20 - 274217.8 and rxj101112.05 + 554451.3 , which are fainter than our spectroscopic sample limit but have catalogue identifications ) .",
    "the properties of sources in the imaging sample , and their relationship to the spectroscopic sample sources , will be discussed briefly in section [ sec : imaging ] and in more detail in carrera et al .",
    "( in preparation ) where we will present the results of our optical and infrared imaging .",
    "the three sources of data for the identification process were spectra taken on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the european southern observatory 3.6 m telescope ( eso 3.6 ) , and databases of existing catalogues .",
    "the optical spectra will be presented in mittaz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) along with a full description of the observations and data reduction .",
    "catalogue identifications were obtained by searching the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) and simbad around all the _ rosat _  hard source positions ( not just the spectroscopic sample ) .",
    "one further source ( rxj043420.48 - 082136.7 ) was identified from a wht isis spectrum taken during the rixos programme , but was not part of the final rixos sample presented in mason et al .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]      the fitted x - ray spectral slopes and fluxes of the different types of sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specflux ] , and their mean slopes and fluxes are given in table [ tab : numbers ] .",
    "a noticeable feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : specflux ] is that the clusters of galaxies are concentrated towards the top right ( soft spectrum , high flux ) corner compared to the other sources .",
    "this trend is confirmed by a two dimensional kolmogorov smirnov ( 2dks ) test ( fasano & franceschini 1987 ) : the cluster distribution of ( @xmath16 ) is different to that for any ( or all ) of the other source types with @xmath17 confidence . because they are not particularly hard , and because they are predominantly bright and therefore do not have as steep an @xmath10 relation as the rest of the hard sources , the clusters are unlikely to be important contributors to the faint hard source population .    note that the very hard mean spectral index of the galactic stars ( see table [ tab : numbers ] ) is due to the three objects with best fit @xmath18 , two of which ( rxj112056.87 + 132726.2 with best fit @xmath19 and rxj133146.37 + 111420.4 with best fit @xmath20 ) are unlikely to be correct identifications ( see section [ sec : notes ] ) .",
    "the other three types of sources ( blagn , nelgs and galaxies ) have distributions of ( @xmath16 ) which are indistinguishable from one another according to the 2dks test ; any ( or all ) could be significant contributors to the faint , hard population .    for comparison figure [ fig : specflux ] also shows the unidentified sources .",
    "unidentified objects in the spectroscopic sample are found with similar spectral slopes and fluxes to the identified sources ( except the clusters which are softer and brighter ) .",
    "the sources in the imaging sample are more concentrated toward faint fluxes and comprise most of the faintest ( @xmath21 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 ) hard sources .",
    "we now consider briefly how fair a subsample the identified sources are of the whole _ rosat _",
    "hard source sample .",
    "starting with the spectroscopic sample , candidates were chosen for identification on our wht and eso 3.6 m observing runs without regard to their optical magnitudes and morphologies , ( except to exclude sources with an existing catalogue identification ) and are hence an unbiased subsample of the spectroscopic sample . the catalogue identifications , although including a few optically bright galaxies , are mostly from previous flux limited x  ray surveys .",
    "they therefore tend to have higher x  ray fluxes than the spectroscopic sample as a whole , but are otherwise a fair subsample .",
    "this means that except for a bias towards higher x  ray fluxes , the identified sources are a fair subsample of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the spectroscopic sample is a significant fraction of the whole _",
    "rosat_hard source sample ( 103 of 147 sources ) , but it can not be considered a fair subsample because it excludes the optically faint sources which form the imaging sample . without spectroscopically identifying the imaging sample",
    "( which is currently impractical ) it is not possible to determine whether or not the imaging sample is _ actually _ made up of the same mix of sources as the spectroscopic sample",
    ". however we can examine whether it is _ possible _ , by assuming that similar types of sources will have similar x ",
    "ray to optical flux ratios .",
    "figure [ fig : optx ] shows the x  ray flux against the apm red ( e or r ) magnitude for the identified sources with available apm data .",
    "blagn , nelgs and galaxies are found with similar ranges of x  ray to optical ratio .",
    "the optical counterparts to the imaging sample sources are presumed to be fainter than the plate limit , which we take to be 20.5 and 21.0 for sources with apm data available for e and r plates respectively .",
    "the imaging sample sources are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : optx ] with these lower limits except for two sources rxj031956.76 - 663938.5 and rxj101031.05 + 503458.6 , which are in the imaging sample because there are too many potential counterparts for practical spectroscopic follow up .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to an x  ray to optical flux ratio which is similar to that of rxj111750.51 + 075712.8 , which has the highest x  ray to optical flux ratio of the identified spectroscopic sample sources excluding the clusters .",
    "only six of the imaging sample sources lie above the dashed line , and therefore definitely have x  ray to optical flux ratios different to those of the identified sources .",
    "therefore the limits on the optical to x  ray ratios are consistent with the identified sources being the same types of objects as constitute almost the whole _ rosat _  hard source sample .      fig .",
    "[ fig : zlumi ] shows the redshifts and 0.5 - 2 kev luminosities for the extragalactic hard sources .",
    "luminosities were calculated from the fitted fluxes , k corrected using the best fit spectral slopes , and assuming @xmath22 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the majority of the blagn have higher luminosities and redshifts than the nelgs and galaxies ; all the high redshift ( @xmath3 ) sources are blagn .",
    "this may imply that either hard spectrum narrow line sources do not exist at high luminosity / redshift or our spectroscopic sample is not deep enough ( in x  ray or optical flux ) to find them .",
    "it is common to parameterise the x  ray to optical and optical to radio flux ratios of agn as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the slope of the power law which ( in the object s rest frame ) would connect the flux density ( f@xmath27 ) at 2500   with the x  ray flux density at 2 kev , and @xmath26 is the slope of the power law which would connect the flux density at 2500   with the flux density at 5 ghz .    for all sources we have estimated the rest frame 2500   flux density using b photometry ( taken from carrera et al . in preparation ) and assuming a power law optical - uv spectrum with slope @xmath28 , and using the b magnitude to flux conversion given by wilkes et al .",
    "the b magnitudes have been corrected for galactic reddening using the expression for @xmath29 in bohlin , savage & drake ( 1978 ) and assuming @xmath30 .    to estimate the rest frame 5 ghz fluxes we have searched for potential radio counterparts to our x  ray sources in the catalogues of radio sources in the vla 1.4 ghz first ( white et al . 1997 ) and nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) surveys and the 5 ghz parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn , griffith & wright 1993 ) survey . additionally , radio images from these surveys were searched by eye to ensure that any extended radio sources associated with our x  ray sources were not missed , and to ensure that there were no spurious radio counterparts associated with other extended radio sources .",
    "the uncertainty in radio source position from these three surveys ranges from @xmath31 better than 1 arcsecond ( first ) to around 10 arcseconds ( pmn ) .",
    "the sky density of radio sources is sufficiently low ( reaching around 100 deg@xmath32 at the @xmath311 mjy completeness limit of first ) that it is unlikely that there are any chance coincidences . where no suitable radio source appears in a survey catalogue , we have taken the catalogue completeness limit as the upper limit to the radio flux of the x  ray source .",
    "we took the best measurement ( or upper limit ) available from the three surveys and assume a radio spectral slope of @xmath33 .",
    "the 2 kev flux density has been estimated from the fitted 0.5 - 2 kev fluxes and assuming an x  ray spectral slope of @xmath34 .",

    "[ fig : alphaoxr ] for all the hard sources identified as blagn , nelgs and galaxies .",
    "the horizontal dashed line marks @xmath37 which is commonly used to differentiate radio loud and radio quiet objects ( zamorani et al .",
    "seven hard sources ( four blagn , 2 galaxies and 1 nelg ) lie above this line , and are therefore radio loud .",
    "this is a large radio loud fraction ( 15@xmath38% where errors are the poission 68% confidence interval , gehrels 1986 ) of the blagn , nelgs and galaxies compared to the fraction found in normal _ rosat _  surveys _ without _ spectral selection , eg cilliegi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that only two of the eighty crss agn and nelgs ( 2.5@xmath39% ) are radio loud . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath25 of the hard sources is quite similar to that found in other agn surveys ( eg ciliegi et al .",
    "1995 , wilkes et al .",
    "1994 ) , with the majority of sources having @xmath40 .      the leading hypothesis to explain the majority of faint hard sources which contribute substantially to the xrb is that they are intrinsically absorbed agn ( eg fabian & iwasawa 1999 , setti & woltjer 1989 ) .",
    "this is also a likely hypothesis for our hard sources , because the optical spectra and colours of a significant fraction of our blagn and nelgs suggest absorption ( mittaz et al .",
    "2001 and carrera et al .",
    "assuming that our blagn , nelgs and galaxies have hard spectra because of absorption , we have estimated their column densities from their 3 colour _ rosat _  pspc spectra .",
    "we assume that before absorption they have power law x  ray spectra with energy index @xmath41 ( typical for x - ray selected agn , eg mittaz et al . 1999 , maccacaro et al . 1988 ) and fit their intrinsic cold gas column .",
    "the fitting procedure was identical to that described in paper 1 except that the free parameters in the fit are intrinsic column and power law normalisation rather than power law slope and normalisation .",

    "excluding the clusters , which are unlikely to be an important part of the faint , hard x  ray source population ( see section [ sec : slopeflux ] ) , we have identified 3 types of extragalactic hard source : blagn , nelgs and galaxies . at first sight the identification content of",
    "the sample appears similar to that of other pspc surveys with similar flux limits but without any spectral selection , eg blagn being the most numerous source .",
    "however , in two respects the identification content of this survey is significantly different .",
    "the first difference is that there is a higher proportion of radio loud objects ( 15@xmath38% ) in this survey ( see section [ sec : alphaoxr ] ) .",
    "there are two possible reasons why this should be so .",
    "one is that the intrinsic x  ray emission of radio loud sources may be harder than that of radio quiet sources ( reeves et al .",
    "1997 ) because the radio loud sources have an additional , hard spectrum x  ray emission component from the inner parts of radio jets .",
    "the other possibility is that our radio loud sources are absorbed , and because they are intrinsically more x  ray luminous than radio quiet sources they are relatively numerous in a relatively bright survey of hard spectrum sources .",
    "this would be analogous to the high proportion of ( presumably unabsorbed ) radio loud sources present in bright soft x  ray surveys ( eg 11@xmath270% in the emss , della ceca et al",
    ". 1994 ) compared to fainter soft x ",
    "ray surveys ( eg 2.5@xmath39% in the crss , ciliegi et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the second difference is that there are nearly half as many nelgs as blagn ( see table [ tab : ids ] ) compared to ratios of @xmath31 1:13 nelgs to agn in rixos ( mason et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath31 1:6 in the ccrs ( boyle , wilkes & elvis 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that the fraction of sources with hard spectra is larger in the nelg population than in the blagn population .",
    "this is consistent with the findings that the nelgs in faint x ",
    "ray surveys have , on average , harder x  ray spectra than blagn ( romero - colmenero et al .",
    "1996 , almaini et al .",
    "1996 ) , and with the hypothesis that most x  ray selected nelgs are absorbed agn ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 , lehmann et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "hence the hypothesis that most of the sources have hard x  ray spectra because they are absorbed could account for both the high radio loud and nelg content of this survey .",
    "it is also consistent with the preliminary analyses of the optical spectra and optical colours of the hard sources ( mittaz et al .",
    "2001 and carrera et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "related to the absorption hypothesis , an important finding is that the distributions of x  ray spectral slopes and fluxes of the blagn , nelgs and galaxies are indistinguishable within the current sample , but the three groups have different ranges of luminosities .",
    "the galaxies are found at low luminosity while the high luminosity sources are blagn ( see figures [ fig : zlumi ] and [ fig : redcollum ] ) .",
    "the absence of high luminosity , absorbed narrow line agn has also been noted by akiyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the _ asca _  large sky survey .",
    "these results are consistent with all three source types having the same mechanism for their x  ray spectra ( an absorbed active nucleus ) but optical emission line properties which depend on luminosity .",
    "for this reason we point out that the high redshift , high luminosity , absorbed qsos expected to produce a large fraction of the x  ray background are not neccessarily narrow line objects ( the proposed `` qso 2s '' ) like seyfert 2s , their low luminosity counterparts .",
    "we have performed a survey of _ rosat _  fields for serendipitous sources with hard spectra ( @xmath0 ) ; such sources must be a major contributor to the x  ray background at faint fluxes . in this paper",
    "we have presented optical identifications for 62 of these sources .",
    "almost half ( 28 ) of these sources are blagn , while 12 are nelgs and 5 are galaxies without visible emission lines .",
    "we have also found 8 clusters of galaxies among the hard spectrum sources .",
    "however , these are predominantly bright sources and are not particularly hard ( their best fit spectral indices all lie in the range @xmath271 ) , and hence clusters are unlikely to be an important component of the hard , faint population .",
    "the hard spectrum blagn have a distribution of x  ray to optical ratios which is similar to that found for agn from other soft x  ray surveys ( @xmath2 ) . however , a relatively large proportion ( 15% ) of the blagn , nelgs and galaxies are radio loud .",
    "this could be because the radio jets in these objects produce intrinsically hard x  ray emission , or if they are absorbed , it could be because radio loud objects are more x  ray luminous than radio quiet objects .",
    "the blagn , nelgs and galaxies have indistinguishable distributions of x  ray flux and spectra , hence any or all may be important to the hard , faint population required to solve the xrb spectral paradox .",
    "the majority of the galaxies are low luminosity sources , while the highest luminosity objects , and all the high redshift ( @xmath3 ) sources , are blagn .",
    "their _ rosat _  spectra are consistent with their being agn obscured by columns of @xmath1 .",
    "overall , our data are consistent with the x  ray emission of the blagn , nelgs , and the galaxy sources coming from absorbed active nuclei .",
