    "the casimir effect @xcite is an observable attraction between neutral electrical conductors .",
    "its mathematical charm is that , at least for perfect conductors , it can be attributed to and calculated from the geometrical dependence of the energy of the quantized electromagnetic field in the region between the conductors . as often in quantum field theory , naive calculations give an infinite answer .",
    "subtraction of the zero - point energy of each field mode renders the local energy density finite but leaves a nonintegrable singularity at the boundaries .",
    "this divergence , because it can be regarded as permanently attached to the conductors , does not interfere with the calculation of the force of attraction between rigid bodies .",
    "however , a more accurate representation of the physics near the boundary is needed @xcite to understand situations where the boundary can deform , such as the celebrated case of an expandable sphere @xcite",
    ". furthermore , the energy density ( more completely , the stress tensor ) of the field should act as a source of the gravitational field in general relativity , so localized infinities within it are not physically plausible @xcite . for more detailed background information",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is universally agreed among physicists that the root of this problem is that the idealization of a `` perfect conductor '' is inapplicable to very - high - frequency modes of the quantized field .",
    "a full treatment of the physical problem , including modeling of the charged particles inside the conductors , would take us out of the spectral theory of self - adjoint linear partial differential operators into difficult , nonlinear condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "one might hope that an ad hoc cutoff of the contribution of high - frequency modes would preserve the qualitative essence of the physically correct solution , and indeed a simple exponential cutoff leads to both tractable calculations and physically plausible results @xcite , while placing the topic firmly within the study of the asymptotics of integral kernels ( green functions ) associated with the operator concerned , in the grand tradition of spectral and geometrical asymptotics .",
    "( most of the issues of principle in vacuum energy are adequately addressed by studying a scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions instead of an electromagnetic field with perfect - conductor boundary conditions , and our discussion has now lapsed into that setting . )    unfortunately , a close examination of the stress tensor ( in particular , energy density and pressure ) predicted by the theory of @xcite reveals that the expected energy - balance equation ( sometimes called principle of virtual work @xcite ) , @xmath3 describing the change in total energy when a boundary acted upon by pressure  @xmath4 is moved a distance  @xmath5 , is not satisfied @xcite .",
    "the root of this problem appears to be that the degree to which a particular normal mode is affected by the cutoff depends on  @xmath5 , so that derivatives of the cutoff function contaminate fundamental relations like ( [ enbalance ] ) .",
    "the exponential cutoff on frequency amounts , after analytic continuation , to a time - direction separation of the space - time points that are the argument variables of the integral kernel for the wave equation of the problem .",
    "physically plausible results can be achieved for the various tensor components in various scenarios by choosing a specific space - time direction for the point separation in each case , but such an ad hoc procedure can not be regarded as logically satisfactory for the long term .    our present goal is to replace the reflecting boundary and the cutoff with a smooth potential rising to infinity .",
    "the potential can be thought of as a static configuration of another scalar field ( presumably of very high mass ) .",
    "after some well understood renormalizations in the bulk , this model should yield a finite vacuum stress tensor without any cutoff . as an internally consistent physical system without ad hoc modification",
    ", it is expected to satisfy the physically required energy - balance relation . yet in the limit of a very steep wall it should approach in some sense the vacuum stress of the problem with dirichlet boundary . if its predictions resemble those for hard - wall calculations with certain point separations , those ( technically easier ) ad hoc methods will be vindicated and can be used with confidence in other situations .    here we report progress on this problem achieved during the spring semester of 2010 , while j.  wagner held a visiting assistant professorship in mathematics at texas a&m university .",

    "the asymptotic relations ( [ deltasmall ] ) and ( [ deltalarge ] ) give some idea of what an allowed @xmath45 must look like , but otherwise the inverse problem of determining @xmath73 , or even its basic qualitative properties , from a given @xmath45 is wide open , as far as we know .",

    "@xmath88 is , of course , singular on the diagonal ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) and only there .",
    "the singularity makes it impossible to pass to the diagonal directly in ( [ t00fromt ] ) , but that is also unnecessary : @xmath88 is present in all problems , including empty space ( where @xmath92 is naturally defined to be zero ) , and hence is physically meaningless .",
    "one expects to isolate and discard it before implementing ( [ t00fromt ] ) , which is applied only to the `` renormalized '' kernel , @xmath93 .",
    "the latter , as given in ( [ image ] ) , is nonsingular in the region of physical interest ; on diagonal one gets ( with our convention @xmath94 ) @xmath95 and similar formulas ( proportional to @xmath96 ) for the energy density and pressures . in the present case ( [ tcartouter ] )",
    "is applicable over the whole range @xmath97 , and ( [ walltren ] ) gives the expectation value of the scalar field right up to the wall ( where it develops a nonintegrable divergence ) .",
    "this much is totally standard and familiar to all workers in the field of vacuum energy .",
    "however , let us go back to the integral form of ( [ image ] ) contained in ( [ freeren ] ) : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and attempt to set @xmath74 and @xmath100 equal to 0 before evaluating the integral . although @xmath101 is well - defined except when @xmath102 , in ( [ imageint ] ) we appear to have a double disaster : the denominator of the integrand is identically zero , and , moreover , even the integral of the numerator alone diverges because the exponential cutoff is lost .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is that @xmath103 in the sense of distributions , and the dirac distribution @xmath104 is identically @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "thus the classically divergent numerator integral is equal to @xmath105 in the distributional sense in the limit @xmath107 , and ( [ imageint ] ) is consistent with ( [ image ] ) and ( [ walltren ] ) there .",
    "returning to the general case , we are confronted by the integral @xmath108 one might consider evaluating it numerically , given a trustworthy formula or ansatz for @xmath44 .",
    "however , in view of the previous special example , it is not surprising that the integral is poorly convergent when @xmath109 is small , which is precisely where we want it .",
    "in fact , we should be able to take @xmath110 and get a finite answer when @xmath111 , but instead we have the same apparent infinities as in the dirichlet case ; and this time it is not obvious that the integral ( without the factor @xmath112 ) vanishes distributionally to lowest order in @xmath113 when @xmath111 , although that must surely be true .",
    "to compound the problem , it appears that even this weak kind of convergence depends sensitively on @xmath45 .",
    "suppose that instead of ( [ imageint ] ) we had considered @xmath114 which one might naively think to correspond to the large-@xmath9 limit of ( [ deltalarge ] ) ( which actually is invalid for @xmath16 with fixed  @xmath4 ) .",
    "this integral equals @xmath115 thus the cancellation that removes the divergence on the @xmath116 axis in ( [ imageint ] ) does not happen here .",
    "more generally , there is a genuine divergence for @xmath117 unless @xmath118 .",
    "naively one would think that the divergent boundary energy we are studying is contributed by the modes of large  @xmath4 , and that therefore only the leading term in the wkb asymptotics ( [ deltalarge ] ) would be significant ; the current example shows that that is not true .",
    "the fallacy in the reasoning is that high frequency can correspond to large @xmath119 at fixed  @xmath4 , as well as to large  @xmath4 .",
    "the sensitivity of ( [ imageint ] ) to a constant phase shift remains visible in the polar framework treated in the next subsection .",
    "the @xmath120 integral in ( [ tpolar ] ) or ( [ tpolardiag ] ) in that case evaluates to a bessel function @xmath121 , which decays slowly as @xmath122 ; however , the outer integration yields ( [ walltren ] ) by a standard formula found in handbooks and known to _ mathematica_.",
    "but the tiniest phase shift augments the bessel function by a struve function , which approaches a nonzero constant at infinity , so that the integral diverges unambiguously .      therefore , we recast the integration so that all high frequencies are treated on an equal footing .",
    "any true divergence must come from the integral over high frequencies , since the eigenfunctions are smoooth and bounded .",
    "abandoning the key formula ( [ trencart ] ) for now , we return to ( [ tfour ] ) , which in the notations @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , becomes @xmath126 ( note that @xmath127 is the same @xmath113 as before . )",
    "now introduce polar coordinates in the space of variables @xmath128 , with the main axis in the @xmath129 direction and the prime meridian through @xmath130 ( that is , @xmath131 ) . after several steps of calculation one",
    "arrives at the new key formula @xmath132 because of the sine , the integrand is not singular , although it needs to be defined by a limit when @xmath110 .",
    "ultimately we would like to take derivatives of ( [ tpolar ] ) and then pass to the diagonal , but for now we set @xmath110 and @xmath133 immediately : @xmath134 ( as previously remarked , this should yield the expectation value of @xmath135 at  @xmath116 . )    the change of variables has not eliminated the problem , but it has isolated it at the upper limit of a single improper integral .",
    "the convergence of ( [ tpolardiag ] ) is still delicate .",
    "numerical and analytical investigations of it are ongoing . were it not for the convergence issues , one could prove easily from ( [ tpolardiag ] ) that the function manifests approximately inverse - square decay resembling ( [ walltren ] ) , but with the efffective wall position @xmath15 replaced by @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the coefficient of the linear term in ( [ deltasmall ] ) .",
    "numerical integrations have been performed in _ mathematica _ for @xmath1 . despite the instability of the highly oscillatory integrals , the results are qualitatively as expected , approaching @xmath138 already for moderately large @xmath139 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tgraph ] ) .    as this paper",
    "was being drafted , k. milton et al .  reported ( privately",
    "; cf .  @xcite ) an independent evaluation of @xmath101 for @xmath1 using a different integral representation with better convergence properties .",
    "they find a weak ( @xmath140 ) divergence in the energy density at the origin , which in hindsight is to be expected as diffraction from the coefficient singularity there ( which will become less important for larger  @xmath9 ) .",
    "the corresponding singularity in @xmath28 is of order @xmath141 , therefore not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : tgraph ] .",
    "our principal results are the cartesian formula ( [ trencart ] ) , the polar formula ( [ tpolar ] ) , and the latter s diagonal specialization ( [ tpolardiag ] ) , along with the formula ( [ tandelta ] ) for @xmath45 and the asymptotic analyses in the subsection following it .",
    "formulas for energy density and pressure can be obtained by differentiating ( [ tpolar ] ) and again passing to the diagonal .",
    "granted the convergence of the integrals , it can be seen that @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( the pressure in the @xmath12 direction ) are equal and opposite , so that ( [ enbalance ] ) is satisfied in the sideways motion of a plane partition perpendicular to the plane wall .",
    "this happy result , which fulfills the main motivation of the project , follows from the finiteness of the diagonal values ( in the potential - free region ) of the kernel @xmath101 and its derivatives without the need of an artificial cutoff , since it is satisfied by the individual normal modes in the integrand .",
    "detailed calculations in the region @xmath46 have not yet been attempted , since we want to exploit fully the more elementary calculations in @xmath42 first .",
    "also , one may reasonably consider the energy and stress in that region to be part of the wall , not part of the cavity containing the field .",
    "nevertheless , in our setup the properly renormalized stress tensor inside the wall should still be finite and display the physically sensible behavior ( [ enbalance ] ) .",
    "( most of the arguments of the previous subsection still apply here , or can be adapted . )    on general grounds one knows that the renormalization will require subtraction of additional terms from @xmath28 . in a nonsingular model the diagonal divergences in @xmath28 and hence @xmath92 are determined @xcite by the well known small - time divergences of the heat ( or quantum ) kernel @xcite .",
    "wherever the potential @xmath144 is not zero , the energy density calculated with the standard ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath74  held nonzero ) has the expansion @xmath145 the first term corresponds to the universal vacuum energy that has been removed by subtracting the free kernel at ( [ freeren ] ) . the other terms in ( [ vdivs ] ) can be removed by subtracting higher - order terms in the small-@xmath74 expansion of the exact @xmath28 ( obeying ( [ tpde ] ) with the potential included ) .",
    "physically , such terms represent redefinitions of the constants in the equation of motion of the @xmath73 field itself .",
    "a technical issue that must ultimately be addressed here is the validity of ( [ vdivs ] ) when @xmath146 . in particular , for @xmath1 ( [ vdivs ] ) predicts a dirac delta at @xmath57 from the term @xmath147 , and we will not trust the numerical coefficient until a direct calculation has been carried out .",
    "the issue here is the same one that arises in the heat kernel ( and gauss  bonnet theorem ) for the laplacian in a region in the plane : the contributions of the corners of a polygon can not be obtained by naively taking the limit of the effects of the curvature of a smooth boundary .",
    "this is an interesting question to be investigated in the future .",
    "separation of variables , even when it is available , is not always the best way to obtain information about the integral kernels ( and spectral measures ) associated with a linear partial differential operator .",
    "leading terms such as those in ( [ vdivs ] ) are routinely found by direct construction of some kernel as an asymptotic series .",
    "higher - order information can be obtained from terms in the quantum kernel ( green function of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ) corresponding to periodic orbits of the underlying classical mechanical system @xcite .",
    "( these terms are also present in the heat kernel but exponentially suppressed .",
    "they produce oscillatory terms in the averaged eigenvalue density . )    the construction of green functions for the laplace and helmholtz equations in bounded domains in @xmath148 ( billiards ) by reduction to integral equations on the boundary is well known .",
    "the counterpart construction for the heat equation is less familiar but available in the literature @xcite .",
    "what is seldom appreciated is that for the heat equation the solution of the boundary integral equation by iteration is convergent , because the integral operator has volterra structure .",
    "one therefore has , in principle , an explicit construction of the solution .",
    "the schrdinger equation has the same volterra structure , so one expects again to have a convergent series solution .",
    "to implement this idea in a general context , mera @xcite has proved the following _ general volterra theorem _ :    let the kernel @xmath149 be ( for each @xmath74 and @xmath150 in an interval  @xmath151 ) a uniformly bounded linear operator @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is a banach space , and suppose that it has the volterra property , @xmath154 when @xmath155 .",

    "the application of the theorem in any particular context reduces to showing that the operator family @xmath149 is uniformly bounded on a suitable space  @xmath160 . for schrdinger equations",
    "this is a nontrivial task and requires supplementary technical assumptions .",
    "here we are primarily interested in problems with potentials in @xmath148 . in that setting the key idea , due to balian and bloch @xcite ,",
    "is to let the semiclassical or wkb approximation to the quantum kernel play the role played by the free kernel in billiard problems , so that the role played by scattering off the boundary in billiards ( or by scattering by the potential in standard time - dependent perturbation theory ( * ? ? ?",
