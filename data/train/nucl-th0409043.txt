    "results of the recent experiments  @xcite on polarized electron - proton scattering , and their apparent disagreement  @xcite with the electromagnetic form factors ( em ffs ) extracted from rosenbluth cross section measurements , indicate that much remains to be learned about nucleon em interactions . while a definitive understanding of the nucleon em ffs is still lacking , several theoretical models  @xcite are able to describe their momentum - transfer dependence consistently with the jlab experiments  @xcite .",
    "since the ultimate goal is to reach a coherent understanding of all aspects of the nucleon em interactions , important insights can be gained by describing as many different photon - nucleon reactions as possible in a unified theoretical approach . the dressed k - matrix model ( dkm )",
    "@xcite has been developed for a description of real compton scattering in a wide energy region both below and above the pion production threshold .",
    "the central element of this model is a nonperturbative nucleon dressing based on the iterative use of dispersion relation , thus adding analyticity constraints to the properties of relativistic covariance , unitarity , crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the usual k - matrix approaches .",
    "the parameters of the model are not entirely free : the convergence requirement of the dressing procedure imposes constraints on the allowed range of these parameters while introducing an interdependence among them .",
    "the thus constrained parameters were then completely fixed by a fit to compton cross sections and pion - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) phase shifts at intermediate energies  @xcite . with all the parameters fully fixed , low - energy observables  such as the nucleon polarizabilities  @xcite , pion - nucleon scattering lengths and @xmath1-term  @xcite ",
    "were then calculated and shown to agree with experiment .",
    "the main reason for this success is that important analyticity ( causality ) constraints are implemented in dkm by the dressing of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices and of the nucleon and @xmath5 propagators with meson loops up to infinite order .",
    "the extent to which analyticity is fulfilled can be quantified by comparing the low - energy amplitudes with corresponding sum rules , both evaluated within the same model . within dkm ,",
    "such a comparison was made for the baldin - lapidus and gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rules vs.  the nucleon polarizabilities  @xcite , and for the adler - weisberger and goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rules vs.  the near - threshold @xmath0 amplitude  @xcite .",
    "we generally found good agreement between the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations .    in this report",
    "we extend the dressing procedure to the case of virtual space - like photons .",
    "the resulting dressed photon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) vertex has six invariant functions depending on two invariant variables : the four - momenta squared of the photon and of one of the nucleons , the other nucleon being on - shell . by putting both nucleons on the mass shell",
    "we calculate the momentum - transfer dependence of the ratio of the proton em ffs .",
    "we find good agreement of our calculation with the jlab polarization - transfer measurements  @xcite .    the crucial point of this result is that the momentum - transfer dependence of the ratio of the ffs is calculated here with the the _ same _ parameters as used in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the compton and @xmath0 amplitudes at low and intermediate energies .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of dkm captures features which are important in a wide kinematical range relevant to the photon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the most general lorentz - covariant structure of the @xmath2 vertex with an incoming off - shell photon ( four - momentum @xmath6 ) and an incoming off - shell nucleon ( four - momentum @xmath7 ) can be written as  @xcite ^(p , q)= _ r= ( ^ f_1^r(p^2,q^2 ) + i f_2^r(p^2,q^2 ) + f_3^r(p^2,q^2 ) ) _ r(p / ) , where @xmath8 are the nucleon positive- and negative - energy projection operators , and the six invariant functions @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) are called half - off - shell ffs .",
    "the outgoing nucleon is on the mass shell , i.  e.  its four - momentum @xmath12 obeys @xmath13 .",
    "we consider protons interacting with real or virtual space - like photons , i.  e.  @xmath14 .",
    "the usual dirac and pauli ffs , denoted as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , are obtained by putting both the incoming and outgoing nucleons on the mass shell in : f_d , p(q^2 ) = _",
    "p^2 m^2 f_1,2^+(p^2,q^2 ) .",
    "when the two nucleons are on - shell , @xmath17 do not enter the vertex since @xmath18 ; in addition , space - time reflection invariance requires  @xcite that f_3^+(m^2,q^2)=0 .",
    "@xmath19 are related to the sachs ( electric and magnetic ) ffs @xmath20 by g_e(q^2)=f_d(q^2 ) + q^2 f_p(q^2 ) , g_m(q^2)=f_d(q^2 ) + f_p(q^2 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 vertex is calculated by dressing a bare vertex with an infinite number of meson loops including pions and vector isoscalar mesons .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices and the nucleon and @xmath5 propagators , which enter in the loop integrals for the @xmath2 vertex , are also dressed nonperturbatively with pions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons .",
    "the detailed description of the dressing technique for the @xmath2 vertex ( with real photons ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 vertices and the propagators in ref .",
    ". this dressing is part of dkm  @xcite where it amounts to restoring the principal - value parts of loop contributions to the compton and @xmath0 amplitudes .    in the present work we have generalized the dressing procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite from real to virtual space - like photons in .",
    "thus we have calculated the six invariant functions @xmath9 for @xmath23 and @xmath14 , from which the momentum - transfer dependence of the em ffs has been obtained according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : diracpauli ] ) and ( [ eq : sachs ] ) . for brevity , in this report we will focus only on the important new features related to the off - shellness of the photon .",
    "we write the bare vertex as ^ + i _ b + h_b(q^2 ) .",
    "the renormalization consists in choosing the bare constant @xmath24 so that the dressed vertex with all particles on - shell reproduces the physical anomalous magnetic moment of the proton , i.  e.  @xmath25 , and adjusting @xmath26 so that the calculated function @xmath27 obeys .",
    "the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) is a consequence of gauge invariance of the theory  @xcite .",
    "it relates the @xmath2 vertex to the propagator @xmath28 of the off - shell proton : @xmath29 .",
    "thus the wti dictates that the half - off - shell ffs in must obey the following relations : f_1^+ ( p^2,q^2 ) & = & ( - 2 ( p^2 ) ( p^2 ) .",
    "+ q^2 ) , + f_1 ^ -(p^2,q^2 ) & = & ( p^2 ) + q^2 , where the self - energy functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 enter into the dressed nucleon propagator @xmath32^{-1}}$ ] which was calculated together with the dressed @xmath5 propagator and @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices  @xcite . the renormalization conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be explicitly written as ( m^2)(m-(m^2))=0 , 2 m ( m-(m^2 ) ) _ p^2=m^2- ( m^2)(2m_p^2=m^2 -1 ) = 1 .    on expanding in powers of @xmath35 around @xmath36 and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : diracpauli ] ) , ( [ eq : pt_inv_f3pl ] ) , ( [ eq : ren_pole ] ) and ( [ eq : ren_res ] ) , we obtain the wti for the dirac ff of the proton : f_d(q^2 ) = 1 + q^2 ( 2 f_3^+(p^2,q^2 ) p^2 _ p^2=m^2 - ) , yielding the familiar constraint @xmath37 for an on - shell vertex with a real photon . note that we do not impose eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wti_f1pl_off ] ) and ( [ eq : wti_f1mi_off ] )  by hand \" at any stage of the dressing ; nevertheless , the resulting vertex does obey these constraints of the wti due to gauge invariance of the model .",
    "the ratio of the calculated proton em ffs is shown in as function of the photon momentum - squared , @xmath38 , together with the recent jlab measurements  @xcite .",
    "we found that , in order to obtain accurate agreement with experiment over the wide range of momenta - transferred @xmath39 , the coupling of the vector isoscalar particle to the nucleon has to be different from the @xmath40 coupling given in ref .",
    "@xcite : while the part of the vertex proportional to @xmath41 is comparable to that of the @xmath40 vertex ( instead of @xmath42 as in @xcite , now we use @xmath43 ) , the part proportional to @xmath44 has to be quite large ( we need @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 ) .",
    "the other coupling constants are the _ same _ as in  @xcite , i.  e.  as fixed in the description of the @xmath0 and compton scattering processes .",
    "it is important that even without the contribution of the vector isoscalar particle , we find the slope of the ratio of the ffs to be negative at @xmath47 , although in that case it is too steep .",
    "including the vector particle in the dressing makes the slope less steep .",
    "a negative slope of the ratio implies that the electric mean - square radius of the proton is larger that the magnetic mean - square radius normalized to the total magnetic moment , i.  e.  if .",
    "|_q^2=0 < 0 , then taking into account that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and using the usual definitions of the mean - square radii .",
    "= -6 |_q^2=0 , we find > .",
    "note that the traditional one - photon exchange analyses of the rosenbluth cross sections would yield @xmath50 ( see , e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which would imply equal electric and ( normalized ) magnetic radii , in sharp contrast to .",
    "we would also like to point out that the relation in is consistent with the well - known fact that the electric polarizability of the proton , @xmath51 , is larger than its magnetic polarizability , @xmath52 , _",
    "_ m. thus one might speculate that the proton behaves as a  larger \" and hence more  deformable \" object in the presence of an electric field than in the presence of a magnetic field . since the mean - square radii are extracted from the momentum - transfer dependence of the ffs while the polarizabilities from compton scattering , the dressing procedure of dkm could provide a theoretical framework for understanding this ( possibly fortuitous ) similarity between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanrads ] ) and ( [ eq : polaris ] ) .",
    "even though the ratio of the calculated ffs agrees with experiment very well as shown in , the model fails in describing @xmath53 and @xmath54 separately .",
    "this is demonstrated in for the electric ff .",
    "a possible remedy could be to use an appropriate ff in the bare @xmath2 vertex , which would introduce additional cut - off parameters .",
    "we have not done so in the present calculation since our aim is to keep the same model parameters as fixed in describing compton and @xmath0 scattering . in this way we impose a stringent dynamical constraint on the model .",
    "the dependence of the calculated @xmath2 vertex on the momentum - squared @xmath35 of the off - shell proton is illustrated in , where we show the @xmath35-dependence of the ratio of generalized ( half - off - shell ) sachs ffs which we define as g_e^gen(p^2,q^2)=f_1^+(p^2,q^2 ) + q^2 f_2^+(p^2,q^2 ) , g_m^gen(p^2,q^2)=f_1^+(p^2,q^2 ) + f_2^+(p^2,q^2 ) .",
    "the usual sachs ffs eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sachs ] ) are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sachs_gen ] ) by taking the limit @xmath55 in accordance with .",
    "although the half - off - shell ffs are not measurable by themselves  @xcite , they can be an important part of various models for physical processes .",
    "for example , a two - photon exchange contribution to electron - proton scattering contains @xmath2 vertices with an off - shell nucleon leg .",
    "so far the dependence of these vertices on the nucleon off - shell momentum has not been taken into account in the existing approaches  @xcite . our calculation shown in suggests that this dependence may be significant .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that in view of the representation - dependence of the green s functions  @xcite , the calculation of such off - shell vertices should be consistent with the model for the physical processes to which they are applied .",
    "in this report we extended the nonperturbative dressing procedure of the dressed k - matrix model ( dkm ) to calculate a @xmath2 vertex with an off - shell nucleon and an off - shell photon .",
    "the principal motivation for this work is to study the nucleon electromagnetic interactions in a dynamical approach which describes in a unified manner two distinct types of reactions : those where essential contributions come from an off - shell nucleon ( as in compton scattering ) and those where one probes the dependence on the momentum transferred by an off - shell photon ( as in form factors extracted from electron - proton scattering experiments ) .",
    "having previously applied dkm to compton and @xmath0 scattering , in this report we focused on the momentum - transfer dependence .",
    "we developed the dressing procedure to calculate the ratio of the proton electromagnetic form factors and found good agreement of our results with the recent jlab measurements .",
    "the main limitation of the present version of dkm is the difficulty in describing the momentum - transfer dependence of the individual form factors as accurately as their ratio . to resolve this problem , additional dynamical contents  with attendant new parameters",
    " might be required in the model . rather than pursuing this direction in detail , we studied here to what extent one can describe the dependence of the nucleon em interactions on both the nucleon and photon variables using the _ same _ dynamical approach with a few predetermined parameters . our approach is based on essential symmetry constraints , including relativistic and gauge invariance , unitarity , crossing and causality , which are required in order to correlate in one model the very different kinematical regions explored in compton and @xmath0 scattering and in the proton form factors .",
