    "since the very first experiments at frascati , saclay , and nikhef the @xmath0 reaction has been proven a powerful tool for the investigation of nuclear structure  .",
    "the advent of high energy electron beams with high intensity and duty cycle has opened access to the high momentum range , a region expected to reveal peculiar features of the nucleon substructure .",
    "indeed , large virtual photon momentum @xmath1 allows access to distances scales @xmath2 that are comparable or smaller than the nucleon radius . in addition , the @xmath0 meson exchange current ( mec ) mechanism at large @xmath1 is expected to be less important due to the natural decrease built into the meson propagators and form factors .",
    "therefore , one can expect to probe more reliably high initial momenta in the nucleus , that is small inter - nucleon distances , and learn about the origin of the short - range repulsion of the nn interaction from its standard representation up to the most exotic descriptions .",
    "the general framework of nuclear structure studies has been evolving since the first generation of @xmath0 experiments at the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) of the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "this paper reviews our present understanding of the dynamics of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "particularly , the dominance of the final state interactions ( fsi ) and its consequences for the study of the nucleon and nuclear structure are discussed .",
    "future prospects in this domain as well as more exotic use of the @xmath0 reaction in the study of the color transparency ( ct ) phenomenon are also addressed .",
    "the next section introduces the basic concept and description of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "recent results on d  @xcite , @xmath3he  @xcite , and @xmath4he  @xcite are then discussed which allow one to envisage more sensitive investigations of the ct phenomenom  @xcite .",
    "the problem of the left - right asymmetry observable is then discussed on the basis of a comparison between few- and many - body experimental results  . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nncor ] , the most recent investigations of nucleon - nucleon correlations   in the nuclear medium are presented .",
    "finally , the long standing issue of bound nucleon form facors is revisited in light of the new jlab measurements  @xcite .",
    "the merit of quasi - elastic electron scattering for the study of nuclear structure is in the description of the reaction process in the framework of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . in this context ( fig .",
    "[ pwia]a ) , the cross section for the @xmath0 process can be factorized in two terms : one representing the probability of a virtual photon to interact with a proton , that is the electron - bound proton cross section @xmath6  @xcite , and another representing the probability to find a proton in the nucleus with initial momemtum @xmath7 and binding energy @xmath8 , that is the nuclear spectral function @xmath9  . tagging the virtual photon @xmath10 by measuring the four - momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the incoming and scattered electron , and measuring the four - momentum @xmath13 of the knocked - out proton",
    ", one reconstructs @xmath14 within pwia , the momentum @xmath15 of the recoil system is equal to the opposite of the initial momentum @xmath7 of the proton .",
    "then , studying the dependence of the cross section either on @xmath16 or on @xmath17 , one can access directly different features of the nuclear structure .",
    "particularly , at high initial momentum , one can determine the importance and the origin of high momentum components of the nuclear wave function , test the existence of relativistic effects or learn about short range correlations . at high momentum transfer , one can question the validity of the current operator or investigate the electromagnetic properties of bound nucleons , and possible exotic configurations .",
    "however , depending on the kinematics of the reaction , several other mechanisms interfere with the elementary pwia amplitude .",
    "fsi , where the knocked - out proton interacts with the residual nucleus ( fig .  [ 2 - 3body ] ) distort the nuclear information and break the simple factorization scheme of the cross section .",
    "in addition , instead of interacting with nucleons , the photon can couple to the virtual mesons of the nuclear field leading to a large variety of mec contributions ( fig .",
    "[ 2 - 3body ] ) .",
    "one way to disentangle the different reaction mechanisms and select the pwia amplitude is to separate the elementary components or response functions of the cross section and to take advantage of peculiar kinematics conditions .",
    "for instance , mec essentially affect the transverse components of the hadronic current and their effects are expected to decrease at high momentum transfers because of the natural @xmath18 evolution of meson form factors .",
    "the unpolarized cross section for the a@xmath0 process may be written @xmath19\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the mott cross section for a structureless nucleus @xmath21 with @xmath22 the electron scattering angle and @xmath23 the angle between the leptonic and hadronic planes ( fig .",

    "the @xmath24 are the kinematical factors @xmath25^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] depending on the virtual photon four - momentum characteristics ; @xmath26 the relativistic invariant @xmath27 , by convention .",

    "[ reaction ] ) .",
    "the separation of these four response functions requires four different measurements ( @xmath31 on fig .",
    "[ reaction ] ) : measuring the cross section on the right ( @xmath32 ) and left ( @xmath33 ) of the virtual photon at constant @xmath34 and @xmath13 , one extracts the longitudinal - transverse interference response @xmath35 ; an additionnal measurement out of the reaction plane ( @xmath36 ) allows one to obtain the transverse - transverse interference response @xmath37 ; a last measurement at a different beam energy ( @xmath38 ) allows one to separate the longitudinal @xmath39 and transverse @xmath40 responses by changing the electron scattering angle .    following this philosophy ,",
    "several @xmath0 experiments on few - body systems at high momemtum transfer and high recoil momentum have been completed using the high resolution spectrometers  @xcite of the hall a of jlab .",
    "few - body systems are indeed priviledged laboratories since exact microscopic calculations can be achieved involving the full complexity of the nn interaction .",
    "beyond the experimental benefit of the large duty factor of cebaf , the several gev beam energy allows one to access very small cross sections typical of the high recoil momentum region .",
    "therefore , the cross section can be mapped over a large range of recoil momentum without changing the virtual photon probe .",
    "this feature is an important improvment with respect to older experiments at smaller scale facilities : keeping the leptonic vertex onstant gives a better handling of the reaction mechanisms and consequently insures a better interpretation of experimental data .",
    "the first experiment reported here is about deuterium , the elementary laboratory nucleus of the nn interaction .",
    "this d@xmath0 electro - disintegration experiment  @xcite has been performed in quasi - elastic kinematics at @xmath41  gev@xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the recoil neutron is reconstructed ( eq .  [ prequa ] ) perpendicular to the virtual photon .",
    "experimental data are compared in fig .",
    "[ ulmer ] to several calculations .",
    "it is particularly shown that all pwia calculations using different methods and/or nuclear wave functions fail to reproduce the data at large recoil momentum . above 300  mev/@xmath44 ,",
    "fsi drive the cross section and small but still active mec have to be taken into account as shown by calculations from h.  arenhvel  @xcite and j .- m .",
    "laget  @xcite .",
    "because of its higher density , the helium nucleus is expected to reveal more fine details of the nn interaction .",
    "it is also a bridge between few- and many - body systems where one can investigate the strength of three - body forces .    a selected set of data from the @xmath3he@xmath45 jlab experiment  @xcite",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ marat ] .",
    "the experiment was performed in perpendicular kinematics at constant @xmath46  gev@xmath42 and @xmath47 , reaching for the very first time the 1  gev/@xmath44 recoil momentum range .",
    "it corresponds to an unprecedented measurement of the cross section over six orders of magnitude .",
    "the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ marat ] represents the reduced cross section for the three beam energies of the experiment as compared to older results   and a pwia calculation  @xcite ; within pwia , the reduced cross section corresponds to the nuclear spectral function @xmath48 .",
    "good agreement with older data is obtained up to 250  mev/@xmath44 . above this value ,",
    "data dispersion is observed corresponding , for different beam energies , to different magnitude of the reaction mechanisms beyond pwia .",
    "this is confirmed by the comparison to a pwia calculation where the agreement degrades gradually starting about 100  mev/@xmath44 .",
    "similarly to the deuterium case , the high momentum range ( fig .",
    "[ marat ] bottom panel ) exhibits strong effects from the interaction of the knocked - out proton with the residual system : below 300  mev/@xmath44 , the pwia cross section is moderately quenched while above this value strong enhancement of the cross section ( about a factor 5 at 500  mev/@xmath44 ) is observed .",
    "different calculations   confirm that fsi is the driving contribution , mec being quasi - negligible , as expected in this @xmath26 range .",
    "note that , presented at this workhsop , new calculations  @xcite within a relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) show good agreement with data and lead to the same conclusion about the dominance of fsi in this energy range . in the very high momentum region ( fig .",
    "[ marat ] top right ) , which was explored for the very first time , the cross section seems to saturate at an unexpectedly high level .",
    "these data are confirmed by the measurement of the recoil deuteron in the same experiment  @xcite : within a simple jacobian transformation , the @xmath3he@xmath45 cross section is deduced from the measured @xmath3he@xmath49 cross section .",
    "calculations are unable to reproduce this excess of strength at 1  gev/@xmath44 .",
    "whether it is a consequence of the truncation of the diagrammatic expansion  @xcite or a signature of other degrees of freedom is an open question .",
    "more data on this experiment are available in  @xcite , particularly a separation of the response functions was achieved which however does not bring additional information on the nuclear structure due to the magnitude of fsi effects .      another attempt to pin down the nuclear wave function at high recoil momentum",
    "was investigated in a @xmath50he@xmath51h experiment  @xcite .",
    "it was shown by s.  tadokoro et al .",
    "@xcite that this nucleus is particularly sensitive to the details of the short range part of the nn interaction : within an independent particle approach , computing the spectral function from a realistic potential , they found that it shows a typical diffractive pattern which minima position and height are sensitive to the fine structure of the nn interaction . the expected position at about 450  mev/@xmath44 lies in the high momentum range and it is not surprising that a previous experiment at smaller beam energy  @xcite was unable to observe it , suffering from large fsi and mec effects that fill the dip .",
    "the e97 - 111 experiment took data in parallel kinematics which is expected to minimize fsi . here ,",
    "the knocked - out proton and the recoil system are emitted along the direction of the virtual photon . because data were taken at constant beam energy and scattered electron angle , the momentum evolution of the cross section mixed different @xmath34 , as opposed to the previously reported experiment .",
    "experimental data are compared to theoretical calculations in fig .",
    "[ bodo ] : they all show large fsi effects which forbid observation of the minimum .    in conclusion ,",
    "these experiments , which are relatively well understood by theoretical calculations using modern nuclear wave functions , show the dominance of fsi at high recoil momentum .",
    "these large effects consequently forbid us to go beyond the actual knowledge of the nn interaction and learn about the fine details of the wave function .",
    "there are however theoretical expectations and experimental indications   that at large @xmath52 , when the direction of the initial proton momentum is opposed that of the virtual photon , the magnitude of fsi should decrease , enabling the selection of the pwia amplitude .",
    "the main process at work in the interaction of the knocked - out proton with the residual system is the nn scattering . because of the large energy transfer in jlab experiments , the proton can rescatter on a nucleon at rest which then gains momentum and is emitted at about 90@xmath53 with respect to the proton . in this way ,",
    "part of the strength at small initial momentum is shifted towards high recoil momentum .",
    "fsi are then maximal at large @xmath54 in perpendicular kinematics .",
    "more strictly , the position of this maximum corresponds to the singularity of the nucleon propagator which occurs at @xmath55 in the @xmath0 channel  @xcite : the electron scatters on a proton which propagates on - shell in the nuclear medium and rescatters on a nucleon at rest .",
    "since the pwia amplitude falls rapidly with @xmath54 , the on - shell rescattering takes over and dominates at large @xmath54 .",
    "several theoretical treatments of fsi exist in the literature ranging from microscopic to macroscopic approaches : in the diagrammatic approach of j .-",
    "laget , fsi are parametrized in terms on the nn partial wave expansion for @xmath56  mev , and in terms of a high energy parametrization fitted to the nn scattering world data at larger excitation energy  @xcite ; glauber based calculations are also available   as well as a generalized eikonal approximation  @xcite that takes into account the fermi motion of the target nucleon , as opposed to glauber ; optical potential approaches have also been developped  @xcite .",
    "this important theoretical activity as well as the still open question of the origin of the high momentum components of the wave function has motivated a systematic study of the @xmath0 reaction in the elementary deuterium nucleus .",
    "the e01 - 020 experiment  @xcite has measured the angular distribution of the recoil neutron ( or @xmath52 distribution   and @xmath54 , the angle of the recoil particle and the @xmath52 variable are linked via a unique relationship , large @xmath52 corresponding to small recoil angles . ] ) in the d@xmath0 reaction over the complete allowed phase space at fixed @xmath26 and @xmath54 .",
    "preliminary data  @xcite at @xmath57  gev@xmath42 and several recoil momenta are reported in fig .",
    "[ werner ] in terms of the ratio of the measured experimental cross section to a model calculation of the pwia amplitude . a point - to - point comparison to theoretical calculations should not be attempted here because of the very preliminary stage of the analysis , only the general shape and behaviour of the data is relevant .",
    "the general trend of data is in agreement with calculations , showing a moderate fsi quenching of the cross section at small @xmath54 and an impressive fsi enhancement at large @xmath54 . at 400",
    "mev/@xmath44 recoil momentum , the peak position is shifted below @xmath55 which , similarly to the on - shell nucleon mechanism , corresponds to the propagation of an on - shell @xmath58 resonance in the nuclear medium .    this simple on - shell rescattering mechanism which relies on elementary on - shell",
    "amplitudes opens an original use of the @xmath0 reaction , namely , the study of the ct phenomenom in few - body systems  .",
    "color transparency is a direct consequence of quantum chromo - dynamics that predicts the existence , in the nucleon wave function , of a minimal valence state where the quarks are very close together and constitute a small size color neutral object ( or mini - hadron ) .",
    "such a color singlet system can not emit or absorb soft gluons and therefore experiences much reduced strong interaction with other nucleons when travelling through the nuclear medium .",
    "the experimental evidence of ct not only requires the selection of a small size configuration but also a clear signature of the subsequent reduced interaction . as of now ,",
    "the several experimental attempts   to search for ct in many - body systems have failed .",
    "the common understanding is that the coherence length , that is the distance needed for the mini - hadron to evolve from its minimal valence state toward its asymptotic wave function , is too small with respect to the typical nuclear scale .",
    "few - body systems may solve this problem by taking advantage of the dominance of fsi in perpendicular quasi - elastic kinematics : the signature of ct would appear as a decrease of the cross section at @xmath55 as a function of @xmath26 , due to the gradual suppression of fsi with diminishing mini - hadron size .",
    "a similar example is shown on fig .",
    "[ colo12 ] in the context of the 12  gev upgrade project at jlab  @xcite .",
    "the merits of the energy upgrade to access a wide @xmath52 range at large @xmath26 is obvious .",
    "this particularly allows the study of the d@xmath0 reaction in the quasi - elastic region where the existence of ct would lead to large effects on the cross section .",
    "as explained in sec .  [ sec : eep ] , the study of @xmath0 reactions at jlab is not restricted to cross section measurements . some experiments aimed at and achieved a separation of the response functions  .",
    "particularly , the longitudinal - transverse interference response was extracted . from the same data",
    ", one can also reconstruct the @xmath60 observable ( see fig .",
    "[ reaction ] ) @xmath61 which corresponds to the left - right asymmetry with respect to the virtual photon .",
    "this observable downplays the significance of the ground - state wave function by virtue of the ratio involved in its definition  @xcite .",
    "there exists indications that it is sensitive to relativistic effects at small momentum ( @xmath62  mev/@xmath44 )  @xcite , and more generally to any mechanism that breaks the simple factorization scheme of the cross section  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ alt ] shows the experimental data for this observable measured in the e89 - 003  @xcite and e89 - 044  @xcite experiments for the @xmath63o and @xmath3he nuclei , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 shows a typical oscillating pattern characteristic from factorization breakdown which originates however from quite different mechanisms in each case . in the @xmath63o case ,",
    "different calculations   show that the oscillation comes from relativistic corrections to the proton wave function via the enhancement of lower spinor components  @xcite . in the @xmath3he case ,",
    "fsi are responsible for this behaviour   which occurs at a similar recoil momentum .",
    "it is instructive to compare on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ alt ] the microscopic ( j .- m .",
    "laget ) and mean field approach ( j.  udias _ et al ; _ ) calculations . an important feature of the relativistic calculation is the breakdown of the cross section factorization at the pwia level  @xcite which generates the large oscillation seen at high recoil momentum .",
    "this feature is not reproduced by the microscopic approach which has a smooth variation in pwia .",
    "when taking into account fsi within two different methods @xmath64 optical potential for the many - body approach and high energy parametrization of the nn scattering for the microscopic one @xmath64 both calculations get similar agreement with data .",
    "this not only confirms the importance of fsi but also the relative insensitivity of @xmath60 to the nuclear wave function , and would suggest that this observable is more sensitive to the elementary current operator .",
    "there are no microscopic calculations for @xmath63o but the difference between distorted non - relativistic and relativistic calculations clearly signifies the importance of relativistic corrections to the wave function .",
    "it is still a mystery how the same observable can be sensitive or insensitive to the wave function depending on the nucleus .",
    "the decrease of the nuclear density when going from @xmath63o to @xmath3he has been proposed to explain the supression of relativistic effects  @xcite .",
    "the e01 - 108 experiment  @xcite will study the @xmath0 reaction in @xmath50he for kinematical conditions similar to the @xmath3he experiment  @xcite investigating , among other observables , @xmath60 .",
    "the higher density of the @xmath50he nucleus will allow this feature to be tested and make a bridge between many - body and few - body approaches .",
    "the search for nn correlations with the @xmath65 and @xmath66 reactions is also an important topic of the jlab experimental program . at high recoil momentum ,",
    "one expects to learn about the short - range repulsive part of the nn interaction , and at some point , to abandon the traditional mesonic description of the nuclear field in favor of a smaller scale description involving the quark substructure of the nucleon .",
    "one possible experimental method to study this issue is to select a correlated pair in the nucleus and measure the recoil momentum distribution  @xcite . in pwia ,",
    "the residual system does not participate in the reaction and consequently , the @xmath54 distribution directly reflects the initial momentum distribution . within this context the selection of a correlated pair in a a@xmath0 experiment is insured by a strict kinematical relationship bewteen @xmath8 and @xmath54 @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are the nucleons and nuclei mass involved in the process .",
    "thus , in pwia , a signature of the disintegration of a correlated pair is the appearance of a peak in the cross section as a function of @xmath8 , in the continuum region , which position depends on @xmath54 .",
    "this experimental method was applied in the e89 - 044 experiment  @xcite at jlab which has investigated the @xmath3he@xmath69 electro - disintegration of the @xmath3he nucleus in the continuum region .",
    "data taking was performed in perpendicular kinematics up to 1  gev/@xmath44 , at constant electron momentum and angle allowing for a better control of the hadronic current .",
    "in addition , as compared to previous experiments  , the @xmath8 acceptance of the jlab experiment is large enough to investigate the pair momentum distribution without suffering from truncation and subsequent extrapolation of the spectra of the relative energy of the pair  @xcite .    the experimental missing energy distribution for selected recoil momenta is compared in fig .",
    "[ 3bbu ] to different calculations .",
    "a broad peak is observed at about the expected location , supporting the observation of a correlated pair in @xmath3he .",
    "however , calculations clearly show that the measured strength can only be explained by large fsi contributions and a significant mec correction at small recoil momentum .",
    "it originates mainly from the re - interaction in the pair and to a lesser extent from the re - interaction with the residual nucleon .",
    "therefore , as in the two - body disintegration case ( sec .  [ sec:2bbu ] ) , it is not possible to extract an exact value of the actual pair momentum distribution because of the small contribution of the pwia amplitude to the reaction cross section .",
    "in fact , the relationship of eq .",
    "[ rel:3bbu ] is valid as long as the reaction involves two active nucleons with a spectator residual system . when the nucleon of the active pair rescatters , the position , the width and the shape of the peak might all be affected , the fsi dominance in the pair being consistent with previous observations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : deuton ] ) .    in the abscence of factorization of the cross section",
    ", one can reconstruct the effective momentum distribution ( also known as the reduced cross section in the literature ) , extracted from data by removing the electron dependent part . in the particular case of the e89 - 044 experiment , the two - body and three - body breakup channels",
    "were simultaneously measured , at the same electron kinematics .",
    "therefore , the comparison between the two effective momentum distributions tells about the nuclear structure .",
    "[ effdens ] particularly suggests that high momentum configurations preferably originate from correlated pairs in the nucleus .",
    "using modern potentials and nuclear wave functions , theoretical calculations are in good agreement with data , and confirm the important role of short - range correlations .",
    "while @xmath0 reactions lead as today to indirect evidence of short - range correlations , there are expectations that two - body knockout reactions would provide direct and sensitive measurements . to date ,",
    "the few achieved experiments in many- and few - body systems   still show strong sensitivity to competing reaction mechanisms involving fsi , mec and @xmath58 excitation ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the e89 - 027 experiment  @xcite in hall b of jlab takes advantage of the large phase space coverage of clas ( cebaf large acceptance spectrometer )  @xcite to study the @xmath3he@xmath70 reaction over a wide range of energy and momentum transfers . by selecting all nucleon momenta above the fermi momentum and restricting the perpendicular component ( transverse to @xmath71 ) of the fast nucleon to below 300  mev/@xmath44",
    ", the emphasis is put on configurations where the virtual photon interacts with the leading nucleon while the associated correlated pair stays at rest  @xcite . for such configurations , different calculations",
    "show that fsi and two - body currents of the leading nucleon are suppressed but the continuum state interactions of the spectator pair and three - body exchange currents play an important role , distorting the elementary nuclear information .    in the near future , with the help of the newly built big bite spectrometer  @xcite , nn correlations will be investigated in carbon  @xcite for anti - parallel kinematics where the pwia amplitude is expected to be dominant .",
    "there are many reasons to at least question the electromagnetic properties of bound nucleons as compared to free ones : within the nuclear field , the nucleon mass changes from its free value to an effective value depending on the intensity of the binding force ; the bound dirac spinors describing nucleons differ from free ones , the enhancement of the lower spinor components being the basic effect of relativistic corrections in @xmath60  @xcite ; there are three different prescriptions for the current operator which are equivalent for on - shell nucleons only , and which would strictly lead to twelve different form factors for bound nucleons instead of the two usual dirac and pauli form factors  @xcite ... unfortunately , the determination of the modifications of nucleon properties can only be done within a model : nucleon changes like the polarization of the surrounding meson cloud or the excitation of the quark hard core are intertwined with conventional mec and isobar currents . an experimental method to minimize these effects and get closer to the in - medium nucleon information is the measurement of polarization transfer observables   in quasi - elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons . in the free proton case",
    ", one can write @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the measured transverse and longitudinal components of the proton polarization .",
    "this method was successfully applied in the measurement of the electric form factor of the free proton  , one of the most important experimental result of the decade which points to the existence of quark orbital momentum .",
    "thanks to these data , the possible existence of two photon exchange contributions  @xcite strongly questions cross section measurements to access the nucleon form factors at high @xmath26 . in addition",
    ", the polarization transfer method is supposed to be intrinsically less sensitive to many - body effects .    following a previous measurement at small @xmath26 in mami  @xcite , the jlab e93 - 049 experiment  @xcite had investigated this problem in the @xmath50he@xmath75h quasi - elastic scattering where theoretical calculations predict a sizeable change of the proton electromagnetic form factors , originating mainly from the enhancement of the lower spinor components of the in - medium quark wave function  @xcite .",
    "experimental data  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ bff ] together with several calculations .",
    "the most modern calculations considering free form factors and many - body dynamics fail to reproduce data .",
    "agreement is only obtained after including in these calculations the predicted modifications  @xcite .",
    "the authors  @xcite claim for an evidence of medium modifications .",
    "however , the accuracy of the data does not yet allow a definitive conclusion .",
    "it is the purpose of the e03 - 104 experiment  @xcite to provide high accuracy data ( fig .",
    "[ bff ] ) in this momentum range and hopefully confirm this finding .",
    "to date , the @xmath0 jlab experimental program on few - body systems has established the dominance of fsi on top of the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "fsi are responsible for moderate quenching ( @xmath76  mev/@xmath44 ) and large enhancement ( @xmath77  mev/@xmath44 ) of the cross section , and result in a large oscillation in @xmath60 .",
    "the same mechanism also obscures the signal from correlated nucleon pairs .",
    "this all confirms that the high momentum components of the nuclear wave function can not be measured in such kinematics , but hopefully more reliably at large @xmath52 , as predicted by models .",

    "<S> this paper presents a selected review of the @xmath0 experimental program recently completed at the jefferson laboratory in the domain of high momentum transfer and high recoil momentum . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis is put on the current understanding of the reaction mechanisms and of the large final state interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> their consequences on the study of the nuclear wave function and nucleon - nucleon correlations are addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the short and long term future of the @xmath0 experimental program is also discussed in the perspective of the study of the quark and gluon structure of nucleons and nuclei . </S>"
