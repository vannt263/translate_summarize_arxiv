    "in this paper we explore an operator theoretic approach to self similarity and fractals which is common to problems involving both iterated function systems ( ifss ) , and an aspect of quantum communication .",
    "each of the two areas involves a finite set of operations : in the case of ifss they are geometric , and in the quantum case , they involve channels of hilbert spaces and associated operator systems .",
    "the particular aspects of ifss we have in mind are studied in @xcite ; and the relevant results from quantum communication in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we begin the introduction with some background on ifss , and we motivate our present operator theoretic approach . the operator theory and its applications are then taken up more systematically in section 2 below .",
    "it was proved recently that a class of non - linear fractals is amenable to a computational harmonic analysis .",
    "while this work is motivated by applications , it is significant in its own right ; for example these fractals do not carry the structure of groups , and so they do not come with a haar measure .",
    "nonetheless , they have natural equilibrium measures @xmath3 which serve as substitutes .",
    "specifically , these fractals are known as iterated function systems ( ifs ) indicating the recursive nature of their construction .",
    "but the analysis so far has been limited to ifss without essential overlap ( see definition [ defcon.essove ] ) .",
    "the ifs fractals @xmath10 are built by passing to a certain limit in a scaling iteration , and the overlap  here refers to the parts of smaller scale - level .",
    "we identify overlap  for a given @xmath10 relative to the equilibrium measure @xmath3 for @xmath10 . while there is prior work on some isolated cases of overlap , the cases that are understood are those of negligible overlap . in this paper",
    "we identify and study the harmonic analysis of ifss with substantial overlap .",
    "an iterated function system ( ifs ) is a system of contractive mappings @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( finite ) where y is a complete metric space .",
    "every such ifs has a unique ( up to scale ) equilibrium measure ( also called the hutchinson measure @xmath3 ) , and we study the hilbert space @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we extend previous work on ifss without overlap .",
    "our method involves systems of operators generalizing the more familiar cuntz relations from operator algebra theory , and from subband filter operators in signal processing . before turning to the details , below we outline briefly the operator - theoretic approach to ifss .    for each @xmath11",
    ", there is a simple cuntz @xmath12-algebra on generators and relations , and its representations offer a useful harmonic analysis of general ifss , but there is a crucial difference between ifss without overlap and those with essential overlap ( this will be made precise in section [ mul ] ) .",
    "the operators generating the appropriate cuntz relations @xcite are composition operators , e.g. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the given ifs .",
    "if the particular ifs is essentially non - overlapping , it is relatively easy to compute the adjoint operators @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 operators will be isometries in @xmath4 with orthogonal ranges . in a way , for the more difficult case of essential overlap , we can use the extra terms entering into the computation of the adjoint operators @xmath9 as a measure  of the essential overlap for the particular ifs we study . here",
    "the adjoint operators @xmath9 refer to the hilbert space @xmath4 where @xmath3 is carefully chosen .",
    "when the ifs is given , there are special adapted measures @xmath3 .",
    "we will be using the equilibrium measure @xmath3 for the given ifs @xmath6 , and by @xcite , this @xmath3 contains much essential information about the ifs , even in the classical cases of ifss coming from number theory .",
    "so far , earlier work in the general area was restricted to ifss without overlap .",
    "for example , cuntz - like operator systems were used in recent papers on wavelets analysis by baggett , jorgensen , merrill and packer @xcite , where they serve as a first step to generating wavelet bases of parseval type ( alias normalized tight frames ) , i.e. , wavelet bases with redundancy .",
    "similarly , it was shown in work by dutkay and jorgensen @xcite that the iterative operator approach works well for generating wavelets on fractals from ifss without overlap .",
    "but so far the more general and more difficult case of essential overlap has resisted previous attempts at a harmonic analysis , and explicit basis constructions in particular .    in this paper ( section [ ove ] ) we show that certain combinatorial cycles from a symbolic encoding @xcite of our ifss yield an attractive computational analysis of the `` ifs - overlap . ''",
    "some results ( e.g. , corollary [ corovenov29.lowerbound ] ) are stated only for a model example , but as indicated the idea with cycle - counting works in general .    while the modern study of iterated function systems ( ifss ) has roots in classical problems from number theory , infinite products @xcite , and more generally from probability and harmonic analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the subject took a more systematic turn in 1981 with the influential paper @xcite by hutchinson . since then , ifss have found uses in geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in infinite network problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in wavelets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in dynamics and operator theory @xcite .",
    "but in operator algebras , the subject has its own independent start with the paper by cuntz @xcite . in operator - algebra theory , a class of representations of what have become known as the cuntz , or the cuntz ",
    "krieger , algebras is ideally suited for the study of iterative processes ( including ifss ) in mathematics and in mathematical physics .",
    "perhaps the paper @xcite started this trend , but it was continued in various guises in the following papers : see @xcite and later related papers by popescu , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "the cuntz and the related @xmath13-algebras have become ubiquitous tools in the study of iterative systems , or in the analysis of fractals or of graphs .",
    "one reason for this is that there is an unexpected connection to signal and image processing ; see @xcite .",
    "they are algebras on generators and relations ; and often , as is the case in the present paper , the generators may be identified as substitution operators @xcite . however , these substitution operators and their adjoints ( often called transfer operators ) are of independent interest ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    since the cuntz and related @xmath13-algebras",
    "typically are naturally generated by a finite set of concrete operators , it has become customary to study such finite sets as matrices with operator entries ; for example , a class of vectors with operator entries are studied in @xcite as row contractions . in fact , it is convenient to distinguish between row vectors with operator entries , and the corresponding columns of operators : one is the adjoint of the other . in this paper ,",
    "our study of ifss with overlap leads naturally to a family of column isometries , where the operator entries in our column vectors are substitution operators built from the maps that define the ifs under consideration .    while there is already a rich literature on ifss without overlap , the more difficult case of overlap",
    "has received relatively less attention ; see , however , @xcite .",
    "the point of view of the latter three papers is generalized number expansions in the form of random variables : real numbers are expanded in a basis which is a fraction , although the `` digits '' are bits ; with infinite strings of bits identified in a bernoulli probability space .",
    "it turns out the distribution of the resulting random variables is governed by the measures which arise as a special cases of hutchinson s analysis @xcite of ifss with overlap .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "however , concrete results about these measures have been elusive .",
    "for example , it is proved in @xcite that the measures for expansions in a basis corresponding to ifss with overlap and given by a scaling parameter are known to be absolutely continuous for a.e .",
    "value of the parameter .",
    "in this paper we consider a rather general class of ifss with overlap .",
    "we show that they can be understood in terms of the spectral theory of cuntz - like column isometries .",
    "moreover we show that our column isometries yield exact representations of the cuntz relations precisely when the ifs has overlap of measure zero , where the measure is an equilibrium measure @xmath3 of the hutchinson type .",
    "there is a separate development related to the study of fourier bases in the hilbert spaces @xmath4 for @xmath3 an ifs equilibrium measure ; see @xcite . we address some of these issues below , but it turns out that exact fourier bases for the case of ifs with overlap are harder to come by .",
    "further , in @xcite , the coauthors noted that fourier bases in @xmath4 can only exist if the equilibrium measure @xmath3 has equal weights , and so in the present paper , we make this assumption .",
    "recent references @xcite deal with wavelet constructions on non - linear attractors @xmath10 , such as arise from systems of branched mappings , e.g. , finite affine systems ( affine ifss ) , or julia sets @xcite generated by branches of the inverses of given rational mappings of one complex variable .",
    "these @xmath10 come with associated equilibrium measures @xmath3 .",
    "however , due to geometric obstructions , it is typically not possible for the corresponding @xmath14 to carry orthonormal bases ( onbs ) of complex exponentials , i.e. , fourier bases .",
    "we showed instead in @xcite that wavelet bases may be constructed in ambient @xmath4 hilbert spaces via multiresolutions and representations of cuntz - like operator relations in @xmath14 as in definitions [ defmul.coliso ] and [ defmul.repcun ] in the next section .",
    "in quantum communication ( the study of ( quantum ) error - correction codes ) , certain algebras of operators and completely positive mappings form the starting point ; see especially the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they take the form of a finite number of channels of hilbert space operators @xmath15 which are assumed to satisfy certain compatibility conditions .",
    "the essential one is that the operators from a partition of unity , or rather a partition of the identity operator @xmath16 in the chosen hilbert space . here",
    "( definition [ defmul.coliso ] ) we call such a system @xmath17 a column isometry .",
    "an extreme case of this is when a certain cuntz relation ( definition [ defmul.repcun ] ) is satisfied by @xmath17 . referring back to our ifs application , the extreme case of the operator relations turn out to correspond to the limiting case of non - overlap , i.e. , to the case when our ifss have no essential overlap ( definition [ defcon.essove ] ) .    in this section",
    "we outline some uses of ideas from multivariable operator theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in iterated function systems ( ifs ) with emphasis on _ ifss with overlap_. the tools we use are _ column isometries _ and systems of _ composition operators_.

    "@xmath30 , but it is not necessarily onto @xmath23 .",
    "this means that in general the matrix operator @xmath31 is a proper _",
    "projection_. by this we mean that the block matrix@xmath32 satisfies the following system of identities:@xmath33 note that @xmath34 if and",
    "only if@xmath35    [ defmul.repcun]a column isometry @xmath29 satisfies @xmath36 if and only if it defines a representation of the cuntz algebra @xmath37 . in that case , the operators @xmath38 are isometries in @xmath18 with orthogonal ranges , and@xmath39    [ remmul.dimfin]the distinction between the operator relations in definitions and is much more than a technicality : definition is the more restrictive . because of the orthogonality axiom in definition , it is easy to see that if a hilbert space @xmath18 carries a nonzero representation of the cuntz relations definition see @xcite , then @xmath18 must be infinite - dimensional , reflecting the infinitely iterated and orthogonal subdivision of projections , a hallmark of fractals .",

    "<S> our method involves systems of operators generalizing the more familiar cuntz relations from operator algebra theory , and from subband filter operators in signal processing .    </S>",
    "<S> these cuntz - like operator systems were used in recent papers on wavelets analysis by baggett , jorgensen , merrill and packer , where they serve as a first step to generating wavelet bases of parseval type ( alias normalized tight frames ) , i.e. , wavelet bases with redundancy .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it was shown in work by dutkay and jorgensen that the iterative operator approach works well for generating wavelets on fractals from ifss without overlap . </S>",

    "<S> if the particular ifs is essentially non - overlapping , it is relatively easy to compute the adjoint operators @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 operators will be isometries in @xmath4 with orthogonal ranges . for the case of essential overlap , we can use the extra terms entering in the computation of the operators @xmath9 as a measure  of the essential overlap for the particular ifs we study . here </S>",
