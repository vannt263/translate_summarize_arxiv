    "the brightness profiles ( limb darkenings ) of stars are a potentially powerful probe of their atmospheres as a function of depth . at each point along the projected radius of a star , the observed flux originates from a range of physical depths , the deepest of which ( the surface of last scattering ) increases with physical radius as one s line of sight progresses from the center of the star towards its limb .",
    "hence , since stellar temperatures generally fall towards the surface , one expects that the limb will appear cooler ( and therefore redder and fainter ) than the center .",
    "if model atmospheres accurately reflect the physical conditions of the star as a function of depth , they should reproduce the star s limb - darkening profile .",
    "because limb darkening is a photometric quantity , it can , in principle , be measured to high precision .",
    "the drawback is that one has to be able to determine where on the star the light is coming from .",
    "historically , there are two ways this is done .",
    "the first is resolving the star .",
    "the most obvious example would be the sun @xcite .",
    "recent advances in interferometry have allowed one to resolve the surfaces of the highest angular - diameter stars @xcite and have in recent years provided data good enough to begin challenging models .",
    "the second method is by occultation , either by an object in our solar system or one orbiting the observed star .",
    "the moon is the only occulter used in our solar system .",
    "however , while lunar occultations are sufficiently precise to demonstrate that limb - darkened models are superior to uniform - brightness models , they lack the precision to test limb - darkening models .",
    "if the occulting body is in the source s system , it can be a star or a planet .",
    "if it is a star , the system is more properly referred to as an eclipsing binary . while such systems would seem to have great potential ,",
    "it is extremely difficult to disentangle the limb - darkened profile from other parameters describing the fit to an eclipsing binary lightcurve @xcite .",
    "the first extra - solar transiting planet to be discovered is hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "because the planet is much smaller and darker than the star , its transits can be used to trace the stellar light profile in great detail @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is generally expected that ongoing and future transit surveys will turn up several more such systems .",
    "there is one other method that can distinguish between light coming from different parts of a star .",
    "if a star passes through a microlensing pattern , different parts of the star are magnified by different amounts . in practice ,",
    "differential magnification is significant only when the star passes through a caustic , which is a region of formally infinite magnification for a point source .",
    "up to now , the best measurement of microlens limb darkening has been from macho 97-blg-28 @xcite .",
    "this is because the event included a cusp crossing and thus the magnification pattern was sharper , thereby giving better resolution across the star .",
    "in addition , the data for this event are very good . @xcite were able to measure two limb - darkening parameters each in @xmath0 and @xmath3 for the k giant source .",
    "they demonstrated that the resulting surface profiles are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of atmospheric models for stars of the same spectral type .",
    "however , they were not able to challenge these models .",
    "@xcite obtained a linear limb - darkening coefficient in each of four bands for an a star in the small magellanic cloud ( macho 98-smc-1 ) .",
    "they confirmed the expected trend of increased limb darkening toward the blue , but the measurements are not precise enough to challenge models .",
    "the primary difficulty is that the source star is extremely faint , @xmath9 , so that even when it is highly magnified , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is modest .",
    "@xcite obtained linear limb - darkening coefficients for a red clump giant ( macho 97-blg-41 ) . even though the event itself was quite favorable , with three caustic crossings and a cusp crossing , bad weather and bad luck combined to limit the sensitivity of the data to limb darkening .",
    "the limb darkening analysis of ogle-1999-bul-23 by @xcite was a major breakthrough in this subject .",
    "they developed a method to simultaneously compare limb - darkening measurements in two bands ( @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) to the predictions of a whole suite of atmospheric models .",
    "the analysis demonstrated a conflict only at the @xmath10 level , so no significant conclusions could be drawn .",
    "however , if the density of measurements had been higher or the errors smaller , this technique would have been able to give observational input into atmospheric modeling of the limb darkening of a moderately evolved star for the first time .    the binary - lens microlensing event , eros blg-2000 - 5  provides the best constraints on limb darkening by any microlensing event .",
    "this event has a caustic crossing that is four days long .",
    "this extraordinarily long timescale and the generally excellent weather for all four days at all five observatories combine to yield an extremely high density of coverage of the source crossing in units of its own radius . the first caustic crossing is well measured ( fortuitously since its onset can not be predicted beforehand ) , and the event contains a cusp approach in addition to the two caustics .",
    "hence , this event is better constrained than any other microlensing event @xcite . with",
    "the physical parameters of the event well constrained , higher order terms in the microlensing parameterization ( such as limb darkening ) can be precisely determined . finally , we have spectroscopic data for this star ( taken when it was highly magnified ) that give us independent information about its temperature , metallicity and surface gravity .",
    "this combination of information allows us to to confront model atmospheres of what we determine to be a k3 iii star in all five bands . we will test the kurucz atlas models @xcite in the johnson - cousins @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , and the hauschildt next@xmath11gen models in the same johnson - cousins bands plus two eros bands , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "the next@xmath11gen models are the current versions of the nextgen models described in @xcite .",
    "in our analysis of eros blg-2000 - 5  we make use of 11 data sets in five filters .",
    "the planet collaboration contributes nine data sets in three standard filters , 3 sets in @xmath0 , 4 in @xmath3 and 2 in @xmath4 .",
    "a description of the @xmath3 band data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 band data are very similar in quality to the @xmath3 band , the main difference being that they contain about half the number of points .",
    "the @xmath4 band data were taken at saao and yalo by the instruments dandicam and andicam , respectively .",
    "the instruments and procedures are identical in these two cases , and each contains a tek @xmath12 ccd and a rockwell @xmath13 hgcdte ir array .",
    "the light path contains a dichroic that allows optical and near - ir images to be obtained simultaneously at the same position on the sky .",
    "the @xmath4 band images are constructed by averaging five contiguous dithered frames of 60s each .",
    "the dithered images are flat - field corrected and then used to create a median sky image , which is subtracted from the individual frames before they are shifted and co - added .",
    "the last two data sets are from the eros collaboration . these consist of @xmath0-like and @xmath3-like bands ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) that are described in @xcite . in the same manner as @xcite , each",
    "data set is cleaned of bad points and has its errors rescaled so that the reduced @xmath14 is unity at the best - fit model .",
    "note that the number of points in the planet @xmath3 band data sets may be individually different from that given in @xcite as these cuts were done independently .",
    "however , since the total difference is only 10 points out of 1287 , the impact on our conclusions is negligible .",
    "the attributes of the data sets are given in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "we continue the model formalism of @xcite , which contains 11 geometric parameters .",
    "seven of these are static binary lens parameters : the lens separation in units of the einstein radius @xmath15 ( henceforth simply @xmath16 ) , the binary lens mass ratio @xmath17 , the angle between the direction of motion of the source and the binary lens axis @xmath18 , the distance between the cusp and the source at closest approach @xmath19 , the time taken to travel an einstein radius @xmath20 , the time of closest approach to the cusp @xmath21 , the ratio of source radius to einstein radius @xmath22 .",
    "two are rotational parameters : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and two are vector components of microlens parallax : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the derivation of this parameterization and its relation to the standard formalism is given in @xcite .",
    "our geometrical solution and that of @xcite are given in table  [ tab : soln ] .",
    "in addition , each observatory and band has its own five photometric parameters : the unmagnified source flux @xmath27 , the blend flux @xmath28 , a linear seeing correction @xmath29 , a linear limb - darkening parameter @xmath30 , and a square - root limb - darkening parameter @xmath31 .",
    "these photometric parameters are returned from a linear fit to the magnification curve determined by the 11 geometrical parameters . for each band ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) that is observed from several observatories ,",
    "all observatories are constrained to give the same values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the form of the limb - darkening law we use is , @xmath32 \\,,\\ ] ] which conserves flux independent of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath33 being the mean surface brightness of the source and @xmath34 the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight .",
    "this law is a different form of the more widely - used , @xmath35 \\ .\\ ] ] it should be noted , however , that equation  ( [ eqn : slimb ] ) is normalized to the flux at the center , and thus the total flux is a function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    the transformation of the coefficients in equation  ( [ eqn : limblaw ] ) to the usual coefficients used in equation  ( [ eqn : slimb ] )",
    "is given by , @xmath39 while the inverse transformation is @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the limb - darkening parameters are primarily determined by the behavior of the light curve between the time the source edge enters the caustic and the time the source center enters the caustic ( and the inverse of this process as the source leaves the caustic ) .",
    "we then take this model and expand it to include all five bands , constraining all observations in the same band to give the same limb - darkening parameters .",
    "however , since there are no seeing data for eros , these two bands do not have seeing corrections .",
    "this gives our model a total of 11 ( geometric ) + [ 5 ( photometric ) @xmath42  11 ( data sets ) @xmath43 ( eros seeing coefficients ) ] = 64 fit parameters , which are then subject to [ ( 2 @xmath0 + 3 @xmath3 + 1 @xmath4 ) @xmath44(limb - darkening parameters)]@xmath45 constraints .",
    "we then take this model and search for minima in @xmath14 in the 11-dimensional space of the geometrical parameters .",
    "we employ a simple grid search algorithm and not a more efficient technique such as simplex because the ( apparent ) @xmath14 surface is rough with many false minima .",
    "this problem forces us to restrict our automated grid search to nine of the geometrical parameters and to step through the remaining two ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) `` by hand . ''",
    "even so , we find that we can locate the true minimum only to within @xmath46 in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , despite the fact that the true errors in these parameters ( as determined from the curvature of the @xmath14 surface measured over larger scales ) are @xmath47 .",
    "that is , the apparent @xmath14 varies by @xmath48 for the same ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) when we initialize our search using different values of the other nine parameters .",
    "we believe that this roughness is most likely due to numerical noise , rather than roughness in the `` true '' @xmath14 surface",
    ". however , regardless of the exact cause of the roughness of the surface , its impact via increased uncertainty in ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) on the errors in the limb - darkening parameters must be assessed .",
    "this will be done in  [",
    "sec : errors ] .",
    "we start the grid search near the minimum found by @xcite . to save computation cycles , we first do a grid search using only @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 band data . after the new minimum has been approximately located , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band data are finally used .",
    "as stated above , the fitting routine finds both linear @xmath30 and square - root @xmath31 limb - darkening parameters .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath4 band , the degeneracy between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is too severe for this 2-parameter fit to provide useful information . because @xmath49 is consistent with zero ,",
    "we constrain it to be exactly zero and report only @xmath50 .",
    "the analysis is then redone giving us 64 parameters subject to 13 constraints , which , since two parameters are constrained to be zero , is equivalent to 62 parameters with 11 constraints .",
    "the limb darkening of the best - fit microlens model is shown in figure  [ fig : fivebands ] .",
    "contributions to the error in the limb - darkening parameters can be broken down into three sources : the photometric ( which include limb - darkening ) parameters , the geometric parameters we minimize over , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the covariance matrix from the photometric parameters is easily obtained as it is a byproduct of the linear fit that solves for the photometric parameters .",
    "this is done holding all the geometric parameters fixed .",
    "we then apply the hybrid statistical error analysis as given in appendix d of @xcite to determine the combined covariance matrix for the nine geometrical + 53 photometric parameters .",
    "while this approach does yield an invertible covariance matrix , there are reasons not to trust this method in this particular instance .",
    "we have stated above in  [ sec : grid ] that the apparent @xmath14 surface is rough , with numerical noise a possible culprit .",
    "an effect of numerical noise upon the ideal @xmath14 parabola is to artificially raise the @xmath14 at any particular point in parameter space .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : parabola ] .",
    "a good approximation to the true ( numerical - noise free ) parabola can be found by fitting to the envelope as noise will not decrease @xmath14 .",
    "we fit for the error induced by the nine geometric parameters that we minimize over in this fashion .",
    "we fit for the error in each band separately . in all cases , we find that the @xmath30-@xmath31 error ellipse induced by the nine geometrical parameters is small compared to that induced by the photometric parameters .",
    "the two sets of error ellipses are well - aligned , differing in direction by only a few degrees .",
    "we add the resulting covariance matrices to obtain the geometric @xmath51 photometric errors .    up to this point",
    ", we have not yet taken into account the error induced by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the roughness of the @xmath14 surface is also a factor in this analysis .",
    "unfortunately , while it is theoretically possible to use the same method that we use on the other geometrical parameters , it would take several orders of magnitude more computational resources than we currently have to properly populate the geometrical figure analogous to figure  [ fig : parabola ] .",
    "we instead investigate whether and to what extent the additional error in our limb - darkening parameters induced by @xmath16 and @xmath17 will affect our conclusions .    to this end , we first define @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a vector whose components are the differences between the limb - darkening parameters of our best - fit model and a comparison model .",
    "here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the covariance matrix of the limb - darkening parameters evaluated at the best - fit model .",
    "we define equation  ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) as @xmath56 because it is the distance , expressed in @xmath14 and normalized by the error ellipsoid , between models that both attempt to describe the data .",
    "we then compare our best - fit microlens model with other microlens models over the roughly ( @xmath57 ) region of the ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) space over which @xmath14 can not be properly minimized on account of the roughness in the @xmath14 surface described in ",
    "[ sec : grid ] .",
    "we find that the limb - darkening parameters vary by less than @xmath58 . by comparison ,",
    "as we will show in  [ sec : atlas ] and  [ sec : ng ] , the limb - darkening parameters of our best - fit model differ from those predicted by the stellar models by @xmath8 . we conclude that the additional errors resulting from both the uncertainty in @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the underlying numerical noise do not affect our overall conclusions .",
    "we recognize this additional error exists , but given that we have no way to quantify it properly , we simply report the error induced by the photometric and other nine geometric parameters in table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "when we compare our limb - darkening results with the atmospheric models in  [ sec : atlas ] and  [ sec : ng ] , we wish to restrict attention to models that are relevant to the source star .",
    "we therefore begin by summarizing the results of an analysis of the source s physical properties as given by @xcite . assuming no differential reddening across the field , the dereddened color and magnitude of the source can be found by measuring the source offset from the red clump identified in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the field : ( @xmath0-@xmath3)@xmath59@xmath60 and @xmath61 . from its color and the fact that it is a giant ( see below ) , the source is a k3 iii star with a corresponding @xmath62 .",
    "the color and magnitude imply a source angular radius @xmath63as .",
    "the source - lens relative proper motion and source radial velocity imply that the source most probably lies in the bulge , i.e. , at @xmath64kpc , which implies a physical radius @xmath65 . from kinematic information ,",
    "@xcite find that while it is possible that the source lies in the far disk ( and so is physically bigger ) , it essentially can not lie in the near disk .",
    "since the source is either in the bulge , or in the far disk @xmath66pc above the plane , it must be a fairly old giant and therefore have a mass @xmath67 .",
    "the mass and radius combine to give @xmath68 .",
    "if it lies in the far disk at 12kpc then @xmath69 can be as much as 0.3 dex smaller .",
    "@xcite have analyzed hires keck spectra taken on the last two nights of the caustic crossing , hjd 2451731.953 and hjd 2451732.950 when the source center was approximately 0.25 and 0.75 source radii outside the caustic . by comparing these spectra with integrated spectra of model sources , they estimate that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and [ fe / h]@xmath72 on the first night and that @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and [ fe / h]@xmath75 on the second .",
    "the gravity is too loosely constrained in this analysis to be of any use , but fortunately we have the photometric method applied to the @xcite results given above , which is both simpler and more robust . because the source is differentially magnified while the models are not , this spectroscopic approach is not fully self - consistent .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the error induced to be modest , particularly on the first night when the limb of the star is not particularly emphasized in the integrated source light . since , in addition , both the observing conditions and s / n were substantially better the first night , we adopt @xmath70 and [ fe / h]@xmath6 as the spectroscopic determinations . the former is in excellent agreement with the photometric determinations described above . we designate ( @xmath76,[fe / h],@xmath69)=(4200k,+0.3,2.3 ) as the most physical model ( mpm ) .    if we are to use these estimates to define a viable region of model atmosphere parameter space , we need error estimates as well .",
    "spectroscopic temperature estimates are routinely good to a hundred kelvins .",
    "similarly , our photometric temperature estimate can be off by a hundred kelvins depending on differential reddening .",
    "as summarized above , the source gravity is strongly constrained by the angular - size measurement and distance estimates .",
    "one could possibly push the source into the near part of the bulge , or into the far disk , but that is all .",
    "there is also some error associated with the mass estimation , but due to age constraints the mass can not be too far from @xmath77 . to be safe ,",
    "we budget a 50% mass error .",
    "such errors give us @xmath78 in @xmath79 .",
    "the metallicity is the least well constrained .",
    "this is only a minor problem , for as we shall show in  [ sec : atlas ] and  [ sec : ng ] , metallicity has only a minor effect upon the model - atmosphere limb - darkening curves .",
    "we set our lower metallicity limit at solar .",
    "physically reasonable models ( prms ) would then be @xmath80-@xmath81 , @xmath82 - 2.7 and [ fe / h]=0.0 - + 0.3 .",
    "@xcite fits five different limb - darkening laws to a suite of atlas model atmospheres supplied to him by r. kurucz in 2000 .",
    "@xcite then reports the parameters for each of these limb - darkening laws .",
    "we compare our results to the linear + square root law , rather than the favored four - parameter fit since we also use a linear + square root law in our fitting and thus the coefficients are comparable .",
    "little is lost by this substitution as the four - parameter and two - parameter fits differ by much less than the difference between the microlensing - based and atmospheric - model profiles .",
    "we use equation  ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) to create our measure of goodness of fit , but because we are now comparing theoretical atmospheric models to what we consider a parameterization of reality , we term the result @xmath14 .",
    "[ eqn : chi2 ] implicitly assumes that the @xmath14 surface is parabolic which , since the microlensing fit is non - linear , is not strictly the case .",
    "however , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] , the covariance matrix is dominated by the linear part of the fit .",
    "hence the @xmath14 surface is nearly parabolic . as before @xmath83 is a difference in the limb - darkening parameters , this time between an atmospheric model and our microlensing result , and @xmath84 is the inverse of @xmath55 , the covariance matrix for the microlensing limb - darkening parameters .",
    "we convert the @xcite @xmath85 and @xmath86 to @xmath87 and @xmath88 using the inverse of equation  ( [ eqn : cd ] ) to make the comparison .",
    "since we have enforced @xmath89 on the microlensing models , we repeat this constraint on the atmosphere models . to do this , we determine the ( @xmath49,@xmath50 ) covariance matrix by removing the constraint @xmath89 in the microlensing fit .",
    "we then use the method given in appendix a of @xcite to enforce the constraint on the @xcite data .",
    "we restrict the comparison to the standard ( johnson - cousins ) bands , @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , because @xcite reports limb - darkening parameters only for these .",
    "following the procedure pioneered by @xcite , we begin by simultaneously comparing the microlensing limb - darkening parameters from all three filters with the atmospheric - model parameters , taking full account of the covariances among these five parameters .",
    "we restrict our investigation to those models with turbulent velocity @xmath90 only .",
    "models given by @xcite with other @xmath91 do not span the full parameter space required by our investigation , nor do we have independent information that would distinguish among different @xmath91 as we do for @xmath76 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath79 .",
    "special attention is paid to two regions of the @xmath14 surface : the neighborhood of the mpm to check for consistency between the atmospheric models and the microlens data , and features around @xmath92 ( which may not be near the mpm ) to try to guide modelers in understanding the results of their simulations .",
    "the atlas parameter grid does not contain the mpm , but the closest is @xmath70 , @xmath93 and [ m / h]@xmath6 .",
    "we shall refer to this as the mpm while within  [ sec : atlas ] .",
    "additionally , the atlas models given in @xcite have a larger grid spacing than the region covered by the prms , so we investigate @xmath94-@xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and [ m / h ] from @xmath98 to @xmath99 . we define consistency as having a @xmath100 .",
    "we find that @xmath14 at the mpm is 164 .",
    "in fact , all of the prms are high , with the @xmath14 minimum at 45 .",
    "this in itself is a major concern .",
    "that no model atmosphere agrees with our data , regardless of its parameters is evident by the fact that the @xmath101 .",

    "we find that , in all the atlas models in the vicinity of the mpm , the differences in @xmath14 between @xmath106 and @xmath97 are small compared to those induced by changes in the other two parameters .",
    "this is true for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands as well , but @xmath69 has more of an effect in the @xmath0 band . due to this lack of distinguishability , we shall focus our investigation on @xmath93 . any model whose gravity is not listed",

    "we convolve the spectra with filter functions for all five filters in the microlens data ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we then use a simple linear fit to solve for the ( @xmath87,@xmath88 ) for each filter except @xmath4 band for which we fit for @xmath88 alone .",
    "the primary difficulty in this procedure is the definition of the edge of a star .",
    "the next@xmath11gen atmospheres have a steep drop off in intensity whose location in radius varies with surface gravity .",
    "sample profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : nextgen ] .",
    "this feature can not be modeled by a linear + square root limb - darkening law , and because it contributes almost nothing to the total flux , we decide to remove it .",
    "this is further warranted because even if we had the formalism in our microlensing code to fit this feature , we would not receive any useful information since our sampling is not dense enough at the specific part of the caustic exit during which the feature would be visible .",
    "we therefore excise this feature by removing all points outside of some chosen radius .",
    "we then rescale the value of the radius at each remaining point by the factor necessary to set the outermost point s radius equal to unity .",
    "the radius is chosen by finding the point at which the @xmath4 band ( which should suffer the least amount of limb darkening ) , drops steeply off .",
    "this is something of a judgment call as individuals will pick slightly different truncation radii .",
    "this does not pose a problem , however , as tests indicate that the next@xmath11gen profile is equally well fit by a two - parameter limb - darkening law out to radii outside this steep drop off in flux ( but not into the feature we are removing ) . in the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : nextgen ]",
    ", this occurs around @xmath124 , indicating that our cut of @xmath125 is acceptable .",
    "this procedure breaks down at low surface gravity .",
    "supergiants have such a small density gradient that the surface of last scattering at different wavelengths varies greatly with radius .",
    "this would be a major concern for us if we did not have additional information telling us that this star was a luminosity class iii giant .",
    "we use a separate truncation radius at each @xmath79 , but not for each wavelength .",
    "our adopted truncation radius varies between @xmath126 at @xmath119 to @xmath127 at @xmath128 . having a single truncation radius for all bands would induce problems at the low @xmath79 end , but",
    "such low surface gravities are already highly disfavored as discussed in  [ sec : indep ] .    in performing the fit , we sample the profile at the radii corresponding to the observations ( see fig .  [ fig : fivebands ] ) , giving equal weight to each point .",
    "we evaluate the profile at these radii by interpolating among the points given by the next@xmath11gen model .",
    "this produces a model profile that is most weighted in the regions that are most densely observed in the real data .",
    "we then perform the same analysis as in ",
    "[ sec : atlas ] , creating a @xmath14 surface between the microlens limb - darkening parameters and those of the next@xmath11gen models .",
    "the only difference is that we now have nine limb - darkening parameters instead of five because we are also matching @xmath1 and @xmath2 in addition to @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as in the previous section ,",
    "no grid points in parameter space for the next@xmath11gen models coincide perfectly with the mpm , and the grid spacing does not perfectly coincide with the range of the parameters covered by the prms . in this section",
    "we will consider @xmath62 , @xmath93 and [ fe / h]@xmath6 as the mpm , and we will consider the range @xmath80 to @xmath81 , @xmath106 and @xmath97 , and [ fe / h]@xmath129 to @xmath99 as that similar to our prms .",
    "turning now to the @xmath14 analysis , the mpm is immediately ruled out : @xmath130 .",
    "the prms are also ruled out , as the lowest @xmath14 among them is 837 .",
    "when we look over the entire parameter space , we find @xmath131 at @xmath132 , @xmath93 and [ fe / h]@xmath133 . from figure",
    "[ fig : chi2ng](a ) , it appears likely that the true @xmath92 is outside of the explored parameter space , at least in @xmath76 .",
    "there also appears to be a trend towards lower metallicity , so it is possible that the best - fit metallicity is also outside our explored parameter space .",
    "we will discuss this further in  [ sec : sources ] .",
    "in general , @xmath14 increases with [ fe / h ] , and decreases with @xmath76 .",
    "surface gravities between @xmath134 and @xmath97 are preferred , with higher @xmath76 and lower metallicity selecting for a higher @xmath79 .      at the mpm ,",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands have @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively . among the prms ,",
    "all three bands prefer @xmath138 and [ fe / h]@xmath129 , though the @xmath0 and @xmath4 bands slightly prefer @xmath107 while @xmath3 band slightly prefers @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands have @xmath14 at these locations of 32 , 172 and 40 .",
    "the global minima for these bands are : @xmath0 band ) @xmath132 , @xmath139 and [ fe / h]@xmath129 with @xmath140 ; @xmath3 band ) @xmath132 , @xmath93 and [ fe / h]@xmath133 with @xmath141 ; and @xmath4 band ) @xmath132 , @xmath103 , [ fe / h]@xmath133 and @xmath142 . in sum , the all - bands and @xmath3-band minima coincide , and the @xmath14 s for bands @xmath0 and @xmath4 at the all - bands minimum is just @xmath143 higher than at their own minima . that is , all three bands have the same minimum to within @xmath144 sigma .    qualitatively , this shape of the @xmath14 surface is replicated for each individual band as can be seen from figure  [ fig : chi2ng ] .",
    "the minor differences are that the @xmath0 band surface has more curvature in @xmath76 , and @xmath4 band has more structure in @xmath79 .",
    "these two bands are in greater disagreement with the atmospheric models than any johnson - cousin band , except for @xmath132 and @xmath145 ( @xmath146 for [ fe / h]@xmath133 ) . in most cases",
    "this disagreement is much greater .",
    "the mpm has @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the best prm for both bands is @xmath138 , @xmath106 and [ fe / h]@xmath129 with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the location of the @xmath92 for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands is the same as the all - bands , at @xmath132 , @xmath93 and [ fe / h]@xmath133 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "logically , there are only four possible sources for the discrepancy between the models and the data : 1 ) problems with the microlensing data , 2 ) problems with our analysis of the data , 3 ) problems with the atmosphere models , or 4 ) incorrect comparison of the models and the data .",
    "we now argue that ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are unlikely .",
    "we test whether the data from an individual observatory drives the combined solution to an unsuitable answer .",
    "we rerun our fitting routine five times at the ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) of the combined - bands solution , each time removing a different observatory s data , the exception being that we always keep both @xmath4 band data sets .",
    "the removal of the saao , perth or eros data sets do not appreciably change the limb - darkening curves . in the @xmath0 band ,",
    "the removal of the canopus data shifts the limb - darkening parameters by approximately @xmath58 , and the removal of the yalo data shifts them by about @xmath153 .",
    "the reverse is true in the @xmath3 band , removing the canopus data provokes a @xmath153 change while removing the yalo data only induces a @xmath58 change .",
    "this test shows that any systematic effects in the data themselves are either present in data sets across all observatories , or are so mild that they do not affect the combined solution at the level of the difference between microlensing measurements and the atmospheric models .",
    "we also analyze the solutions found by the planet data and eros data separately .",
    "we expand the analysis to include searching for a solution over @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the planet - only solution is located at the same ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) as the combined solution . moreover , as discussed in  [ sec : indobs ] , removing the eros data does not appreciably change the limb - darkening profiles found by the remaining ( i.e. planet ) data .",
    "however , we find a very different result for the eros - only solution .",
    "this is located at a ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) of ( 1.94,0.77 ) that is ( 0.005,0.02 ) away from the combined solution .",
    "the eros solution has a @xmath14 75 lower than the @xmath14 of the eros bands at the combined solution .",
    "the derived stellar brightness profile is flat across the inner half of the star , then drops dramatically towards the limb .",
    "the ratio of intensities of the center to the limb are similar to that of the @xmath0 band , but the shape of the eros profiles are very different .",
    "the eros - only profiles are a much better match to the next@xmath11gen models than the eros profiles derived at the all - bands geometry .",
    "the @xmath14 of the mpm drops from 593 and 503 to 174 and 69 for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , respectively . however , the profiles from the eros - only solution are still not actually consistent with any of the next@xmath11gen models , since @xmath154 and 32 in the two eros bands .",
    "such a major inconsistency is a potentially serious problem .",
    "how can the previously described disagreement between atmospheric models and microlensing be trusted if the microlensing can produce such different fits ?",
    "we argue that this problem can be resolved in the following manner : 1 ) we identify the feature that has the most diagnostic power with regards to the limb darkening : the caustic exit , 2 ) we show how the eros datasets do not well determine this feature , though the combination of eros and saao @xmath4 band datasets do , and 3 ) we investigate whether the large formal difference in @xmath14 between the eros and all - bands geometries represent a failing of the model or of the data , and what the consequences of that failure are .",
    "we first examine the region from which we receive the most information about the limb darkening : near the caustic exit .",
    "this region is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "an accurate estimate of the caustic - exit time is essential for determining the amount of darkening on the extreme limb .",
    "this can be illustrated by thinking of data points just outside of the true caustic exit .",
    "if the caustic exit were thought to occur later than it actually does , these points would be thought to be inside of the caustic .",
    "their faintness would therefore imply that the part of the star undergoing the strongest differential magnification ( the limb ) had very low surface brightness . on the other hand ,",
    "if the caustic exit is recognized to occur before these points , their faintness is properly attributed to the fact that there are no additional images of the source , i.e. the source lies entirely outside the caustic .",
    "this is exactly the issue with respect to the disagreement between the planet - only and eros - only geometries . as figure  [ fig : lc ] shows , the eros - only geometry places the caustic exit at a later time , which implies greater limb darkening .",
    "we therefore investigate how well the caustic - exit time is determined by the all - bands data set and what the source of this discrepancy is .",
    "first we note that the time of the caustic exit is essentially determined from the combination of the saao @xmath4 band data and the eros data : the @xmath4 band data show an approximately linear fall toward the caustic exit , and this fall must break very close to the best - fit caustic exit if the magnification curve is to remain continuous and still pass through the eros @xmath2 points .",
    "see figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "thus , the caustic - exit time can be specified virtually without reference to any model .    even if the eros points are eliminated from the fit , the best - fit light curve based on planet - only data still passes through these eros points and intersects the linearly - falling saao @xmath4 band lightcurve at almost exactly the same caustic exit . because the planet points that fix the post - exit magnification start up about 10 hours after the exit when the magnification has already started to rise , this determination of the caustic exit is somewhat model - dependent .",
    "however , the model dependence is quite weak .",
    "hence , we have two independent and robust lines of evidence fixing the caustic - exit time , and for this reason we have high confidence in the result .    nevertheless , it remains somewhat puzzling why the eros - only solution prefers a later time . from figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , it is clear that the eros data near the caustic exit do not themselves strongly prefer one solution over the other .",
    "hence , this discrepancy must be rooted in other parts of the light curve : either the eros data have systematic errors elsewhere in the light curve , or the model does not exactly reproduce the true lightcurve .    to distinguish between these possibilities , we first exclude the @xmath4 band data and refit the lightcurve .",
    "the result is shown by the blue line in figure  [ fig : lc ] , which is between the eros - only solution and the planet - only solution .",
    "clearly the pressure toward a late caustic exit is not coming from the eros data alone . to verify this , we eliminate the @xmath4 band , the remaining saao bands , and the eros data .",
    "the resulting exit , which lies almost on top of the blue line of the minus @xmath4 band geometry , also lies half way between the planet - only and eros - only values .",
    "since the problem is not restricted to one data set , we conclude that the model must imperfectly predict the data elsewhere in the lightcurve .",
    "we have attempted to isolate this discrepancy using various techniques , but have not succeeded because the effect is extremely small and only manifests itself when data far from the caustic exit are used to predict the caustic - exit time . as with any such extrapolation , and caustic - exit predictions in particular @xcite , small errors can be vastly magnified when predicting distant effects .",
    "we must also determine how much the fit to the caustic region ( and so the limb - darkening measurement ) is being distorted on account of data far away .",
    "to do so , we decrease the error by a factor of ten on the group of @xmath4 band points just before the caustic exit .",
    "this should increase the relative importance of this region to the overall fit and be able to tell us to what extent the light curve near the caustic exit is being influenced by data far away .",
    "the caustic exit shifts slightly to an earlier time , as we should expect given that data far from the caustic tends to shift it to later times .",
    "this shift , however , does not produce substantial changes in the limb - darkening curves , shifting them by 1 - 1.5@xmath155 on average . we conclude that the caustic exit is very well determined , and the discrepancies related to it do not significantly affect the limb - darkening determinations .",
    "it is unlikely that our fitting routine is the source of the conflict .",
    "we fit all the data simultaneously , so one would expect any systematic effects would have to be present in all bands .",
    "the limb - darkening curves in these five bands are all internally consistent with each other . without outside information ,",
    "the microlensing routine found that the amount of limb darkening increases with decreasing wavelength , starting from a very flat profile in @xmath4 band and progressing through @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 to a relatively steep @xmath0 band profile ( see fig .  [ fig : fivebands ] ) .",
    "even the relative amounts of limb darkening are roughly correct .",
    "the mean wavelength of the @xmath2 band is @xmath156 of the way between that of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 bands @xcite , and indeed , the @xmath2 band limb - darkening profile is very similar to the @xmath3 band profile . the mean wavelength of the @xmath1 band is @xmath157 of the way between @xmath0 and @xmath3 @xcite , and the @xmath1 profile is more like the @xmath0 band profile than the @xmath3 band profile , as expected the degree of similarity between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 profiles does not match that between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ibandat ] compares the @xmath3 band limb darkening derived from microlensing to a suite of atlas atmospheric models all at the same @xmath93 and [ m / h]@xmath6 , but with different temperatures .",
    "a striking feature of this figure is that all of the atmospheric models go through a single point , one which the microlensing model does not go through .",
    "note that the curve for the sun ( the only star in the sky with better measured limb darkening than eros blg-2000 - 5 ) also passes through this point .",
    "that is , the models all carry a common feature that is also present in the sun , but does not exist in the giant eros blg-2000 - 5 .",
    "this exact feature is also present in the next@xmath11gen models shown in figure  [ fig : ibandng ] .",
    "we conjecture that these models , which are capable of producing fits to the sun , incorporate physics that is only applicable in the solar regime .",
    "this common feature is not apparent when the limb - darkening curves are normalized in the usual ( @xmath85,@xmath86 ) formalism .",
    "it appears only when limb - darkening curves are plotted to conserve total flux as in equation  ( [ eqn : limblaw ] ) . in any event",
    ", this feature gives an easily identifiable handle on the difference between the limb darkening of the models and the limb darkening observed via microlensing .",
    "the @xmath14 surfaces for the atlas and next@xmath11gen models are shown in figures  [ fig : chi2at ] and [ fig : chi2ng ] . as there are three input parameters , @xmath76 , @xmath79 and metallicity for each model",
    ", we hold the least important constant , and show @xmath14 versus the other two .",
    "this results in two fairly similarly looking surfaces . in both cases",
    ", @xmath76 is the most important parameter in determining @xmath14 with the metallicity and surface gravity playing far more subordinate roles .",
    "additionally , while the true @xmath92 for the next@xmath11gen models is beyond the range in parameter space we investigated , the flattening of the @xmath14 surface indicates that it is not very far away . both the atlas and the next@xmath11gen models are most consistent with a star of @xmath158 , @xmath93 - 3.0 and metallicity around @xmath159 .      as we have just shown in ",
    "[ sec : models ] , the atmospheric models both seem to prefer a k1 star .",
    "it is therefore important to ask if our observations are biased and we are expecting the wrong type of star . in principle , differential extinction across the field could redden the star more than the clump stars against which it is calibrated ( see fig.10 of @xcite ) , thus affecting our photometric estimate of its intrinsic color .",
    "however , the spectroscopic analysis yields a source temperature similar to the one we find photometrically .    one should note that reddening has the effect of shifting the observed bands .",
    "we find , however , that the measured extinction for eros blg-2000 - 5  [ @xmath160(@xmath0-@xmath3)=1.3 ] shifts the mean wavelength of the @xmath3 bandpass by only @xmath161 .",
    "this shift is about @xmath162 of the difference between the mean wavelengths of @xmath3 and @xmath2 and only @xmath163 of the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath0 . comparing figures  [ fig : ibandat ] and [ fig : fivebands ]",
    ", one sees that it can not account for differences between the observations and the atmospheric models .",
    "this is partly because the magnitude of the effect is too small , and partly because it causes a shift in the wrong direction .",
    "the observational limb darkening found from microlensing formally disagrees with the limb darkening derived from atmospheric models by many sigma .",
    "we have argued that this difference is unlikely to be the result of the observations , but is more likely due to something related to the atmospheric models .",
    "it is possible that these models include physics that is not applicable in all surface - gravity regimes .",
    "it is a testament to the theoretical models that they approximate reality in several bands without any previous physical data .",
    "we hope that now that giant stars have a calibration point , much like dwarfs have from the sun and supergiants have from interferometry , stellar models can continue to improve in all stellar regimes .",
