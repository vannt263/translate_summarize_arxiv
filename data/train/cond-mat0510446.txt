    "the analytic structure of the bloch functions for 1d crystals with inversion symmetry was investigated in ref .  .",
    "among the major conclusions of this paper , is the fact that the entire band structure can be characterized by a single , though multi - valued , analytic function @xmath11[@xmath14 , with branch points that occur at complex @xmath15 .",
    "a similar conclusion holds also for the bloch functions .",
    "the positions of the branch points determine the exponential decay of the wannier functions .",
    "for insulators , they also determine the exponential decay of the density matrix and other correlation functions .",
    "it was recently shown that the order of the branch points determines the additional inverse power law decay of these functions.@xcite we can say that , although the branch points occur at complex @xmath15 , their existence and location have very important implications on the properties and dynamics of the physical states .",
    "the complex @xmath15 wavefunctions are also important when describing surface and defect states , metal - insulator junctions and electrical transport across finite crystals and linear molecular chains.@xcite    the methods developed in ref .   could not be extended to higher dimensions , where the results are much more limited .",
    "the first major step here was made by des cloizeaux , who studied the analytic structure near real @xmath16s , for crystals with a center of inversion.@xcite his conclusion was that the bloch functions and energies of an isolated simple band are analytic ( and periodic ) in a complex strip around the real @xmath16s .",
    "the restriction to crystals with center of symmetry was later removed.@xcite the analytic structure has been reconsidered in a study by avron and simon,@xcite who gave answers to some important , tough qualitative questions .",
    "for example , one of their conclusion was that all isolated singularities of the band energy are algebraic branch points .",
    "the topology of the riemann surface of the bloch functions for finite gap potentials in two dimensions has been investigated in a series of studies by novikov et al.@xcite the analytic structure has been also investigated by purely numerical methods . since it is impossible to explore numerically the entire complex plane , numerical methods can not provide the global structure .",
    "even so , they can provide valuable information .",
    "for example , in the complex band calculations for si,@xcite or linear molecular chains,@xcite one can clearly see how the bands are connected , even though these studies explored only the real axis of the complex energy plane .    in this paper",
    "we consider linear molecular chains , described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath17 with @xmath1 periodic with respect to one of the cartesian coordinates of @xmath18 , let us say @xmath2 : @xmath19 the wavefunctions of @xmath4 are bloch waves , @xmath5 , with the fundamental property @xmath20 we derive the generic analytic structure ( the riemann surface ) of @xmath5 and of the corresponding energy @xmath8 as functions of complex @xmath9 .",
    "we shall see that they are different branches of two analytic functions , @xmath21 and @xmath11 , with an essential singularity at @xmath13 and additional branch points which , generically , are of order 3 , respectively 1 .",
    "we show where this branch points come from , how they move when the potential is changed and , in some cases , how to estimate their location .",
    "our strategy is as follows . according to bloch theorem",
    ", we can restrict @xmath2 to @xmath22 $ ] and study the following class of hamiltonians , which will be called bloch hamiltonians : @xmath23,\\ ] ] with @xmath9 referring to the following boundary conditions : @xmath24 which define the domain of @xmath25 . for @xmath22 $ ]",
    ", the eigenvectors of @xmath25 and their corresponding energies coincide with @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the resolvent set of @xmath25 , which is composed of those points in the complex energy plane for which @xmath27 is bounded .",
    "now , it was long known that the green s function , @xmath27 , evaluated at some arbitrary point @xmath28 , is analytic of @xmath9 , for any @xmath9 in the complex plane.@xcite in section ii , we derive the local analytic structure of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues as functions of @xmath9 , starting from this observation alone . to obtain the global analytic structure , we start with a simple @xmath1 , with known global analytic structure , and then study how this structure changes when @xmath1 is modified .    when this formalism is applied to 1d periodic systems , all the conclusions ( and a few additional ones ) of ref .   follow with no extra effort .",
    "this is done in section iii .",
    "section iv presents the results for linear chains .",
    "we have two applications : a compact expression for the green s function , which is developed in section v , and the computation of the asymptotic behavior of the density matrix for insulating linear molecular chains , which is done in section vi .",
    "we conclude with remarks on how to calculate the analytic structure for real systems .",
    "we also have two appendices with mathematical details .",
    "we consider here , at a general and abstract level , an analytic family , @xmath29 , of closed , possibly non selfadjoint operators . the analyticity is considered in the sense of kato,@xcite which means that",
    ", for any @xmath28 , the green s function can be expanded as @xmath30 with the power series converging in the topology induced by the operator norm , for any @xmath31 in a finite vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "we have already mentioned that the bloch hamiltonians form an analytic family .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss the analytic structure of the eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors of @xmath25 , as functions of @xmath9 , based solely on the analyticity of the green s function . for this",
    ", we need to find ways of expressing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using only the green s function .",
    "the major challenge will be posed by the degeneracies .",
    "suppose @xmath32 has an isolated , non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath33 , for @xmath9 near @xmath34 .",
    "then there exists a closed contour @xmath35 separating @xmath36 from the rest of the spectrum . for @xmath9 in a sufficiently small vicinity of @xmath34",
    ", @xmath37 remains the only eigenvalue inside @xmath35 and we can express @xmath33 as @xmath38 as shown in appendix a , eqs .",
    "( [ kato ] ) and ( [ formula1 ] ) automatically imply that @xmath37 is analytic at @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath34 was chosen arbitrarily , we can conclude that the non - degenerate eigenvalues are analytic functions of @xmath9 , as long as they stay isolated from the rest of the spectrum .    ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath39 , that become equal for @xmath40 .",
    "the figure also shows the contours of integration , @xmath35 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 used in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    suppose now that @xmath25 has two isolated , non - degenerate eigenvalues , @xmath37 and @xmath43 , which become equal at some @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath45 we are interested in the analytic structure of these eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors , for @xmath9 in a vicinity of @xmath44 .",
    "( [ formula1 ] ) is no longer useful , since there is no such @xmath9-independent contour @xmath35 that isolates one eigenvalue from the rest of the spectrum , for all @xmath9 in a vicinity of @xmath44 .",
    "the key is to work with both eigenvalues , since we can still find a @xmath9-independent contour @xmath35 , separating @xmath37 and @xmath39 from the rest of the spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) , as long as @xmath9 stays in a sufficiently small vicinity of @xmath44 .",
    "we define , @xmath46 the main observation is that we can use the green s function to express @xmath47 : @xmath48 then , as shown in appendix a , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ kato ] ) and ( [ formula2 ] ) that @xmath47 are analytic functions near and at @xmath44 .",

    "the analytic function , @xmath50 must have a zero at @xmath44 , so its generic behavior near @xmath44 is @xmath51 with @xmath52 an integer larger or equal to 1 and @xmath53 analytic and non - zero at @xmath44 .",
    "the cases when @xmath54 are very special and will not be considered here .",
    "only the following two possibilities are relevant to us : @xmath55 where @xmath53 is analytic and has no zeros in a vicinity of @xmath44 .    for a type i degeneracy , as @xmath9 loops around @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath37 becomes @xmath56 and vice versa .",
    "the two eigenvalues are different branches of a double - valued analytic function , with a branch point of order 1 at @xmath44 : @xmath57    for a type ii degeneracy , both @xmath37 and @xmath58 are analytic near @xmath44 .",
    "we consieder now the spectral projectors , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , associated with @xmath37 and @xmath58 , respectively . for @xmath61 , they have the following representation : @xmath62 where @xmath41 is defined by @xmath63 , with @xmath64 small enough ( thus @xmath9",
    "dependent ) so @xmath58 lies outside @xmath41 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xmath60 has a completely equivalent representation .",
    "we list the following properties : @xmath65    for a type i degeneracy , as @xmath9 loops around @xmath44 , @xmath59 becomes @xmath66 and vice versa .",
    "thus , @xmath59 and @xmath66 are different branches of a double - valued analytic function , with branch point of order 1 at @xmath44 . in other words ,",
    "they are given by the same function ( identified from now on with @xmath59 ) , which is evaluated on different riemann sheets .",
    "these sheets have @xmath44 as a common point .",
    "thus , if @xmath59 does not diverge at @xmath44 , then @xmath67 but this will contradict , for example , @xmath68 . we must conclude that @xmath59 diverges at @xmath44 . to find out the form of the singularity , we observe that , if @xmath69 denotes the difference @xmath70 , then @xmath71 has a well defined limit at @xmath44 , which can be seen from the following representation : @xmath72 since @xmath73 , we can conclude that the singularity of @xmath59 is of the form @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , we mention that the total spectral projector , @xmath75 is analytic near and at @xmath44 , as it can be seen from the representation @xmath76 and that the green function for @xmath40 and @xmath2 near @xmath77 has the following structure : @xmath78 with @xmath79 analytic near @xmath77 .",
    "this expression is interesting because the green s function of self - adjoint operators , viewed as functions of @xmath2 , always have simple poles .",
    "thus , @xmath80 can not be a self - adjoint operator .",
    "in other words , type i degeneracies can not occur for those values of @xmath9 for which @xmath25 is self - adjoint .",
    "we now turn our attention to the eigenvectors . since",
    ", for @xmath61 , @xmath59 is rank one , it can be written as @xmath81 with @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) the eigenvector to the left ( right ) , normalized as @xmath84 as explained in ref .",
    ", passing from the projector to the eigenvectors is not a trivial matter , since these vectors are defined up to a phase factor .",
    "the question is , can we choose or define these phases so that no additional singularities are introduced ? we can give a positive answer when there is an anti - unitary transformation , @xmath85 , such that : @xmath86 as we shall later see , such @xmath85 exists , for example , when @xmath87 .",
    "now fix an arbitrary @xmath88 and observe that @xmath89 one immediate problem with the above expression is that the denominator can be zero .",
    "this can happen only for isolated values of @xmath9 for , otherwise , the denominator will be identically zero .",
    "let @xmath34 be such value , assumed different from the branch point ( we can always choose a @xmath88 satisfying this condition ) . we know that the only singularity of @xmath59 is at @xmath44 ,",
    "so what we have is two functions that are equal on a domain surrounding @xmath34 but excluding @xmath34 , and one of them , @xmath59 , is analytic at @xmath34 .",
    "then it is a fact that both functions are analytic at @xmath34 .",
    "this means the numerator in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ proj ] ) must also cancel at @xmath34 , with the same power as the denominator and the problem disappears .",

    "you may think that , in such cases , we should modify the denominator of @xmath82 to @xmath100 .",
    "the problem is that @xmath34 is not unique so this may fix the problem at @xmath34 but not at other similar points .",

    "we can repeat the same arguments for arbitrary @xmath52 and the conclusion will be the same : @xmath109 with @xmath53 and @xmath110 analytic and non - zero near @xmath34 .",
