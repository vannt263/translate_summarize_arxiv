    "functions of bounded variation have important applications in many branches of mathematical physics , among them optimization  @xcite free - discontinuity problems  @xcite ( this and the previous reference also contains good introductions to the theory of bv functions ) and hyperbolic systems of conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "however , the theory of numerical approximations of such functions is not very well developed and indeed , because of the nature of singularities of bv functions , deeper analytical insight is requried . in this work",
    "we aim to contribute to such insight by considering the basic question whether bv function can be approximated well by ( countably ) piecewise affine functions .",
    "before we start our investigation , though , we remark that any good approximation by piecewise - constant functions must fail , even though such functions of course lie in bv , this will be shown in proposition  [ prop : no_const_approx ] below .    for @xmath3 an integer ,",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "it is well - known that the space of piecewise affine functions with countably many pieces is ( norm-)dense in @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "such a result is interesting for example in proving lower semicontinuity theorems , see for example  @xcite .",
    "such an approximation result is also easily seen to be true in the space bv of functions of bounded variation , if we switch from norm convergence to the so - called strict convergence ( see below ) .    for some applications",
    ", however , one needs a better approximation result , in which also the trace differences over the boundaries of the mesh are controlled . this need becomes immediately obvious for example in the analysis of energy functionals in free - discontinuity problems , which typically involve a term measuring jumps over the discontinuity surface ( see for example  @xcite ) , and where , to produce good approximants , one needs to control the `` jump error '' .",
    "consequently , the purpose of this note is to prove the following approximation theorem , related to a weaker result in  @xcite and numerical and analytical studies  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : approx ] let @xmath4 be a bounded lipschitz domain and @xmath7 . then",
    ", for every @xmath8 there exist a countable family @xmath9 of ( rotated ) rectangles and simplices @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the following properties :    * the sets in @xmath9 are non - overlapping and @xmath12 .",
    "* for each @xmath13 the restriction @xmath14 is affine .",
    "* @xmath15 .",
    "* @xmath16 . * @xmath17 .    here , if @xmath18 is the lebesgue ",

    "the latter convergence is the `` natural '' replacement for the strong convergence in @xmath28 since smooth functions are @xmath26-strictly but not strongly dense in @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , we even have the following stronger result ( see lemma  1 of  @xcite or lemma  b.1 in  @xcite for a proof under additional assumptions ) :    [ lem : smooth_approx ] let @xmath4 be a nonempty bounded and open set ( no regularity assumption is imposed on @xmath29 ) and let @xmath7",
    ". there exists a sequence @xmath30 such that @xmath31 if @xmath32 , then we can in addition arrange that @xmath33 strongly in @xmath34 .",
    "many reasonable integral functionals with linear growth are continuous with respect to the @xmath26-strict convergence by reshetnyak s continuity theorem  @xcite and extensions , see for example theorem  4 and the appendix of  @xcite ; lower semicontinuity in this situation is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "for some special examples of positively @xmath35-homogeneous integrands see  @xcite .",
    "thus , the main result of this paper establishes density of ( countably ) piecewise affine functions in bv in the strict sense and such that additionally conditions ( iv ) , ( v ) are satisfied .",
    "we remark that it is easy to satisfy conditions ( i)(iii ) of theorem  [ thm : approx ] by simply mollifying @xmath36 , which gives a strictly close smooth function ( by lemma  [ lem : smooth_approx ] ) and then strongly approximating this smooth function by a piecewise affine function .",
    "unfortunately , on this route one loses control of the sum of integrals in ( iv ) , and it is precisely this condition , which is important for instance in applications to free - dicontinuity problems .    in the course of the proof of the above theorem , we will rely on a result about approximations in @xmath37 , which we factor out for its independent interest , see theorem  [ thm : lagrange_w11 ] : it tells us that in @xmath37 , we can prove actual approximation _",
    "error bounds _ for _ any _ mesh , with the error bound depending only the @xmath38-modulus of continuity of the weak gradient of the approximated function and regularity / uniformity constants of the mesh . hence , in norm - compact subsets of @xmath37 we get a uniform rate of convergence .",
    "we finally point out that the corresponding result for approximation by pure jump functions , that is , ( countably ) piecewise constant functions is not true  this also gives another reason why condition ( iv ) in theorem  [ thm : approx ] is of interest :    [ prop : no_const_approx ] let @xmath39 be a natural number and assume that @xmath40 is not identically zero",
    ". then there can be no sequence of piecewise constant maps @xmath41 such that @xmath42 @xmath26-strictly in @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be any continuous integrand satisfying @xmath45 on @xmath46 , which is a bounded set by assumption , and @xmath47 for large values of @xmath48 , hence @xmath49 . if @xmath50 were piecewise constant @xmath43 functions such that @xmath42 @xmath26-strictly in @xmath43 , then by reshetnyak s continuity theorem  @xcite ( also see  @xcite and the appendix of  @xcite ) , we would have @xmath51 and , since @xmath52 , @xmath53 where both convergences are weak * in @xmath54 . but",
    "this is clearly impossible because @xmath55 .    for the usual strict convergence ,",
    "consider the continuous and positively @xmath35-homogeneous integrand @xmath56 then , for any @xmath57 strictly in @xmath58 , reshetnyak s ( original ) continuity theorem implies @xmath59 however , if the @xmath50 s are pure jump functions , then @xmath60 @xmath61-almost everywhere , but @xmath62 is zero on the rank - one cone , and hence @xmath63 as a measure would follow , which clearly is not generally true .",
    "thus it is not possible to approximate @xmath36 with @xmath64 by piecewise constant functions .",
    "this observation should be contrasted with the case of real - valued bv - functions ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) and the usual strict convergence , where a discretisation of the coarea formula allows approximation by piecewise constant functions , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3 ) .    finally , we note the following connection to quasiconvexity theory : assume for a moment that we could find a piecewise constant sequence @xmath66 strictly ( @xmath67 and zero boundary values ) and that there exists a positively @xmath35-homogeneous rank - one convex , but not quasiconvex function @xmath68 . then , by reshetnyak s theorem and the fact that @xmath69-a.e .",
    "it holds that @xmath70 , @xmath71 but then @xmath62 must be quasiconvex as well , a contradiction !",
    "the authors wish to thank nicola fusco and endre sli for discussions related to the subject of this paper .",
    "let @xmath72 be a @xmath73-dimensional simplex in @xmath74 , that is , @xmath72 is the convex hull of @xmath75 affinely independent points @xmath76 of @xmath74 ( the vertices of @xmath72 ) .",
    "each point @xmath77 admits a unique representation ( the barycentric representation ) as a convex combination of the vertices of @xmath72 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 , are affine functions with @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 is a continuous mapping , then the lagrange interpolation of @xmath83 on @xmath72 is the ( unique ) affine mapping @xmath84 that agrees with @xmath83 at the vertices of @xmath72 . using the @xmath85 s , it can be written as @xmath86    [ lem : lagrange_est ] there exists a constant @xmath87 , only depending on the dimensions , with the following property : assume that @xmath88 is a @xmath89 mapping with lagrange interpolant @xmath90 on @xmath72 .",
    "then , @xmath91    we start from the formula @xmath92 which is a consequence of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 consequently , we find @xmath95 where we used ( an elementary version of ) the coarea formula for the last equality . now , for fixed @xmath96 we change variables via @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , for which we can estimate @xmath100 since @xmath101 .",
