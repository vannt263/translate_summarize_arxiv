    "the analysis of nuclear spectra has produced ample evidence for chaotic motion . indeed , near neutron threshold , the spectra of medium  weight and heavy nuclei display fluctuations which agree with those of random matrices drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite .",
    "similar agreement has been found for nuclei in the @xmath0shell ( both in experimental data  @xcite and in shell  model calculations  @xcite ) , and in the ground  state domain of heavier nuclei  @xcite , although here there exists strong evidence , too , for regular motion as predicted by the shell model and the collective models . calculations in ce  @xcite have produced similar evidence for chaotic motion in atoms .",
    "thus , chaos appears to be an ubiquitous feature of interacting many ",
    "body systems . what is the origin of this behavior ? in the present paper , we address aspects of this question .",
    "we do so using the nuclear shell model , a theory with a mean field and a residual two  body effective interaction @xmath1 .",
    "( we do not include three  body forces , although there is evidence  @xcite that these may be needed to attain quantitative agreement with data .",
    "it will be seen that qualitatively , our arguments would not change with the inclusion of such forces . ) in many nuclei , the mean field is ( nearly ) spherically symmetric .",
    "thus , single ",
    "particle motion is largely regular .",
    "chaos in nuclei seems a generic property and , hence , must be due to @xmath1 .",
    "we focus attention entirely upon the effects of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we assume that we deal with a single major shell in which the single  particle states are completely degenerate and in which there is a fixed number of valence nucleons .",
    "( a lack of complete degeneracy would reduce the mixing of states due to @xmath1 and , thus , drive the system towards regular motion ) .",
    "generic results are expected to be independent of the details of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the two  body matrix elements ( tbme ) of @xmath1 are uncorrelated gaussian  distributed random variables with zero mean value and unit variance .",
    "our results then apply to almost all two  body interactions with the exception of a set of measure zero .",
    "( the integration measure is the volume element in the parameter space of the tbme . )",
    "the resulting random  matrix model is commonly referred to as the two  body random ensemble ( tbre )  @xcite .",
    "we ask : how does @xmath1 produce chaos in the framework of the tbre ?    the two ",
    "body interaction @xmath1 has two characteristic features .",
    "( i ) it connects pairs of nucleons .",
    "( ii ) it possesses symmetries : it conserves spin , isospin , and parity .",
    "we wish to elucidate the role of both features in producing chaos in nuclei .",
    "the relevance of the first feature is brought out by comparing the tbre with the goe .",
    "we recall that in the latter , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian couple every state in hilbert space to every other such state .",
    "these matrix elements are assumed to be uncorrelated random variables . in the context of many ",
    "body theory , such independent couplings between all pairs of states can be realized only in terms of a many ",
    "body interaction the rank of which equals the number of valence particles . put differently , with @xmath2 the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix ,",
    "the number of independent random variables in the goe is @xmath3 and , for @xmath4 , grows much faster than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is intuitively clear that the goe hamiltonian will produce a thorough mixing of the basis states which is tantamount to chaos . in contradistinction , the number of independent two  body matrix elements in a single shell with half ",
    "integer spin @xmath5 is only @xmath6 while the number of many  body states with fixed total spin @xmath7 grows with @xmath5 like @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of valence particles .",
    "( the simple estimates leading to these statements are given in the appendix .",
    "the statements apply for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , in the tbre the number of independent random variables is much smaller than the dimension of typical matrix spaces , and it is a non  trivial fact that @xmath1 produces as much mixing of the basis states as the goe hamiltonian .",
    "we wish to elucidate the mechanism which is responsible for this mixing .    as for the second feature ( the role of symmetries )",
    ", we compare the tbre with another random  matrix model which lacks the symmetries of the tbre but likewise assumes a random two  body interaction .",
    "this is the embedded two  body ensemble of gaussian orthogonal random matrices ( egoe(2 ) )  @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "@xmath9 fermions are distributed over @xmath12 degenerate single  particle states .",
    "hilbert space is spanned by the resulting @xmath13 slater determinants . the two ",
    "body interaction connects only those slater determinants which differ in the occupation numbers of not more than two single  particle states .",
    "therefore , the representation of the two  body interaction in the hilbert space of slater determinants yields a sparse matrix ( most non  diagonal matrix elements vanish ) .",
    "this model does not respect the symmetries of the shell model .",
    "neither the single  particle states nor the two ",
    "body interaction carry any quantum numbers . obviously , the model is very different from the goe .",
    "it is likewise very different from the tbre . in the latter , the single  particle states",
    "do carry spin , isospin , and parity quantum numbers , and @xmath1 conserves these symmetries .",
    "total hilbert space decays into orthogonal subspaces carrying these same quantum numbers .",
    "each subspace is spanned by states which are linear combinations of ( many ) slater determinants . as a result ,",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath1 in any such subspace becomes fairly dense , even though it remains true that @xmath1 connects only slater determinants which differ in the occupation numbers of not more than two single  particle states .    in comparing the egoe(2 ) and the tbre",
    ", one may consider several options .",
    "( i ) one might use the fixed hilbert space of all many ",
    "body states that exist within a given major shell , with all possible quantum numbers for total spin , parity , and isospin .",
    "these states are coupled either via a symmetry  preserving random interaction ( this is the tbre ; here the hamiltonian has block  diagonal structure ) , or via a symmetry  breaking random interaction ( this is the egoe(2 ) ) . one might compare the spectral statistics of the eigenvalues and the mixing of the eigenfunctions in both models . at this point in time , such a comparison is impractical because of the huge dimension of the matrices involved for the egoe(2 ) .",
    "( ii ) one might use a hilbert space of many ",
    "body states with fixed values for total spin , parity and isospin .",
    "these states are coupled again either via a symmetry  preserving random interaction ( this is the tbre within the subspace of many ",
    "body states with fixed quantum numbers ) or , in the case of a symmetry  breaking interaction , via effective interactions that take into account the coupling to many ",
    "body states with different quantum numbers . here",
    "the construction of the effective interaction poses severe difficulties and is practically impossible for realistic cases . both options ( i ) and ( ii ) ask questions relating to the physical role of conserved quantum numbers in the shell model . even if these options were open , we would probably not have used them .",
    "the aim of this paper is different .",
    "we wish to elucidate the mechanisms which are operative in different random  matrix models ( goe , egoe(2 ) , tbre ) in generating chaos .",
    "this is why we have followed option ( iii ) : the role of symmetries can also be displayed by comparing the structure of the hamiltonian matrices which are typical for the tbre and the egoe(2 ) , in both cases for hilbert spaces of large dimensions .",
    "this option does not require the diagonalization of huge matrices or the difficult construction of effective interactions .",
    "it dodges the issue of the physical role of symmetry in shell  model calculations and focusses instead upon the structural aspects of the matrices involved in the two approaches .    in section  [ abs ]",
    "we elucidate the structural features of the egoe(2 ) . in section  [ pres ]",
    "we then turn to a corresponding analysis for the tbre in the case of a single @xmath5shell , and of the @xmath0shell . for both models we aim at displaying those structural elements which are absent in the goe and which are essential for producing a thorough mixing of the basis states in hilbert space and , thus , chaos , in spite of a strongly reduced number of independent random variables .",
    "the comparison between the egoe(2 ) and the tbre will then display the role of symmetries in the tbre .",
    "( this aspect of the tbre has been coined `` geometric chaoticity '' by zelevinsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , the actual role of symmetries in the tbre has never been investigated . )",
    "we are led to the conclusion , that symmetries are a vital element of the tbre and , in this sense , instrumental in producing chaos in nuclei .",
    "we are aware of a huge body of literature addressing issues closely related to our theme .",
    "some of these are reviewed in refs .",
    "as mentioned above , there is ample evidence for chaos in nuclear shell ",
    "model calculations in the @xmath0shell and beyond .",
    "likewise , there is evidence for chaos in the egoe(2 ) , at least in the center of the spectrum .",
    "even deviations from complete chaos have been understood since a long time . as early as 1979 , it was , f.i .",
    ", shown  @xcite that the non  degeneracy of the single  particle states in the @xmath0shell prevents a complete mixing of all the states of given total spin and causes the partial width amplitudes ( given as projections of the eigenstates of the shell  model hamiltonian onto a fixed vector in hilbert space ) to deviate from the porter  thomas distribution predicted by the goe .",
    "we are not concerned with adding to this impressive body of evidence .",
    "we take it for granted that chaos exists in the shell model and in the egoe(2 ) .",
    "rather , we wish to understand the structural aspects of the tbre and of the egoe which produce chaos .",
    "we believe that our investigation offers novel insights into the origin of chaos in nuclei in the following two respects : ( i ) we demonstrate that chaos is generic and ubiquitous both in a single @xmath5shell and in the @xmath0shell . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "previous arguments have always relied upon numerical results based upon a _ specific _ choice of the two  body interaction . in contradistinction",
    ", we use _ generic _ aspects of the tbre to show that we must always expect strong mixing of the basis states .",
    "( ii ) we exhibit the role played by symmetries in the tbre for the generation of chaos by comparing this ensemble with the egoe(2 ) , and with the goe . we are not aware of any previous work on this topic",
    ".    our emphasis on the role of symmetry in generating chaos may be surprising .",
    "in fact , the existence of a complete set of quantum numbers ( usually connected to symmetries of the hamiltonian ) is equivalent to integrability and , thus , diametrically opposed to chaos .",
    "the case of nuclei ( and , for that matter , of atoms ) is different .",
    "the symmetries that dominate nuclei ( invariance under rotation , mirror reflection , and proton  neutron exchange ) are incomplete ( they do not form a complete set of integrals of the motion ) . taking account of these symmetries , we can write the hamiltonian in block  diagonal form .",
    "chaotic motion does seem to exist in every such block .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to ask : in which way is the origin of chaos influenced by the presence such an incomplete set of quantum numbers ? it is this question which we answer by comparing the tbre with the egoe(2 ) and the goe .",
    "in this section , we analyse the egoe(2 ) and then compare it with the goe . in the absence of symmetries , the appropriate random two ",
    "body interaction model is the egoe(2 ) .",
    "the egoe(2 ) is often used to model stochastic aspects of realistic systems like small metallic grains or quantum dots .",
    "this is justified since in those systems the single  particle wave functions themselves are chaotic , and the resulting two  body matrix elements reflect this property and transport the information of the underlying one  body chaos into the many  body system . several numerical studies for matrix dimensions up to a few thousand or so have shown that the egoe(2 ) exhibits goe statistics in the center of the spectrum . for infinite matrix dimensions ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "evidence from previous work on the egoe(2 )  @xcite suggests that the level statistics is poissonian .",
    "however , no firm conclusion has yet been reached  @xcite . here ,",
    "we supplement the previous analysis by a different approach and focus on the matrix structure . in the egoe(2 ) , the random variables are the @xmath14/2 $ ] independent two  body matrix elements @xmath15 .",
    "a hamiltonian drawn from the egoe(2 ) has matrix elements [ hamegoe ] h_=_=1^a v_d _ ( )  , where the matrices @xmath16 transport the information contained in the two  body matrix elements @xmath17 into the @xmath2dimensional hilbert space spanned by slater determinants labeled @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the matrices @xmath20 play a central role in the understanding of the egoe(2 ) .",
    "indeed , these matrices are the structural elements of this ensemble , while the @xmath17 s are just a set of random variables that change from realization to realization . pictorially speaking , the matrices @xmath20 form the scaffolding which supports the random variables @xmath17 .",
    "the properties of the egoe(2 ) ( averages , higher moments and correlation functions ) of both the hamiltonian and the green s functions are completely determined by the matrices @xmath20 .    the ensemble average of the hamiltonian is obviously zero .",
    "the second moment is [ hameg ] = _ ( d _ ( ) ) ^2  .",

    "is realized , we find ( a ) @xmath32 , ( b ) @xmath33 , ( c ) @xmath34 , and ( d ) @xmath2 .",
    "the number of zero matrix elements dominates ( it is close to @xmath35 ) .",
    "the number of unit values comes next and is approximately @xmath36 .",
    "the number of values @xmath37 is @xmath34 .",
    "the number of values @xmath38 is trivially equal to @xmath2 , the dimension of the matrix and the number of diagonal elements .",
    "the correlators @xmath39 can also be worked out easily but are not given here .",
    "they do not all vanish . therefore , the random variables @xmath40 are not independent .",
    "this reflects the fact that the same matrix element of the two  body interaction may couple different pairs of slater determinants .",
    "the individual matrices @xmath16 have a very simple structure and barely mix many - body states .",
    "let the tbme corresponding to index @xmath41 change the occupation of @xmath22 particles .",
    "for @xmath42 the matrix @xmath16 is diagonal .",
    "for @xmath43 the matrix @xmath16 can be ordered to have @xmath44 block matrices of dimension two and is zero otherwise .",
    "this shows that individual matrices @xmath16 can not generate mixing and chaos .",
    "we consider the limit of large matrix dimension @xmath2 , attained by taking the limit @xmath45 .",
    "this can be done in two ways : ( i ) by keeping the ratio @xmath46 fixed ; ( ii ) by keeping @xmath9 fixed . (",
    "i ) the ratio of the number of non  diagonal elements with variance unity to the total number of matrix elements is @xmath47 .",
    "this ratio tends to zero as @xmath45 .",
    "the same ratio calculated for the non  diagonal elements with variance @xmath37 vanishes even faster .",
    "the correlators of the diagonal elements are @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of single  particle states that are occupied in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the correlation is maximal for @xmath50 and vanishes for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for fixed @xmath18 and @xmath49 , the number of states @xmath19",
    "for which the occupation of @xmath49 single  particle states is the same as in @xmath18 is @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , this yields @xmath55 and for @xmath56 , we find @xmath57 .",
    "the ratio of both expressions to @xmath2 vanishes exponentially fast as @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the matrices approach diagonal form with uncorrelated diagonal elements that all have the same variance .",
    "this is suggestive of the poissonian distribution .",
    "( ii ) the ratio of the number of non  diagonal elements with variance unity to the total number of matrix elements is @xmath58 and vanishes exponentially fast .",
    "the same holds true _ a fortiori _ for the elements with variance @xmath59 .",
    "again , the correlators of the diagonal elements are given by @xmath60 , and the number of states which correlate to a given one with this correlator is @xmath61 .",
    "the ratio of this value to @xmath2 vanishes as a power of @xmath62 . again , this is suggestive of the poissonian distribution .",
    "we note , however , that sparseness of a random matrix is no guarantee for poissonian statistics .",
    "indeed , fyodorov and mirlin  @xcite have shown that sparse random matrices with @xmath63 non  vanishing matrix elements that have a frequency @xmath64 and no preference for large diagonal elements may have either poissonian or goe statistics , depending on the value of @xmath65 .",
    "while these results are quite suggestive , the question about spectral fluctuations of the egoe(2 ) in the limit of large matrix dimension remains open .",
    "we apply these considerations to the half ",
    "filled @xmath0-shell ( disregarding , of course , all conserved quantum numbers ) .",
    "the number of single  particle states is @xmath66 ; the number of nucleons is @xmath67 .",

    "the corresponding matrices of the embedded ensemble have dimension @xmath69 .",
    "the variance of the diagonal elements is @xmath70 .",
    "the fraction of non  diagonal elements with variance unity is approximately @xmath71 , that of those with variance @xmath72 is approximately @xmath73 .",
    "the hamiltonian matrices of the egoe(2 ) are thus characterized by their sparsity , strong diagonal structure , and a relatively large number of independent tbme .",
    "this structure is very different indeed from that of the goe . in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ hamegoe ] ) , the matrix elements of the goe hamiltonian can be written in the form h^goe _ = _ j < l = 1^n v_j l d^goe_(j , l )  . [ hamgoe ] the random variables @xmath74 are defined for @xmath75 where @xmath2 is the dimension of @xmath76 and are uncorrelated gaussian  distributed random variables with zero mean and a common second moment .",
    "the matrices @xmath77 again determine the structure of the ensemble and are given by d^goe_(j , l ) = _ j _",
    "[ dgoe ] each such matrix is symmetric and has only one non  vanishing matrix element above or in the main diagonal .",

    "usually does not write the goe in the form of eq .",
    "( [ hamgoe ] ) .",
    "this form is , however , useful for purposes of comparison .",
    "we observe that in the goe , the number of independent random variables and , thus , of matrices @xmath77 is as large as is consistent with the basic symmetry ( invariance under time reversal ) of the ensemble . in the egoe(2 ) and for matrices of the same dimension @xmath2 , the number of independent random variables and , thus , of matrices @xmath20 is strongly reduced .",
    "this strong reduction is accompanied by a strong increase in the number of non  vanishing matrix elements of each of the matrices @xmath20 .",
    "although sparse , the matrices @xmath20 are much less so than their goe counterparts .",
    "in this section we consider the tbre , both for a single @xmath5shell and for the @xmath0shell .",
    "we first investigate the tbre for the case of a single @xmath5shell .",
    "this is the simplest case and already exhibits the major difference to the egoe .",
    "then we consider the more realistic ( and more complex ) case of the @xmath0shell where we encounter several sub  shells and also have to include isospin in our analysis .",
    "we consider @xmath9 fermions in a single @xmath5shell .",
    "( later , we will consider the example @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",

    ", neccessary to understand the properties and structure of these matrices .",
    "in contrast to the egoe(2 ) , the matrices @xmath86 are determined by both , the spin symmetry and the fermionic nature of the @xmath9body system .",
    "each element is given in terms of sums over products of angular  momentum coupling coefficients and coefficients of fractional parentage and is , thus , a rather complex quantity .",
    "therefore , the properties of the matrices @xmath84 can not be inferred as easily as those of the matrices @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ hameg ] ) .",
    "some facts can be established analytically . for what remains ,",
    "we rely on numerical investigations .    for @xmath10 , the number @xmath87 of @xmath9body states of fixed total spin @xmath7 is approximately given by n(j ) ( _ j,0 + 2 j ) \\ { - }  . [ numb ]",
    "the right  hand side is the leading term in an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",

    "we note that the trend seen in the comparison between the goe and the egoe(2 ) continues unabatedly : in comparison with the matrix dimension , the number of independent random variables is reduced much below the egoe(2 ) value . to achieve complete mixing of the states ,",
    "this small number must be compensated by an increased density of the matrix elements of the matrices @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath91 matrices @xmath92 can be viewed as matrix representations of @xmath91 operators @xmath93 . as shown in the appendix ,",

    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the mixing between partitions is not as strong as that within each partition , @xmath120 will , for @xmath121si and @xmath122 @xmath123 , generically generate chaos . to show this , we have compared our figure  [ fig1 ] with the corresponding figure for the wildenthal two  body interaction ( which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown there to produce chaos ; see , e.g. , figs .",
    "23(a ) and 23(c ) of that reference ) .",
    "the two figures are indistinguishable .",
    "the aims and results of our paper can be summarized from two points of view , from that of random ",
    "matrix theory and from that of nuclear structure theory .    from the viewpoint of random  matrix theory ,",
    "we have compared three random  matrix ensembles that have been used in the past to deal with interacting many ",
    "body systems and , in particular , with nuclei : the goe , the egoe(2 ) , and the tbre , the latter applied to a single @xmath5shell and to the @xmath0shell . in our comparison , we have emphasized the central role of the structure matrices denoted by @xmath77 , @xmath20 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "these matrices provide the scaffolding of the underlying random  matrix ensemble .",
    "averages , higher moments and correlation functions of all observables can be expressed in terms of and are completely determined by these matrices .",
    "these matrices then must form the central object of study of the said random  matrix ensembles .    in the framework of a many  body problem , use of the goe",
    "is tantamount to assuming many  body forces the rank of which equals the number of valence particles .",
    "this unrealistic aspect of the goe has to be weighed against the great advantage of its structural simplicity .",
    "this simplicity is due to the orthogonal invariance of the goe .",
    "it allows for a complete analytical calculation of all moments and correlation functions .",
    "hence the predictive power of the goe .",
    "the orthogonal invariance manifests itself in the large number ( @xmath126 with @xmath2 the matrix dimension ) of independent random variables and in the extreme simplicity of the structural matrices @xmath77 . in the goe",
    ", no reference is made to the possible existence of quantum numbers like spin or isospin .",
    "the egoe(2 ) is designed to deal with many ",
    "body systems which are governed by two  body forces . in this respect the egoe(2 ) is a much more realistic model than the goe .",
    "the model does not possess the orthogonal invariance of the goe .",
    "this is why all attempts at calculating spectral fluctuations analytically for this ensemble have failed so far .",
    "for the same matrix dimension , the number of uncorrelated random variables is much smaller than in the goe . to achieve complete mixing of the basis states ,",
    "this reduction must be made up for by a greater complexity of the matrices @xmath20 .",
    "we have displayed the structure of these matrices which individually are quite sparse but jointly provide for strong mixing of the basis states . like the goe , the egoe(2 ) does not allow for the possible existence of quantum numbers like spin or isospin .",
    "the tbre is more realistic yet than the egoe(2 ) in that it does take account of the two essential properties of the residual interaction of the nuclear shell model : the interaction is a two  body interaction , and it preserves spin , parity , and isospin .",
    "the existence of symmetries associated with these quantum numbers has an essential influence on the structure of the ensemble and of the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125 which embody this structure : compared to the egoe(2 ) with the same matrix dimension , the number of independent random variables is much reduced once again , but the complexity of the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125 is much increased .",
    "it appears that the tbre is even harder to deal with than the egoe(2 ) . in any case , we are not aware of any previous attempts to study this ensemble analytically . in the tbre for a single @xmath5shell ,",
    "the non  commuting matrices @xmath124 have strong diagonal elements ( a feature already encountered for the egoe(2 ) and related to sum rules ) .",
    "the non  diagonal elements are not sparse but , on the contrary , dense .",
    "this is how a complete mixing of the basis states is achieved in the @xmath5shell tbre . in the @xmath0shell tbre , the existence of sub  shells and the associated block structure of the matrices @xmath125 lends greater complexity yet to the ensemble .",
    "mixing is very strong within the diagonal blocks and weaker for the off  diagonal ones . in both these ensembles",
    ", symmetries play an important role and , together with the exclusion principle , define the structure of the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "it goes without saying that the relevant symmetry operators must not from a complete set of commuting operators as otherwise there would be no room left for a random  matrix ensemble .    from the point of view of nuclear structure theory",
    ", we have uncovered generic features of shell  model calculations .",
    "these are embodied in the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "every shell  model calculation for a single @xmath5shell or for the @xmath0shell amounts to choosing a specific linear combination of these matrices ( the same for every value of spin @xmath7 ) , and diagonalizing the resulting hamiltonian matrix .",
    "corresponding statements apply for other shells . inasmuch as there is evicence for chaos in one such calculation using a specific set of two  body matrix elements , the properties of the matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125 displayed above guarantee that spectra and eigenfunctions calculated for most other choices of the two ",
    "body interaction will likewise be chaotic .",
    "the two  body interactions for which this statement does not apply form a set of measure zero .",
    "it is in this sense that we have demonstrated that chaos is a generic property of the nuclear shell",
    "we have also shown that symmetries ( which are due to the existence of an incomplete set of commuting operators ) determine the structure of the tbre in an essential way .",
    "thus , such symmetries are vital for the occurrence of chaos in the tbre .",
    "another aspect of our work ( not emphasized in the present paper but a natural spin  off ) is the existence of correlations between many ",
    "body spectra having different quantum numbers like total spin @xmath7 .",
    "it is immediately obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ mom2 ] ) and ( [ hamsm ] ) that hamiltonian matrices pertaining to different spin values in the same nucleus are correlated since they depend on the same set of random variables .",
    "this fact has been used to explain the observed preponderance of spin  zero ground states in calculations using the tbre  @xcite .",
    "our considerations are restricted to spherical nuclei and totally degenerate major shells .",
    "we have remarked in the introduction that lifting this degeneracy by taking into account the differences of the single  particle energies in individual sub  shells , will drive the system toward regularity .",
    "our considerstions do not apply to deformed nuclei . here",
    "the nilsson model provides a single  particle basis in which it is meaningless to assume degenerate single  particle energies .",
    "such nuclei possess well  developed collective motion .",
    "however , collective motion exists also beyond the regime of well  deformed nuclei .",
    "it has been notoriously difficult in the past to understand this fact in the framework of the spherical shell model , with the exception of certain types of collectivity like that of the giant dipole resonance .",
    "understanding both , collectivity and chaos , within a common framework is , thus , a goal of future work .",
    "we observe , however , that collectivity typically involves levels with different quantum numbers ( like those forming a rotational band ) while chaos is a property displayed by levels with identical quantum numbers .",
    "thus , in nuclei chaos and collectivity need not be antagonistic .",

    "this is justified because upon using a taylor expansion and performing the gaussian integration , such terms will produce inverse powers of @xmath9 and are , therefore , negligible .",

    "( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "their sum is denoted by @xmath152 and can be calculated along quite similar lines . in the same asymptotic limit",
    "we find n_1(m ) -  .",

    "that same statement holds _ a fortiori _ for the contributions which are of higher order in the kronecker delta s .",
    "thus , @xmath153 , and @xmath129 then gives the result  ( [ numb ] ) .",
    "we come to the definition of the operators @xmath95 .",
