    "in this paper we investigate the potential for the use of incoherent scattered data for 2d reconstruction in x - ray scanning applications .",
    "the use of scattered data for image reconstruction is considered in the literature , typically for applications in gamma ray imaging , where the photon source is monochromatic @xcite . however , in many applications ( e.g security screening of baggage ) a type of x - ray tube is often used that generates a polychromatic spectrum of initial photon energies ( see section [ phys ] for an example spectrum ) .",
    "there has been recent interest in the use of energy sensitive detectors in tomography @xcite , and in the present paper their application is key to the ideas presented .",
    "our main goal is to show that the electron density may be reconstructed analytically using the incoherent scattered data and to lay the foundations for a practical reconstruction method based on our theory .",
    "we apply our method to a machine configuration commonly used in x - ray ct . in addition , by use of the reconstructed density values in conjunction with an attenuation coefficient reconstruction , we show under the right assumptions that the atomic number of the target is uniquely determined .    for a photon incident upon an electron compton ( incoherently ) scattering at an angle @xmath0 with initial energy @xmath1 , the scattered energy @xmath2",
    "is given by the equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4kev is the electron rest energy .",
    "equation ( [ equ1 ] ) implies that @xmath0 remains fixed for any given @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "so in the case of a monochromatic source , assuming only single scatter events , for every fixed measured energy @xmath2 ( possible to measure if the detectors are energy - resolved ) the locus of scattering points is a circular arc intersecting the source and detector in question .",
    "for example , refer to @xcite .    in an x - ray tube a cathode is negatively charged and electrons are accelerated by a large voltage ( @xmath5 kv ) towards a positively charged target material ( e.g tungsten ) . a small proportion of the initial electron energy ( @xmath6 ) is converted to produce photons . due to energy conservation ,",
    "the resulting photon energies are no more than @xmath5 kev .",
    "so in the polychromatic source case , again assuming only single scatter events , for each given data set ( photon intensity recorded with energy @xmath2 ) , the set of scatterers lie on a collection of circular arcs intersecting the source and detector points . together",
    "these form a toric section in which the photons scatter , with a maximum scattering angle @xmath7 given by : @xmath8 see figure [ fig1 ] below :    ( -cos(30),0.5 ) coordinate ( s ) ; ( cos(30 ) , 0.5 ) coordinate ( d ) ; ( -0.5,0.86 ) coordinate ( w ) ; ( -0.13,1.22 ) coordinate ( a ) ; plot ( cos ( ) , sin ( ) ) ; ( s )  ( d ) ; ( s )  ( w ) ; ( w )  ( d ) ; ( w)(a ) ; at ( -0.95,0.48 ) @xmath9 ; at ( 0.95,0.5 ) @xmath10 ; at ( -0.25,0.88 ) @xmath7 ; at ( -0.3,0.4 ) t ; plot ( , -sqrt(1-pow(,2))+1 ) ;     + in the present paper we consider a setup consisting of a ring of fixed energy sensitive detectors and a single rotating fan beam polychromatic source",

    "<S> we lay the foundations for a new fast method to reconstruct the electron density in x - ray scanning applications using measurements in the dark field . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applied to a type of machine configuration with fixed energy sensitive ( or resolving ) detectors , and where the x - ray source is polychromatic . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case where the measurements in the dark field are dominated by the compton scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to a 2d inverse problem where we aim to reconstruct an electron density slice from its integrals over discs whose boundaries intersect the given source point . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a unique solution exists for smooth densities compactly supported on an annulus centred at the source point .    using sobolev space estimates </S>",
    "<S> we determine a measure for the ill posedness of our problem based on the criterion given by natterer in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with a combination of our method and the more common attenuation coefficient reconstruction , we show under certain assumptions that the atomic number of the target is uniquely determined .    </S>",
    "<S> we test our method on simulated data sets with varying levels of added pseudo random noise . </S>"
