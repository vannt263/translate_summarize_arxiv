    "gravitational lenses have long held the promise of being natural telescopes , probing structural scales smaller than the resolution of current technologies while simultaneously revealing the distribution of matter within the lensing galaxy ( for reviews of gravitational lensing , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    ", this promise can only be truly realised in systems in which the lensed images are extended , as these can offer substantially more constraints than multiply imaged point - like quasars .",
    "for this reason , significant attention has been paid to extended sources lensed by intervening galaxies to produce roughly circular images known as einstein rings @xcite .",
    "a long - standing issue has focused upon the question of what is the _",
    "best _ approach to invert such extended gravitationally lensed images , providing the unlensed source brightness distribution and mass in the lensing galaxy . addressing this question",
    "has spawned a number of seemingly distinct methods , such as the ring cycle @xcite , semi - linear inversion @xcite and genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "given the extended nature of the source , reconstructions have been based upon a pixellated source plane , so as to make minimal assumptions about the source brightness distributions .",
    "however , due to the ill - posed nature of such an inversion , authors have tended to use low numbers of pixels , and/or regularization . in a previous contribution , we demonstrated that other approaches can be unified in terms of a bayesian interpretation , with each corresponding to the use of particular , often unjustified , assumptions about the nature of the source ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bl06 ) . furthermore , bl06presented a general bayesian approach to the question of gravitational lens inversion , using realistic prior distributions and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods to recover the properties of the lensing system .    in this present contribution , the approach detailed in bl06  is applied to the well - studied optical einstein ring 0047 - 2808 . in section",
    "[ image ] , the details of this system , and the data employed , are presented , while section  [ approach ] details the approach to the problem .",
    "section  [ results ] outlines the results of this study , with a comparison to other techniques , while the conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the optical einstein ring 0047 - 2808 was identified serendipitously in a survey of massive elliptical galaxies at @xmath4 via the identification of an anomalous emission line , with subsequent imaging revealing a ring of high redshift ( @xmath5 ) emission superimposed upon a @xmath6 galaxy .",
    "initial estimates suggested that the source was magnified by a factor of @xmath7 and hence detailed spectroscopy is able to probe this high redshift , kiloparsec scale star - forming galaxy @xcite .      since its discovery @xcite",
    ", the optical einstein ring 0047 - 2808 has been the subject of several different studies whose goal was a full lensing inversion and reconstruction of the source brightness distribution .",
    "the more recent of these have focused upon observations obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard the hubble space telescope and given its superior resolution over previous ground - based observations , this data is the subject of this current contribution .    the raw pixel scale of the wfpc2 ccd used in imaging 0047 - 2808 is 0.1 arcseconds , but the image used in this study is comprised of four interlaced dithered images , giving a pixel resolution of 0.05 arcseconds ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the foreground lensing galaxy has been subtracted , after fitting its brightness distribution with a sersic profile .",
    "a region of 61@xmath161 pixels , centred on the resulting lensed image and encompassing a region of 3.05@xmath13.05 arcseconds , was extracted and employed in this study ; this image is presented in figure  [ data ] .    as with @xcite , a noise frame covering the same region and including the various noise components ( such as that from the light distribution of the lensing galaxy ) was also employed .",
    "it should be noted that this study did not recreate the image dithering procedure that was undertaken with the observed system , rather it is assumed that the image presented in figure  [ data ] is a true representation of this lensing system at a resolution of 0.05 arcseconds . to this end",
    ", the point spread function was generated with the tinytim algorithm to match this resolution scale @xcite .",
    "although in reality the noise values between neighbouring pixels are correlated , we will use an uncorrelated likelihood function , which is computationally much more managable and will lead to slightly more conservative results .",
    "the basis of our method was presented in bl06 . for a more general introduction to bayesian methods , including markov chain monte carlo techniques ,",
    "see the textbook by @xcite . assuming a particular form for the lens model , and background information or assumptions @xmath8 , we write down the joint probability distribution for the lens and source parameters ( denoted collectively by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ) given the data @xmath11 and the prior information and assumptions @xmath8",
    ":    @xmath12    the denominator does not depend on the source and lens parameters , so is part of the normalisation constant for the joint probability distribution .",
    "the first factor in the numerator is the joint prior probability density of the lens and source parameters , and the second factor is the likelihood function ( probability density of the data that was actually observed , given the parameters ) .",
    "commonly , the source is pixellated into @xmath13 pixels and is described by a vector @xmath14 of pixel intensities , and the observed image is also pixellated ( with @xmath15 pixels ) , and is represented by a vector @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the image predicted by a source is calculated by a matrix multiplication : @xmath17 .",
    "the matrix @xmath18 depends on the lens parameters @xmath9 and the point spread function .",
    "since it is always possible that the noise level values \\{@xmath19 } are not completely reliable , we also introduced an extra noise parameter @xmath20 , to be estimated from the data @xcite .",
    "if a good fit is possible with our model , @xmath20 will be estimated to be small .",
    "if a good fit is not possible , @xmath20 will be estimated to be large , and the uncertainties in all other inferred parameters will also be increased .",
    "thus , we can use the inferred value of @xmath20 as a kind of alternative - free test of whether our lens model is adequate . under the usual assumptions ( a gaussian probability distribution for the error in each pixel of the image , and logical independence of the prior information about the lens and the source )",
    ", we have the pdf    @xmath21    @xmath22 e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{(o_i - \\sum_{j=1}^ml_{ij}s_j)^2}{\\sigma^2 + \\sigma_i^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the right hand side depends on the lens parameters through the matrix @xmath18 in some complicated nonlinear fashion .",
    "therefore , there is no hope of finding marginal distributions analytically , so we will use a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to generate random samples from this posterior distribution .      for its convenient properties , we chose an softened power - law elliptical potential ( spep ) for the lens model @xcite .",
    "elliptical potentials have the advantage of faster computation of the deflection angles than for elliptical projected mass distributions , and great flexibility in the range of possible lenses is achievable with a handful of parameters .",
    "hopefully , this flexibility is sufficient to ensure that we wo nt make any overconfident conclusions caused by the fact that real lenses are not exactly described by some parametric model .",
    "the primary reason for choosing this model was computational speed , which is an important consideration because our mcmc algorithm requires a lot of likelihood evaluations .",
    "the 2-d lensing potential we used was    @xmath23    where @xmath24    the gradient of @xmath25 gives the deflection angles as @xmath26 @xmath27    the parameter @xmath28 is the overall strength of the lens , and @xmath29 is the ratio of the ellipse s major and minor axes .",
    "@xmath30 indicates an approximately circularly symmetric lens .",
    "furthermore , @xmath31 is position in the lens plane , in a coordinate system aligned with the lens and centred at the centre of the lens .",
    "thus , in fitting the lens to an observed image , we have 7 free parameters : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath32 ( the position of the centre of the lens ) , @xmath33 , a slope parameter , the core radius @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the angle of orientation of the lens mass distribution with respect to the axes defined by the image .",
    "if @xmath36,@xmath37 and @xmath38 , this model reduces to the common isothermal sphere model , for which @xmath28 is the einstein radius .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath39 were considered known a priori in previous investigations ; here we will consider them partially known by assigning a weakly informative prior probability density .",
    "using the scaled lens equation with source and image plane positions measured in arc seconds corresponds to a choice of the units of mass , as being that which would make the einstein radius equal to 1 arc second .",
    "it is usually the case that an image can be fitted with a variety of differently parametrized lens models .",
    "however , for most purposes we are more interested in the values of the parameters themselves ( e.g. how much mass is there , how elliptical is the density profile , is it aligned with the light profile of the lensing galaxy , etc ) and little would be gained by comparing different choices for the parameterisation of the mass model .",
    "however , we suspect that , if very high resolution images were available , simple lens models would be inadequate and we would need to use a nonparametric mass model , similar to that used by @xcite for weak lensing .",
    "it is difficult to determine at what point this would be neceessary , however , if our `` extra noise '' parameter @xmath20 was inferred to be large then this would be a definite indication that a different mass model is required .      in order for the problem to have a definite solution , we need to introduce prior probability distributions for the parameters of the lens model , to describe our prior knowledge or ignorance about their values . in principle",
    ", we could consider the image of the foreground galaxy as providing prior information , however we did not carry out any sophisticated analysis along these lines , because the final results depend only very weakly on the specific choice of functions .",
    "the prior probability densities we used for each parameter are shown in table  [ lenspriors ] .",
    "these are only intended to capture vague prior information about the range of values that the parameter could plausibly take .",
    "for the position of the centre of the lens model , we assumed this was near the centre of the light profile of the foreground galaxy , but the large prior standard deviation of 0.2 means that this is a weak assumption .",
    ".prior probability densities for the lens model parameters , and also the extra noise parameter @xmath20 .",

    "in this paper , we have presented an analysis of the hst image of the einstein ring 0047 - 2808 using a bayesian procedure .",
    "most of the results are qualitatively consistent with previous work , leading us to conclude that the various different methods available for reconstructing gravitational lens systems all give satisfactory results for this system , despite the disagreement about the uncertainties in the parameter estimates",
    ". however , this may not always be the case with other data sets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example ) .",
    "however , our use of smaller pixels and a more reasonable prior for the source has allowed us to reconstruct the source with a greater resolution than has been possible with other methods . as a result",
    ", we have found that the second component of the source is not just a single patch of light , but has a narrow structure protruding from it ; given structure formation in @xmath40cdm cosmologies , we should expect such objects in the early universe to show significant substructures indicative of major mergers and accretion .",
    "discovered in continuum radio sources @xcite , the number , diversity and observational detail of einstein rings has continued to grow  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , optical einstein rings should be uncovered in a upcoming surveys @xcite , particularly the slacs survey @xcite , and the number of cases is steadily increasing .",
    "hence it is vital that progress is made in developing and understanding optimal and reliable methods for analyzing them .",
    "model selection will probably play an important role in this area in the future @xcite , however we doubt that it will be useful to compare the evidence for one ad - hoc regularization formula against another , when it is known in advance that neither of them accurately describe the prior information that is available . despite these concerns , the level of qualitative agreement between the results presented in this paper and in others show that these debates may only be of minor importance in practice .",
