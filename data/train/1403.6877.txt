    "a primary aim of statistical mechanics and probability theory is to describe aggregate behavior of disordered microscopic systems driven by noise .",
    "many systems include self - averaging mechanisms which result in the appearance of deterministic ( law of large number ) behavior on macroscopic scales .",
    "a central problem is to characterize the behavior of such systems between microscopic disorder and macroscopic order . on critical mesoscopic scales ,",
    "large classes of systems seem to share universal fluctuation behaviors . this belief in `` universality classes '' is bolstered by ( non - rigorous ) physical arguments , extensive numerics , some experimental results and , recently , a growing body of mathematical proof coming from the field of integrable probability .",
    "`` integrable '' or `` exactly solvable '' models play a key role in probing the nature and extent of universality classes . due to enhanced algebraic structure",
    "they are often amenable to detailed analysis , thus providing the most complete access to various phenomena such as phase transition , scaling exponents , and fluctuation statistics .",
    "the success of integrable probability in describing universal behaviors is quite strking for the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics problem of describing random interface growth . in this section",
    "we provide examples of integrable probabilistic systems whose analysis deepens our understanding of random @xmath0-dimensional random interface growth and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class . through these examples",
    "we also demonstrate connections to interacting particle systems ( models for traffic flow , queuing , mass transport , driven gases , and shock - fronts ) , directed polymers in random media ( models for competition interfaces , domain walls , and cracking interfaces ) , and parabolic anderson models ( models for population growth with migration ) .",
    "see the review @xcite for further background and references .",
    "the study of kpz universality was initiated by kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite in 1986 and drew heavily on earlier work of forster - nelson - stephens @xcite in 1977 .",
    "the ensuing decade of physical theories , numerics , and experiments produced strong physical evidence for universality of random interface fluctuations in their long - time and large - scale limits .",
    "the fluctuation scaling exponent and transversal correlation length was predicted to be @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( meaning fluctuations of order @xmath3 correlated over distances @xmath4 , with @xmath5 measuring time ) .",
    "certain statistics ( e.g. skewness , kurtosis , tail decay ) were also computed numerically during this period .",
    "the involvement of mathematicians and the first ( mathematically ) rigorous results and exact formulas for fluctuation statistics came in 1999 with the work of baik - deift - johansson @xcite and johansson @xcite .",
    "our first example below details some of johansson s @xcite asymptotic analysis results on tasep .",
    "the methods of determinant point process or schur measure / process ( of which tasep is a special limiting case ) have driven many further advances in understanding kpz class statistics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all those models analyzed by these determinantal methods are `` totally asymmetric '' or `` zero temperature '' .    the first analysis ( to the point of asymptotic statistics ) of a non - determinantal kpz class model",
    "was performed by tracy and widom @xcite in 2009 . since then",
    ", a variety of methods have been developed to discover and analyze non - determinantal `` partially asymmetric '' or `` positive temperature '' models .    in this paper",
    "we describe some facets of the exact solvability of @xmath6-tasep , the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer , asep , and the kpz equation .",
    "we then develop two methods used in studying these examples : ( 1 ) the theory macdonald processes , which is an algebraic framework for discovering and analyzing a variety of probabilistic system by leveraging the remarkable properties of macdonald symmetric polynomials ; ( 2 ) the theory of quantum integrable systems , which is based on the ( coordinate / algebraic ) bethe ansatz and provides a means to diagonalize certain hamiltonians , including some stochastic generators related to the processes with which we are concern .",
    "we develop both of these methods at a high combinatorial ( or algebraic ) level and thus avoid many of the analytic issues and demystify the apparent algebraic miracles which arise in various degenerations .",
    "for instance , our treatment of @xmath6-tasep in section [ secqis ] can be considered a mathematically rigorous version of the replica method for directed polymers @xcite .",
    "there are many other exciting recent developments related to the kpz which we will not discuss at any length . to name a few ,",
    "these include : tropical combinatorics and directed polymers @xcite , line ensembles @xcite , coupling methods and second class particles @xcite , spectral methods @xcite , experiments confirming kpz statistics @xcite , kpz equation well - posedness @xcite .",
    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is an interacting particle system on @xmath7 .",
    "particles inhabit sites of @xmath7 with only one particle per site at any given time . in continuous time , particles attempt to orchestrate independent random jumps according to rate one exponential clocks ( in other words , according to exponential distributed waiting times of rate one ) by one site to the right . if the destination site is occupied , the jump is suppressed .",
    "this process may be described in terms of occupation variables which track of whether sites of @xmath7 are occupied , or particle location variables which tracks the location of indexed particles .",
    "we will , instead , appeal to a `` height function '' to describe this process .",
    "the tasep height function is a piece - wise linear function made up of unit @xmath8 or @xmath9 slope line increments . above every site of @xmath7 with a particle",
    ", there is a @xmath9 slope and above every site without a particle there is a @xmath8 sloped .",
    "the height function @xmath10 pastes these increments together into a continuous function ( uniquely defined up to an overall height shift ) .",
    "tasep dynamics corresponds to replacing local minima @xmath11 by maxima @xmath12 according to rate one exponential clocks . in this language of height functions , tasep is equivalent to the _ corner growth model_. this is illustrated in figure [ tasep ] .",
    "johansson @xcite computed an exact formula for the one - point distribution of the tasep height function , when initialized from `` step '' or `` wedge '' initial data .",
    "this initial data corresponds to starting with every site to the left of the origin occupied , and all other sites empty . in terms of the height function",
    "this corresponds to starting with @xmath13 .      studying the long - time , large - scale fluctuation behavior of this height function revealed the first exact formulas for statistics of the kpz universality class .",
    "the prediction coming from @xcite was that in large time @xmath14 , the height function should be non - trivially correlated on a scale of order @xmath15 with fluctuations of order @xmath16 . define the scaled height function @xmath17 where @xmath14 is a large scaling parameter and the centering by @xmath18 follows from the hydrodynamic theory for tasep .",
    "johansson @xcite showed the following :    [ thmtasepgue ] for tasep with step initial data @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the tracy - widom limit distribution @xcite for the largest eigenvalue of a large hermitian random matrix .",
    "this result provides an exact prediction for the limiting one - point behavior of a wide class of models which share general characteristics with tasep ( and which are started from step type initial data ) . in many ways ,",
    "this @xmath21 distribution is to @xmath22)-dimensional random growth as the gaussian distribution is to random walks .",
    "asymptotic analysis of the remaining examples we discuss yield the same scaling and distributional limit , thus providing further evidence for kpz universality .    using methods of determinantal point processes , further exact statistics describing the kpz class",
    "has been extracted through studying the large @xmath14 limit of @xmath23 ( e.g. the airy processes describing the fixed @xmath5 and varying @xmath24 limit for step and a few other types of initial data , see @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between random matrix theory and growth processes will be alluded to further in our discussion of macdonald processes in section [ secmac ] .",
    "tasep is one of a handful of examples of particle systems and growth models which are analyzable via determinantal point processes ( or equivalently schur processes , free fermions , non - intersecting paths ) .",
    "these other examples are discrete time taseps with sequential or parallel update rules , pushasep or long range tasep , directed last passage percolation in two dimension with geometric , exponential or bernoulli weights , and the polynuclear growth process ",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the examples which we address here are deformations ( and limits of deformations ) of tasep .",
    "these examples are no longer determinantal , though there still turn out to be large families of observables whose averages are explicit ( for determinantal systems correlation functions are written explicitly as determinants ) .",
    "integrability is quite sensitive to perturbations and while these deformations are integrable , there are many simple models , closely related to tasep , which are not .      the @xmath6-deformed totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( @xmath6-tasep ) is a one parameter deformation of tasep which was discovered and first studied in the context of macdonald processes @xcite ( see also subsequent work @xcite ) . fix @xmath25 and let @xmath26 be the location of particle @xmath27 at time @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 for @xmath29 and that there is a right - most particle which we label @xmath30 ( for notational convenience fix @xmath31 ) . in continuous time , each particle @xmath32 attempts to jump one site to the right according to an exponential clock of rate @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the number of empty sites between particle @xmath27 and the next - right particle @xmath35 .",
