    "<S>  spin noise spectroscopy \" ( sns ) is a powerful optical technique for probing electron and hole spin dynamics that is based on detecting their intrinsic and random fluctuations while in thermal equilibrium , an approach guaranteed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . because sns measures fluctuation properties rather than conventional response functions , we show that fluctuation </S>",
    "<S> _ correlations _ can be exploited in multi - probe noise studies to reveal information that in general can not be accessed by conventional linear optical spectroscopy , such as the underlying homogeneous linewidths of individual constituents within inhomogeneously - broadened systems . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in an ensemble of singly - charged ( in , ga)as quantum dots using two weak probe lasers : when the two lasers have the same wavelength , they are sensitive to the same qds in the ensemble and their spin fluctuation signals are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , two probe lasers that are widely detuned from each other measure different subsets of qds , leading to uncorrelated fluctuations . measuring the noise correlation versus laser detuning directly reveals the qd homogeneous linewidth even in the presence of a strong inhomogeneous broadening . such noise - based correlation techniques are not limited to semiconductor spin systems , but can be widely applied to any system in which intrinsic fluctuations are measurable .    </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneous broadening is ubiquitous in the physical , chemical and materials sciences , occurring whenever a collection of nominally - equivalent constituents differ in , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , size , shape , composition , conformation and/or local environment . </S>",
    "<S> notable examples in nanoscale materials include ensembles of nanocrystals , quantum dots , nanotubes , or molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in optically active systems , such broadening typically leads to a spread of the constituents fundamental absorption or emission energies over an inhomogeneously broadened band of spectral width @xmath0 , which can be orders of magnitude larger than the underlying _ homogeneous _ </S>",
    "<S> linewidth @xmath1 of the individual constituents themselves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually , however , @xmath1 is the essential quantity of interest , since @xmath1 directly reveals ( or at least constrains ) the fundamental relaxation rates and coherence times of the system , which are the crucial parameters for many applications .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , @xmath1 is generally inaccessible in inhomogenously - broadened ensembles using conventional low - power / linear optical spectroscopic techniques , which typically measure time- and ensemble - averaged response functions ( such as absorption , photoluminescence , polarization , _ etc _ ) . to circumvent this limitation , various _ non - linear _ </S>",
    "<S> optical methods have been very successfully developed over the years to extract @xmath1 from inhomogeneously broadened ensembles ; examples include spectral - hole burning @xcite and four - wave mixing methods @xcite , which necessarily rely on the excitation and nonlinear optical response of the material . in parallel , a multitude of optical techniques for isolating and measuring _ single _ particles @xcite have also been developed to get around the problem of inhomogeneous broadening in ensemble studies .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we develop a novel low - power optical technique  two - color spin noise spectroscopy  and demonstrate that it can be used to reveal the underlying homogeneous linewidth @xmath1 of the individual constituents that make up an otherwise inhomogeneously - broadened ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we apply these methods to reveal @xmath1 of singly - charged ( in , ga)as quantum dots ( qds ) within an inhomogeously - broadened qd ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this optical technique operates in the linear / low - power regime and does not rely on any excitation or nonlinear response of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that this technique is _ not _ based on conventional time - averaged response functions , but rather is based on the _ intrinsic and random fluctuation properties _ of the system  in this case , spin fluctuations . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it exploits the fact that spin fluctuations from different qds in the ensemble are uncorrelated in time . by measuring the degree of correlation between two independent noise probes ( two probe lasers detuned from each other ) </S>",
    "<S> , we reveal the underlying homogeneous absorption linewidth , @xmath1 , of positively - charged qds in an ensemble measurement  information that is generally inaccessible to conventional linear spectroscopy .        </S>",
    "<S> optical spin noise spectroscopy ( sns ) is a powerful and relatively new technique for probing the dynamics of electron and/or hole spins , that is based on measuring their intrinsic fluctuations while they remain unperturbed and in thermal equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , though non - standard , is nonetheless assured by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which relates linear response functions to the frequency spectrum of intrinsic fluctuations @xcite . in a typical sns experiment , random spin fluctuations @xmath2 in an equilibrium sample </S>",
    "<S> impart faraday rotation ( optical polarization rotation ) fluctuations @xmath3 on a probe laser , which can be measured with high sensitivity . in the frequency domain , </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions , widths , and amplitudes of this faraday rotation ( fr ) noise reveal the detailed dynamical properties of the spins such as @xmath4-factors , coherence times , and relaxation rates  without ( in principle ) ever exciting or pumping the spin system itself . </S>",
    "<S> this latter appealing aspect arises because spin detection via fr depends on the system s dispersive indices of refraction ( rather than absorption ) , and in many systems it can form the basis for continuous quantum nondemolition measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical sns has been applied to alkali vapors @xcite , electrons in bulk _ </S>",
    "<S> n_-type gaas @xcite , quantum well microcavities @xcite , and recently to electron and hole spins in ( in , ga)as qd ensembles @xcite .    in all sns studies reported to date , </S>",
    "<S> a single probe laser was used to detect the intrinsic spin fluctuations of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for the studies of qd ensembles @xcite , this probe laser was tuned in wavelength to lie directly within the inhomogeneously - broadened absorption / photoluminescence band of the ensemble . because individual qds within the ensemble have very narrow homogeneous linewidths @xmath1 at low temperature @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the probe laser is particularly sensitive to spin fluctuations from those singly - charged qds having charged exciton ( trion ) optical transition energies close to the laser energy .    </S>",
    "<S> consider , as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , an inhomogeneously - broadened qd ensemble and two singly - charged dots ( qda and qdb ) with different trion transition energies within this ensemble . per the usual optical selection rules for spins in iii - v or ii - vi semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , individual qds within this ensemble exhibit spin - dependent absorption spectra for right- and left - circularly polarized light ( @xmath5 , assumed to be lorentzian ) that depend on the orientation of the resident spin . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath6 if the resident spin has projection  spin - up \" along the probe laser ( @xmath7 ) , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are swapped for opposite spin projection . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath10 is the photon energy , @xmath11 is the energy of the charged exciton transition of the qd in question , and @xmath1 is its homogeneous absorption linewidth . the faraday rotation , @xmath12 , that is imparted to a probe laser by this spin - dependent optical transition scales as the difference between the associated indices of refraction , @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 therefore when the resident spin in a qd fluctuates randomly in time , @xmath16 also fluctuates . in thermal equilibrium and in zero magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> its time average is of course zero ( @xmath17 ) , but its _ variance _ @xmath18  the fr noise power  is nonzero and is peaked at photon energies @xmath19 away from the qd resonance , and decays as @xmath20 for large detuning . </S>",
    "<S> ( note also that spin fluctuations induce no fr noise exactly on resonance when @xmath21 , because @xmath12 is an odd function ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the probe laser depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , which has photon energy close to the qda trion resonance , is much more sensitive to spin ( fr ) fluctuations from qda than from qdb .    we exploit this spectral selectivity , and also the fact that fluctuations of spins in different dots are nominally _ uncorrelated _ in time , to directly obtain @xmath1 in an ensemble measurement , using a low - intensity ( linear ) optical experiment based on spin noise . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we use _ two _ different probe lasers (  1 \" and  2 \" ) that are tuned within the broad absorption band of the qd ensemble , and measure the degree of correlation between the fr fluctuations that are imparted on the two lasers [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the two co - propagating probe lasers are incident on the same photodetectors , and </S>",
    "<S> the total measured fr is just the sum @xmath24 . </S>",

    "<S> it is straightforward to show that @xmath56 is expected to exhibit a lorentzian shape with hwhm equal to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> first , note that the total fr noise power detected by a single probe laser at energy @xmath57 is given by integrating up the fr noise power @xmath58 generated by all the qds ( at energies @xmath11 ) in the ensemble :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 has the same form as in eq . 2 , and @xmath61 is the inhomogeneously - broadened distribution of qd energies characterized by @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> since @xmath0 greatly exceeds both @xmath64 and typical detunings @xmath26 , @xmath61 can be approximated by a uniform distribution [ @xmath65 and @xmath34 can be calculated analytically : @xmath66 which is a lorentzian with hwhm=@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we note that if the lasers are tuned far _ outside _ of the inhomogeneous absorption band then @xmath56 is expected to be constant , a scenario that will be discussed and modeled later ) .    thus , using only low - power continuous - wave probe lasers and performing passive measurements , </S>",

    "<S> we consider an idealized inhomogeneously - broadened gaussian absorption band with @xmath92 . in the usual case where the probe lasers detect spin fluctuations via faraday rotation , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6a shows that when @xmath48 and/or @xmath89 is tuned within this broad inhomogeneous band , the spin noise is everywhere uncorrelated ( @xmath34=1 ) except along the thin diagonal line corresponding to @xmath91 ( more specifically , when @xmath93 ) . expanding this region ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , however , when both @xmath48 and @xmath89 lie well _ outside _ this broad absorption band , then neither probe laser is preferentially sensitive to nearly - resonant qds ( because there are no qds at the probe energies ) . in this case , both lasers are sensitive to the total fr fluctuations from the entire ensemble , and their fluctuations will be correlated ( @xmath94 ) _ independent of _ </S>",

    "<S> this was the precisely the case for the two - color spin noise measurement on the @xmath78-type gaas control sample shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar modeling can be performed for the case when spin fluctuations are measured via ellipticity noise , as shown in figures 6c , d and as experimentally observed in figure 5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note , however , that although @xmath34 can be calculated for all @xmath97 , ellipticity noise must generally be measured within the absorption band because otherwise the noise signals themselves become extremely small . )    in summary , we have introduced and demonstrated the new optical technique of two - color spin noise spectroscopy . despite being a low - power optical method that does not rely on excitation , pumping , or perturbation of the ensemble , it can directly reveal , _ e.g. _ , the underlying homogeneous linewidths of qds that are otherwise obscured in strongly inhomogeneously - broadened optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this is because these methods are based on _ fluctuations and correlations _ , rather than on measurement of the standard time - averaged response functions that are measured by conventional linear optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> though demonstrated here for the specific case of semiconductor qds and spin fluctuations , the general principle should be broadly applicable to many classes of systems and materials in which intrinsic fluctuations can be detected  and may prove especially attractive for those systems where the individual constituents can not easily be isolated , or for which intense non - linear perturbation is undesired . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these noise - based techniques can equally well be applied to  and have great promise for  studies of correlations in _ interacting _ systems , such as coupled quantum - dot or nanocrystal systems , spin - exchange interactions in atomic gases , or spin - spin interactions in chemical and biological systems . </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting extension of these ideas is to measure not only temporal but also _ spatial _ correlations of systems exhibiting collective excitation ( _ e.g. _ magnon , plasmon , or polariton systems ) , by two or more probes with tunable spatial separation @xcite . </S>"
