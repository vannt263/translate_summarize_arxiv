    "in the standard model ( sm ) , lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) decays of charged leptons are forbidden or highly suppressed even if neutrino mixing is taken into account  @xcite .",

    "the requirement of lepton identification for all three charged tracks on the signal side leads to significant background reduction by a factor in the range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 for each decay mode with a 40% loss of signal .",
