    "the abc effect , which shows an unexpected peak in the invariant @xmath2@xmath2-mass spectrum of the double pionic @xmath11-@xmath12 fusion to @xmath13 process , was observed by abashian , booth and crowe long ago@xcite .",
    "later on , in the hadronic experiment , such a phenomenon was also observed in the other processes , for instance @xmath14 + @xmath12 @xmath15 @xmath11(@xmath2@xmath2 )  @xcite and @xmath11 + @xmath11 @xmath15 @xmath16(@xmath2@xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath2-production mechanism used to be attributed to the effect of the double @xmath17 excitation .",
    "but it was found that the obtained enhancement in the low @xmath2@xmath2 mass region in the exclusive @xmath18@xmath18 channel is much smaller than the data value  @xcite , which implies that some important physics is missing in such a mechanism .",
    "thus , a sequential mechanism was proposed to explain the deuteron spectrum of the @xmath14 + @xmath12 @xmath15 @xmath11(@xmath2@xmath2 ) process , namely the nucleon can firstly be excited into roper resonance @xmath19(1440 ) , and then the resonance decays into @xmath20@xmath2@xmath2 and @xmath17@xmath2 subsequently  @xcite .    on the other hand , the deuteron is a unique b=2 state which has been confirmed in the experiment at this moment , where b stands for the baryon number . actually , after three decades of experimental efforts",
    ", we have never found any decisive sign for the existence of a b=2 state other than the deuteron .",
    "recently , the celsius - wasa collaboration observed a narrow resonance - like structure around 2360 mev in the data set of the @xmath0 total cross section  @xcite .",
    "since such an energy is fairly close to the @xmath21 threshold , and @xmath7 has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath22 system and would couple to @xmath22 strongly , this phenomenon awakens our interest in exploring the possible existence of a @xmath21 quasi - molecular state , which is an analogue of the deuteron .    in order to carry out such a study , the hadron - hadron interaction should be known before hand .",
    "the hadron - hadron interaction used to be studied in the hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "since the qcd theory emerged in the 1970s , such an interaction has further been investigated in the quark degrees of freedom , where the hadron - hadron system is considered as a multi - quark cluster system .",
    "one of the models in this category , which can basically explain the experiment data , is called constituent quark model ( cqm ) . in this model",
    ", the quark - quark interaction can be described by the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) potential in the short - range , the scalar- and pseudoscalar - meson - exchange potentials in the medium - range interaction , and the phenomenological confinement potential in the long - range .    however , because of the property of the non - abelian group , the non - perturbative effect of qcd still can not be taken into account accurately up to now . for simplicity and efficiency ,",
    "the method in the framework of the hadron degrees of freedom is still widely used in the hadron physics investigation . in this framework ,",
    "the hadron is assumed as a point - like particle , and the hadron - hadron interaction is supposed to be originated from exchanges of various mesons whose masses and coupling forms with various hadrons are different . a typical theoretical model is the bonn meson - exchange model which has intensively been studied over years . by employing this model , a large amount of nucleon - nucleon interaction data , such as the deuteron property , scattering phase shifts and reaction cross sections ,",
    "can be well described  @xcite .",
    "this model has also been adopted to study the baryon - baryon interaction in the coupled channel approach , although the result was not accurate enough due to too much approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently , a simplified one - pion - exchange model was used to study systematically the deuteron - like meson - meson bound state , called deuson , some possible @xmath23-wave molecular - like states in the meson - meson interaction were predicted  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of @xmath24 with a nucleon was studied from the viewpoint of chiral dynamics and a possible quasi - bound state was found  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the bonn meson - exchange model is extended to the @xmath1(1440 ) system so that the binding property of the system can be studied .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : the derivation of the non - relativistic @xmath20-@xmath19(1440)potential is briefly introduced in section ii , and the model parameters are extracted from the available data in section iii . in section iv , the numerical result and discussion are given .",
    "finally , the summary is presented in section v.",
    "the basic feynman diagrams of the @xmath20-@xmath7 interaction are shown in fig.[feynman ] .    in the bonn meson - exchange model ,",
    "there are six mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to be considered .",
    "recently , by fitting the experimental data , one showed that only four of them , namely @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , have relatively large coupling with @xmath1(1440 )  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson exchanges would be responsible the the long - range ( @xmath27@xmath282 fm ) and the intermediate - range(1 @xmath29@xmath27@xmath302 fm ) interactions , respectively , and the @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson exchanges would provide the core - range(@xmath27@xmath301 fm ) interaction .",
    "the effective lagrangians of the meson-@xmath20-@xmath19(1440 ) interaction for various mesons read @xmath31 the forms of the effective lagrangians of the meson-@xmath20-@xmath20 or meson-@xmath32-@xmath32 interaction are the same as those of the meson-@xmath20-@xmath7 interaction , except the spinor .",
    "now , we consider a @xmath10(1440 ) system whose quantum numbers are the same as those of the deuteron , namely @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath32 is also an isospin doublet , one can write the @xmath35 or @xmath36 state as @xmath37 consequently , one can further write the wave function of the @xmath10(1440 ) system as @xmath38 . \\label{eq : norm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently , each term in the above equation contains four non - equivalent feynman diagrams .",
    "all together , eq.([eq : norm ] ) contains eight non - equivalent feynman diagrams , as shown in fig.[non - equivalence ] . among them , the first four are @xmath39-channel diagrams and the rest are @xmath40-channel diagrams .",
    "next , we derive the @xmath20-@xmath32 potential for the above mentioned diagrams according to the quantum scattering theory .",
    "the relativistic s - matrix for a scattering process reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the scattering amplitude from the @xmath43 state to the @xmath44 state , or the lorentz - invariant matrix element between the @xmath43 state and the @xmath44 state . on the other hand , by applying bonn approximation on the lippmann - schwinger equation , the s - matrix reads @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the interaction potential . considering the different normalization conventions used for the scattering amplitude @xmath42 and for the @xmath47-matrix @xmath48 , and consequently @xmath46 , we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the four momentum of the final ( initial ) state .",
    "let us use , in the center mass system , @xmath51 and @xmath52 to represent the four momenta of the initial particles , @xmath53 and @xmath54 to denote the four momenta of the final particles , respectively .",
    "and then , @xmath55 should be the transferred four momentum or the four momentum of the meson propagator .",
    "for convenience , we always use @xmath56 and @xmath57 instead of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the practical calculation .    in terms of the feynman rules",
    ", the dirac spinor @xmath60 @xmath61 and the nonrealistic reduction @xmath62 the scattering amplitude caused by the @xmath2-meson exchange can be written as @xmath63 and the scattering amplitude induced by the @xmath3-meson exchange can be expressed by @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ & & -g^2_{\\sigma nn^*(1440)}\\frac{1}{\\vec{q}^{2}+m^{2}_\\sigma}[1-\\frac{1}{2 m_1 m_2}\\vec{k}^{2}+ \\frac{1}{8 m_1 m_2}\\vec{q}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2 m_1 m_2}i\\vec{s}\\cdot(\\vec{q}\\times\\vec{k})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the scattering amplitudes arisen from the @xmath5- and @xmath4-meson exchanges can be derived in the same way .",
    "their forms are quite similar to those of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson exchanges . to reduce the length of the paper ,",
    "they will not be presented here .",
    "it should be mentioned that because of the mass difference between @xmath20 and @xmath32 , there would be a so - called `` _ effective mass _ ''",
    "@xmath65 in the amplitude formula @xmath66 @xmath67 moreover , in the derivation , the term with symmetric combination @xmath68 which leads to a spin - orbital term @xmath69 is remained , while the term with asymmetric combination @xmath70 is dropped .",
    "substituting @xmath42 into eq.([eq : vq ] ) , a meson - exchange potential in the momentum space , @xmath71 , can be obtained .",
    "further making fourier - transformation , the @xmath20-@xmath32(1440 ) potential in the coordinate space , @xmath72 , can be derived .",
    "it should be pointed out that because the mass of the @xmath2-meson is relatively small , the fourier transformation of the @xmath2-meson - exchange potential would be a complex function , which implies that the off - shell effect of the exchanged pion would induce other reaction channels . since what we are interested in",
    "is the elastic scattering , as an approximation , the imaginary part of the potential can temporarily be dropped , which is consistent with the treatment in ref.@xcite . for instance , @xmath73\\ ] ] with @xmath74    considering the finite size effect of @xmath20 ( @xmath32 ) , similar to the derivation of the bonn potential , a form factor @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the cutoff parameter and @xmath77 is adopted to suppress the high momentum contribution in the relatively lower energy scattering .",
    "then the ultraviolet divergence in the fourier transformation can be eliminated , and the potential in the coordinate space at small @xmath27 is remained finite . finally , the potential of the @xmath20-@xmath32(1440 ) interaction can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the total central , spin - orbital and tensor potentials , @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{g^{2}_{\\pi nn^*(1440)}}{4\\pi}\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^2}{16m^{2}_1m^{2}_2 } [ ~(\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2})\\mathcal{f}_{6u1 } + s_{12}\\mathcal{f}_{6u2}~],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{g^{2}_{\\sigma nn^*}}{4\\pi}[~-\\mathcal{f}_{1u}+ \\frac{1}{2m_1m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u } -\\frac{1}{8m_1m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2u } + \\frac{1}{2m_1m_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5u0}~],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{\\rho nn^*}}{2m_1 + 2m_2}\\frac{g_{\\rho nn^*}}{4\\pi}[~\\frac{3}{m_1}\\mathcal{f}_{2 t } -\\frac{6(m_1+m_2)}{m_1m_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5t0}+\\frac{3\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}}{m_2 } ( \\mathcal{f}_{2t}-\\mathcal{f}_{3t1})-\\frac{3s_{12}}{m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{3t2}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{\\rho n^*n^*}}{2m_1 + 2m_2}\\frac{g_{\\rho nn}}{4\\pi}[~\\frac{3}{m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2 t } -\\frac{6(m_1+m_2)}{m_1m_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5t0}+\\frac{3\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}}{m_1 } ( \\mathcal{f}_{2t}-\\mathcal{f}_{3t1})-\\frac{3s_{12}}{m_1}\\mathcal{f}_{3t2}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{\\rho n^*n^*}}{(2m_1 + 2m_2)^2}\\frac{f_{\\rho nn}}{4\\pi}[~12\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2 } ( \\mathcal{f}_{2t}-\\mathcal{f}_{3t1})-12s_{12}\\mathcal{f}_{3t2}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{g^{2}_{\\rho n^*n}}{4\\pi}[~-3\\mathcal{f}_{1u}- \\frac{3m^{2}_1 + 3m^{2}_2 + 12m_1m_2}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u } + \\frac{3m^{2}_1 + 3m^{2}_2}{16m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{3m^{2}_1 + 3m^{2}_2 + 3m_1m_2}{2m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5u0 } -\\frac{3(m_1-m_2)^2}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\mathcal{f}_4u\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^2}{16m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2 } ( \\mathcal{f}_{2u}-\\mathcal{f}_{3u1})-\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^2}{16m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}s_{12}\\mathcal{f}_{3u2}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{g^{2}_{\\rho n^*n}}{4\\pi}\\frac{(m_1-m_2)^2}{m^{2}_\\rho}[~3\\mathcal{f}_{1u}- \\frac{3}{2m_1m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u}+\\frac{3}{8m_1m_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2u } -\\frac{3}{2m_1m_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5u0}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{\\rho nn^*}}{2m_1 + 2m_2}\\frac{g_{\\rho nn^*}}{4\\pi}[~ -\\frac{3(m_1-m_2)^2(m_1+m_2)}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u } + \\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^3}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{6(m_1+m_2)(m^{2}_1+m^{2}_2)}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5u0 } -\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)(m_1-m_2)^{2}}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^3}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}(\\mathcal{f}_{2u}-\\mathcal{f}_{3u1 } ) -\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^3}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}s_{12}\\mathcal{f}_{3u2}~]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f^{2}_{\\rho n^*n}}{4\\pi(2m_1 + 2m_2)^2}[~-\\frac{3(m_1-m_2)^{4}}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u } + \\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^2(m_1-m_2)^2}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\mathcal{f}_{2u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{6(m_1+m_2)^2(m_1-m_2)^2}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{l}\\mathcal{f}_{5u0 } -\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^2(m_1-m_2)^{2}}{m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\mathcal{f}_{4u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^{4}}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma_2}(\\mathcal{f}_{2u}-\\mathcal{f}_{3u1 } ) -\\frac{3(m_1+m_2)^{4}}{4m^{2}_1m^{2}_2}s_{12}\\mathcal{f}_{3u2}~]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85 represent the potentials induced by the @xmath2- , @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson exchanges , respectively .",

    "because the deeply bound state of @xmath10(1440 ) with a binding energy of about a few hundred mev is close to the energy level of the deuteron , it might couple to the conventional deuteron to form a realistic deuteron .",

    "<S> inspired by the recent observation of a narrow resonance - like structure around 2360 mev in the @xmath0 cross section , the possibility of forming a @xmath1(1440 ) quasi - molecular state is investigated by using a meson exchange model in which the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchanges in t- and u - channels are considered . by adopting the coupling constants extracted from the relevant @xmath6 scattering and @xmath7 decay data , it is found that a deuteron - like quasi - molecular state of @xmath8 with a binding energy in the range of @xmath9 can be formed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is speculated that the observed structure around 2360 mev might be or may have a large component of the @xmath10(1440 ) quasi - molecular state . </S>"
