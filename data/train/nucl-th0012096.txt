    "<S> @xcite and references therein . that the @xmath24pt values for the iso - scalar polarisabilities are consistent with compton scattering data on the deuteron was demonstrated in two effective field theory ( eft ) nlo calculations in extensions of @xmath24pt to the few nucleon system , one using perturbative pions  @xcite , one using non - perturbative pions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present calculation is unique in the sense that all the theoretical approximations are explicit and controlled , up to the order of the perturbative eft calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the polarisabilities extracted from this calculation are independent of any modelling of the short - distance dynamics of nucleons inside a deuteron or any heavy nucleus . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , they are independent of assumptions about the pion - nucleon interaction , independent of the form of the inter - nucleon potential , manifestly independent of the photon coupling to nucleons and pions as extended objects and independent of the choice of regulator . </S>",

    "<S> then , the amplitude and cross section is presented . </S>",
    "<S> finally , various fits of the polarisabilities to data are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed presentation will be given in an upcoming article  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is in the context of the few - nucleon eft in which nucleons and photons are the only dynamical degrees of freedom  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation can be viewed as a systematisation of effective range theory to include interactions with gauge fields , and relativistic and short - distance effects . </S>",
    "<S> contributions from pions and other , heavier degrees of freedom are included at low energy through multiple - nucleon - photon contact interactions in perturbation . since one can not apply this eft at energies where cuts in the amplitude are probed due to pion propagation , meson exchange etc . , the natural breakdown scale @xmath26 is the pion mass @xmath27 . for details of the formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to a recent review  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> efts live from the fact that at low energies , a separation of scales exists : like the binding momentum of the deuteron @xmath28 , the photon momentum @xmath29 and energy @xmath30 are much smaller than @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> there is another `` high - energy '' scale , namely the iso - spin averaged nucleon mass @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , each physical low energy observable at a typical momentum scale @xmath32 is expanded systematically in powers of two small parameters : @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for convenience , we formally identify @xmath35 , which is accidentally valid . </S>",
    "<S> thus , relativistic corrections with a typical size @xmath36 contribute at @xmath37 , i.e.  n@xmath38lo , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the centre - of - mass photon energy @xmath0 and the conversion of relativistic photon energies to non - relativistic nucleon energies introduce new scales : @xmath0 and @xmath39 . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we make some integral approximations that allow us to effortlessly move from one rgime to another with one simple expression  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the power counting reveals that the vector and tensor amplitudes start contributing to the unpolarised cross section only at n@xmath54lo . </S>",

    "<S> we now proceed to determine the polarisabilities from compton scattering data at @xmath6  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> estimates of the nlo corrections in @xmath24pt seem to favour the electric and magnetic polarisabilities to have about the same size : resonance saturation suggests @xmath106 and @xmath107  @xcite , and treating the @xmath108 as dynamical degree of freedom leads to @xmath109 , @xmath110  @xcite . in the next step , </S>",
    "<S> we therefore fit both @xmath3 and @xmath4 as free parameters , resulting in @xmath111 and @xmath112 , again with large error bars from a two parameter fit to four data points . </S>",
    "<S> the first error comes from the fit , the second is the estimate of the theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> however , the well measured baldin sum rule constrains @xmath113  @xcite which is also comfortably close to the sum of the polarisabilities from the nave two - parameter fit . utilising the sum rule , we find @xmath114 and hence @xmath115 in a one parameter fit , with the best @xmath103 of all the three procedures . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , the baldin sum rule gives the sum of the polarisabilities only at zero photon energy , while the polarisabilities are extracted at @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we assume that corrections are small  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ comptonfit.fig ] compares the three fits to scattering data .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation presented here is formally accurate to @xmath117 , i.e.  to within @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> however , numerically the result might be slightly better as some contributions with sizes comparable to n@xmath119lo are already included in ( [ comptonnloe.eq ] ) and ( [ comptonnnlof.eq ] ) and the polarisabilities are by far the biggest n@xmath76locontributions . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ comptonfit.fig ] compares the strengths of the diagrams , confirming the power counting and demonstrating convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we can for example leave out the @xmath120 contribution fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagrams.fig ] ( f ) which acts like a large n@xmath121lo correction , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ comptonfit.fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> this enhances the electric polarisability using the baldin sum rule to @xmath122 and reduces @xmath4 accordingly . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , one might expect that wave function renormalisation effects on the polarisability diagrams are large because @xmath123 is large for a nlo effect . </S>",
    "<S> still , the fit using the baldin sum rule then induces only small changes in the polarisabilities , @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our extraction at @xmath125 to be about @xmath5 and refer to @xcite for further discussion . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental uncertainty is at present higher than the theoretical error because of the comparatively high error bars in the only available low energy compton scattering data .    including the theoretical uncertainties in our calculation ( @xmath126 ) and in the value of the baldin sum rule </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath127 , @xmath128 , where the first error comes from the fit , the second one is the theoretical uncertainty of our n@xmath76localculation , and the third comes from applying the baldin sum rule . for curiosity , we note that these values are also well consistent with the two urbana data points at @xmath129  @xcite which give using the baldin sum rule @xmath130 , @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> we finally extract for the neutron polarisabilities @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where the first number in parentheses comes from the free fit , and the second from the fit using the baldin sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> we quote no errors since they are large mainly due to the large experimental uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> higher values for @xmath134 seem slightly favoured  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap between our extraction of the polarisabilities and the @xmath24pt results is well known , see e.g.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be traced back to the fact that the compton scattering data at large angles is systematically more and more enhanced over forward scattering as the photon energy is increased  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this favours larger values of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the scarcity of data at low energies is a big hindrance , the comparison of the present calculation to experiment shows that it is quite appropriate to determine neutron scalar polarisabilities from low energy compton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> our approach uses eft and hence it is model - independent and allows one to estimate the theoretical accuracy as @xmath135 for the polarisabilities , assuming higher order contributions are of natural size . </S>",
    "<S> future higher precision experiments e.g.  at tunl in the energy rgime @xmath136 would be most useful . as one can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ comptonfit.fig ] , at lower photon energies , the polarisability contributions become smaller than n@xmath76lo , while higher energies introduce large theoretical errors since corrections going like @xmath137 are not suppressed sufficiently strong any more . </S>",
    "<S> the energy rgime proposed is hence an interesting window of opportunity to determine nucleon polarisabilities in a model - independent way without having to deal with pions as explicit degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> small angle scattering data constrains @xmath138 and hence can serve as a cross check to the baldin sum rule , whereas backscattering data probes @xmath139 and hence is needed for a better determination of @xmath4 . in a future publication  @xcite , we will address details of the calculation as well as a more accurate estimate of n@xmath121lo effects . </S>",
    "<S> the only undetermined operators entering at n@xmath121lo are @xmath140 with projections @xmath141 onto the @xmath142 channel . </S>",
    "<S> these operators contribute to residual electric and magnetic deuteron polarisabilities , i.e.  to those not generated by polarisation of the two nucleons against each other or by polarising the nucleons themselves . </S>"
