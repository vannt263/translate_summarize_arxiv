    "asca observations of the egret error box revealed an extended x - ray source @xcite , suggestive of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "a 9.7ks _ chandra _ acis exposure in august 2000 @xcite revealed a point source connected to the non - thermal x - ray / radio nebula , bolstering the pwn identification .",
    "@xcite then described g7.5@xmath01.7 , a partial @xmath4 radius radio shell and possible supernova remnant ; the center of this snr candidate lies @xmath5 from the point source , in the general direction defined by the pwn trail .",
    "the psr / pwn nature of the source was confirmed by the discovery of psr j1809@xmath02332 , a @xmath6ms , @xmath7ky pulsar discovered by blind search of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) @xmath8-ray photons @xcite .",

    "selected pulsars , we lack a dispersion measure estimate of the distance .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the diffuse x - ray emission is anti - correlated with molecular gas in the lynds 227 dark cloud ; if associated this implies a plausible @xmath10 1.8 kpc .    to test the snr association and to improve spectral and morphological measurements of the diffuse emission",
    ", we have obtained a new _ chandra _ acis exposure . by carefully matching to the original pointing ,",
    "we have minimized systematic effects and allowed excellent frame - referencing and astrometry of the point source .",
    "the @xmath11y baseline between the exposures thus allows a sensitive study of the proper motion and origin of psr j1809@xmath02332 .",

    "psr j1809@xmath02332 was observed on july 28 , 2011 ( obsid 12546 ) for 29.7 ks in timed vfaint mode . as for our august 16 ,",
    "2000 exposure ( obsid 739 ) we used the acis - i array . to minimize changes in the reference star psfs ( see below ) we matched the roll angle to the 2000 epoch .",
    "the point source position was not , of course , known in the initial exposure and fell rather close to a chip boundary .",
    "we thus shifted the pointing @xmath12 in each coordinate to move the point source further onto the i3 chip and improve measurement of diffuse emission in its vicinity .",
    "the data were analyzed with ciao 4.3 , after re - processing both frames to the most current acis calibration .",
    "no flaring occurred during obsid 12546 , so the full 29.7ks was used . for obsid 739 ,",
    "the full 9.7ks was also usable .",
    "after combining , exposure correcting ( with _ fluximage _ ) and adaptive smoothing , the acis - i frame gives a good overall view of the pulsar vicinity ( figure 1 ) .",
    "there is appreciable diffuse x - ray emission across the center of the image .",
    "the pulsar point source lies near the apex of a patch of brighter nebulosity that trails off to the north - west for @xmath13 . on smaller scales",
    "the pwn has a bright core behind the pulsar , @xmath14 extension transverse to this trail at the point source and fainter diffuse emission ` ahead ' of the pulsar . to the south of the pulsar ,",

    "to best constrain any pulsar proper motion , we must optimally register the two observation epochs , using field point sources .",
    "we identify these using the ciao wavdetect tool , selecting sources with a significance @xmath755 in both observations .",
    "the young s32 star cluster @xmath76 due south of the pulsar provides the bulk of the reference stars ; inevitably several bright stars fall into chip gaps in one or the other of the observations , precluding their use .",
    "this leaves 14 stellar sources , plus the pulsar .",
    "we label the reference stars by increasing physical pixel x - coordinate ( decreasing ra ) , mark these in figure [ fig : f1a ] and tabulate the wavdetect pixel positions and significances for each epoch in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the wavdetect tool uses `` mexican hat '' wavelet functions of different scales to generate a source list and estimate position",
    ". this approximation may be inadequate far from the acis aimpoint where the mirror psf induces substantial and systematic changes in the point source count distribution . by approximately matching the pointing and roll angle we have kept the change in such distortions minimal between the two frames .",
    "nevertheless the psf shape changes across the frame are very large and the majority of our reference stars lie @xmath77 from the aimpoint and pulsar .",
    "we have improved the astrometric accuracy and further reduced the effect of psf variation by creating a simulated psf for each point source and using these to fit the source position .",
    "[ fig : f2 ]    we extract the spectrum of each source with the specextract function , fitting the stellar point sources to an absorbed mekal plasma model , and save this spectrum within the sherpa plotting program with the save@xmath0chart@xmath0spectrum command .",
    "after re - scaling by @xmath78 to improve psf modeling statistics , the spectra are passed to chart , which is a web interface to the saosac raytrace code .",
    "chart also takes as input the exposure time as well as the source position , which is assumed to be the wavdetect position .",
    "the output of chart is subsequently input into marx to create model psf events files at each source position , corrected for the offset of the science instrument module ( sim ) from the nominal location .",
    "the modeled source events are binned to @xmath79 of the native acis pixel resolution and recorded in 320@xmath80320 image files .",
    "these are compared with data cut - outs with matched 40@xmath8040 native - pixel images .",
    "psf models and data cutouts are prepared for each star in both frames .",
    "we use these to solve for psf _ vs. _ data position shifts .",
    "the fitting program uses a maximum likelihood ` figure of merit ' ( fom , the negative ln poisson probability of getting the observed data counts from the model psf ) , where we run a grid of trial positions shifted at the 1/8-pixel psf model resolutions and sum the model counts to the observed acis pixel .",
    "the result is a map of source likelihood in psf position shift @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( relative to the nominal wavdetect location ) .",
    "an example of the cut - out , psf model and shift map are shown in figure 2 .    in order to compute the best - fit position of the source",
    ", we fit an elliptic paraboloid to the fom surface .",
    "the minimum of this surface determines the best fit offset , and the offset error is estimated from the @xmath83fom contours . as with source 8 , several of the ellipses had large axis ratios .",
    "however an attempt to improve registration by fitting along major and minor axis did not reduce the scatter .",
    "thus to be conservative , we project the ellipses to the @xmath81 and @xmath82 pixel axes and fit in this unrotated space . we determine that @xmath84 ( wavdetect ) errors correspond to a @xmath85 , and thus ascribe @xmath84 error ellipses to the region enclosed by this fom increase above the fit minimum .",

    "are shown by the green ellipse in figure 2 .",
    "table 2 gives the psf - fit computed pixel offset of each source from the wavdetect position , along with estimates for the position errors .",

    "similar values are computed for the y coordinate .    inspection of the tables shows that source 3 has both a large shift between frames and a large psf - fit error .",
    "we suspect that it may be a confused double with variable components ( hence the poor psf fit and large apparent shift ) .",
    "we thus omit this star from the registration , leaving 13 field stars .",
    "we also attempted recursive pruning of field stars with the largest remaining @xmath122 or @xmath123 ; as expected the nominal fit errors decreased slightly ( especially for the psf - fit solution ) .",
    "however the shifts were small and decreasing the number of fit stars may increase sensitivity to systematics .",
    "we thus conservatively retain all stars except the obvious outlier source 3 and report the best - fit shifts and shift errors in table [ tab : frameshift ] .",
    "although many of our reference stars are from the s32 cluster , comparison with the non - cluster stars does not show any large systematic shifts .",
    "this is as expected since typical @xmath124km / s association velocities are small compared to the expected pulsar space velocity , as is the velocity due to differential galactic rotation , for the expected distances .",
    "table [ tab : frameshift ] lists the best - fit frame shifts for both the raw wavdetect positions and the psf fit positions . in both cases , we compute shifts only , adopting the _ cxo_-determined roll angle .",
    "the net pixel shifts are consistent between the two methods .",
    "however , the @xmath125 and frame offset errors are significantly smaller for the psf - fit approach .",
    "figure [ fig : pos2 ] shows why : the scatter of the psf - fit position offsets about the best - fit line is smaller , with the exception of the obvious outlier source 3 .",
    "we thus adopt the psf - fit measurements and offset .",
    "these finally allow us to compute the position shift ( relative to the psf - fit registration ) of the pulsar between the two frames .",
    "the values for both wavdetect and improved psf - fit detect centroiding are shown in table [ tab : psroffset ] .",
    "this table also gives the best fit radial ( in native acis pixel units ) and pa shifts with propagated errors . in figure 4",

    "as noted in section 3 we also extracted point - source spectra and fit absorbed mekal models to the obvious stellar sources to derive spectra for computing model psfs .",

    "table [ tab : spec ] gives the fit values and 68% confidence errors .",
    "if we assume a common origin for the various components we can improve the spectral constraints by fitting for a global @xmath151 . using the brightest diffuse regions ( trail + inner nebula ) we obtain @xmath152 and fix this for the other spectral regions . the galactic hi surveys ( nhtool ) show a column of @xmath153 to @xmath154kpc suggesting a source distance @xmath155 kpc .",
    "[ fig : specregs ]    for the point source ( neutron star ) , we first attempted a joint bb+pl fit , but found that the pl index was driven to very soft values @xmath156 , indicating a poor fit to the thermal spectrum .",
    "if fixed at a more physical @xmath157 the fit is unacceptable .",
    "however , if we adopt a neutron star atmosphere model ( sherpa model xsnsa ) we obtain a reasonable reduced @xmath125 and powerlaw index .",
    "this model includes a number of parameters , three of which we fix : neutron star gravitation mass = @xmath158 , neutron star radius = 10 km , neutron star magnetic field = @xmath159 g. the remaining variables are the effective temperature and model normalization .",
    "the model normalization provides an estimate of the pulsar distance , which for the fitted parameters yields @xmath160 kpc .",
    "this distance estimate is not very meaningful since , as usual , the thermal emission likely has contributions from a heated polar cap or soft magnetospheric power law . with the addition of such components the inferred distance increases",

    "the diffuse spectral indices are not atypical of hard pwn emission .",
    "we do not see any clear systematic softening as one moves farther from the pulsar .",
    "however both the ` upstream ' region and the ` outer neb -s ' appear significantly softer than the rest of the nebula .",
    "this is especially true if @xmath151 is allowed to vary , when somewhat larger @xmath161 values are preferred .",
    "the upstream emission is difficult to explain given the detected proper motion of the pulsar , unless it represents a foreground or background structure .",

    "the pulsar projected offset is only @xmath216% of the snr radius , so if the pwn lies in the snr interior it may be just passing from being ` crushed ' by the reverse shock to forming a well - defined bow shock @xcite .",

    "certainly the bulk of the hard spectrum emission trails the pulsar , following the proper motion axis and the direction to the explosion site .",
    "however , there are significant counts bracketing the point source and extending @xmath217 _ transverse _ to the pulsar motion . since the pulsar spin axis appears to correlate with the proper motion @xcite such transverse extension tends to be equatorial .",
    "it is tempting to infer that the blocky pwn head is the result of an anisotropic pulsar wind , concentrated in an equatorial torus , with a spin axis / earth line - of - sight angle @xmath218 , i.e. a torus viewed at large inclination angle .",

    "tpc - type models produce such @xmath223 for a wide range of @xmath224 , but many of the solutions should be radio detected . thus both model classes are allowed , although an outer - gap type interpretation seems preferred .",
    "a good measurement of @xmath225 from a detailed map of the pwn head could check this interpretation , but would require a rather long acis exposure .",
    "looking ahead of this transverse structure , we see that the hard spectrum diffuse emission has a fairly abrupt cutoff at @xmath226 ( figure 1b ) .",
    "we can compare this with the standoff angle for an isotropic ram - pressure confined pulsar wind @xmath227 for our measured proper motion , an ambient number density @xmath228 and a distance 1.8kpc .",
    "it seems that a small standoff is not unexpected , but given the apparent anisotropy in the wind momentum and likely anisotropy in the snr interior , no strong conclusions should be drawn .",
    "of course there is emission ` upstream ' , ahead of the pulsar motion .",
    "the chip gap spanned this region in the 2000 data so it was difficult to draw morphological conclusions . in the combined data it seems that this emission is morphologically distinct to , and substantially softer than , the pwn trail .",
    "this larger - scale soft emission is also seen in archival _ xmm _ and _ asca _ data where it also appears distinct from the harder pwn trail . in our data",
    "it appears to connect to the `` outer neb - s '' region , so we can posit that this extended softer emission may be a background or foreground structure associated with the host snr . if the absorption is left free , these regions seem to prefer a slightly higher @xmath151 than the central pwn . given the extensive patchy molecular gas and obscuration in this region , these small differences are not particularly telling .",
    "we have examined a new _ chandra _ acis exposure of psr j1809@xmath02332 to study the fine scale x - ray morphology .",
    "comparison with the 2000 exposure yields a @xmath229 detection of the pulsar proper motion and supports the association with snr g7.5@xmath01.7 .",
    "the pwn has slightly extended emission at the apex , somewhat larger than expected from a bow shock . while this suggests that the pulsar wind is concentrated transverse to its velocity , the possibility of anisotropies in the snr interior discourages strong conclusions and such disturbed morphology is not unexpected .",
    "overall , however , these new data support a basic picture for the psr j1809@xmath02332 system : a @xmath230ky pulsar viewed near the spin equator , but with small magnetic inclination so that the radio beam misses the earth .",
    "the pulsar , traveling at @xmath231 , is followed by a trail of hard pwn x - ray emission and is approaching the outer region of its composite host snr located at @xmath232kpc .",
