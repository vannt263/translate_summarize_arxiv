    "<S> this paper is concerned with the mathematical design of a novel input / instruction device using a moving emitter . </S>",
    "<S> the emitter generates a point source and can be installed on a digit pen or worn on the finger of the human being who wants to interact / communicate with the computer . </S>",
    "<S> the input / instruction can be recognized by identifying the motion trajectory of the emitter performed by the human being from the collected wave field data . </S>",
    "<S> the identification process is modelled as an inverse source problem where one intends to identify the trajectory of a moving point source . </S>",
    "<S> there are several salient features of our study which distinguish our result from the existing ones in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> first , the point source is moving in an inhomogeneous background medium , which models the human body . </S>",
    "<S> second , the dynamical wave field data are collected in a limited aperture . </S>",
    "<S> third , the reconstruction method is independent of the background medium , and it is totally direct without any matrix inversion . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is efficient and robust with respect to the measurement noise . </S>",
    "<S> both theoretical justifications and computational experiments are presented to verify our novel findings .    </S>",
