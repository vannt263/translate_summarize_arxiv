    "<S> it is often necessary to evaluate large arrays of generalized bessel functions , of arbitrary index but with fixed arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the generalized bessel function can be evaluated , in a numerically stable way , by utilizing a recurrence relation and a normalization condition only , without having to compute any initial value . </S>",
