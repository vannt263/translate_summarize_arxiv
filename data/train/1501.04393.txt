    "giga - hertz  peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources represent at least 10% cent of the bright radio source population ( odea 1998 ) and are thought to represent the early evolutionary stages of the fr - ii , and perhaps fr - i , radio galaxies ( e.g. , snellen et al .",
    "high angular resolution studies are therefore of great importance for understanding the early stages of their evolution , particularly for low - redshift gps galaxies where high angular resolution corresponds to high linear resolution .",
    "multi - frequency observations additionally allow the spectral index distribution to be studied : flat or inverted spectra identify regions of active particle acceleration , whereas steeper spectra are consistent with an aging population of relativistic electrons ( although these interpretations can be complicated in high density regions by the effects of absorption ) .    multi - frequency , multi - epoch observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ( tingay et  al .",
    "2003a ) established pks  b2254@xmath0367 as a gps source .",
    "in addition to the peaked radio spectrum , pks  b2254@xmath0367 displays all of the typical characteristics of gps sources , with compact structure seen on the maximum atca 6 km baselines , low fractional polarisation , and low variability over the 3.5 year period of the atca monitoring ( tingay , edwards & tzioumis 2003b ; edwards & tingay 2004 ) .",
    "in general , gps objects have marginal variability , representing the variations due to the evolution of a jet originating from a black hole and accretion disk system . in gps objects ,",
    "the contribution to the total flux density of the jet is small in fractional terms , leading to low levels of variability .",
    "long term gradual flux density variability has been reported for oq208 ( wu et al .",
    "pks2254@xmath0367 has a more irregular variability , similar to high frequency peaking gps objects ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "observations at 20ghz ( murphy et al .",
    "2010 ) and 95ghz ( sadler et al .  2008 ) confirm the pks 2254@xmath0367 spectral index steepens beyond 8.6ghz ( the highest frequency of the original atca observations ) .    assuming a hubble constant of 75 kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 and correcting for the motion of our galaxy in the direction of pks 2254@xmath0367 relative to the cosmic microwave background , the pks 2254@xmath0367 redshift ( 0.006011 , @xcite ) indicates a distance of 20.5mpc .",
    "pks  2254@xmath0367 is therefore one of the closest known gps radio sources .",
    "ngc  1052 ( z=0.005037 ) at 17.2mpc and pks  1718@xmath0649 ( ngc  6328 : 0.014428 ) at 59mpc , in the same frame of reference , are the only two other gps radio sources within 100mpc , for which the detailed kinematics of the host galaxies can be studied ( see , e.g. , labiano et al .",
    "all three galaxies present strong evidence for merger activity , an actively fuelled black hole , and high density environments with which the radio sources interact ( tingay et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the host galaxy of pks  b2254@xmath0367 , ic  1459 , is a giant elliptical galaxy in a loose group of spirals .",
    "ic  1459 is a liner ( verdoes kleijn et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and has one of the strongest counter - rotating core components of any observed elliptical , suggestive of merger activity ( forbes , franx , and illingworth 1994 ) . the dust distribution is irregular near the nucleus , indicating that infalling material may currently be fuelling the active nucleus ( forbes et  al .",
    "the central black hole mass in ic 1459 is between @xmath5m@xmath6 and @xmath7m@xmath6 ( cappellari et  al .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of pks 2254@xmath0367 were made using the vlba ( excluding the northernmost stations at brewster , north liberty and hancock ) at frequencies of 1.655 and 4.975 ghz on 2003 november 29 and at frequencies of 2.266 and 8.416 ghz on 2003 december 11 .",
    "standard observing setups , with two - bit quantisation , were used .",
    "the 1.7 and 5.0ghz observations switched between these two bands on a 15 minute timescale over the 6 hour duration of the observation .",
    "a 32 mhz aggregate bandwidth was used at lcp .",
    "the 2.3 and 8.4ghz observations used the dual `` s / x '' band receiver to record rcp .",
    "switching between these frequencies was therefore not required , as both are available simultaneously . in this case , the aggregate bandwidth per band is half of that which is available for the 1.7 and 5.0ghz observations , but the integration time is approximately doubled .",
    "the data were correlated on the vlba processor and initial standard data reduction was performed in aips , according to standard routines ( amplitude calibration , instrumental phase and delay calibration , fringe - fitting etc ) .",
    "the data were then exported to difmap ( shepherd 1997 ) for editing , imaging , and modelfitting of the ( @xmath8 ) data .",
    "the aims of imaging the data at the maximum possible angular resolution , to investigate the structure of the compact radio source , and to obtain quantitative information on the spectral properties of the source structure , are difficult to achieve given the poor ( @xmath8 ) coverage of the vlba at southern declinations .",
    "the absence of brewster , north liberty , and hancock from the array results in a large hole in a largely east - west ( @xmath8 ) coverage . on the long baseline side of the hole are baselines to the mauna kea and st croix antennas . on the short baseline side of the hole are baselines between the five antennas concentrated in the south west us .",
    "a consequence of the ( @xmath8 ) coverage is that approximately matched resolution images can be made at our four frequencies using a combination of restrictions on the ( @xmath8 ) data and weighting of the visibilities ( described in a sub - section below ) .",
    "this approach reveals useful qualitative information on the structure of the compact radio source .",
    "however , the uncertainties in deconvolution induced by the poor ( @xmath8 ) coverage do not allow quantitative information on the spectral characteristics of the structure .    in order to best determine spectral information",
    ", the long baselines need to be discarded and restrictions on the short baseline ( @xmath8 ) coverage are applied as a function of frequency to provide visibilities matched in spatial frequency ( without the need for additional weighting ) for component fitting in the ( @xmath8 ) plane ( described in a sub - section below ) .    using these two approaches , we determine limited information on the structure and spectra of the compact radio source .      in order to produce the highest angular resolution approximately matched images of the compact structure , we started with the full ( @xmath8 ) coverage at 1.7ghz .",
    "at 2.3ghz , the same ( @xmath8 ) coverage was used but a gaussian taper giving a weight of 0.5 at a ( @xmath8 ) distance of 20 m@xmath9 ( denoted 0.5 , 20 ) was applied to produce an image which approximately matched the resolution obtained at 1.7ghz . at 5.0ghz , no gaussian taper was used , but the long baselines to mauna kea to saint croix were removed , to approximately match the resolution at the two lower frequencies . at 8.4ghz , the data on all baselines to mk and sc were also removed from the dataset and a gaussian taper of 0.5 , 30 was applied to the data , to approximately match the resolution at the other frequencies .",
    "all images were produced using uniform weighting of the data , image sizes of 256 @xmath10 256 pixels , and pixel sizes of 1.0 mas .",
    "standard deconvolution and self - calibration routines were used to form the images . as phase referencing",
    "was not used for these observations , the self - calibration step in imaging ( and indeed via fringe - fitting in aips ) , forces the brightest component in the image at the centre of the image . as seen below",
    ", the brightest component is the same component at all frequencies , thus the alignment of the images at the different frequencies is secure to first order .",
    "small frequency - dependent shifts in the centroid of the brightest component are lost due to self - calibration .",
    "however , a comparison of the overall structure of the source allows a secure identification of the different components of emission across the different frequencies .",
    "these identifications are used to guide the model - fitting process described in the next section .",

    "the analysis above provides information on the structure and spectral properties of pks 2254@xmath0367 . as one of only a small number of gps radio sources within 100mpc , it is important to determine the basic properties of the source and compare them to the other nearby , and more distant , gps sources .",
    "a point of interest is how the nearby gps sources , such as pks 2254@xmath0367 , relate to the so - called compact symmetric objects ( csos ) .",
    "csos are compact ( @xmath111 kpc in projected extent ) and have highly symmetric structures ( wilkinson et al .",
    "1994 ) ; they are thought to be the progenitors of fanaroff - riley type ii radio galaxies ( readhead et al .",
    "snellen et al .  (",

    "we therefore examine pks 2254@xmath0367 to determine how it relates to the classes of objects ( gps , css , cso ) thought to be the precursors of powerful radio galaxies , and in particular other nearby radio sources in these categories .",
    "tingay et al .",

    "bettoni et al .",

    "2000 ; gabel et al .",
    "both radio sources are predominantly compact and have peaked spectra ( de vries , barthel , & odea 1997 ; tingay et al .",
    "all three low redshift gps sources support models in which a dense nuclear environment and merger activity are the cause for the mostly compact radio structure .",
    "pks 2254@xmath0367 and ngc1052 are hosted in cluster dominant ( cd ) elliptical galaxies .    of the three bright components that dominate the pc - scale structure of pks 2254@xmath0367 ,",
    "those labelled a , b , and c in table  1 , a has a marginally peaked spectrum , sits at the centre of the structure , is the brightest component , and is the most compact of the components .",
    "we therefore identify component a as likely to correspond to the nucleus of the radio source , presumably coincident with the supermassive black hole known to reside in the galaxy .",
    "the pc - scale radio source therefore appears to be double - sided , with jet - like extensions comprised of the bright inner component b and the weaker outer component d towards the north - west , and the bright inner component c and the weaker outer component e towards the south - east .",
    "this structure is reflected in both the modelfitting results and the imaging results .",

    "the spectra for the five components are shown in figure  2 .",
    "pks 2254@xmath0367 therefore seems to be a candidate cso , with a symmetric structure centred on component a. in comparison to the cso candidates found in the coins survey ( peck and taylor 2000 ) , pks 2254@xmath0367 seems most similar to the sources j0427@xmath1541 and j1546@xmath1500 .",
    "both these sources appear to have a strong core ( more dominant than in pks 2254@xmath0367 , indicating that these cores may be beamed ) and double sided jets .",

    "we speculate that objects such as ngc1052 and pks 2254@xmath0367 represent a sub - class of gps radio source which are compact , of low luminosity , and jet dominated .",
    "they are differentiated from many other gps sources ( such as pks 1718@xmath0649 ) by the lack of powerful , compact lobes .",

    "objects like pks 1718@xmath0649 may be the higher luminosity analog of fr - ii type radio galaxies .",
    "a possible implication of such a luminosity@xmath0morphology break could be that the origin of the difference between fr - i and fr - ii type radio galaxies lies on the sub - parsec - scale , where the jet is formed close to the black hole and accretion disk .",
    "such schemes are favoured in the theoretical models of meier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who suggest that the fr - i / fr - ii break is due to the magnetic field strength near the black hole .",
    "however , other explanations may exist for the morphology of ngc1052 and pks 2254@xmath0367 .",
    "the nuclear environment is thought to play a major role in the appearance and evolution of gps radio sources , and this seems likely in the case of these two objects . in this case ,",
    "the sub - pc environment of the black hole and accretion disk system would not be of primary relevance .",
    "support for this view can be found in the fact that the properties of the pc - scale jets in fr - i and fr - ii objects , as seen with vlbi , are indistinguishable in terms of morphology and apparent speed , for example as reported by @xcite .",
    "very few sources like pks 2254@xmath0367 or ngc1052 have been studied in detail since even doubling their distance to a modest @xmath23mpc would mean that they lie a factor of four below the 1jy cutoff that is typical of previous radio source surveys .",
    "multi - frequency surveys of weak radio sources would be required to find such objects .",
    "beyond @xmath24mpc only the higher luminosity compact double and gps quasars ( relativistically beamed emission ) could expect to be detected .",

    "the information on ngc1052 and pks 2254@xmath0367 suggest a way forward .",

    "<S> we present the first multi - frequency vlbi images of pks 2254@xmath0367 , a giga - hertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio source hosted by the nearby galaxy ic1459 ( @xmath1=20.5mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> pks 2254@xmath0367 and the radio source in ngc1052 ( pks 0238@xmath0084 ; @xmath1=17.2mpc ) are the two closest gps radio sources to us , far closer than the next closest example , pks 1718@xmath0649 ( @xmath2mpc ) . as such , ic </S>",
    "<S> 1459 and ngc1052 offer opportunities to study the details of the pc - scale radio sources as well as the environments that the radio sources inhabit , across the electromagnetic spectrum . given that some models for the origin and evolution of gps radio sources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and the gaseous nuclear environment , such opportunities for detailed study are important . </S>",
    "<S> our vlbi images of pks 2254@xmath0367 show that the previously identified similarities between ic 1459 and ngc1052 continue onto the pc - scale . </S>",
    "<S> both compact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same luminosity , much lower than typically noted in compact double gps sources . </S>",
    "<S> similarities between pks 2254@xmath0367 and ngc1052 , and differences with respect to other gps galaxies , lead us to speculate that a sub - class of gps radio sources , with low luminosity and with jet - dominated morphologies , exists and would be largely absent from radio source surveys with @xmath31 jy flux density cutoffs . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this possible low - luminosity , jet - dominated population of gps sources could be an analog of the fr - i radio galaxies , with the higher luminosity lobe - dominated gps sources being the analog of the fr - ii radio galaxies .    </S>",
