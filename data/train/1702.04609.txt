    "the aim of this paper is to provide a rigorous morse homological construction of certain local invariants of periodic points of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms via elementary methods .",
    "these invariants are of a subharmonic nature , and in general differ from local floer homology .",
    "their existence was predicted in  @xcite as local contact homology .",
    "however , transversality problems are usually ( but not always ! ) present when trying to define versions of contact homology via standard floer theoretic methods . in full generality",
    "one needs an alternative approach .",
    "one possibility is the polyfold theory due to hofer , wysocki and zehnder , which will provide the analytic background for such constructions .",
    "our goal is to implement a finite - dimensional morse homological approach to local contact homology at the chain level . for invariance properties we rely on the interplay with a parallel construction using singular homology .",
    "in fact , the invariants could even be defined using singular homology instead of morse homology , but then local chain complexes would not be directly related to dynamics , the connection to the sft - like construction from  @xcite would be lost and , most importantly , we would not be able to prove the persistence theorem ( theorem  [ thm_persistence_invariant ] ) . as we know from the geodesic case ,",
    "the persistence theorem is at the heart of applications .",
    "it answers a question raised in  @xcite about precise iteration properties of the local invariants .",
    "a byproduct of our methods is the existence of a symmetric morse - smale pair in any closed manifold with a finite - cyclic action .    in one form or another , transversality issues in sft",
    "are usually related to symmetries .",
    "these difficulties incarnate in many different forms .",
    "for instance , one may try to achieve transversality for floer homology in period @xmath0 using @xmath1-periodic data ( hamltonian and almost complex structure ) .",
    "if this was possible then the floer chain complex , say in the aespherical case with complex coefficients , would inherit an action of @xmath2 by chain maps .",
    "the isotypical components in homology would be invariants of the symplectic manifold , provided transversality for @xmath3-equivariant continuation maps could also be achieved . in this global situation ,",
    "the only non - trivial isotypical component is the trivial one , the resulting invariant is just standard floer homology .",
    "but this construction would still provide interesting dynamical applications .",
    "the most immediate ones come from the fact that floer homology groups would have to generated by good periodic points , in every period",
    ". hence new multiplicity results , which are invisible for standard floer homology , could be proved .",
    "however in local situations , such as ours , other isotypical components may not vanish and do provide new invariants .",
    "this general framework will be exploited in future work , here we are concerned only with the isotypical component corresponding to the trivial action since this is the appropriate substitute of local contact homology",
    ".    there may be other approaches to our invariants .",
    "for instance by applying the borel construction , similarly to  @xcite and  @xcite , in order to build a @xmath3-equivariant version of local floer homology . here",
    "@xmath3 acts by time - reparametrization of loops @xmath4 .",
    "time - symmetry at the chain level is lost in this approach as one perturbs the data to achieve transversality , not to mention further limits in finite - dimensional approximations of @xmath5 , making it impossible to work with the symmetry in the chain complex .",
    "the approach of  @xcite is geometrically transparent but suffers from usual transversality problems .",
    "symmetry in the chain complex is also lost in the interesting approach outlined by hutchings  @xcite .    in order to work on the chain level we study transversality for finite - dimensional local morse homology at an isolated critical point in the case that both function and critical point are invariant by an ambient @xmath3-action .",
    "we show ( theorem  [ main1 ] ) that we can @xmath6-perturb to achieve transversality keeping @xmath3-symmetry , allowing the group to act at the chain level .",
    "we apply this result to approach local contact homology via discrete action functionals as in  @xcite .",
    "we also look at a finite - dimensional approach to local floer homology , taking the path of mazzucchelli  @xcite in order to study _ symplectically degenerate maxima _ ( sdm ) originally defined in  @xcite . using our non - symmetric persistence theorem  [ thm_persistence_non_invariant ] , analogous to the main result of  @xcite , we simplify the definition of sdm s from  @xcite in the discretized set - up .",
    "then , using chas - sullivan type products , which play the role of local pair - of - pants products , we characterize sdm s in terms of idempotency ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.3 ) .",
    "finally , we remark that our local invariants serve as tools to study bifurcation theory of isolated critical points in the presence of finite cyclic symmetry groups . at the end of this introduction in section  [ sssec_bifurcation_pics ] we provide explicit examples in dimension two for certain generic bifurcations studied by deng and xia  @xcite",
    ": we study cases when two , four and eight critical points bifurcate from the singularity .",
    "+ _ organization of the paper .",
    "_ in the remaining of the introduction we state and discuss our main results , constructions , and examples .",

    "section  [ sec_shifting_lemma ] is devoted to persistence theorems ( shifting lemmas ) , both symmetric and non - symmetric versions .",
    "local chas - sullivan products are defined in section  [ sec_chas_sullivan ] . sections  [ sec_prelim_transv ] ,  [ sec : ms_local ] and  [ sec : ms_global ] deal with transversality .",
