    "such halos are relatively rare .",
    "they are generated by a population of ultra - relativistic electrons ( coexisting with thermal electrons of the icm ) that emit synchrotron radiation in the cluster magnetic field .",
    "such electrons should be relatively short - lived ( @xmath1 yr ) due to inverse compton and synchrotron energy losses ( see sarazin 1999 for detailed modeling ) , and yet they must have time to spread over the cluster volume or they should be accelerated in situ .",
    "the source of such electrons that can support a halo for a sufficient time is unclear .",
    "several possibilities were proposed , including radio galaxies ( jaffe 1977 ) , interaction of cosmic ray protons with the icm protons ( dolag & enlin 2000 and references therein ) , and the turbulence generated by merger shocks ( harris , kapahi , & ekers 1980 ; tribble 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , merger shocks dissipate vast amounts of kinetic energy that , besides heating the intracluster gas , may power the amplification of magnetic fields and acceleration ( or re - acceleration ) of relativistic particles .",
    "a correlation between the existence of a radio halo and the irregular cluster shape ( that usually indicates a merger ) has been noticed ( e.g. , feretti 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "further , buote ( 2001 ) showed that for clusters with known radio halos , the radio power correlates with the degree of the x - ray morphological disturbance .",
    "such correlations favor the merger origin of halos . on the other hand , there are a few highly disturbed clusters without halos ( buote 2001 ) and , as pointed out by liang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , halos in relaxed clusters may have escaped detection , because such clusters usually have strong central radio sources making observation of a low surface brightness halo technically difficult . a correlation between the radio halo power and the cluster gas temperature",

    "examination of the pspc image in the relevant 0.71.3 kev band shows no spatial variations of the soft background in the vicinity of a2163 to within 5% .",
    "therefore , we can model this excess by fitting its spectrum from chip s2 and then adding the best - fit model , scaled by the region area , to the model of the cluster emission ( thus a small difference in vignetting between the cluster position and the field covered by s2 will be taken into account properly ) . after the subtraction of the nominal blank - field background , the s2 excess spectrum in the 0.53 kev band is described quite well by a simple absorbed thermal model ( mekal , kaastra 1992 ) with @xmath9 kev , @xmath10 , a metal abundance unconstrained but consistent with solar , and the absorption column consistent with the  pspc value derived by elbaz et al .",

    "on the other hand , if the observed excess is due to the temporary increase of the particle background , it would not be vignetted in the same way as are x - rays from the sky .",

    "when deriving the a2163 temperature profile (  [ sec : tprof ] ) , we tried to minimize the influence of the soft background excess by discarding the data with @xmath14 kev where the excess is greater than 50% of the nominal background ( fig .",

    "would further limit the background uncertainty but also decrease the statistical accuracy of the results .    the acis readout artifact , although not particularly important in the absence of sharp brightness peaks in these clusters , was subtracted as an additional background component .",
    "it was modeled under the assumption of no pile - up by randomizing the chipy coordinate of the events , recalculating the pi values for the new coordinate , and normalizing the resulting images or spectra by the ratio of the readout exposure ( 41 ms ) to the useful frame exposure ( 3.2 s ) .      to fit a spectrum in a large region , a telescope response file ( arf ) was calculated by weighting the mirror effective area within the region with the observed cluster brightness distribution in the 0.52 kev band , taken as a representation of the cluster projected emission measure ( the changes in vignetting within each region are negligible in this energy band ) .",

    "[ 2163map ] ( grayscale ) is overlaid on the _ vla _ 1.4 ghz contours showing the central region of the radio halo ( from m. birkinshaw & t. herbig , in preparation ) .",
    "contours are log - spaced by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "the angular resolution of the image is 45 .",
    "crosses ( from feretti et al .",
    "2001 ) show positions of unrelated radio point sources in the central region .",
    "[ 2163radio ]  in a2163 ( fig .",
    "[ 2163radio ] ) , there is also an apparent correlation between the gas temperature and the radio brightness  the main elongation of the halo s brightest part coincides with the hottest region of the cluster ( the southeastern radio elongation is probably due to a point source ) .",
    "however , the hottest region itself coincides with an enhancement of the x - ray brightness ( fig .",
    "[ 2163map]_b _ ) .",
    "feretti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report that on larger scales and at lower radio brightness levels , the radio emission largely follows the x - ray emission .",
    "so for a2163 , there is an ambiguity of whether the x - ray brightness or the gas temperature underlies the radio morphology .",
    "a similar observation of the large - scale similarity of the x - ray and radio brightness was made for several other clusters with well - studied halos ( e.g. , deiss et al .",
    "1997 ; liang et al .",
    "2000 ; govoni et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "however , for a665 with a more transparent merger geometry , it is clear that it is not simply the x - ray brightness , or the projected gas density , that determines the synchrotron brightness .",
    "figure  [ 665radio]_b _ shows the radio image divided by the square root of the x - ray brightness ( to do this , we smoothed the x - ray image to the resolution of the radio image ) . a square root of an x - ray image crudely represents the projected distribution of the number density of thermal electrons .",
    "therefore , such a ratio has an approximate physical meaning of the synchrotron brightness ( or the number of relativistic electrons if the magnetic field is reasonably uniform ) per thermal electron on the line of sight . as seen in fig .",
    "[ 665radio]_b _ , this quantity peaks at the position of the shock .",
    "if the seed particles for acceleration are distributed more or less uniformly in the cluster thermal gas ( as they are expected to be , for example , if the seeds come from the icm pool as proposed by liang et al .",
    "2000 ) , then the image of this ratio in a665 indicates that the particle acceleration indeed occurs at the shock site .",
    "several sources of the moderately high - energy or relativistic seeds for acceleration to the ultra - relativistic energies were proposed ( see , e.g. , enlin 2000 for a review ) . besides the radio galaxies ( jaffe 1977 ) and the high - energy tail of the icm electrons ( liang et al .",
    "2000 ) , they may include particles heated by mild turbulence induced by galaxy motions ( e.g. , deiss et al .",
    "1997 ) or past mergers ( e.g. , sarazin 2000 ) . a discussion of these sources and the precise mechanism of acceleration is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our results appear to indicate that in a665 and possibly in a2163 , the final acceleration of the seed electrons to ultra - relativistic energies occurs inside the shock - heated gas .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that a merging cluster has to be in a favorable projection for a clear view of the shocks ( as in a665 ) , so one expects that in many clusters seen at less favorable angles , the temperature features and their association with the radio brightness would be less apparent .",
    "the population of the relativistic electrons producing synchrotron radio halos should also scatter cosmic microwave background photons to x - ray energies via the inverse compton ( ic ) mechanism .",
    "a tentative detection of the hard ic emission was reported for some clusters ( fusco - femiano et al.1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "one may ask whether the above correlation between the temperature maps ( which are , essentially , the x - ray hardness ratio maps ) and the radio emission could be trivially explained by an ic contribution .",
    "the spectral index of the x - ray ic emission should be the same as the radio synchrotron index .",
    "radio spectra of halos are steep ; from the jones & saunders ( 1996 ) measurements at 1.4  ghz and 151  mhz , the energy index of the a665 halo is @xmath53 ( this is slightly less steep than a typical slope ; they also present a higher frequency point where the spectrum steepens , but the lower frequencies are more relevant for the ic estimate ) .",
    "the expected ic spectrum ( @xmath54 ) is much softer than the additional spectral component needed in our energy band to mimic the hot spot in a665 ( @xmath55 , which would require an unphysical power spectrum of the relativistic electrons ) .",
    "thus the hot spot in a665 and , similarly , the hot regions in a2163 , can not be due to the ic contribution .",
    "it is interesting to try and place a more accurate limit on the possible ic flux in the a665 hot spot region , since it is the place where the ratio of the radio to x - ray emission is highest .",
    "we can estimate the expected ic flux ( as in , e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) using the estimates of the equipartition magnetic field and spectral index from jones & saunders ( 1996 ) and a 1.4  ghz flux from the giovannini & feretti ( 2000 ) radio map .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can not exclude such a power - law component at a level up to two orders of magnitude above the expected flux .",
    "thus , we can not place interesting constraints on the ic contribution .",
    "using  data , we have derived gas temperature maps for the a665 and a2163 clusters . both show strong temperature variations indicating ongoing mergers . in a665 , we discover a bow shock in front of the cluster core indicating that the core is moving with a relatively high mach number . in a2163 ,",
    "the temperature map is too complicated to allow unambiguous interpretation .",
    "for the first time , we compare cluster temperature maps with radio halo images and show that the hottest regions correlate with the brightest regions of the radio halos .",
    "this indicates that acceleration of the relativistic electrons that generate the radio halos occurs at the sites of shock heating .",
    "we are grateful to leon vanspeybroeck for allowing us to analyze his guaranteed time observations of a665 and a2163 , and to mark birkinshaw for providing us the a2163 radio image prior to publication .",
