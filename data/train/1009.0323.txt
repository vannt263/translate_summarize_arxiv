    ", the energy gap vanishes as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "thus the dynamics becomes non - adiabatic around a region near this point and the system fails to remain at the instantaneous ground state leading to formation of defects @xcite . the density of these defects ( @xmath0 ) and the residual energy produced in the process ( @xmath1 ) scale with universal exponents : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath4 is the system dimension @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that scaling laws do not change if the dynamics terminate at the critical point @xcite .",
    "all of the above - mentioned studies apply to isotropic critical points where the scaling of the energy gap with the momentum is described by a single exponent @xmath27 .",
    "recently , the anisotropic dirac model with an anisotropic critical point is studied and it was shown that one needs multiple exponents to describe the scaling of the energy gap @xcite . however such studies have not been carried out in the context of the kitaev model and generic expressions for the scaling laws for @xmath0 and @xmath1 for such critical points in arbitrary dimensions have not been provided .",
    "also , the effect of disorder on defect production in models , where the harris criterion allows for the existence of a sharp quantum phase transition , has not been studied so far@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study several aspects of non - equilibrium slow dynamics in the vicinity of both anisotropic critical points and critical points in the presence of disorder with specific focus on the 2d kitaev model which provides an explicit realization of both the cases .",
    "first , we derive a generic model - independent expression for the scaling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for such dynamics which takes a @xmath4-dimensional system from a gapped phase to the vicinity of an anisotropic critical point .",

    "we also show , by exact analytical solution for linear time evolution ( @xmath38 ) , that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kitaev model , in the absence of disorder , provides an explicit realization of the scaling laws mentioned above with @xmath14 and @xmath39 leading to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we also corroborate the scaling laws mentioned above by numerical studies of the kitaev model for arbitrary power - law time evolution .",
    "second , we compute all independent multispin correlation function of the kitaev model subsequent to a slow linear ramp which takes the system from a gapped phase to the vicinity of the anisotropic critical point , demonstrate their anisotropic nature , and discuss their spatial dependence .",
    "third , we study non - equilibrium slow linear dynamics of the disordered kitaev model where disorder is introduced via random choice of the fields @xmath42 in the fermionic representation of the model , and show , by explicit numerical calculation , that the defect production for such a dynamics obeys a different scaling law compared to its disorder free counterpart : @xmath18 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for a quench ending in the gapless ( gapped ) phase .",
    "we provide a qualitative explanation for such defect production .",
    "the organization of the rest of the work is as follows . in sec.[anis1 ] , we discuss scaling laws for defect density and residual energy for dynamics near an anisotropic critical point in the absence of disorder and show that the 2d kitaev model constitutes an example of such a critical point .",
