    "strongly coupled matter - light systems , such as exciton - polariton microcavities , have recently witnessed an escalating interest thanks to the simultaneous versatility in manipulating and probing their intrinsic properties . resulting from the strong coupling of cavity photons and quantum well excitons , exciton - polaritons display unique properties deriving from both their constituents",
    " for recent reviews see refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the resonant excitation scheme , where polaritons are directly injected by an external laser near the energy of the lower polariton dispersion , allows to experimentally access a unique accurate tuning of the system parameters , such as the polariton density , current properties , as well as their phase , which is locked to the one of the external pump .    much work has been already done both theoretically as well as experimentally for resonantly pumped single component polariton fluids in the pump - only configuration  @xcite , i.e. , where only the pump state is occupied and no parametric scattering occurs .",
    "particular interest was dedicated in analysing the properties of the collective spectrum of excitations and relate them to the system superfluid behaviour  @xcite . here , the spectrum could be classified either as gapped , or linear , or else diffusive - like , in terms of a single parameter , the renormalised pump detuning .",
    "interestingly , diffusive - like spectra in non - equilibrium fluids have been shown to be related to parametric scattering and amplification  @xcite and to the occurrence of a negative drag force of the single component polariton fluid when scattering against a localised defect  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider the case of a spinor , i.e. , two - component , polariton fluid , by explicitly including the polarisation degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been observed that , for fixed pump detuning and degree of polarisation , the system undergoes a spin flip and a subsequent hysteresis curve when varying the pump power , promoting this system as an ideal environment where to realise an optical spin switch@xcite or a logical gate@xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been recently demonstrated that spinor polariton systems have tunable cross - spin interaction properties  @xcite .    in previous recent work  @xcite",
    ", the spectrum of elementary excitation for a resonantly excited pump - only polariton fluid including the spin degrees of freedom was analysed . in that work , by considering for simplicity only the limiting cases of a purely linearly polarised fluid and a purely circularly polarised one , the focus was on the superfluid properties of the system and the possiblity of reproducing a linear spectrum when the pump detuning compensates exactly the interaction - induced blueshift .    here",
    ", we propose a pump - probe set - up tailored for analysing the properties of the collective excitation spectrum .",
    "we show that in the linear response approximation scheme , valid for a weak probe beam , the spectrum of excitations can be evaluated analytically even in the generic case of an elliptically polarised spinor polariton fluid .",
    "further , for fixed interaction strengths , the spectrum can be completely classified in terms of only two experimentally tunable parameters : the mean - field polarisation angle and a rescaled pump detuning . now",
    "the number of different class sets of spectra is much larger compared with the single fluid case . yet , depending how the two opposite circular polarisation degrees of freedom mix together in the spectra , we can single out three larger sets where the behaviour of the spectrum intrinsic degree of polarisation is qualitatively different .",
    "we name them as _ gapped _ , @xmath0-_diffusive _ , and @xmath1-_diffusive _ ; these regions in the two - parameter space",
    "are separated by conditions for which the spectrum can be _",
    "linear_. while for gapped spectra , there is no mixing of opposite circular polarisation degrees of freedom , for both diffusive - like spectra , the mixing is responsible for flips of the intrinsic spin degree of polarisation along the branches .",
    "further , we evaluate the system response to the external probe and analyse the properties of the transmitted light and its relations to the collective excitation spectrum .",
    "in particular we determine the properties of the spin flip along the branches for diffusive - like spectra and how the spin rotation is larger , the closer the system is to a parametric instability .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present the generalised gross - pitaevskii equation that describes the resonantly pumped spinor fluid and briefly discuss its mean - field solutions from existing literature . we introduce the proposed pump - probe scheme in sec .",

    "in contrast , all linear polarisation states ( parallel to the cavity mirror ) lie on the equator and for those one can choose two alternative basis , either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "a generic elliptically polarised state @xmath4 lies everywhere on the sphere , except at the poles and at the equator , and is defined by a polar angle @xmath5 ( characterising the degree of mixing between circular and linear polarisation ) and an azimuthal angle @xmath6 ( characterising the in - plane polarisation orientation with respect to an @xmath7-linearly - polarised state).,width=307 ]",
    "the dynamics of resonantly pumped polaritons is described by a gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the polariton field generalised to include the effects of the polariton finite lifetime @xmath8 , as well as the ones of an external laser that resonantly injects polaritons into the microcavity  @xcite . here , we consider a simplified model which involves the lower polariton ( lp ) branch only .",
    "the resonant pumping scheme we will consider implies populating a specific lp state with low momentum , allowing us to neglect the occupation of the upper polariton branch .",

    "we can thus substitute @xmath22 .",
    "polariton interaction properties depend on their polarisation component .",
    "with @xmath23 we denote the interaction strength between polaritons in the same circular polarisation state ; this is repulsive , @xmath24 , like the interaction strength between excitons with the same spin  @xcite ; when excitons mix with photons to form polaritons , one can show that the resulting strength @xmath23 weakly depends on the lp properties such as the photon - exciton detuning and the rabi splitting  @xcite .",
    "instead @xmath25 is the interaction strength between polaritons with opposite circular polarisations .",
    "interestingly , it has been very recently shown that this inter - polarisation coupling can be tuned by means of a bipolariton feshbach resonance mechanism  @xcite from being attractive to repulsive , by simply changing the value of the lp photon - exciton detuning . here , we assume to be far from such a resonance , in a regime where @xmath25 is weakly attractive , and in particular we fix @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "note that , for an equilibrium homogeneous spinor bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature ( i.e. , described by the same gpe with no pumping nor decaying term and chemical potentials fixing the particle number in each condensate ) , attraction between opposite components implies a collapse of the system , i.e. , mechanical instability , unless @xmath27  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the results obtained here for the polariton spinor fluid resonantly pumped by an external laser do not qualitatively depend on the particular value chosen for the ratio @xmath28 . interestingly , the anisotropy of polariton - polariton interactions , characterised by the ratio @xmath29 , was shown to be responsible for the existence of effective magnetic monopoles in the form of half - integer topological defects@xcite and screening of a magnetic field , the _",

    "note that in this resonant pumping scheme , the polariton fluid phase is locked to the one of the external laser .",
    "one can then find how the intensity of the emission in the two polarisation states , @xmath31 , vary when changing the system parameters , e.g. , by increasing the pump strength and its degree of polarisation , via the parameters @xmath32 .",
    "much work has been recently carried out to investigate the mean - field properties of spinor polariton fluids , including the possibility for multistable behaviour  see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , for a single - component resonantly pumped polariton fluid , multistability appears when the polariton population goes through an hysteresis loop as a function of the pump intensity : when resonantly pumping above the lp dispersion , an increase of the pump power implies an interaction induced blue - shift of the lp energy towards resonance and thus a sudden increase of the lp population .",
    "when instead the pump power is lowered , a sudden drop occurs at lower pump powers , resulting in a region on multistability .",
    "for spinor fluids , it has been found that the most - populated spin component is subject to an hysteresis loop , while the less - populated component undergoes a smooth intensity increase  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this mechanism has been proposed for realising an optical spin switch  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature for the mean - field analysis , and instead assume here that the system is pumped in such a way as to induce a given degree of polarisation for the mean - field solution .",
    "this is completely characterised , as any general elliptical polarisation state , by both a polar angle @xmath33 and an azimuthal angle @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poinc ] ) , respectively defined as : @xmath35 without loss of generality , we can however assume that the pump induces a mean - field state with @xmath36 , as this simply corresponds to a choice of the reference coordinate system and any other elliptically polarised state can be obtained by rotating the microcavity plane .",
    "we then study how the collective excitation spectrum for such spinor polariton fluid , as well as its response to a weak - probe beam , change when varying @xmath37 $ ]  the other interval @xmath38 $ ] is symmetric for @xmath39 .     with embedded quantum wells [ qws ] )",

    "a second weak probe beam , with momentum @xmath40 , and energy @xmath41 that can be scanned at different values , is used to probe the system collective excitation spectrum .",
    "the transmitted light will have a `` particle - like '' component emitting at the direction corresponding to @xmath40 and a `` hole - like '' component at @xmath42.,width=307 ]",
    "in order to probe the spectrum of collective excitations of a resonantly pumped spinor polariton fluid , we introduce an additional weak beam which can be shined at several energies and angles , different from the pump ones .",
    "in particular , referring to the schematic setup for the proposed pump - probe experiment in fig .  [",

    "we first note that , as expected , the probe beam   has only a finite strength in the particle - like channels and can not directly excite hole - like quasi - particles . nevertheless , the response has a finite emission intensity also for the hole - like branches because of the interactions mixing together particle and hole degrees of freedom . as previously illustrated in eq .",
    "particle and hole modes asymptotically decouple one from the other at large momenta .",
    "we thus expect that the response emission intensity quickly drops to zero for all hole - like branches . in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_gap ] this behaviour is clearly visible , as the emission intensity of the hole branches is strongly reduced with respect to the one of the particle branches .    in the previous section",
    "we have seen that each branch of the collective excitation spectrum is characterised by an intrinsic degrees of polarization , quantified by the normal ( @xmath232 ) and anti - normal ( @xmath233 ) polar angles . in fig .",

    "[ fig : eigen ] ) , in this particular case almost purely circularly left or right polarized .",
    "hence , one expects that the emission intensity for the @xmath150 and @xmath152 branches is comparable , since the linearly polarised probe couples identically to left- and right - polarized modes . in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_gap ] we observe the polarization to undergo a rotation when in resonance with one of the spectral branches . as expected , probing at resonance with the @xmath150 branch results in a largely left - polarized emission , while the @xmath152 branch induces a right - circular polarization .",
    "interesting effects are observed for the case of diffusive spectra , and we show in particular the case of a @xmath0-_diffusive _ spectrum in fig .  [",
    "fig : probe_dif ] . for this case",
    "we consider the case of a right - circularly polarized probe beam ( @xmath206 ) so that we have a @xmath107 branch emitting much stronger than the @xmath105 branch ( see panel ( a ) of  fig .",

    "however , around @xmath101 , where the spectral branches mixed one the other in a diffusive region , we see that the resonant branch is not @xmath107 , rather @xmath106 . here , the strongest emission intensity comes from the @xmath107 branch at large momenta and from the @xmath151 branch inside the diffusive region at small @xmath68 . because of the mixing between @xmath133 and @xmath136 degrees of freedom ,",
    "we have observed a sudden spin flip for the degree of polarisation of the eigenvectors around @xmath234 .",
    "this is the reason for the resonant emission transfers from @xmath107 to @xmath106 at small @xmath68 . from panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_dif ] it is clear that , in the beam transferred in the @xmath200 direction , the emission is the strongest in the diffusive momentum ring at @xmath235 where @xmath152 and @xmath236 are mixed . the stronger intensity for these modes can be explained in terms of an onset of parametric amplification .",
    "in fact , in this diffusive region the imaginary part of the spectrum part deviates from the value of the constant decay rate and there is an additional contribution from the negative argument of the outer root in eq .",
    " see panel 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] . for this reason ,",
    "these modes acquire a longer lifetime , and therefore undergo enhanced scattering .",
    "similarly , in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_dif ] , one can appreciate an increase in transmission in the same diffusive region .",
    "in addition , there is also an increased emission on the diffusive region at @xmath235 where the @xmath152 and @xmath153 branches are degenerate .",
    "although , for these values of the momentum , these branches are circularly left polarized , the inter - spin interaction coupling the @xmath133 and @xmath136 modes , combined with the strong parametric amplification , still leads to a strong emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that in previous work  @xcite , the proximity to an instability to a parametric scattering regime has been related to the occurrence of a negative drag force when a resonantly pumped polariton fluid scatters against a localised defect . here",
    ", the same phenomenon leads to enhanced emission of parametrically amplified modes when the system is probed with an additional weak laser .    in panels ( c ) [ ( d ) ] of fig",
    "[ fig : probe_dif ] we plot the azimuthal polarization angle for particle - like ( hole - like)transmitted signal at @xmath48 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the resonant branch is @xmath152 at large @xmath68 and @xmath151 for small values of the momentum and strongly emits circularly right polarized light  @xmath237 .",
    "yet the parametrically amplified region around @xmath101 emits both in the transmitted @xmath48 and @xmath200 directions an almost purely circularly left polarized light .",
    "hence , the parametric amplification of the mixed @xmath152 and @xmath153 mode causes the left - polarized incoming probe light to undergo a spin flip when interacting with the polariton sample .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] that @xmath238 tend to @xmath0 ( i.e. , almost pure left - polarization ) , when the parametric amplified mode @xmath239 , probed with @xmath209 , is brought closer to resonance by varying the polariton decay time @xmath240  here @xmath241 is the minimum value of the polariton decay rate required for the system stability , i.e. , @xmath242 .",
    "the emission intensity ( panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] ) diverges as @xmath243 for both particle - like and hole - like signals when they are brought close to resonance .",
    "this can be understood from the expression  , where we see that the right - hand side becomes singular if @xmath202 equals @xmath244 and at the same time @xmath245 . in this limit ,",
    "the response @xmath67 coincides with the eigenvector @xmath246 of the bogoliubov matrix @xmath217 . here , this is the case for @xmath247 , so that the polarization @xmath220 of the response approaches @xmath248 , as it can be seen in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "note that @xmath249 exactly in the diffusive disk around @xmath146 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 coincide . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , we have measured the decay rate @xmath218 in units of self - interaction energy @xmath128 .    experimentally , however , @xmath218 is fixed for a given microcavity , but the ratio @xmath250 can be tuned by varying the laser pump power , @xmath251 in eq .  .",
    "one should then calculate the mean - field equations   to derive the polariton spin densities @xmath252 and thus the self - interaction energy @xmath128 . by varying the tilting angle of the probe beam with respect to the pump , one can scan through @xmath68-space . as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] , also the detectors should be placed accordingly : one at the same angle as the probe and the other at the mirrored angle , to detect the particle and the hole - like signal respectively . at each position of the probe , a vertical slice on the response figures can be reconstructed by changing the probe frequency @xmath202 and measuring the intensity and polarization at both detectors .",
    "we have analytically derived the spectrum of elementary excitations for a spinor polariton fluid in the linear response approximation scheme . for fixed interaction stength",
    ", the spectra can be classified in terms of two dimensionless parameters only : mean - field polarization angle and the renormalised pump detuning .",
    "even though there is a large variety of possible spectra , we identify three major classes , _ gapped _ , @xmath0-_diffusive _ , and @xmath1-_diffusive _ , depending how the opposite polarisation spectral branches mix together and at which energy .",
    "for @xmath0-_diffusive _ the mixing happens at zero energies , for @xmath1-_diffusive _ it happens at finite energy .",
    "interestingly , only the mean - field polarization is sufficient to distinguish between these two different diffusive - like spectra .",
    "we show that the mixing of @xmath133 and @xmath136 branches characterises sudden spin flips of the intristic degree of polarisation along the branches for both diffusive - like spectra .",
    "we have characterised the response of the system to an external probe in terms of the spectral intrinsic properties . in particular",
    ", we have shown that the intrinsic polarization of an elementary excitation is reflected in the trasmitted signal of a probe beam experiment . for _ gapped _ spectra the degree of polarisation varies only very weakly along each branches .",
    "in contrast , for both @xmath0-_diffusive _ and @xmath1-_diffusive _ spectra , the strong mixing between opposite polarisation branches at small momenta leads to a spin flip of the transmitted degree of polarisation along the branch .",
    "the closer the polariton spinor fluid is to a parametric instability , the larger the amount of spin flip is , independently of the degree of polarisation of the probing beam .    recently",
    "numerous fascinating results have been achieved in the study of the response of a spinor polariton fluid to a magnetic field , such as the spin meissner effect@xcite and effective magnetic monopoles@xcite . as a future perspective",
    ", it could be interesting to include the zeeman - splitting terms in our model and study their influence on the spectrum of excitations .",
