    "the next challenge in the field is the development of _ quantum microwave photonics _ in the gigahertz regime .",
    "the scope is the generation , control and measurement of propagating photons , contemplating all its possibilities as carriers of quantum information and mediators of long distance correlations .",
    "the natural framework is that of active and passive _ quantum metamaterials _",
    ", with open transmission lines to support propagation of photons and embedded circuits to control them @xcite .",
    "qubits can be a possible ingredient in these metamaterials .",
    "a two - level system may act as a saturable mirror for resonant photons  @xcite , as it has been demonstrated in a breakthrough experiment with flux qubits  @xcite , continued by further demonstrations of single photon transistors  @xcite , and electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite .",
    "these groundbreaking developments , together with theoretical studies of band engineering using qubits  @xcite and josephson junction arrays  @xcite , and recent developments in the field of photodetection  @xcite , provide solid foundations for this rapidly growing field .",
    "it is important to contrast these developments with alternative setups in the high - energy microwave regime ( terahertz )  @xcite , which differ both in the architecture and the scope .    in this work",
    ", we advocate an alternative architecture for both passive and active quantum metamaterials based on transmission lines with embedded josephson junctions ( jj ) . adopting a bottom - up approach",
    ", we first study the scattering of travelling photons through a single junction , the simplest and most fundamental element in superconducting technologies .",
    "it is shown that , in the few photon limit , the linearized junction acts as a perfect mirror for resonant photon . starting from the single jj scattering matrix ,",
    "we show how to engineer metamaterials using periodic arrangements of junctions both in one and two - dimensional transmission line networks .",
    "compared to previous approaches , this combines the travelling nature and flexible geometry of photons in transmission lines  @xcite , and instead of qubits  @xcite it relies on the simple and robust dynamics of a linearized junction  @xcite .",
    "previous proposals lacked one of these two ingredients .",
    "the simplicity of this setup opens the door to multiple short - term applications . in this manuscript",
    "we discuss mainly two .",
    "the first one is the observation of a negative index of refraction in a two - dimensional circuit crystal .",
    "this would be achieved by injecting an appropriate microwave in a square network of transmission lines , where only half of it is populated with embedded junctions .",
    "second and most important , we study the interaction between qubits in a disordered quantum metamaterial , showing that a sufficiently large disorder can support the generation of entanglement between two distant flux qubits .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that different topics in the fields of metamaterials and localization , usually discussed in the classical or _",
    "photon level can be realized in the few photon limit inside the field of circuit qed .",

    "[ sec : qme ] we study the coupling between qubits and those structured lines .",
    "we develop an analytical theory that models the interaction and dissipation of superconducting qubits in a network of jj and transmission lies , within the master equation formalism . this theory",
    "is then applied to the study of the steady entanglement between two separated qubits that interact with a structured line where it has been induced disorder .",
    "we finish with the conclusions , while some technical aspects are elaborated in the appendices .",
    "jjs are the most versatile nonlinear element in circuit qed . either alone , or in connection with extra capacitors or junctions , they form all types of superconducting qubits to date  @xcite . moreover , in recent years they have also been used inside cavities to shape and control confined photons , dynamically tuning the mode structure  @xcite , enhancing the light - matter coupling  @xcite , or exploiting their nonlinearity in resonators  @xcite .",
    "junctions have also been sugested as control elements for propagating photons in two different ways .",
    "one approach consist of squids or charge qubit arrays to control the photon dispersion relation forming one dimensional _ quantum metamaterials _",
    "the other alternative relies on the single photon scattering by superconducting qubits  @xcite , using the fact that two level systems act as perfect mirror whenever the incident photon frequency and the qubit splitting equals .    in the following we combine these ideas , providing both a uniform theoretical framework to study the interaction of josephson junctions with propagating photons and a scalable architecture to construct _ quantum metamaterials _ by periodic arrangements of these junctions . just like in the case of qubits",
    ", we expect that a jj in an open line may act as a perfect scatterer of propagating photons , where now the resonant frequency is given by the jj plasma frequency .",

    "these and other setups @xcite can be seen as a generalization of photonic crystals to the quantum microwave regime , with similar capabilities for controlling the propagation of photons : engineered dispersion relations , gaps of forbidden frequencies , localized modes , adjustable group velocities @xcite and index of refraction , and control of the emission and absorption of embedded artificial atoms ( i.e. improved cavities )  @xcite .    in the following , we will use the linearized scattering theory discussed so far . regarding possible nonlinear corrections ,",
    "we expand the cosine term in ( [ tl - jj ] ) , @xmath42 , containing both the linear contribution and the first nonlinear correction . since we are working in the single - photon regime",
    ", we can replace @xmath43 by its fluctuations on the vacuum which are proportional to the discontinuity of the wavefunction on that point @xmath44 .",
    "all together implies a correction of @xmath45 compared to the linear contribution .",
    "if we simply view these nonlinear corrections as an inductance dispersion we conclude that we can safely neglect them , since as we will show in section [ sec : ed ] such a dispersion hardly affects the transport properties .",
    "the simplest possible instance of a quantum circuit crystal consists of a unit cell with @xmath46 junctions that repeat periodically in a one dimensional line .",
    "the lagrangian is a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ tl - jj ] ) , combining the junctions together with the intermediate line fields . in the 1d case",
    "there are no additional constraints on the flux and at equilibrium @xmath47 minimizes the energy [ see below eq .",

    "the scattering problem is translationally invariant and its eigensolutions are determined by the transfer matrix of the unit cell , @xmath48 which relates the field at both sides , @xmath49 through @xmath50 for a setup with junctions and free lines , the transfer matrix has the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the transfer matrix of the @xmath53-th junction and @xmath54 is the free propagator through a distance @xmath55 @xcite @xmath56 the stationary states are given by bloch waves , which are eigenstates of the displacement operator between equivalent sites . since this operator is unitary , the eigenvalue can only be a phase , @xmath57 , which we associate with the quasimomentum @xmath58 with @xmath59 the intercell distance",

    "notice in ( d ) that in the lower band the gray and blue line are indistinguishable . ]",
    "these one dimensional microwave photonic crystals have a variety of applications  @xcite .",
    "the first one is the suppression of spontaneous emission from qubits , which is achieved by tuning their frequency to lay exactly in the middle of a band gap .",
    "another application is the dynamical control of group velocities .",
    "while the width of the band gaps is more directly related to the values of @xmath63 and the separation among scatterers , their position depends on the scatterer frequency , @xmath40 . replacing the jjs with squids  @xcite , it becomes possible to dynamically tune the slopes of the energy bands , changing from large group velocities ( large slope ) to almost flat bands ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bands]d ) where photons may be effectively frozen @xcite .",
    "flat bands may themselves be used to create quantum memories and also to induce a tight - binding model on the photons , in the spirit of coupled - cavity systems  @xcite .",
    "a third application is the engineering of dissipation where photonic crystals provide a new arena for theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "we will focus on this point in the last section , studying the relation between disorder , localization and entanglement generation in 1d _ quantum circuit crystals_.      the evolution from one dimensional arrangements to two - dimensional or quasi-2d circuit crystals demands a careful analysis .",
    "the reason for this extra complication is that , unlike in 1d or tree configurations , phase quantization along closed paths introduces new contraints that prevent us from gauging away the _",
    "phases @xmath75 and fluxes @xmath76 in absence on travelling photons .",
    "more precisely , for any closed path @xmath77 on the lattice we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the phase differences along each branch and @xmath80 is the sum of external and induced fluxes enclosed by @xmath81 . the presence of these fluxes may forbid an equilibrium condition with all phases equal to zero .",
    "the physics of our two - dimensional crystals is intimately related to that of 2d josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) , a system whose equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties have been thoroughly studied in the last twenty years @xcite . in particular",
    ", we know that jjas constitute a physical realizations or the classical frustrated xy model , where frustration is similarly induced by the fluxes threaded through the 2d plaquettes .    a proper study of the photonic excitations must therefore begin by studying the _ static _ state on top of which they will propagate .",
    "for that we may rely on the classical nonlinear expression for the circuit s energy , built from capacitive and inductive terms , where the latter contain both the junctions and the ( adimensional ) mutual inductance matrix , @xmath82 @xcite @xmath83.\\ ] ] the optimization of this problem is a formidable task : minimization of ( [ effhxy ] ) subjected at ( [ fqxy ] ) when the induced flux are related to the current ( phases ) through the inductance matrix .",
    "in fact , there is no known solution if any dc field is applied . however , let us focus on a setup without external fields , then @xmath84 .",
    "this is stable against small perturbations and against the quantum fluctuations induced both by the capacitive terms and the travelling photons because the phases are linear in the applied field at small fields @xcite and they enter on second order in the scattering equations [ cf . eq .",
    "( [ scjjlf ] ) ] .",
    "starting from such stable solution @xmath85 , we can redo the linear scattering theory , which now contains _ horizontally _ and _ vertically _ propagating fields [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch2d ] ] , @xmath86 with @xmath87 . pretty much like in the one dimensinal case ,",
    "invoking periodicity the solutions are bloch waves , @xmath88 to obtain the condition for the quasimomentum @xmath89 we relate the fields in ( @xmath90 ) with the ones at ( @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath92 ) as marked in figure [ fig : sketch2d ] .",
    "together with ( [ bloch2d ] ) we end up in a homogeneus set of linear equations , see appendix [ app:2d ] for the explicit calculation .",

    "once we have the possibility of building two - dimensional circuit crystals , we can also study the propagation of microwaves on extended metamaterials , or on the interface between them , with effects such as evanescent waves ( i.e. localized modes ) and refraction .",
    "the setup we have in mind is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgrid]a , where we draw a two - dimensional array of lines with an interface separating a region with junctions ( n ) from a region where photons propagate freely ( f ) . we may study how an incoming wave that travels against the boundary enters the n region , inducing reflections , changes of direction and attenuation .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the free region is associated to a vacuum with linear dispersion relation @xmath95 , where @xmath96 the effective velocity of light .",
    "the region with junctions , on the other hand , has an engineered dispersion relation @xmath97 , as discussed above .    when a wave hits the interface between both regions it may reflect and refract .",
    "the wave that penetrates n has to satisfy two constraints : the frequency of the photons must be the same as in f and the component of the wavevector which is parallel to the interface ( @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgrid]a ) also has to be conserved .",
    "both constraints arise from a trivial matching of the time ( @xmath99 ) and spatial ( @xmath98 ) dependence of both waves . following ref .",
    "both constraints may be solved by inspecting the dispersion relation in a contour plot [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgrid]b ] .",
    "once the matching values of the momenta are found [ red in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgrid ] ] the effective group velocities may be computed to determine the trajectory of light . as shown in that plot , in regions where the dispersion relation is convex ,",
    "the velocity may change orientation and give rise to a refracted angle @xmath100 whose associated index of refraction is negative .",
    "the previous phenomenology has also been proposed for a related platform that consists on a two - dimensional array of coupled atom - cavity systems .",
    "working in the single polariton subspace , it is possible to derive the dispersion relation for those artificial photons  @xcite and model the array as an effective photonic material . for a similar band structure and interface as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgrid ] , the _ effective _ electrical and magnetic permitivity become negative , and one obtains again a negative reffraction angle  @xcite .",
    "the engineering of these counterintuitive refraction processes is of great interest in the field of linear optics , as negative indices allow designing perfect lenses  @xcite , but the propagation of photons in these mixed materials may be interesting also for engineering the dynamics of photon wavepackets , photon routing and 100% efficient qubit - qubit interactions based on the perfect refocusing properties of these metamaterials .     and @xmath101 .",

    "so far we have discussed lines with junctions for tailoring photonic transport . in this section",
    "we study the interaction of these metamaterials with superconducting qubits . modifying light - matter interaction",
    "is a cornerstone in quantum optics .",
    "one of the most famous examples is the purcell effect .",
    "confined field enhances or dismisses the spontaneous emission for a quantum emitter .",
    "confinement is usually accomplished by reducing the field to one dimensional waveguides or within cavities or resonators , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref . .",
    "related to this is the suppression of spontaneus emission when the transition frequency for the qubit is placed inside the gap of a photonic crystal @xcite . while the first is at the heart of current circuit qed experiments ,",
    "the second can be observed with our proposal for engineering band gaps . in this section",
    "we modelize such light - matter interaction . in the weak coupling limit",
    "we work a quantum master equation and write it in terms of the green function for the line .",
    "the latter can be calculated by knowing the scattering matrix ( [ tmat ] ) .",
    "finally we give a novel application , as the entanglement generation through disorder . to simplify the discussion , and without loss of generality",
    ", we focus in the one dimensional case .",
    "let us write the qubit - line hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath104 @xmath105 is the qubit hamiltonian and @xmath106 the line expressed in second quantization .",
    "the qubit - photons interaction is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the coupling per mode . in appendix [ app : qlint ] we show that this coupling can be expressed in terms of the green function for the line , @xmath109 , as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the light velocity and @xmath112 is the coupling in a @xmath113 superconducting resonator with fundamental frequency @xmath99 .",
    "this is a very convenient way of expressing the qubit - photon interaction because of two reasons .",
    "first of all , calculation is simplified to the computation of green functions , wich in our case is particularly easy , as it can be derived from the the transfer matrix ( [ ata ] ) as explained _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "[ see appendix @xcite for further details ] .",
    "second and equally important , the strength of the coupling is parameterized by a simple number , @xmath112 , which corresponds to a measurable quantity in qubit - cavity experiments ranging from few to hundreds mhz , from strong to ultrastrong coupling regimes .",
    "let us introduce a master equation for @xmath114 identical qubits placed in the line at positions @xmath115 .",
    "the qubits do not directly interact , but they will do through the line .",
    "the qubit hamiltonian reads , @xmath116 interested as we are here in the qubit dynamics , we can trace out the transmission line . assuming , for simplicity that the weak coupling qubit - line limit holds , one ends up with a master equation for the two qubit reduced density matrix  @xcite @xmath117 - \\sum_{i , j=1}^{n_q } \\gamma_{ij } \\left ( [ \\sigma_i^+,\\sigma_j^- \\varrho ] + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\right ) .\\ ] ] here , @xmath118 is the coherent coupling mediated by the line , the so called _ lamb shift _ with , @xmath119\\ ] ] finally the rates @xmath120 read , @xmath121 with @xmath122 the phenomenological non - radiative rate , coming from the intrinsic losses of the qubits , see appendix [ app : qlint ] for details .",

    "the line gives rise to both both a coherent and incoherent coupling , quantified by @xmath123 and @xmath120 respectively , which depend on the wavelength of the photons , the qubit separation and their energies . in this case without junctions , @xmath124 and thus @xmath125,\\\\ j_{ij } = ( v/2 \\omega ) \\sin[\\omega / v ( x_i - x_j)].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note how each of these couplings can be set independently set to zero .",
    "this has been used for modify the qubits emission going from superradiance and subradiance  @xcite , and it describes recent results in multi - qubit photon scattering  @xcite .      with all this theory at hand we move to study a concrete example where we put together structured lines , qubits , disorder and entanglement .",
    "so far we discussed regular ( periodic ) arrangments of junctions producing an ideal photonic crystal .",
    "it is feasible to produce them , despite fabrication errors , and the junctions within the same sample are very similar",
    ". nevertheless it can be interesting to induce disorder in the scattering elements , either statically , intervening in the design or deposition processes , or dynamically , replacing the junctions with squids and dynamically tuning their frequencies .",
    "disorder may have a dramatic influence in the transport properties of the photonic crystal  @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", the transmission coefficient averaged over an ensemble of random scatterers @xmath126 decays exponentially with increasing length @xmath127 of the disordered media , similar to anderson s localization  @xcite . on the other hand disorder fights against the interference phenomena that gives rise to the existence of band gaps .",
    "the consequence of this competition will be that a sufficiently large disorder could restore the transmission in the frequency range that was originally forbidden  @xcite . in what follows we exploit this phenomenon in connection to a purely quantum effect : the entanglement generation through disordered media .",
    "our model setup consists on two well separated flux qubits , @xmath128 in ( [ qme ] ) and ( [ hls ] ) , which are coupled by a quantum circuit disordedered media  [ fig .",

    "as demonstrated in appendix [ app : g ] the final expressions read , @xmath134 accounting for the coherent coupling with the cross - dissipation rate @xmath135 these interactions compete with the individual decay rates of the qubits , @xmath136 which includes a phenomenological non - radiative decay channel , @xmath122 coming from the intrinsic losses of the qubits [ cf . eq .",

    "moreover , all photons which are not transmitted but reflected add up to the ordinary spontaneous emission rates of the qubits , @xmath142 . and finally ,",
