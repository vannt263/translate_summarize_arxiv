    "in 1963 , the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) was proposed for describing interaction between a single two - state atom and a single near - resonant quantized cavity mode @xcite .",
    "considering the hamiltonian for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field , assuming near resonance and applying the rotating - wave approximation to it , we obtain the hamiltonian of the jcm .",
    "the jcm has been attracting a lot of researchers attention in the field of the quantum optics since 1960s , because it is soluble and fully quantum mechanical .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of the jcm is a phenomenon of collapse and revival of rabi oscillations .",
    "if we put the cavity field into the coherent state initially , the jcm shows the spontaneous periodic collapse and revival of the rabi oscillations in the atomic population inversion during its time evolution .",
    "this phenomenon is regarded as an evidence for discreteness of photons and thus for the quantum nature of the radiation .    however ,",
    "if we put the two - level atom into a certain pure state and the cavity field into a mixed state in thermal equilibrium at initial time , we hardly predict how the system evolves under the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the thermal fluctuation of the radiation field lets the bloch vector develop in time in a confusing manner .",
    "both its norm and direction change hard at random , so that it seems to be in disorder .",
    "when we discuss the thermal jcm , we have to handle an intractable infinite series .",
    "if the single cavity field is resonant with the atom , the @xmath0th term of this intractable infinite series is given by a trigonometric function of @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the variable of time . because it can not be a fourier series , the sum of the series varies in an unpredictable manner as the time @xmath3 progresses .",
    "hioe _ et al_. investigate the long - term behaviour of the jcm from a statistical point of view @xcite .",
    "they find that there exists a mean angular frequency characterizing the highly irregular and random oscillations of the atomic variables in both cases when the initial photon distributions of the cavity field are given by a coherent state and a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "yoo _ et al_. investigate the long - term behaviour of collapse and revivals of the rabi oscillations in the jcm @xcite .",
    "the revivals become less complete and begin to broaden , eventually overlapping each other at still longer times .",
    "the characteristic timescale of this observation is on the order of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a coupling constant of the jc interaction , @xmath3 represents the variable of time and @xmath7 is an average photon number . the saddle point approach is performed to the atomic inversion and interference between revival signals is examined .",
    "their systematic analysis is related to the notion of fractional revivals , which is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "averbukh and perelman study the long - term evolution of quantum wave packets and establish the concept of the fractional revivals @xcite .",
    "they indicate that the fractional revivals can be found in a detailed numerical study of the rydberg wave packets @xcite .",
    "the fractional revivals are also observed in the time evolution of the atomic inversion for the jcm with initial coherent state of the cavity field @xcite .",
    "karatsuba and e.a .",
    "karatsuba study the jc sum , which determines the atomic inversion @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an approximation of the jc sum is evaluated with the theorem on the approximation of a trigonometric sum by a shorter one .",
    "dealing with the problem in this way , main contributions are extracted as a finite series from the jc sum . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the jc sum for a coherent state of a single cavity mode is investigated .",
    "asymptotic formulae of it are derived using the functional equation for the jacobi theta - functions .",
    "the obtained formulae make it be possible to predetermine the details of the behaviour of the inversion and to describe jc collapses and revivals on various time intervals .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , azuma and ban show that the time evolution of the bloch vector under the thermal jcm has a quasiperiodic structure . because of the quasiperiodicity , the dynamics of the bloch vector has countably infinite incommensurate angular frequencies , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where the variable @xmath0 comes from the number of photons of a cavity mode and the series @xmath9 lets @xmath10 be incommensurate .",
    "this implies that the system has countably infinite angular momenta as integrals of motion , @xmath11 for @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that we can not describe the motion of the bloch vector as a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom , for example , the @xmath0-body problem in classical mechanics .",
    "hence , we can expect the motion of the bloch vector to be equivalent to a hidden - variable model that has a countably infinite number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we regard a hidden - variable model as a model of classical theory in contrast to quantum theory .    in the above paragraph",
    ", we suppose that the dynamics of the bloch vector has to be written as a hidden - variable model .",
    "the reason why is as follows .",
    "the dynamics of the bloch vector is derived from the schrdinger equation with the jc hamiltonian . for describing an explicit form of the bloch vector , what we apply to the quantum mechanical state in fact are only providing the initial state of the cavity field as a density matrix of a mixed state and tracing out its hilbert space . because we trace out the hilbert space of the cavity field , the entanglement between the single atom and the cavity field is removed .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the bloch vector has to be described with a hidden - variable model that exhibits local determinism .",
    "maxwell s electromagnetic theory and the fluid dynamics give us typical examples of hidden - variable theory @xcite .    here , we examine the meanings of the hidden - variable model precisely .",
    "the initial state of the atom and the cavity photons is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are density operators of the atom and the cavity photons , respectively .",
    "[ the indices a and p stand for the atom and the photon , respectively .",
    "] then , the time evolution under the jc hamiltonian lets the subsystems of the atom and the cavity photons be entangled .",
    "this implies that the whole density operator is not generally given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the density operator of eq .",
    "( [ separable - state-1 ] ) is called classically correlated and there are no quantum correlations between the atom and the photons .",
    "it is indicated that the system is described with quantum logic in most cases if its density operator is not given by the form of eq .",
    "( [ separable - state-1 ] ) @xcite . to obtain the bloch vector , we trace out the hilbert space of the cavity photons as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is not given by the form of eq .",
    "( [ separable - state-1 ] ) .",
    "because quantum entanglement between the atom and the cavity photons is removed , @xmath21 is described with a hidden - variable model @xcite . from these considerations , we conclude that the bloch vector can be described with a classical model .",
    "moreover , the bloch vector has a countably infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , the bloch vector has to be equivalent to a hidden - variable model with a countably infinite number of degrees of freedom , which admits maxwell s electromagnetic theory , the fluid dynamics and other classical field theories .    on the one hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider quasiperiodicity to be the most important factor in understanding confusion of the bloch vector s trajectories under the thermal jcm . on the other hand , in this paper , we try to find physical meanings of it by drawing analogy between the bloch vector and a compressible fluid .",
    "we show that we can rewrite the time evolution of the bloch vector under the thermal jcm as a compressible inviscid flow with zero vorticity .",
