    "the giant  region n66 is the largest , brightest star forming region in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the populous star cluster ngc346 embedded in the nebula is home to several dozen early type stars including a dozen of spectral types o7 and earlier .",
    "two arcminutes to the east lies the massive , luminous wn+ob system hd5980 which underwent a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) outburst in 1994 @xcite .",
    "these stars are the main source of ionization in the nebula .",
    "n66 also contains at least one known supernova remnant ( snr ) , snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "_ einstein _ x - ray observations showed a bright source in n66 tentatively identified as a snr @xcite .",
    "radio observations by @xcite showed bright , extended , thermal emission at 408 , 843 and 5000 mhz corresponding to the  region , but no clear sign of the snr .",
    "optical observations also showed only the extremely bright nebular emission but no filamentary structure associated with the snr .",
    "however , @xcite discovered faint , high - velocity h@xmath1  emission in a long - slit spectrum across n66 and suggested the existence of a snr .",
    "subsequently , @xcite subtracted smoothed h@xmath1  data from 843 mhz radio continuum observations and revealed a remnant @xmath23.2  ( @xmath255 pc at an smc distance of 59 kpc ) in diameter and confirmed the remnant snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of snr0057@xmath07226  with asca @xcite showed that the spectrum can be modeled as a hot thermal plasma .",
    "high - resolution x - ray observations of n66 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "@xcite show a 130@xmath3100  region of extended , center - bright , thermal emission corresponding to the snr .",
    "these high - resolution data show snr0057@xmath07226  to have relatively uniform surface brightness and no clear temperature gradient from center to rim .",
    "difference imaging techniques applied to recent radio observations @xcite at 1.42 , 2.37 , and 4.80 ghz ( 20 , 13 and 6 cm ) show snr0057@xmath07226  to be a non - thermal , limb - brightened shell with a spectral index of approximately @xmath1=@xmath00.17 ( s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the x - ray and radio emitting regions are similar in extent at a resolution of @xmath220 .",
    "hence , the @xcite estimate of angular size is probably too large , and the x - ray / radio snr is roughly 36 @xmath3 28 pc in extent .",
    "thus , snr0057@xmath07226  may be a member of the `` mixed morphology '' class of snrs @xcite , with a radio shell and filled - center x - ray emission , although the presence of hd  5980 along the sight line confuses the situation .",
    "@xcite resolve x - ray emission from hd  5980 itself for the first time , and note similarities with the galactic object @xmath5 carinae , which has diffuse surrounding x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite mention a possible association of hd  5980 and snr0057@xmath07226 , but fuv absorption studies have clearly determined that hd  5980 is behind the snr .",

    "@xcite also see absorption at @xmath2@xmath8300 km  s@xmath7  in  and  in _ fuse _ observations of hd5980 and conclude that the star must lie behind the receding shell of snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "@xcite also find that a _ fuse _ spectrum of sk80 ( av232 ) , an o7ia star @xmath21  southeast of hd5980 but also seen in projection within the x - ray emission , shows none of the high - velocity absorption seen toward hd5980 .",
    "since sk80 lies closer to the x - ray edge of the remnant , we might expect a lower line - of - sight velocity for snr gas in this sight line .",
    "however , the  absorption profile near the smc systemic velocity ( @xmath2150 km  s@xmath7 ) is indistinguishable from that of hd5980 .",
    "thus , sk80 must either lie within or in front of the remnant .",
    "far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations are useful in the study of snrs .",
    "several strong emission lines including  @xmath91548,1550 , @xmath91238,1242 , and especially  @xmath91032,1038 are good shock diagnostics and are produced in regions where the temperature is lower than typical x - ray producing regions and higher than regions of bright optical emission @xcite .",
    "emission , in particular , arises in gas at temperatures near @xmath10 k  a condition almost never reached by photoionization  and is thus a sensitive tracer of shock - heated material .    in this paper",
    "we present a _ fuse _",
    "observation of emission at the x - ray edge of snr0057@xmath07226   that shows strong emission in  @xmath91032,1038 and  @xmath11977 .",

    "a summary is presented in  5 .",
    "figure  1 shows images of snr0057@xmath07226  and its surroundings .",
    "the left panel shows an h@xmath1 + [ ] emission - line image taken with the curtis schmidt telescope at ctio in 1999 , december .",
    "these data are described more thoroughly by @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows a recent x - ray image of ngc346 from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , obtained courtesy of @xcite .",
    "these data show snr0057@xmath07226  clearly as a bright , extended source .",
    "unfortunately , the acis detector gaps partially obscure the southwestern edge of the snr and some of the core of ngc346 itself .",
    "six stars within n66/ngc346 are part of the _ fuse _ hot ism team program and are marked with small boxes in figure  1 .",
    "four of these targets are within the crowded core of the cluster itself .",
    "the cluster targets were observed with the 4@xmath320  mdrs aperture .",
    "the remaining two ( hd5980 and sk80 ) lie about two arcminutes to the east of the cluster in projection toward snr0057@xmath07226  and were observed with the 30@xmath330  lwrs aperture .",
    "_ fuse _ has three spectral apertures @xcite ; the lwrs and the mdrs apertures are centered 209  from each other .",
    "thus , while the mdrs aperture was being used to observe stars in ngc346 , the lwrs aperture fell serendipitously on other parts of the sky .",
    "in one case ( p20305 , henceforth position  1 ) , the lwrs aperture fell 75  east of hd5980 on the eastern x - ray edge of snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "this spectrum shows bright emission lines of  @xmath11977.020 and  @xmath91031.926 , 1036.617 .",
    "a very faint continuum underlies the bright emission lines at a flux level of @xmath12 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  @xmath7 . in another case ( p20302 ,",
    "henceforth position  2 ) the lwrs aperture fell in a region north of hd5980 outside the boundaries of the snr s x - ray emission .",
    "this sight line shows a weak continuum spectrum similar to that at position 1 .",
    "we use this sight line to characterize the fuv background of n66 . the _ fuse _ observations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the positions of the _ fuse _ lwrs apertures for positions 1 and 2 as large boxes .",
    "the third _ fuse _ aperture , the 125@xmath320  hirs aperture , lies halfway between the other apertures . in several observations of stars in ngc346",
    "the hirs aperture fell on x - ray bright regions of snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "however , no flux was detected in these spectra .",
    "since the hirs aperture has less than 3% of the collecting area of lwrs for detecting diffuse emission , this negative result is consistent .",
    "_ fuse _ has four independent spectral channels ( in _ fuse _ nomenclature , lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , and sic2 ) , and because of thermal effects onboard the spacecraft , relative channel alignments shift in a complicated manner @xcite .",
    "this can cause significant complications for diffuse source observations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the spacecraft guides on the lif1 channel , which also has the highest fuv throughput near 1035 .",
    "the other three channels tend to drift as much as 8  over the course of a few orbits with respect to lif1 if no realignments are made .",
    "for this reason , we use only lif1 data for stellar targets whenever possible .",
    "lif1 does not cover wavelengths below 987 .",
    "thus we use the lower - throughput sic2 channel to observe  @xmath11977 .",
    "all four channels cover the 1035  region containing , so a direct comparison of  and  is possible .",
    "the six stellar datasets were reduced using the methods described by @xcite and references therein .",
    "spectral resolution in these data is 1520 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the lwrs data were reduced using calfuse v2.0.5 and observations were combined by channel .",
    "the region around 1032  was examined in all four channels to determine the relative shifts that exist in the wavelength solutions relative to lif1 .",
    "we increased the signal - to - noise ratio by coadding the two lif channels to create a composite  spectrum .",
    "this does not significantly degrade the spectral resolution , which for an aperture - filling extended source is @xmath20.34  ( 106 km  s@xmath7  at 1032 ) .",
    "flux is present in the two sic channels as well and closely resembles that in the lif channels , but with lower s / n .",
    "the two sic channels were coadded for the  emission .",
    "figure  2 shows these data in comparison to position  2 which sampled a sight line outside the snr .",
    "seven longslit echelle spectra of the n66 region were obtained on the 4-m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) during 2000 december and 2001 december .",
    "these observations are summarized in table  2 and the slit positions are shown in figure  1 as dashed lines . for both observing runs , a 79 line mm@xmath7 echelle grating and long - focus red camera were used .",
    "the decker was opened to its maximum extent giving a useful slit length on the sky of 35 .",
    "the slit width was set to 165 .",
    "the cross - dispersing grating was replaced with a flat mirror and an order - separating filter ( @xmath14=6580 , @xmath15=150 ) was used to isolate the spectral region around the h@xmath1  line .",
    "[ ] @xmath96548,6583 also falls within the spectral range sampled .",
    "data reduction was performed with iraf using the quadproc and longslit packages .",
    "trim , bias and dark current calibration were performed first .",
    "the images were next processed to remove the tilt of the ccd axis with respect to the slit .",
    "this rendered the stellar spectra horizontal along a row .",
    "thorium - argon lamp spectral lines were traced and fit to correct for curvature in the cross - dispersion direction and provide a dispersion solution .",
    "final wavelength calibration was performed using the terrestrial airglow lines present in the observations themselves .",
    "the result is a rectified spectrum with dispersion along the x - axis and the spatial dimension along the y - axis .",
    "the calibrated data cover @xmath235 of sky at a spatial resolution of @xmath21  ( 0267 pix@xmath7 ) and spectral resolution of @xmath210 km  s@xmath7  ( 0.082  pix@xmath7 = 3.7 km  s@xmath7  pix@xmath7 ) .",
    "we present three of the spectra in two - dimensional format in figure  3 , where the wavelength scale has been converted to velocity .",
    "the lwrs aperture of position  1 lies 75  east of hd5980 and coincides with the edge of bright , soft x - ray emission ( figure  1 ) .",
    "strong  emission is seen in both lines of the doublet as well as  @xmath11977.02 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we detect no other lines in the _ fuse _ wavelength range ( 9051187 ) besides airglow .",
    "in addition to the emission lines , a faint continuum is seen in the position  1 spectrum ( f@xmath16  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  @xmath7 ) .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with an early - type star and shows many of the same ism absorption features seen in other _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "the unidentified star in the lwrs aperture visible in the optical image ( figure  1 ) is not the source of the fuv continuum .",
    "it does not appear in fuv uit ( @xmath17 ) images of the region @xcite and is of spectral type a or later .",
    "in contrast to position  1 , there are no  and  emissions detected at position  2",
    ". this aperture fell an arcminute northeast of the edge of the snr in a field empty of bright stars , uv - bright or otherwise .",
    "however , a similar stellar continuum can be seen in this spectrum .",
    "the faint continuum observed at both positions is due to dust - scattered starlight from the many fuv - bright sources nearby .",
    "a similar effect at longer uv wavelengths was seen in iue spectra of other regions in the smc @xcite .",
    "any emission from the snr will suffer absorption from the intervening smc and galactic ism .",
    "fortunately , there is little molecular hydrogen absorption in the vicinity of 1032 ; the only ism absorption comes from smc and galactic .",
    "we use the continuum - normalized  absorption profile of sk80 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  80 ) as our absorption model .",
    "a gaussian profile divided by the absorption model was convolved with a 106 km  s@xmath7  aperture function .",
    "the gaussian parameters were varied and the resulting models were fit to the observed @xmath111032 line profile .",
    "the best fit parameters were : @xmath18=228 km  s@xmath7 , fwhm=159 km  s@xmath7 , and peak flux=2.23@xmath19 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  @xmath7 .",
    "the total flux of the intrinsic gaussian function is 1.27@xmath19 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  compared with an observed flux of 8.68@xmath20 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13 .",
    "both the fit to the data and the intrinsic gaussian profile are shown in the top panel of figure  4 .",
    "the  @xmath111032 line should be twice the intensity of the @xmath111038 line in the absence of resonance scattering and self - absorption . however , this ratio can vary as a function of velocity within the line profile .",
    "the observed @xmath111032/@xmath111038 ratio is close to two on the blue - shifted side of the line but becomes significantly higher on the red - shifted wing .",
    "since smc and galactic  absorption affect both lines in a proportional manner , we conclude that resonance scattering and self - absorption is minimal but that significant absorption from molecular hydrogen5 - 0(p1)h@xmath21  @xmath111038.156 and 5 - 0(r2)h@xmath21  @xmath111038.690affects the weaker line .",
    "we can characterize the @xmath111038 emission using the intrinsic emission profile determined from the @xmath111032 line . in this case",
    ", the absorption model was allowed to vary ; a simulated molecular absorption spectrum was calculated with the _ fuse _ spectral simulator code fsim and the sk80 @xmath111032  absorption profile ( scaled by a square root ) was multiplied in .",
    "( since @xmath22 in the optically thin limit , @xmath23 . )",
    "the resulting model was multiplied by the intrinsic gaussian profile determined above and convolved with the aperture function to simulate the observed @xmath111038 line .",
    "we first fit the @xmath111038 emission using two molecular hydrogen components : a galactic component @xcite ( v=0 km  s@xmath7 , n(h@xmath21)=@xmath24 , b=5 km  s@xmath7 , t=150 k ) and an smc component ( v=115 km  s@xmath7 , n(h@xmath21)=@xmath25 , b=15 km  s@xmath7 , t=400 k ) slightly modified from @xcite .",
    "however , this did not produce enough absorption on the red side of the emission .",
    "a third component , representing swept - up material from the snr at v@xmath2155 km  s@xmath7  improves the fit ( figure  4 , middle panel ) , but requires an unphysically large turbulent velocity for a good fit .",
    "there could be many components at a range of velocities in the turbulent , post - shock gas which might account for the enhanced absorption .",
    "no such high - velocity components are seen by @xcite .",
    "the  @xmath11977 emission is strongly affected by resonance scattering and self - absorption .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum shows that the galactic and smc components are saturated @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to fit the observed  profile .",
    "the measured flux , 6.3@xmath20 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13 , is a lower limit to the intrinsic flux . overlaying the derived  @xmath111032 profile ( figure  4 , bottom panel )",
    "provides a first order assessment of how this line might be affected if its intrinsic line width is similar to .",
    "apart from  and  ( and geocoronal airglow ) , there are no other lines detected . in a spectrum of the cygnus loop , a typical middle - aged snr ,",
    "the next brightest lines to  and  were [ ] @xmath111146 and @xmath91063,1074 at @xmath25% of the observed  flux @xcite .",
    "such weak emission would not be detected in the spectrum of snr0057@xmath07226 , especially considering the lower abundances of these elements in the smc .",
    "the seven echelle observations cut across much of the n66 nebulosity in figure  1 including the core of ngc346 and the outlying regions . three spectra cross significant portions of the snr and",
    "show faint high- and low - velocity emission .",
    "the data show both h@xmath1  and [ ] emission at a velocity resolution of @xmath215 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we find the nebula itself to be surprisingly quiescent on the large scale given the violence of strong stellar winds and ongoing star formation .",
    "the bright nebular emission can be fit with a single - component gaussian with v@xmath26=157.7 km  s@xmath7 , fwhm=34.7 km  s@xmath7 . assuming a temperature of @xmath27 k in the photoionized gas",
    ", we derive a bulk turbulence of 23.8 km  s@xmath7(b=14.3 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "this degree of turbulence is typical of magellanic  regions but much lower than that seen in giant  regions such as 30 doradus and nebulae in m101 and m33 @xcite .",
    "the thermal fwhm of [ ] is narrower than that of h@xmath1  by the square root of the ratio of their ionic masses ( i.e. by @xmath28=3.7 ) .",
    "thus [ ] emission is a more sensitive probe of velocity structure than h@xmath1 . however , these lines are usually much weaker than h@xmath1 , particularly in the low - nitrogen smc ism , and are often completely undetectable in smc echelle spectra .",
    "four of the echelle spectra ( both hd5980 pointings , ngc346-wb3 + 4 and ngc346-wb6 ) have usable [ ] data .",
    "these show @xmath29 km  s@xmath7  and a @xmath30=22.8 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "assuming a temperature of 10@xmath31 k , we derive a bulk turbulence of 17.5 km  s@xmath7  ( b=10.5 km  s@xmath7 ) , also typical for ordinary magellanic  regions .",
    "the two spectra which cut through ngc346 show an expansion feature bounded by the bright h@xmath1  rim visible in figure  1 surrounding the cluster core .",
    "( ngc346-wb1 samples the same region as the latter two spectra , but has a high sky brightness masking any [ ] emission . )",
    "the data show a maximum expansion velocity of 14 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this expansion is presumably driven by the stellar winds of the stars located within the bubble .",
    "the ngc346 expansion feature is also detected in the h@xmath1  data , but only in that a pair of gaussians are needed to fit the broad h@xmath1  profile , rather than a single component .",
    "meanwhile , the east - west hd5980 data cut through n66c , a compact  region to the west of hd5980 and north east of the cluster core .",
    "the [ ] data reveal an expansion feature here with @xmath32 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "high- and low - velocity h@xmath1  emission appear in the four echelle observations which cross snr0057@xmath07226  ( hd5980 ns and ew , sk80 ns and ew ) .",
    "three of these spectra are shown in figure  3 ; the fourth spectrum ( sk80 ew ) is of low signal - to - noise and intersects only the edge of the remnant .",
    "the faint , higher velocity emission in these spectra arises in shocks associated with the snr .",
    "it is weaker than the photoionized nebular emission by a factor of @xmath270 and has a very low signal to noise ratio .",
    "the snr emission is quite patchy : blobs with widths of @xmath210  ( @xmath23 pc ) are seen in the position - velocity diagrams ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we find high - velocity features all across the face of snr0057@xmath07226  with higher velocity emission typically toward the center suggesting an expanding shell .",
    "the fastest emission is at v@xmath33335 km  s@xmath7  about 15  ( 4 pc ) south of hd5980 ( this is also the region of peak x - ray brightness ) .",
    "if the systemic velocity of the snr is taken to be the same as the n66 ism , this gives an expansion velocity of @xmath34 km  s@xmath7 , consistent with strong  production by the shock front .",
    "the h@xmath1  emission from the approaching side of the snr is also seen in figure  3 , though it is even fainter than the receding side . in the few cases where the blue - shifted material is discernible from the gaussian wings of the bright nebular emission",
    ", we see velocities as low as v@xmath35 km  s@xmath7 . as with the receding side of the snr",
    ", the material with the largest velocity offsets tends to be closest to the center of the remnant .",
    "approximate spectrophotometry was performed on the echelle data using a flux - calibrated h@xmath1 + [ ] image of n66 obtained from @xcite .",
    "comparing profiles from the image with wavelength - integrated intensity along the slit gave a conversion factor of @xmath24.5@xmath36 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  count@xmath7 .",
    "we use this value to measure fluxes and surface brightnesses for different patches of snr emission in the spectra ( figure  3 ) .",
    "a gaussian profile was fit to the main nebular emission ( v@xmath37158 km  s@xmath7 ) over a range @xmath38 along the slit and divided from the data .",
    "a background level was then subtracted and the remaining counts within a wavelength ( velocity ) range @xmath39-@xmath40 were summed .",
    "the summed counts were converted into a total flux .",
    "surface brightness was determined by dividing the total flux by the area covered by the extraction region ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "typical observed surface brightnesses were @xmath42 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  arcsec@xmath43  with a standard deviation of 50% .",
    "there is a faint patch of h@xmath1  emission at 215 km  s@xmath7  at the position  1 lwrs aperture ( figure  3 , top panel ) .",
    "this corresponds reasonably well with the observed  emission at 228 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we measure the surface brightness of this emission patch to be @xmath44 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath13  arcsec@xmath43  over a slit range 5779  east of hd5980 .",
    "the detection of  emission as well as the kinematics present in the h@xmath1  echelle data imply the presence of a strong shock in n66 associated with snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "the snr shock model was also favored by @xcite for the high velocity absorption towards hd5980 .",
    "detection of the front side of snr0057@xmath07226  has not been clearly established because the low velocity components cited by @xcite were detected at such a marginal level . in any event , the near side of the snr is considerably more difficult to detect both in emission and absorption than the back side .",
    "optical emission from the  region complicates the situation and masks the morphology of the snr .    in the following discussion",
    "we adopt a working model of the physical association of various components in the n66 region .",
    "a roughly spherical snr is located on the near side of n66 .",
    "the rear side of the snr is propagating into relatively denser nebula while the near side is propagating through the more rarefied smc ism .",
    "hd5980 lies behind the remnant , embedded within n66 .",

    "h@xmath1 , we measure the `` completeness '' of the shock .",
    "then we discuss the relationship between the snr and its surroundings and the implications of this analysis for observing snrs in other  regions .      in the n66 reference frame ( v@xmath26=@xmath8158 km  s@xmath7 ) , the material at position  1 has a radial velocity of @xmath870 km  s@xmath7  while toward hd5980 , @xmath45 km  s@xmath7 . from x - ray and radio images",

    "this position is also consistent with the location of the highest - velocity h@xmath1  emission ( figure  3 ) . using the projected distances from this center and the two radial velocity measurements ,",
    "we derive a radius of curvature for the shock front of 80@xmath47  and an expansion velocity for the  gas of v@xmath48 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this places the observed x - ray edge on the eastern side of the shock front inclined @xmath260  to our line of sight .",
    "the expansion velocity of 147 km  s@xmath7  is not the shock speed , but rather the bulk velocity of the postshock material which should be between 0.75 and 1.0 times the shock speed .",
    "first we caculate shock models for comparison against the observations .",
    "the models were calculated using an updated version of the code described by @xcite .",
    "the main input parameters are the shock velocity , the preshock density and the elemental abundances .",

    "the calculation is followed until the the recombination zone is complete and the gas temperature has reached about 1000 k. we present the intensities of selected lines from the shock models in table  3 .",
    "the intensities are relative to h@xmath1=100 and the flux from nearby multiplet lines of an ion have been summed . the  line flux produced by a shock increases sharply as a function of shock velocity in the range 150  200 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "shocks below @xmath2160 km  s@xmath7  do not produce much  and thus this represents a lower limit to the actual shock velocity in the snr . over this same range of shock velocities ,",
    "the  flux remains nearly constant .",
    "the changing ratio of i()/i ( ) is due to the increasing ionization of oxygen at higher velocities .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , the  is strongly affected by absorption and scattering , and so it is not possible for us to derive an accurate assessment of the intrinsic ratio of i()/i ( ) in the spectrum of position  1 .",
    "however , we note that using the total ( corrected )  flux with the observed  flux places an upper limit of f()/f()@xmath503 . ignoring the effect of differential reddening for the moment ,",
    "this clearly points us toward the lower end of the velocity range where  is produced .",
    "based on this ratio , the observed expansion velocity and the shock velocity requirements for  production , we adopt 160 km  s@xmath7  as a representative shock velocity at position  1 and use details from the model at this velocity below .",

    "less reddening ( e(b@xmath0v)=0.08 , c@xmath65=3.0 ) would yield n@xmath70 @xmath49 , @xmath71 dyne @xmath13 .",

    "this variation in pressures within the same remnant suggests local density and pressure enhancements caused by reverse shocks from blastwave - cloud interactions .",
    "we have only two widely - separated measurements for snr0057@xmath07226  and can say nothing so specific but the high pressure and density at position  1 as well as the x - ray emission morphology suggest similar shock - cloud interactions .",
    "the shock models discussed above predict the total column depths of ions produced in the post - shock flow .",
    "@xcite measured the column depths of several highly ionized species in the high - velocity component toward hd5980 ( their table  1 ) and conclude that a snr shock is the most likely production mechanism for these ions in the observed quantities .",
    "@xcite presented data on other ions not available to _ fuse_. in figure  5 , we present the observed column depths of these fuv ions and the values predicted by the models with v@xmath75=160 , 180 and 200 km  s@xmath7 . the ions are ordered according to the ionization potential needed to produce them .",
    "the relative column depths of all the ions down to  are well matched by the 160 km  s@xmath7  model .",
    "the higher velocity models predict too much  relative to the other high ionization ions .",
    "the column depths scale linearly with preshock density ( all the models were run with n@xmath76 = 1 @xmath49 ) .",
    "the offset between the 160 km  s@xmath7  model and the observations is @xmath77 dex , so a preshock density of @xmath78 can reproduce the observed column depths for the high ionization lines .",
    "the shock velocity and preshock density toward hd5980 are thus in good agreement with our measurements for position  1 .",
    "the behavior of the low ionization lines is drastically different . for  and , all the models predict column densities that are an order of magnitude higher than the observations ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "this dearth of low - ionization material can also be seen by comparing the observed and calculated ratio of  and h@xmath1 .",
    "the shock models ( which have been calculated to the point of complete recombination ) predict i()/i(h@xmath1)=3.3 for @xmath79=160 km  s@xmath7  and smc abundances .",
    "the observed ratio at position  1 is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 indicates the surface brightness and @xmath82 the aperture filling factor of the relevant emission .",
    "we assume the reddening correction @xmath57=4.5 as discussed above ; reddening at h@xmath1  is moderate and we adopt @xmath83=1.24 .",
    "the filling factor @xmath82 for each aperture is more uncertain .",
    "we assume @xmath84 as discussed above .",
    "it is difficult to say where emission does and does not appear at a fine scale in the low s / n echelle data .",
    "the h@xmath1  aperture was chosen carefully to encompass only the faint emission in figure  3 , but we estimate that @xmath85 is still @xmath2@xmath86 .",
    "these values give i()/i(h@xmath1)@xmath3718 .",
    "uncertainties in the filling factors , reddening , and surface brightnesses probably make this ratio uncertain by a factor of 2 , but the ratio is still significantly higher than the predicted ratio of 3.3 .",
    "the weakness of h@xmath1  emission compared with  at position  1 suggests the presence of an incomplete shock .",
    "there are many cases where incomplete shocks are observed in individual filaments or small portions of snrs @xcite ; however , these regions are all at sub - parsec scales .",
    "the lwrs aperture at position  1 is sampling a region of snr0057@xmath07226  roughly 8 pc across .",
    "furthermore , the observed h@xmath1  surface brightness does not vary strongly between different portions of the snr implying that the conditions at position  1 are typical of the remnant as a whole . in figure  3 , we see weak snr h@xmath1  emission or none at all .",
    "this is a large object with moderate shock velocities implying that it is a middle - aged remnant like the cygnus loop or the vela snr ; most of the optical emission from these remnants comes from complete , radiative shocks and these remnants are bright in h@xmath1 . if some portions of snr0057@xmath07226  were recombinationally complete , we would expect to see h@xmath1  emission @xmath210 times brighter than is observed .",
    "thus , it appears that there is a global effect preventing the cooler parts of the recombination flow from forming .",
    "we argue that the gas at the back end of the post - shock flow is being prevented from recombining by the ionizing flux from the bright stars in n66 .",
    "there are eleven stars of spectral type o6.5 or earlier located 2  ( 35 pc , in projection ) to the west of snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "the combined ionizing flux from ngc346 is 4.0@xmath310@xmath87 erg s@xmath7 @xcite or @xmath21.5@xmath310@xmath88 ionizing photons s@xmath7 .",
    "hd5980 itself contributes @xmath89 ionizing photons s@xmath7 . using basic ionization / recombination equations from @xcite",
    "we find that this photon flux in a medium with density @xmath25 @xmath49 will yield an ionized sphere over 100 pc in radius .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that n66 is density bounded and that 45% of the ionizing photons from cluster stars escape to ionize the general smc ism .",
    "this zone of ionization could encompass snr0057@xmath07226  and affect the ionization balance in the recombining post - shock gas .",
    "the dynamical time scale of the shock is of order a few hundred years .",
    "the photoionization time scales are much shorter ( @xmath2100 days ) , while the recombination times are longer ( of order 10,000 yr ) .",
    "thus the ionizing flux will suppress h@xmath1  emission .",
    "the strength and spectral energy distribution of the local ionizing flux will affect the column densities of the low and moderately ionized species . in theory",
    ", much of the discrepancy between the modeled and observed  and  columns towards hd5980 ( figure  5 ) could be due to iron and silicon being ionized to higher ionization stages .",
    "if the best fit model is scaled up to n@xmath90 @xmath49 , the  column is underpredicted by about 0.3 dex .",
    "this is clearly not enough to explain the 1.9 dex discrepancy in the  column , but the stellar spectrum extends out to @xmath250 ev @xcite and the local flux could be producing .",
    "however , no such discrepancies are seen in the  and  columns .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the sight line to hd5980 is passing through a small region where the swept up column is lower than average for snr0057@xmath07226 .",
    "while the  zone is complete , the  zone would be incomplete regardless of ionizing radiation . a self - consistent shock model calculation that includes a photoionizing field",
    "is necessary to predict the column densities and the h@xmath1  flux accurately . while such modeling is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "we conclude that the local ionizing field must have a significant effect on the observed characteristics of snr0057@xmath07226  as a whole .",
    "the emission and absorption data discussed here lead to a schematic structure for the n66snr region shown in figure  6 .",
    "snr0057@xmath07226  lies on the near side of n66 and is encountering the denser nebular material on its back side .",
    "position  1 is located at the edge of the x - ray emission ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the observed radial velocity of  and h@xmath1  emission at position  1 is @xmath2225 km  s@xmath7 .",

    "also it is @xmath275 km  s@xmath7  higher than the systemic velocity of n66 ( @xmath8158 km  s@xmath7 ) , which we would expect for material viewed tangentially at the edge of the expanding remnant . either the systemic velocity of the snr and n66 differ by @xmath270 km  s@xmath7 , or the observed x - ray edge ( a portion of which is position  1 ) does not represent the actual limb of the snr shock",
    ". the latter is assumed in figure  6 .",
    "we propose that the x - ray emission arises over a spherical cap where the shock has encountered and heated denser material .",
    "the remnant is not yet even half - way submerged in the n66 material , and thus the observed radius of x - ray emission is smaller than the actual blast wave radius .",
    "the observed x - ray edge at position  1 is inclined to our line of sight by @xmath260 . hd5980 and",
    "the other uv - bright stars are located within n66 and have ionized a region of surrounding material .",
    "the combined stellar winds and thermal pressure have formed a slowly expanding envelope around the cluster core . since high - velocity absorption",
    "is not seen in the spectrum of sk80 @xcite , it must lie within or in front of the snr .",
    "hd5980 lies behind the remnant and affects the ionization balance in the swept - up gas , preventing the formation of , , ,  and other low - excitation species .",
    "the bright nebular emission seen surrounding the uv bright stars of n66 arises in dense material behind an ionized layer .",
    "the approaching snr material is apparent in h@xmath1  in figure  3 , but has not been conclusively identified in fuv spectra .",
    "if the far side of the remnant is seen near @xmath2300 km  s@xmath7  and if the snr is centered at the smc systemic velocity of @xmath2155 km  s@xmath7 , we expect the nearside absorption to be seen near v=10 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this region is essentially masked by galactic absorption making it difficult to detect the snr .",
    "@xcite compared the  spectra of sk80 and hd5980 near zero velocity and found no difference .",
    "however , both of these sight lines are toward the remnant and may contain nearly identical foreground  columns .",

    "a comparison of the averaged , normalized  profiles from these four targets and the two sight lines projected within the snr is shown in figure  7 .",
    "we find a small but systematic excess in  absorption near v=0 km  s@xmath7  in the two remnant profiles .",
    "the difference represents an extra  column density of about @xmath91 @xmath13 or about @xmath92 that of the backside value reported by @xcite .",
    "we also find that the velocity centroid of the hd5980/sk80 zero velocity absorption is shifted by about @xmath810 km  s@xmath7  with respect to the ngc346 galactic absorption .",
    "this is not too different from the velocity found by @xcite for  and  absorption features that they attribute to front - side snr material .",
    "recent work by @xcite on galactic halo  absorption has shown significant variations in  column over as little as 3 .",
    "the variation in n ( ) between the four ngc346 targets ( mean separation 19 ) is 9% ( the maximum variation between two measurements is 12% ) while the variation between the two snr sight lines ( separation @xmath931 ) is only 8% , comparable to the uncertainties due to continuum placement , noise , and limits of integration .",
    "however , the cluster and snr stars show a relative difference of 53% in the zero - velocity  column over @xmath22 .",
    "because of the potential galactic halo variation on small scales , the matter of frontside absorption remains inconclusive .",
    "however , it is plausible we are seeing front side absorption near v=@xmath810 km  s@xmath7  in the hd5980/sk80 data .",
    "if true , then sk80 would be inside snr0057@xmath07226 , as shown in figure  6 .",

    "core - collapse supernovae arise from massive stars often formed in clusters and associations  the same massive stars which photoionize their surrounding gas and create bright  regions .",
    "massive sn progenitors can not migrate far from their birth places in their short lifetimes and thus snrs associated with h  ii regions should occur frequently . to various degrees ,",
    "this is not seen in optical snr surveys of nearby galaxies .",

    "discussions of selection effects usually point toward `` confusion '' as being responsible for incompleteness of optical snr surveys in crowded and complex regions of emission .",

    "the mechanism we propose in  4.2 seems to be a more plausible explanation for why the optical snr searches miss some snrs and not others in confused regions .",
    "if a supernova occurs close enough to ionizing stars , the potential bright optical snr emission in h@xmath1  and  is prevented from forming and no optical snr can be detected , especially against bright nebular emission .",
