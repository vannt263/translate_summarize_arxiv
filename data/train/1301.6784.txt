    "hierarchical structure formation drives the growth of mass and size of galaxies with redshift @xcite . in this picture",
    "the mass and size of galaxies grow at a similar rate . recently",
    "a population of small but relatively massive elliptical galaxies has been observed at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however at low redshift these galaxies are much more rare @xcite , whereas there is a rich population of elliptical galaxies with similar mass but which are considerably larger in size @xcite .",
    "this suggests that small and massive galaxies grow in size without acquiring much mass , which can not be explained from major mergers as observed in hierarchical structure formation simulations ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that dry minor mergers can cause a considerable growth in size without much increasing the mass of the galaxy , whereas major mergers tend to increase the mass without much increasing the size @xcite .",
    "several studies on the topic seem to contradict each other , some argue that minor mergers can drive the observed growth e.g. @xcite . others claim that the observed size growth in simulations is not sufficient if one takes into account cosmological scaling relations @xcite . encouraged by this discrepancy in the literature we decided to perform a series of simulations in which we model the encounters between compact massive galaxies and smaller , lower - mass counterparts . in our parameter search",
    "we included mass ratios from 1:1 all the way to 1:160 . even though such low - mass encounters are unlikely to be common @xcite , they approach a continuous in - fall of material on the parent galaxy .    with the merger simulations we study the growth in mass , size and the effect on the shape of the merger product .",
    "our simulations are performed using the bonsai tree code @xcite with up to 17.2 million equal - mass particles .",
    "this includes the dark - matter as well as the baryonic matter . in our simulations",
    "we recognize two regimes of galaxy growth .",
    "for @xmath51:20 we confirm the inside - out growth , as discussed by @xcite , whereas for @xmath51:40 galaxies tend to form outside - in , meaning that the mass is accreted in the core of the primary galaxy rather than accreted on the outside .",
    "this change in behavior is caused by the self - interactions of minor galaxies for mass ratios @xmath8 .",
    "recently @xcite studied the size increase from major mergers down to 1:10 minor mergers .",
    "their results are consistent with our findings for comparable simulation parameters .",
    "the major difference between @xcite and the results presented here are the details regarding the orbital parameters of the merging galaxies ; they drop their minor galaxies in one - by - one , whereas we initialize all galaxies in a spherical distribution at the start of the simulation . as a consequence in some of our simulations the merging process with many minor mergers",
    "is not completed by @xmath9gyr . while the results of our 1:1 to 1:10 mergers are consistent with the growth observed in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , they are inconsistent with @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can not be the steeper density slope of the stellar bulge , as was suggested by @xcite , because we tried even higher density slopes for the minor child galaxies and found that this does not affect the growth of the merger product ( see appendix[sect : app : density ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between our results and those of @xcite could be explained by the averaging of the simulation results , as was also suggested by @xcite .",
    "to perform the simulations we use an updated version of the gravitational @xmath3-body tree - code bonsai @xcite .",
    "all simulations are performed on workstations with nvidia gtx480 graphical processing units .",
    "simulations are run with 1 to 18 gpus , depending on @xmath3 .",
    "the code has three important parameters ; the choice of the time step @xmath10 , the softening length @xmath11 and the tree - code opening angle @xmath12 .",
    "the opening angle is set to @xmath13 whereby we use the minimum distance opening criterion @xcite , which is computationally more expensive than the improved barnes - hut method @xcite by about a factor of two , but offers better accuracy @xcite .    after having fixed @xmath12 ,",
    "the choice of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are quite critical for the quality of our results .",
    "we measure the quality of the simulation based on the error in the energy and the change in size of a galaxy model in isolation .",
    "we determine the optimal values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 by performing an analysis in which we run a series of models using a range of values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . although the time step and softening are discussed extensively in previous literature ( e.g. @xcite ) we chose to do extra tests our - self .",
    "this for a couple of reasons , first most of the previous discussed methods propose a softening that scales with the number of particles .",
    "however , we use different number of particles for the primary galaxy and child galaxies so we had to find a configuration that works for both .",
    "second , our tree - code uses an accurate multipole expansion , in combination with a opening angle criteria that is different from used in the previously mentioned papers . and finally we use two component models with power law density distributions while most examples in the previous mentioned papers are based on one component spherical plummer models .",
    "therefore we decided to rather empirically test how the softening and time - step affected the properties of our initial conditions instead of taking over a previously result obtained in a different setting .",
    "the initial conditions for these isolated galaxies are generated using galactics @xcite and consist of a dark matter halo and a baryonic bulge .",
    "all models represent elliptical e0 galaxies .",
    "the bulges are modeled with a sersic index of 3 and the dark - matter halo is represented by an nfw profile @xcite .    in our simulations",
    "we collide the primary galaxy with a number of child galaxies , which are smaller and less massive .",
    "the mass ratio and the number of child galaxies which interact with the primary is one of the free parameters in our simulations .",
    "we generate the child galaxies using galactics by adopting the appropriate mass and size of the dark - matter halo both of which we assume to be a constant factor smaller than in the primary galaxy .",
    "this factor is equal to the mass ratio of the child , e.g. for a 1:10 child the mass and cut - off radius is 10 times lower than that of the primary galaxy . as a consequence",
    "the density of the child galaxy is smaller by a factor @xmath1410 than that of the primary . in appendix[sect : app : density ] we demonstrate that the effect of our selected size and mass ( and consequently density ) of the child galaxy is not critical for our conclusions . in fig.[fig : isodensity ] we present the density profiles of the baryonic bulge and dark matter halo of our selected initial conditions at zero - age , at @xmath15gyr which is the moment we intend to use them for the merger simulations in  [ sect : initconditions ] , and at @xmath9gyr .",
    "it takes a few crossing times for the galaxies to relax after generation , therefore we first let them evolve for @xmath15gyr before we use them in a merger configuration .",
    "the differences in the density profile for the same component are hardly noticeable as a function of time . to prevent spurious mass segregation all particles in one simulation have the same mass .",
    "mass differences between galaxies and baryonic and dark matter particle distributions are created by using different amounts of particles for each galaxy and galaxy components ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : galprogen ] for details ) .",
    "the isolated galaxy simulations were performed for a galaxy with a total mass @xmath17 , and a half - mass radius of 1.36kpc .",
    "which we call the parent or primary galaxy and for each of the child galaxies .",
    "the child galaxies have a mass that is @xmath18 times lower than that of the primary .",
    "for example the @xmath21:10 child has a mass of @xmath19 .",
    "to make sure that the child galaxies consist of enough particles to be accurately resolved and stay stable in isolation we use different resolution models for the initial conditions .",
    "depending on the number of child galaxies ( mass ratio ) used .",
    "we found that using a minimum number of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 particles for the bulge ( dark matter ) component proofed to be enough to keep the galaxies stable ( tab .",
    "[ tab : galprogen ] ) .",
    "we refer to low - resolution simulations ( lr ) for those in which the primary galaxy was modeled with @xmath22 and the 1:10 child with @xmath23 . for the high - resolution ( hr ) simulations we adopted @xmath24 and @xmath22 for the primary and 1:10 child galaxies , respectively .",
    "the child galaxies with a different mass ratio are scaled in a similar way as the 1:10 child , namely the number of particles of the primary divided by the mass ratio .",
    "each model was run for 10gyr . in figs.[fig : isotimesofthrmain ] and [ fig : isotimesofthrchild ] we present the results of the hr simulations ; the error in the energy @xmath25 for the left - hand panels and the expansion factor of the bulge , @xmath26(t ) , in isolation in the right - hand panels .",
    "@xmath27[eq : expansionfactor ] here @xmath28 is the half - mass radius of the baryonic component of the galaxy at time @xmath29 . in fig.[fig : isotimesofthrmain ] we present the result for the primaries , and fig.[fig : isotimesofthrchild ] for the 1:10 children",
    ".            as expected , @xmath30 decreases for decreasing @xmath10 and increasing @xmath11 , for the primary as well as for the child galaxy . the growth in size of the galaxies becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "however , for @xmath11 this is not a trivial matter . for too large a softening the galaxy tends to expand substantially , but the effect is not as dramatic as for a too small value of @xmath11 .",
    "the growth for large @xmath11 is caused by spurious suppression of relaxation in the large @xmath11 runs .",
    "the growth for small @xmath11 is numerical , caused by strong encounters which are not resolved accurately in our simulation .",
    "this limitation in our numerical solver is also noticeable in the energy error for small @xmath11 ( see figs.[fig : isotimesofthrmain ] and fig.[fig : isotimesofthrchild ] ) .    because we intend to study the expansion of the primary galaxies caused by mergers they should not expand in isolation . for our production simulations ( see  [ sect : initconditions ] ) we select the @xmath11 which show the least expansion when the galaxy is run in isolation . the time step is chosen as large as possible ( for performance ) but giving the smallest possible energy error .",
    "we make the choice of @xmath10 and @xmath11 based on the simulations for the primary galaxy , which for the child also turns out to be the bests choice . for the hr simulations @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and for the lr simulations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "using these settings the energy error of all the merger simulations stays below @xmath35 .",
    "these parameters are presented in dimension - less @xmath3-body units @xcite , but in physical units they translate to a time step of @xmath36myr for the lr and @xmath37myr for the hr simulations , and a softening length of @xmath38pc , and @xmath39pc for the lr and hr runs , respectively .    comparing the most optimal settings with the results of previous work on softening values @xcite .",
    "the chosen softening values are comparable to the values advised in @xcite and @xcite with our chosen values being slightly larger to keep the energy error less than @xmath40 while the size growth stays smaller than 10% .",
    "the difference between our results and @xcite is somewhat larger , but still within a factor of three .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the fact that we use more particles and use a tree - code instead of direct summation ( see also table 1 . of @xcite ) .",
    "most of the expansion of our galaxies occurs in the first few 100myr of the simulation , and therefore all galaxies are evolved to an age of 1gyr in isolation before they are used as initial galaxies in the merger simulations .    as as extra test we ran several of the isolated galaxies using the direct @xmath3-body code phigrape @xcite to confirm that the observed @xmath30 and expansion are not the result of using an approximation based simulation code .",
    "the results of these simulations are consistent with the results of bonsai , but show a @xmath30 of @xmath41 , because of the higher accuracy of phigrape",
    ".    with this choice of initial conditions , the child galaxies in the low resolution simulations still expand by at most a factor of 2 before the merger starts .",
    "to check how this affects our results we redo the simulation but at the start the child galaxies are represented as point masses .",
    "the point mass is replaced by a child galaxy as soon as it enters the dark matter halo of the primary galaxy .",
    "this simulation gives a nearly identical expansion of the primary galaxy to that in which the child was resolved from the start of the simulation .",
    "with the new child galaxies in place we selected one of the 1:10 @xmath42kpc merger configurations and ran this realization with the new child galaxies .",
    "each model is evolved for 10gyr using high resolution ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the effect of the child density on the size growth of the merger remnant is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitycheckradius ] , where we show @xmath44 as a function of time .",
    "the standard and compact configurations show similar evolution .",
    "the supercompact configuration shows a different behaviour during the first 5gyr of the simulation .",
    "this is an artifact of the way we determine the size of the merger remnant which does not work perfect in this particular configuration ( see  [ sect : results ] ) .",
    "the compactness of the galaxies causes the cumulative mass - profile to be irregular compared to the simulations with less dense child galaxies . as a consequence we are not always able to correctly measure the position in the profile that indicates the end of the merger remnant .",
    "after 5gyr the procedure works correct , because at this point the child galaxies have been involved in so many interactions that the mass - profile is smooth again .",
    "when the method starts working again we notice that all three simulations show similar size growth , independent of their density .",
    "the circular velocity of the standard and high density child simulations is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitycheckcircvelocity ] ( top ) we notice that the density of the child galaxy does affect the results .",
    "the simulation with the most dense child galaxies ( striped line with stars ) has a circular velocity similar to that of the isolated galaxy ( thick solid line ) .",
    "the compact configuration has a circular velocity that is @xmath14 100 km / s lower than the supercompact configuration .",
    "the standard configuration has a circular velocity in between the results of the compact and supercompact models .",
    "there is no clear trend in the effect the child density has on the circular velocity .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in the cumulative mass distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : densitycheckcircvelocity ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the difference between the runs is caused by the changed merger history . even though the configurations are based on identical plummer realisations",
    "the difference in density causes the merger history to be altered .",
    "tidal stripping has less effect on the more compact galaxies when they move through the dark - matter halo of the primary than it has on the standard galaxy .",
    "instead the higher density causes these galaxies to stay tightly bound resulting in interactions between other children and the core of the primary galaxy . because of these interactions some of the child galaxies will be flung from the galaxy during the first passage instead of merging with the primary .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitycheckraddistr ] we present the distribution of accreted material throughout the merger remnant . in this figure",
    "we notice large differences between the different configurations caused by the differences in child density .",
    "the solid line represents the standard simulation where the mass is accreted on the outside of the primary ( outside - in formation ) . for the denser children",
    "the mass is accreted closer to the core of the primary galaxy .",
    "this is the result of the less effective tidal - stripping described in the previous  .",
    "the dense child galaxies are able to progress further to the core of the merger remnant before they break up and are accreted . while the standard galaxies loose much of their material outside the core .",
    "this effect is best indicated by the supercompact configuration . in the merger remnant of this simulation",
    "most of the mass in the inner 8kpc originates from the child galaxies . while in the other configurations",
    "most of the mass in this inner part of the merger remnant originates from the primary .    concluding we can say that the density has no effect on the size of the merger remnant , but it does have an effect on how the remnant is build - up . with either mass being accreted on the outskirts ( low density children ) or in the inner parts of the merger remnant ( high density children )"
