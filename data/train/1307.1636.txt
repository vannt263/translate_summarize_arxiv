    "geometrical frustration has become a central challenge in contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "it is the source of many exotic ground states whose description remains challenging for both theoreticians and experimentalists @xcite .",
    "these unconventional magnetic states often originate from the strong degeneracy of the ground state manifold , which prevents the stabilization of standard magnetic phases .",
    "whatever their type , perturbations are often driving the low temperature behaviors by lifting partially or totally this extensive degeneracy .",
    "quantum or thermal fluctuations may also enter into play to select and stabilize a particular configuration ( or a subset of configurations ) , a phenomenon called `` order by disorder '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "the family of pyrochlore compounds r@xmath0t@xmath0o@xmath1 ( r is a rare earth and t = ti , sn , zr , ... ) , with the rare - earth magnetic moments localized at the vertices of corner - sharing tetrahedra are model systems to study these subtle order by disorder effects @xcite .    the case of r = er compounds is of specific interest : they present a strong xy - like anisotropy , combined with antiferromagnetic interactions leading to a model with an extensive classical degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the easy magnetic planes are perpendicular to the local @xmath3 ternary axes ( xy character ) , arising from the crystal field properties of the kramers er@xmath2 ion .",
    "while no signature of long - range order could be detected down to 100 mk in er@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 undergoes a transition towards an antiferromagnetic nel phase below @xmath4  k @xcite .",
    "this ordered phase has a non - collinear structure , in which the magnetic moments are perpendicular to the local @xmath3 axes in a peculiar configuration denoted @xmath5 @xcite . in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "this structure is surprising since dipolar interactions , which are an important perturbation to the isotropic exchange hamiltonian , are expected to select other magnetic states , called palmer - chalker states @xcite .",
    "however , by considering general anisotropic exchange parameters , it has been recently argued that a quantum order by disorder mechanism @xcite explains this @xmath5 ordering and accounts for many experimental features . in this context , the reasons for the absence of ordering in er@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 remain an open question .    in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by determining experimentally the key parameters of the hamiltonian of er@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 : the crystal electric field ( cef ) parameters obtained from inelastic neutron scattering experiments and the anisotropic exchange parameters deduced from the magnetization curves .",
    "the main difference between the titanate and stannate parameters is a weaker and less anisotropic exchange tensor . by analyzing neutron scattering data",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of short - range correlated domains frozen in the palmer - chalker configurations @xcite , hence quite different from the @xmath5 configuration selected in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "our magnetization measurements first confirm the absence of transition towards a long range ordered state down to 100 mk .",
    "the dc susceptibility keeps increasing with decreasing temperature .",
    "it presents an upturn below about 2 k , hence deviating from a curie - weiss behavior ( see the top inset of figure [ figxt ] ) , in agreement with ref . .",
    "below 200 mk , a freezing is observed , as shown by an irreversibility in the zero field cooled - field cooled ( zfc - fc ) magnetization and by a frequency dependence in the ac susceptibility ( see top figure [ figxt ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath15 exhibits a peak whose frequency dependence can be accounted for by an arrhenius law @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 s and @xmath19 k ( see bottom figure [ figxt ] ) in the measured frequency range ( 0.57 - 211 hz ) .",
    "qualitatively similar features have been observed in this temperature range in other spin - liquid compounds such as gd@xmath23ga@xmath24o@xmath25 @xcite or tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . at the moment , no clear picture emerges to explain this freezing , but it could be associated with slow dynamics of correlated spins .    the magnetization curves as a function of field present an inflection point around 1 t for temperatures below 750 mk ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the field induced transition observed in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , thus suggesting that a field induced order might be stabilized above this field in er@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the powder nature of the sample prevents from a detailed analysis of this metamagnetic like behavior .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that preliminary calculations ( using the mean - field model developed in section [ discussion ] ) indicate that reorientations of the magnetic moments occur in the 1 - 1.5 t field range for the three main symmetry directions [ 110 ] , [ 100 ] and [ 111 ] .    below 200 mk",
