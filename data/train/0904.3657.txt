    "there are over two hundred supernova remnants ( snrs ) identified in the galaxy @xcite . but",
    "current catalogues of snrs are incomplete , not only due to selection effects , but also because some snrs have been mis - identified in the past , when only limited quality observations were available . as an example , @xcite have recently discussed the nature of ( 350.1)-(0.3 ) .",
    "this radio source in the galactic plane had been included in catalogues of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) ",

    "@xcite have presented new observations of ( 350.1)-(0.3 ) , including absorption observations which show it is galactic , and conclude that it is after all a young and luminous snr ( although its structure is unusual compared with other galactic snrs ) .    prompted by this re - assessment , i present here a discussion of another extended galactic radio source , ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) ,",
    "which was included in early snr catalogues , but was then removed following its identification as a thermal source . since ( 35.6)-(0.4 )",
    "is included in the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps , @xcite ) , which has a resolution of 1  arcmin , it is now possible to better define its extent and morphology . knowing ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) s extent , it is also possible to determine its radio spectrum from available radio surveys that have lower resolution than the vgps .",

    "i present and discuss the available radio and infrared survey observations of ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) , and conclude that it is indeed a snr , not an region .",
    "( 35.6)-(0.4 ) is galactic radio source detected in several early radio surveys , and listed as a snr in several early catalogues .",
    "the extent of the source was given as @xmath3  arcmin , although this was not well defined by the available observations , as they had resolutions of only about 7  arcmin at best .",
    "subsequent radio observations , with somewhat better resolution , provide contradictory information about this source . both and @xcite derive non - thermal spectral indices for this source , and",
    "consequently identify it as a snr .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine accurate flux densities for this source , since it lies on a ridge of emission linking it to a brighter region of thermal radio emission ( 35.5)-(0.0 ) ( see below ) .",
    "it is also difficult to compare flux densities derived from surveys with different resolutions when the extent of the source is not well known . on the other hand @xcite  in a study of ` observations of radio sources formerly considered as possible supernova remnants ' ",
    "derive a flat radio spectral index of @xmath4 ( using the convention that flux density scale with frequency as @xmath5 ) from 408-mhz and 5-ghz observations with similar resolution ( @xmath6 and @xmath7  arcmin respectively ) .",
    "they regarded ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) as an region , not a snr , and argue that the available upper limit in radio recombination lines ( rrls ) did not preclude an region identification .",

    "they also found faint polarisation towards it at 5  ghz , but noted that it was not clear if this was associated with the source , or from the galactic background . more recently @xcite report a rrl line detection towards @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and consequently this source  labelled ( 35.6)-(0.5 ) ",
    "was included as an region in later studies , e.g.@xcite , who made a marginal detection of absorption towards it .",
    "( 35.6)-(0.5 ) is also discussed by @xcite , who describe it as an snr region complex , based on @xcite s reported rrl detection , and report of non - thermal emission . @xcite present some further rrl detections towards both ( 35.6)-(0.5 ) and ( 35.5)-(0.0 ) , and propose an association between the supposed snr in the region and the rather old pulsar psr 1855@xmath1202 .",

    "the contour levels in this figure have been chosen so that optically thin thermal emission with @xmath19 appears the same at each frequency ( i.e.  the spacing between the contours in brightness temperature is scaled by @xmath20 ) .",

    "in contrast , the emission from ( 35.5)-(0.0 ) is consistent with thermal emission .",
    "the non - thermal spectrum of the emission from ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) is supported by comparison with other single - dish survey data with lower resolution that are available electronically , namely the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey and the parkes 5.0-ghz survey @xcite .    the flux density of ( 35.6)-(0.4 )",

    "polygons were drawn around ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) , a tilted plane was fitted to the edges of the polygons and then removed from the image , with the remaining emission within the polygon integrated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is subjective in that the results depend on the exact choice of polygon used . in this case",
    "the full - resolution vgps image was used to define the polygons , bearing in mind the lower resolution of the 10-ghz nobeyama .",

    "these give a spectral index of @xmath23 for the radio emission from ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) .",

    "however , the detection of rrl from this source by @xcite and @xcite , implies that there is some thermal emission towards this region .",
    "but , as noted above , there are indeed two compact iras sources within or near ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) , with the pn iras 18554@xmath120203 being close to the positions where rrls have been detected .    the vgps observations ( fig .",
    "[ f : vgps ] ) , show that ( 35.6)-(0.4 ) has a partially limb - brightened structure  i.e.  it is a ` shell ' remnant  but with differing radii in different directions , which is reminiscent of the snr ( 166.0)+(4.3 ) ( @xmath25vro 42.05.01 ) , see @xcite .",
