    "dramatic changes in the spectra of ultracool dwarfs with @xmath12 k lead to their classification as a distinct spectral type , the l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the l dwarf field population is a mix of old hydrogen - burning stars and young brown dwarfs .",
    "the weakening of molecular features and reddening of broad - band colors compared to m dwarfs are explained by the formation of condensates , or dust grains ( see the review by ) .",
    "early observations established that chromospheric activity weakens in this spectral type range @xcite , and it is now clear that magnetic activity changes dramatically in character ( see @xcite ) .",
    "l0-l2 dwarfs are cooler than the m dwarfs which show optical variations due to cool magnetic starspots @xcite , but warmer than the l / t transition brown dwarfs that show mounting evidence of infrared variations due to cloud inhomogeneties @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that l dwarfs may show variability due to changes in the condensate distribution ( such as clouds , or holes in cloud decks ) and/or magnetic starspots .",
    "because measurements of @xmath6 suggest all l dwarfs are rapid rotators @xcite , rotational modulation is expected to have periods of hours .",
    "optical ( @xmath13-band ) variations have been detected in many l dwarfs at the few percent level and usually attributed to inhomogenities in the clouds .",
    "although a few detected @xmath13-band signals were periodic and consistent with rotational modulation , others were not , and characteristics seen in one observing run may be different in another . suggested that surface features in early l dwarfs evolve on timescales of hours and  mask \" the underlying rotation curve in @xmath13-band : a particularly interesting case was ( hereafter 2m1145 + 23 ) , an l1.5 dwarf with h@xmath0 emission @xcite , which showed periods that did not match the previous year s observations .",
    "@xcite found that at least seven , and perhaps up to twelve , of eighteen l dwarfs were variable at @xmath13-band , but that most had non - periodic light - curves .",
    "the two observed periods were thought to be much longer than the rotation rates .",
    "@xcite reported that the l0 dwarf had a consistent 2.4 hour period over three nights , but the amplitude declined from 27 to 11 mmag . both and @xcite considered the balance of evidence favored cloud variations over sunspot - like starspots , although some possible starspots have been noted in l dwarfs with h@xmath0 emission .",
    "@xcite suggests that a three - hour periodicity in the l3.5 is due to starspots : although this source is not chromospherically active , it is radio active @xcite .",
    "these observations are all of field l dwarfs ; @xcite did not find statistically significant variations in young ( @xmath14   ori ) early l - type brown dwarfs , but few percent variations would have been below the detection threshold and warmer young brown dwarfs showed evidence of accretion .",
    "flares are another potential type of variability in ultra cool dwarfs , but only a few optical flares in l dwarfs have been reported @xcite . as @xcite remark , only the h@xmath0 emission line has been seen in these flares , and not the nearby helium emission lines seen in m dwarf flares , though this may be a matter of sensitivity . in a study of m8-l3 dwarfs",
    ", @xcite placed a limit of @xmath15 hr@xmath8 on the rate of flares that increase the h@xmath0 line more than a factor of a few above the quiescent chromospheric emission level .",
    "this rate is consistent with the estimated l dwarf flare duty cycle of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "more strong flares have been observed in m7-m9 dwarfs , with other atomic emission lines and even white light continuum emission in some cases .",
    "their h@xmath0 flare duty cycle is also much higher , perhaps 5 - 7% @xcite .",
    "notably , simultaneous radio - optical monitoring of two m8.5 dwarfs found no temporal correlation between radio flares and h@xmath0 flares @xcite .",
    "the field l dwarf observations are intriguing , but the limitations of telescope scheduling and ground - based observing make it difficult to reliably characterize l dwarf variability and assess the relative contribution of periodic and non - periodic components .",
    "the discovery of ( hereafter w1906 + 40 , @xcite ) , a nearby l1 dwarf in the kepler mission @xcite field of view , has allowed us to obtain a 15 month long time series from space .",
    "although w1906 + 40 is much fainter ( sdss @xmath17 ) than the typical fgkm main sequence star targeted with kepler , the achieved precision of 7 mmags per observation compares favorably with ground - based data .",
    "we report on the kepler photometry and supporting multi - wavelength observations in section  [ da ] , discuss periodicity in section  [ sec - period ] , and discuss flares in section  [ sec - flare ] .",
    "w1906 + 40 was observed with kepler director s discretionary time ( program go30101 ) from 28 june 2011 to 27 june 2012 and with guest observer time ( program go40004 ) from 28 june 2012 to 03 october 2012 .",
    "its parameters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it was assigned a new name for each quarter : kic 100003560 ( quarter 10 ) , kic 100003605 ( quarter 11 ) , kic 100003905 ( quarter 12 ) , kic 100004035 ( quarter 13 ) , and kic 100004076 ( quarter 14 ) .",
    "the target was observed in long cadence mode @xcite , providing 30 minute observations , for the full time period and also in one - minute short cadence mode @xcite during quarter 14 . for each observation ,",
    "the kepler pipeline @xcite provides the pixel data , the time ( @xmath18 , or mission days ) , the aperture flux ( sap_flux ) , the uncertainty , and a corrected aperture flux ( pdcsap_flux ) , which is meant to correct instrumental drifts @xcite . after excluding data flagged as bad ( quality flag @xmath19 )",
    ", there are 18,372 long cadence measurements .",
    "the pipeline - estimated noise levels are 0.5% .",
    "the spacecraft is rotated between quarters and the focus is a compromise , so w1906 + 40 was observed on four different detectors with considerably different point spread functions .",
    "the kepler pipeline therefore selects different apertures for each quarter , which in some cases we can improve upon . for quarters 10 and 14",
    ", we adopt the pdcsap_flux photometry , which used an aperture of nine pixels , because we found no significant improvement with smaller apertures . however , the default pipeline analysis used larger apertures for quarters 11 - 13 , which resulted in noisier photometry than quarters 10 and 14 . furthermore , quarter 13 s pdcsap_flux is very low ( @xmath20 counts per second ) , which we found is due to two negative ( bad ) pixels included in the aperture .",
    "smaller apertures also reduce the possibility of contamination by nearby background stars .",
    "we therefore adopted smaller apertures of six pixels for quarters 11 and 12 and four pixels for quarter 13 using the pyke tool kepextract .",
    "instrumental drifts for these three quarters were removed with third - order polynomial fits .",
    "kepler photometry is not calibrated in any absolute sense since such calibration is not needed to meet the primary mission goals , so we divided each quarter s data by the median count rate for that quarter .",
    "the kepler data show a strong peak in the periodogram at a period of 0.3702 days .",
    "we emphasize that this period is present in each quarter , and in both the pipeline photometry and our revised ( smaller aperture ) photometry .",
    "this 8.9 hour period is consistent with the rotation period distribution deduced for early l dwarfs by their @xmath6 measurements @xcite .",
    "we fit a sine curve to all five quarters of long cadence data with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis and find the period is @xmath21 days with an amplitude of @xmath22 ( 8.3 mmag ) .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation is twice this ( 1.5% , or 16 mmag ) .",
    "fitting each quarter separately , then averaging , yields a period of @xmath23 days with a standard deviation of @xmath24 days .",
    "the full phased dataset with sine curve is shown in figure  [ fig - phased ] . excluding the small number of outliers , whose nature are discussed in section  [ sec - flare ] , the standard deviation about the fit is 0.65% , or 7 mmag .",
    "we adopt this as the noise level of the measurements , as it is only a slight increase over the expected value ( 0.5% ) and there are other possible noise sources in the kepler instrument @xcite , though real intrinsic variations may contribute .",
    "figure  [ fig - radioregion ] shows four days of kepler data as an example of unphased data including a possible flare ( section  [ sec - kepflare ] ) ; our radio observations ( section  [ sec - radio ] ) were in this time period .",
    "the kepler filter response curve is shown in figure  [ fig - filter ] along with the estimated relative count rate at each wavelength due to the l1 dwarf photosphere ; possible contributions from flares are discussed in section  [ sec - kepflare ] .",
    "w1906 + 40 was observed with the gemini multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the gemini north telescope ( program gn-2012a - q-37 ) .",
    "the r831 grating , og515 order blocking filter , and 1.0 arcsecond slit were used to yield wavelength coverage 6276  to 8393  , with two small gaps between detectors that were interpolated over .",
    "we obtained sixteen 600-second exposures on ut date 24 july 2012 , twenty - five on 29 july 2012 , and six on 8 august 2012 .",
    "the flux calibration star bd+28 4211 was observed on 29 july 2012 .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , wavelength - calibrated , extracted and flux - calibrated in the standard way using the gemini gmos package in iraf . a small correction",
    "was then applied to bring the spectra in agreement with the @xmath25-band magnitude .",
    "we compared the gemini spectra to the spectral type standards defined by @xcite and find that w1906 + 40 is spectral type l1 ( figure  [ fig - spectrum1 ] . )",
    "it is not a low gravity l dwarf @xcite .",
    "we see no evidence for lithium absorption in any of the spectra .",
    "the l1 optical spectral type agrees with the l1 near - infrared spectral type derived in the discovery report .",
    "h@xmath0 is variable on all nights but detected in emission in all spectra .",
    "on 24 july the h@xmath0 emission equivalent width increased from 0.5   at the beginning of observations to 7.5   at the end . on 29 july 2012 , the h@xmath0",
    "emission begins at 2.8 , but is then dominated by flares , discussed further in section  [ geminiflare ] , as seen in figure  [ fig - spectrum1 ] . on 8 august ,",
    "the first five spectra have an equivalent width of 2.5 - 3.0  , but the last increases to 6.5 .",
    "the average non - flare h@xmath0 equivalent width is 4 .",
    "the flares on 29 july overwhelm the small periodic signal , so we defer any attempt to identify small photospheric changes on the other nights to a future paper when additional simultaneous ground - based and kepler data are available .",
    "w1906 + 40 was observed in clear and dry conditions on 10 september 2011 ( ut ) with the keck ii nirspec near - infrared echelle spectrograph ( mclean et al .",

    "w1906 + 40 is just the sixth l / t dwarf detected in quiescent radio emission @xcite .",
    "the w1906 + 40 discovery paper was based on the preliminary wide field infrared explorer ( wise , @xcite ) data release .",
    "it appears as source wise j190648.47 + 401106.8 in the final wise all - sky source catalog .",

    "we find that in the wise all - sky single exposure ( l1b ) source table and wise preliminary post - cryo single exposure ( l1b ) source tables , w1 is consistent between and within the two epochs , but the source apparently brightened from w2@xmath64 in april 2010 to a mean w2@xmath65 in october ( with individual uncertainties @xmath66 magnitudes . ) the october data also shows more scatter in w2 than expected , but higher precision mid - infrared observations would be needed to confirm variability .",
    "the wise data are more than 680 periods before the beginning of the kepler data .",
    "the radius and inclination of w1906 + 40 are important parameters in interpreting the kepler light curve .",
    "we can constrain them both using our observations . first",
    ", the radius is a function of the observed distance ( and thereby the luminosity ) and our effective temperature fit :    @xmath67    the uncertainty of 3% includes the uncertainty in the bolometric correction and photometry but not parallax or temperature uncertainty .",
    "second , assuming the photometric period is the rotation period , we can also constrain the radius and inclination with our spectroscopic @xmath6 :    @xmath68    the uncertainty in this value is 20% due to the @xmath6 uncertainty . combining this constraint with equation  [ eqn - radius2 ]",
    "suggests @xmath69 , but a range of inclinations are possible .",
    "since the period is so strongly constrained , we can infer the posterior probability using three observations for the data ( luminosity , effective temperature , and @xmath6 ) and a three parameter model ( luminosity , radius , and @xmath70 ) .",
    "our priors are flat in luminosity and radius , but proportional to @xmath70 on geometric grounds . using an mcmc chain of one million steps , and discarding a burn - in of one thousand steps ,",
    "we find the posterior probability distribution shown in figure  [ fig - lprob ] . the inferred radius is @xmath71 . at the 95% confidence level , we find that @xmath72 , with the median value @xmath73 and most likely value @xmath74 .",
    "the inferred radius is consistent with theoretical predictions of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the most striking aspect of the kepler light curve is that it has a consistent phase for over a year .",
    "furthermore , while we can not rule out deviations from a sine function or small changes in the shape , it appears that the light curve has no flat portion .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the rotating dwarf has a single feature ( darker or brighter than the surrounding photosphere ) that is always in view . to explore this possibility , we model the first year of data using the circular spot equations of @xcite , which we implemented in python with an mcmc code .",
    "we assumed linear limb darkening coefficients of 0.9 based on the predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many solutions are possible , and generally we can find single dark spot models with @xmath43 similar to the sine models .",
    "some possible solutions with completely dark spots with @xmath70 consistent with figure  [ fig - lprob ] and are listed in table  [ tab - spot ] .",
    "solutions with @xmath76 can be found , but they require a larger spot . the different light curve during quarter 13 could be explained in large part in the single circular dark spot model by increasing the spot size ( to @xmath77 for @xmath78 ) , or by lowering the latitude ( to @xmath79 for @xmath78 ) .",
    "while attributing a long - lived feature to a single  spot \" is attractive , it could also be modeled in other ways , such as multiple large dark spots at lower latitudes .",
    "an intriguing alternative spot model that does not favor large circumpolar spots was presented for active dwarfs by @xcite . in this",
    " zonal model , \" it is assumed that a large number of small spots together form large dark bands symmetric around the equator .",
    "this naturally produces sinusoidal light curve even at @xmath80 without requiring us to be viewing polar spots .    the physical cause of the putative large spot at high latitude ( or even multiple spots at low latitudes )",
    "might be a magnetic starspot ( i.e. , a region of cooler photosphere due to magnetic fields ) or an cloud structure .",
    "jupiter s great red spot would produce a strong periodic signal at 9.9 hours even in unresolved data @xcite , though a single spot on w1906 + 40 would be at much higher latitude .",
    "@xcite comment that small holes in a cloud layer would form bright ( @xmath13-band ) spots  similar to the ` 5 @xmath29 m hot spots ' of jupiter .",
    "\" these might be distributed according to the zonal model .",
    "@xcite argue for a  magnetically - driven auroral process \" to produce optical variations in some ultra cool dwarfs .",
    "we can not determine whether the features are brighter or darker than the photosphere with the single - band kepler data , so all of these possibilities are plausible .",
    "it is worth considering whether chromospheric emission line variations would explain the kepler periods .",
    "varying h@xmath0 emission from zero to ten angstroms equivalent width , even with associated bluer balmer lines , would only produce a signal of @xmath81% , an order of magnitude too small to explain our data .",
    "the stability of the period and amplitude makes a striking contrast with the l dwarf observations discussed in the introduction .",
    "besides the stable 8.9 hour period , we find no evidence of other periods , transient or not , in the data .",
    "to search for other periods of hours to days , we have calculated periodograms for every three , five , and ten day period and found no other significant period in any of them .",
    "the long - term drifts we removed were typically 1% , and only reached 6% during quarter 11 , and these are consistent with the drifts in bright stars corrected by the pdc pipeline process .",
    "although intrinsic slow changes in w1906 + 40 on timescales of months might be removed , it is likely that a strong signal , like the @xmath82 day period m dwarf ( kic 414293 , @xcite ) , would still be detected .",
    "variations on timescales less than a week that are @xmath83 would be detected .",
    "we conclude that the various  masking \" periods and non - periodic variations reported in other l dwarfs at amplitudes @xmath84 , and attributed to condensate cloud inhomogeneties , are not present in w1906 + 40 . on the other hand , variations @xmath85",
    "can be plausibly be attributed to noise , but could also be due to real variations .",
    "( the data shown in figure  [ fig - radioregion ] are suggestive , and typical . )",
    "if the short - lived variability observed on non - active ultracool dwarfs is associated with condensate clouds , perhaps the long - lived periodic feature on this active l dwarf is associated with different , possibly magnetic , phenomena . a number of studies @xcite have suggested that some ultracool dwarfs have stable magnetic large - scale topologies , like dipoles or quadrupoles .",
    "this could result in a large high - latitude feature .",
    "@xcite reviewed starspot lifetimes : while starspots on single , young main - sequence stars have typical lifetimes of a month , other types of starspots can have lifetimes of years or decades .",
    "furthermore , an active longitude may remain more heavily spotted for years , even as individual spots come and go on shorter timescales .",
    "of course , as @xcite remark , a cooler starspot on an l dwarf might have different cloud properties than the normal photosphere .",
    "after the first forty minutes of gemini data on 29 july 2012 show relatively quiescent h@xmath0 emission , the subsequent spectra are dominated by a series of flares characterized by strong emission lines and a blue continuum .",
    "the first flare is in the ten minute exposure beginning at ut 08:29:28 , followed by a more powerful",
    " main \" flare at ut 10:14:15 ( shown in figure  [ fig - spectrum1 ] .",

    "the gemini observations were originally queue scheduled as three blocks of three hours each , with two blocks on 29 july 2012 .",
    "the main flare begins in the 15th spectrum , the last of the first block .",
    "there is then a five minute gap before the next block of spectra begins .",
    "after eight of these spectra , the telescope was diverted to a target of opportunity for another program .",
    "after slightly more than one hour , the queue returned to our program to take two more spectra .",
    "the lost observing time was made up on 8 august .",
    "the kepler light curve stops due to a monthly data download . ]",
    "the kepler light curve is in good agreement with the appearance of the spectroscopic white light continuum .",
    "even with multi wavelength data at high time resolution ( see @xcite ) , flare spectra have proven to be challenging to interpret .",
    "most notably , this l1 dwarf is able to produce a white light flare that is similar to that observed in m dwarf flare stars .",
    "indeed , the flare spectrum is very similar to @xcite s flare in the m6 dwarf ( wolf 359 ) , including the white light , broad h@xmath0 , and atomic emission lines .",
    "the flare also resembles the most powerful observed flares in m7 @xcite and m9 @xcite dwarfs , demonstrating continuity in the flare properties across the m / l transition .",
    "the white light and emission line light curves are qualitatively very similar to the 28 march 1984 ad leo flare described by @xcite as  impulsive / gradual . \"",
    "the main ( 1304.9395 ) flare shows both atomic emission lines and continuum emission with a blue slope .",
    "the higher time resolution photometry shows that the flare began four minutes into the gemini ut 10:14:15 exposure , and reached its kepler maximum in the final two minutes .",
    "the  white light \" flare continuum spectrum is consistent with an @xmath86k blackbody . in @xcite s radiative hydrodynamic simulations , an electron beam injected at the top of a magnetic loop heats the chromosphere , producing emission lines in general agreement with observed flares , but does not penetrate to the denser photosphere , and white light emission is not produced . as @xcite discuss in the case of a flare on the m4.5 dwarf , evidently the w1906 + 40 photosphere must somehow be heated to produce @xmath87k continuum emission .",
    "this is also seen in the older models of @xcite , where white light continuum emission requires moving the temperature minimum deeper and heating the photosphere ( see their models 4 - 6 ) . free - free emission from a hot ( @xmath88 k ) plasma is also consistent with our white light flare spectrum but is disfavored by @xcite s analysis of m dwarf flares .",
    "the kepler photometry and our calibration ( section  [ sec - kepflare ] , table  [ tab - calib ] ) indicates that the total ( included extrapolated to ultraviolet ) flare energy release during the gemini 10:14:15ut exposure was @xmath89 erg .",
    "the photometric light curve is typical of those observed in uv ceti ( m dwarf ) flare stars as summarized by @xcite : it is asymmetric , with a rapid rise , an initial fast decrease , and a subsequent slow decay which began when the flare was at @xmath90 of the maximum .",
    "the flare lasts 106 minutes in the kepler photometry .",
    "using the calibration discussed in detail in section  [ sec - kepflare ] , the observed flare energy through the kepler filter during this time is @xmath91 ergs , which may be extrapolated to @xmath10 erg for the full ultraviolet / optical range .",
    "the white light in the main flare is accompanied by strong , very broad h@xmath0 emission , especially evident in the top spectrum of figure  [ fig - flarespectra ] .",
    "most stellar flares do not show much h@xmath0 broadening @xcite .",
    "if modeled with two gaussians , as sometimes done for m dwarf flares @xcite , the narrower gaussian component has full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath92    and the broader gaussian component has fwhm @xmath93  .",
    "very broad h@xmath94 and bluer balmer flare lines are usually attributed to stark broadening , but @xcite argued in the case of a flare that broad h@xmath0 is better explained by turbulent motions . @xcite also interpret broad h@xmath0 flare emission in the m6 dwarf as due to turbulent motions , in addition to stark broadening , possibly due to  a chromospheric prominence that is lifted during the flare onset and then raining down during the decay phase . \"",
    "( their observations have higher time and spectral resolution . )",
    "this interpretation could also be applied to the w1906 + 40 flare .",
    "@xcite noted broad ( fwhm 12  ) h@xmath0 emission from the kernels of a great solar flare ; these are also responsible for the white light emission and show turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling should be pursued , however , as very broad h@xmath0 emission wings are caused by stark broadening in some @xcite models along with the white light ( models 5 , 6 ) , while @xcite found broad h@xmath0 _ absorption _ associated with a white light flare on reminiscent of an a - star .",
    "as the blue continuum and broad h@xmath0 decays , the h@xmath0 line stays strong but narrows .",
    "atomic emission lines from ( 6678 , 7065 , 7281 ) and ( 7774 ) are easily visible .",
    "these emission lines remain strong for two hours ( figure  [ fig - flaretime ] ) .",
    "one hour after the main flare at mission times 1304.97 - 1304.99 , h@xmath0 strengthens again , perhaps due to another flare , creating a double peaked time series profile , though only a small increase in the spectroscopic blue continuum and kepler photometry occur . subtracting the quiescent photospheric spectrum",
    ", we also identify emission lines from neutral k and na which fill in the core of the photospheric absorption features .",
    "these spectra are similar to red m dwarf flare spectra @xcite , and are understood as the result of the increase in electron density and heating of the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the much longer duration of the emission lines is not surprising , and is consistent with solar flares @xcite and the statistics of sdss spectra of m dwarf flares @xcite .",
    "the flare luminosity for the first hundred minutes in units of @xmath95 ergs is 480 , 13 , and 3.5 in h@xmath0 , ( 6678  ) , and ( 7774 ) . during the time period covered by the first three gemini spectra ( figure  [ fig - flarespectra ] ,",
    "80% of the kepler luminosity was emitted but only 60% of the , 50% of the and 40% of the h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "the first ( 1304.8597 ) flare was also a powerful one in its own right .",
    "in the first gemini spectrum of the first flare , h@xmath0 strengthens to equivalent width 30 , which we can correct to 42   given the timing of the kepler photometry . in the next ten minute exposure , h@xmath0 has increased to 55 . when the quiescent photosphere is subtracted , a blue continuum is present in the first exposure and the flare is clearly detected in the kepler photometry .",
    "we are unable to say if this flare , which would otherwise be the strongest spectroscopically observed l dwarf flare , is a physically related to the main flare almost two hours ( a fifth of a rotation period ) later .",
    "overall , the complex time evolution , with the first flare two hours before and a secondary flare an hour after the main flare , suggests the emergence and reconfiguration of a complex , multi - loop magnetic structure .",
    "this may be consistent with the l dwarf flare theory sketched out by @xcite in which flux tubes generated in the warmer interior rise rapidly into the cooler atmosphere , but in any case the flares appear very similar to flares on hotter stars , suggesting similar mechanisms .",
    "although probable flares in early l dwarfs have been noted before @xcite , they were seen in the h@xmath0 line only .",
    "the 29 july flares are both stronger in h@xmath0 than in those flares , in addition to showing other atomic emission lines and white light .",
    "there are a total of 21 candidate white light flares in the quarter 14 short cadence data that peak at least 10% above the average w1906 + 40 count rate and are elevated for two or more measurements ( table  [ tab - flares14 ] ) .",
    "kepler time series photometry of these flares are shown in figure  [ fig - flarephotometry14 ] the strongest candidate flares include data points flagged as likely cosmic rays by the kepler pipeline , but we believe this is incorrect .",
    "the sharp rise of the two 29 july flares are also flagged as possible cosmic rays ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , but the gemini spectroscopy proves they are flares .",
    "the centroid of the main flare peak shifts by 0.4 pixels not because it is a off - center cosmic ray , but because the positions are wavelength dependent , and ( blue ) flare photons outnumber ( red ) photospheric photons more than three to one . as the flare decays the centroid returns to normal .",
    "we therefore accept flare - like light curves even if the sharp rise triggered the cosmic ray flag .",
    "it can be useful to discuss flares in terms of energies instead of relative counts .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have estimated the energy of white light flares on g , k and m dwarfs observed by kepler by approximating the flare as a 10,000k blackbody .",
    "the kepler mission filter is similar to @xmath96,@xmath97 , and @xmath25 combined @xcite : as illustrated in figure  [ fig - filter ] , the l dwarf photosphere contributes mainly at the very reddest wavelengths , but hot flares will contribute through the entire filter .",
    "indeed , the effective wavelength for the kepler photometry for w1906 + 40 is 7990  rather than @xmath98  for hot sources . in table",
    "[ tab - calib ] , we present energy calculations of hypothetical flares that have the same observed count rate as w1906 + 40 , assuming the flares radiate isotropically .",
    "we use the @xmath25 magnitude , the distance derived in section  [ optical ] , and the l1 dwarf spectrum shown in figure  [ fig - filter ] to estimate that the l dwarf luminosity is @xmath99 erg s@xmath8 in the wavelength range 4370  to 8360 .",
    "the blackbody energies for equal count rates , @xmath100 erg s@xmath8 , are 50% higher because the average energy per photon is larger .",
    "thus , to double the observed kepler count rate , one needs a flare of @xmath101 erg ( over that wavelength range ) during a short cadence exposure and @xmath102 erg during a long cadence exposure .",
    "most of the flare energy will be emitted at shorter optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the corresponding bolometric luminosities for the blackbodies are 4.4 to @xmath103 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "real flares are not blackbodies , so we also estimated the total luminosities by consulting table 6 of @xcite , which gives energies from 1200to 8045   for the impulsive and gradual phases of great flare of 12 april 1984 on .",
    "the results are close to the blackbody approximations .",
    "seven of the flares last at least an hour .",
    "most rise to their peak value within a few minutes , and drop to half their peak flux in 1 - 3 minutes .",
    "we list the rise time to the peak in table  [ tab - flares14 ] ) as @xmath104 , the time to drop to half the flux as @xmath105 , and the total length of the flare as @xmath106 .",
    "the flare at mission day 1298.5401 is an exception with , a 23 minute rise time and slow decay .",
    "overall , both the typical shape and the variety of the light curves is consistent with stellar flares @xcite .",
    "we also list the peak long cadence count rate in table  [ tab - flares14 ] ; most short cadence flares are enhancements of 2% or less in the 30 minute data and therefore would not be significant detections without the short - cadence data . the cosmic ray flagging may have a significant effect on real flares in the long cadence data : the long cadence flux for the gemini - confirmed 1304.9353 flare is half that we obtain by integrating the short cadence flux , and the discrepancy is due to the removal of  cosmic rays \" in the long cadence pipeline . we have searched the quarters 10 - 13 data for other candidate flares ; however , flares are easily confused with cosmic rays , and we have concluded that we can not reliably distinguish between flares and cosmic rays using the long cadence data .",
    "we nevertheless mention two interesting candidates . at mission time 1148.407",
    ", the target increases by 48% , decaying to 10% in the next exposure ; this would represent a flare of energy @xmath107 ergs .",
    "( this is the time period also plotted in figure  [ fig - radioregion ] . )",
    "these points are not flagged as cosmic rays and the pixel data appears consistent with the stellar psf , so it is likely to be a real flare .",
    "the most powerful long - cadence  only flare candidate is at mission time 1039.049 : w1906 + 40 nearly doubles in brightness , then decays over the next 2 hours back to the normal brightness . the pipeline , however , flags the initial increase as a possible cosmic ray strike , and if this is correct , the following  decay \" simply represents the return of the ccd s sensitivity to normal .",
    "flare rates should should be viewed with caution for the lowest energy flares , since the contribution of a long - lived tail can be lost in the noise , and flares with low peaks will be missed altogether even in the short cadence data .",
    "there is no apparent dependence of the flares on the rotation phase .",
    "it is also notable that four of the eight most powerful quarter 14 flares might be related , the pair 1304.8597/1304.9353 and the pair 1336.1666/1336.1939 .    in figure  [ fig - flarefrequency ] , we plot the flare energy spectrum @xcite as the estimated flare energy as a function of the cumulative frequency ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "additional monitoring would be needed to improve the frequency estimates and to check if the flare rate varies .",
    "comparison to well studied dme flare stars @xcite indicates the flare energy spectrum is similar to that observed in flare stars but shifted downwards for w1906 + 40 : flares are @xmath109 times less energetic at a given frequency , or alternatively flares of a given energy are less frequent on w1906 + 40 than on dme flare stars .",
    "on the other hand , the white light flare rate on w1906 + 40 is comparable to that of the sun @xcite , despite the l dwarf s much lower effective temperature and surface area .",
    "the observed rate for flares with energy @xmath110 ergs is @xmath111 to @xmath112 hr@xmath8 , or 1 - 2 per month . for comparison , the @xcite limit on h@xmath0-only",
    "l dwarf flares is a cumulative frequency of @xmath113 ; those flares are too weak to be detected in the broad kepler filter , because a change of 10  would change the photometry by only @xmath81% .",
    "our initial monitoring of w1906 + 40 has revealed long - lived surface features and a well - defined periodicity due to rotation . despite its cool photosphere ,",
    "this l1 dwarf maintains an active and variable chromosphere , emits in the radio , and produces powerful flares that rival white light flares in the sun .",
    "a major limiting factor in the analysis of the periodic component is our lack of knowledge of the spot - to - star flux ratio . during our guest observer cycle 4 program",
    ", we are monitoring w1906 + 40 with a number of ground - based telescopes to search for changes correlated with kepler data and to determine if the surface features change on multi - year timescales .",
    "these observations may be able to reveal the nature of the surface features , and whether they are hotter or cooler than the surrounding photosphere .",
