    "modulational instability ( mi ) is a nonlinear phenomenon causing a plane wave ( pw ) or long pulse to break up into smaller , finite sub - structures . it can happen in a plethora of different physical systems , ranging from deep water waves  @xcite to optical beams  @xcite . in particular , the mechanism of mi in optics , which may happen in both temporal  @xcite and spatial domains  @xcite , either independently or simultaneously , has been extensively studied due to its paramount implications on the dynamics of intense light beams or pulses traveling throughout nonlinear media . in brief , perturbations in the incoming optical field can be amplified upon propagation due to the nonlinear response of the optical medium  @xcite , leading to the reorganization of the energy and subsequent generation of finite optical beams or _",
    "filaments _ , randomly distributed along the space - time profile of the parent wave .",
    "regarding their effects , temporal mi of either continuous waves or very long pulses is responsible for the generation of ultrashort pulses  @xcite with temporal durations down to- or even below the single - cycle limit  @xcite .",
    "such mi - driven short pulses are linked to the appearance of spectral sidebands which , in combination with other nonlinear processes , can boost the generation of extremely broadband radiation . in contrast",
    ", spatial mi has been demonstrated to be , in general , an unwanted effect in the propagation of intense ultrashort pulses throughout bulk optical media .",
    "in fact , the mi - triggered redistribution of the energy along the transverse profile of the beams gives rise to the appearance of intense hot spots that could potentially damage the optical material itself ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "each intense spot contains an amount of power comparable to the critical power @xmath0 for self - focusing  @xcite .",
    "whilst such structures are doomed to undergo collapse due to self - focusing whenever their power @xmath1 in a kerr medium , they have been shown to form stable multidimensional solitary waves when traveling across optical media with competing cubic and quintic ( cq ) nonlinearities  @xcite , yielding in some cases to the formation of _ liquid light _",

    "the recent measurement of higher - order kerr ( hoke ) responses in air and its constituents  @xcite gave rise to an extensive , ongoing discussion on the physical origin and validity of such peculiar contribution to the nonlinear polarization  @xcite .",
    "among other reasons , such a debate has been specially motivated by the deep implications of the hoke response in the description of laser filamentation  @xcite and novel light distributions  @xcite . in particular , theoretical media displaying such kind of competing hoke terms have been shown to allow for a new branch of highly concentrated nonlinear solitary waves , called _ ultrasolitons _",

    "iii we will show that the new model explains the phenomenology reported in the literature for different kinds of nonlinear responses .",

    "such a system can be either a nonlinear optical medium in which @xmath5 would represent the scalar electric field envelope of an optical wave propagating along the @xmath6 direction  @xcite , or an ultracold atomic gas in which @xmath7 describes the order parameter of the corresponding macroscopic collective quantum state evolving in time @xmath8  @xcite .",

    "[ avstb ] . in order to reinforce this assertion ,",
    "we have carried out the same numerical simulations described above with pws featuring amplitudes @xmath166 and @xmath162 , whose results are also depicted in fig .",
    "[ avsta ] and fig .",
    "[ avstb ] , respectively .",
    "we observe that , as expected , the destabilization occurs earlier since , in this range , @xmath158 increases for larger amplitudes following eq .",
    "( [ gammamax_hoke ] ) . in light of the same procedure described in section iv - a above ,",
    "we have also numerically computed @xmath158 by fitting the exponential growth of the pw amplitude at the early stages of mi to eq . .",
    "the estimations of @xmath158 , as well as the characteristic size of the fastest growing filaments @xmath159 , are summarized in table 2 for different initial values of the pw amplitude .",
    "one can appreciate that the agreement between the analytical and numerical results is reasonable , even though there are small discrepancies inherent to the the fact that the first - order perturbation theory is only applicable when the amplitudes of the perturbations are very small .",
    "in this paper we have put forward a full analysis of the nonlinear process of modulational instability in systems described by nonlinear schrdinger equations with arbitrary instantaneous nonlinear responses . in particular",
    ", the proposed theoretical approach allows for a complete description of the multiple regimes of stability and instability of plane waves in systems involving competing higher - order kerr nonlinearities .",
    "all our analytical predictions for the stability domains , perturbation growth rates and characteristic filament sizes have been confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the evolution of unstable plane waves .",
    "this intriguing phenomenology could potentially be observed in a coherent atomic medium with a properly tailored nonlinear response .",
