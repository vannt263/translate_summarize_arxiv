    "the phenomenon of ghost condensate is an analogue of higgs mechanism for the condensation of scalar field with negative square of mass near zero values of field .",
    "this mechanism of ghost condensation usefully works in the case of expanding homogeneous universe , that has a specific reference frame with a selected temporal component in comparison with spatial ones .",
    "then , the scalar field with negative sign of kinetic term near zero values of kinetic energy in its action composed of invariant derivative terms @xmath22 , condenses at a nonzero value of @xmath23 , which represents a temporal component of 4-vector field .",
    "the ghost condensation removes the problem with negative kinetic energy , since near the condensate the fluctuations have correct sign of kinetic energy , of course .",
    "the studies @xcite show , that field @xmath23 should be constant due to the current evolution of universe , with a high accuracy .",
    "next , one could combine the ghost condensate with the global monopole , that produces a correct static spherically symmetric profile of mass distribution @xmath24 in the region of flat rotation curves due to the dark matter .",
    "therefore , one should suppose the presence of global monopole in the center of spiral galaxy , i.e. inside a supermassive black hole . at large distances , the monopole corresponds to the spatial component of vector field .",
    "then , one considers the background field @xmath25 at large distances ( perturbations become important at small distances , corresponding to inner edge of halo ) , where @xmath26 is the scale about the planck mass , while the ratio of @xmath27 determines the rotation velocity @xmath28 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "so , the ghost condensate in the presence of global monopole with account of higher derivative terms in the action can be represented by the constant 4-vector field @xmath29 relevant to the situation of both universe expansion and dark halo .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the light bending by the metric modelling the dark halo . in section 2",
    "we in detail calculate the deflection angle in the limit of ` infinite ' halo implying a negligible value of impact distance with respect to the halo size and compare the result with the deflection by a global monopole @xcite .",
    "then we determine the effective deflecting mass and find its difference by a factor of @xmath0 from the dark matter mass responsible for the flat rotation curves in contrast to naive expectations of their coincidence .",
    "further , we describe the geometry of deflection revealing properties consistent with astronomical observations . in section 3",
    "we calculate the deflection in the case of finite halo , that demonstrates a weak dependence on the impact distance slowly perturbing the geometry discussed in section 2 .",
    "the results are summarized in conclusion .",
    "by the hamilton  jacobi equation @xmath30 for an action @xmath31 of massless particle written in the form @xmath32 incorporating two integrals of motion in the spherically symmetric static gravitational field at fixed polar angle @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 is the conserved energy of particle and @xmath35 is its rotational momentum , which we put positive for definiteness , we deduce @xmath36 which results in @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an analogue of centripetal potential , @xmath39 thus , the quantity @xmath40 represents the action for the radial motion of particle in the gravitational field with account of energy due to the angular rotation .",
    "the trajectory is implicitly determined by the equations @xmath41 taking the derivative of ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) with respect to the time . ] , we get @xmath42 and , hence , @xmath43 relating the energy and rotational momentum .",
    "let us denote the ratio of two integrals by @xmath44 with the dimension of length , which we call as ` an impact distance ' , that becomes clear from fig .",
    "[ fall ] shown for the flat minkowskian space - time .     and circular velocity @xmath45.,width=302 ]    at the trajectory given by ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) we get @xmath46 where the negative sign corresponds to the branch of trajectory for the particle arriving from infinity , while the positive sign does to the branch for the particle departing to infinity .",
    "denote the solution of @xmath47 by @xmath48 . at this value",
    "the radial velocity @xmath49 becomes equal to zero ( the denominator in eq.([rd ] ) vanishes ) , that corresponds to returning point .",
    "so , the light ray approaches the gravitating object from the infinity , while it reaches the distance @xmath48 , after that the ray moves off the object .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath48 denotes the minimal distance between the light trajectory and the gravitational lens .",
    "then , the overall change of @xmath50 for the particle is given by @xmath51 if we put the size of halo @xmath52 much greater than the impact distance : @xmath53 , that corresponds to the limit of infinitely large halo .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we expect that this limit is relevant to actual astronomical observations .",
    "let us integrate out ( [ delta - t ] ) by expanding in small parameter of @xmath16 .",
    "so , with the accuracy up to the first order we get @xmath54 @xmath55 that allows us to write down @xmath56 where the leading term @xmath57 after the substitution @xmath58 is reduced to @xmath59 which corresponds to the straightforward motion with no deflection .",
    "the contribution @xmath60 originates from the factor of @xmath61 in the integrand of ( [ delta - t ] ) , so that @xmath62 the expansion of @xmath63 results in @xmath64 where we have neglected the deviation of @xmath65 from unit @xmath66 analogously , the expansion of @xmath67 produces @xmath68 summing up ( [ t2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ t3 ] ) gives @xmath69 the integral is easily calculated by parts @xmath70 so that @xmath71 thus , the deflection of light is determined by the angle @xmath72 note , this limit of deflection angle is independent of impact distance .",
    "this result is similar to the calculation of light deflection by the global monopole metric in @xcite , where the radial component @xmath73 can be taken in the same form , while the temporal component of metric is constant , @xmath74 , which corresponds to the term of @xmath75 in calculations above .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that _ the deflection angle in the metric of global monopole is twice less than the calculated value of _ @xmath76 .",
    "the bending angle derived is in agreement with results of @xcite , where the deflection due to the dark matter with a significant pressure was calculated numerically at various equation of state parameters @xmath77 , and the limit of pressureless matter was mentioned , too .",
    "the same result could be extracted from @xcite by calculating the limit of @xmath16 at infinitely small impact distances from analytical expressions in @xcite also discussed in section 3 .",
    "the main feature of deflection angle under study is its independence of impact distance .",
    "such the deflection can be ascribed to an effective dark matter mass .",
    "indeed , let us compare the effect with the deflection by a nonrelativistic spherical mass distribution described by the schwarzschild metric : @xmath78 putting @xmath79 we derive the expression for the effective dark matter mass responsible for the deflection @xmath80 which _ linearly depends on the distance_. compare it with the dark matter mass responsible for the centripetal acceleration in the region of flat rotational curves , @xmath81 therefore , in the metric under consideration the effective deflecting mass of dark matter is factor @xmath0 greater than the dark matter mass producing flat rotational curves in newtonian limit .",
    "the same conclusion is drawn from virial estimates of dark matter mass in galaxy clusters , where we get the relation @xmath82 since the average kinetic energy of @xmath83 galaxies with average masses @xmath84 at @xmath85 @xmath86 is related with the average potential energy of galaxies posed at average distance @xmath87 @xmath88 by the virial theorem @xmath89 both estimates produce the similar linear dependence of dark matter mass versus the distance , as we retrieve from the gravitational lensing .",
    "remarkably , astronomical observations of galaxy clusters give @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass of luminous baryonic matter in the clusters . note , that the mass of luminous matter is related with the velocity of rotation in spiral galaxies at distances of flat rotational curves by the empirical tully ",
    "fisher scaling law @xmath92 which is natural , if one suggests the existence of universal critical milgrom acceleration @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a characteristic distance for a galaxy , where the dominance of baryonic matter in the gravitation comes to competition with the dark matter contribution becoming dominant at larger distances .",
    "the value of @xmath94 is close to the visible size of galaxy , i.e. it is the characteristic size of baryon distribution in the galaxy .",
    "so , let us compare the masses of luminous and dark matters : @xmath95 where @xmath52 is the size of dark halo .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath96 i.e. the dark halo spreads far away from the visible size of luminous object .",
    "this point supports the relevance of considering the limit of infinite halo in the problem of gravitational lensing at realistic impact distances about the visible size of lens .",
    "thus , the vector field model of dark matter qualitatively reproduces both dark matter effects for astronomical objects : the flat rotational curves and light bending .",
    "the numerical effect on about 50%-difference between the effective deflecting mass and dark matter gravitational mass in rotational curves could probably be used in future for falsifying the model , though such a combination of astronomical data seems to be quite exclusive .",
    "another aspect of comparing the rotation curve picture in a galaxy with the gravitational lensing by the same galaxy has been recently considered in @xcite , where the potentials responsible for the rotation and lensing have been introduced .",
    "the difference between the potentials would signalize on a non - zeroth pressure of dark matter . in the case under study",
    "these potentials coincide , so the lensing of dark mass distribution could be evaluated by standard techniques for the cold pressureless matter . in contrast to the potentials , we operate by the effective deflecting mass allowing us to compare it with the mass one could expect from the rotation velocity .",
    "this could be important for a treatment of some misalignment between the lensing mass and dark matter mass in astronomical measurements of x - band lenses @xcite .",
    "let us consider the geometric aspects of gravitational lensing . in fig .",
    "[ bending ] , point @xmath31 denotes a star , which light reaches an observer posed in point @xmath97 by path @xmath98 curved by dark matter object somewhere placed at interval @xmath99 . since all of angles are extremely small , while distances between the observer , dark matter object and star are astronomically large , we can perform calculations in the first order versus angles . then , the distance between the deflection point and position of dark matter object projected to the line between the observer and star @xmath100 ( see fig . [ bending ] )",
    "equals @xmath101 points @xmath102 and @xmath103 coincide because @xmath104 is negligible .",
    "the angle of deflection @xmath105 is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath106 therefore , @xmath107 the same deflection takes place by the path in the upper half of plane shown in fig .",
    "[ bending ] .",
    "( 120,60 ) ( 0,0 )            thus , the angle between two images of star is given by @xmath108 this geometry can be easily applied to draw samples of gravitational lensing in the model with constant @xmath105 .",
    "[ bend ] represents the gravitational magnifying of linear image at @xmath109 , @xmath110 and small angles .",
    "the picture illustrates the characteristic distortion caused by such lenses . for simplicity of picturing , in figs .",
    "3 - 6 we put the parameter @xmath111 in order to enlarge the visual effect . nevertheless , in practice , an angular magnification of real astronomical facilities is sufficiently large for the observation of gravitational lensing by the dark matter ( see numerical estimates in the end of section )",
    ".    one can easily recognize basic features of deflection and distortion :    1 .",
    "the dark matter object is posed in the center of inversion symmetry .",
    "2 .   hence",
    ", the angle distances between the points inside two images coincide .",
    "( if one displaces the star image by angle @xmath112 , then the second image is displayed to the same angle increment @xmath112 . )",
    "3 .   therefore ,",
    "small radial widths of images are coincide , while the radial sizes are proportional .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality @xmath113 is equal to the ratio of angle fractions given by division of @xmath114 by the center of symmetry , i.e. the dark matter object .",
    "this point is shown in fig .",
    "[ bend6 ] .",
    "4 .   then , the ratio of surface areas is equal to @xmath113 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bend2 ] for the distortion of circle object .",
    "+     thus , for the model of gravitational lensing , we arrive to the following conclusion :    the relative values of surface brightness for two images of lensed small object is given the inverse ratio of angle fractions , @xmath113 , or visible impact parameters .",
    "so , the ordinary picture of gravitational lensing due to the dark matter modelled by the vector field is shown in fig .",
    "[ bend5 ] .",
    "we have taken two galaxies as elliptic figures at different distances ( @xmath109 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .",
    "their images are narrow arcs surrounding the dark matter object , that is generically similar to the real astronomical picture inserted as illustration .",

    "then , @xmath120 such the value is consistent with astronomical observations of gravitational lensing , where the characteristic angle sizes between the dark matter object and image of lensed luminous object is about 1 arcsec .",
    "if the impact distance is comparable with the size of dark halo , then one has to take into account the halo edge at @xmath121 ( see fig . [ edge ] ) .",
    "so , the formulae exploited above give the angle increment in the halo , @xmath122 with @xmath123 .    .",

    "[ match ] .",
    "the fracture disappears at @xmath144 .",
    "however , such the redefinition of parameter @xmath124 , removing the fracture of bending curve ( the derivative of @xmath145 with respect to @xmath140 becomes a continuous curve ) , results in a discontinuity of metric coefficient @xmath73 at the edge of halo , that is absolutely unacceptable .",
    "the origin of singularity in eq.([dt / dz ] ) is the specific dependence of halo metric - coefficient @xmath146 on the distance @xmath3 .",
    "so , it produces a slow deflection with negative sign in vicinity of halo edge ( @xmath147 ) , i.e. there is a small repulsive component of force acting to the light ray in comparison with the case of point - like mass .",
    "it is clearly seen in derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ t3 ] ) and ( [ t23 ] ) .",
    "then , the attraction by the halo near the edge is small in comparison with the case of point - like mass , hence , the substitution of trajectory passing the halo instead of the same path in the field of point - like mass results in an essentially smaller deflection , and we even get the fracture of curve for the bending angle , while the deflection increases when the path in the halo becomes longer . thus , the fracture is the direct consequence of metric , specified for the dark halo .",
    "moreover , one could speak about a gravitational refraction of light on the border of two media with different metrics ( in the case under study , we get the transition from the vacuum to the halo medium ) .",
    "the analysis shows that in quite a wide region of impact factors , the deflection by the dark halo with the edge is slowly perturbed due to the edge : the dependence on the impact distance is weak in comparison with the rapid change in the case of point - like mass .",
    "so , the picture of deflection considered in section 2 qualitatively remains the same .",

    "the difference is twofold .",
    "first , the metric coefficient @xmath146 in @xcite has been taken in the form @xmath148 second , the deflection by the schwarzschild metric calculated by expanding in powers of inverse distance has been written in a form , which is literally different , but in fact it should coincides with the formula ( [ d - sc ] ) with the accuracy up to @xmath149 .",
    "these facts allow us to make a direct comparison in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "so , we find that our result is consistent with the corresponding limit of expression in @xcite with the accuracy mentioned above . in part , the limit of infinite halo @xmath150 in @xcite , reproduces the value of @xmath151 , which is actually in the evident contradiction with the main result of @xcite shown graphically as the function of @xmath140 ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , instead of @xmath152 one could observe a number , which is factor @xmath153 greater .",
    "the same factor remains , when we compare the complete curve in @xcite : the deflection angle of dark halo with the edge is multiplied by @xmath153 .",
    "literally , the curve of @xcite could be reproduced from our _ right _ curve in fig .",
    "[ match ] multiplied by @xmath153 , that gives the correct value for the bending by the schwarzschild metric , but it misleads on the deflection by the halo .",
    "the factor @xmath153 removes the fracture point from the curve , of course , as it is clearly seen in fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "thus , our analysis on the deflection angle by the dark halo with edge is consistent with the formal limit of expressions in @xcite , but we disagree with the numerical in - figure - shown result of @xcite .    [",
    "[ an - inner - edge . ] ] an inner edge .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have considered the external edge of halo at large distances .",
    "however , the luminous matter essentially contributes to the deflection at short impact distances , where the gravitational field is dominantly determined by distributions of stars and gas .",
    "so , there is the inner edge of halo .",
    "this problem has been comprehensively investigated in terms of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "recently , bekenstein formulated a consistent relativistic theory of gravitation including gravitational scalar and vector fields in addition to the ordinary tensor of metric @xcite , so that it incorporates general mond effects originated from the introduction of critical acceleration @xmath154 .",
    "the authors of @xcite have found the same value of deflection for the case of infinite halo at impact parameters greater than the inner edge , that corresponds to the isothermal halo of circular velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the comparison with observational data has been performed , so that the conclusion drawn is the following : mond is not in conflict with the data on the gravitational lensing .",
    "then , the analysis of @xcite supports the model considered in this paper , which includes general features of mond , too .",
    "briefly summarizing the consideration , we have described the deflection of light by the dark mater halo modelled by the constant 4-vector field , in detail .",
    "the analytical results are in agreement with the limit of small velocity of rotation @xmath155 in previous studies .",
    "the deflection angle for the infinite halo is twice of the value for the global monopole .",
    "the effective lensing mass is factor @xmath0 greater than the dark matter mass at the same distance . for the typical rotation velocity in spiral galaxies , the characteristic value of deflection angle is about several arcseconds , that is consistent with values observed astronomically .",
    "the relative surface brightness of two images of lensed object is determined by the inverse ratio of impact angles with respect to the dark lens .",
    "the effect of halo edge is reduced to slow dependence of deflection angle on the impact distance , that weakly perturbs the gravitational lensing .    in conclusion",
    ", we have to make several important comments :    first , it would be wrong to identify the model of halo accepted in the paper with known model of isothermal halo .",
    "such the opinion could not be correct because of the following reasons :    * the physics of vector field model in the paper and the physics of general isothermal model are certainly different . *",
    "the vector field model of dark matter includes inner and outer edges , so that between the edges the metric is described by the same metric as for the isothermal halo .",
    "hence , the deflection at impact distances greater than the radius of inner edge and much less that the radius of outer edge coincides with the result of isothermal halo . that is a new statement for the limit of infinite halo in the vector field model with different physics .",
    "the final equation for the deflection is known @xcite , but the physical motivation is different .",
    "for instance , the model does not contain the singularity of isothermal halo ( that is quite evident ) .",
    "so , the identification with the singular isothermal halo looks misleading . *",
    "the effects related with the inner edge absent in the case of isothermal halo were investigated in the literature @xcite . *",
    "the effects related with the outer edge absent in the case of isothermal halo as was represented in the literature @xcite , contain some errors , i.e. the presence of fracture point in the bending curve at the edge was missed .",
    "the representation of correction in the paper has required further application of method , which gives the correct result for the infinite halo , that has been usefully made in the initial part of section 2 .",
    "thus , the paper describes the physics different from the singular isothermal halo .",
    "the results concerning the limit of infinite halo in the vector field model and the effects of outer edge of halo are new .",
    "second , we have to emphasize that the reason for the difference between the effective mass deflecting the light at the impact distance @xmath3 and the dark matter mass inside the same radius @xmath3 by a factor found in the paper is quite clear : the deflection takes place due to the mass inside the radius @xmath3 and effectively due to the dark matter mass outside the same radius .",
    "this reason is evident and transparent .",
