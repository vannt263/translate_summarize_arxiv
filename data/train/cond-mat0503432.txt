    "it is commonly known that solids undergo phase transitions ( first order , second order ) with changing temperature , characterized by a critical temperature @xmath7 depending on the system ( melting temperature , curie ( neel ) temperature ( magnetic , ferroelectric systems ) , superconducting transition temperature , etc . ) .",
    "the temperature behaviour of real solids is , however , very often much more complicated .",
    "there exist in reality many other anomalies such as structural transformations , metastable or  exotic  phases , changes between different phases ( metallic - nonmetallic and vice versa , transitions between different magnetic or ferroelectric phases , etc . ) .",
    "this very complicated picture of the transitions in real solids is due to a great variety of different interaction processes in the coupled ionic and electronic subsystems resulting in a variety of the observed properties of solids . to each such a transition",
    "can usually be attributed a characteristic temperature or characteristic temperature range where a transition begins and ends .",
    "this paper is devoted to a general problem how to detect experimentally all critical and characteristic temperatures of solids taking as an example polycrystalline , ferromagnetic @xmath0 material and applying here three independent experimental methods .",
    "a @xmath0 ingot was prepared by a melting of the constituent metals on a water - cooled copper hearth in a high purity argon atmosphere .",
    "the sample was remelted several times to promote homogeneity .",
    "the phase purity of the @xmath0 compound was ascertained by means of the x - ray debye - scherer diffraction with @xmath11 radiation using a siemens d-5000 diffractometer . the intermetallic @xmath0 sample , prepared in this way , is polycristalline , metallic , ferromagnet with curie temperature @xmath7 of about @xmath12 @xmath2 ( see e.g. refs [ 1]-[6 ] ) and this kind of the prepared sample is especially suitable for our experiments .",
    "except the ferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath7 we can expect many other low energetic transformation processes such as small displacements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions within the unit cell , as well as , small relative movements of the grain boundaries and domain structure with changing temperature what should be reflected in our measurements indicating the existence of the characteristic temperatures connected with these transformations . to investigate the properties of this sample we apply a nonconventional method of the indirect measurement of the chemical potential as function of temperature ( the galvanic cell method ) , surface potential barrier method ( measurement of the current flow vs temperature through the @xmath0-_polymer - metal _ sandwich ) and we perform the measurement of the temperature dependence of the resistivity ( cf also ref .",
    "it should be stressed at this place that the galvanic cell method and the surface potential barrier method were applied for the first time to this material in the present paper .",
    "all three independent measurements , applied to the same polycristalline @xmath0 sample , reveal plenty of characteristic temperatures , connected with mentioned transformation processes , as well as , the curie temperature connected with the magnetic phase transition of the system . the use of three independent methods was absolutely necessary to confirm the existence of the observed characteristic temperatures as a physical reality and not as artifacts or measurement errors . taking into account that each particular , experimental method possesses its own characteristic sensitivity the agreement between characteristic temperatures obtained from three independent measurements is quite good .",
    "it , however , means that the characteristic temperatures connected with different phase transformations ( transitions ) can successfully be detected with the use of these methods with sufficient accuracy .",
    "one of the methods applied in this paper is based on the fact that the chemical potential of the system can  see  both critical and characteristic temperatures of solids .",
    "first observations of this kind were made for superconductors , refs [ 7]-[16 ] , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "further theoretical investigations , refs [ 17]-[24 ] , revealed that the temperature dependence of the chemical potential shows kinks for critical and characteristic temperatures also in the case of magnetic and structural transitions for both normal and fluctuating valence systems . in the case of alloys , when a transition appears for a critical concentration , the chemical potential can also  see  this transition , too ( cf refs [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] ) . as a generalization of these results it was suggested that the chemical potential should experimentally be used to detect all transitions and transformations possible to occur in real solids with changing temperature or concentration ( see refs [ 18]-24 ] ) .",
    "the realization of this idea is , however , not an easy problem and therefore only a few experimental measurements have been performed but all of them support this general idea . in refs",
    "[ 12]-[14 ] , [ 16 ] the chemical potential as function of temperature has been measured for superconductors with the use of the work function method . additionally , in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] has been found that the chemical potential can also  see  the magnetic transitions in thin films when apply external magnetic field .",
    "recently , in refs [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , a quite new approach for the indirect measurement of the chemical potential of metallic samples has been proposed with the use of a simple electrochemical experiment , utilising a galvanic cell .",
    "one of the electrodes of this cell was the investigated metallic sample and the other one the reference electrode . according to the nernst s formula ( cf e.g. ref .",
    "[ 27 ] ) the difference of the chemical potentials of the electrodes is given by the expression    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a constant and @xmath17 is the measured voltage . by changing the temperature of the electrolyte bath",
    "the voltage as function of temperature can be plotted , giving us indirectly the relative chemical potential temperature dependence .",
    "using as an electrode investigated magnetic samples @xmath13 , @xmath18 ( see ref . [ 25 ] ) and @xmath19 ( see ref . [ 26 ] ) it was possible to identify the critical temperatures of these materials directly from the temperature dependence of the voltage in agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "thus , the method can visualize magnetic phase transitions taking place in the investigated cell electrode by changing the temperature of the electrolyte bath . in the case of @xmath20 material",
    "[ 26 ] ) it was also possible to detect a characteristic temperature @xmath21 connected with the inhomogeneity of the measured sample .",
    "this method applied to the shape memory alloys @xmath22 ( 10% of deformation ) in ref . [ 25 ] and @xmath22 ( 15% of deformation ) in ref .",
    "[ 26 ] revealed plenty of characteristic temperatures connected with structural transformations ( begin and the end of each transformation ) in agreement with the known experimental results .",
    "the same can be said about @xmath23-alloy sample ( see ref . [ 26 ] ) where the temperature of the structural transformation was easy to identify and its value was equal to the value known independently from another experiment . in other words",
    "the method works and indicates all possible critical and characteristic temperatures of the measured system .",
    "the only problem is how to overcome a relatively narrow temperature range available for the experiment ( electrolyte ) and how to adopt the method to non - metallic samples .",
    "the situation can , however , rapidly be changed in the nearest future due to new investigations .    in the case of the @xmath0 sample with relatively high curie temperature a special electrochemical cell with ionic",
    "liquid was designed :    @xmath24    @xmath25 @xmath26    where @xmath27 is ethylammonium chloride and @xmath28 is diethylammonium chloride . the mixture of both organic salts and cobalt chloride yields electrolyte , liquid above 71 c ( 344 k ) and therefore it is possible to perform the experiment to temperatures higher than the curie temperature of the sample ( @xmath29 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the reference electrode was silver - silver chloride ( 2% ) inside of the same organic melting alkalammonium chloride , separated with a glass frit from the electrolyte .",
    "it was established that the resulting @xmath30 changes of the galvanic cell ( 2 ) do not depend on the use of the reference electrode .",
    "the @xmath30 depends , however , on the reactivity of the @xmath31 ion in the electrode material and therefore it is sensitive to the chemical potential changes due to the phase transition at @xmath32 and another transformations .",
    "the temperature sensor , used in the experiment , was pt-100 .",
    "the @xmath30 of the cell and the temperature were recorded with the use of the multichannel electrochemical set emu ( elchema , wroclaw , poland ) connected with pc .",
    "the investigated @xmath0 sample was soldered with indium to copper wire and insulated with epoxy resin in such a way that only the measured sample had contact with the electrolyte .",
    "heating and cooling curves of the @xmath30 as function of temperature were recorded .",
    "the temperature scan was about 2 degrees / minute .",
    "the results of the measurements can be seen in fig .",
    "1 ( heating ) and in fig .",
    "2 ( cooling ) . the curve in fig .",
    "1 , showing the temperature dependence of the @xmath33 of the galvanic cell , is not smooth .",
    "it visualizes many characteristing temperatures ( denoted by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , .. , @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the melting temperature of the electrolyte and @xmath7 is the curie temperature ) .",
    "all of them correspond either to a local minimum ( maximum ) or to a change in slope of the @xmath30 curve .",
    "such characteristic points in the @xmath30 curve always signalize that the measured system undergoes a transformation ( transition ) at these points ( cf refs [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] ) .",
    "at the first glance , the characteristic temperatures may look like artifacts or measurement errors .",
    "it is , however , absolutely not the case because the appearance of these points strongly confirm our further measurements .",
    "these points make an evidence that with increasing temperature many different processes inside of the sample take place ( as mentioned above ) , including also the magnetic phase transition at @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "a real material transforms itself with increasing temperature and certainly such a feature holds for another materials , too , more or less .",
    "surprisingly , in fig .",
    "1 we can easily find a point corresponding to the melting temperature of the electrolyte @xmath38 @xmath39 and below this temperature we can find such characteristic temperatures as @xmath40 , confirmed also in our resistivity experiment ( see later ) .",
    "in other words the galvanic cell seems to work in a temperature range which is lying below the melting point of the electrolyte . in contrary to fig .",
    "1 , the curve of the @xmath30 vs temperature presented in fig . 2 ( cooling ) , is much more smooth and only several characteric temperatures @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath36 ( a little shifted ) can easily be identified together with the curie temperature @xmath7 , as well as , the melting temperature of the electrolyte @xmath37 when compare their values with the values presented in fig .",
    "this was certainly caused by irreversible reorientation processes in the @xmath0 sample after performed heating up to temperatures higher than the curie temperature .",
    "a more detailed discussion of all characteristic temperatures in connection with the results of two further measurements will be presented in sect .",
    "several years ago a new experimental technique to study phase transitions in metals has been found , called surface potential barrier method .",
    "this technique has successfully been applied to study melting - crystallization processes of low temperature melting metals like @xmath45 , @xmath46 and wood alloy ( cf ref . [ 28 ] ) . later on the method was utilized to investigate structural transformations in nanostructured metals subjected by a severe plastic deformations in @xmath47 ( see ref . [ 29 ] ) , @xmath48 ( see ref . [ 30 ] ) and in the shape memory alloys @xmath22 ( cf ref . [ 31 ] ) .",
    "the method works in the following way .",
    "a tunnel transparent potential barrier between an investigated metal ( @xmath49 ) and a probe material ( @xmath50 ) can easily be formed due to an extreely narrow conduction band ( conduction level ) lying between the valence and conduction band of the @xmath50 material .",
    "thus , under applied voltage , the maximum of the current flow through the barrier can be reached in the case when the fermi levels of @xmath49 and @xmath50 coincide . in the region of temperatures where @xmath49 exhibits a phase transition that energy balance",
    "is broken due to a small shift of the @xmath49 fermi level .",
    "this , however , leads to an exponential change in the tunnel current flowing through the barrier which can be detected ( cf ref . [ 32 ] ) as an evidence for a phase transition ( transformation ) . in other words",
    ", the method uses also the fact that the chemical potential ( fermi level in metals )  feels  the phase transition ( transformation ) , similarly to the galvanic cell method , described above . as a @xmath50 material",
    "an electroactive polymer was used .    to realize the surface potential barrier",
    "an experimental cell has been made in the form of a multilayer sandwich type metal - polymer - metal structure .",
    "one of the metals in the cell was the investigated metal ( @xmath49 ) , exhibiting a phase transition ( transformation ) lying within the studied temperature interval .",
    "the other one , such a reference metal ( @xmath51 ) has been chosen which does not exhibit a phase transition ( transformation ) in the investigated temperature range . a polymer film , lying between @xmath49 and @xmath51 , was made by a spin coating technique of the polymer solution applied to the polished @xmath49 surface .",
    "the @xmath51 material was subsequently evaporated onto the free polymer surface .    as a @xmath50 polymer the poly(phthalidilidenebyphenililene ) material ( @xmath52 ) was used , similarly to the ref . [ 33 ] .",
    "the following reasons justify this choice .",
    "first , the polymer possesses very good film forming properties on metallic substrates and as it was shown in ref .",
    "[ 34 ] in certain conditions @xmath53 forms solid homogeneous films ( 0.005 - 10 @xmath54 thick ) .",
    "second , the @xmath55 material does not change the properties till the softening temperature ( about @xmath56 @xmath2 in vacuum ) .",
    "third , the high conductive properties of this polymer has been confirmed by an extensive study , performed in ref . [ 35 ] .",
    "the polymer films of 0.9 @xmath54 thickness were used in the experiment .",
    "the quality of the polymer films was controlled by the scanning probe microscopy method , ref .",
    "the sandwich with @xmath57 structure was placed into a thermostat which was able to change the temperature within prescribed range of 300 - 475 @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature was varied with a velocity from 4 to 27 degrees / minute .",
    "the precision of the temperature measurement was 0.5 @xmath2 .",
    "the sample was connected to the electrical circuit which is typically used for non - linear elements with @xmath58-shape negative differential resistance ( see ref . [ 37 ] ) .",
    "a current source was used as a power supply .",
    "the current flowing through the sandwich has not exceeded the value of 50 @xmath59 .",
    "the precision of the current measurement was 5% .",
    "the voltage drop on the sandwich was normally from 1 @xmath60 to 5 @xmath61 .    to produce extremally narrow conduction band lying within the gap between the valence and conduction band of the @xmath52 polymer",
    "the following procedure has been applied .",
    "the high conducting state of the @xmath50 layer was induced by the unuaxial pressure which was applied to the multilayer sandwich type @xmath62 structure . in fig .",
    "3 we show the conductivity dependence of the @xmath63 vs applied pressure .",
    "it can be seen that the initial conductivity was small and when the pressure reached a certain value , @xmath64 , the conductivity started to increase and reached a relatively high value typical for the metallic state and possessed metal - like temperature dependence down to 1 @xmath2 ( cf ref . [ 38 ] ) .",
    "the current - voltage ( @xmath65 ) characteristics of such a multilayer structure ( sandwich ) is presented in fig .",
    "this characteristics is typical for systems with tunnel potential barrier .",
    "an analogical procedure was also used to produce a tunnel barrier in the metal-@xmath52 system to obtain a josephson junction , ref . [ 39 ] . the energetic diagram for the @xmath66 interface",
    "is presented as a result of the narrow conduction band forming in the polymer with a tunnel potential barrier within the contact area ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the temperature dependence of the current flowing through the @xmath67 sandwich .",
    "five specific temperature regions can be distinguished in this dependence .",
    "the first one corresponds to the low conducting state of the system and observed up to @xmath68=339 @xmath2 .",
    "in this temperature range the signal is to small to detect phase transformations .",
    "the current starts to increase at above 339 @xmath2 and this is the beginning of the second region where a growth of the current fluctuations is observed . in average , both the current values and current fluctuation amplitudes change a little up to about 375 @xmath2 .    a next step in the current flow",
    "was observed beneath 380 @xmath2 .",
    "this step corresponds to the third teperature region .",
    "the average current amplitudes and fluctuations in the third region are approximately two times greater than in the second region .",
    "third and fifth region in fig .",
    "6 are separated by a narrow temperature range ( 5 @xmath2 ) of abnormally big fluctuations ( fourth region ) with increasing amplitudes and frequency fluctations till the boundary of the fifth region is reached at approximately 410 @xmath2 ( curie temperature ) .",
    "the current reaches its maximum value in the fifth region and the fluctuations disappear . under cooling",
    "the current fluctuations in the sandwich appear below 400 @xmath2 and current drops to a very small value . as a rule ,",
    "the temperature of the drop is less than the curie temperature of about 2 - 5 @xmath2 .",
    "this histeresis may be connected with irreversible reorientation processes of the polycristalline sample accompanied by the change in its magnetic structure ( domain structure ) after previously performed heating .",
    "another types of peculiarities in the current behaviour with decreasing temperature were not observed .",
    "we see that the value of the critical temperature @xmath7 of the magnetic phase transition in the @xmath0 sample , observed with the use of the surface potential barrier method , agrees pretty well with the existing experimental data ( cf refs [ 1]-[6 ] ) and the value obtained from fig .",
    "it is also important to stress that the characteristic temperatures @xmath8 are visible in fig .",
    "6 , similarly to presented in fig . 1",
    ", while the others ( @xmath69 ) are hidden in the very small values of the current signal in the first region ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . within the third region in fig .",
    "6 the characteristic temperatures @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( not resolved in fig . 1 ) are quite good visible in agreement with the resistvity measurements , presented in fig . 8 .    within the framework of the potential barrier method the following studies has been performed with respect to the repeatibility of the main data , the influence of the temperature change rate on @xmath73 dependiences , as well as , to the influence of the applied voltage on @xmath73 . to this purpose",
    "more than 50 control measurements of the heating - cooling cycles were performed .",
    "the estimation of the credibility of the measured data is 95 % .",
    "thus , it is more than enough to exclude incidentality .",
    "the velocity of the temperature change was 3 - 27 @xmath2/min in the whole measured temperature interval .",
    "it was established that there was no influence to the amplitudes of the registered features and to their positions on the temperature scale .",
    "the most changes in the @xmath73 dependence took place only when decrease the voltage applied to the experimental cell .",
    "the voltage was changed in the interval from 1 @xmath60 - 5 @xmath74 .",
    "the choice of the highest voltage limit was restricted by the shape of the @xmath65 characteristics ( see fig .",
    "4 ) because the measurements should take place only on the linear part of the curve .",
    "the application of the lowest voltage limit was connected with the equipment parameters .",
    "7 shows the temperature dependence of the current through the @xmath75 sandwich at the applied voltage of 0.1 @xmath61 .",
    "the comparison of the curves presented in fig . 6 and",
    "7 shows the same features in the temperature range near the magnetic transition .",
    "the main changes are only visible in the temperature areas between both the first and second , as well as , between the second and the third regions .",
    "we see that the begin of the second region is shifted to higher temperatures of about 7 @xmath2 .",
    "the typical current step between the second and the third area disappears ( becomes invisible on the fluctuation amplitude level ) .",
    "it is quite naturally that the decrease of the voltage leads to the decrease of the measuring current , as well as , to the decrease of the fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "this is a trivial result of the ohm s law .",
    "that is why the fine structure of phase transformations near the boundary of the second and third areas are weakly resolved . on the other hand",
    "the applied voltage can influence the surface potential barrier parameters such as shape and width of the barrier .",
    "for example , the width of the barrier should be larger at the lower voltage value than at the higher one .",
    "it is also well known that the tunneling probability decreases when the potential barrier width increases .",
    "the shift of the first low temperature step to the highest temperature region can be explained as follows .",
    "the increase of the barrier width leads to the decrease of the measured sensitivity to the small energetic perturbations onto the metal - polymer ( @xmath66 ) interface .",
    "therefore the pretransition fluctuations were recorded later on the temperature scale than in the case when the applied voltage was greater and the beginning of the curve took place in the area of highest pretransition energetic perturbations .",
    "however , it can be seen that the positions of the lower temperature edges almost coincide in both curves ( fig .",
    "6 and fig . 7 ) .",
    "the electrical measurement applied to the same @xmath0 sample was performed in the temperature range between 300 @xmath2 and 500 @xmath2 using a standard four lead ac method .",
    "the result of this measurement can be seen in fig .",
    "the curve possesses structure with many characteristic temperatures indicating plenty of transformations when heating the sample .",
    "all characteristic temperatures @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the curie temperature @xmath7 in this curve coincide quite good with the previous measurement , depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the temperatures @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath7 agree pretty well also with the result of the potential barrier method , presented in fig . 6 .",
    "the charecteristic temperatures @xmath79 , resolved in fig . 1 , are not seen in fig .",
    "we can , however , see that between @xmath80 and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "8 a very small instability occurs lying on the resolution limit of the resistivity measurement what signalizes only possible transitions . between characteristic temperatures @xmath77 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "8 we can find the temperatures @xmath70 , @xmath82 and @xmath72 , seen also in fig .",
    "6 but not detected in fig . 1 .    when try to theoretically decribe the shape of the resistivity curve we should apply a suitable microscopic model for @xmath0 and use e.g. kubo formula for the electric conductivity [ 40 ] .",
    "this formula , however , contains a current - current thermal average over the gibbs great canonical ensemble with the chemical potential inside ( current - current correlation function ) .",
    "thus , because the chemical potential is sensitive to phase transformationsand magnetic transition at @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) the restivity , calculated with the use of a suitable microscopic model and kubo formula should also reflect all characteristic temperatures of the system via the chemical potential temperature dependence .",
    "in other words , it should be clear that , in fact , the resistivity curve should also be sensitive to different phase transformations and transitions and it is really the case ( see fig . 8) .",
    "we have used three independent methods to detect characteristic temperatures connected with different phase transformations ( transitions ) possible to appear when heating @xmath0 material sample .",
    "it is important to stress that in all three measurements exactly the same sample was used . because of the polycristalline and magnetic nature of the investigated material characteristic temperatures should reflect all the mentioned processes inside the sample under heating , as well as , the magnetic transition at @xmath7 .",
    "the most important results of the paper , presented in fig . 1 , fig . 6 and fig .",
    "8 , entirely support this general statement .",
    "we have , however , to take into account that each particular method , applied in this paper , possesses its own limitations ( sensititvity , resolution depending on temperature , etc . )",
    "and therefore we can not expect the agreement between the methods to be 100% .",
    "the indirect measurement of the chemical potential revealed the existence of the characteristic temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 connected with the characteristic points in fig .",
    "these points corresponded to kinks , change in slope and local maxima ( minima ) of the @xmath30 curve .",
    "it is important to stress that the characteristic temperatures @xmath40 where detected below the melting point of the electrolyte @xmath37 ( see fig . 1 ) and",
    "their values coincided quite well with the instabilities of the resistivity curve , depicted in fig .",
    "it makes an evidence that the @xmath30 measurement can also be useful in the temperature range lying below the melting temperature of the electrolyte , used in the experiment .",
    "the characteristic temperatures @xmath83 , @xmath10 and the curie temperature @xmath7 ( of about 410 @xmath84 ( see e.g. refs [ 1]-[6 ] ) ) , found in fig .",
    "1 , correspond quite well with the irregularities in the resistivity curve in fig .",
    "there were , however , characteristic points @xmath79 , resolved in fig . 1 , but hardly seen in fig .",
    "8 because the irregularities in the temperature range from @xmath80 to @xmath77 were so small that they could be interpreted ( when looking only in fig .",
    "8) as a measurement error .",
    "the characteristic points @xmath79 were , however , resolved in fig .",
    "6 . in the temperature range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "1 the @xmath30 curve is smooth",
    ". it does not indicate at all the existence of the characteristic temperatures @xmath70 , @xmath85 and @xmath72 , very well seen in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "may be that the @xmath30 measurement was not sensitive enough to resolve these characteristic temperatures .",
    "the same can be said about the temperatures corresponding to many peaks in fig .",
    "6 , not resolved in fig . 1 and fig . 8 .",
    "we should , however , to be aware of the fact that from three methods applied here a more static was the @xmath30 measurement . the current flow through the @xmath0 sample , recorded when using the potential barrier method or resistivity measurement can , in principle ,",
    "( as a  dynamic ",
    "effect ) small structural changes in the sample during the mesurement process ( influence grain boundaries , domain structure , etc . ) which manifested itself in a form of additional peaks in fig .",
    "6 ( not resolved in fig . 1 and fig . 8) and additional characteristic points ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath86 ) in fig . 6 and in fig .",
    "8 , not seen in the @xmath30 measurement ( fig .",
    "a more general conclusion resulting from three independent measurements is certainly this that the characteristic points @xmath6 and @xmath7 from fig .",
    "1 can not be interpreted as artifacts because they appear as a result of three independent measurements .",
    "unfortunately , due to very small signal when using the potential barrier method in the temperature range below 340 @xmath2 the charecteristic temperatures @xmath87 , present in fig . 1",
    ", are confirmed only by the resistvity measurement in fig 8 .",
    "the methods complement each other and indicate transformation ( transition ) temperatures of the measured system .",
    "they say , however , nothig about the origin of a given transformation ( transition ) . to obtain a more detailed information what really happens at a given characteristic temperature we should apply another experimental methods ( it lies outside of the scope of the present paper ) .",
    "the information about transition temperatures of the system is , however , very useful indication because we exactly know in which temperature range another additional experiments should be performed to find the origin of the transformation ( transition ) .",
    "three methods applied in this paper possess something in common .",
    "all of them visualize very important role of the chemical potential in phase transformations ( transitions ) of real solids as suggested in refs [ 17]-[26 ] .",
    "we have shown that at characteristic temperatures the chemical potential of the electronic subsystem of the investigated material changes in such a way that we can record it as a physical reality and interpret it in three independent measurements ( fig . 1 , fig . 6 , fig .",
    "8) as a signal of the arriving phase transformation ( transition ) .",
    "taking as an example magnetic @xmath88 sample we have also demonstrated that the heating process of solids ( especially policristalline ) is by no means a simple and smooth process because except for the magnetic transition at @xmath7 the system transits many other phase transformations , mentioned above ."

    "<S> the second method revealed also several additional characteristic temperatures which could be seen from appearing peaks in the measured resistivity of the sandwich vs temperature but not seen when using the first method . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the third method ( the resistivity measurement vs temperature ) revealed almost the same values for the characteristic temperatures @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 as found with the use of the first method but several , additional characteristic temperatures could also be detected which are not seen when apply the first method and seen with the use of the second one . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of characteristic temperatures , confirmed with the use of three independent measurements make an evidence that plenty of transformations ( transitions ) really take place when heating the polycristalline @xmath0 sample . </S>",
    "<S> the applied methods complement each other and can successfully be used to detect characteristic temperatures of the system connected with different phase transformations .    </S>",
