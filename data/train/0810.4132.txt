    "neutrinos are hoped to enlighten the search for new physics at both the cosmological and microscopic level .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations at the superkamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite detectors prompted a detailed examination of the theory of neutrino oscillations ( some early references are pontecorvo  @xcite , kayser  @xcite , bilenky  @xcite ; see giunti and kim  @xcite for further references ) .",
    "some papers were dedicated to obtaining the formula for the oscillation probability from first principles .",
    "there are some aspects in these derivations that we do not find very precise and that we want to address in this paper .",
    "beuthe @xcite and giunti @xcite stress the fact that the pattern of neutrino oscillations depends on the mechanism of production and detection , in other words , the oscillation amplitude is different if neutrinos are produced in pion decay or from a charged current interaction .",
    "we believe that , following standard rules of quantum mechanics , the pattern of oscillations should only depend on the initial state of the system .",
    "the particular production mechanism needs to be specified only to determine the initial state .",
    "analogously , for detection , quantum mechanics can provide the probability of detecting a neutrino in any specific final state .",
    "in other words , the theoretical description of the phenomenon of oscillations should involve the initial state , its evolution and a final state representing the detection process .",
    "this is because of the quantum mechanical properties of the system , which state that different ways of producing the same initial wave packet should bring to the same result .    in their articles , beuthe @xcite and giunti @xcite average their final formulas for the oscillation probability over time , justifying this because the arrival time is not detectable .",
    "we will not perform this average because , from a fully theoretical treatment , oscillations occur both in space and time on the same footage .",
    "we will show how this feature of neutrino oscillations is related to the covariance of the oscillation formula and to the problem of defining an equal energy or equal momentum condition for the various mass eigenstates .",
    "snellman and pallin @xcite derived the expression for the oscillation amplitude by propagating a second - quantized neutrino wave packet in vacuum and in matter , intentionally neglecting any theory concerning production and detection of neutrinos . however in their paper there is a misuse of flavor and mass eigenstates .",
    "in fact , for the construction of the wave packets , the authors in @xcite use the neutrino flavor representation and introduce concepts such as the energy @xmath0 of a neutrino with flavor @xmath1 . since neutrino flavor states are not eigenstates of the free hamiltonian , the flavor - eigenstate energy @xmath0 is not well defined .",
    "moreover , the authors in @xcite use the formula @xmath2 , where they state that @xmath3 is the mass of the flavor @xmath1 .",
    "this is misleading because a flavor eigenstate , being a linear combination of different mass eigenstates , does not have a well - defined mass .    in this paper , we recover the formula for neutrino oscillations in flat space - time using the propagation of second quantized gaussian wave packets .",
    "we choose wave packets instead of monochromatic plane waves because we want to represent neutrino states that are  localized \" near the production and later near the detection point , but plane waves are  everywhere \" at the same time .",
    "in addition , wave packets are normalizable while plane waves are not .",
    "another reason is that by using them we can study the coherence between eigenfunctions with different mass ( and thus different group velocities ) .",
    "we also remedy the misuse of flavor states and flavor properties in @xcite by deriving the neutrino oscillation formula using mass eigenstates only .",
    "after all , it is the mass eigenstates that appear in the perturbative expansions of the scattering processes , for example in the green functions and the feynman rules .",
    "finally , we show numerical results for the case of two neutrino generations , for realistic mass differences and for the pedagogical case of a large mass difference .",
    "the latter case illustrates how decoherence suppresses the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "before recovering the transition probability formula we first establish our notation by reviewing the description of the dirac and majorana free fields in quantum field theory in the heisenberg picture .",
