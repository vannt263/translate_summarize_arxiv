    "the nature of magnetic order in the geometrically frustrated trigonal cobaltate , an ising - type magnet exhibiting low - dimensional behavior , has been a puzzle for over a decade .",

    "[ fig : struct ] ) may be viewed as the result of the alternate stacking along the @xmath1 axis of face - sharing coo@xmath2 octahedra ( coi ) and coo@xmath2 trigonal prisms ( coii ) with a rather short coi - coii distance @xmath3 , building up _ chains _ arranged over the @xmath4 plane in a triangular lattice , with a much larger spacing ( inter - chain distance @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite the  oxidation state at both sites is now established , @xcite contrary to earlier predictions for a -   charge disproportionation .",
    "@xcite    magnetism resides on the coii site , where a trigonal crystal field yields a high - spin ground state with a large unquenched orbital component ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , while coi is in a low - spin state ( i.e.  non - magnetic ) .",
    "@xcite spin - orbit coupling gives rise to a single - ion anisotropy term @xmath8 of order 70  mev ( corresponding to an anisotropy field @xmath9 t along @xmath1 ) , whence the strong ising - type character of magnetism in this system .",
    "@xcite exchange coupling between the ii ions is ferromagnetic ( fm ) and relatively strong along the chains , whereas it is antiferromagnetic ( af ) and much weaker between chains . while the dominant intra - chain exchange interaction promotes quasi one - dimensional ising - type ferromagnetism ,",
    "the actual magnetic structure is the result of the competing residual inter - chain af coupling , giving rise to a complex magnetic phenomenology as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",

    "the dark and light polyhedra represent the coo@xmath2 octahedra and coo@xmath2 trigonal prisms , respectively . ]",
    "susceptibility measurements actually demonstrate the onset of magnetic order at @xmath10  k. @xcite the nature of magnetic ordering however , has been the subject of a long - lasting controversy . denoting spin - up , spin - down , or magnetically disordered ising chains as @xmath11,@xmath12,0 , respectively , theoretical models indicated either a ferrimagnetic ( fi ) @xmath13 $ ] or a partially disordered antiferromagnetic ( pda ) structure @xmath14 $ ] as the stable zero - field arrangements of the three inequivalent chains on the triangular lattice in the presence of geometrically frustrated af inter - chain coupling.@xcite early neutron diffraction experiments seemingly supported either a pda @xcite or a fi @xcite order , although poor quantitative agreement of both structures with magnetic peak intensities was later pointed out .",
    "@xcite recent x - ray @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite data on single crystals have revealed the incommensurate character of the magnetic order in this compound .",
    "they show that the actual structure , referred to as _ modulated pda _ ( mpda ) , rather consists of long - wavelength longitudinal spin - density modulations along each chain , phase - shifted by @xmath15 with respect to the neighboring chains .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the mpda phase is apparently metastable below 14k , as indicated by the decrease in the intensity of the mpda magnetic peaks .",
    "@xcite    the nature of the magnetic order in an externally applied magnetic field is also far from clear . increasing magnetic fields applied along @xmath1",
    "tend to stabilize the fi phase and eventually fm inter - chain order . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the initial saturation of the magnetization to a magnetic moment @xmath17 per formula unit at @xmath18 , followed by a step to @xmath19 at @xmath20 , actually points to perfect fi and fm phases below and above @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath22 curves at lower temperatures display a puzzling multi - step behavior reminiscent of the quantum tunneling of magnetization detected in molecular magnets .",
    "@xcite a number of complex magnetic superstructures , distinct from both the fi and fm spin - chain arrangements , have been proposed in order to explain the fractional magnetization values .",
    "however , such superstructures can not account for all the plateaus observed in @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we address the issue of the field - dependent magnetic order of  by means of  nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "previous  nmr research on  polycrystalline samples , though successful in demonstrating the presence of non - magnetic , could only provide very limited information on the magnetic structure , due to the angular averaging of the complex multi - line quadrupolar spectra into broad powder patterns .",
    "@xcite the fm and fi surroundings , on the contrary , can be clearly resolved in our nmr investigation of a high - quality single crystal , while the two field - induced transitions , namely mpda - fi and fi - fm , were precisely identified at 10k through step - like jumps in the internal field and peculiar features of the spin - spin relaxations , indicative of glassy spin dynamics .",
    "our study also yields a detailed characterization of the chemical shift and the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensors at the non - magnetic coi site .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sample preparation and the experimental methods are briefly described in section [ sec : experimental ] .",
    "nmr spectra , providing information on the magnetic structures , and nuclear relaxation data , probing the dynamical excitations of the spin system , are presented in sections [ sec : results.spectra ] , and [ sec : results.relax ] , respectively .",
    "the calculated dipolar fields at the coi sites in the fi and fm phases are compared with experimental values in section [ sec : dipfield ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "two appendices review in some detail the complex dependence of the  resonances on magnetic and quadrupolar interactions , and the longitudinal relaxation function of a @xmath23 nuclear spin .",
    "the investigated sample was a single crystal of size @xmath24 mm@xmath25 ( the long side parallel to the @xmath1 axis ) taken from a batch of several needle - shaped crystals obtained by the flux method .",
    "the crystals were grown using the following procedure : a mixture of   powder and kco@xmath26 ( the flux ) , in a weight ratio 1/7 , was heated up to 990@xmath27c in an alumina crucible for one hour and then slowly cooled down to room temperature .",
    "a sample of the same batch was employed for the resonant x - ray scattering study of ref .  .",
    "the high quality of the crystals was confirmed by preliminary x - ray diffraction , energy dispersive x - ray , magnetization , and specific heat measurements .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed after zero field cooling , by using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( oxford instruments ) equipped with a 12 t magnet , with a field sweep rate of 1t / min in order to minimize any relaxation effect .",
    "susceptibility measurements were carried out by means of a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( squid ) with magnetic fields up to 5 t and temperatures down to 1.8k ( quantum design mpms ) .",
    "the magnetic measurements were carried out for the two geometries corresponding to the magnetic field applied parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath1 axis , i.e.  parallel or perpendicular the direction of the chains and the spins . in the case of parallel geometry the crystals",
    "were aligned using the magnetic field itself at 5 t as explained in ref .  .",
    "the alignment of the crystals in the perpendicular geometry can be easily obtained thanks to their rod - like shape .",
    "the nmr experiments were performed by means of a home - built phase - coherent pulsed spectrometer @xcite and a fast - sweeping cold - bore cryomagnet ( oxford instruments exa ) equipped with a variable temperature insert as a sample environment .",
    "the crystal was mounted on a sample rotator , providing an angular span of @xmath28 with respect to the applied field .",
    "misalignment of the rotation axis ( nominally perpendicular to the field ) was estimated not to exceed 5 degrees . in the case of the @xmath1 axis parallel to the field ,",
    "however , a precise alignment of the sample was achieved , thanks to its large magnetic anisotropy , by loosely mounting it in the coil .",
    "nmr spectra were detected by exciting spin echoes by means of a standard @xmath29 sequence , with equal rf pulses @xmath30 of duration 3 - 5 @xmath31 and intensity suitably regulated for optimum signal , and delays @xmath32 kept as short as possible with respect to the dead time of the resonant probehead ( @xmath3310 - 25@xmath34s depending on the working frequency ) .",
    "recording was carried out either by tuning the probehead at discrete frequencies in a constant field ( frequency sweep mode ) , or by varying the applied field and exciting the resonance at a constant frequency ( field sweep mode ) .",
    "although an indirect method , we preferentially employed the latter whenever possible ( namely , far from the metamagnetic transitions ) as it yields smoother data , independent of the frequency response of the spectrometer , in a fully automated procedure .",
    "nuclear spin - spin relaxations were determined by the decay of the signal amplitude in the same spin echo sequence @xmath29 , as a function of variable delay @xmath32 .",
    "spin - lattice relaxations were measured by the signal recovery following a so - called fast saturation of the observed nuclear transition ( see appendix [ sec : redfield ] ) , obtained with an aperiodic train of 10 - 15 pulses .",
    "we report separately the  resonance spectra recorded in the longitudinal geometry ( external field @xmath35 axis ) , a geometry that allowed us study the field - induced magnetic order in the system , and in transverse applied fields .",
    "interpretation of the spectra is relatively simple and model - independent in the longitudinal case , due to the collinearity of all the fields ( internal and external magnetic fields , and the efg ) . in the general case ,",
    "the dependence of the  resonances on magnetic and quadrupolar interactions is rather complex , as recalled in some detail in appendix [ sec : nuc ] .",
    "a  nmr signal could be detected below 15  k in moderate longitudinal external magnetic fields @xmath36 t .",
    "such field values assign the system to the fi phase . for such field values",
    "the fi phase is induced in the system .",
    "in contrast , no signal could be detected in the mpda phase at @xmath37 t .",
    "a typical frequency - sweep spectrum , recorded at 10  k in 0.38  t , is plotted in fig.[fig : fsfi ] .",
    "the spectrum consists in a septet of quadrupole - split zeeman transitions @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : nuqm ] ) , with constant frequency spacing @xmath40  mhz , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "in this geometry ( @xmath41 ) , and in the presence of a cylindrical efg ( @xmath42 ) , as is actually the case ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results.spectra.trans ] ) , such a line spacing coincides with the quadrupolar coupling parameter @xmath43 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : abc ] ) .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath44 of the central line , which is unaffected by the quadrupole interaction , corresponds to a field @xmath45 at the nucleus which is larger than @xmath46 by approximately 1.2  t ( here , @xmath47mhz / t @xcite is the gyromagnetic ratio of ) .",
    "such a field offset , though sizable , is nevertheless much smaller than the typical hyperfine fields detected in magnetic , which are of the order of -10  t/@xmath48 and + 60  t/@xmath48 for the spin and orbital hyperfine components , respectively .",
    "@xcite this confirms that the present  signals are from  ions in a low - spin state , in agreement with previous nmr reports .",
    "@xcite we note that the dipolar field at site i generated by two nearest - neighbor coii moments of 5.2  @xmath48 aligned parallel to @xmath49 accounts for both the positive sign of the field offset @xmath50 , and its magnitude to within a few percent accuracy .",
    "this is the first indication that the internal field @xmath51 arises from the surrounding magnetic ions essentially through the dipolar coupling , as actually proven in detail by the internal field calculations of sec .",
    "[ sec : dipfield ] . given its dominant on - chain dipolar origin ,",
    "the positive sign of @xmath52 then indicates that the nearest - neighbor  spins are aligned along the direction of the applied field .",
    "the present positive - offset line multiplet therefore originates from nuclei at the coi sites of spin chains aligned parallel to the external field , namely , the majority chains of the fi structure .     frequency - swept  spectrum at 10  k from the majority spin - up chains of the fi phase , recorded in a field of 0.38  t applied along the @xmath1 axis .",

    "the signal loss at @xmath80 is due to the approach of the fi - fm transition at @xmath81 t , which is accompanied by a notable relaxation phenomenon that partially wipes out the signal intensity over a wide field interval close to @xmath82 ( see below ) . the rightmost satellite at @xmath83 is furthermore displaced from the expected position by approx .",

[ fig : fmlines ] ) .",

    "we organize the discussion of our experimental results into separate sections for sake of clarity , each one focusing on one main conclusion of the paper .      our nmr study on a single - crystal provides a determination of the chemical shift and the efg tensors at the coi site .",
    "the chemical shift is less precise due to the uncertainty in the zero - shift  reference @xcite and to the presence of a large internal field which complicates the unraveling of @xmath100 components ( see appendix [ sec : nuc ] ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath180 , of order 1% , though sizable in absolute terms , is however only slightly larger than the typical values reported for diamagnetic complexes of cobalt .",
    "@xcite the relatively small value of @xmath180 agrees with the known large crystal field splitting at the octahedral i site , of order 0.65ev , @xcite since a near - lying crystal field excited multiplet usually gives rise to a large chemical shift via the van - vleck mechanism , as often encountered in non - magnetic transition metal ions .",
    "the efg exhibits cylindrical symmetry around @xmath1 , in accordance with the fact that @xmath1 axis is a @xmath181 symmetry element of the point group of coi .",
    "consistent values of the quadrupolar frequency @xmath43 ( proportional to the efg ) are estimated in different chain types and experimental geometries , with the notable exception of the minority chains in external longitudinal fields approaching the fi - fm transition value @xmath182 , where an efg deviation of order -7% is found , well beyond the experimental uncertainty .",
    "we argue that a magnetoelastic coupling of the   ions in counter - oriented minority chains might be the source of the observed efg reduction , as already proposed for other cobalt - based compounds studied by m \" ossbauer spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    the internal field @xmath52 at the non - magnetic coi site can be accounted for by purely dipolar interactions with the surrounding coii spins , within an absolute accuracy of 2  mt in all of the three chain types .",
    "this result , along with the experimental value of @xmath100 , sets a very stringent upper limit to a transferred hyperfine field at the nucleus .    the contact hyperfine field may originate from both a tiny on - site magnetic moment on coi , as that invoked in a neutron scattering refinement , @xcite and from the coupling to nearest neighbors coii spins .",
    "these two contributions might partially cancel out , since either sign is possible.@xcite additional inter - chain contributions are negligible in view of the large chain spacing . nevertheless , we can safely rule out an on - site term , since a residual on - site moment would require an admixture of the @xmath183 with the excited @xmath184 orbitals , in contrast with the large crystal field excitation energy implied by the observed moderate chemical shift value .",
    "for instance , a huge chemical shift @xmath185 was reported for the resonance of @xmath186pr in low - spin pr@xmath187 , in combination with a small fractional moment @xmath188 on the pr ion .",
    "@xcite therefore , only the transferred contribution is to be considered .",
    "an intra - chain transferred hyperfine term @xmath189 would offset the total dipolar field @xmath190 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : dip ] ) by @xmath191 for the fi@xmath11 and fm chains , and by @xmath192 for the fi@xmath12 chains , depending on the relative sign of @xmath190 and @xmath189 .",
    "however , a finite @xmath189 biasing term does not improve the agreement between the calculated @xmath193 and the experimentally determined internal fields .",
    "we conclude therefore that the slight discrepancy between the experimental and the calculated internal fields must be due to other sources of error , and that the contact field , if present , is much smaller than 2mt .",
    "a negligible hyperfine field at the coi site is an unexpected result .",
    "transferred hyperfine fields at nuclei of non - magnetic ions in magnetic compounds of transition metals are typically of the order of several hundreds mt or more , unless perfect cancellation occurs at a symmetric site of an af structure , which is not the case in .",
    "for instance , the transferred hyperfine field at @xmath194la in the fm manganite la@xmath195ca@xmath196mno@xmath26 equals 3 t , i.e.   approximately 10% of the on - site hyperfine field at the mn sites , where the magnetism resides.@xcite here , a virtually vanishing contact field at coi indicates that there is no significant hybridization between the ( i ) and the ( ii ) wave functions either directly or through an oxygen bridge .",
    "the mechanisms underlying exchange and hyperfine transfer are similar , although not exactly identical.@xcite therefore , the lack of a detectable transferred hyperfine field strongly suggests that ( i ) ions do not participate in the exchange interaction @xmath197 between two neighboring on - chain ( ii ) spins .",
    "we stress that this finding constitutes experimental evidence against the currently accepted theoretical model by frsard _",
    "et al . _ , who instead proposed an exchange path across coi assuming a large overlap of ( ii ) with ( i ) wave functions , yielding a direct integral @xmath198ev.@xcite      at 10k two types of field - dependent magnetic structures are detected , namely perfect fi and fm ones , in accordance with the two plateaus in magnetization data at the same temperature .",
    "the two structures are clearly identified by distinct local fields at the coi sites in good quantitative agreement with the dipolar fields calculated for the corresponding spin arrangements .",
    "the transition from a fi to a fm phase shows up as a sharp step in @xmath52 at a threshold field @xmath199 , revealed by an abrupt crossover of the resonance frequency vs.  field between two distinct @xmath200 functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] ) .    quantitative comparison between nmr and magnetization data in longitudinal fields at 10k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magneto ] ) provides an insight into the magnetization process .",
    "close inspection of the magnetization curves as a function of the applied field @xmath201 shows that the steps appear smoother in the @xmath22 curves than in the nmr frequency data @xmath200 ( figure inset ) .",
    "moreover , the plateaus in @xmath22 are only approximately flat , with a moderate field dependence that is larger in the fi state ( for instance , @xmath202 for @xmath203 ) .    in principle , incomplete saturation of @xmath22 over the plateaus might be due to either unsaturated @xmath1 axis components of individual moments in a homogeneously magnetized sample ( e.g.  due to spin canting ) , or inhomogeneous magnetization , although the former could not easily be reconciled with the known strong single ion anisotropy of the system .",
    "nmr demonstrates experimentally that the cobalt spins are collinear and saturated even in the vicinity of the fi - fm transition .",
    "proof is provided by the field proportionality coefficient @xmath61 of eqn .",
    "[ eq : linear ] , whose experimental values for the three chain types were found to coincide within an error @xmath204khz / t .",
    "the observed value of @xmath205 contributes a 15  khz / t slope ( i.e.  of order @xmath206 ) to @xmath200 via the demagnetization field , regardless of the mechanism responsible for it , and independent of the magnetic order in a chain .",
    "a hypothetical field dependent canting , however , would affect the dipolar field at coi , which is larger than the demagnetization field by an order of magnitude ( tab .  [",
    "tab : dip ] ) . unless we assume equal canting in the fm , fi spin - up , and the fi spin - down chains , which is clearly unphysical , the latter would produce differences in the @xmath61 coefficients of the three lines well beyond experimental errors , and contrary to experimental evidence .    as seen from nmr ,",
    "the system apparently exhibits perfect ising behavior .",
    "therefore , the rounded steps in the @xmath22 data at the field - induced metamagnetic transitions , with unsaturated magnetization over broad @xmath207 intervals near them , must be due to a fraction of misoriented domains or spin chains .",

    "further insight on the spin reversal process close to the mpda - fi and fi - fm transitions is provided by the large and divergent spin - spin relaxations , accompanied by much smaller and non - divergent spin - lattice relaxations .",
    "we recall that the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath135 probes transverse random magnetic fields fluctuating at the larmor frequency @xmath210 , while the spin - spin rate @xmath133 is the sum of a term proportional to @xmath135 ( the population term ) and a secular term arising from longitudinal random fields fluctuating at virtually zero frequency .",
    "@xcite in the presence of isotropic and fast fluctuations in the so - called narrowing limit ( such that @xmath210 is much smaller than the roll - off frequency of the fluctuation spectrum ) the two rates tend to coincide .",
    "@xcite here , the similar behavior of relaxations measured in longitudinal and oblique external fields rules out the possibility that anisotropic fluctuations , namely , entirely along the @xmath1 axis and hence ineffective for spin - lattice relaxations , are the source of the huge difference in @xmath146 and @xmath148 time scales .",
    "excess spin - spin relaxation and @xmath133 peaks must instead depend on fluctuations in a regime opposite to the narrowing limit , namely with characteristic frequencies much lower than @xmath210 and hence contributing only to the secular term in @xmath133 .",
    "such a regime , which has already been reported in the literature for other oxides , @xcite is referred to hereafter as the nearly - static limit .    to this end ,",
    "the kubo - tomita theory of line shape appropriate for continuous - wave magnetic resonance @xcite is modified in the context of pulsed nmr by an experimental low - frequency cutoff , namely the reciprocal time window @xmath211 of a spin - echo experiment ( here , @xmath32 is the time separation of the two excitation pulses ) .",
    "random fields fluctuating at frequencies @xmath212 may be viewed as static over the excitation - detection transient and contribute only to the inhomogeneous line broadening , which is refocused by the spin echo sequence .",
    "conversely , fluctuations at @xmath213 effectively relax the spin - echo signal .",
    "within the nearly - static limit , the decrease of @xmath133 with decreasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relax_vs_t ] ) then indicates the collapse of the fluctuation spectrum below the cutoff @xmath214 at lower temperatures , down to a complete freezing of the spin dynamics observed at @xmath215 .",
    "it is worth noting that evidence for comparable time scales in the spin dynamics was also reported from @xmath216 and @xmath217 ac magnetic susceptibilities in the zero - field phase , both showing a strong frequency dependence over the acoustic and subacoustic range .",
    "@xcite the nearly gaussian @xmath148 relaxation form is another signature of nuclear spin depolarization from quasi static random fields . @xcite in our case , random fields are clearly electronic in origin , since the calculated second moment of the nuclear dipolar fields yields a @xmath133 rate smaller than the observed ones by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the peculiar behavior of @xmath133 rates therefore reflects the exceedingly slow spin dynamics , as in the case of massive excitation modes involving the collective motion of several spins . in view of the strong ising character of the system",
    ", such excitations probably consist in the coherent reversal of large portions of the spin chains or domains .",
    "the slowly fluctuating random fields responsible for spin - spin relaxation are then straightforwardly identified with the stray dipolar fields originating from such transient defects in the magnetic structure .",
    "also the peaks in @xmath133 and the stretched exponent @xmath137 at the metamagnetic transitions finds a natural explanation within this framework .",
    "a peak in @xmath133 vs.  @xmath46 may arise in principle from either a field - dependent correlation time of fluctuations , or a peak in the random field amplitude .",
    "in the nearly - static fluctuation regime , however , field dependence of the correlation time would imply _ faster _ spin fluctuations at the peak .",
    "the latter is apparently inconsistent with the peaks in @xmath137 vs.  @xmath46 reaching nearly - gaussian values of 1.5 at @xmath182 and @xmath82 , a signature of a nearly frozen spin dynamics , following the above argument .",
    "the @xmath133 peak must therefore originate from a corresponding increase of the quasi - static magnetic disorder , namely a larger number of misoriented domains or chain fragments , close to the transitions .",
    "we note that the peaks of @xmath137 vs.  @xmath46 coherently reflect changes in the spatial distribution of random fields on approaching the metamagnetic transitions . according to a well - known mechanism , @xcite the transition from a quasi - gaussian to a quasi - lorentzian line shape",
    "may be driven by an increasing dilution of ( nearly ) static magnetic impurities or defects , and vice versa .",
    "thus , the larger disorder probed by @xmath133 peaks consistently coincides with a larger concentration of magnetic defects indicated by @xmath218 , which agrees with the shortening of the magnetic coherence length observed on approaching the field - induced transitions .",
    "@xcite    in contrast , spin - lattice relaxations are governed by independent excitations , whose effect on @xmath148 is unimportant as it is masked by the relaxation channel sketched above .",
    "the thermally activated behavior of @xmath135 reveals a _ gap _",
    "@xmath219 of order 100k in their spectrum .",
    "a thorough investigation of @xmath219 as a function of @xmath46 for the different chain types , and a fitting of the experimental energy gaps to a theoretical model , are the subject of a separate paper . here",
    "we anticipate that , according to the model , the activated spin - lattice relaxations are essentially driven by the spin - flip of a single   moment .",
    "we conclude this discussion with a comment on the low - temperature multi - step behavior in @xmath22 .",
    "the magnetic structures underlying each step could not be accessed in our nmr study , due to the non - spherical shape of our sample , inducing demagnetization - dependent line broadening and offsets which prevent finer resolution of dipolar fields , as well as to exceedingly slow spin - lattice relaxations below 5  k. nevertheless , @xmath148 data at 7 - 15k reveal a scenario of glassy spin dynamics involving freezing of sizable magnetic aggregates and large quasi - static inhomogeneities close to the field - induced transitions .",
    "the collective arrangement of such frozen entities at lower temperature is unknown .",
    "we may argue however that it gives rise to complex field - dependent micromagnetic configurations or superstructures , resulting in a multiplicity of local minima separated by potential barriers in the free energy , becoming metastable below 2  k. if this picture holds true , however , the physical mechanism behind magnetization steps should be understood in terms of thermally assisted hopping between essentially mesoscopic metastable configurations , probably incommensurate with the crystal lattice , rather than quantum tunneling as in molecular magnets .",
    "the authors thank s.  carretta and p.  santini for helpful and stimulating discussion .",
    "the resonance frequencies of  at the non - magnetic site i , for an arbitrary experimental geometry , depend on the external field and sample alignment in a rather complicated way , which deserves some comment .",
    "the field at the nucleus @xmath220 ( proportional to the resonance frequency @xmath221 ) differs from the local field @xmath141 at the ion site by the chemical shift , @xmath222 , where the chemical shift tensor @xmath100 is usually large and anisotropic in cobalt.@xcite in a magnetic material , the local field is the vector composition of the external and the internal field , @xmath223 , where the internal field @xmath60 originates from the electronic moments .",
