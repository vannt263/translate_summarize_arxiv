    "in the early 1960s , richardson @xcite showed how to exactly solve the pure pairing model including non - degenerate single - particle orbits for both fermion @xcite and boson systems @xcite . in 2001 ,",
    "dukelsky , esebbag and schuck @xcite showed how to generalize richardson s solution , making use of analogous work by gaudin @xcite for spin models , so that the resulting richardson - gaudin models can now describe the physics of a wide variety of strongly - correlated many - body quantum systems governed by pairing correlations .",
    "many interesting applications of these exactly - solvable models have been reported recently , to ultrasmall superconducting grains @xcite , to nuclear superconductivity @xcite , to the nuclear interacting boson model @xcite , and to bose einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the methods have been applied both to fermion and boson systems , invariably yielding useful insight into the properties of the complex quantum systems they model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with slight generalization the methods have also proven useful in the description of mixed systems involving atoms ( either bosonic or fermionic ) coupled to molecular dimers in the presence of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "all of the above models were based on the treatment of pairing correlations involving identical particles .",
    "the relevant algebraic structure for describing identical - particle pairing is su(2 ) for fermions or su(1,1 ) for bosons .",
    "both are rank - one algebras with just one cartan generator .",
    "there has been several efforts to derive exactly - solvable richardson - gaudin models based on larger rank algebras @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rank - two so(5 ) algebra describing isovector proton - neutron pairing was treated in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the complete solution of the so(5 ) richardson - gaudin model was presented in ref .",
    "this made possible an exact treatment of isovector proton - neutron pairing in the presence of non - degenerate single - particle levels , which was used in a description of the @xmath5 nucleus @xmath6ge in an extended shell - model space .    in this paper , we describe the first example of an exactly - solvable richardson - gaudin model of interacting _ bosons _ that is based on a rank - two algebra .",
    "the model has the algebraic structure so(3,2 ) and is of relevance to two - component boson systems .",
    "one possible realization is a mixture of @xmath7rb atoms in the hyperfine states @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "while these systems have been studied @xcite in mean - field approximation , more elaborate approximate methods or the use of exact solutions are needed to study effects beyond mean field . here",
    "we will concentrate on a different realization , namely bosonic models of nuclei with distinct proton and neutron degrees of freedom .",
    "when only @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are included , the resulting models are restricted versions of the proton - neutron interacting boson model ( ibm2 ) @xcite , in the transitional regime between gamma - unstable and vibrational nuclei . at the same time",
    ", however , their generality makes it possible to address many issues that can not be discussed within the context of the ibm2 .",
    "in particular , the models can readily accommodate boson degrees of freedom other than just @xmath0 and @xmath1 , still within a proton - neutron framework .",
    "as such , they can address issues related to the proton - neutron degree of freedom in boson models with @xmath3 bosons and/or @xmath4 bosons .",
    "the models can also accommodate f - spin breaking , which can thus likewise be studied in the presence of bosons other than @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief overview of the so(3,2 ) algebra , confirming that it is indeed a rank - two algebra and obtaining its associated integrals of motion . in section iii ,",
    "we show how this formalism can be used to build exactly solvable models of relevance to interacting neutron and proton bosons in atomic nuclei . in section",
    "iv we consider as specific examples models involving @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 degrees of freedom and describe their exact solutions in a variety of scenarios . in section",
    "v , we summarize the principal conclusions of this work .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the elements of the cartan decomposition of the so(3,2 ) lie algebra and show how it can be used to build the set of integrals of motion for models based on multiple copies of this algebra .",
    "we will be considering a problem involving neutron and proton boson degrees of freedom , with creation and annihilation operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "these operators create / annihilate a boson of angular momentum @xmath15 , projection @xmath16 and type @xmath17 .",
    "now consider the set of bilinear boson operators ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    and the corresponding two - boson annihilation operators @xmath23 . here",
    "the scalar product @xmath24 has the usual definition @xmath25 for each @xmath15 , there are four particle - hole operators , three pair creation operators , and three pair annihilation operators . all told , these ten operators generate an so(3,2 ) algebra .    the cartan decomposition of this algebra is achieved by rewriting the set of one - body operators as    @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29",
    "it can be readily confirmed that @xmath30=0 $ ] . as there are no other generators that simultaneously commute with both , so(3,2 )",
    "is a rank - two algebra and these two operators generate the cartan subalgebra . [",
    "note : the factor @xmath31 is included in the cartan operators to ensure that the cartan - weyl basis is orthonormal with respect to the killing form of ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "the remaining generators are the ladder operators of the algebra . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the raising operators and correspondingly @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the lowering operators .    knowing the cartan decomposition for each @xmath15 , we can obtain the associated set of integrals of motion @xmath36 , following ref .",
    "the complete set of hermitean and mutually commuting operators with linear and quadratic terms _ in the rational model _ can be expressed in the form    @xmath37    where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the two cartan operators of the copy @xmath15 , and    @xmath40    for a problem involving @xmath41 copies of a rank - two so(3,2 ) algebra the integrals of motion depend on a total of @xmath42 free parameters , the @xmath41 coefficients @xmath43 and the two parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath3 , that enter in the linear term of eq .",
    "( [ ri ] ) .",
    "the exact solutions of the rational model correspond to solving the eigenvalue equations    @xmath45 can be written as    @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the number of non - paired @xmath17 bosons ( _ i.e. _ , the seniority ) in the level @xmath15 , and which define completely the so(3,2 ) irreducible representation of copy @xmath15 .",
    "also , @xmath52 is proportional to the degeneracy of the levels , @xmath53 is the total number of paired @xmath54 bosons , and @xmath55 is the total number of pairs .",
    "finally , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are two sets of spectral parameters that must satisfy the set of coupled equations    @xmath58 @xmath59 these are generalized richardson equations appropriate to the so(3,2 ) algebra .",
    "once the free parameters that define the @xmath36 integrals of motion have been chosen , any linear combination , @xmath60 of those integrals of motion also gives rise to an exactly - solvable model for the multiple copies of the so(3,2 ) algebra , with eigenvalues obtained from the corresponding @xmath61 s .",
    "of course , any constant can be added to the hamiltonian without affecting the exact solvability of the model .    for the scenario under discussion , a system of interacting neutron and proton bosons in several levels , it is obviously desirable that the exactly - solvable models that emerge have the appropriate single - particle energies for the various boson degrees of freedom",
    ". this is accomplished by requiring that the coefficients @xmath62 that define the linear combination of integrals of motion are proportional to the single - particle energies of the corresponding boson levels ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "if we furthermore choose the @xmath43 parameters that enter in the definition of the integrals of motion according to @xmath64 , the two - body part of the model hamiltonian likewise emerges in a very simple form , one in which the interaction matrix elements are level - independent .",
    "furthermore , the constant term that is added to the hamiltonian can be chosen so as to leave it in a convenient form .    with these choices ,",
    "the form of the hamiltonian that emerges for multiple copies of the so(3,2 ) algebra is @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 is a constant , and @xmath68 is the identity operator .    the diagonal term in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ hgeneral ] ) depends on @xmath69 a function of the seniorities , and a constant @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the total number of bosons ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the above hamiltonian ( @xmath74 ) can be expressed as    @xmath75 @xmath76\\ ] ] @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the first line is the single particle energy of the non - paired bosons .",
    "the first term of the second line is the energy of the boson pairs , whereas the second term is related to @xmath2-spin symmetry .",
    "it is possible to show that in the @xmath2-spin - symmetric limit ( @xmath79 ) , both terms in the brackets combine to give : @xmath80 = -f(f+1)~.\\ ] ]    it is especially convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hgeneral ] ) in multipole - multipole form , to facilitate a link to the traditional phenomenological hamiltonians used in bosonic descriptions of nuclei .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hgeneral ] ) expressed in terms of multipoles can be written as @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83",
    "the multi - copy so(3,2 ) formalism described in the preceding section has relevance to the proton - neutron interacting boson model of atomic nuclei @xcite . in this model , distinct neutron and proton bosons",
    "are introduced to model collective pairs of identical nucleons .",
    "the standard version of the model is limited to @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , reflecting the fact that the energetically lowest pairs of identical nucleons are invariably those with @xmath84 and @xmath85 and that they are typically well separated from all higher pairs .",
    "the resulting model , usually called the ibm2 , has been used to describe successfully the collective properties of nuclei throughout the periodic table .    soon after the introduction of the ibm2 , it became clear that there was a natural connection of the model both to the nuclear shell model and to the simpler ibm1 model with but one kind of boson .",
    "the relationship to the shell model is contained in the association of the bosons with the lowest collective pairs of identical nucleons .",
    "thus , it is possible to use input from the shell model to help define the hamiltonian that acts in the ibm2 model space .",
    "the relationship to the ibm1 comes through the introduction of a quantum number called @xmath2 spin that distinguishes the two species in ibm2 , the neutron and proton bosons . in an ibm2 hamiltonian that conserves this quantum number ,",
    "the lowest states of the system are those that are maximally symmetric in @xmath2-spin , in other words maximally symmetric under the interchange of neutron and proton bosons .",
    "it is these states that are modelled by the simpler ibm1 .",
    "however , the ibm2 also contains states that are not maximally symmetric under the interchange of neutron and proton bosons , states that are said to have mixed symmetry . in an @xmath2-spin conserving version of ibm2 , these states are decoupled from the states of maximal @xmath2-spin symmetry .    with the above as background , we are now in a position to discuss the relationship between the exactly solvable models that derive from the so(3,2)algebra and the ibm2 .",
    "in particular , if we limit our discussion to two copies of the algebra , one involving an @xmath86 @xmath0 boson and the other involving an @xmath87 @xmath1 boson , then we arrive precisely at a hamiltonian of the ibm2 form .",
    "it is , however , not the most general ibm2 hamiltonian .",
    "rather , as we will see shortly it is a hamiltonian that models the transition between vibrational ( u(5 ) ) and gamma - soft ( so(6 ) ) nuclei within an ibm2 framework .",
    "the hamiltonian that derives in a two - copy @xmath0-@xmath1 realization of so(3,2 ) has the form ( see eqs .",
    "( [ hll],[qll ] ) , with @xmath88 only , and taking @xmath89 ) @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 its eigenvalues can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ egeneral ] ) .",
    "there are a couple of features of this hamiltonian worthy of note .",
    "the first is that as mentioned above it is not a completely general ibm2 hamiltonian , as the quadrupole operator is restricted to @xmath93 .",
    "second , the hamiltonian contains a term @xmath94 , which arises if the single - boson splittings between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels in the two species ( neutrons and protons ) are different , and which will in general break @xmath2-spin symmetry .",
    "@xmath2-spin symmetry is only preserved if @xmath95 .",
    "finally , the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction that enters is an @xmath96 tensor , with a definite relation between the interactions among the different species .",
    "there is no additional majorana interaction in the model , as the term @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ hgeneral ] ) is absorbed completely into the @xmath2-spin - scalar quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "however , when @xmath95 , _ i.e. _ when @xmath2-spin symmetry is preserved , we can add an additional majorana term of arbitrary strength while maintaining the exact solvability of the model .",
    "perhaps the key feature of the exactly - solvable proton - neutron boson models that derive from the multi - copy so(3,2 ) algebra is that they can accommodate boson degrees of freedom other than just the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , they can accommodate any number of boson degrees of freedom , albeit with the restricted hamiltonians that can be accessed . as an example",
    ", the model with @xmath98 and @xmath3 degrees of freedom is of the form ( @xmath89 ) @xmath99 @xmath100 note that it contains all multipole interactions from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "once again , all enter as @xmath96 tensors , with no additional majorana interaction present . here",
    "too , however , a majorana interaction of arbitrary strength can be included if @xmath95 so that @xmath2-spin is conserved .",
    "likewise , we can accommodate @xmath4 bosons , either with or without @xmath3 bosons , still in a proton - neutron boson framework .",
    "when considering @xmath10 and @xmath4 bosons , for example , the class of hamiltonians that arise are ( @xmath89 )    @xmath103 @xmath104 note that now we only have multipoles from @xmath105 through @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 and @xmath106 multipoles all have odd parity ; the @xmath101 multipole has an even - parity component ( @xmath88 ) and an odd - parity component ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "in this section , we apply the various exactly - solvable model hamiltonians developed in the previous section to scenarios of relevance to the collective structure of atomic nuclei .",
    "we first consider a model of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 interacting neutron and proton bosons , for which the relevant hamiltonian was given in eq .",
    "( [ hsdg ] ) .",
    "we compare the results for this model with those of the corresponding model with just @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , ( see eq .",
    "( [ hsd ] ) ) .",
    "the analysis is carried out as a function of the pairing strength @xmath3 , for fixed single - boson energies , with the results shown in fig . 1",
    ".    the complete hilbert space of the model can be split into invariant subspaces characterized by the seniority numbers ( @xmath109 ) . for each seniority",
    ", one has to solve a different set of richardson equations ( [ richeq ] ) to obtain the eigenvalues ( [ egeneral ] ) .",
    "the angular momenta , parities , and f - spin quantum numbers associated with the set of seniorities we consider are shown in table [ seniorities ] .",
    ".seniorities considered in the sd and sdg calculations and their associated angular momenta , parities and f - spin quantum numbers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     thus , this model is very similar to the @xmath11 model shown in fig .  1 , with the @xmath4 boson replacing the @xmath3 boson at precisely the same energy . here",
    "too the second @xmath110 level is trapped , as this is a general phenomenon that occurs whenever there are more than two boson degrees of freedom and a repulsive pairing interaction .",
    "indeed , the spectra for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 models as a function of @xmath3 are very similar .",
    "the exactly - solvable so(3,2 ) richardson - gaudin models do not couple states with broken pairs , which is where differences would have shown up .",

    "( [ hsdf ] ) as a function of the interaction strength @xmath3 , for the seniorities of table [ senioritief ] .",
    "continuous lines correspond to maximal f - spin states , dashed and circled lines refer to mixed symmetry states ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "thick and circled lines indicate states with non - paired f - bosons ( @xmath112 ) , for maximal and mixed f - symmetry states respectively .",
    "only the first excited sate of each seniority is shown . for mixed symmetry states , only states up to total seniority two are plotted .",

    "in this paper , we have described the first example of an exactly - solvable richardson - gaudin model based on a rank - two algebra for bosons .",
    "the example we discussed involved multiple copies of the so(3,2 ) algebra .",
    "we focussed on a specific realization involving proton and neutron bosons subject to a pairing interaction .",
    "the models that emerged are exactly solvable for non - degenerate single - boson energies and for any number of bosonic copies .",
    "when only @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are included , the resulting model is a specific example of the proton - neutron interacting boson model ( ibm2 ) , limited however to the transition from vibrational to gamma - soft motion .",
    "other bosonic degrees of freedom , such as the @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 , can be readily included while still preserving the exact solvability of the model . through the use of these models",
    ", we can address issues related to the role of mixed - symmetry states in proton - neutron boson models with many boson degrees of freedom .",
    "we can even study some limited features associated with @xmath2-spin symmetry breaking for these multi - copy boson models .",
    "one issue addressed here concerned the role of the @xmath3 boson in proton - neutron boson models .",
    "we compared the results of @xmath10 calculations with those of @xmath11 calculations for an @xmath2-spin - symmetric hamiltonian , throughout the vibrational to gamma - soft transition region , and saw that in the presence of a @xmath3 boson several low - lying excited states have their properties dramatically modified as the result of a trapping phenomenon for the pair energies .",
    "we also studied the role of the @xmath4 boson , in the context of an @xmath12 model of interacting proton and neutron bosons . because of some special features of the exactly - solvable models that we treat ,",
    "there were no meaningful differences between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 results , except of course as regards the angular momentum content of the collective states .",
    "the models that we have developed are not limited , however , to proton - neutron boson models of nuclei .",
    "any physical problem involving two species of bosons in which pairing is dominant can be modelled in this way . in section",
