    "the study of geometrically open ( leaky ) quantum systems is a subject of intense research , with recent interest driven in equal parts by concrete applications ( including electronic transport @xcite and microcavity lasers @xcite ) and deep fundamental questions @xcite .",
    "many of the systems of interest display the signatures of quantum chaos , which in the presence of leakage become enriched by the formation of a fractal trapped set in classical limit . over the past decade",
    ", it has been realised that this phenomenon finds a quantum - mechanical analogue in the distribution of the resonances in the complex - energy plane .",
    "the localization of resonance states on the classical trapped set was already observed by casati , maspero and shepelyanski @xcite , who numerically studied the open chirikov map .",
    "mathematical work established that in consequence the resonances follow a modified , fractal , weyl law @xcite .",
    "this fractal weyl law has been confirmed numerically for a wide range of quantum maps @xcite , and numerical @xcite as well as first experimental @xcite work shows that the fractal weyl law also holds for autonomous systems . in a simple physical picture",
    ", this law originates from the increasing phase space resolution as one approaches the classical limit , which results in a proliferation of short - living resonances that follow ballistical classical escape routes @xcite .",
    "the observations of casati , maspero and shepilyanski on the localization of resonance states have been refined by keating @xcite and nonnenmacher and rubin @xcite , who distinguished between the left and right resonance states , and showed for the baker map that all semiclassical measures ( i.e. , all possible semiclassical limits of these states ) localize on the forward respectively the backward trapped set .",
    "later this localization was rigorously shown by nonnenmacher and zworski @xcite for a much larger class of systems .",
    "a classification of the possible semiclassical measures similar to the schnirelman theorem for closed systems is still open and has so far only been obtained for the very special case of the walsh quantized baker map @xcite .",
    "autonomous systems are much richer than maps as they display an additional , even more ubiquitous phenomenon related to quantum - to - classical correspondence , namely , the formation of resonance chains encountered in various systems such as quantum cavities with large openings @xcite , dielectric microresonators with low index materials @xcite , and models of mathematical interest such as convex co - compact surfaces ( schottky surfaces ) @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest resonance chains are supported by a single ballistic trajectory , resulting in a sequence of states in close analogy to those of a particle in a one - dimensional box with leaking walls @xcite .",
    "however , for open chaotic systems the physical picture behind the fractal weyl law implies that the states on such chains must eventually morph into complex wave - chaotic states supported by the trapped set . in this work",
    "we make a first step towards an understanding of the question how these fundamental phenomena fit together .",
    "firstly , we show that the clearly distinguishable resonance chains display systematic interactions driven by the quantization of more than just a single trajectory .",
    "these interactions manifest themselves in systematic oscillations of resonance spacings and life times , which go along with crossings of the chains in the complex plane and oscillations of the phase - space support of the associated resonance states .",
    "secondly , we show that the initially well separated pairs of resonance chains merge and perform more complicated interactions as one moves further into the semiclassical limit .",
    "we also observe that the first merging of the chains is linked to a better phase space resolution of the trapped set .",
    "we develop this picture by considering a paradigmatic open autonomous system with a fractal trapped set , the 3-disk system , which has been introduced by gaspard and rice @xcite and cvitanovic and eckhardt @xcite , and has found several experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "we employ an efficient scattering approach that allows us to calculate resonance states . via these resonance states and the corresponding phase space representations",
    "we can study their localization on classical phase space structures and the connection to the resonance chain structure .",
    "this leads us to the observation that resonances on one chain show a significantly different correlation behavior than resonances on different chains .",
    "the chain structure is thus not only a visual impression but reflects common physical properties . in order to extract the underlying mechanism behind these correlations and modulations",
    ", we formulate an approximate correspondence of the 3-disk system with an open quantum graph , consisting of two edges of different lengths .",
    "this correspondence holds in leading order of the cycle expansion , and implies that the systematic correlations and interactions of the chains originate from the approximate commensurability of the fundamental periodic orbits in the system .",
    "deeper in the semiclassical limit , we find that the merging of resonance chains coincides with an increased population of the classical trapped set by long - living resonance states .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "in we review the key classical and quantum features of the 3-disk system and describe our method to calculate the full spatial structure of the resonance states .",
    "furthermore , we explain how this method can be used to efficiently calculate poincar - husimi distributions , as well as the symmetric phase space distributions proposed by ermann @xcite .",
    "these methods are then used in to relate the resonance states to the underlying classical phase space structures , allowing us to extract the spatial correlations that complement the modulations of the spectral features . in we",
    "describe the approximate correspondence of the 3-disk system with the open quantum graph and discuss how this leads to a phenomenological explanation of our numerical observations .",

    "this procedure is preferable in numerical calculations due to its speed and its stability compared to going the way of decomposing the complete scattering matrix . in the next section we will see that these fourier coefficients also provide an efficient way to calculate phase space representations of the resonant scattering states .      if one is interested in the relation between the resonances and the underlying classical system it is necessary to study the resonance states not only in configuration space , but also in phase space . for closed systems wigner @xcite or the husimi functions",

    "finally we apply the idea of ermann , carlo and saraceno to the poincar - husimi distributions and obtain a symmetric phase space distribution , which we will call _ ecs distribution _ throughout this paper .",
    "let us start with the definition of the poincar - husimi distribution .",
    "following @xcite , this distribution is obtained from the boundary function @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a point on the boundary of one of the disks , parametrized by the dimensionless arclength @xmath81 $ ] ( measured again in units of @xmath0 ) , and @xmath82 is the normal vector at this point . the poincar - husimi distribution @xmath83 then follows by a projection onto a coherent state @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the birkhoff coordinates on the disk .",
    "the poincar - husimi function can be normalized afterwards , but in contrast to closed systems the normalization factor can not be given in closed form .    using the fourier decomposition for the boundary function we obtain at the boundary of disk @xmath59 @xmath86s } \\rme^{-\\frac{\\mathrm{re}\\,k_n a}{2}(s - q)^2 } \\rmd s\\right|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be further evaluated to finally give @xmath87 again only the fourier coefficients @xmath88 of the resonance state appear in the expression , which thus can be evaluated knowing the singular vector @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast to for the wave function , the formula for the poincar - husimi distribution contains no bessel and hankel functions but only exponential functions , and can thus be calculated much faster .",
    "the simple but efficient idea of ermann , carlo and saraceno is to take not only the left or the right resonant states for the definition of the husimi distribution , but to take the product of the projection of both states on the coherent state @xcite . applied to the definition of the poincar - husimi representation this leads to @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the boundary functions of the left and right resonance states , respectively .",
    "since these states are related by complex conjugation , the procedure described above directly carries over to this representation .",
    "via the resonance wave functions and the associated poincar - husimi and ecs distributions we are now able to study the properties of the resonance states in the 3-disk system both in configuration space and in phase space .",
    "we first verify the observations from quantum maps that long - living and short - living states localize on and off the classical trapped sets , respectively .",
    "we then turn to the correlations of these properties along the resonance chains .",
    "this allows us to identifying a pairwise interaction of chains driven by the interplay of the fundamental periodic orbits .",

    "since we consider the spectrum of the @xmath13 symmetry - reduced 3-disk system , there exist no further symmetries that could be responsible for the crossings of chains .",
    "we already have seen that the states along these chains of long - living states localize in the regions around the fundamental orbits ( see ) .",
    "one reason why the visual impression of these chains is that strong is the fact that the spacing @xmath103 between consecutive resonances in each chain is almost constant , and approximately equal to @xmath104 ( see the middle panel of ) .",
    "this value corresponds to a length of @xmath105 , which has been observed @xcite to coincide well with half the length @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the fundamental periodic orbits in the symmetry - reduced system .",

    "the three resonance states shown there belong to the same ( red ) chain , but localize either on orbit 0 , on orbit 1 , or on both orbits .",
    "thus it is not possible to associate one chain to a single orbit only .    a more detailed inspection of the resonance spacings in supports this observation .",
    "the spacings generally do not coincide exactly with the spacing @xmath108 and @xmath109 expected from the fundamental orbits , but oscillate between these two values , which are indicated by the dashed horizontal lines . only close to the crossings of the red and blue chains do the spacings approach @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "an example of this is the situation at the position of the vertical black line .",
    "the ecs distributions of the states on each chain that are closest to the crossings are shown in .",
    "as already seen in the top and middle panels of , such states are strongly localized on the regions around a fundamental orbit , but now we can confirm that the orbit is selected corresponding to the observed resonance spacing .    at positions where the resonance chains separate from each other ,",
    "the resonance spacings take values in between @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this agrees with the localization pattern observed in the bottom panel of . as a matter of fact",
    ", we see that the spacings themselves form chains and display systematic crossings .",
    "this explains why states on the same chain can be localized on either of the two fundamental orbits ( see again top and middle panels of ) , and indeed suggests the existence of systematic oscillations in the localization pattern .    in order to quantify the localization on the fundamental orbits",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath112 this measures the asymmetry of the projection of the ecs distribution onto the subsets @xmath28 and @xmath27 of the first order trapped set , associated to the orbits 0 and 1 .",
    "the dependence of this quantity on @xmath102 is shown in the bottom panel of .",
    "as expected , near the crossing of resonance chains the asymmetry approaches the extremal values of 0 and 1 , indicating complete localization on @xmath27 or @xmath28 . in between these values",

    "the autocorrelation function @xmath126 starts at a maximum and then displays oscillations that correspond well to the oscillations in , with the first minimum arising at the distance at which the localization pattern of the resonance states shifts between the two fundamental orbits . as expected , the cross - correlation function @xmath127 with the interacting chain shows a complementary oscillatory behavior , while correlations @xmath116 and @xmath117 are small .",
    "so far we focused our discussion on the pairwise interaction of the two chains of longest - living resonances , which are well separated from the other chains for @xmath128 .",
    "however the fact that the level spacing along the chains is approximately constant together with the fractal weyl law predicting an exponent of the counting function strictly greater than one implies that successively more and more chains have to merge from the short living to the long living regime .",
    "such a first merging is observed around @xmath129 from where on all four chains become entangled .",
    "indeed , the interactions become very rich , and it is difficult to uniquely follow the chains through some of the crossings . as seen in , both the resonance spacings as well as the asymmetry of the phase - space localization then display a more erratic behaviour .",
    "the effect on the correlation functions is illustrated in the right panel of , which is obtained from the resonances in the range @xmath119 .",
    "there is an indication of complementary oscillations in the auto - correlation function @xmath126 and the cross - correlation function @xmath117 , while in general the cross - correlations with all the chains are now of similar magnitude .",
    "as the merging of different chains is responsible for the fractal weyl law it should come along with a better resolution of the fractal trapped set and indeed shows that in the regime where the four chains already merged the resonance states on all four chains populate the classical trapped set , and thus can be classified as long - living .",
    "furthermore one observes that these distributions already bend around different regions of the second order trapped set , which is an indication that the phase space resolution at this frequency is already high enough to resolve the second order trapped set .",
    "this increasing population of states on the classical trapped set has been previously observed in quantum maps , where this effect has been identified as the key mechanism behind the fractal weyl law and our observations are a strong indication that this picture applies also to autonomous systems .",
    "however , since quantum maps generally do not display resonance chains , the detailed pathway via the interactions and merging of chains is a unique additional feature of autonomous systems .",
    "in this section we present a quantum graph model which provides a phenomenological explanation of our numerical findings on interacting resonance chains in the 3-disk system , focussing on the regime of pairwise crossings for @xmath130 .",
    "the model can be motivated by inspecting the semiclassical cycle expansion of the zeta function and therefore reproduces the salient features of the resonance spectrum . however , being based on a quantum graph it also allows to extract wave function information , which illuminates the origin of the semiclassical localization on the short periodic orbits and the @xmath14-dependent correlations between the resonance states .",
    "the semiclassical zeta function provides a quantization condition based on the periodic orbits in the system @xcite . in the cycle expansion",
    ", the contributions of these orbits are truncated in a manner which accounts for relations between long orbits and combinations of short orbits in the system .",

    "the principle that the properties of longer orbits are well approximated by combinations of shorter ones is the central idea of the cycle expansion , leading to an extremely fast convergence @xcite .",
    "the zeros of @xmath140 give the semiclassical resonances of the system , which are known @xcite to coincide well with the exact quantum mechanical ones except for the first few ones .",
    "in the right panel of we present the semiclassical resonances for the cycle expansion of second order and find two chains of resonances ( which is connected to the fact that @xmath141 ; see the discussion at the end of this section ) . for @xmath130 , where the two chains of longest - living resonances are isolated from the other resonance chains , we see , as already reported before @xcite , an excellent agreement ( compare ) . for larger",

    "thus , we consider a graph composed of two edges of length @xmath145 and @xmath146 , on which the orbits 0 and 1 are localized ( see ) , connected by a node which approximately combines these orbits into the longer orbit 01 .",
    "the nodes at the left and right ends of the graph describe leakage out of these orbits .",
    "quantum - mechanically , these end nodes are described by reflection coefficients @xmath147 and @xmath148 , while the node connecting both edges can be characterised by a @xmath149 coupling matrix @xmath30 , which can be seen as a subblock of a scattering matrix which includes further leakage out of these periodic orbits .",

    "the matching conditions at the three nodes of the quantum graph read @xmath164 this set of equations admits non - zero solutions only if @xmath14 satisfies @xmath165 leading to the quantization condition of the quantum graph .",
    "we now observe that this condition approximately matches up with the cycle expansion expression . in order to translate between both models",
    "we write @xmath166 and set @xmath167 ( the motivation for this choice is discussed at the end of this section ) .",
    "one then can express all the parameters of the quantum graph in terms of the parameters of the cycle expansion .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath153 , @xmath154 , so that orbit 0 corresponds to running up and down edge 0 , orbit 1 corresponds to running up and down edge 1 , and orbit 01 approximately corresponds to running up and down the whole graph .",
    "furthermore , @xmath168 let us now exploit the implications of the correspondence between the cycle expansion and the quantum graph .",
    "including the full @xmath14-dependence of all parameters , both produce the same resonance spectrum ( see ) .",
    "note that from @xmath169 the function @xmath170 is only slowly varying .",
    "thus it is justified to locally neglect the @xmath14 dependence and approximate @xmath171 .",
    "this approximation would also be the natural choice for the quantum graph model as it corresponds to a @xmath14-independent scattering matrix .",
    "setting @xmath172 to a generic complex value with @xmath173 [ illustrated for @xmath174 in the top panel of ( a ) ] , we can indeed reproduce the typical crossing of resonance chains displayed both by the cycle expansion ( see ) as well as by the full numerical results of the 3-disk system ( see , in the range @xmath175 ) .",
    "furthermore , we also reproduce the oscillations of @xmath176 , with maxima and minima coinciding with the crossings of the chains [ middle panel of ( a ) ] .",
    "this behavior is observed for almost all choices of @xmath172 . only for @xmath177",
    "we observe a deviation from the generic behavior as shown in ( b ) for @xmath178 , where crossings of the chains are now enforced at the crossings of @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the oscillations in the resonance chains is then much reduced , while the amplitude of oscillations in @xmath103 remains the same ( note the different scales in panel ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this effect can also be found in the exact numerical results ( and in the cycle expansion ) in the region @xmath180 , which corresponds to the exceptional value @xmath181 .",
    "the chains of the exact quantum resonances have an extra crossing in this region and smaller oscillation amplitudes while the oscillations in @xmath103 are not affected .",
    "another aspect which sets the quantum graph model apart from the cycle expansion is that it contains information on the resonance wave functions .",
    "this information is extracted by determining the amplitudes @xmath182 from , with @xmath183 set to a solution of the quantization condition .",
    "we normalize the coefficients such that @xmath184 , and then define @xmath185 , @xmath186 as the probabilities to be situated on edge 0 or edge 1 , respectively .",

    "first , we note that the mapping of parameters is not unique ; it relies on our choice to set @xmath167 . with this choice , the reflection coefficients @xmath147 and @xmath148 only depend on the properties of orbit 0 and orbit 1 , respectively , which appears natural as one could consider the limit of a system in which these orbits are independent of each other ( this corresponds to a putative system with @xmath195 , where the two edges are not coupled ) .",
    "this particular choice of @xmath167 also implies , that the scattering matrix between the two edges is not unitary .",
    "recall however , that we only find exact correspondence with the cycle expansion when we take the @xmath14-dependence of the matching coefficients into account .",
    "thus our @xmath14-independent scattering matrix corresponds to an approximation of the scattering matrix which has already been meromorphically continued away from the real axis and it is therefore natural that it is nonunitary . in principle , however , the mapping is not unique , since the parameters in the quantum graph can be scaled as @xmath196 , for some ( possibly complex ) constant @xmath197 , without changing the quantization condition .",
    "the wave amplitudes then scale according to @xmath198 ( modulo overall normalization , @xmath184 ) .",
    "therefore , this freedom only affects the relative weight of the two counter - propagating components on each edge , but does not mix the amplitudes of different edges .",
    "indeed , we verified that the probabilities @xmath187 and the correlations of the husimi function become insensitive to this freedom in the translation once @xmath199 is large , as is the case throughout the region of interest .",
    "secondly , it is worth pointing out that the fact that we describe two interacting resonance chains is not directly related with the existence of two edges in the quantum graph .",
    "the actual origin of the two chains is the fact that @xmath200 . in general , we observe that @xmath201 chains appear when @xmath202 , indicating a surprising richness of the resonances in this simple quantum graph ( see ) . by extension , we would expect to find a similar richness of resonance chains in quantum chaotic systems in which the leading order of the cycle expansion is given by the interaction of two short orbits of approximately commensurable length .",
    "possible candidates fulfilling this requirement are non - symmetric 3-disk systems or schottky surfaces @xcite .",
    "resonance chains of the quantum graph with the same stabilities as in , @xmath203 and @xmath14-independent @xmath174 and different @xmath146 . for @xmath204 ( top ) and @xmath205 ( bottom ) , corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath206 , leading to 3 and 4 chains respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "in this article we linked the properties of interacting resonance chains in an autonomous open quantum - chaotic system , the 3-disk system , to underlying phase space structures consisting of trapped sets and periodic orbits .",
    "this allowed us to show that modulations and correlations of various spectral and spatial properties of the states along the chains arise from the interplay between different periodic orbits .",
    "furthermore , we found first indications that the successive merging of resonance chains in the semiclassical limit , is connected with the increasing phase space resolution of the trapped set , thereby connecting the ubiquitous phenomenon of resonance chains with a fundamental physical mechanism that is also at play in the fractal weyl law .    at the wave numbers accessed in this work ,",
    "only the first order of the trapped set becomes clearly resolved .",
    "it is therefore desirable for future works to delve deeper into the semiclassical limit where higher orders can be resolved . only in this regime one",
    "encounters the full range of questions related to to spectral gaps of semiclassical @xcite and random - matrix @xcite origin ( recently observed in experiments @xcite ) , mode non - orthogonality @xcite ( determining the line widths of microcavity lasers @xcite ) , and local spectral statistics ( presently far better understood in systems that obey random - matrix theory @xcite , which however can not explain the fractal weyl law as it assumes a vanishing ehrenfest time @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , we restricted the analysis of the cycle expansion to the second order in stability and the graph to two edges , which limits our phenomenological analogy with quantum graphs to periodic interactions of chains . finally , it is also desirable to confirm the general picture developed here for other systems , including systems with two fundamental orbits of different near - commensurability for which the simple quantum - graph model already predicts interactions of a larger number of chains .",
