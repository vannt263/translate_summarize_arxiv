    "the first level muon trigger of the atlas experiment  @xcite is based on resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) in the barrel region and thin gap chambers ( tgc ) in the end - cap regions of the muon spectrometer ( ms ) .",
    "they provide high timing resolution for precise bunch crossing identification , but have a limited spatial resolution of a few centimetres resulting in a limited muon momentum resolution .",
    "hence , at most half of the muons with transverse momentum between 10  gev and 20  gev are selected with a nominal trigger threshold of 20  gev . at hl - lhc luminosities , this leads to unacceptably high trigger rates .    in order to reduce the trigger rate ,",
    "the momentum resolution of the first level trigger system has to be increased to the level of the current level-2 trigger resolution based on the monitored drift tubes ( mdt ) tracking chambers  @xcite .",
    "the most efficient solution with the best resolution is to use the mdt chambers at the first trigger level  @xcite .",
    "in order to include the mdt hit information in the first level trigger , a fast mdt read - out has to be implemented . furthermore , a fast track reconstruction algorithm with latency below 6  @xmath0s seeded by the region - of - interest information of the trigger chambers has to be developed .",
    "the track reconstruction has to be performed with high efficiency at high background occupancies of up to 14% expected in the mdt chambers at hl - lhc  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig::technical ] shows the proposed fast mdt read - out scheme .",
    "the digitized drift time measurement of the mdt front - end electronics is sent via the on - chamber data concentrator and a fast read - out path to the trigger logic where fast processors ( socs-``system - on - a - chip '' , fpga - cpu combinations ) are used for hit buffering and track reconstruction .",
    "when the trigger chambers detect a muon candidate , this coarse position information is used for fast track reconstruction within the mdt chambers .",
    "a histogram - based pattern recognition algorithm has been developed for fast track reconstruction  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig::histogram ] ) .",
    "based on the angle of incidence of the muons known with sufficient precision from the trigger chambers ( seed angle ) , the algorithm resolves the ambiguity in the hit positions from the drift radius measurements in the drift tubes and projects the hit coordinates perpendicular to the expected track direction filling a one - dimensional histogram which is scanned for peaks corresponding to track candidates .",
    "a linear track fit is applied to the associated hits and the @xmath1 per degree of freedom of the fit is used as a measure of the fit quality ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the @xmath3-cut leads only to 1.9% efficiency loss , but reduces the fraction of badly reconstructed tracks3  mrad with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) the reconstructed ( true ) track angles . ] by 23% .    in order not to wrongly reject energetic muons , events without a track fulfilling the requirements ( less than 10% )",
    "are always accepted and the transverse momentum is determined and selected at a higher trigger level  @xcite .",
    "0.45     0.45     in order to test the trigger concept and to study the fast track reconstruction algorithm , a hardware demonstrator has been constructed and used for fast reconstruction of cosmic muon tracks in an mdt chamber under @xmath6 irradiation at the cern gamma irradiation facility ( gif ) .",
    "the trigger demonstrator comprises two parallel read - out chains for data with high and with reduced time resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::technical ] ) .    the residual distribution of the incidence angle @xmath4 of the fast reconstructed tracks with respect to the offline reconstructed angle @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::results ] and is in agreement with the geant4  @xcite simulation of the demonstrator test set - up . due to the preliminary long dead time",
    "( 1500  ns ) of the fast read - out , the fraction of tracks with a small number of hits is enhanced leading to a higher uncertainty in the track fit .",
    "therefore , the fraction of wrongly reconstructed tracks with @xmath83  mrad is 10.2% at the maximum expected background rate at hl - lhc . for the implementation in atlas , a dead time of 200  ns is envisaged to reduce the fraction to 1% .",
    "the fast tracking algorithm has been implemented in assembler language on an arm cortex - m4f cpu , commonly used in socs .",
    "the processing times of the reconstruction algorithm for the data taken at the gif are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::timing ] . with the highest clock frequency ( 200  mhz )",
    ", the track can be reconstructed within 11  @xmath0s . the use of a more advanced cpu architecture ( e.g. arm cortex - a9 implemented on xilinx zynq soc ) allowing a reduction of the maximum processing time below the expected first - level trigger latency of 6  @xmath0s at hl - lhc .",
    "in order to improve the transverse momentum resolution and the acceptance of the atlas muon trigger at hl - lhc , the mdt precision tracking chambers will be included in the first level muon trigger with a foreseen latency of 6  @xmath0s .",
    "performance studies with a hardware implementation of the required new fast read - out of the mdt chambers and of the fast tracking algorithm demonstrate the feasibility of the concept ."
