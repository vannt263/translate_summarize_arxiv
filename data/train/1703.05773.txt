    "when a star passes within a tidal radius of a supermassive blackhole ( smbh ) , it will be torn apart by tidal forces .",
    "about half of the debris from the disruption is accreted by the central blackhole , generating luminous flares in the soft x - ray , uv and optical wavelengths , lasting a few months to years @xcite .",
    "a dozen tdes have been reported so far from transient surveys or serendipitous observations from x - ray to optical ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "tdes serve as a powerful probe of the blackhole accretion process itself .",
    "in addition , they offer an unique opportunity to study interstellar medium ( ism ) within a few parsecs surrounding quiescent smbhs .",
    "the uv and soft x - ray flares from tdes can ionize gas medium , and the subsequent recombination produces spectral signatures .",
    "these spectral features are detected as transient extreme coronal lines , variable [ o iii ] lines , or broad transient heii and h@xmath8 lines @xcite .",
    "when dust is present , uv / optical photons from tdes are expected to be absorbed and re - emitted in the infrared .",
    "this dust emission is predicted to peak at 3 - 10@xmath9 m with an infrared luminosity of 10@xmath10ergs@xmath3 , and last for a few years for a typical tde @xcite .",
    "such infrared emission has been detected for the first time recently in tdes and tde candidates with transient coronal emission lines @xcite using archival data from _ wide field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( wise ) @xcite .",
    "so far most tdes are found among normal post - starburst galaxies , whose star formation has been recently shut - off @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite recently reported the first case of a tde candidate among an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) f01004 - 2237 at @xmath11 .",
    "they found a luminous optical flare with a @xmath12ergs@xmath3 and the peak date of @xmath1355490days ( 2010-june-25 ) using the data from the catalina sky survey ( css , @xcite ) . following the optical flare , broad heii emission lines ,",
    "were also detected in f01004 - 2237 @xcite , which have been considered as the hallmarks of tdes discovered from optical transient surveys @xcite .",
    "in addition , the estimated blackhole mass is @xmath14 @xcite . based on these characteristics ,",
    "this optical flare was classified as a tde candidate ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2017 ) .",
    "this tde candidate is unusual .",
    "first , the host galaxy has sfr @xmath15 with massive young , wr stars in its compact nucleus @xcite . both optical spectral line ratios and _ spitzer _ mir spectra suggest that it is a seyfert 2 galaxy with a very dusty active galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "second , the optical lc has an unusually long decay time scale .",
    "furthermore , three years after the peak , the lc did not fade back to its quiescent state , instead it levels off and is about 0.1 magnitude brighter .",
    "these unusual features cast many questions as to the true nature of this event .",
    "could the optical flare be simply active agn variability ?",
    "is it possible that broad heii lines could be the result of variable accretion rates ?    in this paper , we report the mid - infrared flare detected in f01004 - 2237 3 years after the optical peak date .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 m lcs are currently still rising .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mid - infrared light curves and results is described in section 2 .",
    "we discussed the results and concluded in section 3 and 4 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath16 cosmology with @xmath17=0.3 , @xmath18=0.7 , and a hubble constant of @xmath19=70@xmath20 .",
    "the primary _ wise _ survey ended on feb 1 , 2011 when _ wise _ was put into hibernation @xcite .",
    "the _ near earth object wide - field infrared survey explorer reactivation _ survey ( neowise - r ) began on dec 13 , 2013 .",
    "there are @xmath21 years gap between _ wise _ and _ neowise - r_. we extract a total of nine epoch mid - ir photometry from the _ wise _ archive .",
    "there are 10 - 20 exposures in each epoch .",
    "we use only the best quality single frame images with ` qual@xmath22@xmath230 ' .",
    "this leave 9 - 17 exposures for each epoch .",
    "f01004 - 2237 is a point - like source in all of the _ wise _ images .",
    "checking for potential contamination , we do not find any other sources within 10 . at each epoch , we do not find short - term variabilities .",
    "we then average these magnitudes to obtain a mean value at each epoch .",
    "we checked the mir lcs of 3 other point sources close to our target , and no variabilities are detected from them .",
    "the w1 and w2 band lcs are shown in figure[fig : lcs ] .",

    "this implies that f01004 - 2237 is in a quiescent state at the first two epochs . the averaged brightness at @xmath0 and @xmath1 m are @xmath27 and @xmath28magnitude .",
    "when f01004 - 2237 was re - observed during _",
    "neowise - r _ survey @xmath21 years after the peak of optical flare , it was already 0.83 and 0.64 mag brighter in w1 and w2 bands , compared with the quiescent state .",
    "the source has been brightening steadily up to december 13 of 2016 ( the last epoch in figure [ fig : lcs ] ) . over the course of @xmath13 6 years after the optical flare",
    ", the @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes have brightened by 1.35 and 1.06 mag , respectively . after subtracting the quiescent flux",
    ", we show the mid - ir lcs in the upper panel of figure [ fig : excesslum ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show the light - curve of v band after subtraction of the constant component defined by pre - flare luminosity .",
    "the host subtracted , maximum mir luminosity with the available data is @xmath31 and @xmath32ergs@xmath3 at @xmath0 and @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "this is a factor of 6 higher than the peak luminosity of the optical flare ( host subtracted ) . the strong silicate absorption in the pre - flare _ spitzer _ mir spectrum indicates this is a dust heavily obscured syefert 2 galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the optical luminosity is likely under - estimated .",

    "middle panel : evolution of the ratio of host subtracted flux between w1 and w2 band .",
    "the yellow dash line is the mean level .",
    "lower panel : evolution of the dust temperature .",
    "[ fig : excesslum],scaledwidth=100.0% ]      with infrared fluxes only in the w1 and w2 bands , we rely on models to estimate dust temperature and luminosity . for simplicity , we consider single temperature dust consisting of either astronomical silicate ( si for short ) or silicon carbide ( sic ) with three different grain sizes , 0.01 , 0.1 and 1@xmath9 m",
    ". the optical and thermal properties of the dust is taken from @xcite . applying these models to the host subtracted w1 and w2 light curves , we estimate dust temperature and luminosity in 1 - 10@xmath9 m at each epoch ( see also figure  [ fig : excesslum ] ) . in summary ,",
    "the estimated dust temperatures is in narrow range of 590 - 850 k ; and the dust luminosities is in a narrow range of @xmath33ergs@xmath3 , at the last epoch .",
    "the inferred temperature and luminosity depends on the grain composition and size .",
    "interesting , we find that the ratio of the host subtracted fluxes between w1 and w2 band during the _ neowise - r _ survey remains constant , if considering the uncertainty",
    ". the mean ratio is @xmath34 ( middel panel of figure [ fig : excesslum ] ) .",
    "the inferred dust temperature also remains constant ( lower panel of figure [ fig : excesslum ] ) , which is consistent with the ratio of the host subtracted fluxes , despite 0.3 dex increase in the dust luminosity .",
    "in extragalactic , infrared variable sources can be categorized into two groups : non - thermal emission from relativistic jets such as blazars , and thermal dust emission as in radio quiet agns and tdes ( wang et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) . since f01004 - 2237 is radio quiet , we will consider only thermal dust emission .",
    "a uv flare , regardless its origin as a changing - look agn or a tde , will cause a response in mir emission if there is dust around the blackhole .",
    "this is so called infrared echo . however , the mir light - curve of f01004 - 2237 looks quite different from those of other tdes / tde candidates @xcite .",
    "the question here is under what conditions that we may see a light - curve like this .",
    "first , there is no significant mir excess above the pre - flare level at 60 days after the optical flare . in other words ,",
    "the uv / optical photons from the flare had not been reprocessed by dust in 60 days .",
    "this implies that there must be very little dust reprocessing the uv flare along the line - of - sight within a radius of 30-light days from the optical flare source ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) . ] .",
    "lack of dust within the radius of 30-light days at the peak of optical flare is expected because the dust sublimation radius is @xmath35-light day when the peak luminosity of the optical flare exceeding @xmath36ergs@xmath3erg s@xmath37 @xcite . ] .",
    "second , our modeling of the data shows that the dust temperature remains roughly constant , suggesting that uv radiation intensity from the central source is also roughly the same .",
    "since the optical flare lasts a much shorter time scale than that of mir lc , we can simplify and consider the optical flare as a pulse .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the dust distribution must be in a ring shape with equal distances to the central heating source .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , when the uv photons from the central source travel further out , they reach more and more surface areas of the dust torus , heating up more dust and producing a rising mir lcs . if this dusty ring is viewed at an intermediate angle , it may explain lack of delay at less than 60 days and at the same time reproduce the continuous rise of mir flux .",
    "this was demonstrated by the similar double - horn transfer function for an inclined ring calculated for broad line reverberation mapping study @xcite .",
    "these horns are separated by @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the radius of the ring .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have early stage mir light curve , but one prediction of the model is that mir flux will turn over sharply after certain time , that can be tested with future mir observations .",
    "the size of ring is at least 3 light years , but not much longer , in order to match the light - curve .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    another interesting inference with dust reprocessing scenario is the prediction of dust echo signature ( reflection component ) in both the optical and uv band .",
    "if dust composition and grain size are uniform over the region , we expect that the scattered optical flux is roughly proportional to that of reprocessed infrared light .",
    "the fraction of scattered light depends on the albedo of the dust , which is a strong function of grain size .",
    "grains of size @xmath40 m will give strong reflection light up to 1 @xmath9 m . with a reasonable albedo of dust in v band ( @xmath130.5 , laor & draine 1993 ) and optical to uv light ratio of incident continuum ( @xmath130.2 ) ,",
    "scattered optical flux would be order of 10% of infrared flux .",
    "this is sufficient to explain the puzzling up - rise in the optical light curve several years after the optical flare .",
    "dust grains can be considered as bolometers due to large absorption cross section in uv .",
    "their temperature is determined by the incident uv flux . to compute the bolometric luminosity of the central flare source ,",
    "we need estimates of its uv luminosity .",
    "this can be inferred from dust temperature and distance from the uv source . as discussed in last section ,",
    "the heated dust is likely in a convex surface with a distance to the uv source of at least 3 light years . using the formula(1 - 3 ) in @xcite and",
    "adopt @xmath41 from @xcite , one can estimate the peak uv luminosity .    for si grains ,",
    "the peak uv luminosity calculated from data of the last epoch is in range of 0.17 - 12.6@xmath42ergs@xmath3 , depending on the grain size .",
    "the value will be @xmath130.2 dex larger for the sic grain .",
    "once we have the falling part of the mid - infrared light - curve in future , we will give a better estimate of the size of dust ring . if we can get the infrared spectrum",
    ", we will constrain the dust properties . these will lead a better estimate of the peak uv luminosity .",
    "we calculate the total energy emitted in the infrared flare by integrating the host subtracted light - curve . during the period of _ neowise - r _ survey , f01004 - 2237 has emitted a total energy about @xmath43 erg in the infrared .",
    "roughly , this is comparable to the energy released by a tidal disruption of a @xmath44 star proposed by @xcite assuming a half of the debris is accreted and a typical radiation efficiency of @xmath45 .",
    "given the fact that we missed the early rising part of the light curve , and the source is still brightening in mir , the above energy is a lower limit .",
    "this suggests that the disrupted star is likely to be more massive .",
    "we estimate the heated dust mass at each epoch using the formula(8 - 9 ) in @xcite , adopted @xmath46 for si .",
    "the heated dust mass is @xmath47 at the last epoch . according to our model ,",
    "the dust was heated and emit mir for a period of the duration of optical flare and then cool down .",
    "so the total amount of dust is @xmath5 , if assuming the optical flare time scale is one year @xcite .",
    "we discover a strong infrared echo of the optical flare from the tde candidate in ulirg f01004 - 2237 using archival _",
    "wise _ and _ neowise _ data .",
    "the target is mir quiescent during the peak of the optical flare at 2010 .",
    "however , 3 years after the optical peak , we find steady rise in mir emission , with fluxes increasing by a factor of 3.4 , 2.6 at @xmath0 and @xmath1 m respectively .",
    "the peak mir luminosity are @xmath48 and @xmath49ergs@xmath3 in w1 and w2 band , respectively , which are about 0.7 - 0.8 dex higher than the observed peak flare luminosity at in v band . despite the infrared luminosity continuously risen by a factor of 2 in the past three years , our model suggests that the temperature remained at a constant of 600 - 800 k. we estimate mir energy radiated during between 2013 - 2016 to be @xmath50 ergs .",
    "we interpret the variable infrared emission in the context of thermal dust emission in response to the uv / optical flare , presumably caused by a tde . a thick dusty ring of size of about 1 parsec and mass of about @xmath51 around the black hole at an intermediate inclination angle may be able to reproduce all characteristics in the observed mir light curve . as a byproduct ,",
    "the model predicts a sharp decrease of the mir flux not too far in the future , which can be verified by future photometric monitoring , and an optical component due to dust scattering of the primary uv / optical flare at a level 10% of the infrared luminosity , which may explain the very flat optical light - curve at very late stage and can be tested with polarization observation .",
