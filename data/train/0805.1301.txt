    "however , the notion of a pre - hypergraph turns out to be more natural in the context of the polytopes and linear codes that we consider below .    given a hypergraph , we define the associated interaction space by @xmath37 note that , since a function that depends only on its arguments in @xmath38 , only depends on its arguments in @xmath39 , it suffices to consider the inclusion maximal elements in @xmath30 . we denote them by @xmath40 and have @xmath41 we consider the corresponding exponential family :    the _ hierarchical model _ assigned to the hypergraph @xmath30 is the exponential family @xmath42    we give two examples for hypergraphs :    [ graphmod]@xmath43 + * ( 1 ) graphical models : * let @xmath44 be an undirected graph , and define @xmath45 here , a _ clique _ is a set @xmath46 that satisfies the following property : @xmath47 the exponential family @xmath48 is characterized by markov properties with respect to @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) . +",

    "we have defined a corresponding hierarchy of exponential families studied in @xcite : @xmath54    the elements of this hierarchy have nice interpretations .",

    "different representations of exponential families have been considered , each of which has its own benefits and highlights different aspects .",
    "we will review a number of these representations .",
    "the particular choice of parity functions will allow us to make a link to coding theory .    as we have introduced exponential families ,",
    "the key concept is the interaction space @xmath77 which is sometimes also called tangent space to the exponential family .",
    "this space completely characterizes the exponential family .",

    "in particular , they have the same face lattice .    the polytope @xmath87 encodes in its face lattice the combinatorial structure of the exponential family in the sense that a knowledge of the face lattice gives precise knowledge about the supports of elements in the closure of the exponential family .",
