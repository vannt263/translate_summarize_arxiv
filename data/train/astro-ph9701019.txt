    "the success of population and evolutionary synthesis calculations of the integrated light of clusters and galaxies critically depends on the availability of a suitable library of stellar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which we shall henceforth call _ stellar library_. because of the complex nature of the subject , there are very many ways in which such calculations can contribute to the solution of any particular question relevant to the stellar populations and their evolution in clusters and galaxies . in previous studies ,",
    "the particularities of these questions have largely determined the properties that the corresponding stellar library must have in order to be considered _",
    "suitable _ for the purpose .",
    "there is now a considerable arsenal of observed stellar libraries ( for a recent compilation , see e.g. leitherer _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , each of which has its particular resolution , coverage , and range of wavelengths as well as its particular coverage and range of stellar parameters  but which , even if taken in the aggregate , fall short by far of providing the _ uniform , homogeneous , and complete _ stellar library which is required now for a more systematic and penetrating exploitation of _ photometric _ population and evolutionary synthesis .",
    "ultimately for this purpose , what is needed is a uniform , homogeneous , and complete _ theoretical _ stellar library , providing seds in terms of physical parameters consistent with empirical calibrations at all accessible wavelengths .",
    "thus , the above goal can be approached by merging existing grids of theoretical model ",
    "atmosphere spectra into the desired uniform and complete stellar library , and making it both homogeneous and realistic by _ empirical calibration_.    a variant of this approach was first tried by buser & kurucz ( 1992 ) , who constructed a more complete theoretical stellar library for o through k stars by merging the o  g  star grids of kurucz ( 1979a ,",
    "b ) with the grids of gustafsson _ et al . _",
    "( 1975 ) , bell _ et al . _ ( 1976 ) , and eriksson _ et al . _ ( 1979 ) for f  k stars . in their paper ,",
    "buser & kurucz solved for uniformity and homogeneity by recomputing new late ",
    "type spectra for kurucz s ( 1979 ) standard grid of wavelengths and using the kurucz & peytremann ( 1975 ) atomic opacity source tables .",
    "the resulting hybrid library has , indeed , significantly expanded the ranges of stellar parameters and wavelengths for which _ synthetic photometry _ can be obtained with useful systematic accuracy and consistent with essential empirical effective temperature and metallicity calibrations ( buser & fenkart 1990 , buser & kurucz 1992 , lejeune & buser 1996 ) .    in the meantime , kurucz ( 1992 , 1995 ) has provided a highly comprehensive library of theoretical stellar seds which is homogeneously based on the single extended grid of model atmospheres for o to late ",
    "k stars calculated from the latest version of his atlas code and using his recent multi  million atomic and molecular line lists .",
    "the new kurucz grid  as we shall call it henceforth  indeed goes a long way toward the _ complete library _ matching the basic requirements imposed by synthetic photometry studies in population and evolutionary synthesis .",
    "as summarized in table 1 below , seds are provided for uniform grids of wavelengths and stellar parameters with almost complete coverage of their observed ranges !",
    "these data have already been widely used by the astronomical community , and they will doubtlessly continue to prove an indispensable database for population and evolutionary synthesis work for years to come .    in the present work , we shall endeavor to provide yet another indispensable step toward a _ more complete _ stellar library by extending the new kurucz grid to _",
    "cooler temperatures_. this extension is particularly important for the synthesis of old stellar populations , where _ cool giants and supergiants _ may contribute a considerable fraction of the total integrated light . because model atmospheres and flux spectra for such stars  the m stars  have been specifically calculated by bessell _",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) and by fluks _",
    "( 1994 ) , our task will mainly be to combine these with the new kurucz grid by transformation to the same uniform set of wavelengths , and to submit the resulting library to extensive tests for its realism .",
    "in fact , as shall be shown below , the process will provide a complete grid of seds which is homogeneously and consistently _ calibrated against observed colors _ at most accessible wavelengths .    in sect .",
    "2 , we shall briefly describe the different libraries used in this paper and the main problems that they pose to their unification . because the spectra exhibit systematic differences both between their parent libraries and relative to observations , we set up , in sect .",
    "3 , the basic empirical color  temperature relations to be used for uniformly calibrating the library spectra in a wide range of broad  band colors .",
    "this calibration process is driven by a computer algorithm developed and described in sect .",
    "4 . the actual color  temperature relations obtained from the corrected library spectra",
    "are discussed in sect . 5 , and the final organization of the library grid is presented in sect .",
    "6 . in the concluding sect",
    ". 7 , we summarize the present state of this work toward the intended _",
    "standard library _ , and we briefly mention those necessary steps which are currently in process to this end .",
    "the different libraries used are from kurucz ( 1995 ) , bessell _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) , and fluks _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 )  which we shall henceforth call the k , b , and f  libraries , respectively . although the k  library covers a very wide temperature range ( from @xmath0=50,000 k to 3500 k ) , it does not extend to the very low temperatures required to model cool agb stars .",
    "these stars are very important for population and evolutionary synthesis , since they can represent up to 40% of the bolometric and even up to 60% of the k  band luminosity of a single stellar generation ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "it is natural , then , to provide the necessary supplement by employing the suitable libraries that were specifically calculated for m  giant stars in the temperature range 38002500 k by bessell _",

    "i , and the two  color relations established by fitzgerald ( 1970 ) , bessell ( 1979 ) , and bb88 were then used to derive the temperature scales for the remaining colors .",
    "this procedure should provide color  temperature calibrations with uncertainties of @xmath11 0.05 mag in color or @xmath11 200 k in temperature ( buser & kurucz 1992 ) .        in order to compare the models to the above color  temperature relations for red giants ,",
    "model spectra were first interpolated in the theoretical libraries for appropriate values of surface gravity given by the log g@xmath5 relation defined by the @xmath12 evolutionary track from schaller _",
    "synthetic colors computed from these model spectra are then directly compared to the empirical color  temperature relations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it is evident that the color differences between equivalent models from the k and the b+f  libraries can be as high as _ 0.4 mag _ , while those between the theoretical library spectra and the empirical calibrations may be even larger , up to _",
    "1 mag_.    such differences  both between the original libraries and between these and the empirical calibrations  make it clear that direct use of these original theoretical data in population and evolutionary synthesis is bound to generate a great deal of confusion in the interpretation of results .",
    "in particular , applications to the integrated light of galaxies at faint magnitude levels , where effects of cosmological redshift may come into play as well , will provide rather limited physical insight unless the basic building blocks of the evolutionary synthesis  i.e. , the stellar spectra",
    " are systematically consistent with the best available observational evidence .",
    "thus , our work is driven by the",
    "_ systematic consistency of theoretical stellar colors and empirical calibrations _ as a minimum requirement for the ( future ) _ standard library_. as a viable operational step in this direction , a suitable _ correction procedure for the theoretical spectra _ will be developed in the following section .",
    "the same procedure as for the giants was applied for the main sequence stars , except that a zero  age main sequence isochrone ( zams ) compiled by bruzual ( 1995 ) was used in the appropriate interpolation for the surface gravity log g. again , synthetic photometry results obtained from the theoretical library ( kurucz ) are compared to the empirical color  temperature relations in fig . 7 .",
    "note that the differences between the theoretical and the empirical colors are significantly smaller than those for the giants given in fig . 6",
    ": for the hotter temperatures , they do not exceed 0.1 mag .",
    ", while at cooler temperatures ( @xmath13 k ) differences of up to 0.3 mag in v ",
    "i between models and observations again indicate that the coolest k  library spectra still carry large uncertainties and should , therefore , be used with caution ( e.g. , buser & kurucz 1992 ) .",
    "thus , application of the same correction procedure as for the giant models appears warranted for the dwarf models as well .",
    "also note that the kurucz spectra only go down to 3500k .",
    "we are thus missing the low ",
    "luminosity , low  temperature main sequence m stars in the present library .",
    "however , we anticipate here that in a corollary paper ( lejeune _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , hereafter paper ii ) the necessary extension is being provided from a similar treatment of the comprehensive grid of m  star model spectra published by allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) .",
    "we now establish a correction procedure _ for the library spectra _ which preserves their detailed features but modifies their continua in such a way that the synthetic colors from the corrected library spectra conform to the empirical color  temperature relations . since the empirical color ",
    "temperature relations do not provide direct access to the stellar continua , pseudo  continua are instead being calculated for each temperature from both the empirical ( table 2 ) and the theoretical ( model  generated ) colors .",
    "the ratio between the two pseudo  continua then provides the desired _ correction function _ for the given @xmath5 .      for a given stellar flux spectrum of effective temperature @xmath14",
    ", we define the pseudo ",
    "continua @xmath15 as black bodies of color temperature @xmath16 varying with wavelength :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a scale factor and @xmath19 is the black body function , both of which need to be determined by least",
    " squares fits of @xmath15 to the broad  band fluxes of the given flux spectrum .",
    "thus ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the normalized transmission function of the passband @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the broad  band flux measured through this passband .",
    "because colors are relative measurements , we normalize by arbitrarily setting the absolute flux in the i  band to be equal to 100 : @xmath24 the black  body fit in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) is then obtained iteratively by a conjugate gradients method .",
    "8 illustrates a typical result .",
    "note that , because effects of blanketing are ignored by this fitting procedure , the mean temperature , @xmath25 , associated with the best  fitting black  body curve , is systematically lower than the effective temperature of the actual flux spectrum .",
    "+    @xmath18 having thus been determined , the color temperatures , @xmath26 , can be derived in a straightforward manner at the mean wavelengths of a filter of transmission function @xmath21 is defined in the following way : @xmath27 ] @xmath28 of the passbands @xmath22 via the equations :    @xmath29    interpolation between the @xmath28 by a spline function finally provides the continuous ( and smooth ) color temperatures @xmath16 ( fig .",

    "corrected spectra , @xmath34 , are then calculated from the original library spectra , @xmath35 : + @xmath36 + note that the correction defined in this way becomes an additive constant on a logarithmic , or magnitude scale .",
    "therefore , at each effective temperature the original monochromatic magnitude differences between model library spectra having different metallicities [ m / h ] and/or different surface gravities log g are conserved after correction . as we shall see below , this will be true to good approximation even for the heterochromatic broad  band magnitudes and colors because , as shown in fig .",
    "12 , the wavelength ",
    "dependent correction functions do not , in general , exhibit dramatically changing amplitudes within the passbands . + fig .",
    "11 shows how the resulting correction functions change with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "12 and 13 display the corresponding effective temperature sequence of original and corrected spectra at different metallicities for the full ( fig . 12 ) and the visible ( fig .",
    "13 ) wavelength ranges , respectively .",
    "finally , the normalization of fluxes in the i  band , @xmath37 , adopted initially for calculating the pseudo ",
    "continua must be cancelled now in order to restore the effective temperature scale .",
    "thus , each corrected spectrum of the library , @xmath38 is scaled by a constant factor , @xmath39 , to give the final corrected spectrum @xmath40 : + @xmath41 + where + @xmath42 + assures that the emergent integral flux of the final corrected spectrum conforms to the definition of the effective temperature ( eqn .",
    ".    the final corrected spectra are thus in a format which allows immediate applications in population evolutionary synthesis . for a stellar model of given mass , metallicity , and age , the radius @xmath43",
    "is determined by calculations of its evolutionary track in the theoretical hr diagram , and the total emergent flux at each wavelength can hence be obtained from the present library spectra via    @xmath44",
    "we now discuss the properties of the new library spectra which result from the correction algorithm developed above , and which are most important in the context of population and evolutionary synthesis .",
    "14 illustrates the @xmath14color relations obtained after correction of the giant sequence spectra from the k and b+f  libraries .",
    "comparison with the corresponding fig . 6 for the uncorrected spectra shows that the original differences which existed both between overlapping spectra of the two libraries _ and _ between the synthetic and empirical relations have indeed almost entirely been eliminated",
    ". while remaining differences between libraries are negligible , those between theoretical and empirical relations are below 0.1 mag .",
    "15 illustrates similar results for the main sequence .",
    "again , comparison with the corresponding fig . 7 before correction shows that the present calibration algorithm provides theoretical color  temperature relations which are in almost perfect agreement with the empirical data .",
    "thus at this point , we can say that for solar abundances , the new library provides purely synthetic giant and dwarf star spectra that in general fit empirical color  temperature calibrations to within better than 0.1 mag over significant ranges of wavelengths and temperatures , and even to within a few hundredths of a magnitude for the hotter temperatures , @xmath45 .",
    "bolometric corrections , @xmath46 , are indispensable for the direct conversion of the theoretical hr diagram , @xmath47 , into the observational color  absolute magnitude diagram , @xmath48 :    @xmath49    where the bolometric magnitude ,    @xmath50    provides the direct link to the effective temperature ( scale ) . of course",
    ", bolometric corrections applying to any other ( arbitrary ) passbands are then consistently calculated from @xmath51 , where the color @xmath52 is synthesized from the corrected library spectra .",
    "16 provides a representative plot of bolometric corrections , @xmath46 , for solar  abundance dwarf model spectra .",
    "the arbitrary constant in eq .",
    "11 has been defined in order to fix to zero the smallest bolometric correction ( buser & kurucz 1978 ) found for the non - corrected models , which gives @xmath53 .",
    "comparison with the empirical calibration given by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) demonstrates that the present correction algorithm is reliable in this respect , too : predictions everywhere agree with the empirical data to within @xmath54  which is excellent .",
    "similar tests for the giant models also indicate that the correction procedure provides theoretical bolometric corrections in better agreement with the observations .",
    "these results will be discussed in a subsequent paper based on a more systematic application to multicolor data for cluster and field stars ( lejeune _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "since comprehensive empirical calibration data have only been available for the full temperature sequences of solar  abundance giant and dwarf stars , _ direct _ calibration of the present library spectra using these data has , by necessity , also been limited to _",
    "solar  abundance _ models .",
    "however , because one of the principal purposes of the present work has been to make available theoretical flux spectra covering a wide _ range in metallicities _ , it is important that the present calibration for solar  abundance models be propagated consistently into the remaining library spectra for parameter values ranging outside those represented by the calibration sequences .",
    "we thus have designed our correction algorithm in such a way as to _ preserve , at each temperature , the monochromatic flux ratios between the original spectra for different metallicities [ m / h ] and/or surface gravities log g_. justification of this procedure comes from the fact that , if used differentially , most modern _ grids of model  atmosphere spectra _ come close to reproducing observed stellar properties with relatively high systematic accuracy over wide ranges in physical parameters ( e.g. , buser & kurucz 1992 , lejeune & buser 1996 ) .    in order to check the extent to which preservation of monochromatic fluxes propagates into the broad  band colors , we have calculated the differential colors due to metallicity differences between models of the same effective temperature and surface gravity :    @xmath55})=c_{j,[m / h]}-c_{j,[m / h]=0 } , j=1, ... ,8.\\ ] ]    we can then calculate the residual color differences between the corrected and the original grids :    @xmath56}))=      \\delta(c_{j,[m / h]}^{corr})-\\delta(c_{j,[m / h]}^{orig}).\\ ] ]    results are presented in figs .",
    "17 and 18 for the coolest k  library models @xmath57 and for the b+f  library models for m giants @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "residuals are plotted as a function of the model number , which increases with both surface gravity and effective temperature , as given in the calibration sequences .",
    "the different lines represent different metallicities , @xmath59 \\leq + 1.0 $ ] , as explained in the captions .",
    "the most important conclusion is that , in general , the correction algorithm does not alter the original differential grid properties significantly for most colors and most temperatures  in fact , the residuals are smaller than only a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "typically , the largest residuals are found for the coolest temperatures @xmath60 and the shortest  wavelength colors , ubvri , where the correction functions of fig .",
    "11 show the largest variations not only between the different passbands , but also _ within the individual passbands_. this changes their _ effective wavelengths _ and , hence , the baselines defining the color scales ( cf .",
    "buser 1978 ) .",
    "since this effect tends to grow with the width of the passband , it is mainly the coincidence of large changes in both amplitudes _ and _ slopes of the correction functions with the wide  winged r  band which causes residuals for the r - i colors to be relatively large in fig .",
    "calculations of color effects induced by _ surface gravity changes _ lead to similar results .",
    "this corroborates our conclusion that the present correction algorithm indeed provides a new model spectra library which essentially incorporates , to within useful accuracy for the purpose , the currently best knowledge of fundamental stellar properties : a full  range color  calibration in terms of _ empirical _ effective temperatures at solar abundances ( where comprehensive calibration data exist ) * and * a systematic grid of differential colors predicted by the original _ theoretical _ model  atmosphere calculations for the full ranges of metallicities and surface gravities ( where empirical data are still too scarce to allow comprehensive grid calibration ) .    of course , we are aware that the present correction algorithm becomes increasingly inadequate with the complexity of the stellar spectra growing with decreasing temperature and/or increasing surface gravity and metallicity . for example , because under these conditions the highly _ nonlinear _ effects of blanketing due to line saturation and crowding and broad  band molecular absorption tend to dominate the behavior of stellar colors , particularly at shorter ( i.e. , visible ) wavelengths , even the corresponding differential colors can not either be recovered in a physically consistent manner by a simple linear model such as the present . however , the limits of this approach will be further explored in paper ii , where the calibration of theoretical spectra for m  dwarfs will be attempted by introducing the conservation of original differential colors of grid spectra _ as a constraint _ imposed to the correction algorithm .",
    "the corrected spectra have finally been composed into the unified library shown in fig . 19 . in this library ,",
    "model spectra are given for a parameter grid which is uniformly sampled in @xmath14 , log g , and [ m / h ] , each spectrum being available for the same wavelength grid , ( @xmath61 ) , with a medium resolution of   1020  .",
    "the main body consists of the k ",
    "library , which provides the most extensive coverage of parameter space ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) down to @xmath62 , and which has therefore been fully implemented to this limit .",
    "the extensions to lower temperatures , @xmath63 , and associated lower surface gravities , @xmath64 , are provided by the m  giant spectra from the b+f  library , which , however , covers only the limited metallicity range @xmath65 \\geq -1.0 $ ] .",
    "this unified library is available ( in electronic form ) at the cds , strasbourg , france , where it can be obtained in either of two versions , with the _ corrected _ * or * the _ original uncorrected _ spectra from the k and b+f  libraries .",
    "although astronomers have for a long time agreed that a uniform , complete , and realistic stellar library is urgently needed , it must be emphasized that this goal has remained too ambitious to be achieved in a single concerted effort through the present epoch .",
    "we have thus attempted to proceed in well  defined steps , with priorities set according to the availability of basic data and following the most obvious scientific questions that would likely become more tractable , or even answerable .",
    "therefore , we briefly review the present achievement to clarify its status in the ongoing process toward a future _ standard library _ of theoretical stellar spectra for photometric evolutionary synthesis .    1 .   * completeness . *",
    "the unification of the massive k ",
    "library spectra with those for high luminosity m  star models ( the b+f  library ) is most important , because even as a small minority of the number population of a given stellar system , the late  type giants and supergiants may provide a large fraction of this system s integrated light at visible and infrared wavelengths .",

    "while the k , b , and f  libraries have been used to remedy incompleteness ( in either wavelength or parameter coverage , or both ) of available _ observed _ stellar libraries before ( e.g. , worthey 1992 , 1994 ; fioc & rocca  volmerange 1996 ) , our first goal here has been to join them as a purely _ theoretical _ library , providing the main advantages of physical homogeneity and definition in terms of fundamental stellar parameters  which allows direct use with stellar evolutionary calculations . + but even so",
    ", the present library remains incomplete in several respects .",
    "first , stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. , green _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) predict that high  luminosity stars with temperatures near or below @xmath66 may also exist at low metallicities , @xmath67 \\sim -1.0 $ ] , and their flux contributions at visible  near ultraviolet wavelengths ( where metallicity produces significant effects ) may not quite be negligible in the integrated light of old stellar populations .",

    "_ 1997 ) will replace the current hybrid b+f spectra and make the next library version more homogeneous .",
    "+ secondly , even though the low  temperature , low  luminosity m  dwarf stars do not contribute significantly to the integrated bolometric flux , they are not negligible in the determination of mass  to  light ratios in stellar populations .",
    "thus , a suitable grid of ( theoretical ) m  dwarf spectra calculated by allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) is being subjected to a similar calibration process ( paper ii ) and will be implemented in the present library as an important step toward the intended _",
    "standard stellar library_. + finally , the libraries of synthetic spectra for hot o and wr  stars which were recently calculated by schmutz _ et al . _",

    "photometric evolutionary synthesis ",

    "+ because the original library spectra do not meet the above minimum requirement ( sect .",

    "however , we have also shown that the present algorithm provides the desired broad  band ( or pseudo  continuum ) color calibration _ without _ destroying the original relative monochromatic fluxes between arbitrary model grid spectra and solar  abundance calibration sequence spectra of the same effective temperature .",
