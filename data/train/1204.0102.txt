    "the magnetic properties of transition metal compounds with @xmath2 valence electrons have been one of the central research themes in solid - state physics for the past three decades . in view of the interplay between magnetism and high - temperature superconductivity ,",
    "particular attention has been focused on oxides and arsenides .",
    "recently , the electronic structure and ordering phenomena of transition metal compounds with @xmath4 and @xmath5 valence electrons ( such as ruthenates and iridates ) have also captured much attention .",
    "the electronic correlations in these materials are generally weaker than those of their @xmath2 counterparts , while the spin - orbit coupling is stronger .",
    "the quantitative description of the influence of these parameters on the electronic phase behavior of @xmath6-electron compounds is an important topic of current research .",
    "here we report a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 , a recently synthesized orosel electrically insulating compound with a magnetic lattice of pd@xmath7 ions in the electron configuration @xmath8 .",
    "we compare our results to the isostructural compound nias@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is based on ni@xmath9 ions with the same number of electrons in the @xmath2-shell .",
    "pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallizes in the pbsb@xmath0o@xmath1 structure with pd@xmath9 and as@xmath10 ions segregated into different layers ( fig .",
    "the octahedral coordination of pd@xmath9 in this structure is unusual , because divalent palladium shows a strong preference for square - planar coordination , which is associated with a diamagnetic ground state .",
    "only a few examples of sixfold - coordinated pd@xmath9 compounds are known , including the ambient- and high - pressure polymorphs of pdf@xmath0 as well fluoro - palladates of composition _ _ m__pdf@xmath11 ( _ m _",

    "@xcite these compounds are paramagnetic at high temperatures and tend to order antiferromagnetically upon cooling . in accord with this trend ,",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements on pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 showed paramagnetic behavior at room temperature , and an antiferromagnetic phase transition at the nel temperature @xmath13 k. @xcite this behavior is qualitatively analogous to the one of the isostructural 3__d__-homologues mnas@xmath0o@xmath1 , coas@xmath0o@xmath1 , and nias@xmath0o@xmath1 , which also show antiferromagnetic ordering with @xmath14 , 20 , and 30 k , respectively .",
    "@xcite however , the much higher nel temperature of pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 is surprising , especially because the pdo@xmath1-octahedra do not share vertices , edges or faces .",
    "the exchange paths connecting neighboring pd@xmath9 ions are therefore long and involve at least two bridging oxygen sites .    in order to elucidate the microscopic origin of this surprising behavior , we have used neutron diffraction to determine the magnetic structure of pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 , which turned out to be identical to that of the 3__d__-homologues ( section ii ) .",
    "this implies similar networks of exchange bonds in both sets of compounds .",
    "we employed density - functional calculations to obtain insights into the electronic structure of pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 and nias@xmath0o@xmath1 , and specifically into the origin of the exchange paths ( which turned out to be hopping via as dimers ) and of the large amplitude difference of the primary exchange interaction parameters ( section iii ) . a model based on these interactions",

    "@xcite the mixed powder was pressed into pellets and dried in evacuated silica tubes for 12 h at 373 k. then the evacuated silica tubes were heated up to 973 k with a rate of 100 k / h .",

    "a total of 14 parameters was refined : an overall scale factor , five profile function parameters , the zero point , two lattice constants , the positional parameters _ x _ and _ z _ of the oxygen atom as well as three isotropic thermal parameters .",
    "the powder sample contained small amounts of the binary oxide pdo , which crystallizes in the tetragonal space group @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite here it can be seen that the positional parameters of the oxygen atoms determined at 5 and 200 k are in good agreement , indicating that the structural changes between the magnetically ordered and the paramagnetic states are weak .",

    "@xcite in table i it can be seen that the structural parameters obtained at 200 and 300 k show relatively large discrepancies , despite the fact that both data sets were collected in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this can be ascribed to the larger scattering power of the o - atoms in neutron diffraction , with the consequence that the o - positions can be determined more reliably .",
    "furthermore , the shortest oxygen contact _ d_(o - o ) = 2.308(3 )  was found to be implausibly short in the x - ray study .",

    "the cell volume of the ni compound ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) is much smaller than the one of the pd compound ( @xmath33 @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is due to fact that the ionic radius of pd@xmath9 is larger than that of ni@xmath9 . in order to keep the as - o - bond lengths almost constant in the aso@xmath1-octahedra ,",
    "the bond angle @xmath34(o - as - o ) increases from 169.91(3)@xmath22 in pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 ) to 173.23(12)@xmath22 in nias@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "typically valid for late transition metal elements like pd or ni , the antiferromagnetic contribution is related to the hopping integral @xmath40 by the second - order perturbation relation @xmath39 @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the effective on - site coulomb repulsion defined for the wannier orbitals .",
    "considering the hopping integrals in table iii , the contribution from the @xmath43 term in the magnetic exchange gives rise to a factor two difference between the pd and ni compounds .",
    "the estimate of @xmath42 , unlike that of the hopping integral @xmath40 , is a rather delicate issue . in principle",
    ", one should compute @xmath42 for the wannier orbitals shown in figure 7 . however lacking a prescription to do so , we computed the @xmath42 values corresponding to ni-@xmath6 and pd-@xmath6 partial waves , which were truncated outside the atomic spheres defined around an ni or pd sites .",
    "the calculations were carried out within the framework of the constrained dft scheme  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 values calculated in this way were @xmath44 ev and @xmath45 ev .",
    "but since the wannier @xmath46 orbitals are far more delocalized than the truncated partial waves , and more so for pd than for ni , these @xmath42 values should be significantly reduced , and more so for pd than for ni .",
    "this could conceivably lead to the factor @xmath47 needed to bring our theoretical @xmath48 estimate for the nel temperatures of the two compounds into agreement with the measured ratio of 4.7 .",
    "taking into account only the dominant hopping integrals provided by the @xmath49mto - downfolding calculation , a spin model can be defined in terms of the six pairs of 3rd - nearest - neighbor magnetic interactions , all of size @xmath50 , obtained by summing over the squares of the @xmath46hopping integrals between the 3rd - nearest neighbors .",
    "based on this model , we have calculated the magnetic susceptibility by considering the following spin-1 hamiltonian :    @xmath51    this model was solved by the quantum monte carlo method @xcite on a @xmath52 lattice .",
    "the primary interaction @xmath50 , and the effective land @xmath53-factors were obtained by fitting to the experimental susceptibility .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the calculated and measured susceptibilities agree very well .",
    "the optimal values of the @xmath53-factor and the exchange parameter @xmath50 , were found to be respectively 2.38 and 62 k for the pd compound , and 2.48 and 13 k for the ni compound .",
    "we find that the @xmath53-factors are larger than the spin - only value of 2 , in accord with the discussion in section ii.c above .",
    "the fit of the susceptibilities yields a value of 5 for the ratio of the predominant magnetic exchange parameters of pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 and nias@xmath0o@xmath1 , in good agreement with the ratio of the magnetic transition temperatures .",

    "using a combination of susceptibility and neutron diffraction measurements , we have developed a comprehensive experimental description of the magnetic properties of the newly synthesized antiferromagnet pdas@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
