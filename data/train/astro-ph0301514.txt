    "supernovae and their remnants ( snrs ) play essential roles for the structure and evolution on the galaxy ; they are the major sources of galactic hot ( @xmath4  k ) medium , their blast waves compress the interstellar medium and trigger successive star formations , and they produce and distribute heavy elements in the whole galaxy and even in the intergalactic space .    snrs would also be the most plausible birthplace of high - energy cosmic rays near to the knee energy ( @xmath5 ev ) ; the supporting evidence is the detection of synchrotron x - rays from the shell of some of the snrs ( e.g. ,  koyama et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; slane et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the detection of tev @xmath6-rays from some of them ( e.g. ,  tanimori et al .  1998 ; muraishi et al .",
    "2000 ; enomoto et al .",
    "electrons should be accelerated to high energies up to about 1 tev or even more , possibly by the first - order fermi acceleration mechanism . since the energy gain ( acceleration )",
    "rates of electrons are proportional to @xmath7 ( the strength of the magnetic field ) and the energy loss ( due to synchrotron radiation ) rates are proportional to @xmath8 , high energy electrons responsible for the synchrotron x - rays are likely to exist in a shell of rather weak magnetic field , where the radio flux should be faint ( the flux is proportional to @xmath8 ) .",
    "snrs may also be concerned as the major origin of the galactic ridge x - rays ( the grxs ) .",
    "the grxs are diffuse x - rays extending along the galactic inner disk @xcite .",
    "the spectrum shows thin thermal plasma of about 10@xmath9  k , with prominent k - shell lines from highly ionized irons .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the grxs are attributable to truly diffuse sources , not an integrated emission of many point sources @xcite .",
    "however , real origin of the diffuse grxs has been a big puzzle ; no known diffuse source can account for the observed spectrum and flux of the grxs .",
    "therefore the grxs may predict presence of many diffuse x - ray sources , whether these are new x - ray snrs or a new class of x - ray sources .",
    "surveys with _",

    "data acquisition from acis - i was made in timed - exposure faint mode with the chip readout times of 3.24  s. data reduction and analysis were made using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software version 2.2 . using level 2 processed events provided by the pipeline processing at the _ chandra _ x - ray center",

    "33  counts  s@xmath16 , depending on the size of the point - spread function ( psf ) , the energy band , and the background level .",

    "the point source events , which are in the psf ( 90% encircled radii ) circles around the point sources detected with the wavdetect software ( see subsection 3.1 ) , were removed from the source events .",

    "1 represents only the southern part of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 , the spectral parameters except the flux are consistent with those of obs .  2 , the full spectrum of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 .",
    "we therefore carried out a simultaneous fit to the obs .  1 and 2 spectra with a power - law model leaving each normalization of the two observations independent .",
    "the fit is acceptable with the best - fit parameters given in table  1 .    to examine the possibility for a thermal plasma origin",
    ", we also proceeded a simultaneous fit with a model of a thin thermal plasma in non - equilibrium ionization , an nei model ( borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ; a revised version from an original code by @xcite ) .",
    "this nei model is acceptable with the best - fit parameters in table  1 .",
    "the metal abundances , however , is lower ( @xmath29  solar ) and the temperature is higher ( @xmath30  5.4  kev ) than any of the diffuse thermal sources ( e.g. , snrs and star forming regions ) in the galaxy .",
    "the spatial correlation between the diffuse x - ray and radio is demonstrated by the 20  cm vla contours in figure  1 , with the designation of the radio source ( a  i ) given by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission consists of many clumps filling an ellipse which is partly outlined by the radio sources c and f , the snr candidates proposed by @xcite .",
    "the south tail of the radio source g is also correlated with the x - ray enhancement . though the source h is said to be extragalactic because of its infrared emission @xcite , it is also inside ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 and may be associated .",
    "note , however , no significant x - ray emission is associated with the source e , which is a partial radio shell and an snr candidate suggested by @xcite .",
    "since the wavdetect software detected four point sources in cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 ( the crosses in figure  2 ) , we examined in detail whether these sources are really point sources or not , and found no clear evidence for point sources . the brightest source located at south - west , for example , has a wider radial profile than psf as is demonstrated in figure  4 .",
    "the light curves of all these `` point sources '' show no time variability on the time scale of 10@xmath31 to 10@xmath32  s. although statistics are limited , the x - ray spectra are found to be consistent with that of the whole of cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 .",
    "furthermore the total flux of these `` point sources '' is only 1/4 of that from cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 .",
    "accordingly , we regard the `` point sources '' are due to local enhancement of the bright diffuse source cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 was made from the full elliptical region of @xmath33 shown in figure  2 .",
    "we used the same background spectrum as that for ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 in obs .",
    "as is given in figure  5 , the background - subtracted spectrum is much softer than that of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 , and shows clear emission lines at 1.85 and 2.41  kev , which are equal to or slightly lower than those from he - like si and s. we fitted the spectrum with an nei model .",
    "this model is acceptable ( @xmath34/d.o.f = 22.2/39 ) with the best - fit parameters given in table  2 and the best - fit model in figure  5 .",
    "we found that the newly identified snr ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 has many x - ray clumps , which are globally filling an elliptical region .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well - fitted with either a power - law or a thin thermal plasma model , similar to the _ asca _ spectrum @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ gives more severe constraint on the thin thermal parameters than _ asca _ , due mainly to the removal of the contamination from the thermal source cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 .",
    "the thermal scenario of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 requires uncomfortably high temperature ( @xmath35  kev ) and low metal abundance ( @xmath36  solar ) ( table  1 ) .",
    "this strengthens the conclusion made with _ asca _",
    "@xcite that the x - rays of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 is non - thermal origin with a power - law spectrum .",
    "the absorption ( @xmath37 ) of @xmath38  @xmath39 is slightly larger than , but roughly similar to the _ asca _ result .",
    "we therefore adopt the source distance to be 7  kpc following the discussion of @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity ( 2.010.0  kev ) and the source size are then estimated to be @xmath40  erg  s@xmath16 and 18  pc ( mean diameter ) , respectively .",
    "since the spectrum is a power - law with the photon index of 2.1 ( the energy index of 1.1 ) , the x - rays would be due to synchrotron emission from high energy electrons in a power - law distribution .",
    "the corresponding spectral index of the electrons is 3.2 , which is larger than the value of 2 which is expected by the first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "this steepening in the x - ray band is also seen in all of the well established snrs as a site of high energy electrons ( sn  1006 , g347.3@xmath00.5 , and rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 , e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; slane et al .",
    "2001 ) , and their photon indices are very similar ( between @xmath41 ) .    for a wide - band study of the synchrotron emission , we fitted the x - ray spectrum with an srcut model @xcite , assuming the energy index ( @xmath42 ) in the radio band ( 1  ghz ) to be 0.5 or 0.6 .",
    "the derived cut - off energy and the flux density at 1.5  ghz are shown in table  3 . here",
    ", the absorption is consistent with the fit with the power - law model .",
    "both of the predicted radio fluxes at 20  cm by the srcut model ( for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) are smaller than the summed flux of the radio clumps c , f , g and h ( @xmath45  jy ; helfand et al .",
    "this apparent inconsistency may be due to our simple assumption that magnetic field strength ( @xmath7 ) and density of high energy electrons ( @xmath46 ) are uniform in the ellipse .",
    "more realistic assumption is that the radio clumps have higher @xmath7 than the average , hence produces high contrast of the radio flux . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray flux contrast is small , because @xmath46 of higher energy electrons ( which emits x - rays ) are smaller than the average , due to the high synchrotron energy loss at high @xmath7 .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observed x - ray and radio morphology . in this case",
    ", the srcut model predicts that in those regions the cut - off energy is lower and the x - ray spectrum is steeper than the other part .",
    "the limited photon flux , however , does not allow us to verify this scenario .",
    "we note that g347.3@xmath00.5 , which is one of the well established snrs as the site of high energy electrons , also shows no good correlation with the radio and x - rays @xcite .",
    "the primary candidate for the reason is the variation of the strength of magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) from place to place . to clarify this issue , fine spatial and deep observations in both the radio and x - ray bands",
    "are encouraged .    assuming energy equi - partition @xcite , we derived the strength of magnetic field @xmath47 and the total energy of non - thermal electron @xmath48 in table  3 .",
    "the total energy of non - thermal electron is about 1/20 times that of sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy of electrons is estimated to be 140 ( @xmath42 = 0.5 ) or 200  tev ( @xmath42 = 0.6 ) .",
    "the synchrotron cooling times of the electrons are @xmath49  yr .      the x - ray energy spectrum of cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 , thin thermal spectrum with 0.7  kev temperature and solar abundance , is typical for young and intermediate - age snrs .",
    "since the projected position of this source is in the snr ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 and is associated with the non - thermal radio source f @xcite , a naive scenario is that cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 is a thermal counterpart of the snr",
    ". it may be possible that we have a large shell whose soft x - ray emission is invisible because heavily absorbed . while a reverse shock is propagating toward the center , the core region makes harder spectrum .",
    "hence , cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 might be one of the clumps made by the reverse shock .",
    "adopting the same distance as ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 ( 7 kpc ) , we estimate that the x - ray luminosity ( 0.710.0  kev ) is @xmath50  erg  s@xmath16 and the physical size is @xmath51  pc of `` head '' and 1.0  pc - long `` jet '' . assuming a uniform density of a prorate sphere with @xmath52 pc diameters , the density of the `` head '' is @xmath53 @xmath54 . from the ionization parameter ( @xmath55 ) of @xmath56",
    "@xmath54  s , this plasma would be heated - up very recently ( @xmath57 years ago ) , possibly by the reverse shock .    since",
    "cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 exhibits twice larger absorption than ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 , this source is likely located at the distance of 14 kpc . derived plasma luminosity , size and density are still consistent with being a young snr behind ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 .",
    "since the absorption of cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 is nearly the same as the total galactic absorption through the galactic plane @xcite , a possibility of an extragalactic source can not be excluded .",
    "the jet - like morphology is also unusual for an snr plasma , but rather resembles the hot plasmas associated with the jet sources , like ss433 or agn .",
    "it is unclear whether cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 is a thermal component associated with ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 , another snr located in the far side of our galaxy , or an extragalactic source .      the present discovery of many clumps with low surface brightness both in the hard ( ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 ) and soft ( cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 ) bands may have important hints on the grxs .",
    "the grxs have been found to exhibit three components , with two thermal plasma and hard non - thermal - tail @xcite .",
    "the high temperature plasma ( 710  kev ) emits strong k - shell lines from he - like irons ( the hard component ) , while low temperature plasma ( 0.7  kev ) has prominent k - shell lines from he - like si and s , which is very similar to cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 .",
    "the grxs are prominent in the inner disk of the galactic longitude @xmath58 , and the positions of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 and cxo  j184357@xmath0035441 are near the edge of this inner disk .",
    "the absorption corrected surface brightness of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 in the 2.0@xmath010  kev band is @xmath59  erg  @xmath39  s@xmath16  sr@xmath16 , which corresponds to @xmath60 times that of the hard component ( high temperature plasma and non - thermal tail ) of grxs at b@xmath610@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the size of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 ( @xmath3065  arcmin@xmath63 ) is @xmath64 times the region covered by obs . 1 and obs .",
    "2 ( @xmath30510  arcmin@xmath63 ) . from these values , we can estimate that in the 2.0@xmath010  kev band , the contribution of ax  j1843.8@xmath00352 is @xmath301/3 of the hard component of the grxs from the region covered by the @xmath65 observations .",
