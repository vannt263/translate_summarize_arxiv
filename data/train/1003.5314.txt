    "recent experiments on ultracold atomic systems confined to one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite have attracted renewed interest in bethe ansatz integrable models of interacting bosons and multi - component fermions .",
    "the most recent experimental breakthrough is the realization of a 1d spin - imbalanced fermi gas of @xmath1li atoms under the degenerate temperature @xcite .",
    "this study demonstrates how ultracold atomic gases in 1d may be used to create non - trivial new phases of matter , and also paves the way for direct observation and further study of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states @xcite .",
    "three - component fermions exhibit a rich scenario , revealing more exotic phases @xcite .",
    "notably , strongly attractive three - component ultracold atomic fermions can form three - body bound states called _ trions_. consequently , a phase transition between bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) like pairing superfluid and trionic states is expected to occur in the strong attractive regime @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical analysis has focused on the attractive strong coupling limit .",
    "a pertinent discussion in this context is what happens at intermediate and weak attractive coupling regimes    in this paper we consider one - dimensional three - component ultracold fermions with @xmath2-function interaction in external magnetic fields . from a mathematical point of view , this model was solved long ago by sutherland @xcite and takahashi @xcite through bethe ansatz techniques .",
    "recently , integrable models of three - component interacting fermions @xcite have received renewed interest in connection with ultracold atomic gases .",
    "advanced experimental techniques newly developed allow to explore three - component fermi gas with different phases of trions , dimers and free atoms @xcite .",
    "remarkably , direct observation of a trimer state consisting of fermionic @xmath1li atoms in the three energetically lowest substates has been just reported in @xcite .",
    "this opens up an opportunity to experimentally study such novel quantum phases of trions and pairs in 1d three - component fermi gases , providing a physical ground and stimulus for the investigation of their theoretical aspects .",
    "our aim here is to expand on the theoretic knowledge of 1d integrable model of three - component fermions by undertaking a detailed analysis of how the different phases modify as the inter - component interaction decreases , ranging from a strong to a weak regime .",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the critical fields and construct the full phase diagrams in the weak coupling regime by solving the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "we extend previous work on this model @xcite to derive higher order corrections for these physical quantities in the strong coupling regime .",
    "numerical solutions of the dressed energy equations show that the pure trionic phase existing in the strong coupling regime reduces as the coupling decreases and it disappears in the presence of external fields when the weak regime is approached .",
    "in contrast to the two - component interacting fermions @xcite , nonlinear zeeman splitting may sustain a bcs - like paired phase in the three - component attractive fermions for weak coupling regime .",
    "we consider a @xmath2-function ( contact potential ) interacting system of @xmath3 fermions with equal mass @xmath4 , which can occupy three possible hyperfine levels ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) with particle number @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "they are constrained to a line of length @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath12 the first and second terms correspond to the kinetic energy and @xmath2-interaction potential , respectively .",
    "the last term denotes the zeeman energy @xmath13 , with the zeeman energy levels @xmath14 determined by the magnetic moments @xmath15 and the magnetic field @xmath16 . for later convenience",
    ", the zeeman energy term can also be written as @xmath17 , where the unequally spaced zeeman splitting in three hyperfine levels can be specified by two independent parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the average zeeman energy .",
    "the spin - independent contact interaction @xmath21 remains between fermions with different hyperfine states and preserves the spins in each hyperfine states , i.e. , the number of fermions in each spin states are conserved .",
    "although these conditions seem rather restrictive , it is possible to tune scattering lengths between atoms in different low sublevels to form nearly @xmath0 degeneracy fermi gases via broad feshbach resonances.@xcite . consequently the model still captures the essential physics relevant in the discussion of multiple phases in three - component ultracold fermi gases .",
    "the inter - component coupling @xmath22 with interaction strength @xmath23 is determined by the effective 1d scattering length @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is attractive for @xmath25 and repulsive for @xmath26 . here",
    "we will focus in the attractive case . for simplicity , we choose the dimensionless units of @xmath27 and use the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath28 with linear density @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) exhibits spin @xmath0 symmetry and was solved long ago by means of the nested bethe ansatz @xcite . in this approach",
    "its spin content was incorporated via the symmetry of the wavefunction .",
    "the energy eigenspectrum is given in terms of the quasimomenta @xmath30 of the fermions through    @xmath31    satisfying the following set of coupled bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) @xcite @xmath32 written also in terms of the rapidities for the internal hyperfine spin degrees of freedom @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "for attractive interaction , the bae allow charge bound states and spin strings .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 symmetry carries two kinds of charge bound states : trions and pairs . in principle",
    ", different numbers of unpaired fermions , pairs and trions can be chosen to populate the ground state by carefully tuning @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in the strong coupling regime @xmath46 ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the bound states become equal - spaced , i.e. , a trionic state has the form @xmath47 and for the bound pair @xmath48 . substituting these root patterns into the bae ( [ be ] )",
    ", we find their real parts , from which the ground state energy in the strongly attractive regime can be obtained @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the density for unpaired fermions , pairs and trions , respectively .",
    "this state can be considered as a mixture of unpaired fermions , pairs and trionic fermions , behaving basically like particles with different statistical signatures @xcite . for strong attractive interaction , trions are stable compared to the bcs - like pairing and unpaired states . from ( [ e ] ) we can obtain the binding energy for a trion , given by @xmath52 and the pair binding energy , which is @xmath53 .    in the weak coupling regime",

    "the real parts of the quasimomenta deviate smoothly from the values evaluated for the @xmath60 case . with this root configuration",
    ", the ground state energy in the weak attractive regime can be obtained @xmath61    the ground state energy ( [ eweak ] ) is dominated by the kinetic energy of composite particles and unpaired fermions and has an interaction energy consisting of density density interaction between charge bound states and between charge bound states and unpaired fermions . from equation ( [ eweak ] ) we can obtain the binding energy for a trion , given by @xmath62 and the pair binding energy , which is @xmath63 . for weak attractive interaction , the trionic state is unstable against thermal and spin fluctuations .",

    "the numerical solution is also employed to confirm the analytical expressions for the physical quantities and the resulting phase diagrams of the model in the weak coupling limit ( see @xcite for a similar discussion in the strong regime ) .",

    "<S> higher order corrections for these physical quantities are presented in the strong attractive regime . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions of the dressed energy equations allow us to examine how the different phase boundaries modify by varying the inter - component coupling throughout the whole attractive regime . </S>",
    "<S> the pure trionic phase existing in the strong coupling regime reduces smoothly by decreasing this coupling until the weak limit is reached . in this weak regime </S>",
    "<S> , a pure bcs - like paired phase can be sustained under certain nonlinear zeeman splittings . </S>"
