    "the phase @xmath19 occurs when @xmath17 mixing interferes with @xmath20 , where an additional @xmath21 penguin amplitude implies also direct cp violation .",
    "since a direct cp asymmetry involves a ratio of two hadronic amplitudes and their relative strong phase , both of which are not reliably calculable , one faces hadronic uncertainties whenever one is relating cp asymmetries to @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "a model - independent way of resolving or at least reducing these uncertainties is by flavor symmetries , isospin or broken su(3 ) , relating certain processes to others .",
