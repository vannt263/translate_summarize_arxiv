    "power system is the name given to a collection of devices that generate , transmit , and distribute energy to consuming units such as residential buildings , factories , and street lighting .",
    "abusing language , we use the terms power and energy interchangeably , as typically done in the power systems literature . excluding a small portion of generating units , such as solar cells and fuel cells",
    ", we can think of power generators in a power system as electromechanical systems @xcite .",
    "natural sources , such as the chemical energy trapped in fossil fuels , are used to generate mechanical energy , which is then converted into electrical energy .",
    "when power systems are working in normal operating conditions , i.e. , in _ steady - state _ , the generators satisfy two main conditions : @xmath0 their rotors rotate with the same velocity , which is also known as _ synchronous velocity _ , and @xmath1 the generated voltages are sinusoidal waveforms with the same frequency . keeping the velocity of the generators at the synchronous velocity and the terminal voltages at the desired levels is called _ frequency stability _ and _ voltage stability _ , respectively @xcite .",
    "when all the generators are rotating with the same velocity , they are synchronized and the relative differences between the rotor angles remain constant .",
    "the ability of a power system to recover and maintain this synchronism is called _ rotor angle stability_. _ transient stability _ , as defined in @xcite , is the maintenance of rotor angle stability when the power system is subject to large disturbances .",
    "these large disturbances are caused by faults on the power system such as the tripping of a transmission line .    in industry ,",
    "the most common way of checking transient stability of a power system is to run extensive time - domain simulations for important fault scenarios @xcite .",
    "this way of developing action plans for the maintenance of transient stability is easy and practical _ if _ we know all the  important \" scenarios that we need to consider .",
    "unfortunately , power systems are large - scale systems and the number of possible scenarios is quite large . since an exhaustive search of all of these scenarios is impossible , power engineers need to guess the important cases that they need to analyze .",
    "these guesses , as made by humans , are prone to errors .",
    "moreover , time - domain simulations do not provide insight for developing control laws that guarantee transient stability @xcite .",
    "because of these reasons , additional methods are required for transient stability analysis .",
    "currently , the methods that do not rely on time - domain simulations can be collected in two different groups : direct methods and automatic learning approaches .",
    "the latter , automatic learning approaches @xcite , are based on machine learning techniques . in this work ,",
    "we do not consider automatic learning approaches and we focus on direct methods .",
    "direct methods are based on obtaining lyapunov functions for simple models of power systems @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the origin of the idea can be found in the 1947 paper of magnusson @xcite which uses the concept of  transient energy \" which is the sum of kinetic and potential energies to study the stability of power systems . in 1958 ,",
    "aylett , assuming that a two - machine system can be represented by the dynamical equation @xmath2 showed that there exists a separatrix dividing the two - dimensional plane of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into two regions @xcite .",
    "one of the regions is an invariant set with respect to the two - machine system dynamics , i.e. , if the initial condition is in this set , trajectories stay inside this set for all future time .",
    "aylett concluded that in order to check the stability of the system , we only need to check whether the state is in the invariant set or not .",
    "aylett also characterized the separatrix that defines the invariant set and extended the results from the two - machine case to the three - machine case in the same monograph .",
    "although the term  lyapunov function \" was not stated explicitly in his work , aylett s work used lyapunov - based ideas .",
    "some of the other pioneering works on direct methods include szendy @xcite , gless @xcite , el - abiad and nagaphan @xcite , and willems @xcite . the work based on direct methods mainly focused on finding better lyapunov functions that work for more detailed models and provide less conservative results .",
    "these lyapunov functions are used to estimate the region of attraction of the stable equilibrium points that correspond to desired operating conditions .",
    "the stability of a power system after the clearance of a fault can then be tested by determining if the post - fault state belongs to the desired region of attraction . for further information",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "there are several problematic issues with direct methods .",
    "the first problem is the set of assumptions used to construct these models .",
    "the models used for transient stability analysis implicitly assume that the angular velocities of the generators are very close to the synchronous velocity . in other words , it is assumed that the system is very close to desired equilibrium and the models developed based on this assumption are used to analyze the stability of the same equilibrium .",
    "the standard answer given to this objection is the following : the models that are used in transient stability studies are used only for the  first swing \" transients and for these transients the angular velocities of the generators are very close to the synchronous velocity .",
    "unfortunately , in real world scenarios large swings need to be considered . citing the post mortem report  @xcite on the august 14 , 2003 blackout in canada and the northeast of the united states ,",
    "`` the large frequency swings that were induced became a principal means by which the blackout spread across a wide area '' .",
    "using models based on `` first swing '' assumptions to analyze cases like the august 14 , 2003 blackout does not seem reasonable .",
    "the second problem is that the models used for transient stability analysis , again implicitly , pose certain assumptions on the grid .",
    "the transmission lines are modeled as impedances and the loads are either modeled as impedances or as constant current sources .",
    "these modeling assumptions are used to eliminate the internal nodes of the network via a procedure called kron reduction @xcite . the resulting network after kron reduction is a strongly connected network .",
    "every generator is connected to every other generator via transmission lines modeled as a series connection of an inductor and a resistor . after this reduction process",
    ", the resistances in the reduced grid are neglected .",
    "the fundamental reason behind the neglect of the resistances lies in the strong belief , in the power systems community , about the non - existence of lyapunov functions when these resistances are not neglected .",
    "this belief stems from the paper @xcite which asserts the non - existence of global lyapunov functions for power systems with losses in the reduced power grid model .",
    "it is further supported by the fact that the lyapunov functions that the power systems community has developed contain path - dependent terms unless these resistances are neglected .",
    "the reader should note that the resistors here represent both the losses on the transmission lines _ and _ the loads .",
    "hence this assumption implies that there is no load in the grid ( other than the loads modeled as current injections ) , which is not a reasonable assumption .",
    "in addition to these problems that have their origin in neglecting the resistances on the grid , the process of constructing these reduced models , i.e. kron reduction , can only be performed for a very restrictive class of circuits _ unless _ we assume that all the waveforms in the grid are sinusoidal @xcite . in other words , in order to perform this reduction process for arbitrary networks , we need to use phasors , which in turn requires that all the waveforms in the grid are sinusoidals and every generator in the power grid is rotating with the same velocity .",
    "this assumption is not compatible with the study of transients .      despite the long efforts to obtain control laws for power systems with non - negligible transfer conductances , results only appeared in the beginning of the @xmath5 century .",
    "for the single machine and the two machine cases , a solution , under restrictive assumptions , is provided in @xcite . in the same work ,",
    "the existence of globally asymptotically stabilizing controllers for power systems with more than two machines is also proved but no explicit controller is suggested .",
    "an extension of the results in @xcite to structure preserving models can be found in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the problem of finding explicit globally asymptotically stabilizing controllers for power systems with non - negligible transfer conductances and more than two generators has only been recently solved in @xcite .",
    "although a solution has been offered for an important long - lasting problem , the models that are used in @xcite are still the traditional models that we want to avoid in our work .",
    "there are also some recent related results on synchronization of kuramoto oscillators @xcite . if the generators are taken to be _ strongly overdamped _",
    ", these synchronization results can be used to analyze the synchronization of power networks .",
    "the synchronization conditions obtained in @xcite can also be used in certain micro - grid scenarios @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide results that do not require generators to be strongly overdamped .",
    "all the previously described methods use classical models for power systems .",
    "they are only valid when the generator velocities are very close to the synchronous velocity . in this paper , we abandon these models and use port - hamiltonian systems  @xcite to model power systems from first principles . as already suggested in  @xcite , a power system can be represented as the interconnection of individual port - hamiltonian systems .",
    "there are several advantages of this approach .",
    "first of all , we have a clear understanding of how energy is moving between components .",
    "secondly , we do not need to use phasors .",
    "thirdly , we do not need to assume all the generator velocities to be close to the synchronous velocity . finally , using the properties of port - hamiltonian systems",
    ", we can easily obtain the hamiltonian of the interconnected system , which is a natural candidate for a lyapunov function .",
    "a similar framework , based on passivity , is being used in a research project on the synchronization of oscillators with applications to networks of high - power electronic inverters @xcite .",
    "we first obtain transient stability conditions for generators in isolation from a power system .",
    "these conditions show that as long as we have enough dissipation , there will be no loss of synchronization . in @xcite",
    "the port hamiltonian framework is also used to derive sufficient conditions for the stability of a single generator .",
    "the techniques used in @xcite rely on certain integrability assumptions that require the stator winding resistance to be zero . in contrast , our results hold for non - zero stator resistances .",
    "moreover , while in @xcite it is assumed that synchronous generators have a single equilibrium , we show in this paper that generators have , in general , 3 equilibria and offer necessary and sufficient conditions on the generator parameters for the existence of a single equilibrium . with the help of useful properties of port - hamiltonian systems , we obtain sufficient conditions for the transient stability of the interconnected power system from the individual transient stability conditions for the generators .",
    "in addition to these sufficient conditions , which were also reported in @xcite , we provide a deeper discussion on the modeling of synchronous generators and we also explain how to relax the sufficient conditions with the help of facts devices .",
    "our results are important contributions for several reasons .",
    "firstly , we do not use the previously discussed questionable assumptions . without these assumptions",
    ", we can apply our conditions to realistic scenarios including cases with large frequency swings .",
    "secondly , our results relate dissipation with transient stability .",
    "this transparent relation is hard to see in the classical framework due to shadowing assumptions .",
    "thirdly , we exploit compositionality to tame the complexity of analyzing large - scale systems .",
    "we propose simple conditions that can be independently checked for each generator without the need to construct a dynamical model for the whole power system .",
    "finally , extending our framework to more complex models is easier because we use port - hamiltonian models for the individual components .",
    "this flexibility will be helpful to design future control laws for the generators .",
    "we denote the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath6 by and an @xmath7 by @xmath8 matrix of zeros by @xmath9 .",
    "the vector @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is its @xmath13 element .",
    "the @xmath7 by @xmath7 identity matrix is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "we say that @xmath15 is positive semidefinite , denoted by @xmath16 , if @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "if , in addition to this , we also have @xmath19 only if @xmath20 , we call @xmath21 positive definite , denoted by @xmath22",
    ". a matrix @xmath21 is negative semidefinite ( definite ) , denoted by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , if and only if @xmath25 is positive semidefinite ( definite ) .",
    "the gradient of a scalar field @xmath26 with respect to a vector @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 note that the gradient is assumed to be a _",
    "column _ vector .",
    "consider the affine control system @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is a manifold and is a compact set .",
    "the affine control system has a port - hamiltonian representation if there exist smooth functions and satisfying and for all @xmath30 , and there exists a smooth function , which is called the hamiltonian , such that can be written in the form @xmath33 the hamiltonian @xmath34 can be thought of as the total energy of the system .",
    "the output of the port - hamiltonian representation of is given by @xmath35 if we take the time derivative of the hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath36 the term @xmath37 in represents the power supplied to the system .",
    "therefore , property states that the rate of increase of the hamiltonian is less than the power supplied to the system .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details on port - hamiltonian systems .",
    "in this section , we derive the equations of motion for a two - pole synchronous generator from first principles .",
    "the first step in this derivation is to identify the hamiltonian , the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy , of a single generator .",
    "we then derive a stability condition , using the hamiltonian as a lyapunov function , for the synchronous generator when the terminal voltages are known .",
    "although we only consider two - pole synchronous machines , the results in this section can easily be generalized to machines with more than two poles .",
    "every synchronous generator consists of two parts : rotor and stator . several torques act on the rotor shaft and cause the rotor to rotate around its axis .",
    "explicitly , we can write the torque balance equation for the torques acting on the rotor shaft as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath4 is the rotor angle , @xmath39 is the moment of inertia of the rotor shaft , @xmath40 is the damping coefficient , @xmath41 is the applied mechanical torque and @xmath42 is the electrical torque .",
    "the angular velocity of the rotor shaft is @xmath43 .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the rotor can be expressed as @xmath44 using the definition of the angular velocity @xmath45 , we can write in the form @xmath46    in the classical power systems literature , the torque balance equation is scaled by @xmath45 . defining @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and dividing both sides of by a constant value called rated power , the following set of mechanical equations",
    "is obtained : @xmath51 in these equations , the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are assumed to be constant , which implies that @xmath45 is either constant or _ slowly _ changing .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : mech1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : mech2 ] ) do not require such assumptions on @xmath45",
    ".      there are three identical circuits connected to the stator .",
    "these circuits are called _ stator windings _ and they are labeled with letters @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "there are also windings connected to the rotor .",
    "these winding are called _",
    "field windings_. in this work , we consider a synchronous generator with a single field winding . in a cylindrical rotor synchronous generator , which are predominantly used in nuclear and thermal generation units ,",
    "the aggregated effect of the field windings can be modeled by a single circuit @xcite .",
    "hence , the single field winding assumption is reasonable for such generators .",

    "the first class of models in assumption  [ asm : cload ] contains the well - known constant impedance model in the power systems literature .",
    "constant impedance load models are commonly used in transient stability analysis @xcite and can be used to study the transient behavior of induction motors  @xcite . according to the ieee task force on load representation for dynamic performance , more than half of the energy generated in the united states is consumed by induction motors @xcite .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that these three - phase induction motors can be modeled as three - phase circuits with each phase being a series connection of a resistor , an inductor and a voltage drop justifies the constant impedance model usage in transient stability studies .",
    "the @xmath195-circuit model suggested for induction motors in @xcite is also captured by assumption  [ asm : cload ] . in @xcite , it is also stated that lighting loads behave as resistors in certain operational regions .",
    "this observation also suggests the usage of constant impedances for modeling the aggregated behavior of loads .",
    "the second load model in assumption  [ asm : cload ] is also common in the power systems literature @xcite .",
    "any asymptotically stable linear electrical circuit has a unique equilibrium and admits a port - hamiltonian representation with hamiltonian @xmath196 .",
    "by performing a change of coordinates , we can obtain a port - hamiltonian system for the shifted coordinates with the shifted hamiltonian @xmath197 satisfying : @xmath198 let us now consider constant current loads . if a load @xmath199 draws constant current from the network we have @xmath200 .",
    "this implies @xmath201 and the contribution of the constant current load @xmath199 to the incremental power balance is zero .",
    "this observation shows that we can neglect constant current loads since they do not contribute to the incremental power balance .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of the paper we only consider the first type of loads in assumption  [ asm : cload ] .",
    "let @xmath202 be the shifted hamiltonian for generator @xmath203 with respect to the equilibrium point , as defined in section [ sec : stability : sg ] . from section [ sec : stability",
    ": sg ] , we know that for every generator @xmath203 we have @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a matrix obtained by adding subscript @xmath203 to the elements of the matrix @xmath165 given by . using the definitions above , we select our candidate lyapunov function as @xmath206 where @xmath192 is the shifted hamiltonian of the transmission grid that was introduced in assumption [ asm : network ] , section [ sec : mmmodel ] .",
    "our objective is to show that the equilibrium @xmath207 for the generators is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "note that every equilibrium @xmath208 shares the same synchronous velocity @xmath93 .",
    "hence , asymptotical stability of @xmath139 implies that all the generators converge to the synchronous velocity @xmath93 .",
    "in addition to synchronize the generators angular velocity we also need to ensure that the currents flowing through the transmission network converge to preset values respecting several operational constraints such as thermal limits of the transmission lines .",
    "this will also be a consequence of asymptotical stability of the equilibrium @xmath139 .",
    "when this equilibrium is reached , the voltages and currents at the generator terminals are @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "if we now regard the transmission network and the loads as being described by an asymptotically stable linear system driven by the inputs @xmath209 and @xmath210 , we realize that all the voltages and currents in the transmission network and loads will converge to a unique steady state .",
    "we assume that such steady state , uniquely defined by @xmath209 and @xmath210 , satisfies all the operational constraints .",
    "taking the time derivative of @xmath211 , we obtain @xmath212 where follows from , and follows from , , and . if @xmath213 holds for @xmath214 , then @xmath215 for every @xmath216 by theorem [ thm1 ] . therefore ,",
    "if holds for every @xmath216 , we conclude from that @xmath217 this only shows that @xmath218 is negative semi - definite .",
    "since all of the hamiltonians that constitute the total hamiltonian @xmath211 have compact level sets , the level sets of @xmath211 are also compact .",
    "hence , we can apply la salle s invariance principle to conclude that all the trajectories converge to the largest invariant set contained in the set defined by @xmath219 the left hand side of   is a sum of negative definite quadratic terms ( recall that @xmath220 ) and thus only zero when @xmath221 for all @xmath203 .",
    "this implies @xmath222 , hence the generator states globally asymptotically converge to @xmath139 if holds .",
    "the preceding discussion is summarized in the following result .",
    "[ thm2 ] consider a multi - machine power system with @xmath181 generators described by equations with @xmath223 , and @xmath39 loads satisfying assumption [ asm : cload ] interconnected by a transmission network satisfying assumption [ asm : network ] .",
    "let @xmath139 be an equilibrium point for the generators that is consistent with all the equations describing the power system .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath139 is globally asymptotically stable if @xmath224 holds for all @xmath214 .",
    "theorem [ thm2 ] states that in order to check the stability of the multi - machine system , we only need to check a simple condition for each generator in the system .",
    "this makes our result compositional in the sense that the complexity of condition is independent of the size of the network .",
    "all these conditions are bound together by @xmath225 and @xmath226 that obviously depend on the whole network .",
    "however , the computation of the desired steady state currents needs to be performed for reasons other than transient stability and thus are assumed to be readily available .",
    "[ rmk : weak ] we note that if assumption  [ asm : network ] is weakened from asymptotic stability to stability of the transmission network , the equilibrium @xmath139 is still globally asymptotically stable .",
    "however , the voltages and currents in the transmission network are no longer uniquely determined and may violate the operational constraints .    inequality is a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability .",
    "typically , the stator winding resistance @xmath227 for each generator @xmath203 is small and inequality   is only satisfied for small steady state currents .",
    "however , inequality can be enforced by actively controlling the voltage at the generator terminals using a static synchronous series compensator ( sssc ) , a facts device that is typically used for series compensation @xcite of real and reactive power . using a sssc we can introduce voltage drops of @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 at the generator terminals without altering the current .",
    "the turn - on and turn - off times for the thyristors in a sccc are at the level of microseconds  @xcite , small enough to enforce a voltage drop that is a piece - wise constant approximation of @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 .",
    "the approximation error can always be reduced by increasing the number of converter valves in the sssc . by repeating the stability analysis in this section , while taking into consideration this new voltage drop , we arrive at the relaxed condition for global asymptotic stability : @xmath231 since the power throughput of facts devices is in the order of megawatts @xcite we can choose a value for @xmath232 that is several order of magnitude larger than @xmath227 . therefore , the relaxed inequality  ( [ mmconservative2 ] ) allows for large steady - state currents and is widely applicable to realistic examples .",

    "inequality reduces to @xmath255 if the stator winding resistance @xmath178 is zero . since the @xmath26-axis steady state current is negative for both generators ,  ( [ bcond ] ) is satisfied and the equilibrium is unique .",
