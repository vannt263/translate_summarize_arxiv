    "the large extra dimension ( led ) model has been introduced and motivated as a solution to hierarchy problem  @xcite , that is the huge difference between the planck and weak scales .",
    "the basic idea is the confinement of the standard model ( sm ) particles on a brane embedded in the bulk space ( that is the space including the extra dimensions ) , except the graviton which can propagate into the bulk  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the _ fundamental _ planck scale in the bulk is suppressed down to the weak scale by the volume of extra dimension space and so there is no hierarchy problem anymore .    in the same scenario ,",
    "the same idea has been proposed to explain the smallness of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mechanism of confinement of sm particles on the brane relies on the gauge flux conservation which necessitate that just singlets under the sm gauge symmetry can propagate into the bulk .",
    "thus , in principle , in addition to the graviton , the hypothesized right handed neutrinos can also live in the bulk and consequently the volume suppression explains the small neutrino masses .",
    "however , kaluza - klein ( kk ) expansion of the right handed neutrinos after the compactification of extra dimensions manifest towers of sterile neutrinos from the brane point of view which can dramatically affect the oscillation phenomenology of active neutrinos and have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "although the majority of studies derive more and more stringent upper bound on the radius of extra dimensions , still , interestingly , with the current upper limit on the size of extra dimensions , the first kk mode sterile neutrino can have a mass @xmath2  ev which is in the ballpark of what is required for the interpretation of the recently observed anomalies in short baseline neutrino experiments and lsnd / miniboone experiments  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in this line , in  @xcite it is proposed that the reactor and gallium anomalies can be interpreted within the led model .    in this paper",

    "we study the signature of led model in high energy atmospheric neutrinos and , by analyzing the data sets ic-40  @xcite and ic-79  @xcite , we show that it is possible to constrain the radius of extra dimension to @xmath4  cm ( at @xmath5 c.l . ) . also , we estimate the sensitivity of icecube to the led model after taking into account the energy information of collected data and show that the favored region of parameter space by reactor and gallium anomalies  @xcite can be excluded by icecube data .    from the brane point of view",
    "the kk modes of led model resemble a series of sterile neutrino states with increasing masses .",
    "the earth s matter density induce resonant conversion of active neutrinos to these sterile states , which the rate of conversion depends on the energy and zenith angle ( @xmath6 ) of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "phenomenologically , these signatures are similar to the signatures of @xmath0 scenarios consisting of three active neutrinos and @xmath1 sterile states with mixing pattern determined by various mixing angles .",

    "in this section we study the propagation of neutrinos in matter in the led model .",
    "our aim is to investigate the earth s matter effects on the propagation of high energy atmospheric neutrinos in the presence of kaluza - klein modes .",
    "the collected data of high energy atmospheric neutrinos by the icecube detector provides a unique opportunity to search for these effects and so to probe the led model .",
    "the number of leds should be @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 case is excluded by the observed @xmath9 behavior of the gravitational force at the scale of solar system .",
    "the factor suppressing the 4-dimensional planck scale down to @xmath10 tev scale is the volume of the @xmath11-dimensional space , where for the case that leds are compactified on tori with radii @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , it is given by @xmath14 .",
    "it should be noticed that all the radii @xmath12 are not necessarily equal , and in fact , assuming an _ asymmetrical _ compactification in the @xmath11-dimensional space , a hierarchical pattern of @xmath12 elevates the existing bounds on the size of led radii from supernovae cooling and the cosmological considerations  @xcite .",

    "the decrease of the active - sterile mixings by the increase of @xmath1 means that the higher kk modes gradually decouple from the evolution equation in eq .",

    "let us mention two points .",
    "firstly , in the led model for each flavor of the active neutrinos ( or equivalently for each mass eigenstate ) there is a tower of kk modes .",
    "so , just by considering the first mode ( @xmath105 ) three different mass - squared differences can be inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) , which lead to three different resonance energies . however , for @xmath106  cm the first kk mode masses",

    "2 ) by the increase of @xmath1 the mixing between the active and the @xmath40 kk mode states decreases ( @xmath125 ) which leads to less intense active to sterile conversion . so the depth of resonance dips decrease by the increase of energy and for the large values of @xmath1 it is beyond the sensitivity reach of the detector .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the atmospheric neutrino data collected during two phases of icecube construction ic-40  @xcite and ic-79  @xcite ( the numbers mean that at the period of data collection 40 and 79 strings bearing doms were deployed , out of the final 86 strings ) .",

    "@xmath129  cm it means that at least @xmath130 kk modes should be taken into account in the calculation of oscillation probabilities .",
    "on the other hand , icecube is sensitive  tev  @xcite .",

    "thus , practically very few kk modes contribute substantially to the oscillation pattern of the atmospheric neutrinos . in the above discussion we assumed that all the sensitivity of icecube to the sterile neutrinos originate from the resonance region ; while the interference terms in lower energies are also important and so",
    "a few more kk modes should be taken into account .",
    "as a conservative assumption , in the numerical calculations of the next section we consider @xmath141 kk modes in the evolution equations .",
    "the oscillation probabilities of active neutrinos can be found by solving the set of evolution equations in eq .",

    "these deficits can be interpreted in the @xmath0 scenario by the @xmath299 mixing that leads to the oscillation of @xmath96 and @xmath103 to the sterile neutrino states which escape from detection in the detectors  @xcite .",
    "thus , reactor and gallium anomalies require @xmath300 or in the simplest @xmath178 scenario @xmath301 . in a generic @xmath0 scenario",

    "all the angles in the equivalent @xmath0 scenario are inter - related and non - vanishing @xmath243 lead to non - vanishing @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",

    "although the current data exclude only a small part of the region allowed by the reactor and gallium anomalies , considering the energy information of atmospheric neutrino data can almost exclude all the favored regions ( or to confirm the interpretation of these anomalies in terms of led model ) .",
    "performing such an analysis ( i.e. , taking into account the energy binning ) requires detailed information of icecube detector which is not available now .",

    "as can be seen , for both nh and ih cases , the katrin can completely exclude the green and orange shaded regions .",
    "an added bonus of the led model is the explanation of small neutrino masses which can be achieved by introducing singlet fermions living in the bulk of extra dimensions . from the brane point of view",
    "these fermions constitute towers of sterile neutrinos with increasing masses ( the so - called kk modes ) that mix with the active neutrinos and so can affect the phenomenology of neutrino flavor oscillations .",

    "the mixing of the kk modes of the bulk fermions with the active neutrinos lead to resonant conversion of @xmath97 to the undetectable sterile neutrinos at high energies .",
    "the resonance originates from the matter effects ( constant density msw resonance ) during the propagation of atmospheric neutrinos through the earth and would lead to distortions in the zenith and energy distributions of muon - track events at the icecube detector .",
    "icecube has already published two sets of the atmospheric neutrino data ( ic-40 and ic-79 ) and in this paper we analyzed them in the search of features predicted by the led model .",

    "<S> in models with large extra dimensions the smallness of neutrino masses can be naturally explained by introducing gauge singlet fermions which propagate in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the kaluza - klein modes of these fermions appear as towers of sterile neutrino states on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> we study the phenomenological consequences of this picture for the high energy atmospheric neutrinos . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we construct a detailed equivalence between a model with large extra dimensions and a @xmath0 scenario consisting of three active and @xmath1 extra sterile neutrino states , which provides a clear intuitive understanding of kaluza - klein modes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyze the collected data of high energy atmospheric neutrinos by icecube experiment and obtain bounds on the radius of extra dimensions . </S>"
