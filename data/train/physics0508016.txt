    "one of the most important milestones in the development of theoretical atomic physics has been the formulation and application of theories that can simultaneously treat relativistic and correlation effects in atoms .",
    "following the early work of swirles on relativistic hartree - fock or dirac - fock ( df ) theory @xcite , grant made pioneering contributions to the numerical and angular momentum aspects of this theory @xcite which paved the way for further advances in the field .",
    "multi - configuration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) @xcite and relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) @xcite codes were developed in the mid 1970s and early 1980s calculations based on them soon followed @xcite . during the 1980s and 1990s ,",
    "these two theories were applied to a wide range of atoms and ions to study a variety of properties @xcite .",
    "the extension of coupled - cluster theory to the relativistic regime during the last decade is indeed a very significant development @xcite .",
    "linear and non - linear versions of this theory have been successfully used in performing high precision calculations of a number of different atomic properties @xcite .",
    "the present review is by no means comprehensive ; it mainly highlights some of the work on relativistic and correlation effects in atoms undertaken in our group . unlike molecules ,",
    "a number of different relativistic many - body calculations have been carried out on atoms using a variety of methods .",
    "relativistic many - body calculations on atoms are currently much more advanced than those on molecules @xcite .",
    "in addition to the inclusion of the breit interaction , certain types of qed effects have also been included in atomic calculations .",
    "it will take several years before molecular calculations reach this level of sophistication .",
    "relativistic many - body calculations of parity and time reversal violations in some atoms have been performed to an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "these calculations in combination with accurate experiments are now poised to test the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "it is not clear at the present time whether it would be possible to achieve something comparable from studies on discrete symmetry violations of molecules .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section [ dirac - coul ] deals with the dirac - coulomb approximation and the section following it ( section [ beyond - dc ] ) , touches upon the breit interaction and qed effects .",
    "section [ cc - theory ] is an overview of relativistic coupled - cluster theory which has been used in the majority of the calculations considered here . in section [ rel - eff ] , we present the basic ideas underlying two physical effects that are relativistic in origin  fine - structure splitting and permanent electric dipole moment of atoms arising from the electric dipole moment of an electron and have given the results of some representative calculations .",
    "the enhancement of relativistic effects in heavy atoms along with the influence of electron correlation is discussed in section [ rel - enhance ] with reference to correlation energy , hyperfine interactions and parity non - conservation in atoms . in the last section",
    "we make some concluding remarks .",
    "for an @xmath0-electron atom , the relativistic hamiltonian is given by    @xmath1+\\sum_{i < j}^{n}\\frac{e^{2}}{r_{ij}}\\,,\\label{dc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; @xmath6 are the pauli matrices and @xmath7 represents the unit matrix .",
    "@xmath8 is the nuclear potential at the site of the @xmath9th electron and the last term is the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "@xmath10 defined above is known as dirac - coulomb hamiltonian which is clearly not covariant .",
    "this hamiltonian can also be written as    @xmath11    the electron - electron interaction can be approximated by an average potential where each electron moves independently in an average field caused by the nucleus and the other electron .",
    "this is the independent particle model which is the starting point of most atomic physics calculations .",
    "this can be put into a mathematical footing by partitioning the full hamiltonian in the following way : @xmath12 where    @xmath13    is a sum of the one electron operators , @xmath14 it is customary to assume @xmath15 as the dirac - fock potential @xcite and @xmath16 can be treated as a perturbation if there are no strongly interacting configurations in the system .",
    "the many - body atomic state @xmath17 is an eigen function of the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian and satisfies the equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the total angular momentum quantum numbers and @xmath20 is the quantum number which distinguishes each of the atomic states .",
    "these states are expanded in terms of the determinantal wavefunctions which in turn are built from the single particle orbitals .",
    "if @xmath21 s denote the determinantal wavefunctions , then , @xmath22 the coefficients @xmath23s are determined by the choice of the theory .",
    "the single particle orbitals are the two - component dirac spinors ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the principal quantum number and magnetic quantum number respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is a quantum number given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath30 is the total angular momentum of an electron .",
    "positive and negative energy states ]    the solutions of the dirac equation admit both positive and negative energy states @xcite and this is shown in figure [ energy - level ] . for a free particle ,",
    "only continuum states exist above @xmath31and below @xmath32 .",
    "however , electrons in an atom that are acted on by a relativistic mean - field potential in addition to continuum states above @xmath31 and below @xmath32bound states do exist in the interval @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the variational principle fails due to the presence of negative energy states @xcite .",
    "the radial parts of the large and small components of the dirac spinor are expanded in terms of gaussian functions @xcite as follows    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 stands for small and large component respectively and the @xmath37 s are gaussian type functions of the form    @xmath38    in the case of finite basis set expansions the condition of kinetic balance is applied to prevent the variational collapse @xcite . the kinetic balance condition @xcite gives the relation between the large and small component of radial wave function as follows :    @xmath39    in eq .",
    "( [ gto-2 ] ) and ( [ kb-1 ] ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the normalization factors for the large and small components respectively .",
    "the electron - electron interaction can be treated relativistically , by including corrections to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the leading relativistic correction to the coulomb interaction is the breit interaction @xcite , where the interaction hamiltonian is given by , @xmath42 here the matrices @xmath43 are built from the dirac matrices and @xmath44 is the inter - electronic distance .",
    "the magnitude of the breit interaction is smaller than that of the coulomb interaction by a factor @xmath45 , where @xmath2 is the fine structure constant and it can be included perturbatively or self consistently @xcite .",
    "in addition to the breit interaction , inclusion of qed effects like the self - energy and the vacuum polarization @xcite may be necessary for an accurate quantitative description of certain properties where relativistic effects are important .",
    "the process involving the emission and absorption of a virtual photon by the same electron is known as self - energy . according to dirac s theory ,",
    "the vacuum consists of a homogeneous sea of negative - energy electrons .",
    "a bound electron in the atom can interact with an electron in the dirac sea , thereby changing the charge distribution of the negative energy electrons compared to the free - field case .",
    "this results in the creation of electron - positron pairs and hence the vacuum behaves as a polarizable medium .",
    "this process is known as vacuum polarization .",
    "figure [ qed ] illustrates the self - energy and the vacuum polarization processes @xcite .",
    "only a few calculations of self energy and the vacuum polarization ( which together give rise to the lamb shift ) have been performed on many electron atoms . as the coulomb interaction due to the nucleus is much stronger than the electron - electron interactions in the inner shells of heavy atoms , it is reasonable to calculate the lamb shift for such systems using the hydrogenic or screened hydrogenic approximation @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated calculations of qed effects have been carried out in the past few years .",
    "the details of these calculations can be found in a review article by shabaev @xcite .",
    "corrections to coulomb interaction ]",
    "in this section we will briefly introduce the relativistic coupled cluster theory ; one of the most powerful and accurate relativistic many - body theories .",
    "it is equivalant to all order relativistic many - body perturbation theory and has the virtue of being size - extensive @xcite .",
    "most of the work described in the subsequent section are based on this theory .",
    "we start with the df state @xmath46 built out of four component orbitals given by eq .",
    "( [ dirac - spinor ] ) , as the fermi vacuum , and then the normal ordered hamiltonian can be expressed as    @xmath47    where @xmath10 is the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian .    if we project @xmath48 from the left we obtain the correlation energy ( @xmath49 ) and if we project any of the excited determinant @xmath50 we additionally get a set of equations which are used to obtain the @xmath51 amplitudes . using",
    "the normal ordered dressed hamiltonian @xmath52 the corresponding equations for correlation energy and amplitudes become    @xmath53    and    @xmath54    here the state @xmath55 may be singly excited @xmath56 or double excited @xmath57 and so on . the indices @xmath58 refer to holes and @xmath59 to particles .",
    "we have considered the coupled cluster single and double ( ccsd ) approximation , where the cluster operator @xmath51 is composed of one- and two - body excitation operators , _ i.e. _ @xmath60 , and are expressed in second quantization form    @xmath61    contracting the ladder operators @xcite and rearranging the indices , the amplitude equations can be expressed in the form    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a vector consisting of the matrix elements @xmath64 and @xmath51 is the vector representing the excitation amplitudes and @xmath65 is the matrix which depends on the cluster amplitudes so that eq .",
    "( [ cc-5 ] ) is solved self - consistently . for example , a typical contribution to the term @xmath66 is    @xmath67    here @xmath68 is the two - electron coulomb integral and @xmath69 is the cluster amplitude corresponding to a simultaneous excitation of two electrons from orbital @xmath70 and @xmath71 to @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "diagrammatic techniques are used to obtain all the terms which contribute to this specific contribution .    for an atom with one valance electron",
    "we first compute the correlations for the closed shell system , _",
    "i.e. _ singly ionized atom using the closed shell coupled cluster approach .",
    "the reference state for the open shell system is    @xmath74    with the particle creation operator @xmath75 .",
    "then by using the excitation operators for both the core and valance electron the exact state is defined as @xcite :    @xmath76    here @xmath77 is the normal ordered exponential representing the valance part of the wave operator . here",
    "@xmath78    where @xmath79 stands for valance orbital .",
    "@xmath80 contain the particle annihilation operator @xmath81 , and because of the normal ordering it can not be connected to any other valance electron excitation operator and so @xmath77 automatically reduces to @xmath82 .",
    "then we can write the eq.([cc-8 ] ) as    @xmath83    and obtain a set of equations @xcite    @xmath84    and    @xmath85    the eq.([cc-12 ] ) is non - linear in @xmath80 because @xmath86 is itself a function of @xmath80 .",
    "hence , these equations have to solved self - consistently to determine the @xmath80 amplitudes .    the normalized transition matrix element ( @xmath87 ) due to an operator @xmath88 is given by    @xmath89    whereas the expectation value of any operator @xmath88 can be written as the normalized form with respect to the exact state @xmath90 as    @xmath91",
    "the fine - structure splitting is relativistic in origin , but is influenced by electron correlation .",
    "it occurs between the states having same values of the total orbital quantum number @xmath36 , total spin quantum number @xmath35 and different total angular momentum @xmath92 .",
    "there have been many attempts to calculate this quantity for a variety of atoms in their ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "we present here the interesting case of the ground state fine structure splitting of boron which has been calculated by different relativistic approaches @xcite .",
    "boron is an open - shell atom with the configuration @xmath93 .",
    "the relativistic configuration interaction method ( ci ) was used by das _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the single particle orbitals used in the calculations there were obtained by the application of the variational principle .",
    "consider an energy functional given by @xmath94 where @xmath10 is the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian , @xmath95is the @xmath73th configuration state function ( csf ) and @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 being the total angular momenta of the @xmath73th and @xmath100th csfs respectively .",
    "minimization of @xmath101 with respect to the single particle orbitals @xmath102 , @xmath103 yields a set of differential equations which were solved self - consistently by using an appropriate numerical method @xcite . in this calculation ,",
    "all relativistic configurations arising from @xmath93 , @xmath104and @xmath105 were considered . the breit interaction and qed effects ( self - energy and vacuum polarization in the hydrogenic approximation )",
    "were treated as first order perturbations .",
    "we give below the results of the calculation .",
    "the electron correlation contributions ( difference of dirac - coulomb+breit and dirac - fock ) vary from @xmath106 to @xmath107 for @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "it is the evident from table.[fs ] that the breit interaction and the qed effects play an important role and their inclusion is critical in obtaining good agreement with experiments .",

    "it is clear that considerable progress has been made during the past three decades on the relativistic many - body theory of atoms .",
