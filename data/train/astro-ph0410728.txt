    "while the association with the supernova is almost established or strongly suggested for the long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , the origins of short grbs and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) remain unclear .",
    "the observed event rate of short grbs is about a third of the long grbs while the observed event rate of xrfs is also about a third .",
    "although there may be a possible bias effect to these statistics , these numbers are , in an astrophysical sense , the same or comparable . if these phenomena arise from essentially different origins , the similar number of events is just by chance . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are related , the similar number of events is natural and the ratio of the event rate tells us something about the geometry of the central engine .",
    "we propose a unified model in which the central engine of short grbs , long grbs and xrfs is the same and the apparent differences come essentially from different viewing angles . for details ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , short grbs are similar to the first 1 sec of long grbs @xcite , which suggests that the difference between short and long grbs is just the number of pulses , and each pulse is essentially the same .",
    "thus , we may consider that each pulse is produced by essentially the same unit or the sub - jet , and the grb jet consists of many sub - jets .",
    "if many sub - jets point to our line of sight , the event looks like the long grb while if a single sub - jet points to us , the event looks like a short grb . since we can observe only the angular size of @xmath5 within the grb jet with the lorentz factor @xmath6",
    ", different observers will see different number of sub - jets depending on the distribution of sub - jets within the grb jet .",
    "xrfs also appear to be related to grbs .",
    "softer and dimmer grbs smoothly extend to the xrfs @xcite , other properties of the xrfs are also similar to those of the grbs , suggesting that xrfs are in fact soft and dim grbs . in the sub - jet model ,",
    "xrfs are naturally expected when our line of sight is off - axis to any sub - jets @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we show a numerical simulation to demonstrate how the event looks so different depending on the viewing angle in our unified model @xcite .",
    "the whole jet , with an opening half - angle of @xmath7  rad , consists of 350 sub - jets .",
    "all sub - jets are assumed to have the same intrinsic properties , e.g. , the opening half - angle @xmath8  rad , and so on .",
    "we consider the case in which the angular distribution of sub - jets is given by @xmath9 $ ] , where we adopt @xmath10  rad @xcite . in this case ,",
    "sub - jets are concentrated on the central region . for our adopted parameters , isolated sub - jets",
    "exist near the edge of the whole jet with the multiplicity @xmath11 and there exists a viewing angle where no sub - jets are launched .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels of fig .",
    "[ figs ] show the angular distributions of sub - jets and the directions of three selected lines of sight , the observed light curves in the @xmath6-ray bands , and the observed time - integrated spectra , respectively .",
    "note here in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figs ] , `` a '' represents the center of the whole jet and is hidden by the lines of sub - jets .",
    "_ long grb _ : when we observe the source from the @xmath12 axis ( case  `` a '' ) , we see spiky temporal structures ( the upper - middle panel of fig .  1 ) and @xmath13  kev which are typical for the long grbs .",
    "we may identify case `` a '' as long grbs .",
    "_ xrf and x - ray rich grb _ : when the line of sight is away from any sub - jets ( case  `` b '' ) , soft and dim prompt emission , i.e. xrfs or x - ray rich grbs are observed with @xmath14  kev and @xmath15 orders of magnitude smaller fluence than that of case `` a '' ( the right panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the burst duration is comparable to that in case `` a '' .",
    "these are quite similar to the characteristics of xrfs .",
    "we may identify the case  `` b '' as xrfs or x - ray rich grbs .",
    "_ short grb _ : if the line of sight is inside an isolated sub - jet ( case  `` c '' ) , its observed pulse duration is @xmath16 times smaller than case `` a '' .",
    "contributions to the observed light curve from the other sub - jets are negligible , so that the fluence is about a hundredth of the case `` a '' .",
    "these are quite similar to the characteristics of short grbs",
    ". however the hardness ratio ( @xmath17 ) is about 3 which is smaller than the mean hardness of short grbs ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the hardness of short grbs is due to the large low - energy photon index @xmath19 so that if the central engine launches @xmath19 sub - jets to the periphery of the core where @xmath0 is small , we may identify the case `` c '' as the short - hard grbs .",
    "in other words , the hardness of 3 comes from @xmath20 in our simulation so that if @xmath19 , the hardness will be 6 or so .",
    "we suggest here that not only the isotropic energy but also the photon index may depend on @xmath21 .",
    "another possibility is that if short grbs are the first 1  sec of the activity of the central engine , the spectrum in the early time might be @xmath19 for both the sub - jets in the core and the envelope .",
    "this is consistent with a high ks test probability for @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "these possibilities may have something to do with the origin of @xmath24 for the long grbs .",
    "the sub - jets have the same properties .",

    "( right ) time - integrated energy spectrum of the emission from the multiple sub - jets for the observers denoted by `` a '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' . the source is located at @xmath25 .",
    ", width=529 ]",
    "let @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the typical opening half - angle of the sub - jet , the core size of the whole jet and the mean multiplicity in the core . then the total number of the sub - jets ( @xmath29 ) is estimated as @xmath30 , so that the total energy of each sub - jet is @xmath31 erg . in our model ,",
    "the event rate of long grbs is in proportion to @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the number of sub - jets in the envelope of the core with a multiplicity @xmath2 .",
    "then the event rate of short grbs is in proportion to @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 is enough to explain the event rate of short grbs .",
    "since the core may be regarded as a uniform jet , our model for the xrfs is analogous to the off - axis uniform jet model @xcite .",
    "however the afterglow could have a different behavior between the core - envelope sub - jet model and the uniform jet model . in the uniform jet model",
    ", the afterglows of xrfs should resemble the orphan afterglows that initially have a rising light curve @xcite .",
    "an orphan afterglow may be actually observed in xrf 030723 @xcite , but the light curve may peak too early @xcite . the optical afterglow of xrf 020903 is not observed initially ( @xmath36 days ) but may not be consistent with the orphan afterglow @xcite .",
    "these problems could be overcome by introducing a gaussian tail with a high lorentz factor around the uniform jet @xcite since the energy redistribution effects may bring the rising light curve to earlier times @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of a short grb is difficult to predict since it could resemble both the orphan and normal afterglow depending on the sub - jet configuration within the envelope .",
    "it is also found that our model can reproduce the bimodal distribution of @xmath4 duration of grbs observed by batse @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the duration of @xmath2 burst is determined by the angular spreading time of one sub - jet emission , while that of @xmath37 burst is determined by the time interval between the observed first pulse and the last one .",
    "these two different time scales naturally lead a division of the burst @xmath4 durations into the short and long ones .",
    "it has commonly been said that the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath4 durations of batse bursts shows the different origins of short and long grbs . however , the bimodal distribution is also available as a natural consequence of our unified model of short and long grbs",
    ". the clear prediction of our unified model is that short grbs should be associated with energetic sne .",
    "indeed , one of short grbs shows the possible association with a sn @xcite .",
    "even if the sne are not identified with short grbs due to some observational reasons we predict that the spatial distribution of short grbs in host galaxies should be similar to that of the long grbs .",
    "another prediction is that short grbs should have the same total kinetic energies as long grbs , which might be confirmed by radio calorimetry .",
    "interestingly , our model has predicted short xrfs or short x - ray rich grbs @xcite .",
    "they are observed when isolated sub - jets are viewed slightly off - axis .",
    "the observed short xrf  040924 may be a kind of these bursts @xcite ."
