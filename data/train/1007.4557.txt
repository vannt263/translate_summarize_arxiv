    "stars form inside dense cores deep within molecular clouds .",
    "the similarity of the core mass function ( cmf ) to the initial mass function of stars ( imf , see @xcite ) has sometimes been used ( e.g.  @xcite ) as evidence against theories of core formation where no correspondence is anticipated , e.g.  in the competitive accretion picture @xcite . however , the mapping of a given cmf on to the resultant imf is complicated by many factors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , such as the cores varying multiplicity @xcite , star - forming efficiencies @xcite and/or mass - dependent lifetimes @xcite . in fact , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , diverse evolutionary schemes can map the observed cmfs on to the imf , implying the current mass function data are not sufficient to discriminate between different theoretical models by themselves .",
    "the kinematics of star - forming cores , probed with spectral - line observations of dense molecular tracers , are arguably the best discriminator between different models of core formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . for example , cores created by shocks in large - scale flows exhibit large velocity gradients and are located at local maxima in the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the magnetically controlled scenario has more quiescent velocity fields ( e.g.  @xcite ) , well - matched to observations of isolated starless cores with subsonic levels of turbulence ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such quiescent cores are in opposition to purely hydrodynamic models of gravoturbulent fragmentation ( see @xcite ) which produce a majority of cores with supersonic velocity dispersions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite maintain that the physical mechanism of star formation depends on the much debated presence ( or absence ) of turbulent feedback .",
    "in one view , molecular clouds are short - lived ( on timescales of order one dynamical time ) , non - equilibrium structures ( e.g.  @xcite ) characterized by transient turbulence , which dissipates quickly . in this scenario",
    ", stars could form by the collapse of discrete cores .",
    "conversely , molecular clouds might form slowly and be quasi - equilibrium objects ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this would require turbulence to be constantly injected into the clouds , either externally ( from e.g.  supernova blast waves or hii regions ) or internally ( from e.g.  protostellar outflows ) and cores could form through competitive accretion @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that these two disparate views of star formation give rise to distinguishable kinematics in dense stellar precursors and thus the study of core kinematics potentially offers a way to probe the turbulent state of the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "this paper is concerned with the kinematical properties of dense clumps in the perseus molecular cloud ( hereafter simply perseus ) and compares them to theoretical models .",
    "we examine the linewidths , virial masses and ordered velocity gradients of two populations of clumps @xcite identified across scuba dust continuum maps @xcite .",
    "these kinematic signatures are derived for each clump from our wide - field survey ( @xcite , ) of four clusters of star - forming cores towards ngc  1333 , ic348/hh211 ( simply ic348 hereafter ) , l1448 and l1455 in the @xmath1  rotational lines of co and its common isotopologues @xmath11co  and c@xmath0o . in the preceding paper of this series ( @xcite , )",
    ", we explored the evolution of molecular outflows across these regions .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : the remainder of the introduction explains the naming conventions we have adopted to describe star - forming clumps / cores .  [ sec : observations ] briefly describes the continuum data and associated clump catalogues alongside our spectral - line datasets , from which we derive the clump kinematics .",
    "various clump kinematic signatures are investigated in  [ sec : kinematics ] , including the clumps linewidths (  [ sec : linewidths ] ) and virial masses (  [ sec : virialmasses ] ) , before we search for ordered velocity gradients across the face of the clumps in  [ sec : rotation ] , which we interpret with a solid - body - rotation model .",
    "finally , we summarize this work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we adhere to the clump hierarchy explained in @xcite , which follows @xcite .",
    "briefly , molecular clouds contain clumps which in turn harbour cores , the direct precursors of individual or multiple stars .",
    "clumps without embedded objects are _ starless _ , unless they are gravitationally bound when we refer to them as _ prestellar_.",
    "the scuba 850  data analysed have a beam size of 14arcsec ( 0.017pc at 250pc , our adopted distance to perseus , see ) and are sampled on a 3arcsec grid with a typical rms noise level , @xmath12mjybeam@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the kinematics of two populations of dust continuum clumps , which we identified in the scuba 850  data in a previous paper @xcite , using the two most popular automated algorithms : clfind  @xcite and gaussclumps  @xcite .",
    "our motivation in that study was to determine which clump properties can be robustly measured and which depend on the extraction technique .",
    "we continue that approach in this work , analysing the kinematic signatures for each population in turn .    in @xcite , we located 85 and 122 clumps using clfind  and gaussclumps  respectively with peak flux densities @xmath13mjybeam@xmath5 , across the same areas where we also have c@xmath0o  @xmath1  data .",
    "the clumps were identified as starless , class 0 or class i protostars using the classifications of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter ) , which are based on source seds incorporating _ spitzer _ data .",
    "we associate a clump with a source , if the separation between the clump and source peak positions is less than the clump s diameter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given the similarities in the extraction method and resulting population , most of the clfind  clumps are directly on top of the sources and are unambiguously identified .",
    "however , three gaussclumps  sources are large enough to encapsulate two sources and their results are correspondingly included in the population statistics twice .",
    "the c@xmath0o  @xmath1  observations used in this analysis were undertaken with harp  ( the heterodyne array receiver project ; @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope and have been described in detail previously . striping artefacts resulting from systematic differences in calibration between harp  channels",
    "were removed using a ` flatfield ' procedure ( fully described in ) .",
    "the final datasets are sampled on a 3arcsec grid , distributed using a gaussian gridding kernel with a 9arcsec full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) , yielding an equivalent beam size of 17.7arcsec .",
    "the median rms spectral noise values , averaged across each region s map ( measured in 0.15kms@xmath5  channels ) , are 0.18 , 0.15 , 0.15 and 0.14k for ngc  1333 , ic348 , l1448 and l1455 respectively .",
    "in molecular clouds , the c@xmath0o @xmath1 line is expected to be optically thin and excited in dense regions ( @xmath14@xmath9 ) .",
    "it should therefore trace material in the vicinity of or within the dense agglomerations surveyed with scuba . at the peak of every clump in our two catalogues ( see  [ sec : clumpcats ] ) , we extracted the c@xmath0o @xmath15 spectrum and fitted a gaussian profile to it using splat if the peak of the c@xmath0o  line was @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rms spectral noise",
    ". we did not detect c@xmath0o  at the @xmath18 level towards 4 ( 5  per cent ) clfind  and 6 ( 5  per cent ) gaussclumps  positions . of the detections , 13 ( 15  per cent ) clfind  and 18 ( 15  per cent ) gaussclumps  spectra have double - peaked line profiles .",
    "for comparison , @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter ) made pointed n@xmath19h@xmath20 @xmath21 and c@xmath0o @xmath22 observations on the institut de radio astronomie millimtric ( iram ) 30-m telescope ( with beam sizes of 25 and 11arcsec respectively ) towards 157 candidate cores in perseus ",
    "44 pointings in our fields  and found 66 ( 42  per cent ) c@xmath0o  spectra required two component gaussian fits with three in one case .",
    "generally , @xmath22 data trace lower density ( @xmath23@xmath9 ) and/or colder material than the @xmath24 at lower optical depths by a factor of 23 in the optically thin limit .",
    "therefore the @xmath22 line is unlikely to saturate if the @xmath15 data are optically thin .",
    "this suggests there are separate emitting sources along the line - of - sight with different temperatures and/or densities which require multiple - component fits for one transition and not the other .",
    "an alternative is simply that at our velocity resolution ( 0.15kms@xmath5  compared to s 0.05kms@xmath5 ) many of s separate components are blended into one , which might partly explain our larger linewidths ( see  [ sec : linewidths ] ) .",
    "the linewidths in molecular clouds are substantially larger than the sound speed of their constituent gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such supersonic linewidths are thought to arise from chaotic and/or _ turbulent _ motions of unknown fundamental origin ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion in a region scales with its size ( e.g.  @xcite ) akin to the kolmogorov law for subsonic incompressible turbulence , although turbulence in the interstellar medium is actually highly compressible and often supersonic causing shocks .",
    "however , dense star - forming cores harboured in cloud interiors possess near - thermal linewidths almost devoid of the turbulent movements that cause the broadening in their outer envelopes ( e.g.  @xcite ) . the c@xmath0o @xmath1 transition is expected to probe a region intermediate in scale between the dense core and its environment , although it is not the tracer of choice for young prestellar cores . in the cold ( @xmath25k )",
    ", high - density ( @xmath26@xmath9 ) centres of such objects , the conditions may result in _ depletion _",
    ", where many molecules ( including co and its isotopologues ) freeze - out on to dust grains .",
    "such zones are better probed by molecules such as n@xmath19h@xmath20and h@xmath19d@xmath20 , but in any case the co @xmath1 transitions should probe higher densities than lower @xmath27 ones .",
    "we take a core s total one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath28 to be the quadrature sum of its thermal and non - thermal dispersions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively : @xmath31 to find @xmath30 ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : linewidths ] ) , we calculate @xmath29 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass of a proton and @xmath34 the relative molecular mass of c@xmath0o ( @xmath35 ) . the clump temperature , @xmath36 , is taken from the kinetic temperatures of ammonia gas @xcite , where available , or 10k and 15k for identified starless and protostellar cores respectively where not .",
    "for those clumps without a association we assume a temperature of 12k .",
    "we calculate the turbulent fraction , plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : fturb ] to [ fig : fturb_comp_proto ] , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the thermal sound speed in the bulk of the gas of mean molecular mass @xmath39 ( assuming 1 he for every 5 h@xmath19 ) and @xmath40 the adiabatic index ( @xmath41 for a diatomic molecule ) . for @xmath42k , @xmath43kms@xmath5  and at 15k @xmath44kms@xmath5 .",
    "summaries of @xmath45  for various populations are listed in tabs . [",
    "tab : fturbclfind ] and [ tab : fturbgclumps ] .",
    "a majority of the linewidths are supersonic with means @xmath46 ) and not simple standard deviations ( @xmath47 ) . ] and @xmath48 for the clfind  and gaussclumps  populations respectively .",
    "the level of non - thermal broadening should take into account motions from both : ( a ) the source itself i.e.  infall , rotation and outflows and ( b ) the source s natal environment .",
    "young stars can inject significant energy into their surroundings , increasing the non - thermal motions within nearby star - forming cores .",
    "for example @xcite found an inverse relationship between a core s nh@xmath49 linewidth and the distance to the nearest young stellar cluster in orion b. there are three such young clusters in perseus ( see @xcite ) : ic348 , ngc1333  and the per ob2 association .",
    "therefore , of our fields , ngc1333  and ic348 are very near to young clusters , while l1448 and l1455 are further away ( l1455 being the furthest ) .",

    "the results are broken into either different regions in perseus or clump classifications ( see  [ sec : clumpcats ] ) .",
