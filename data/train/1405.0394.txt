    "in his seminal paper , gribov showed that a standard gauge condition , such as the coulomb or the landau choices , fail to provide _ _ proper gauge fixings _ _ in yang - mills theories @xcite .",
    "this so - called gribov problem , that affects non - abelian gauge theories , means that a generic gauge fixing intersects the same gauge orbit more than once ( gribov copies ) and may fail to intersect others .",
    "algebraic gauge conditions free of gribov ambiguities are possible , but those choices are affected by severe technical problems as , for instance , incompatibility with the boundary conditions that must be imposed on the gauge fields in order to properly define the configuration space for the theory @xcite . additionally , singer @xcite showed that gribov ambiguities occur for all gauge fixing conditions involving derivatives ( see also @xcite ) , and moreover , the presence of the gribov problem breaks brst symmetry at a non - perturbative level @xcite .",
    "the gribov problem occurs because it is generically impossible to ensure positive definiteness of the faddeev - popov ( * fp * ) determinant everywhere in functional space .",
    "the configurations for which the the fp operator develops a nontrivial zero mode are those where the gauge condition becomes ` tangent ' to the gauge orbits and it therefore fails to intersect them .",
    "the gribov horizon ( * gh * ) , where this happens , marks the boundary beyond which the gauge condition intersects the gauge orbits more than once ( gribov copies ) .",
    "the appearance of gribov copies invalidates the usual approach to the path integral and one way to avoid overcounting is to restrict the sum over field configurations to the so - called gribov region around @xmath0 , where the fp operator is positive definite ( see , in particular , @xcite ) .    in the case of",
    "flat topologically trivial space - time , the restriction to the gribov region coincides with the usual perturbation theory around @xmath0 ( with respect to a suitable functional norm @xcite ) .",
    "the restriction to the first gribov region takes into account the infrared effects related to the _ partial _ elimination of the gribov copies , in the sense that it only guarantees the exclusion of those copies obtained by ( small \" ) gauge transformations perturbatively connected to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that non - perturbatively accessible gauge copies may exist within the gribov region as well if the space - time is not flat or is topologically nontrivial @xcite .",
    "the complete elimination of the gauge copies if the space is not flat or its topology is nontrivial can be a very difficult issue and here we do not consider those possibilities , restricting the path - integral to the first gribov region .",
    "remarkably enough , the partial elimination of gribov copies in perturbation theory is related to the non - perturbative infrared physics @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative input in the modified path - integral is the restriction to the gribov region .",
    "when one takes into account the presence of suitable condensates @xcite the agreement with lattice data is excellent @xcite .",
    "moreover , within this approach , it has been possible to solve an old issue on the casimir energy and force for the yang - mills field in the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "a common criticism to the gribov - zwanziger approach that restricts the functional space to the gribov region is that it goes against the feynman s postulate of summing over all histories .",
    "there are various arguments that answer this criticism .",
    "first of all , the configurations outside the gribov region are copies of some configuration inside the gribov region @xcite @xcite",
    ". therefore the gribov restriction avoids overcounting and no relevant physical configurations are lost .",
    "second and most importantly , this framework considerably improves the analytic results of standard perturbation theory like the glueball spectrum , which closely reproduces the lattice results @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to look for examples in a context simpler than yang - mills theory , in which the issue of the gribov restriction can be directly analyzed .",

    "the gribov - zwanziger restriction can be seen as a prescription consistent with the fact that it is respected by the dynamics , both classical and quantum mechanically , at least in finite dimensional hamiltonian systems .    in gauge systems with finite number of degrees of freedom",
    ", the existence of gribov ambiguity in the gauge fixing conditions leads to a degenerate symplectic structure for the reduced system : the degenerate surface in the reduced phase space is the gh restricted to the constraint surface .",
    "it is important to observe that , although in the flpr model the gribov ambiguity can be circumvented by choosing @xmath177 ( leading to the analog of the axial gauge in field theory ) , an analogous choice is not possible for yang - mills theories .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , in order to include relevant non - trivial configurations like instantons in the function space of the theory , certain boundary conditions must be imposed on the fields , which rule out algebraic gauge conditions ( see also @xcite ) . in this sense , a consistent analog of the limit @xmath234 for field theories does not exist , the gribov ambiguity is unavoidable for gauge theories , and degeneracies should be expected in the gauge - fixed system .",
    "as we have shown , when the requirement of regularity is not imposed , a non - degenerate gauge - fixed systems can be obtained .",
    "however this is not a solution to the problem .",
    "regularity is a key requirement for a set of constraints to be well defined , as irregularities lead to a lagrangian that does not describe the real dynamics of the original system .",
    "even if the generalization of our results to field theories seems conceptually straightforward , an interesting future direction for this work is to look for explicit degeneracies in the gauge - fixed symplectic form in theories of yang - mills type .",
    "the problem involves important technical difficulties in the definition of the reduced phase space when non - algebraic gauge conditions are adopted . in particular , when set strongly to zero , this kind of gauge conditions does not allow to express one field as local functions of the remaining ones , and a local action for the physical degrees of freedom with the reduced symplectic form is not available .",
    "these difficulties in the standard hamiltonian formulation for yang - mills theories make the path integral formalism better suited .",
    "however , an interesting novel hamiltonian approach to qcd , where dirac reduction is considered , has been recently developed in @xcite , which could be worth to study within this context .",
    "the fact that the gh is a degeneracy surface for the gauge fixed system , which persists at the quantum level , strongly supports the consistency of the gribov restriction for qcd , as the degeneracy divides phase space into causally disconnected regions . even though the gribov - zwanziger idea is heuristic and supported by the fact that every orbit intersects the gribov region @xcite ( which means that no physical information is lost if the restriction is applied ) ,",
    "the results it yields have gained acceptance by their match with the lattice data .",
