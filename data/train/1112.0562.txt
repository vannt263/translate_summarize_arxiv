    "the effect of gravitational microlensing of background stars by compact objects located in globular clusters was analyzed for the first time by @xcite .",
    "he showed that thanks to the usually well - known distances to the source and the lens , and transverse velocity between the populations to which the objects belong , it is possible to derive the lens mass when the event time scale is measured .",
    "paczyski suggested to monitor globular clusters like m22 or 47  tuc in front of the rich background of either the galactic bulge or the small magellanic cloud .",
    "according to his calculations one should detect up to a few microlensing events in one year of continuous monitoring of m22 with a 1  m class ground - based telescope .",
    "some microlensing events detected so far toward the bulge in microlensing surveys such as ogle @xcite , macho @xcite , and moa @xcite might be associated with globular clusters .",
    "@xcite presented the results of a search for erupting objects in the field of the globular cluster m22 .",
    "the cluster was observed over 10 weeks in 2000 - 2001 with the 1.0  m swope telescope at las campanas observatory as one of the targets of the cluster ages experiment ( case ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides two erupting dwarf novae they found a probable microlensing event located at @xmath318:36:22.40 , @xmath423:56:29.4 , i.e. , only 233 @xmath5 from the cluster center , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the core radius and half - mass radius of the cluster , respectively ( taken from the 2010 version of @xcite catalog ) .",
    "the brightness of the object increased by about 0.8  mag in @xmath8 over 20  days .",
    "around 2000 august  5 it reached a maximum of @xmath9  mag and then faded to a constant level of @xmath10  mag . based on its color at maximum brightness",
    "the authors excluded the possibility that the object could be a dwarf nova .",
    "they fitted a single lens model to the light curve and found that the most likely geometry of the event places the source in the galactic bulge and the lens in the cluster .",
    "the fitted parameters are : the epoch of maximum @xmath11 , characteristic ( einstein ) time @xmath12  days , impact parameter @xmath13 in units of einstein radius @xmath14 , @xmath15  mag , and @xmath16  mag , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath8-band magnitudes of the source and lens , respectively .",
    "the authors assessed the mass of the lens to @xmath19 .",
    "large uncertainties of the above values result from the faintness of the object and partial coverage of the event .",
    "after many years , in some special cases it is possible to directly detect the lens , measuring its mass and the geometry of the microlensing event ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    "we resolve the microlensing system components based on new near - ir high - resolution images , measuring the complete geometry of the event , and the parameters of the source and lens stars .",
    "the event reported here is the first confirmed microlensing event in a globular cluster .",
    "we note that brightening episodes detected in _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images of m22 by @xcite were later reexamined and interpreted either as a dwarf nova type outburst @xcite or as a result of cosmic ray double hits @xcite .",
    "@xmath20-band observations of the m22-microlens region were obtained at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) on 2011 july 17 , i.e. , 10.95 years after the maximum of the event . twenty single 110  s exposures were taken using naco at ut4 , composed of the nasmyth adaptive optics system ( naos ) and the high resolution ir camera and spectrometer ( conica ) .",
    "the detector was a 1026  @xmath21 1024 pixel sbrc insb alladin 3 array .",
    "we used the s27 camera of the scale 27.15  mas  pixel@xmath22 and the field of view of 28@xmath23@xmath2128@xmath23 .",
    "the telescope jittered after each exposure according to a random pattern in an 8@xmath23@xmath218@xmath23box .",
    "as the guide source for adaptive optics ( ao ) image correction we used a @xmath24  mag star located 1136 away from the target .",
    "the seeing during the observations ranged between 069 and 099 .",
    "the data were reduced with the eso software packages midas and eclipse . in the top panel of figure  1",
    "we show the combined image of the observed field .",
    "the image is affected by anisoplanatism , which degrades the point spread function ( psf ) making it more elongated with increasing angular distance from the guide star .",
    "the measured full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at the center of the image is 011 .",
    "the m22-microlens region was also observed with vlt / naco through the @xmath25 filter on 2011 april 26 .",
    "unfortunately , the measured fwhm of 036 is insufficient to detect the faint lens .    for our analysis we cut a smaller area of 600@xmath21600 pixels , covering 163@xmath21163 around the target microlens .",
    "we used daophot / allstar @xcite to extract photometry of stars in the image . due to relatively large difference in brightness ( @xmath26  mag ) and",
    "very small separation between the source and the lens ( @xmath27  mas ) the photometry was extracted in three steps . in the first step we found psf based on selected isolated bright stars . then using this psf we found centroids of all stars with s / n@xmath28 . in the second step",
    ", we removed the bright stars from the image and extracted profile photometry for residual objects , including the lens .",
    "the residual image showing the lens located slightly off the center is presented in the lower panel of figure  1 . in the final step ,",
    "we re - extracted the photometry for all stars including the positions of both the source and lens .",
    "we performed simulations in which we inserted the same pair of stars in the same location of 100 frames with subtracted stars in order to assess the errors of the positions of the two objects .",
    "the obtained mean uncertainties in pixels we converted into the unit of mas .",
    "standard @xmath20-band magnitudes of the stars within our field were calculated based on photometry of 51 neighboring stars detected in the near - ir vista variables in the via lactea survey ( vvv ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found the source and lens to have @xmath29  mag and @xmath30  mag , respectively .",
    "almost eleven ( 10.95 ) years after the microlensing event we found the lens located ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 )  mas ( east , south ) from the source .",
    "this corresponds to a relative proper motion of the lens with respect to the source @xmath33=[11.29\\pm0.17,-1.44\\pm0.17]$ ]  mas  yr@xmath22 and its total value @xmath34  mas  yr@xmath22 .",
    "based on archival _ hst _ observations @xcite measured the proper motion of the globular cluster m22 with respect to the background bulge stars .",
    "they obtained @xmath33=[10.19 \\pm 0.20,-3.34 \\pm 0.10]$ ]  mas  yr@xmath22 and showed that the separation between cluster and field stars is clear .",
    "they considered all stars with proper motions @xmath35  mas  yr@xmath22 around the mean value of the cluster to be m22 members , and stars with motions @xmath36  mas  yr@xmath22 as mainly bulge stars . in a vector - point diagram presented in figure  2",
    "we overlaid the vector measured here for the microlens on the vector for the bulge - m22 set from @xcite .",
    "the microlens vector originates from the ( 0 , 0 ) point , which refers to the cluster , and ends well within the bulge area .",
    "this confirms the geometry of the microlensing event with the source in the bulge and the lens in the globular cluster .    by fitting a model to the light curve @xcite",
    "predicted that the lens is fainter than the source by @xmath37  mag in the @xmath8 band . at a distance @xmath38  kpc and mean reddening @xmath39  mag @xcite it is likely an m5 dwarf of an absolute brightness @xmath40  mag .",
    "such star observed in the @xmath20 band would have @xmath41  mag ( based on models from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the brightness of the faint object detected close to the target source in the vlt / naco image is @xmath30  mag , which is in excellent agreement .",
    "the vlt / naco @xmath20-band image is the only available image containing both microlensing system components .",
    "we searched the _ hst _ archives for other high - resolution images .",
    "unfortunately , in two _",
    "hst_/_advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs )",
    "images taken as a part of the go 10775 program on 2006 apr  1 our target lies 13 off the edge .",
    "the only _ hst _ image ( jb1w01010 , go 11558 ) covering the m22 microlens was obtained on 2010 mar  2 in the o[iii ] filter centered at 5023  and with fwhm=86 .",
    "we checked that in this narrow - band filter all objects of similar brightness to the lens in the naco image are below the detection limit .",
    "this supports the fact that the lens is a relatively red object .",
    "we also checked brightness variations of the target object in recent ogle data obtained with the 1.3  m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment during its fourth phase ( ogle - iv ) , that started in 2010 march , observes the globular cluster m22 occasionally once or twice a week . in figure  3",
    "we present the @xmath42-band light curve of the target object in years 2010 - 2011 .",
    "the zero point accuracy of the magnitude scale is about 0.1  mag .",
    "constant brightness of the object within 0.2  mag corroborates that the episode of increasing brightness in 2000 july / august was a single event .",
    "theoretically we can estimate the probability of a chance configuration of two unrelated stars in the investigated area .",
    "we detected 342 stars in a brightness range @xmath43  mag in the 15@xmath23@xmath2115@xmath23  field centered on the target source .",
    "assuming poisson statistics this gives a density of @xmath44 stars arcsec@xmath45 or @xmath46 stars within 124.6  mas around the target .",
    "eighty - two stars ( corresponding to a fraction of 0.240 ) , being fainter than @xmath47  mag , could act as a potential lens in our case . the acceptable position angle of the lens ranges within @xmath48 off the m22-bulge relative proper motion direction , decreasing the chance by 0.214 . if we take into account all above requirements we find @xmath49%@xmath50% chance of such configuration at any location in the field .",
    "however , the observed position and brightness of both lens and source being in perfect agreement with the expectations unambiguously confirm the microlensing nature and geometry of the event detected in 2000 .",
    "the observed @xmath20-band brightness of the lensing star and the fact that it is located in the globular cluster m22 allows us to determine its type . according to @xcite m22 lies at a distance @xmath51  kpc from the sun and has an average metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath52  dex in scale . reddening in the direction of m22 is spread between @xmath53 and 0.42  mag . using @xcite relations on absorption , that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , we find @xmath56  mag for objects in m22 . from this",
    "we obtain the absolute brightness of the lens @xmath57  mag . based on models from @xcite",
    "we find the mass of the star @xmath58 ( see figure  4 ) .    knowing the distance to the lensing object @xmath59 , its mass @xmath60 , relative proper motion @xmath61 between the source and lens , and time scale of the event",
    "@xmath62 we can estimate distance to the source from the following relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the gravity constant and @xmath65 the speed of light .",
    "the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 should be given in either heliocentric or geocentric frame .",
    "for the microlens in m22 we obtain @xmath66  kpc which places the source in the galactic bulge , as expected from the relative motion .",
    "the large errors reflect mainly the uncertainty in the estimated duration of the microlensing event .    according to @xcite the total reddening in the cluster direction amounts to @xmath67  mag .",
    "that implies that any stars located in the cluster field can not be significantly more reddened than the cluster itself .",
    "if we assume the same absorption for the source located at 6.0  kpc as for the cluster , @xmath68  mag , from the observed brightness of the source @xmath69  mag we find it to be a solar - type star @xcite .",
    "location of this object in a @xmath20 versus o[iii]@xmath70 diagram shown in figure  5 supports this conclusion .",
    "in the letter we have shown that the microlensing event which occurred @xmath71 from the center of the globular cluster m22 in 2000 july / august involved a @xmath1 dwarf of the cluster and a background solar - like star located in the galactic bulge .",
    "almost 11 years after the event , using high - resolution near - ir image we resolved the two microlensing components .",
    "the observed position of the source and lens stars as well as their brightness are consistent with the proposed earlier geometry of the event .",
    "additional evidence comes from the constant brightness of the target object in the last two years ( 2010 - 2011 ) .",
