    "second , no signals can travel faster than the speed of light .",
    "the two assumptions lead to restrictions commonly referred to as bell inequalities .",
    "the fundamental result is that such restrictions on correlations are overcome within quantum mechanics @xcite . today , a role of bell inequalities widely ranges from the foundations @xcite up to applications in quantum information processing like quantum key distillation @xcite and randomness expansion @xcite . in a certain sense ,",
    "leggett  garg inequalities @xcite are closely related to the bell issue .",
    "in contrast to bell inequalities , leggett  garg inequalities probe correlations of a single system measured at different times . a theoretical background , experimental tests and some proposals for leggett  garg inequalities are summarized in the review @xcite .    like the locality , the noncontextuality assumption is also natural from the classical viewpoint .",
    "in quantum theory , this pertains only to mutually compatible observables . mutually commuting observables are simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "hence , performed measurement of one of such observables does not stipulate results of further measurements of other .",

    "this result known as the kochen  specker theorem was independently obtained by bell ( for details , see ref .",
    "the recent paper @xcite focused on the causality , which is also deeply rooted in our understanding of the macro world . in quantum mechanics , it is possible to conceive situations in which a single event can be both , a cause and an effect of another one @xcite . as discussed results concern measurement statistics , they are statements about probability distributions . in general , there are various ways to express probabilistic properties .",

    "we consider an example with five quantities for a three - dimensional quantum system .",
    "in this section , we examine @xmath0-entropic inequalities of the bell type for the kcbs scenario . in the case",

    "@xcite , we consider five projectors of the form @xmath182 with the normalized eigenvectors @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "the five vectors satisfy orthogonality constraints @xmath185 hence , two projectors @xmath182 and @xmath186 are jointly measurable for all @xmath187 .",

    "the vectors ( [ 123a])([45a ] ) also obey @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "further , we write the measure state as @xmath193 for which @xmath194 and @xmath195 . some intuitive reasons for such a configuration are briefly discussed in ref .",

    "we especially focus an attention on values , which are very close to @xmath188 from below . as calculations show , for fixed @xmath0 the ratio @xmath196 decreases with such @xmath45 almost linearly , up to the inefficiency - free value @xmath197 . due to almost linear dependence",

    "this conclusion concurs with the efficiency @xmath136 , which was claimed in ref .",

    "a novel point is that , for given @xmath45 , the ratio ( [ rqet ] ) essentially depends also on @xmath0 . among @xmath0-entropic inequalities for the kcbs scenario with observables ( [ 123a])([45a ] ) , the choice @xmath53 can be recognized as very appropriate .",
    "first , the value of @xmath201 for @xmath53 is almost maximal in comparison with other ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "second , the ratio ( [ rqet ] ) in the second model of detection inefficiencies is sufficiently small for @xmath202 ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "in the paper , we have expressed bell s theorem in terms of the conditional @xmath0-entropies of order @xmath1 . formally , the presented inequalities are based on several useful properties of the conditional @xmath0-entropy .",
    "one of them is the well - known chain rule .",
    "other required properties are proved as lemmas [ lem0 ] and [ lem1 ] .",
    "the latter result is combined with the chain rule in deriving new @xmath0-entropic inequalities of bell s type .",
    "the statement of lemma [ lem0 ] is used to study the more realistic case with detection inefficiencies .",
    "the result of lemma [ lem1 ] holds for @xmath1 and generalizes analogous property of the standard conditional entropy . from the physical viewpoint ,",
    "the noncontextuality hypothesis is a key ingredient of the derivation . assuming the existence of a joint probability distribution for the outcomes of all observations , we have arrived at a principal conclusion .",
    "namely , the corresponding conditional @xmath0-entropies of order @xmath1 should satisfy inequalities of the form ( [ rthm ] ) .",
    "this claim generalizes the previous entropic formulations of bell s theorem . in particular , the inequality ( [ comb3 ] ) is a @xmath0-parametric extension of the braunstein  caves inequality @xcite .",
    "thus , we have shown that the noncontextuality hypothesis leads to the entire family of @xmath0-entropic inequalities of bell s type .",
    "it turns out that these inequalities are incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics for many values of the parameters .    with the standard conditional entropy",
    ", violations of entropic bell inequalities were examined for the chsh scenario in refs .",
    "@xcite and for the kcbs scenario in refs .",
    "we have explicitly considered violations of the @xmath0-entropic inequalities in both the scenarios .",
    "the following principal conclusions can be made .",
    "first , the derived @xmath0-entropic inequalities allow to expand significantly a class of probability distributions , for which the nonlocality or contextuality are testable in this way .",
    "second , the @xmath0-entropic inequalities are expedient in analyzing cases with detection inefficiencies . in the single - detector model ,",
    "features of the @xmath0-entropic inequalities are quite similar to features of usual inequalities in terms of the shannon entropies . in the two - detector model ,",
    "use of the @xmath0-entropic inequalities can allow to reduce an amount of required detection efficiency .",
    "the obtained conclusions for various values @xmath1 could be tested in the experiments . for conventional bell",
    "s inequality in terms of average values , quantum violation is limited by the tsirelson bound .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain upper bounds on possible violations of @xmath0-entropic inequalities of bell s type . due to",
