    "recently a major scientific effort has been devoted to the characterization and modeling of a wide range of social and natural systems that can be described as networks @xcite .",
    "systems such as the internet @xcite or the world - wide - web @xcite , social communities @xcite , food - webs @xcite , and biological interacting networks @xcite can be represented as a graph @xcite , in which nodes represent the population individuals and links the physical interactions among them .",
    "strikingly , many of these networks have complex topological properties and dynamical features that can not be accounted for by classical graph modeling @xcite . in particular , small - world properties @xcite and scale - free degree distributions @xcite ( where the degree or connectivity of a node is defined as the number of other nodes to which it is attached ) seem to emerge frequently as dominant features governing the topology of real - world networks .",
    "these global properties imply a large connectivity heterogeneity and a short average distance between nodes , which have considerable impact on the behavior of physical processes taking place on top of the network .",
    "for instance , scale - free ( sf ) networks have been shown to be resilient to random damage ( absence of a percolation transition ) @xcite and prone to epidemic spreading ( null epidemic threshold ) @xcite .",
    "the detailed scrutiny of the topological properties of networks has pointed out that small - world and scale - free properties come often along with non - trivial degree correlations and clustering properties .",
    "recently , an interesting class of networks has been introduced by klemm and eguluz by proposing a growing model in which nodes are progressively deactivated with a probability inversely proportional to their connectivity @xcite .",
    "analytical arguments and numerical simulations have lead to the claim that , under general conditions , the deactivation model , allowing a core of @xmath0 active nodes , generates a network with average degree @xmath1 and degree probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the scale - free properties are associated to a high clustering coefficient .",
    "for this reason the deactivation model has been used to study how clustering can alter the picture obtained for the resilience to damage and epidemic spreading in sf networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the analysis of the deactivation model .",
    "we find an analytical solution in the case of minimal values of active nodes @xmath0 ( low average connectivity ) .",
    "in addition , large scale numerical simulations exhibits a noticeable variability of the degree distribution with @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the degree exponent strongly depends on @xmath0 for the general case considered in ref .",
    "the model topology is also susceptible to several details of the construction algorithm . by means of large - scale numerical simulations we study the deactivation model topology in the whole range of @xmath0 and for different algorithm parameters .",
    "we calculate analytically the clustering coefficient and connectivity correlation functions .",
    "also in this case a variability with respect to the model parameters is found .",
    "extensive numerical simulations confirm the analytical picture presented here .    in the generated networks , we also report the lack of small - world properties .",
    "in the whole parameters range we find a network diameter increasing linearly with the number of nodes forming the network @xcite .",
    "the networks topology is therefore similar to an array of connected star - shaped graphs .",
    "the networks are thus similar to a one dimensional lattice in what concerns their physical properties .",
    "in particular , diffusion and spreading processes might be heavily affected by the increasing average distance among nodes that make the system alike to a one - dimensional chain . in this perspective",
    ", we discuss the properties of epidemic spreading and resilience to damage in networks generated with the deactivation model .",
    "the deactivation model introduced by klemm and eguluz @xcite is defined as follows : consider a network with directed links .",
    "each node can be in two states , either active or inactive .",
    "the model starts from a completely connected graph of @xmath0 active nodes and proceeds by adding new nodes one by one .",
    "each time a node is added :    1 .",
    "it is connected to all active nodes in the network ; 2 .",
    "one of the active nodes is selected and set inactive with probability @xmath3^{-1}}{a+{k^{\\rm in}}_i } ;    \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] 3 .",
    "the new node is set active .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) runs over the set of active nodes @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a model parameter , and @xmath6 denotes the in - degree of the @xmath7-th node .    as we shall show below , this model is quite sensitive to the order in which steps 2 and 3 are performed and , therefore , it is better to discriminate the following cases .    *",
    "_ model a _ : step 2 is performed _ before _",
    "step 3 . * _ model b _ : step 2 is performed _",
    "after _ step 3 .    for @xmath8",
    "both models can be solved analytically in the continuous @xmath9 approximation , after introducing the probability density that an active node has in - degree @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "moreover in this limit the order of steps 2 and 3 is irrelevant , obtaining the same in - degree distribution @xmath10 with @xmath11 the model is usually simulated by using @xmath12 . in this way",
    "the deactivation probability is inversely proportional to the total connectivity of the nodes @xmath13 and the connectivity distribution results to be @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , due to the deactivation mechanism the networks show a high clustering coefficient that approaches a constant value in the infinite size limit  @xcite .    at lower values of @xmath0",
    ", it has been claimed that finite size effects set in and the connectivity distribution shows deviations from the predicted behavior .",
    "we shall see in the next section that for @xmath14 the model presents a very different analytical solution which yields a connectivity distribution very far from the @xmath8 limit .",
    "in addition , the deactivation model topology is very sensible to changes in the details of the growing algorithms .",
    "let us first focus on model a with @xmath15 , that is the smallest value of @xmath0 for which the model is non - trivial . in this case , after adding a new node we have only two nodes at the deactivation step .",
    "one of them will be set inactive and replaced by the new added node , that has in - degree @xmath16 . in the worst case , the other node will have in - degree @xmath17 , the @xmath16 coming from its initial in - degree and the @xmath18 from the connection to the newly added node , and in general it will have in - degree larger than or equal to @xmath19 .",
    "later on , at the next deactivation step , the in - degrees of both nodes will have increased by one resulting in one active node with in - degree @xmath18 and another with in - degree @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the in - degree of the active node with largest in - degree , that coincides with the oldest node .",
    "then , following eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , one of them will be deactivated with probability @xmath22 each time the oldest node is not deactivated its in - degree increases by one and , therefore , the probability that the oldest node has in - degree @xmath21 is just the probability that it is not deactivated in @xmath23 steps , with running in - degree @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath25 of creating a deactivated node of in - degree @xmath21 is equal to the probability that the largest node is not deactivated in @xmath23 steps and is deactivated in the last step , _",
    "i.e. _ : @xmath26p_d(k ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\gamma(3 + 2a)}{\\gamma(1+a)}\\frac{\\gamma(a+k)}{\\gamma(2 + 2a+k ) } , \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the standard gamma function @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "every time that the oldest node is not deactivated , the other , with in - degree @xmath18 , is deactivated .",
    "hence , in the @xmath28 deactivation steps leading to the generation of a node with in - degree @xmath21 , @xmath23 nodes with in - degree @xmath18 are created .",
    "the average number of nodes with in - degree @xmath18 created in the process is then @xmath29 therefore , the in - degree distribution will be given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant , obtained from the normalization condition @xmath32 , that has the value @xmath33 from this equation , we obtain the analytic expression for the in - degree distribution @xmath34 for large @xmath9 we can expand the previous expression using stirling s approximation , to obtain that the in - degree distribution follows the asymptotic behavior @xmath35 moreover , since the out - degree of all nodes is @xmath0 then the degree @xmath36 of a node ( in - degree plus out - degree ) is @xmath37 and will follow the same distribution shifted by @xmath0 .",
    "for the particular case @xmath38 , the degree distribution takes the form @xmath39    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot the degree distribution obtained from numerical simulations of model @xmath40 for @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath15 the numerical points are in very good agreement with the exact distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) , with a power law decay with exponent @xmath41 . in the limiting case of large @xmath0",
    "the continuous approach predicts the exponent 3  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) ) , giving us a lower bound .",
    "hence , @xmath42 and , therefore , the degree distribution has always a bounded second moment . for larger @xmath0",
    "the distribution follows a power law decay but with an exponent @xmath43 that depends on @xmath0 . in order to show that the degree distribution approaches for each @xmath0 an asymptotic power law behavior with @xmath44 we performed large scale simulations of networks with @xmath45 nodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we report the behavior of the exponent @xmath43 as a function of @xmath0 . for all values of @xmath46",
    "the degree exponents strongly deviates from the @xmath8 limit .      using similar arguments we can compute the degree distribution of model b for @xmath47 . in this case",
    "we also have two nodes at the deactivation process , the one just added and the one surviving from the previous deactivation step .",
    "the former has in - degree @xmath16 while the latter ( the oldest ) has in - degree @xmath48 , and one of them is deactivated with probability @xmath49 the probability that when the oldest node is deactivated it has degree @xmath21 is given by @xmath50p_d(k ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\gamma(1 + 2a)}{\\gamma(a)}\\frac{\\gamma(a+k)}{\\gamma(1 + 2a+k)}. \\label{eq:5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the process of creating a node of in - degree @xmath21 , @xmath28 nodes of in - degree @xmath16 have been created .",
    "the average number of nodes with in - degree @xmath16 created is @xmath51 thus , the analytic expression for the normalized in - degree distribution is given by @xmath52 with the normalization constant @xmath53 from here follows the expression for the degree distribution ( where @xmath54 ) @xmath55 for large @xmath36 the degree distribution follows the asymptotic behavior @xmath56    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the degree distribution obtained from numerical simulations of model b with @xmath12 . for @xmath57",
    "we recover the predicted exponent @xmath58 .",
    "also in this case , we provide large scale numerical simulations ( @xmath45 ) of networks with larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained distributions still follow a power law decay but with an exponent @xmath43 that is a continuously increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth remarking that for @xmath59 the degree exponent is stable and strongly differs from the value @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth noticing that for @xmath57 the analytic solution eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) is singular , as can be readily seen from the @xmath61 factor in the denominator .",
    "in fact , the solution in this case is @xmath62 , that is , in the thermodynamic limit ( infinitely large network ) , the weight of the nodes with degree @xmath18 is overwhelming with respect to the nodes with different connectivity .",
    "this singularity is rooted in the fact that the distribution , with exponent @xmath58 , lacks a finite first moment in the thermodynamic limit , while we know that , by definition , model @xmath63 has average connectivity @xmath64 .",
    "this necessarily implies that there must be an implicit dependence on the network size @xmath65 in the degree distribution for @xmath57 , dependence that can not be assessed by our analytic solution since we are already working in the infinite network limit .",
    "we can nevertheless estimate the functional form of the degree distribution for a finite network composed by @xmath65 nodes , which has a maximum connectivity @xmath66 , such that there are no nodes with degree larger that @xmath66 . assuming that the distribution for @xmath67 follows the same functional form as eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , we have that for @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants to be determined by the normalization conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the upper limit in the first normalization condition can be taken to be infinite , since the corrections stemming from @xmath66 are of lower order ) . from this two conditions we obtain , in the continuous @xmath36 approximation that replaces sums by integrals , @xmath74 for finite sf networks with degree distribution @xmath75 , the maximum degree @xmath66 scales with the number of nodes as @xmath76 @xcite . in the present case we have @xmath77 , and",
    "thus , for large @xmath65 , @xmath78 therefore , in the limit @xmath79 , we recover a singular degree distribution with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we can check numerically this result by noticing that , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) and  ( [ eq:16 ] ) , the degree distribution at fixed @xmath36 should scale as @xmath82 we have verified this scaling form in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "therefore , in model b with @xmath57 we obtain a degree distribution that decays as @xmath83 , but with a normalization constant for @xmath67 that decays with the network size as @xmath84 .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the second moment of the distribution is diverging as @xmath85 . despite this singular behavior for @xmath57 ,",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] ) remains exact for any value of @xmath86 .    from the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , together with the upper bound @xmath60 obtained from the large @xmath0 approximation  @xcite , we have that @xmath87 and , therefore , the degree distribution has a divergent second moment .",
    "the analysis made above has shown that the deactivation model is quite sensitive to the order in which steps 2 and 3 are performed , yielding degree distributions with a finite or divergent second moment , depending on the order .",
    "in addition , the exponent @xmath43 is rather sensible to the value of @xmath12 , showing a wide range of variation .",
    "this fact has not been noticed in previous works where this model has been considered @xcite , prompting that some of the conclusions obtained in those works should be reconsidered in this perspective .",
    "we can go beyond the degree distribution and compute the clustering coefficient @xmath88 , as a function of the node degree @xmath36 @xcite . for this quantity we can perform an analytic calculation for any value of @xmath5 and @xmath0 and for both models a and b. in order to compute the clustering coefficient",
    ", we will consider the network as undirected and denote by @xmath89 the total degree of the node @xmath7 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the node @xmath7 is defined by @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of edges between the neighbors of node @xmath7 and it is divided by its maximum possible value @xmath92 . in the deactivation model",
    "new edges are created between the active nodes and the added node .",
    "hence , @xmath91 remains constant for inactive nodes and increases only for the active ones .",
    "moreover , all the active nodes are connected .",
    "hence , each time we add a node the degree @xmath93 of each active node @xmath7 increases by one and @xmath91 increases by @xmath94 , where @xmath94 are just the new links between the new neighbor of @xmath7 ( the added node ) and the remaining active nodes .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of @xmath91 is given by @xmath95 while the connectivity obeys the relation @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97 corresponds to the time at which the node @xmath7 was created .",
    "besides , when the node is added it has degree @xmath0 , thus @xmath98 and , therefore , @xmath99 . integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) with this initial condition and substituting the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , taking into account that @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath101 where the last expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) is obtained after some algebraic manipulations .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) recover the result previously obtained in ref.@xcite . for @xmath47",
    "the network is a tree , and therefore we obviously recover @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath15 we obtain the exact behavior @xmath103 . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath36 is @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we recover in this model the same behavior of @xmath88 found in other systems in ref .  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we plot the clustering coefficient as a function of the node degree obtained for model a and b and different values of @xmath0 from numerical simulations . as it can be seen",
    "the numerical dependency coincides with the analytical expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "degree correlations can be characterized by analyzing the nearest neighbor average degree introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , defined as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the sum of the degrees of the neighbors of node @xmath7 . in uncorrelated networks , the quantity @xmath108 does not show any dependence on the degree of the node @xmath7 .",
    "this is not the case when degree correlations are present . in this case",
    "@xmath108 is a function of the degree of the node whose nearest neighbors are analyzed . in particular , we can face two possible kinds of correlation . in the first situation",
    ", nodes with high connectivity will connect more preferably to highly connected nodes ; a property referred to as `` assortative mixing '' . on the opposite side , it is possible to have `` dissortative mixing '' ; i.e. highly connected nodes are preferably connected to nodes with low connectivity @xcite .    in the deactivation model , when the node is added it has degree @xmath0 and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the average degree among active neighbors .",
    "then , if the node @xmath7 is active , it is , by construction , neighbor of the @xmath94 remaining active nodes .",
    "thus , every time a new node is added , @xmath93 increases by one and @xmath107 increases by @xmath111 , the @xmath94 because the degree of the remaining @xmath94 neighbors have also increase by one and the @xmath0 because the new neighbor has degree @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath112 for each active node @xmath7 . integrating this equation , taking into account the initial condition @xmath113 and the relation @xmath100",
    ", we obtain that @xmath114 when the node @xmath7 is deactivated .",
    "now , when an active node becomes inactive its degree remains fixed but the degree of its active neighbor nodes will still increase until they get deactivated . therefore , in the infinite time limit , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the increase of @xmath107 , since node @xmath7 was set inactive until all its neighbors are set inactive .    hence , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , ( [ eq:11a ] ) , and ( [ eq:11b ] ) , it follows that @xmath117 it remains now the task to assess the possible dependence of @xmath116 on the connectivity @xmath93 ( it is clear that the long time average of @xmath110 must be independent of the connectivity of any deactivated node ) .",
    "for the minimum @xmath0 ( @xmath15 for model a and @xmath47 for model b ) the degree of an active node set inactive is not correlated with the degree of the remaining active nodes , since those remaining nodes have always degrees @xmath19 and @xmath118 in model a with @xmath15 , and degree @xmath18 in model b with @xmath47 , independently of the degree of the last deactivated node . therefore in this case @xmath116 can not depend on @xmath93 .",
    "this lack of correlations is also clear for @xmath119 where the sum @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is a constant @xcite and , therefore , the degree of the active nodes in not correlated with the degree of the inactive nodes . for intermediate values of @xmath0 , however , the degree of the active nodes may be correlated in such a way that @xmath116 depends on @xmath93 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we plot the dependency of the average nearest neighbors degree @xmath121 as a function of the degree @xmath36 for models a and b and different values of @xmath0 . in the case of model",
    "a , @xmath122 even for @xmath123 , in agreement with eq .  ( [ eq:12 ] ) . in the case of model",
    "b , @xmath122 for the @xmath47 and @xmath124 but decays faster for intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in this case the correlations between the active node degrees introduce stronger deviations for intermediate values of @xmath0 . in all cases , however , we find that correlations in the deactivation model are of `` disassortative '' nature ; _ i.e. _ highly connected nodes are preferably connected with poorly connected nodes .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the results for model b with @xmath47 must be taken with a grain of salt , given the singular nature of the model exposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model - b ] .    in the deactivation model , either a or b , for a fixed network size @xmath65 and assuming that @xmath116 does not grow faster than @xmath93",
    ", we have that in the limit @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "that is , the average nearest neighbor degree of the hubs ( nodes with largest @xmath93 ) equals @xmath127 , as previously pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , this fact does not necessarily imply that @xmath116 is independent of @xmath65 .",
    "one way to check this point is to compute the average of @xmath108 over all nodes , @xmath128 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is depending on @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath116 is approaching a constant value , we should obtain @xmath131 const .",

    "[ fig:5 ] we show how @xmath132 behaves with increasing @xmath65 for @xmath12 . for model",
    "a , where @xmath133 , it approaches a stationary value for @xmath134 .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic limit of @xmath132 increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , with increasing @xmath0 the exponent @xmath43 decreases approaching the limit @xmath60 for @xmath135 , where @xmath136 diverges logarithmically with @xmath65 . on the contrary , for model b , where @xmath137 , @xmath132 is growing with @xmath65 following a power law .",
    "this implies that @xmath116 is a diverging function of @xmath65 and that in the thermodynamic limit ( in which we perform first the limit @xmath79 ) the average nearest neighbor connectivity curve is progressively shifting to larger and larger values .",
    "this finally points out that the average nearest neighbor connectivity of hubs is not a well - defined quantity since the @xmath138 limit must be performed only after the @xmath79 limit .",
    "the divergence of @xmath132 with @xmath65 is related to a general property of sf networks with diverging connectivity fluctuations and it is dictated by the detailed balance of connectivity  @xcite .",
    "another fundamental topological feature of complex networks is identified by the scaling of the average path length among nodes and the network s diameter .",
    "the minimum path between two nodes is given by the minimum number of intermediate nodes that must be traversed to go from node to node .",
    "the average minimum path length @xmath139 is thus defined as the minimum path distance averaged over all the possible pairs of nodes in the network .",
    "similarly , the network diameter is defined as the largest among the shortest paths between any two nodes in the network .",
    "while regular networks ( for instance hypercubic lattices ) have a diameter scaling with the size @xmath65 as the inverse of the euclidean dimension , many complex networks show striking small - world properties ; _ i.e. _ in average one can go from one node to any other node in the system by passing through a very small number of intermediate nodes @xcite . in this case",
    "the graph diameter grows logarithmically , or even slower , with the system s number of nodes @xmath65 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been noticed that for large @xmath0 values @xmath139 is scaling linearly with the network size @xmath65 . in the deactivation model ( a and b ) we measured both the diameter and the average minimum path distance @xmath139 as a function of @xmath65 for values of @xmath12 ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath140 . in all cases",
    "we find that after a small size transient both metrics approach a linear scaling with @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we report the results obtained in the case of the deactivation model with rule b. this evidence implies that the topology of the generated networks is approaching those of a one dimensional lattice . in other words ,",
    "the deactivation model does not exhibit small - world properties .    in order to provide a visual representation of the deactivation model topology",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] the illustration of a network generated with model b and @xmath141 .",
    "the linear structure of the network is evident .",
    "in particular , we find a long chain of sequentially connected star - like structures .",
    "the star - like structures correspond to groups of nodes connected to a node which has been active for longer times and has had the possibility to develop a high number of connections .",
    "once these hubs are deactivated , they do not receive any further connection .",
    "the network grows by adding bridge nodes which are rapidly deactivated , until a new star - like structure is developed by a node that is active long enough .",
    "the growth mechanism , however , does not allow the formation of shortcuts between the deactivated region of the network and the new active nodes , hindering the development of small - world properties .",
    "the linear chain is therefore reflecting the time evolution of the structure : recently added nodes are separated from the original core of active nodes by a sequence of deactivated nodes that increases proportionally to the network size . by inspecting networks with larger @xmath0 we find very similar structures , with an increasing size of the star - like structures forming the linear chain .",
    "as we shall discuss in the last section , the absence of small - world properties might have a relevant effect in many physical properties of the network .",
    "in the present work we have provided a detailed analysis of the deactivation model introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the model shows a rich behavior , being very sensible to the value of the parameters used in the model and slight variations of the growing algorithm .",
    "the most striking result is that the degree distribution is depending on the value of the number of simultaneously active nodes @xmath0 also in the case in which @xmath12 ; _ i.e. _ when the deactivation probability is related to the nodes total degree .",
    "the degree exponent is asymptotically approaching the value @xmath60 only for @xmath8 , and the sf properties of networks suffer large variations in the range @xmath142 .",
    "along with the high clustering observed in previous works , we find that the model exhibits interesting degree correlation properties . in particular , we find marked disassortative mixing properties ; _ i.e. _ highly connected nodes link preferably to poorly connected nodes . the analytical expression for the degree correlation is obtained and recovered by numerical simulations .",
    "strikingly , the sf and correlation properties are not associated with small - world properties .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that for all values of @xmath0 the network diameter is increasing linearly with the number of nodes .",
    "the network thus approaches a linear structure , lacking long - range shortcuts .",
    "one of the most interesting issues related to sf networks is the effects of their complex topological features on the dynamics of spreading phenomena  @xcite and the onset of percolation transitions  @xcite . in the case of random sf networks , where degree correlations are absent",
    ", it has been found that the epidemic threshold is proportional to @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "uncorrelated sf networks allow the onset of large epidemics whatever the spreading rate of the infection .",
    "this is a noticeable result that has a large impact in immunization as well as control and design policies in real networks @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "most real networks show non - trivial degree correlations and clustering properties as it is the case in the present deactivation model .",
    "similarly , the random removal of nodes does not destroy the connectivity of sf networks with @xmath144 .",
    "in other words the percolation transition is absent , and the networks are extremely robust to random damages @xcite . a natural question is to know whether or not the clustering properties of sf networks plus their correlations alter the general results obtained for uncorrelated networks . for this reason , several recent works have addressed the effect of such correlations in the epidemic spreading occurring on these networks @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been claimed the existence of an epidemic threshold in the case of the deactivation model for rule b.    the presence of a finite threshold in the deactivation model has been traced back to the high clustering coefficient and the finite limit of the average nearest neighbor connectivity of the largest hubs  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown here that the average nearest neighbor connectivity in the system is diverging with the system size .",
    "what appears as more fundamental for the properties of spreading in the deactivation model is its linear structure , with a diameter that increases with @xmath65 . in a coarse grained picture ,",
    "the epidemic spreading is dominated by the diffusion of the disease on a linear chain . in order to check this point ,",
    "we have simulated a standard random walk in the b model with @xmath145 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we plot the mean - square displacement of the random walker , @xmath146 ^ 2 \\right>^{1/2}$ ] , where the brackets denote an average over @xmath147 realizations of the random walk on @xmath147 different networks . for a purely diffusive system ,",
    "as would be the case of a one dimensional lattice , we would expect a scaling @xmath148 .",
    "for the deactivation model we observe a slightly subdiffusive behavior , with a mean - square displacement scaling as @xmath149 .",
    "we thus conclude that dynamics on the deactivation model is almost purely diffusive , as expected from its non small - world character .",
    "the analysis of spreading and percolation properties in this network can not therefore be performed at the mean - field level @xcite , but must include diffusion and most probably fluctuations , leading to a much more complex formalism based in a field theory @xcite . for the sake of comparison , we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] the mean - square displacement of a random walker on a barabsi - albert network @xcite and on a internet snapshot map from 1999 , collected by the national laboratory for applied network research ( nlanr ) @xcite . as we observe , in these last two networks @xmath150",
    "saturates very quickly to a constant value , proportional to the network s diameter , indicating the presence of a strong small - world component .",
    "the essential difference of the diffusive properties between the internet and the deactivation model does not allow to extend the conclusions obtained from the model to the spreading in the real system .",
    "the same applies to percolation properties , that naturally exhibit a finite threshold in this case .",
    "the fact that spreading and percolation properties on the deactivation model are similar to those of regular lattices because of the absence of small - world features is corroborated by the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that shows how the introduction of a small amount of shortcuts restores the usual absence of a percolation threshold .",
    "in this perspective , it would be extremely interesting to have a detailed study of the epidemic spreading properties in the case of the deactivation model with random rewiring  @xcite , in order to assess the effect of clustering and degree correlations in spreading processes in sf networks with small - world properties .",
