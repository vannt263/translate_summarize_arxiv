    "the measurement of the position of a particle is perhaps the most basic quantum - mechanical measurement , but it poses many subtleties . the archetype for a position measurement is the heisenberg microscope  the imaged detection of light scattered from the particle . here",
    "we consider photodetection of the light emitted by a single two - level atom .",
    "if the photons first pass through a lens designed to form an image of the atom before detection , then the photodetections provide information about the location of the atom .",
    "the detections therefore modify the spatial wave function of the atom .",
    "this situation was first considered by holland _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , as a tool for the efficient simulation of atomic decoherence due to spontaneous emission . as applications",
    ", they considered spatial flights correlated with quantum jumps , and lvy statistics due to trapping in potential wells of an optical lattice  @xcite .    under the proper conditions ,",
    "this type of imaged photodetection can lead to the standard form of a continuous position measurement  @xcite , which gives rise to gaussian projection noise  @xcite .",
    "however , as we will discuss in detail , it is the diffraction pattern of the imaging system that gives the form of the collapse in the heisenberg microscope .",
    "imaging systems often involve hard - edged apertures and thus long - tailed ( non - gaussian ) diffraction patterns .",
    "such long - tailed distributions lead in the context of random walks to exotic lvy noise ",
    "so - called `` anomalous diffusion ''  @xcite .",
    "another situation in which one can naturally tailor the form of the collapse would be the detection of resonance fluorescence in the presence of a magnetic field gradient  @xcite . in this case",
    "it is the lorentzian line shape that enters as the collapse function .",
    "thus , in moving towards experiments to realize continuous position measurements via imaging , it is important to understand the impact of long - tailed collapse operators , and under what conditions there may be qualitative modifications to the quantum noise and the conditioned dynamics of the continuously observed atom .",
    "our purpose here is threefold . in sec .",
    "[ sec::2 ] we examine the effect of imaging on the wave - function of a single atom , and show that this can be used to prepare non - classical states , and realize highly nonlinear measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec::3 ] , in preparation for exploring how imaging can be used to generate anomalous diffusion , we examine continuous measurements that contain lvy noise .",
    "we are able to show that there are no truly continuous measurements that are driven only by stable lvy processes  @xcite , with the sole exception being the gaussian .",
    "it turns out that the underlying reason for this is a result that we prove in sec .",
    "[ sec::4 ] : repeated measurements whose errors are given by the stable lvy distributions will eventually collapse the wave - function to a gaussian , just like the usual gaussian measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec::3 ] we also discuss how truly continuous measurements _ can _ contain lvy noise , by combining a stable lvy process with a poisson or gaussian process .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec::4 ] we use the above results to examine how imaging can be designed to make measurements that induce anomalous diffusion , an effect that , in this case , is quantum - mechanical in origin .",
    "we consider the motion of a single two - level atom ( or molecule ) along a single direction , which we will refer to as the @xmath0-axis .",
    "we illuminate the atom with a resonant laser traveling along the @xmath1-axis , and place two lenses or mirrors on opposite sides of the atom that image the emitted photons in the @xmath2-plane .",
    "this configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig::setup ] .",
    "in addition to forming an image of the atom at the detector , the mirrors have a mask over them , which can apply an angle - dependent phase , as well as having an angle - dependent absorption profile .",
    "this mask introduces an aperture for the imaging optics .    to describe the angular dependence of the aperture ,",
    "we use spherical polar coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as usual @xmath3",
    "is the angle to the @xmath0-axis , and @xmath4 is the angle in the @xmath5-plane .",
    "the center of each lens is on the @xmath6-axis , and thus given by @xmath7 .",
    "we parameterize the distance from the center of each lens by @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we will denote the aperture transmission function of the aperture , @xmath9 , and for simplicity we will take this to be independent of @xmath4 in a fixed window @xmath10 ( centered at the center of the lens ) , and to be zero otherwise .",
    "we note that since the aperture may include a phase mask , @xmath11 can be complex .",
    "the basic analysis of the above imaging setup has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the relevant results are as follows . upon detecting a single photon at location @xmath12 on the image , the wavefunction of the atom , @xmath13 , undergoes the transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the required normalization , and the  collapse \" operator @xmath16 is @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the wave number of the emitted photon , and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dipole angular emission function for the photon . by choosing the aperture transmission appropriately",
    ", @xmath21 can be _ any _ function satisfying @xmath22 , with the restriction that @xmath23 is zero outside the aperture capture region .",
    "the fraction @xmath24 of photons captured by the optics is given by the integral of @xmath25 over the capture region .",
    "an emitted photon that is not detected transforms the atomic wave function via the collapse operator @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq::az ] ) , with @xmath21 replaced with @xmath28 . since the photon is not detected , the density matrix of the system is given by averaging over all the possible image locations @xmath29 .",

    "since @xmath30 is zero outside @xmath31 $ ] , for a given @xmath16 we can find the required profile by using the inverse fourier transform : @xmath32 the other key component of imaging is the ability to engineer the mixing of optical modes prior to detection .",
    "we now present three examples that illustrate how these two components can be exploited .    ,",
    "width=384 ]      the imaging configuration described above can be used to prepare an atom in a superposition of two spatially separated states .",
    "this is achieved by chosing the aperture of the imaging system so that the collapse function @xmath16 is the sum of two well - separated gaussians .",
    "let @xmath33 be the variance of both gaussians , and @xmath34 their separation .",
    "an aperture function that does this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::tprof ] .",
    "this aperture covers about @xmath35 of arc in @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath36 $ ] ) , and gives well - separated gaussians with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the wavelength of the emitted photon .",
    "the separation is easily increased by increasing the number of oscillations in the profile .",
    "the fraction of photons captured by the aperture , assuming the two - mirror configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig::setup ] , and @xmath40 , is approximately 1/186 .",
    "the aperture size we have chosen is conservative  using two mirrors with @xmath41 of arc as the focussing elements , capture rates greater than 1 in 20 should be feasible with this aperture profile .",
    "one now prepares the atom in a broad gaussian state , centered at @xmath42 , by cooling it to the ground state of a harmonic trap using standard techniques  @xcite .",
    "one then illuminates the atom with a laser pulse to prepare it in the excited state , and allows it to emit a photon .",
    "this preparation process is repeated until the emitted photon is detected .",
    "( one must repeat the preparation because a single undetected emission destroys the spatial coherence . )",
    "this prepares the atomic wave function in a superposition of two spatially separated wave - packets , with separation @xmath43 and widths @xmath44 .",
    "the relative heights of the two localized wave - packets is determined by the location of the detected photon .",
    "the closer the photon to @xmath42 , the more equal the weighting of the two packets .",
    "naturally one requires that the probability of the smaller packet , @xmath45 , should not be too small .",
    "if the ground state of the trap is broad compared to @xmath43 , a numerical calculation shows that when a photon is detected , the probability that it gives @xmath46 is approximately @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , the superposition can be made arbitrarily symmetric with a sufficient number of repetitions of the preparation process .    ]",
    "measurements of nonlinear observables have applications in state - preparation  @xcite and in detecting signatures of quantum motion , among others .",
    "the usual method of measuring nonlinear observables ( e.g. nonlinear functions of position , @xmath0 ) , is to couple a probe to the system via a nonlinear interaction proportional to the observable .",
    "generating effective nonlinear interactions is not easy , however .",
    "feasible methods exist to generate effective @xmath48 interactions , but generating higher powers becomes increasingly more difficult  @xcite .",
    "we show now that imaging can be used to engineer a measurement of the highly nonlinear function , @xmath49 , without the need for a nonlinear interaction . this measurement can be used to generate spatially separated superposition states , in a similar manner to that of @xmath50 measurements  @xcite , with the advantage that it is linear everywhere but at @xmath42 .",
    "this linearity means that the wave - packets in the resulting superposition will be very nearly gaussian squeezed states .    to realize a measurement of @xmath49 we make the aperture fully transmitting",
    "this allows one , in principle , to capture the majority of emitted photons .",
    "this time we use the optics to first collimate the light .",
    "we then split the light into two beams with a 50 - 50 beam splitter , invert one of them about @xmath42 , and recombine them .",
    "finally we focus the beam to an image , which is now a superposition of the original image and its reflection about @xmath42 .",
    "since we can not now tell @xmath0 from @xmath51 , the detected photon only contains information about @xmath49 .",
    "this measurement can be made quasi - continuous by repeatedly exciting the atom and detecting the emitted photons .",
    "the method can also be extended to more complex measurements , erasing information about multiple intervals of the values of @xmath0 .",
    "all continuous measurements that have been realized to date on quantum systems generate gaussian or poissonian noise . that is , in each infinitesimal time step @xmath52 , the error in the measurement record , and the noise induced in the system , is either the gaussian ( wiener ) increment @xmath53 , with variance @xmath52 , or the discrete jump of a poisson process .",
    "these noise processes are ubiquitous in nature because of the central limit theorem .",
    "there are , however , a whole range of more exotic noise processes that do not have these statistics , and find applications in wide range of phenomena  @xcite . a remarkable class of these are the _ symmetric stable lvy processes _ , @xmath54 , indexed by the continuous parameter @xmath55 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "we will denote the random infinitesimal increment of one of these processes by @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath57 , the lvy process is just the wiener process .",
    "all other stable lvy processes break the central limit theorem because they have infinite variances .",
    "the `` stable '' lvy processes are so - called because the sum of two or more of their increments has the _ same _ probability density as each individual increment ( except that the width of this density is larger by a factor of @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is familiar for gaussian random variables ( the sum of two gaussian deviates is also gaussian ) , but is usually not true for other probability densities .",
    "in fact , if a probability density satisfies the conditions for the central limit theorem , and is not gaussian , then the sum of multiple samples from this density _ must _ differ from the original density , since ultimately this sum must have a gaussian density in the limit of many samples .",
    "when two increments of the ( gaussian ) wiener process are added together , the width ( uncertainty ) of the sum is @xmath59 times that of each increment . as stated above , for the stable lvy process @xmath60 this factor becomes @xmath58 .",
    "this factor determines how the width ( the uncertainty ) of the process scales with time .",
    "the result is that the process @xmath61 has a width proportional to @xmath62 . for gaussian noise",
    "this reduces to the familiar scaling : the standard deviation increases as @xmath63 .",
    "this is the usual behavior of diffusion , for example the diffusion of a pollen grain undergoing brownian motion .",
    "if the uncertainty of a dynamical system scales instead as @xmath62 , for @xmath64 , then this behavior is referred to as _ anomalous diffusion _  @xcite .",

    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] .",
    "a realization , or `` sample path '' , of the cauchy process is quite distinct from the wiener process .",
    "an introduction to lvy processes may be found in  @xcite . with this background out of the way",
    ", we ask how stable lvy processes might be realized by continuous quantum measurements .",
    ", width=384 ]      a continuous measurement of position , @xmath68 , is characterized by the error of the measurement result in an infinitesimal time - interval @xmath52 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath69 is the random variable describing this error , then the increment of the measurement result obtained in the time - interval @xmath52 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant that fixes the overall size of the error .",
    "gaussian measurements have @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "little is yet known as to what classes of exotic lvy processes can appear as the errors in continuous measurements  @xcite .",
    "we now show that continuous measurements can _ never _ have errors given purely by stable lvy processes , with the sole exception being the gaussian .",
    "the amount of information that the measurement obtains about @xmath68 in a short time interval @xmath73 is determined by the width of the probability density of the measurement result in each time interval .",
    "the measurement result is given by dividing @xmath74 by @xmath52 , and is the mean value of the measured quantity plus the random error : @xmath75 the amount of information extracted is determined by the width of the probability density of @xmath76 ; if the error has a large `` variance '' ( width ) the observer gains little information , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , the observers probability density for @xmath68 ( the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the basis of @xmath68 ) after the measurement is given by multiplying her initial probability density by the probability density for @xmath76 , shifted by the measurement result , @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "for a sequence of measurements to produce a valid continuous measurement in the continuum limit , the amount of information extracted ( the change to the observers state - of - knowledge ) must scale in the right way as we reduce the time interval between the measurements , @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the average change to the observer s state - of - knowledge in a fixed time interval , @xmath78 , must remain the same as we reduce the time - step and thus increase the number of measurements in the interval .",
    "for this reason we can show immediately that eq .  ( [ eq::dr ] ) can not describe a continuous measurement if @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "consider first the case when @xmath81 .",
    "because the width of @xmath82 scales as @xmath52 , we see that the width of @xmath83 is _ independent of dt_. since it does not decrease with @xmath52 , as we increase the number of measurements , and take the limit @xmath84 , the amount of information extracted by the observer tends to infinity , resulting in an instantaneous collapse of the wave - function",
    ". this will also be true for @xmath85 .",
    "showing that continuous measurements can not be realized for @xmath86 is not so simple , since in this case the width of the probability density for the error , @xmath87 , diverges as @xmath88 , and thus the extracted information tends to zero as required . to determine whether a continuum limit exists for these measurements we begin by way of a numerical example before we proceed with an analytic calculation .",
    "we start with a state of knowledge for @xmath68 given by a gaussian with unit variance , and simulate a sequence of measurements for @xmath89 .",
    "this involves repeatedly multiplying by the probability density for @xmath60 , which must be obtained from the fourier transform of its characteristic function  @xcite .",
    "we simulate four sequences of measurements , in which each sequence has half the time - step of the one before .",
    "we then examine how the change in the width of the observer s state - of - knowledge scales with the time - step .",
    "we obtain this change by averaging each sequence over four thousand realizations .",
    "the results for the four sequences are displayed on a log - log plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_test ] . from this",
    "we see that the reduction in the observers uncertainty increases as a power of the inverse time - step ( the exponent , or slope in the plot here , is consistent with @xmath90 ) , and thus will reduce the observer s uncertainty to zero in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "a sensible continuum limit would require a flat slope ( flat scaling exponent ) in such a plot as this , as happens in the gaussian case @xmath91 .",
    "again , this means that the amount of information extracted per unit time becomes asymptotically constant as @xmath92 .    ]    to test this for all @xmath93 , we can compute the scaling exponent as a function of @xmath94 . to perform this calculation numerically",
    ", we can use a deterministic method that is more efficient than the monte carlo method of fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_test ] .",
    "the idea is to take a narrow , gaussian initial state , and compute the uncertainty reduction that results from applying the measurement operator centered about a particular measurement result .",
    "we then average the reduction in uncertainty over all measurement results by performing a numerical integral .    the above numerical procedure for calculating the scaling exponent as a function of @xmath94 is rather cumbersome , since there is not a general expression for the measurement operator for arbitrary @xmath94 .",
    "remarkably we can bypass this procedure , and obtain a simple analytic expression for this scaling exponent , using the following insight : if the initial state is gaussian , the application of the measurement function ( lvy density ) _ leaves the final state in a gaussian distribution , and the reduction of the variance behaves , on average , as if the measurement function were itself gaussian_. this is not an obvious statement , and we will justify it in sections [ section : arbproject ] , [ section : gaussian ] , and appendix  [ section : appendix - clt ] .",
    "this result means that the reduction in the variance due to the collapse is simple for every lvy measurement : it is proportional to the inverse square of the width of the distribution for the error ) .",
    "now that we know how the reduction in the variance depends on the width , and we know how the width of the lvy distribution scales with @xmath52 , we can easily determine the scaling of the reduction in the variance . specifically ,",
    "if the measurement error is given by @xmath95 , then the square width of this distribution is @xmath96 .",
    "so the reduction in the variance for a single measurement for duration @xmath52 is @xmath97 .",
    "if we now make @xmath98 measurements , each with duration @xmath99 , then the total reduction is @xmath100 the scaling exponent we seek is therefore @xmath101 .    ) as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "the solid curve is the analytic result ( @xmath101 ) , and the points indicate values obtained by a numerical calculation of the uncertainty reduction due to projection with the corresponding lvy distribution . [",
    "fig : alphascaling ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : alphascaling ] shows the dependence of the power - law scaling exponent ( i.e. , the slope of the line in fig .",
    "[ fig : stable_test ] ) as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "the analytic result @xmath101 is shown along with numerical tests at the specific points indicated .",
    "again , only a scaling exponent of zero can correspond to a sensible continuous limit of a sequence of lvy measurements .",
    "thus we see that , even in the range @xmath102 , the uncertainty decreases _ too quickly _ to correspond to a continuous measurement , as the continuous limit will lead to instantaneous collapse of the state  essentially , corresponding to a divergent measurement strength .",
    "though we have only analyzed a gaussian state , a valid continuous measurement must work for _ every _ state , and thus our analysis is sufficient to rule out these kinds of continuous measurements .",
    "( further , as we will show below , measurements with lvy collapse operators tend to produce gaussian states anyway . )",
    "consequently , only the gaussian ( @xmath91 ) case can correspond to a continuous measurement .",
    "despite the above result , it _ is _ possible to construct continuous measurements that contain the exotic statistics of _ any _ stable lvy process .",
    "to do so we combine the stable process with a poisson process in the following way : we replace the time index upon which the stable process @xmath54 depends with the poisson process @xmath103 , to form the `` chained '' process @xmath104 .",
    "( in the mathematics literature this chaining procedure is referred to as _ subordinating _",
    "@xmath60 with @xmath105 @xcite . )",
    "now examine the behavior of this new lvy process . between jumps of the poission process the time index for the cauchy process",
    "does not change , and thus the increment @xmath106 is zero . upon an event ( a jump ) in the poisson process , the time index of the stable process increases by unity , and thus generates a finite increment @xmath107 .",
    "the temporal scaling of the stable process @xmath60 no longer prevents the process @xmath108 from representing a continuous measurement , since the scaling as @xmath109 is entirely determined by the poisson process .",
    "when there are many jumps in a given time interval , the number of jumps fluctuates only a little from its mean value .",
    "because of this , if we make the rate of jumps @xmath39 large , and set @xmath110 so that the effect of each jump on the measured system is small , then the poisson - subordinated lvy measurement realizes what is effectively a quasi - continuous lvy measurement , with @xmath111 .",
    "our simulations show that the measurement records of these measurements are qualitatively the same as those of the stable lvy processes ( e.g. , fig  [ fig : paths ] ) .",
    "measurements described by the lvy processes @xmath112 can be realized by using the imaging setup of fig .",
    "[ fig::setup ] .",
    "the photodetection events are the jumps of the poisson process , so we need each of these to correspond to a measurement with the result @xmath113 for some @xmath71 .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing the aperture so that the square of the collapse operator is the density @xmath114 , with @xmath71 set by scaling the width of @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "[ fig::tprof]b we give the aperture profile @xmath116 for a cauchy measurement .",
    "this prepares a state with a cauchy probability density for position , and we display the wigner function for this state in fig .  [",
    "fig : wig ] .",
    "so far we have focused on the statistics of the measurement results .",
    "now we turn to the question of generating anomalous diffusion in the _ dynamics _ of a quantum system . in particular , we address the question of what happens to the quantum state under the action of a lvy ( or any other ) spatial projection operator .",
    "we will assume a gaussian initial state , with probability density @xmath117 where for convenience we assume the state is centered at @xmath118 .",
    "as we are interested in the quasi - continuous  and thus weak - measurement  limit , we will assume that the width of the projection operator is much wider than the width of the state .",
    "given a hermitian collapse operator @xmath119 , we have the ( unnormalized ) measurement reduction @xmath120 , or @xmath121 in the position representation .",
    "the operator @xmath122 is very broad , though not necessarily centered at @xmath118 . given that it varies slowly over the extent of the state , we can expand the operator to second order as @xmath123 provided that @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "after dropping normalization factors , the reduced state is @xmath126 where @xmath127 are the new mean and standard deviation , respectively ,    there are several points to note here . for a gaussian collapse operator , for example",
    ", the @xmath128 parameter is _ constant _ , since it is only the @xmath29 parameter that controls the displacement of the gaussian from @xmath118 .",
    "this reiterates the well - known result that a gaussian measurement will reduce the uncertainty of a gaussian state _ deterministically_i.e . , independent of the measurement result .",
    "in particular , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the standard deviation of the measurement function . for any _ other _ form of the collapse operator , a particular measurement may increase or decrease the uncertainty .",
    "it is only on _ average _ that the uncertainty of the state decreases .",
    "again , the @xmath128 parameter , which represents a particular function of the local curvature @xmath131 of the collapse function at @xmath132 , controls how the uncertainty changes due to the collapse .",
    "for example , for a long - tailed distribution such as the cauchy , the uncertainty _ decreases _ if the measurement result is close to zero , but _ increases _ if the measurement result is very far from zero .",
    "also since the @xmath29 parameter controls the displacement of the measurement operator , it likewise controls the shift of the mean of the state in response to the measurement , as we see from @xmath133 .",
    "however , the main point of this section is this : in this regime of broad measurement distributions , the action of the collapse preserves the gaussian form of the quantum state , _ independent _ of the form of the measurement operator .",
    "in particular , even measurements of stable lvy distributions preserve the gaussian form of the quantum state .",
    "now we extend the analysis above and prove a somewhat surprising result :     and @xmath115 are scaled so that @xmath134 = i$ ] , and the width of the cauchy density is @xmath135 .",
    "blue is positive , green negative .",
    "[ fig : wig ] ]    _ theorem : _ in the absence of any hamiltonian evolution , a sequence of many repeated lvy measurements generates a gaussian wave function  independent of the initial state  just as do gaussian measurements .",
    "_ proof : _ a sequence of @xmath98 lvy measurements of @xmath68 corresponds to multiplying the initial position density , @xmath136 , by a sequence of lvy densities .",
    "this means that the characteristic function of the resulting density is the convolution of the characteristic functions of @xmath98 lvy densities .",

    ", @xmath140 is the mean of the lvy density .",
    "if we now think of @xmath142 as a probability density ( for @xmath143 ) , then convolving @xmath98 of them corresponds to adding @xmath98 random variables with density @xmath144 .",
    "since every @xmath142 has a finite second moment , the central limit theorem tells us that for large @xmath98 the result of these convolutions tends to a gaussian .",
    "( note that the usual central limit theorem does not handle complex - valued distributions , so we extend the theorem to cover this case in appendix  [ section : appendix - clt ] . )",
    "if the final characteristic function is gaussian , then the final density is also gaussian .",
    "thus , while a _ single _ lvy measurement on an initially flat density creates a lvy density , many repeated lvy measurements generate gaussian densities , and thus gaussian wave functions .",
    "once the wave - function of a single particle has been reduced to a gaussian , even the exotic measurements discussed above induce only gaussian noise in the dynamics of @xmath68 .",
    "this is not difficult to show analytically for very strong ( small @xmath71 ) and very weak ( large @xmath71 ) measurements , and the numerical simulation we have performed confirm it more generally .",
    "so how does one make measurements that _ do _ generate anomalous diffusion ?",
    "we now show that one can do this using imaging , and in a manner that directly exploits the quantum nature of the measurement back - action .",
    "this distinguishes it from the lvy noise in ref .",

    "@xcite that arise in subrecoil laser cooling ) , which can be treated semiclassically .",
    "after initially preparing the atom in a broad gaussian state , we make a  square \" measurement producing a wave function with a square profile ; that is , a flat wave function with a sharp cut - off at each end .",
