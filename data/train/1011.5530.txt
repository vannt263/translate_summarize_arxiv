    "in the research area of _ ( geometric ) tomography _ one is usually concerned with the reconstruction of an object from information on the projections and/or sections of that object .",
    "discrete tomography is concerned with the reconstruction of discrete objects and relies on discrete tools ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) while analytic tomography is concerned with the reconstruction of objects determined by analytic data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "both research directions are naturally unified within the realm of convex geometry , since convex sets can be of both discrete and analytic nature .",
    "geometric tomography has numerous applications outside mathematics .",
    "e.g. , one of the many links between tomography and physics is the so - called _ phase retrieval problem _ , that is , the problem of retrieving an unknown object from its _ diffraction _ data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the diffraction data can be described in mathematical language as an _ autocorrelation _ or a _",
    "covariogram_.    in this paper we present results on a discrete version of the covariogram problem under convexity assumptions . for presenting the problem",
    "we first start with the ( standard ) covariogram problem in the continuous case .",
    "let @xmath7 .",
    "by @xmath8 we denote the @xmath9-dimensional volume .",
    "let @xmath10 be a _",
    "body _ , i.e. , a bounded set coinciding with the closure of its interior . the ( continuous ) covariogram of @xmath0 is the function @xmath11 that sends @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the covariogram problem is the problem of determining @xmath0 from @xmath2 within a given class of bodies .",
    "clearly , @xmath2 remains unchanged if we translate @xmath0 or reflect @xmath0 with respect to a point ( in what follows , the term ` reflection ' will always mean a point reflection ) .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath0 up to translations and reflections is considered the unique determination .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath2 is the autocorrelation of the characteristic function of @xmath0 . by this",
    ", the covariogram problem is a special case of the phase retrieval problem .",
    "recently there has been much progress on the retrieval of @xmath0 from @xmath2 within the class of convex bodies ( this version of the covariogram problem is usually called _ matheron s problem _ ) ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    if @xmath0 is a finite subset of @xmath1 we define the ( discrete ) covariogram of @xmath0 to be @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; here @xmath16 stands for the cardinality .",
    "the problem of retrieving @xmath0 from @xmath2 is called the discrete covariogram problem . the discrete covariogram problem ( for @xmath17 also known as the _ partial digest problem _ ) was studied by many authors ; see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the discrete covariogram problem is a special case of the continuous covariogram problem .",
    "in fact , for @xmath18 , @xmath2 determines @xmath19^d}$ ] and vice versa .",
    "a subset @xmath0 of @xmath1 is said to be _ lattice - convex _ if @xmath0 is the intersection of @xmath1 with a convex set . by @xmath20",
    "we denote the class of finite , lattice - convex subsets of @xmath1 which affinely span @xmath21 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the problem of determination of @xmath0 from @xmath2 within @xmath20 was first addressed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both papers also give counterexamples to the uniqueness of reconstruction . in our paper",
    "we contribute to the study of this problem . in view of the previous observations , on the one hand ,",
    "this problem is a special case of the continuous covariogram problem and , on the other hand , a discrete version of matheron s problem .",
    "we emphasize that recently the covariogram problem for lattice - convex sets attracted attention of researchers working in _ x - ray crystallography _ and the theory of _ quasicrystals _ ; see  @xcite .",
    "( we refer to @xcite and @xcite for further information on the latter topics . ) the discrete covariogram problem is also related to the _ discrete x - ray problem _",
    "( i.e. , the problem of reconstruction from discrete x - ray pictures ) . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 ) it was proved that sets @xmath22 have equal covariograms if and only if for every direction the discrete x - ray pictures of @xmath0 and @xmath23 are ( so - called ) rearrangements of each other .",
    "strong positive results on the discrete x - ray problem for the class @xmath24 were obtained in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the covariogram problem for @xmath24 and provide both positive and negative results .",
    "one can see that for @xmath25 the directions of the ( discrete ) edges of @xmath0 are determined by @xmath2 .",
    "our positive result ( theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] ) implies that , for a given collection of prescribed edge directions , a set @xmath25 is determined by @xmath2 if all edges of @xmath0 have sufficiently large cardinality and the difference between cardinalities of parallel edges is either zero or sufficiently large .",
    "the proof of the positive result suggests that , under the given sufficient conditions , the retrieval of @xmath0 from @xmath2 is analogous to the retrieval of polygons from the continuous covariogram ( the problem solved in @xcite , see also @xcite for a short solution ) .",
    "thus , the discrete nature of the problem is only revealed when the above sufficient conditions are violated . as examples in (",
    "* section  4 ) and @xcite show , @xmath25 is not always determined by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , as a complement to the positive result , we also study those @xmath25 which are not determined by @xmath2 .",
    "all known @xmath25 not determined by @xmath2 can be represented as a direct sum @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not centrally symmetric and @xmath29 can be covered by two distinct parallel lines .",
    "thus , we are concerned with the characterization of all @xmath0 having the above form .",
    "it turns out that the class of all such @xmath0 is quite narrow ( the convex hull of @xmath30 is a certain polygon with at most six edges and @xmath29 is also of a certain particular form ) ; this is our second main result which is contained in theorem  [ thm : homometry : from : lat : wid : one ] .",
    "the complete classification of all @xmath25 determined by @xmath2 remains an open question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  section  [ sec : main - results ] we introduce necessary notation , present the main results ( theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] and theorem  [ thm : homometry : from : lat : wid : one ] ) , and state consequences and open questions .",

    "the closure of the set @xmath45 is called the _ support _ of @xmath2 and is denoted by @xmath46 . as usual , for @xmath47 the _ ( minkowski ) sum _ @xmath48 is defined to be @xmath49 ; for @xmath50 we also write @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 .",
    "further , we put @xmath53 . the notations @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "are introduced in a similar fashion . for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "we use the notation @xmath58 .    for @xmath10 we put @xmath59:={\\left\\{k+t\\,:\\,t\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^d\\right\\}}\\cup { \\left\\{-k+t\\,:\\,t\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^d\\right\\}}$ ] , which is the set of translations and reflections of @xmath0 .",
    "a pair @xmath60 of subsets of @xmath1 is said to be _ homometric _ if @xmath61 and _ nontrivially homometric _ if additionally @xmath59 \\ne [ l]$ ] .",
    "let us introduce the notion of lattice - convexity with respect to an arbitrary lattice .",
    "a subset @xmath0 of a lattice @xmath62 is said to be _ lattice - convex _ ( with respect to @xmath63 ) if @xmath0 is the intersection of @xmath63 and a convex set .",
    "if @xmath63 is clear from the context , we will drop the qualifier ` with respect to @xmath63 ' . by @xmath64",
    "we denote the class of finite , lattice - convex subsets @xmath0 of @xmath63 with @xmath65 .",
    "we use a few standard notations and definitions of convex geometry ( in some of the cases , carried over to the case of lattice - convex sets ) ; for details see @xcite . if @xmath0 is a subset of @xmath21 , the _ support function _",

    "can be directly carried over to the setting of lattice - convex sets .",
    "if @xmath25 , then a support set @xmath73 with @xmath77 and that contains exactly one element will be called a _ vertex _ of @xmath0 ; a support set @xmath73 with @xmath78 and with more than one element will be called an _",
    "edge _ of @xmath0 with _ outer normal _ @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce @xmath79 vectors @xmath80 with @xmath81 are called _ primitive_.    to measure the number of lattice points on the edges and the difference of parallel edges of @xmath82 we introduce @xmath83 where as usual @xmath84 .",
    "observe that @xmath85 if and only if @xmath0 is centrally symmetric , and that @xmath86 if @xmath0 has no parallel edges of different lengths .    if @xmath87 is a finite set of vectors in @xmath88 which linearly spans @xmath88 , then the _ discrepancy _ @xmath89 of @xmath87 is @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath82 we define @xmath92 .",
    "the geometric meaning of the discrepancy of a system of vectors can be easily visualized in terms of cardinalities of lattice - convex sets . for two primitive vectors",
    "@xmath93 the number @xmath94 is equal to the number of lattice points in the half - open parallelogram @xmath95 ; this can be derived , e.g. , from _ pick s formula_. in this sense , for primitive @xmath12 and @xmath96 , @xmath94 is a measure for ` how densely ' @xmath97 is filled with lattice points , relatively to ` how densely ' the border of this cone is filled .",
    "the discrepancy @xmath89 then can be understood as a number measuring the ` unbalancedness ' of this kind of density of the cones that can be formed by pairs of nonparallel vectors from @xmath87 .",
    "now we are ready to formulate our first main result .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] will be given in section  [ sec : mainproof ] .",

    "most parts of our proof of theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] can be rendered into an algorithmic form .",
    "a detailed analysis of algorithmic issues would certainly be interesting and valuable , but it would go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note that @xmath104 whenever @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the assumption on @xmath100 in theorem  [ thm : main - thm ] can be replaced by the less technical but somewhat stronger assumption @xmath107 .    since examples in @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that @xmath25 is not always reconstructible from @xmath2 , we also study nonreconstructible sets @xmath25 .",
    "that is , we work towards a description of nontrivially homometric pairs of sets lying in @xmath24 .",
    "we first present known information on the related question on the structure of homometric pairs of finite subsets of @xmath1 . in @xcite it is shown that homometry for subsets of @xmath1 can be explained by considering the reconstruction from the autocorrelation within the group ring @xmath108 $ ] , where @xmath109 is @xmath110 , @xmath111 , or @xmath112 .",
    "let us give more details .",
    "let @xmath113 be a sequence of independent commuting indeterminates .",

    "the _ autocorrelation _ of @xmath119",
    "is then defined to be @xmath123 . in (",
    "* theorem  2.3 ) it is shown that @xmath124 $ ] are homometric ( i.e. , have equal autocorrelations ) if and only if @xmath125 and @xmath126 for some @xmath127 , @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 $ ] . ( the proof is based on the fact that @xmath108 $ ] is a unique factorization domain . ) since every finite subset @xmath0 of @xmath1 can be identified with its _ generating function _ @xmath131 and since @xmath132 provides the same information as @xmath2 , the latter result can also be used for homometric pairs of finite subsets of @xmath1 .    as the problem of reconstruction of a finite @xmath18 from @xmath2 is more geometric than the analogous problem for @xmath108",
    "$ ] , one might expect a more geometric reason of homometry .",
    "this is sometimes the case .",
    "the explanation will require the notion of direct ( minkowski ) sums .",
    "we call the minkowski sum @xmath133 of two lattice sets @xmath134 _ direct _ , if for each @xmath135 and @xmath136 the equality @xmath137 implies @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "in this case we write @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the sum of @xmath30 and @xmath29 is direct , then the sum of @xmath30 and @xmath141 is also direct .",
    "one also readily verifies that if @xmath142 satisfy @xmath140 and @xmath143 for suitable @xmath134 , then @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , in this case one has @xmath59\\neq[l]$ ] if and only if both @xmath30 and @xmath29 are not centrally symmetric .",
    "so direct minkowski sums provide a way to construct examples of pairs of nontrivially homometric lattice sets .",
    "we say that the homometric pairs @xmath60 obtained this way are _ geometrically constructible_. for @xmath144 as above the relations @xmath145 and @xmath146 carry over to @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this provides a link to the result for @xmath108 $ ] . in @xcite a homometric pair of subsets of @xmath1 ( for @xmath17 )",
    "was given which is not geometrically constructible .",
    "this justifies the extension from the class of finite subsets of @xmath1 to @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "we wish to study the retrieval of @xmath0 from @xmath2 for @xmath72 .",
