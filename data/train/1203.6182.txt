    "recent work @xcite has highlighted similarities between the turbulence of superfluid helium  ii ( quantum turbulence ) and the turbulence of ordinary ( classical ) fluids . in particular ,",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have established that the distribution of the superfluid kinetic energy over the length scales ( energy spectrum ) obeys the same @xmath0 kolmogorov scaling of ordinary turbulence @xcite where @xmath1 is the wavenumber .",
    "the similarity is remarkable because helium  ii is unlike an ordinary fluid : firstly , it has a two - fluid nature , consisting of a viscous normal fluid component and an inviscid superfluid component coupled by a mutual friction @xcite ; secondly , superfluid vorticity is not a continuous field ( like in an ordinary fluid ) but is restricted to discrete vortex filaments around which the circulation is fixed to the ratio of planck s constant and the mass of one helium atom .    in most experiments turbulence in helium  ii",
    "is excited mechanically ( by stirring the helium with grids or propellers @xcite or forcing it along pipes @xcite ) , or thermally ( by the application of a heat flux @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest , most studied form of thermal stirring ( to which hereafter we restrict our work ) is called thermal counterflow .",
    "the name arises because the normal fluid and the superfluid move in opposite directions , so that their velocity difference is proportional to the applied heat flux and the net mass flux is zero .",
    "other forms of heat transfer ( e.g. pure superflow ) and other techniques to generate turbulence ( e.g. ultrasound @xcite , ion injection and spin - downs @xcite ) are either less studied , or refer to the low temperature limit ( below @xmath2 ) , or have a special character ( rotating turbulence , turbulent fronts , the kibble - zurek mechanism , etc . ) .",
    "thus they are not our interest here , and nor are the special methods used to model them ; for these aspects we refer the reader to a recent review @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to clarify the difference between thermally - excited counterflow turbulence and mechanically - excited turbulence in helium  ii . for simplicity",
    ", we are concerned only with statistical steady state turbulence away from boundaries ( thus ignoring the important problems of turbulence decay and flow profiles ) , and at the relatively high temperatures , where mutual friction plays a role .    after setting up the necessary numerical models ( section  [ section:2 ] ) we compute for the first time the energy spectrum of counterflow turbulence ,",
    "compare it to the spectrum of mechanically - driven turbulence , and test the idea which has been proposed in the literature that `` counterflow turbulence has only one length scale '' , meaning the average intervortex distance ( section  [ section:3 ] ) .",
    "we also find that thermally- and mechanically - induced turbulence differ with respect to curvature ( section  [ section:4 ] ) , the presence of coherent structures ( section  [ section:5 ] ) and vortex reconnection statistics .",
    "the last result suggests a method to detect experimentally the existence of superfluid vortex bundles ( section  [ section:6 ] ) .",
    "section  [ section:7 ] summarises the conclusions .",
    "following schwarz @xcite , we model quantum vortex filaments as space curves @xmath3 which move according to    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is time , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are temperature dependent friction coefficients @xcite , @xmath8 is the unit tangent vector at the point @xmath9 , @xmath10 is arc length , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are externally applied normal fluid and superfluid velocities .",
    "the self - induced velocity of the vortex filament at the point @xmath9 is given by the biot - savart law @xcite @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the quantum of circulation and the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration @xmath15 .",
    "the total superfluid velocity is thus @xmath16 .    in the case of thermal counterflow ( which hereafter we simply refer to as thermally - driven , to contrast it to mechanically - driven turbulence ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 arise from the imposed heat flux @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the counterflow velocity , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the specific entropy , @xmath22 is the temperature , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the superfluid and normal fluid densities , and @xmath25 .",
    "we make the usual @xcite simplifying assumption of uniform velocity profiles @xmath11 and @xmath12 away from boundaries , neglecting the possibility that at sufficiently large @xmath26 the normal fluid becomes turbulent @xcite .",
    "it is also convenient to perform the calculation in the frame of reference of the imposed superflow , setting @xmath27 .    in the case of mechanically - induced turbulence , since we ignore boundaries and flow profiles , we set @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schwarz ] ) and replace @xmath11 with the following synthetic turbulent flow @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are wave vectors and angular frequencies .",
    "this @xmath11 is solenoidal , time - dependent , and , with a suitable choice of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( adapted to the periodic box @xcite ) , its energy spectrum has kolmogorov form @xmath35 in the range from @xmath36 ( corresponding to the integral scale ) to @xmath37 ( corresponding to the dissipation scale ) .",
    "synthetic turbulence is widely used to study transport properties , and compares very well with direct numerical simulations and experiments ( for example it satisfies observed two - points turbulence statistics ) .",
    "our calculations are performed in a periodic cube of size @xmath38 . the numerical techniques to discretize the vortex filaments into a variable number of points @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) held at minimum separation @xmath41 ,",
    "compute the time evolution , de - singularize the biot - savart integrals , evaluate @xmath42 using a tree - method ( with critical opening angle @xmath43 ) , and algorithmically perform vortex reconnections when vortex lines come sufficiently close to each other , are all described in our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that our models have a limitation : the normal fluid is prescribed rather than computed self - consistently .",
    "the inclusion of the back - reaction of the superfluid vortices onto the normal fluid would require the numerical solution of the navier - stokes equation for the normal fluid ( suitably modified by the inclusion of a mutual friction term ) , alongside the time evolution of the superfluid vortices .",
    "however , a dynamically self - consistent model would be very complex and computationally expensive , and one could not easily explore parameter space and the effects of changing numerical resolution and initial conditions .",
    "this approach was attempted for a single vortex ring @xcite . in the case of turbulence , this approach has so far been limited to the initial growth of a cloud of vortex lines @xcite .",
    "we choose temperature @xmath44 ( at which @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) which is typical of experiments and allows direct comparison with previous work , and numerical resolution @xmath47 .",
    "first we calculate thermally - induced turbulent vortex tangles at increasing values of @xmath48 .",
    "we find that , after an initial transient , the vortex line density @xmath49 ( vortex length per unit volume ) saturates to a statistically steady state ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) of density @xmath50 which is independent of the details of the initial condition (",
    "various vortex loops configurations were tried ) .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( top ) shows a snapshot of such vortex tangle .",
    "our vortex line densities agree with previous work ; for example , taking @xmath44 we obtain @xmath51 which compares well to @xmath52 and @xmath53 obtained in the numerical simulations of adachi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and in the experiments of childers and tough  @xcite respectively .    to analyze our results we fourier - transform the superfluid velocity and compute the energy spectrum @xmath54 .",
    "if the turbulence is isotropic , @xmath54 is defined by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is volume , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the three - dimensional wavenumber .",
    "however , it is well known @xcite that counterflow turbulence is flattened on the ( @xmath59 ) plane perpendicular to the direction ( @xmath60 ) of the heat flux .",
    "for example , if @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the vortex lengths ( per unit volume ) projected in the @xmath60 , @xmath64 and @xmath65-direction , at @xmath66 we have @xmath67 .",
    "it is therefore better to distinguish between parallel and perpendicular superfluid energy spectra , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , calculated replacing @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ek ] ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . fig",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] ( top ) shows @xmath69 for various @xmath48 plotted in the range @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the perpendicular wavevector ) ; the vertical lines mark the wavenumbers @xmath75 corresponding to the average intervortex spacing , @xmath76 .",
    "it is apparent that the perpendicular energy spectrum @xmath69 has a broad peak in the mesoscales at intermediate wavenumbers @xmath77 . at larger @xmath1",
    "the spectrum follows the typical @xmath78 scaling of smooth isolated vortex lines as expected .",
    "the parallel spectrum @xmath68 vs @xmath79 ( where @xmath79 is the parallel wavevector ) exhibits similar features , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "plotting @xmath69 and @xmath68 vs @xmath1 rather than @xmath74 and @xmath79 yields similar results .",
    "we note that the counterflow energy spectrum , which we measure , is qualitatevely similar to the spectrum shown by nemirovskii , tsubota and araki @xcite in their fig.2 .",
    "proceeding in analogy to what we did for counterflow turbulence , we start from an arbitrary seeding initial condition , drive the vortex tangle with the synthetic turbulent flow of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) , and let @xmath49 grow and saturate to a statistical steady state of turbulence which does not depend on the initial condition ( the time behaviour of @xmath49 is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . a snapshot of this mechanically - driven tangle is shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "we then compute the superfluid energy spectrum . in agreement with previous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work ,",
    "we find that the energy is concentrated at the largest scales , @xmath80 , and that @xmath81 for large @xmath1 ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that there is a remarkable spectral difference between thermally - driven turbulence and mechanically - driven turbulence . whereas in the former",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy is concentrated at intermediate length scales , in the latter most of the energy is at the largest scales , as in classical ordinary turbulence .",
    "an argument is often made in the literature that counterflow turbulence has only one characteristic length scale , the intervortex distance @xmath82 : it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] that @xmath54 does not have a sharp peak at @xmath83 ( indicated by the vertical lines ) , but rather a broad maximum at smaller wavenumbers in the mesoscale region @xmath84 . the traditional argument ,",
    "although quantitatively wrong , is thus qualitatively correct .",
    "if we look carefully at the vortex tangles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we notice that the thermally - driven tangle ( top ) contains relatively more closed loops , and the mechanically - driven tangle ( bottom ) contains relatively more long vortices which extend throughout the periodic computational domain .",
    "we sample the curvature @xmath85 along each vortex loop and construct the probability density function ( pdf ) of the mean curvature @xmath86 of each distinct loop . fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the result .",
    "we notice that mechanically - driven turbulence contains smaller curvatures ( that is , larger radii of curvature @xmath87 ) than thermally - driven turbulence ; indeed , for the latter @xmath88 has a maximum at @xmath89 in correspondence of the maximum of the energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    as an additional numerical experiment",
    ", we compute the energy spectra of configurations of circular vortex rings placed randomly in the periodic box of size @xmath90 as a function of the rings radius @xmath91 .",
    "we find that if @xmath92 ( in which case rings are `` folded '' into broken arches by the periodic boundary conditions ) most of the energy is concentrated at the largest length scales , whereas if @xmath93 the energy spectrum peaks at intermediate scales , in analogy with the counterflow spectrum .",
    "we also notice another difference between the two forms of turbulence .",
    "if we convolve the vortex filaments with a gaussian kernel and define a smoothed vorticity field @xmath94 ( the details of the procedure are described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it becomes apparent - see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] - that the thermally - induced tangle ( sustained by the uniform @xmath11 ) is essentially featureless , whereas the mechanically - induced tangle ( sustained by the turbulent @xmath11 ) contains `` vortical worms '' , or regions of concentrated vorticity - see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "this result is consistent with the observation of `` worms '' in two other related turbulent flows : ordinary viscous turbulence @xcite and pure superfluid turbulence at @xmath95 without the normal fluid @xcite ; both flows satisfy the kolmogorov @xmath0 scaling .",
    "it is known from previous work that if intense regions of normal fluid vorticity are imposed , such as gaussian vortex tubes @xcite , abc flows @xcite or worms @xcite , these structures will induce ( via the friction force ) similar structures in the superfluid vortex lines . our synthetic turbulent flow @xmath11 , although not completely featureless on its own , contains only weak vortex structures , much smaller @xcite than the vortical worms arising from direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "therefore the observation of superfluid vortex bundles driven by the synthetic turbulent flow @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks ] ) must be an underestimate of the strength of these bundles .",
    "if we solved the navier - stokes equation for the normal fluid ( rather than imposing @xmath11 ) , the normal fluid s worms would probably `` imprint '' vortex bundles in the superfluid , besides the bundles which arise naturally in the superfluid as a consequence of euler dynamics @xcite .",
    "a tentative explanation of the observation that the vortex configuration is rather homogeneous for thermally - driven turbulence and inhomogeneous for mechanically - driven turbulence is that in the former ( assuming , as we do , a uniform normal flow ) the growth rate of the donnelly - glaberson ( dg ) instability ( which transforms normal fluid s energy into superfluid vortex length ) is the same everywhere , whereas in the latter it changes with time and space .",
    "the dg mechanism is the following @xcite .",
    "if it is large enough , the component @xmath56 of the normal fluid velocity along a vortex lines can destabilise a ( helical ) kelvin wave of given wavenumber @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the kelvin wave grows with amplitude @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the initial amplitude of the helix and @xmath98 is the growth rate , @xmath99 , and @xmath100}$ ] .",
    "the growth of the kelvin wave , however , may be interrupted by a vortex reconnection which  breaks \" the vortex line .",
    "it is known that vortex reconnections play an essential role in the turbulence @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is prudent to assess the effect of reconnections on the dg instability .",
    "consider mechanically - driven turbulence in a statisticaly steady state at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) driven by the rms normal fluid velocity @xmath101 , with average vortex length @xmath102 , vortex line density @xmath103 , and intervortex spacing @xmath104 , and thermally - driven turbulence at the same temperature with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the average number @xmath109 of vortex reconnections per unit time is monitored during the numerical calculations ; we obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 for mechanically and thermally driven turbulence , respectively ( in reasonable agreement with the estimate @xmath112 , for a homogeneous isotropic tangle , of barenghi & samuels @xcite ) .    the mode which undergoes the most rapid dg instability has wavenumber @xmath113 and growth rate @xmath114 , corresponding to the length scale @xmath115 . in",
    "both mechanically - driven and thermally - driven cases this length scale ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively ) is larger than than the average distance between vortices @xmath82 , and so not suitable for our analysis .",
    "we therefore perform an analysis for kelvin waves with a wavelength and a wavenumber equal to @xmath82 and @xmath118 , respectively ; we assume that such waves are the lowest frequency waves in our system .",
    "the growth rate of such a waves is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg_sigma ] ) .",
    "the reconnection rate @xmath109 computed during the simulations is a statistical property of the vortex tangle as a whole .",
    "however we can compute a reconnection frequency for a wavenumber and wave amplitude by scaling the total reconnection rate by the fraction of the total vortex length that a given wavelength takes .",
    "in such a manner we define @xmath121^{-1/2}dx.\\ ] ] fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] shows the ratio @xmath122 vs wave amplitude @xmath123 for the two simulations described above .",
    "we note a large contrast in the behaviour of the ratio of these two timescales when comparing the mechanically and thermally driven cases .",
    "for the latter one would estimate that the amplitude of perturbations along the vortices can grow to approximately the intervortex spacing before reconnections dominate the behaviour of the tangle .",
    "however , in the mechanically driven case @xmath124 for @xmath125 so that the large amplitude perturbations are able to grow , before reconnections randomise the tangle and introduce topological changes .",
    "therefore the difference in the balance between these two competing timescales is likely to be partially responsible for the differences in the nature of the two turbulent systems .",
    "the existence of superfluid vortex bundles @xcite , their dynamics @xcite and their particular significance at very low temperatures @xcite have been discussed in the literature , but so far there is no clear experimental evidence for them .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of bundles of locally almost parallel vortices ( which we have demonstrated in the previous section for mechanically - induced turbulence ) leads to a suppression of vortex reconnections @xcite .    in the vortex filament model , vortex reconnections",
    "are performed algorithmically ; the details are described in ref .  @xcite . within the approximation , intrinsic to the model , it is instructive to study the distribution of the angles @xmath126 between reconnecting vortex lines at the level of discretization which we use ( which is necessarily much larger than @xmath127 ) .",
    "the normalised distribution of values of @xmath126 , @xmath128 , is shown in fig .  [ fig:9 ] : the solid black line with black circles refers to mechanically - driven turbulence , and the solid red line with red squares to thermally driven turbulence .",
    "it is apparent that in thermally - induced turbulence the majority of vortex reconnections take place between vortex filaments which are nearly anti - parallel ( @xmath129 ) , whereas in mechanically - driven turbulence most reconnections are between vortices which are nearly parallel ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "our results confirm that indeed the presence of organised bundles of vortices changes the typical geometry of reconnections .",
    "to check the temperature dependence of the results we repeat our calculations at higher temperature , @xmath131 . at this temperature",
    "the friction coefficients are larger ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) , therefore a more intense vortex tangle is generated at the same value of the drive ; moreover , short kelvin waves are damped out more quickly .",
    "we check that at the higher temperature @xmath131 the same differences between thermally - driven and mechanically - driven turbulence are present , which we have described in the previous sections for @xmath44 in terms of energy spectrum , curvature and coherence structures .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows that , qualitatively , the distribution of reconnecting angles is also temperature independent ( the black solid line , which refers to mechanically - driven turbulence peaks at small @xmath126 , the solid red line which refers to thermally - driven turbulence peaks at large @xmath126 ) .",
    "this result could be exploited to look for experimental evidence of superfluid vortex bundles in the following way . using solid hydrogen tracer particles to visualise the vortex lines , paoletti , fisher and lathrop _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined that the the minimum distance @xmath134 between vortex lines before and after a reconnection scales as    @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the time at which the reconnection takes place , with fitting coefficients @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we proceed in this way , monitoring vortex reconnections in our numerical calculations .",
    "[ fig:10 ] shows the probability density functions of our fitting parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 obtained for 1107 reconnections in thermally - driven turbulence ( average values @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) and 879 reconnections in mechanically - driven turbulence ( average values @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) .",
    "our fitting coefficients thus agree fairly well with the experimental findings of ref . @xcite and with the numerical results of tsubota and adachi @xcite ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) .",
    "[ fig:10 ] shows that the distribution of values of @xmath139 is different for thermally - driven and mechanically - driven turbulence .",
    "the effect must arise from the different distributions of curvature and reconnecting angles @xmath126 for vortex bundles , which are present only in mechanically - driven turbulence .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] , which displays scatter plots of the fitting parameters @xmath139 ( top ) and @xmath140 ( middle ) .",
    "[ fig:11 ] also shows the angular dependence of the mean curvature @xmath147 ( bottom ) of the reconnecting vortex segments .",
    "it is clear that the curvature of the filaments after a reconnection is dependent on the angle of the reconnection . from inspection of the local induction approximation",
    "@xcite we would expect larger velocities ( and thus @xmath139 ) with increased curvature , as we observe in the numerical simulations .",
    "these result suggests a possible experimental strategy to establish the existence of vortex bundles based on the careful analysis of the reconnection fitting parameter @xmath139 .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed for the first time the question of the energy spectrum of thermally - induced counterflow turbulence , and found that it is unlike the spectrum of turbulence generated mechanically .",
    "more in general , we have found that the two forms of quantum turbulence which can be generated in superfluid helium are quite different .",
    "counterflow turbulence , driven thermally by a constant normal fluid velocity , is uniform in physical space and the energy spectrum is concentrated at intermediate wavenumbers @xmath1 . on the contrary , quantum turbulence driven mechanically by a turbulent normal",
    "fluid contains regions of concentrated coherent vorticity and vortex lines with larger radii of curvature ; the energy is concentrated at the largest scales , exhibiting the same @xmath0 scaling of ordinary turbulence which suggests the presence of an energy cascade .",
    "our results prove that counterflow turbulence , a form of disordered heat transfer unique to liquid helium , lacks the multitude of interacting length scales which is perhaps the main property of ordinary turbulence .",
    "vortex reconnections are affected by the presence of bundles of almost parallel vortices , suggesting an experimental technique to detect these bundles based on monitoring the vortex separation after reconnections .",
