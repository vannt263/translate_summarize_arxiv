    "although solving einstein equations for a classical charged black hole ( bh ) ( reissner - nordstrm one ) is a relatively simple task @xcite , such an approach does not make evident the relationship between its two parameters , namely its mass ( @xmath8 ) and charge ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "intuitively , this relation must exists since electromagnetic energies have their origin in charges , and it can be found in a variety of ways . an interesting , notably physical manner , was put forward by christodoulou @xcite and christodoulou and ruffini @xcite , by introducing the concept of bh reversible transformations @xcite .",
    "such transformations are the only ones that could bring back the bh parameters to their original values after any transformation processed by a test particle with parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "another known approach was due to bardeen , carter and hawking @xcite , which takes advantage of the spacetime symmetries .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite , in the context of spherically symmetric spacetimes , that reversible transformations are fully equivalent to the constancy of the event horizon upon such changes for any nonlinear theory of the electromagnetism @xmath13 that leads to asymptotically flat solutions . due to the generality of the analysis ,",
    "such a constant must be @xmath14 , where @xmath4 is the irreducible bh mass given by the total mass - energy of the system in the uncharged case , namely when @xmath15 . due to this fact",
    ", @xmath4 must be always positive .",
    "the aforementioned equivalence allows us to exchange the problem of solving nonlinear differential equations for nonlinear theories by the problem of solving algebraic equations .",
    "this procedure works only for the cases where event horizons are present .",
    "we recall that after the seminal work of bekenstein @xcite , it is known that the entropy of a black hole is equivalent to its @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , it is more appealing to our reasoning to make use of the original concept of irreducible mass , @xmath4 .    the aim of this work is to elaborate on the consequences of the mass - energy decomposition for nonlinear bhs and their interactions . in order to do it",
    ", we use the specific nonlinear theory of electromagnetism due to born & infeld ( bi ) @xcite .",
    "such a theory has regained interest due to its analogous emergence as an effective theory to string theory @xcite .",
    "it was constructed with the purpose of remedying the singular behavior in terms of energy of a pointlike charged particle .",
    "the theory introduces a parameter @xmath2 , identified with the absolute upper limit of the electric field of a system when just electric aspects are present .",
    "born and infeld fixed this parameter by imposing that in the minkowski spacetime the associated electromagnetic energy coming from a point - like electron equals its rest mass ( unitarian viewpoint @xcite ) . nevertheless , the dualistic viewpoint @xcite could equally well have been assumed and the parameter @xmath2 should be determined by a theory relying on it , such as quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "actually , the bi theory has been applied to the description of the hydrogen atom , both non - relativistic and relativistic one @xcite , and their numerical analyses show that @xmath2 must be much larger than the value initially proposed by bi .",
    "notwithstanding , a definite value has not been obtained .",
    "rasheed @xcite has analyzed mathematically the validity of the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics and concluded that they do hold for any nonlinear lagrangian of the electromagnetism .",
    "although rasheed concluded that the black hole mass formula for such a case does not keep the same simple functional form as for the maxwellian lagrangian , a further scrutiny of the consequences of this fact was not performed .",
    "following our results in ref .",
    "@xcite , we instead shall analyze in this work some consequences of the black hole mass formula in the case of einstein - born - infeld black holes , and their interactions .",
    "since such a relation establishes a constraint for the parameters of the theory , physically based on conservation laws , the description is expected to be greatly simplified , as it will turn out to be exactly the case . to the best of our knowledge , this has not been done before .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section , the mathematical approach for reversible transformations",
    "is briefly elaborated and the mass decomposition for @xmath13 theories in the spherically symmetric case is exhibited . in section [ bi lag ] , we revisit some aspects of the einstein - born - infeld black hole solution and exhibit the black hole mass decomposition for this theory . in section [",
    "clothed ] , we analyze some properties of the above mentioned mass decomposition and show that when @xmath2 is finite , there are always intrinsic nonclassical islands of black hole solutions where each member has a single , nondegenerated horizon .",
    "section [ hawking ] is devoted to the study of the consequences of assuming that einstein - born - infeld black holes evaporate within the framework of the mass decomposition . in section [ grr ]",
    "we analyze the radiation emitted by two interacting einstein - born - infeld black holes and show by means of a toy model that in principle there are alternative ways to infer the constant @xmath2 even from astrophysical scenarios .",

    "let us choose , as it is reasonable under the point of view of black hole interactions coming from neutron stars , @xmath153 cm , where @xmath154 is the mass of the sun .",
    "let us focus our attention at a given value of @xmath5 such that the associated radiated energy may differ considerably from its classical counterpart . as a simple inspection in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] reveals , one could take as a good example for so @xmath155 , where the energy radiated off by born - infeld black holes is around @xmath156 more than maxwellian ones with identical parameters .",
    "besides we recall that we have already chosen @xmath157 for plotting fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from this case , we have @xmath158 [ see eq .",
    "( [ born_mass ] ) ] , which shows that @xmath159 is a perfectly good candidate for the case @xmath90 , the one we are interested here . for this case",
    "we know that @xmath160@xmath161c and finally @xmath162@xmath163 , which is about a thousand times larger than @xmath140 and hence in agreement with the bound given by the hydrogen atom , the only remaining physical constraint .",
    "therefore , the above example suggests that the radiation coming from coalescing astrophysical black holes could be a good tool to access and discriminate their electrodynamical properties .",
    "foremost , it is clear that the approach of analyzing a given black hole solution just from its metric and the one from its metric and energy decomposition expression must be consistent since both approaches use intrinsic properties of the spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , the latter approach is much more restrictive than the former one .",
    "it must be stressed that the energy decomposition ( black hole thermodynamics ) is mandatory for the proper description of any ( clothed ) black hole phenomenon , since it is in accord with conservation laws .",
    "such a constraint equation ( energy decomposition ) in turn automatically evidences the physically relevant cases in black hole physics , hence leading to a pellucid description of them .",
    "the energy decomposition analysis within einstein - born - infeld black holes leads us to their split into two fundamental families of black holes .",
    "whenever @xmath90 , independent of their irreducible masses , one is led to an associated black hole whose singularity can not be forestalled after test particles cross its sole , non degenerated horizon . besides , the previous inequality naturally leads to an absolute upper limit to the charge of approximately @xmath164 cm @xmath165 @xmath166c , given that @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "finally , we notice that for this class of black holes , the extractable energy could be up to one hundred percent , since black holes with @xmath90 could even have @xmath79 .",
    "we stress that the previous conclusions are strictly nonclassical consequences of the finiteness of @xmath2 .",
    "the second family of black holes is defined by those satisfying @xmath77 , where @xmath168 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ mirredc ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) ] for each black hole associated .",
    "it constitutes the family that generalizes einstein - reissner - nordstrm black holes for irreducible masses smaller than transitional values , the nontrivial solutions of @xmath169 , and larger than @xmath122 ( related to their minimum energies ) , whose associated energies ( masses ) are always smaller than @xmath76 . above such transitional irreducible masses ,",
    "again due to the finiteness of @xmath2 , nonclassical black holes with single horizons also rise , all of them having masses larger than @xmath76 .",
    "the total amount of energy that could be extracted [ @xmath41 , see eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) ] in this case is always inferior to half of the total energy of the hole ( as it occurs for reissner - nordstrm black holes , see @xcite ) , here due to the self - interactions present .",
    "black holes satisfying @xmath77 should radiate off ( suppose by emitting uncharged scalar particles ) until their temperatures reach @xmath109 , taking for doing so an infinite amount of time , settling down exactly at their lowest energy state , as one would intuitively expect and here as a direct consequence of the mass formula",
    ". further energy could be extracted from them ( obviously by means of other processes rather than the emission of uncharged scalar particles ) even when @xmath109 , since they still have an ergosphere . for the case",
    "@xmath90 , it is impossible to have @xmath109 and they are expected to keep radiating , with a much more complex dynamics , until their total evaporation likely after a finite amount of time as measured by the observer who receives the radiation . whenever charged scalar fields are taken into account , the phenomenon of superradiance could also take place , rendering their dynamics even more cumbersome .",
    "superradiance is of interest for charged nonlinear black holes , since it is another energy extraction mechanism for them and would couple to the nonlinearities of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we let more precise analyses of this case to be done elsewhere .    concerning the issue of energies radiated off due to the interaction of black holes , as we showed here with a toy model , the changes imprinted by the einstein - born - infeld black holes w.r.t .",
    "their classical counterparts may be significant , depending on @xmath144 for a range of values of the fundamental parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this could be important for gravitational wave detectors calibrated based on classical results .",
    "besides , if it is possible to identify sources of radiation , then measurements upon such a quantity could give us information about electromagnetic interactions .",
    "we analyzed the radiated energies due to charged black hole interactions .",
    "this means that also electromagnetic radiation is always present in such processes .",
    "identifying and analyzing this part of the radiation would gives direct information about astrophysical electrodynamical processes .",
    "we further point out that all the above conclusions remain valid even in the case the systems present a slow rotation ( when the rotational parameter @xmath170 , @xmath171 being the total angular momentum of the system as seen by distant observers , is much smaller than the outer horizon area or the mass of the hole ) .",
    "this is the case since the energy decomposition must be an even power of @xmath172 , due to invariance requirements .",
    "thereby , the previous analyses are in a sense stable against rotational perturbations .    summing up",
    ", in this work we tried to emphasize the need of also taking into account the mass decomposition of a charged black hole for talking about the physical aspects it could display . conceptually speaking",
    "this is of relevance since it could give us acumen of where and how to search experimentally for charged black holes and their interactions . in this regard , it would be also of interest to investigate the aspects of the electromagnetic radiation coming from the coalescence of charged black holes , because it could be much more easily observed , it would give us direct information about electromagnetic phenomena and of the coalescence process itself .",
    "it also seems that qpos could also shed a light on the illation of black hole charges and the role played by the nonlinearities of the electromagnetism in the astrophysical scope , since they talk about phenomena that take place in the innermost regions of black holes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
