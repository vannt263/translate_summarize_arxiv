    "the propulsive motion of artificial and biological micron - scale objects is an interesting problem at low reynolds hydrodynamics . in this condition",
    "the dynamics is dominated by viscous forces .",
    "examples of these micron scale objects include biological microorganisms like bacteria and also man - made micro - swimmers , useful to operate at microfluidic investigations @xcite .",
    "propulsive motion at low reynold s number is subject to the _ scallop theorem _ @xcite . at small scales , where , the reynolds number is very low , the governing hydrodynamic equations , i.e. the stokes and continuity equations are linear and invariant under time reversal @xcite .",
    "any reciprocal shape deformation retraces its trajectory and the system stay back at the point where it started .",
    "in order to achieve a net translational displacement , the system should perform the body deformations in a non - reciprocal manner .",
    "as mentioned by purcell a low - reynolds propeller must have at least two internal degrees of freedom and he proposed a three - link swimmer .",
    "the detailed motion of purcell s swimmer was examined by h. stone where , it was shown that purcell s system could swim and its dynamical properties were calculated @xcite . inspired by purcell s system , a low reynolds swimmer constructed by three linked spheres was introduced and analyzed by najafi",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and experimentally realized by m. leoni _",
    "after purcell s proposal there have been considerable scientific efforts in designing artificial swimmers .",
    "such swimmers would be useful in developing microfluidic experiments .",
    "furthermore , progresses in assembling micro - swimmers show the possibility of using micro - machines inside the biological cells for non invasive therapeutic treatments @xcite . on the other hand , there are many theoretical works devoted to the study of different aspects in the motion of biological microorganisms at low reynolds number condition @xcite .",
    "such interests include sperm swimming , metachronal waves in cilia , e - coli chemotaxis and coupling mediated by hydrodynamic interaction between nearby microorganisms @xcite . for a review of recent progress on low reynolds hydrodynamics of microorganisms ,",
    "see for example the review article by e. lauga @xcite .",
    "our first aim in this article is to present a simplified model that captures the characteristics of a swimming biological organism like a bacterium .",
    "dipolar far velocity field and asymmetric shape , corresponding to the head - tail geometry of the organisms are two important features of micro swimmers .",
    "we model these systems by considering two spheres with different radii that are changing their separation .",
    "we will study the translational and angular motion of this system .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the schematic geometry of a model swimmer composed of two spheres .",
    "as shown in this figure two small and large spheres with radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected by two perpendicular and negligible diameter rods .",
    "let denote the lengths of long and short rods by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the connection is established in a way that the angle between two rods is fixed to @xmath4 while the relative angular position of small rod with respect to the large sphere can be varied .",
    "additionally , we assume that the length of the long rod can be dynamically changed . in this case , the system will have two internal degrees of freedom , the length of the long rod @xmath5 and the rotational angle of the short rod @xmath6 .",
    "the geometry which we are introducing here resembles the body shape of a bacterium with a single flagellum or cilium .",
    "bacteria use beating patterns in their tails to move . the small sphere in our two - sphere model acts as a beating tail and the large sphere resembles the head of animal .",
    "the minimum condition for swimming at low reynolds number can be achieved in our three - dimensional model . by changing the length of long rod and the angle of small one in a prescribed form",
    "we are able to choose the motion which breaks the time - reversal symmetry , the necessary condition for translational motion and consequently propel the system .     and @xmath7 .",
    "]    as an example for the internal motion of the system , we let the angle @xmath6 increase with constant angular velocity and the length of long rod change periodically around an average length .",
    "the explicit form of this motion is given by : @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "in this case , the position vector of the small sphere , seen in the reference frame that is co - moving with the large sphere , is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the length of the small rod and @xmath11 represent the average length of the long rod .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a typical real space trajectory of the small sphere that is seen in the reference frame co - moving with the large sphere .",
    "different choices for @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to different forms of the internal motion . for @xmath14 with @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 as two positive integer numbers , we see that the paths in the @xmath17-space are closed loops . one should note that the phase space of internal motion ( @xmath17-space ) is the surface of a cylinder .",
    "the axial direction on the cylinder represents the @xmath18-direction and the azimuthal angle is shown by the transverse direction on the cylinder .",
    "for @xmath19 , the phase space trajectory is a closed curve which traces exactly one complete turn round the cylinder while for @xmath20 the trajectory is a closed loop that turns many times round the cylinder . in both cases , the geometry of the closed curves in the cylindrical - shape phase space are examples of nonreciprocal motions that can generate a net translational motion .",
    "at zero reynold s number the stokes equations govern the dynamics of fluid . the solution of the stokes equation for a point force singularity is formulated in terms of green s function and is called stokeslet . for a point force singularity with strength @xmath21 located at point @xmath22 ,",
    "the velocity field generated in the fluid is given by : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "oseen has derived the explicit form of the green s function @xmath25 for an infinite flow that is bounded internally by a solid sphere with radius @xmath1 @xcite . for the explicit form of this solution",
    ", we refer to the original article by oseen .",
    "as it is manifested by oseen s solution , the flow field due to a point force in the presence of a solid sphere can be regarded as the flow of the original point force and the flow due to the singular parts that are located at an image position inside the sphere .",
    "the location of the image point inside the sphere is given by its position vector , @xmath26 , relative to the sphere s center .",
    "as argued by higdon the total force acting by a point force on fluid bounded by a no - slip sphere is equivalent to the total stokeslet strength @xcite .",
    "total stokeslet strength includes the image point force inside the sphere . for a point force @xmath21 ,",
    "the image point force is defined by : @xmath27 where the radial and tangential components of this image force are given by : @xmath28 . here",
    "two coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by : @xmath31 in the next section we will use these results for analyzing the motion of two - sphere system .",
    "in the absence of external force and torque , the swimmer is force and torque free .",
    "therefore we require that the total force and torque acting on the fluid by the system to be zero . including the point force and its image counter part and adding the contributions due to the translational and rotational motion of large sphere we arrive at the following force and torque balance equations : @xmath40 the fluid velocity field at the location of small sphere is subject to the boundary condition : @xmath41 .",
    "together with this boundary condition , the above equations make a complete set of dynamical governing equations for the swimmer .",
    "to solve the dynamical equations for the system , we can use the force and torque balance conditions and obtain a set of equations which relate the different components of the translational or angular velocities of the system to the component of the vector @xmath42 in the following matrix form : @xmath43 where the detail for of the matrix elements @xmath44_{ij}=a_{ij}$ ] , @xmath45_{ij}=b_{ij}$ ] and @xmath46_{ij}=c_{ij}$ ] are given at the appendix .    , @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath48)-space is plotted for two different values of @xmath49 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "line show the real path of the large sphere .",
    "the swimmer starts its motion from the initial state where the large sphere is located at the origin and the long rod is orientated along the @xmath56 direction .",
    "as one can see , the overall swimming direction can be varied by changing the parameters of the system .",
    "average orientation of the long rod which is not shown here is along the average swimming direction . ]    , @xmath51 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath58 . ]",
    "in this section we will present the numerical solution for the governing equations and obtain the real space trajectory of the swimmer . for this purpose",
    "we plot the trajectory of large sphere . for the prescribed internal motion given by ( [ 21 ] ) and a special choice of parameters",
    ", we have plotted figure [ fig3 ] , the space trajectory of the large sphere . as one can distinguish , the trajectory is a helical - shaped path with overall translational movement in each round .",
    "the different characteristics of the trajectory , preferred direction , average swimming velocity and the effective radius of the helice can be controlled by the geometrical as well as dynamical parameters of the swimmer .",
    "the average orientation of the long rod , which is not shown in figure , is in the direction of the longitudinal axis of helix .",
    "this is achieved by numerically solving for the rotational velocity .",
    "controlling and adjusting the dynamical behavior of the swimmer is of prime importance in designing artificial micro - machines .",
    "here we see that by changing the parameters of the system we can do this favor . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have shown that the overall swimming direction is sensitive to the initial phase @xmath49 .",
    "additionally and as an another example , in figure [ fig4 ] , we have shown that by changing @xmath11 , the length of long rod , the average swimming velocity can be changed .",
    "as the geometry of the two - sphere swimmer is not symmetric , the far field distribution of fluid velocity at the leading order of approximation , resembles a velocity field of a single force dipole .",
    "this is the main characteristic of most swimming microorganisms with , dipole - like velocity pattern .    in summary , inspired by bacterium swimming , we proposed and analyzed a swimmer , constructed by two joint spheres .",
    "we have shown that this simple three - dimensional swimmer is a model for a low reynolds propeller .",
    "captures a number of dynamical features in microorganisms",
    ". it will be interesting to use this model swimmer and study many interesting problems like , the hydrodynamic interaction between such swimmers , the effects due to the confinement in the bounded fluids and also chemotaxis phenomena .",
    "inspired by the colonies of microorganisms , we are extending our model to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction in an ensemble of two - sphere swimmers .",
