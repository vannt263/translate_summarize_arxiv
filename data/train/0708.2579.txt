    "revealing the nature of dark matter has received much more attention since the successive results of the wmap cosmic microwave background all - sky observation@xcite . many dark matter direct search experiments have been concluded@xcite , are currently being performed@xcite , or are in the planning stage@xcite . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are very plausible candidates of dark matter .",
    "most dark matter search experiments are designed to measure only the energy transferred to the nucleus through wimp - nucleus scatterings . in these experiments ,",
    "the distinct signals of wimps are the annual modulation of the energy spectrum .",
    "the halo is isotropic . because the amplitude of an annual modulation signal is only a few  @xmath1 of the rate , positive signatures of wimps are very difficult to detect with these detectors@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the motion of the solar system with respect to the galactic halo is considered to provide a much larger asymmetry in the direction - distribution of the wimp velocity observed at earth@xcite . a detection method of a positive signature of wimps by measuring the directions of the nuclear recoils have been studied@xcite .",
    "if the distribution of the local halo were not isotropic  perhaps quite clumpy direction - sensitive methods would then potentially provide information on it .",
    "gaseous detectors are one of the most appropriate devices to detect this  wimp - wind@xcite .",
    "the drift project has performed underground measurements for more than two years with 1 m@xmath2 time projection chambers ( tpc ) filled with a low - pressure @xmath3 gas aiming to detect the mainly wimp - wind via spin - independent(si ) interactions@xcite . since former studies suggest to perform the wimp - search both via si and spin - dependent(sd )",
    "interactions@xcite , we proposed a sd - sensitive wimp - wind search , named newage ( new generation wimp - search with an advanced gaseous tracking device experiment)@xcite .",
    "we developed a @xmath4-tpc with a detection volume of 23 @xmath5 28 @xmath5 30 @xmath6 and performed a direction - sensitive wimp - search experiment in a surface laboratory .",
    "in this section , we describe the detector performance , which is also described in ref .",
    "we mainly measured the detector response in the energy range that we used for the wimp - search analysis ( 100 - 400kev , dm energy range ) . the lower threshold ( 100kev )",
    "was set at the lowest energy for an effective gamma - ray rejection with a 150 torr @xmath0 gas , and the higher threshold ( 400kev ) was set at the expected highest recoil energy by the wimps at the escape velocity .",
    "a @xmath4-tpc is a gaseous time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber ( @xmath4-pic ) readout .",
    "a @xmath4-pic is a gaseous two - dimensional position - sensitive detector manufactured by printed circuit board ( pcb ) technology .",
    "pcb technology realizes an economical mass production , which is one of the most important requirements to fabricate a dark matter detector . after a general - purposed detector r&d",
    ", we studied the performance of a @xmath4-tpc with a detection volume of @xmath7 using a 150 torr @xmath0 gas as our first step towards a dark matter experiment@xcite . in this study , we demonstrated the tracking of nuclear recoils and the gamma - ray rejection with a @xmath0 gas of 150 torr .",
    "we also found that we need some more studies to operate the @xmath4-tpc with a @xmath0 gas at a design value of 30 torr for more than a few days .",
    "we then developed a large - sized ( 31 @xmath5 31 @xmath8 ) @xmath4-pics@xcite , and subsequently developed a large - volume @xmath4-tpc with a detection volume of 23 @xmath5 28 @xmath5 30 @xmath6 .",
    "we studied the fundamental properties of this large - volume @xmath4-tpc with a standard ar-@xmath9 gas mixture at normal pressure@xcite .",
    "the size is of the @xmath4-pic is restricted by the working size of the pcb , and we plan to realize a larger readout area by placing many pieces , for instance 4 @xmath10 4 pieces for a 1 m@xmath11 , of @xmath4-pics . before we take the next technology steps , we performed a first direction - sensitive spin - dependent dark matter search experiment to demonstrate that a gaseous detector and a direction - sensitive method can actually set limits on the wimps .",
    "we report on the results of a direction - sensitive dark matter search experiment using this large - volume @xmath4-tpc with a 150 torr @xmath0 gas ( 9.0 g effective mass ) in a surface laboratory .",
    "we used the @xmath4-tpc described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and thus most parts of the detector were unchanged .",
    "herein , we describe only the significant properties and the modified parts of the detector system .",
    "figure [ fig : tpc ] is a schematic drawing of the @xmath4-tpc . a @xmath4-pic with a detection area of 31 @xmath5 31 @xmath8",
    "( toshiba / dnp , sn060222 - 3 ) was used as the main gas - multiplier and as readout electrodes . a gas electron multiplier ( gem@xcite ) with an effective area of 23 @xmath5 28 @xmath8 , which was manufactured by a japanese company ( scienergy co. ltd . ) , was used as a pre - amplifier .",
    "the drift length was 31 cm and the detection volume was 23 @xmath5 28 @xmath5 31 @xmath6 .",
    "the electric field of the drift volume was formed with a field - shaping pattern on a fluorocarbon circuit board surrounding the detection volume .",
    "the detector was placed in a 3 mm - thick stainless - steel vacuum chamber filled with 150 torr @xmath0 .",
    "the data - acquisition system , which is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , was triggered by the signals of the @xmath4-tpc itself .",
    "hence , the absolute z position was not measured , but only the relative positions .",
    "typical operation parameters were @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15=8.25kv .",
    "@xmath16 is the voltage supplied to the @xmath4-pic , @xmath17 is the voltage supplied to the top of the gem , @xmath18 is the voltage supplied to the bottom of the gem , and @xmath19 is the voltage supplied to the drift plane .",
    "these parameters were optimized to realize stable operation at a combined ( @xmath4-pic @xmath5 gem ) gas gain of 2300 , which is high enough to maintain the detection efficiency of the recoil nucleus . we still suffer from discharge problems when operating a @xmath4-pic alone .",
    "we calibrated and monitored the energy with alpha particles generated by the @xmath20 ( q=2.7mev ) reaction @xcite .",
    "we set a glass plate coated with a thin 0.6 @xmath4 m @xmath21 layer in the @xmath4-tpc , and irradiated the @xmath4-tpc with thermalized neutrons .",
    "alpha particles ( 5.6  mev , 6.1  mev , and 7.2  mev ) from the decays of the radon progeny were also used . the track - length and the energy - deposition correlation down to the dm energy range agreed with a calculation by srim@xcite .",
    "the measured energy resolution in 58mev was 50@xmath1(fwhm ) , which was dominated by the gain inhomogeneity of the @xmath4-pic .",
    "this would be the worst value when the gain inhomogeneity of the @xmath4-pic dominates the energy resolution .",
    "the energy resolution could be dominated by the the statistics of the primary electrons . in this case",
    ", the energy resolution at 100  kev with a cf@xmath22 gas was estimated from a measurement with an ar-@xmath23 gas mixture , because it is not very easily measured due to a small photo - absorption cross - section and a long range of the electron .",
    "the energy resolution at 60  kev , measured with an ar-@xmath23 gas mixture , was 60@xmath1 ( fwhm)@xcite .",
    "we caliculataed with @xmath24 . here ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energy resolution at 100  kev with a @xmath0 gas and that at 60  kev with an ar-@xmath23 gas mixture , respectively . @xmath27=54ev and @xmath28=26ev are the energies needed to created an ion - electron pair in a @xmath0 gas and an ar-@xmath23 gas mixture , respectively .",
    "thus , the estimated energy resolution was 70@xmath1 ( fwhm ) at 100 kev with a cf@xmath22 gas , if the statistics of the primary electron dominates the energy resolution .",
    "the energy resolution in the dm energy range was therefore estimated to be better than 70@xmath1 .",
    "the nuclear - recoil detection efficiency was measured by irradiating the @xmath4-tpc with fast neutrons from a @xmath29cf source of 0.72 mbq placed at several postitions .",
    "we selected the tracks within the fiducial volume ( 21.5 @xmath5 22 @xmath5 31 @xmath6 ) .",
    "we also required at least three digital hit points for a track .",
    "a typlical track - length and energy - deposition correlation is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : scat252cf ] .",
    "a nuclear recoil band is seen along the x - axis .",
    "we set the upper limit of the `` nuclear recoil band '' at 1 cm . we compared the spectrum after the selection with a simulated one , and the calculated ratio was the overall ( detection and the selection ) efficiency .",
    "the efficiency curve is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : scat252cf ] .",
    "the efficiency was about 40@xmath1 at 100 kev , and the efficiency dependence on the recoil energy was phenomenologicaly fitted with an error function , @xmath30 .",
    "the best - fit function was @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the error function and @xmath33 is the energy in kev .",
    "we demonstrated that the track - length and the energy - deposition correlation measured with a gaseous tpc provided a strong gamma - ray rejection in our previous work@xcite .",
    "we performed quantitive measurements with a large - volume @xmath4-tpc for a wimp - search measurement in a surface laboratory .",
    "we irradiated the @xmath4-tpc with gamma - rays from a @xmath34 source of 0.80 mbq , placed at 25 cm from the center of the detection volume .",
    "the measured track - length and energy - deposition correlations with and without the gamma - ray source are shown in the left and the right panels of figure  [ fig : scat137cs ] , respectively .",
    "the live time was 0.44 days for both measurements . a band along the y - axis labeled `` electron recoil band ''",
    "is seen only in the results with a gamma - ray source , which is obviously due to tracks of the recoil electrons .",
    "another band along the x - axis , seen in both results , is due to the tracks of the carbon and fluorine nuclei by the neutron background , and are labbeled `` nuclear recoil band '' .",
    "the spectra of these two measurements are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : spec137cs ] .",
    "the spectrum of the no - source run was subtracted from the that of the @xmath34 run .",
    "the obtained \" subtracted  spectrum is shown in the right panel of fig   [ fig : spec137cs ] .",
    "the subtracted spectrum is consistent with zero in the dm energy range , within the statistical error .",
    "we then derived the gamma - ray rejection factor by dividing the subtracted spectrum by a simulated electron recoil specrum .",
    "the measured gamma - ray rejection factor in the dm energy ranege was @xmath35 .",
    "the error is statistical , which is dominated by the background in the surface laboratory .",
    "the 90@xmath1 c.l .",
    "upper limit of the gamma - ray rejection factor was @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath4-pic has an anisotropic response with regard to the three - dimensional track directions .",
    "this non - uniform response is due to a difference in the detection method of the z - axis ( time information ) and the other two axes ( 2-dimensional image taken by the @xmath4-pic ) .",
    "we measured this detection efficiency dependence on the track direction , or a  response map  , by irradiating the @xmath4-tpc with fast neutrons from several positions that generated uniform recoils .",
    "we fitted the digital hit points with a straight line , and determined the directions of each nuclear recoil track .",
    "because we did not measure the track senses in this measurement , we fixed the sign of the x component to positive and determined the ( x , y , z ) vector of the track in the coordinates shown in fig  [ fig : tpc ] .",
    "the measured response map is shown in fig  [ fig : responsemap ] .",
    "the map was normalized by a mean value .",
    "it can be seen that the correction factor is quite large because the fabrication technology of the large - sized @xmath4-pic is still in an r@xmath37d phase , and the gain inhomogeniety is still large .",
    "the detector showed a relatively high efficiency for tracks in the x - z and y - z planes , but showed a relatively low efficiency for tracks in the x - y plane .",
    "we have not overcome intrinsic weak points of the tpc that the efficiency to the tracks parallel to the readout plane is relatively low .",
    "it should be noted that the absolute detection efficiency was measured by a method described in the pervious sections , and this response map was used to correct the relative efficiency .",
    "we measured the position resolution using the tracks of the alpha particles measured in the energy calibration .",
    "we evaluated the position resolution using the same method as described in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the measured position resolution was 0.8 mm  ( rms ) .",
    "the angular resolution of the carbon and fluorine nuclei in the dm energy range was estimated in the following manner .",
    "we calculated the sampling pitch of the carbon and fluorine tracks from real data .",
    "we then generated the hit points by a simulation based on the measured position resolution and the sampling pitch .",
    "simulated hit points were fitted with a straight line , and the angle between the fitted line and the real direction was calculated .",
    "the distribution of the calculated angle was fitted with a lorentzian and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a parameter of a lorentzian that corresponds to hwhm .",
    "we used this value for a direction - sensitive analysis .",
    "a dark matter search measurement was performed in a surface laboratory at kyoto university ( @xmath40 @xmath41 n , @xmath42 @xmath43 e , third floor in a five - story building ) .",
    "the measurement was performed from november 1st , 2006 to november 27th , 2006 .",
    "we set the @xmath4-pic plane horizontally and re - aligned the x- and y - axis of the @xmath4-tpc twice ( three different @xmath44 indicated in figure  [ fig : tpc ] ) so as to cancel any remaining static errors . table [ table : tpcoperation ] lists the measurement properties .",
    "the total live time was 16.71 days and the exposure was 0.151 kg@xmath45 days .",
    "the sum of the calibration and maintenance time was 7.51 days , and the dead time due to the data acquisition was 1.0 days .",
    "the @xmath4-tpc was filled with 150 torr @xmath0 , and the vacuum chamber was sealed without any gas circulation .. the drift velocity , total gas gain , and the energy resolution were monitored every two or three days during the measurement .",
    "the drift velocity was 7.6  cm/@xmath4s at the beginning of the measurement and decreased to 6.9  cm/@xmath4s at the end .",
    "this decrease is thought to be due to the out - gas from the detector components .",
    "we used the measured velocities for the analysis .",
    "the mean gas gain in the entire detection area was 2300 , and a time - dependent variation was not observed within a measurement error of 4@xmath46 ( rms ) .",
    "the energy resolution was also stable within a measurement error of 7@xmath46 ( rms ) .",
    "the time - dependence was small compared to the energy resolution , itself , and the angular resolution in this measurement .",
    ".properties of the dark matter measurements . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we next performed a direction - sensitive analysis .",
    "we created a sky map of the north sky with the direction of the three - dimensional nuclear recoil tracks .",
    "because we did not detect the sense of each track , the map was restricted to half of the sky larger and the southern part of the sky was folded .",
    "we plotted every nuclear event ( 1686 events in a 0.151 kg@xmath45days exposure ) in figure  [ fig : skymap ] .",
    "the larger mark , labled \" dm expected  , is the direction of the solar motion or the cygnus from which the wimp - wind is expected .",
    "the wimp - wind direction has a diurnal motion around the polestar .",
    "we calculated @xmath47 , the angle between the wimp - wind direction and the recoil direction for each event , and drew the the @xmath48 distribution shown in figure  [ fig : costheta ] .",
    "we compared this measured @xmath48 distribution with the expected wimp - signal .",
    "the expected wimp - signal was prepared by the following method .",
    "we first created a @xmath48 distribution for a given wimp mass and a recoil energy while considering the energy resolution .",
    "the dm energy range was divided into 15 bins , and the energy and angular resolution of the detector were taken into account .",
    "we used @xmath49 ( fwhm ) for the energy resolution and an angular resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "we followed ref .",
    "@xcite for the angular distribution and ref.@xcite for the count rate .",
    "we then created a sky - map expected by the wimp events with this @xmath48 distribution while considering the derection - dependence(figure  [ fig : responsemap ] ) and the angular resolution .",
    "we used this sky map to create the expected @xmath48 distribution for a given wimp mass and energy bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : costheta ] shows one of these @xmath48 distributions . here",
    ", the data was fitted with the distribution for @xmath50=100gev and 100120 kev bin , and the cross section that gave the minimum @xmath51 was 1.36 @xmath5 @xmath52pb and @xmath53 .",
    "this best - fitted wimp signal was rejected at the 90@xmath1 confidence level by @xmath51 tests .",
    "the cross section that would give the minimum @xmath51 was calculated for each energy bin , and the smallest cross section was taken as the limit for the given wimp mass .",
    "the upper and lower panels in figure  [ fig : limit ] show the cross section limits and the corresponding @xmath51 values as a function of the wimp mass , respectively .",
    "the limits are shown with a thick - solid line ( labeled  direction - sensitive  ) and the @xmath51 values are shown by filled - square marks .",
    "the @xmath51 values at the 90@xmath1 c.l .",
    "upper limit are shown by a dotted line in the lower panel in figure  [ fig : limit ] .",
    "the wimp signals were rejected at the 90@xmath1 confidence level because the best - fit @xmath51 values were all above the 90@xmath1-@xmath51 line .",
    "the data was also fitted with a flat @xmath48 distribution and @xmath54 was obtained independent of the wimp mass .",
    "the flat @xmath48 was not rejected at the 90@xmath1 confidence level .",
    "it was demonstrated that the direction - sensitive method gave a limit slightly better than the conventional spectrum - only method .",
    "the difference between this result and other experiments is explained by the neutron background in the surface laboratory .",
    "this is the first limit set by a dark matter search experiment with a gaseous tracking device . as for the spin - dependent limit , this is the first result by a direction - sensitive experiment .",
    "it should be stressed that the dark matter search experiment with a gaseous tracking device can actually set a limit on the wimps .",
    "these results are very convincing and encouraging towards developing a future wimp - wind detection with large - volume detectors .",
    "we have shown that wimp - proton cross section limits can be obtained by a direction - sensitive method . however , much work is necessary to reach the sensitivity achieved by other experiments performed with solid and liquid detectors .",
    "the sensistivity is restricted by the neutron background in a surface run , therefore , we are going to perform a dark matter search experiment in an underground laboratory .",
    "the fast neutron flux in kamioka observatory ( ( 1.9 @xmath55 0.21 ) @xmath56 ) is more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than a typical fast neutron flux in a surface laboratory .",
    "it it expected that the background sources , such as radioactive isotopes in the detector components , would limit the sensitivity in the first stage of an underground run .",
    "we are going to replace the detector components with low - activity materials .",
    "the angular resolution is not good enough to take full advantage of the direction - sensitive method over the `` spestrum only '' method .",
    "we are going to investigate the detector response using a neutron source of a known energy .",
    "we plan to study the operation of the @xmath4-tpc at a lower pressure of 30 torr to lower the energy threshold .",
    "we are going to develop a larger readout area by placing many pieces of the of @xmath4-pics of 31 @xmath5 31 @xmath8 .",
    "after these technological breakthroughs are achieved , we expect to reach the susy predictions with an exposure of more than one hundred kg@xmath45days , which we have calculated in our previous work@xcite .",
    "we developed a three - dimensional tracking device , and performed a direction - sensitive dark matter search measurement in a surface laboratory . by using 150 torr carbon - tetrafluoride ( @xmath0 ) gas",
    ", we set the first limit on the spin - dependent wimp - proton cross section by a direction - sensitive method .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that a dark matter search experiment with a gaseous tracking device can actually set a limit on wimps .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that this method will potentially play a certain role in revealing the nature of dark matter when a low - background large - volume detector is developed .",
