    "here we focus on @xmath163 the nature of the c - ic transition , and @xmath164 the structure of the correlations emerging as the spin system is partially polarized ( at @xmath33 ) , with the ultimate goal of presenting a phenomenological picture that can be compared to experiments . all calculations ( unless specified ) were performed on two - leg spin ladders of up to 128 rungs , and using 600 dmrg states .",
    "we start by recalling that when @xmath165 , the geometry of the system shown in fig .  1 of the main text , resembles that of two antiferromagnetically coupled sawtooth chains .",
    "therefore , the physics of sawtooth chains , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , may well be closely linked to that of bicu@xmath2po@xmath3 .",
    "for example , the classical ground state expected in bicu@xmath2po@xmath3  for @xmath166 has an incommensurate spin order characterized by a wave vector @xmath167 close to @xmath168 , the value of coupled sawtooth chains @xcite .    at a quantum level ,",
    "the sawtooth chain exhibits spontaneous dimerization @xcite .",
    "however , when the spin chains are coupled in the transverse direction to form a ladder , the rung interactions can dominate @xcite , and the ground state of the system is better described as being formed by strong _",
    "rung singlets_. a strong rung - coupling regime has also been proposed for bicu@xmath2po@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "po@xmath3  spin - ladder model described in the text , calculated relative to the center of the chain .",
    "the rung - rung correlations and the dimer - dimer correlations , both along the same leg and between opposite legs are shown .",
    "b ) dimerization pattern along the legs and rungs of a polarized ladder with a pinning field at the center of one leg .",
    "c ) spin texture surrounding the soliton structure .",
    "the cartoon in the inset illustrates the classical spin texture and the structure of the spin correlations ( thick lines indicate stronger bonds).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to study the system correlations we define the dimerization operators along the leg and rung directions as @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , respectively , with @xmath171 being the leg index .",
    "the dimer order parameter is then defined as @xmath172 , with @xmath38 the site - index along the leg . from our calculations , both @xmath173 and @xmath174 are constant ( except near the open boundaries ) , hence ruling out the presence of a spontaneous dimerization . in the unpolarized ( @xmath175 ) case ,",
    "we find that @xmath176 is much stronger than @xmath177 ( not shown ) , in agreement with ref .  @xcite .",
    "one can go one step further and study the dimer - dimer correlator @xmath178 .",
    "[ fig : dimer]a shows rapidly decaying rung - rung correlations ( calculated from the chain center ) .",
    "this fast decay is consistent with a state of weakly correlated rung singlets . as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer]a , the dimer - dimer correlations along the leg direction indicate a cloud of sharply defined , but rapidly decaying staggered oscillations in a columnar pattern @xcite .    to break the rung singlets and create a nonzero magnetization ,",
    "a critical magnetic field @xmath51 is required . in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "4b of the main text , solitons are formed and an ic @xmath179 modulation is present .",
    "intuitively , solitons can be visualized as spin- qdws breaking the short - range leg dimer order present for @xmath32 and visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer]a . soliton pairs will then behave as triplet excitations with two `` up '' spins on the same rung .",
    "these pairs are weakly correlated along the leg direction and propagate coherently as hard - core bosons ( see also ref .",
    "solitons in bicu@xmath2po@xmath3  behave as weakly interacting extended objects , as shown in figure 4b of the main text .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the results from our dmrg simulations indicate that the detailed spatial structure of the domain walls is more complex .",
    "a careful inspection shows the role of the incommensurate spin correlations with @xmath180 , which are present as a quasi - classical spin texture superimposed on top of a dimerization pattern . to better characterize numerically the spatial profile of solitons",
    ", we added a pinning field at the center of the chain .",
    "the pinning field localizes a spin pointing in the `` up '' direction .",
    "correspondingly , the spin on the same rung but opposite leg spontaneously points in the `` down '' direction .",
    "the surrounding background of spins arranges itself in a classical structure with @xmath181 .",
    "the excess spin `` up '' in the neighboring chain is not localized on the same rung , but it spreads along the second chain over the width of the soliton , preferentially on the two sites to the left and right of the center , at an angle of @xmath182 obtained from the value of @xmath183 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer]c ) .",
    "the soliton structure emerging from our calculations is unusual , and differs from those present in systems with a commensurate spin order .",
    "moreover , due to the different couplings ( @xmath184 ) , the profile of the soliton depends on whether it is situated on even or on odd sites of the leg , similarly to what happens in the sawtooth chains .",
    "notice that the reference position in our calculations corresponds to an odd site on one of the ladder legs .",
    "results for even sites , although quantitatively different , are qualitatively equivalent and hence are not shown here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] we characterize the spin - spin correlations accompanying the fi phases . in the @xmath185 case",
    ", the system is quantum disordered with a lorentzian - like spin structure factor @xmath186 in reciprocal space ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sq]a ) .",
    "once the critical field @xmath51 is reached , @xmath187 and the 1d system starts to develop quasi - long range order .",
    "the latter is manifest in the calculations with a sharp cusp in the spin structure factor , centered at @xmath188 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sq]b and [ fig : sq]c ) .",
    "we also observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq]d that the correlation functions decay more rapidly for the spin components longitudinal to the applied field than for those perpendicular to it .",
    "the latter is a common situation in the gapless phase of two - leg ladders @xcite and implies that in the presence of interladder interactions @xmath189 , magnetic order will first involve the perpendicular component @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that long - range vector chiral order ( breaking a discrete parity symmetry @xmath190 ) can develop even in 1d .",
    "a possible instability towards helical order in case of @xmath191 can be identified by numerically computing the chiral correlations @xmath192 with the chiral operator @xmath193 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] we see that vector chiral correlations are * short - ranged * in the region @xmath194 , whereas a more classical cone is the ordered state realized in the 3d case for @xmath154 .    for @xmath194",
    ", an incommensurate quasi - classical spin order develops around each qdw as the density of solitons increases . as in the case of cugeo@xmath12 @xcite ,",
    "the interactions among solitons are supposed to affect mainly the soliton - soliton distance ( and , in turn , @xmath195 ) but not the correlation length @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , at a critical density @xmath197 corresponding to the inverse soliton width , namely @xmath198 , where @xmath138 is the correlations length , the solitons start to overlap and , due to the soliton - soliton repulsion , become more localized . in our system , we find that this corresponds to the development of long range chiral correlations at @xmath158 .    due to simple energy considerations ,",
    "the longitudinal magnetization parallel to the field develops predominantly on one of the sublattices ( even sites on leg 1 and odd sites on leg 2  see fig .",
    "4b in the main text ) .",
    "the longitudinal magnetization is visible in the spin - spin correlations as a small commensurate feature with @xmath199 .",
    "it is not seen , though , in the structure factor , since the @xmath200 contribution has been subtracted .",
    "notice that this term would also have lead to a peak proportional to @xmath201 at @xmath202 .    to bear out the features associated with the soliton structure ,",
    "we have ignored the effects of dm interactions in the above discussion . adding them would add another degree of complexity to the problem @xcite ."
