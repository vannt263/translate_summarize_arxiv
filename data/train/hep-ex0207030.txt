    "at the high energy of @xmath3 gev delivered by hera using colliding electron ( 27.5 gev ) and proton beams ( 820 gev ) , the deeply virtual compton scattering process ( dvcs ) @xmath4 is of diffractive nature . comparing to the lower energy experiments clas@xcite and hermes@xcite , additionally to the direct quark contribution ( lo contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag1]a ) , the color singlet two gluon exchange is also expected to have a sizable contribution ( nlo - fig .",
    "[ fig : diag1]b ) .",
    "a considerable interest of the dvcs comes from the particular access it gives to generalised parton distributions ( gpd ) through the interference term with the bethe - heitler process .",
    "the high energy situation of h1 and zeus experiments give them the unique opportunity to constrain the gluon contribution to gpds and to study the evolution in  of the quark and gluon distributions .    here",
    "we report the first cross section measurement of the deeply virtual compton scattering , performed by the h1 and zeus experiments .",
    "the cross section measurement are compared to the theoretical predictions and future plans for the dvcs measurement at hera are briefly presented .",
    "both h1 and zeus adopted the same analysis strategy . around the interaction region , h1 and zeus are equipped with tracking devices surrounded by calorimeters . since the proton escapes the main detector through the beam pipe only the scattered electron and photon are measured .",
    "therefore the event selection is based on demanding two electromagnetic clusters , one in the backward ( i.e. the direction of the incoming electron , @xmath5 ) and one in the central or the forward part of the detector ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if a track can be reconstructed it has to be associated to one of the clusters and determines the electron candidate .",
    "these events are then subdivided into two mutually exclusive samples .",
    "control sample _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conf].a ) contains events with the electron candidate detected in the central or the forward part of the detector .",
    "this sample is largely dominated by bethe ",
    "heitler events , although some additional backgrounds due to dilepton production by photon - photon interaction and due to diffractive @xmath7 electroproduction have to be considered  @xcite .",
    "the dvcs contribution is kinematically suppressed by the large  value .",
    "the _ enriched dvcs sample _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conf].b ) , complementary to the control sample , contains both dvcs and bethe  heitler events , and a small background contribution due to @xmath8 and @xmath9 diffractive electroproduction .",
    "[ fig : conf ]    to enhance the dvcs contribution in comparison to the bethe - heitler process the phase space has to be restricted by demanding the photon candidate in the forward part of the detector .",
    "the h1 analysis selects more specifically the elastic component by using , in addition , forward detectors , placed close to the beam pipe , are used to identify particles originating from proton dissociation processes .",
    "both experiments compare their results to the prediction of l.  l.  frankfurt , a.  freund and m.  strikman ( ffs )  @xcite calculated in qcd at lo and leading twist .",
    "it is important to notice that , into this approximation , the interference term cancels out when integrating over the azimuth angle of the final state photon ( as in the analysis here below ) .",
    "therefore the pure dvcs cross section can be measured subtracting the bethe - heitler contribution to the enriched dvcs sample .",
    "this analysis  @xcite is based on a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37  .",
    "the backward electromagnetic cluster is required with an energy above 10 gev , and the central or forward cluster ( @xmath10 ) with more than 3 gev .",
    "the photon virtuality @xmath11 is demanded , the @xmath12 energy , @xmath13 , is such that @xmath14 . the @xmath15 dvcs ( preliminary ) cross section is shown as a function of @xmath0 and of @xmath13 in fig .  [",
    "fig : z_sig ] and is compared to the ffs prediction . the measurement is well described by the ffs prediction assuming a value of @xmath16 gev@xmath17 for the exponential @xmath18 slope .",
    "it has to be noted that the background from the proton dissociation ( around 20% ) has not been subtracted .",
    "in the h1 analysis  @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8  , the dvcs cross section is measured in the kinematic region : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the proton dissociation background has been estimated to of 16%  @xmath22% and is subtracted statistically assuming the same @xmath13 and @xmath0 dependence as for the elastic component .",
    "it may be worth to comment on possible @xmath23 contamination as suffer the dvcs measurements of hermes and clas . due to the high energy regime , the direct @xmath23 production ( via regge pole exchange ) is suppressed , and the possible @xmath23 contamination from tails of low multiplicity dis events is suppressed by the large rapidity gap requirement ( see detailed study in  @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_sig1 ] the total cross sections of the reaction @xmath4 is shown differentialy in @xmath0 and in @xmath13 . the data are compared with the bethe - heitler prediction alone ( normalised on the integrated luminosity ) .",
    "the @xmath24 dvcs cross section , derived subtracting the bethe - heitler contribution and dividing by the virtual photon flux , is shown as a function of @xmath0 and of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_sig2 ] and compared to ffs and donnachie and dosh ( dd )  @xcite predictions .",
    "the description of the data by the calculations is good , in shape and in absolute normalisation when a @xmath18 slope is chosen between 5 and 9  gev@xmath17 covering the measured range for light vector meson production .",
    "although the shapes in @xmath0 and @xmath13 are similar for the zeus ( still preliminary ) and h1 measurements , the absolute cross section measurements are not fully compatible ( different @xmath25 values have to be assumed in the ffs prediction to get an agreement ) .",
    "this underlines the importance of the @xmath18 slope measurement in the future .",
    "in addition to the ffs and dd predictions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : h_sig2 ] , soon after publication , the h1 results have been compared to different predictions by several authors as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : predictions ] ( see caption for the details ) . from those confrontations",
    "one can conclude several things . from the dipole",
    "model prediction confrontations , a good agreement is found when one adopts an approach similar to the one of vector meson electroproduction calculations .",
    "it confirms the diffractive nature of the dvcs process and the validity of the color dipole models .",
    "the qcd calculation confrontation  @xcite is an important success as it consists in the first diffractive process fully calculated and in good agreement with the measurement of h1 but also with the helicity asymmetry measurements of hermes and class ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore the h1 measurement provides the first constraints on the gpds ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for details ) .",

    "hera is presently entering in a high luminosity regime that will accumulate up to 1  until 2006 , including longitudinal polarisation of the lepton beam .",
    "additionally , the h1 detector will be completed by a high acceptance ( above 80 % ) proton spectrometer ( vfps )  @xcite for @xmath26 and @xmath27 gev@xmath1 , where @xmath28 is the proton energy loss .",
    "+ within these conditions , charge and helicity asymmetry measurements will be possible giving access to the real and the imaginary parts of the amplitude separately .",
    "about 4000 dvcs events are expected with @xmath29 gev  @xcite amoung which about half of them will have a scattered proton measured in the vfps .",
