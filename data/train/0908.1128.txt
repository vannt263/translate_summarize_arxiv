    "<S> of particular interest in both the zipper and double - disk systems is the differential motion of the nanobeams or disks , in which the modulation of the gap between the elements creates a large dispersive shift in the internally propagating cavity light field . </S>",
    "<S> it is this type of motion that is strongly coupled to the light field , and for which the dynamical back - action is strongest .    </S>",

    "<S> fem modeling of the mechanics of the double - disk structure indicates a significant frequency splitting between the differential and common modes of motion of the double disk ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b and c ) , primarily due to the difference in the extent of the undercut between the disk layers and the extent of the central pedestal which pins the two disk layers . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that the differential , or `` flapping '' motion , of the undercut disk region has a lower frequency of @xmath45 mhz , whereas the common motion of the disks results in a higher frequency ( @xmath46 mhz ) `` breathing '' motion of the entire double - disk structure .    the rf - spectrum of the transmitted optical intensity through a double - disk cavity , measured using the same fiber probing technique as for the zipper cavity ( app .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ s_x1 ] ) is directly analogous to the atomic response in eit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just as in eit , one can understand the resulting fano lineshape in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the first perspective considers the interference associated with multiple excitation pathways . in the optomechanical system , </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical motion of the flapping mode is thermally excited along two different pathways , either directly into the broadband ( lossy ) flapping mode , or indirectly , through the flapping mode , into the long - lived breathing mode , and then back again into the flapping mode . </S>",
    "<S> the two excitation pathways interfere with each other , resulting in the fano - like resonance in the spectral response of the optically bright flapping mode . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative , but perfectly equivalent view of the coupled optomechanical system considers the dressed states resulting from the internal mechanical coupling . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the internal mechanical coupling renormalizes the broadband flapping mode and the narrowband breathing mode into two dressed mechanical modes , both broadband and optically - bright . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the flapping and breathing mechanical frequencies coincide , the two dressed modes are excited with equal amplitude and opposite phase at the center frequency between the split dressed states . </S>",
    "<S> destructive interference results , suppressing excitation of the mechanical system at the line center . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the mechanical motion becomes purely a trapped _ mechanically - dark _ state , transparent to external excitation . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c , this induced mechanical transparency is a direct analogue to eit in atomic systems @xcite , in which the quantum interference between the transition pathways to the dressed states of the excited electronic state , through either @xmath89 or @xmath90 , leads to an induced spectral window of optical transparency .    despite the intriguing similarities between the optomechanical system studied here and eit in atomic media , there are some important , subtle differences . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the optomechanical system , rather than the linear dipole transition of eit , the interaction corresponds to a second - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic backaction between the cavity field and mechanical motion creates stokes and anti - stokes optical sidebands , whose beating with the fundamental optical wave resonates with the mechanical motion to create / annihilate phonons ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> functionally , this is like coherent stokes and anti - stokes raman scattering , albeit with unbalanced scattering amplitudes resulting from the coloring of the electromagnetic density of states by the optical cavity ( app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ appg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in analogy to eit , it is the modulation signal carried by the incident optical wave ( radio - frequency or microwave photons ) that fundamentally probes / excites the mechanical motion and to which the trapped _ mechanically - dark _ state becomes transparent . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , rather than tuning the rabi - splitting through the intensity of a control beam resonant with the @xmath91 electronic transition ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) , this _ optically - induced mechanical transparency _ is controlled via optical spring tuning of the resonance frequency of the optically bright flapping mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most apt analogy to the optomechanical system can be made to the photonic resonator system shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> the interference in this case is between the two optical pathways composed of the waveguide - coupled low-@xmath7 optical resonator 1 , and the waveguide - decoupled high-@xmath7 resonator 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this interference again leads to a fano - like resonance , or what has been termed coupled - resonator - induced transparency , in the optical cavity transmission  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the studies considered here involve thermal excitation of the optomechanical system , the same phenomena can be excited more efficiently , and with greater control , using external optical means ( app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ appf ] ) . as such , beyond the interesting physics of these devices , exciting application in rf / microwave photonics and quantum optomechanics exist . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the information storage realized through eit  @xcite , optical information can be stored and buffered in the dark mechanical degree of freedom in the demonstrated noms . </S>",
    "<S> this can be realized through a procedure similar to that recently proposed for coupled optical resonators  @xcite in which dynamic , adiabatic tuning of optical resonances are used to slow , store , and retrieve optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding optomechanical system would consist of an array of double - disk resonators , all coupled to a common optical bus waveguide into which an optical signal carrying rf / microwave information would be launched . in this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , a second control optical beam would adiabatically tune the frequency of the optically - bright flapping mode of each resonator , allowing for the rf / microwave signal to be coherently stored in ( released from ) the long - lived breathing mode through adiabatic compression ( expansion ) of the mechanical bandwidth  @xcite . in comparison to the all - photonic system , optomechanical systems have several advantages , primarily related to the attainable lifetime of the dark mechanical state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the radial breathing mechanical mode of a similar whispering - gallery cavity has been shown to exhibit a lifetime of more than 2 ms  @xcite , a timescale more than seven orders of magnitude longer than that in demonstrated photonic - coupled - resonator systems  @xcite and comparable with eit media  @xcite . moreover , mechanical lifetimes of more than one second have recently been demonstrated using stressed silicon nitride nanobeam  @xcite and nanomembrane  @xcite mechanical resonators operating in the mhz frequency regime . in the quantum realm , such a system operating in the good - cavity or sideband - resolved regime ( by increasing either the optical @xmath7 factor @xcite or the mechanical frequency ) , would reduce the _ simultaneous _ creation and annihilation of stokes and anti - stokes photons , enabling efficient information storage and retrieval at the single - quanta - level suitable for quantum state transfer . </S>"
