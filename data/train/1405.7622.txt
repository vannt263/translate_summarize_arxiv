    "epidemic spreading in complex networks such as biological populations and computer networks is of great interest , both for practical applications and from a fundamental point of view @xcite .",
    "simple models , like the contact process ( cp ) @xcite has been introduced and studied intensively by various techniques .",
    "they can also be considered as simple models of information spreading in social @xcite or in brain networks @xcite . in these models sites",
    "can be infected ( active ) or susceptible ( inactive ) .",
    "infected sites propagate the epidemic to all of their neighbors , with rate @xmath1 , or recover ( spontaneously deactivate ) with rate @xmath2 .",
    "the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) @xcite model differs slightly from the cp , in which the branching rate is normalized by @xmath3 , the number of outgoing edges of a vertex permitting an analytic treatment via symmetric matrices . by decreasing the infection ( communication ) rate of the neighbors",
    "a continuous phase transition may occur at some @xmath4 critical point from a steady state with finite activity density @xmath5 to an inactive one , with @xmath6 .",
    "the latter is also called absorbing , since no spontaneous activation of sites is allowed . in case of the sis @xmath7 in networks with a degree distribution decaying slower than an exponential @xcite .",
    "the transition type is continuous and belongs to the directed percolation universality class @xcite .    in real systems",
    "various heterogeneities occur , that may cause deviations from the results of the homogeneous models . from the homogeneous system point of view",
    "if the disorder varies rapidly both in space and time , its contribution can be described by an increased temperature or noise of the system @xcite . in the quasi - static limit , when the variation of the heterogeneity is much slower the dynamics of the pure model we can consider it as a quenched disorder .",
    "it causes a memory effect , whose relevancy has been studied in quantum and nonequilibrium systems ( see @xcite ) .    in networks , with finite topological dimension , defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of nodes within the ( chemical ) distance @xmath10 , it was shown @xcite , that disorder can be relevant .",
    "heterogeneities can induce arbitrarily large , rare - regions ( rr ) , changing their state exponentially slowly as the function of their sizes , induce so called griffiths phases ( gp ) @xcite . in these phases",
    "the dynamics is slow and non - universal and at the phase transition point it is even slower , logarithmic dynamical scaling may occur .",
    "these heterogeneities can be explicit features of the interactions or maybe the result of the topology of the graph .",
    "recent observations show generically slow time evolution in various system .",
    "for example in the working memory of the brain @xcite or in recovery processes following virus pandemics @xcite power - law type of time dependencies have been found , resembling of dynamical critical phenomena @xcite . in social networks",
    "the occurrence of generic slow dynamics was suggested to be the result of the non - markovian , bursty behavior of agents in small world networks @xcite .",
    "very recently it has been shown @xcite , that bursty dynamics can arise naturally , in network models as the consequence of power - law decaying auto - correlations due to the _ collective behavior of markovian variables .",
    "_    disorder effects are stronger in quantum systems , where the thermal noise does not fade effects of the quenched noise . however , in several cases the critical behavior is dictated by an infinitely strong disorder fixed point , resulting in robust universality classes , that can be observed even in classical models . in particular ,",
    "the same universal behavior occurs in disordered quantum ising chains and the cp @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the cp far in the absorbing state , can be mapped to the quantum - mechanical one , described by the disordered hamiltonian of the anderson type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "heterogeneous mean field ( hmf ) theory provides a good approximation in network models , when the fluctuations are irrelevant @xcite .",
    "to describe quenched disorder in networks the so - called quenched mean - field ( qmf ) approximation is introduced @xcite and heterogeneities of the steady state are quantified by calculating the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) of the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix .",
    "effects of the quenched disorder on the dynamical behavior of sis have recently been compared using qmf approximations in different network models .",
    "numerical evidences have been provided for the relation of _ localization to rr effects , that slows the dynamics @xcite . _    the success of this relation is the consequence of the fact that gp effects arise even in the active phase , where localization of the steady state can be traced by the ipr value .",
    "although for best understanding the effects of dynamical fluctuations should also be taken into account , such approaches , like renormalization group methods ( rg ) @xcite have some limitations .",
    "for example , strong disorder rg works around an infinite disorder fixed point , which is not always present , still griffiths singularities can co - exist with the clean critical behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this method can not handle models with pure topological inhomogeneity .    in this work",
    "i show that the qmf theory describes localization in the one - dimensional sis model , with quenched disorder , in agreement with the expectation that rr effects and gp should occur below the critical point .",
    "i extend previous localization studies by considering distributions of the ipr and eigenvalues , casting more light on the localization transition of sis in various complex networks .",
    "in particular , i investigate sis on scale - free ( sf ) networks , possessing @xmath11 degree distributions and provide numerical evidence for a localization transition at @xmath0 .    very recently",
    "moretti and muoz @xcite have investigated hierarchical , brain networks by simulations and qmf approximations .",
    "they gave a brief overview about the relation of slow dynamics and lifschitz tails in synchronization and spreading models @xcite .",
    "lifschitz tails have provided valuable information in regular , equilibrium systems about the griffiths singularities ( see for example @xcite ) . in network models",
    "they have been studied in mathematics literature mainly @xcite . in graph theory",
    "there is a growing interest in spectral properties of linear operators , mostly of the adjacency matrix or the graph laplacian ( see for example @xcite ) . in physics literature",
    "samukhin et al .",
    "@xcite provided analytical forms for the laplacian spectrum of complex random networks and for the dynamical two - point functions of random walks running on them .",
    "they pointed out that the minimum degree of vertexes , is important for the dynamics , which is related to the lower edge of the laplacian . on the other hand",
    "numerical evidences have been shown that the spectral gaps at the lower edge describe well the slow - down of dynamics due to disorder in models like the cp @xcite or by synchronization transition @xcite .",
    "this is based on the validity of linearization near the phase transition point . in this case the probability distribution at the lower tail of the laplacian can be considered the density of states , the lifschitz tail of the disordered network model .",
    "if it holds it enables us to describe the dynamics near the critical point . in this study",
    "i calculate the lower tail distributions of the laplacian of the networks considered and test how well does it describe the gp behavior of the sis .",
    "starting from the master equation for state vectors of site occupancies , @xmath12 where @xmath13 or @xmath14 , one can derive the qmf theory for the sis model @xcite .",
    "although qmf neglects the dynamical correlations , it can take into account heterogeneities of the network by considering the vector of infection probabilities @xmath15 of node @xmath16 at time @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19 is an element of the adjacency matrix and @xmath20 describes the possibility of weights attributed to the edges . for large times",
    "the sis model evolves into a steady state , with an order parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this equation with @xmath22 symmetric weights can be treated by a spectral decomposition on an orthonormal eigenvector basis .",
    "furthermore the non - negativity of the @xmath23 matrix involves a unique , real , non - negative largest eigenvalue @xmath24 .    for @xmath25",
    "the system evolves into a steady state and the infection probabilities can be expressed via @xmath26 as @xmath27 the order parameter ( prevalence ) @xmath21 becomes finite above an epidemic threshold @xmath28 . in the qmf approximation one finds @xmath4 and @xmath29 around it from the principal eigenvector .",
    "using a taylor expansion of @xmath5 one can solve eq .",
    "( [ sis2 ] ) and find that the threshold is related to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath26 as : @xmath30 .",
    "the order parameter near , above @xmath4 can be approximated via @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the coefficients @xmath33 \\ , \\label{epsilon}\\ ] ] are functions of eigenvectors @xmath34 of the largest eigenvalues ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath26 .",
    "this expression is exact , if there is a gap between @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite and tested on weighted barabasi - albert models @xcite that the localization of activity in the active steady state can be characterized by the @xmath38 value , related to the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue @xmath39 as @xmath40 this quantity disappears as @xmath41 in case of homogeneous eigenvector components or remains finite if the activity is concentrated on a finite number of nodes .",
    "besides ipr calculation , that works in the active steady state , some other way to check rr effects would be desirable .",
    "the study the spectrum tail of the laplacian will be introduced here in the hope of providing information about gps below the critical point of the sis .",
    "the laplacian matrix of a graph is defined as @xmath42 which takes values @xmath43 for pairs of connected vertexes and the degree @xmath44 in the diagonal .",
    "the laplacian is positive - semi - definite , i.e. : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the smallest non - zero eigenvalue @xmath47 is called the spectral gap .    near the critical point , in the inactive phase we can linearize the dynamical equation of sis ( [ qmfsis ] ) as @xmath48 we can rewrite it , using the weighted ( symmetric ) laplacian matrix @xcite @xmath49 which has the sums of weights in the diagonal , expressed by the kronecker delta ( @xmath50 ) , as follows @xmath51 \\rho_i(t )   - \\lambda \\sum_j   l_{ij}\\rho_j(t ) \\ .\\ ] ] a linear stability analysis can be performed above the critical point , similarly to the synchronization process @xcite . for the normal modes of the perturbations above the absorbing state we can write @xmath52 by this approximation we replaced the diagonal elements in eq .",
    "( [ eql ] ) , from @xmath43 to @xmath53 , which increases the spontaneous recovery rate @xmath54 of sites , pushing the system deeper into the inactive phase . in spreading models",
    "it is known that the value of @xmath54 can modify non - universal quantities , shift @xmath4 , but in the inactive phase , where this approach is applied , it is not expected to induce relevant rr effects , it can make them weaker and harder to detect .",
    "however , i have confirmed this approximation in case of cp on networks with purely topological disorder .    using the spectrum of @xmath55 one can make the eigenvalue expansion @xmath56 where @xmath57 is @xmath16-th the component of the @xmath58-th eigenvector of the laplacian .",
    "the total density is determined by the lowest eigenvalues of the spectrum @xmath59 for any network . in finite systems",
    "there is always a finite @xmath60 gap , causing exponential cutoff in the decay of the order parameter . in this study",
    "i consider @xmath61 above @xmath47 , i.e. shift the numerically obtained distributions to zero and express @xmath62 as the laplace transform of @xmath63 ) in the continuum limit @xmath64 where @xmath65 corresponds to the experimentally determined end of tail value of the finite network .",
    "note , that the control parameter @xmath1 appears as a constant , which can induce non - universal power - laws in the inactive gp .",
    "one can also take into account the original diagonal elements of ( [ eql ] ) , if one considers the cp instead of sis , where the interactions are normalized by the degree as @xmath66 . in case of purely topological heterogeneities",
    "the linearized , governing equation takes the form : @xmath67 thus the sum of non - diagonal elements : @xmath68 is constant : @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of the matrix @xmath69 is the linear combination of the normalized laplacian : @xmath70 for such models .",
    "therefore , by performing a spectral analysis of @xmath71 we can investigate the lower gap behavior .",
    "the penalty is that we have non - symmetric matrices , which can be diagonalized by slower algorithms .",
    "i have determined this spectrum for uncorrelated random and generalized small networks ( for definition see later sections ) and found tails very similar as that of sis , except from the linear transformation .",
    "for comparison i calculated the laplacian eigenvalue spectrum of the erds rnyi ( er ) @xcite graph with @xmath72 nodes and @xmath73 average degree .",
    "averaging over @xmath74 random graph realizations and histogramming , with the bin size @xmath75 one can determine numerically the probability distribution @xmath76 in the region @xmath77 .",

    "contrary , for a power - law distributed @xmath61 the laplace transformation results in a power - law decaying density @xmath85 which suggests a gp behavior for the model .",
    "therefore , in the following sections i determine numerically @xmath61 for certain models and determine how well can the tail behavior be fitted by a power - law form . by knowing dynamical simulation results about the existence of gps in these systems i test the predicting power of this approach .",

    "assumption of a power - law fit form provides : @xmath207 .",
    "unfortunately the differences observed between the power - law and stretched exponential tail behaviors are rather small .",
    "this is probably due to the limitation of computing high precision @xmath61 for large sizes .",
    "this puts a question mark on the applicability of the lifschitz tail method in general .",
    "probability distributions of the inverse participation ratio have been calculated in various network models exhibiting explicit or topological heterogeneities .",
    "careful finite size scaling analysis pointed out the emergence of localization in generalized small world and scale - free models .",
    "this method describes well the gp singularities both in one - dimensional sis with interaction disorder and in gsw - s with topological heterogeneity .",
    "localization , appearing in the active phase signals gp singularities there .",
    "former dynamical simulations in case of generalized small world networks @xcite support this . in infinite dimensional systems like er graphs or ba networks gp - s with slow dynamics have been shown to appear only in weighted models @xcite .",
    "in sf models with pure topological disorder the simulations have been concentrated on the location of the critical point by calculating stationary quantities @xcite and visible gp effects have not been reported yet .",
    "only loop - less ba trees showed non - trivial phase transition by very extensive density decay simulations @xcite . this just corresponds to the localization point , thus one can expect more rare - region effects for @xmath175 sf networks .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations indicate a time window , with a power - law like approach to the steady state .    on the other hand the lower spectral tail of the laplacian describes behavior in the inactive phase . in the linear approximation",
    "this is related to the dynamics of the order parameter .",
    "the predictive power of the lifschitz tail method has been investigated and found qualitative agreement with the expectations .",
    "finite systems exhibit spectral gaps , above which power - law tails were found , when gp behavior is expected .",
    "fat tail distributions of the adjacency matrix of sf were already shown in @xcite .",
    "this study suggests the existence of sis network models with fat - tailed laplacians .",
    "however , calculation of the lifschitz tail numerically is a demanding task , not much easier than simulation of the time dependent order parameter .",
    "furthermore , since qmf predicts @xmath7 for sf and gsw networks one can not deeply be in the inactive phase of sis , where the method is expected to work in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "application of these methods to sf networks results in a localization transition at @xmath208 both for correlated and uncorrelated graphs .",
    "this is in agreement with the very recent simulation results , discussed in @xcite and with the threshold , where the degree fluctuations @xmath209 diverge in the hmf approximation @xcite due to the strong heterogeneities .",
    "the localization in the active phase suggests dynamical rr effects for @xmath175 , like in the models presented in @xcite .",
    "however , for sis , where @xmath7 is expected to be in the thermodynamic limit , this implies a smeared phase transition , with an algebraic decaying density in a time window towards the active steady state value .",
    "this scenario is feasible , because subspaces of an infinite dimensional graph can be rr - s with arbitrary topological dimensions exhibiting phase transition at different @xmath1-s , as suggested in @xcite . according to @xcite for large @xmath196-s hubs sustain the epidemic processes instead of the the innermost , dense core",
    ", thus one may expect that hubs play the role of rr - s here .",
    "in finite networks the smeared phase transition may also look like multiple phase transitions .",
    "the success of the qmf method for describing gp behavior is demonstrated here for sis in basic network models . however , the linearization @xcite and the complete neglection of dynamical fluctuations @xcite warn for limitations on this relatively fast method , especially when the strong fluctuations override the localization effects .",
    "the appearance of strong rr effects above the upper critical dimension @xcite supports , that qmf method is capable to predict exotic gp - s with off - critical , power - law singularities .",
