    "the observation of phonon structure in tunneling data for superconducting materials became a very important diagnostic tool in the 1960 s @xcite .",
    "following this initial success attempts were made ( with some degree of success ) to extract similar information in the normal state @xcite .",
    "part of the difficulty at the time no doubt was due to the fact that calculations using many - body green functions predicted that no phonon structure should be present in the electronic density of states ( edos ) @xcite . when the bare edos is infinitely wide and featureless and when particle - hole symmetry is present , the dressed edos retains its constant bare band value and the phonon signatures drop out . on the other hand , as was studied extensively in the 1980 s ( see for instance @xcite ) , phonon renormalizations do enter when the edos has significant energy dependence near the fermi surface on the scale of phonon energies .    more recently @xcite it was realized that phonon structure can also arise when a finite band cutoff is applied in the edos on the scale of the bandwidth . in this letter",
    "we want to accomplish two goals : first we want to understand under what conditions these structures can be resolved in angle integrated photo emission spectroscopy ( aipes ) and/or tunneling even for relatively broad bands , and secondly , we wish to establish the scale of the structures for parameters more specific to a real narrow band material , in this case k@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "while our primary interest here is in the edos we also provide comparison with other spectroscopic quantities such as the real and imaginary parts of the quasiparticle self energy and its optical counterpart , the memory function , both of which have phonon signatures even when the band is assumed to be infinite .",
    "it is well known that even when these structures are not directly visible , as in the optical scattering rate , they can be emphasized either by differentiation @xcite , or extracted by other more sophisticated `` inversion '' procedures @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "the phonon structures due to a finite bandwidth are more readily detectable .    to see sizeable features in the edos , the electron - phonon interaction must be sufficiently strong . to be specific",
    "we consider the eliashberg @xmath3 function appropriate to the intermediate coupling strength superconductor k@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "we start with a large bare bandwidth @xmath4  ev and find that for the clean system and at low temperature the phonon structure in the renormalized edos is very prominent in the range of phonon energies ( keep in mind that for an infinite bandwidth the structure is absent ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of impurity scattering does not obliterate the structure ; it merely reduces its size @xcite . reducing the bare bandwidth to @xmath5  ev , a value more relevant for k@xmath1c@xmath2",
    ", we find that all dominant features of the renormalized edos are determined by the electron  phonon interaction .",
    "we use the following model for the bare electronic band : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bare band width and @xmath8 is the step function . the constant @xmath9 is fixed by normalization : @xmath10 . in this letter",
    "we retain particle - hole symmetry for simplicity , with the chemical potential at the center of the band , @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic self energy @xmath12 is calculated from the migdal equations formulated in the mixed real  imaginary axis representation @xcite : @xmath13 \\eta ( z-\\omega ) + \\left [ f(\\omega + z)+n(\\omega ) \\right ] \\eta ( z+\\omega ) \\right\\ } , \\label{self - energy } \\\\",

    "phonon spectral function @xmath18 ( the eliashberg function ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 , which has the meaning of an impurity scattering rate , specifies the strength of the interaction with impurities .",

    "the variable @xmath21 can assume arbitrary complex values .",
    "at first , the solutions for @xmath20 are sought on the imaginary axis , at @xmath22 , where eq .",
    "( [ self - energy ] ) is simpler .",
    "then , the function @xmath23 is used to set up an iterative procedure to find @xmath24 just above the real axis ( we use @xmath25 as shorthand for @xmath26 ) . while we will focus on the edos , which can be determined in aipes experiments , the real axis self energy , both its real and imaginary parts ,",
    "can be obtained from the angular - resolved photoemission .",

    "( [ three - freq - model ] ) .",
    "we note that increasing the impurity scattering does not smear out the predicted phonon structure , rather it reduces the effective step drop . on the other hand , comparison of the inset with the main frame shows that temperature does smooth out the curves considerably , but even for the worst case @xmath58 k and @xmath59 mev , the structure in @xmath60 remains .",
    "for the chosen parameters , which are not extreme , instrument resolution does not have a strong smearing effect .",
    "we also used a representative extended @xmath18 with the same @xmath38 and position of the peaks as in eq .",
    "( [ three - freq - model ] ) . in this case",
    "the results ( dashed curve ) for @xmath53 and @xmath60 are indistinguishable on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig - dos - resolut ] .",
    "another way to detect the finite band phonon structures in the edos is through tunneling spectroscopy .",

    "[ fig - dos - iv ] we show @xmath69 vs @xmath70 for a narrow band  wide band case ( upper pair of curves ) and for the case where the same narrow band metal is on both sides ( lower pair of curves ) . the impurity scattering rate is @xmath71 mev and the two temperatures shown are @xmath55 k and @xmath72 k. in both cases the phonon structures are clearly identifiable in the differential conductance even at higher temperatures .",
    "the upper curves are almost identical to normalized edos @xmath73 ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - dos - resolut ] ) .",
    "features in the lower curves are about twice as large in magnitude as in the upper curves .",
    "finite band effects are enhanced when the same narrow band metal is used on each side of tunnel junction .",
    "for characterization of the optical response the quantity of interest is the memory function .",
    "its real and imaginary parts are @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , where @xmath76 is the optical scattering rate and @xmath77 is the optical mass renormalization @xcite .",

    "the effect of increasing the impurity content is to push the curves up corresponding to a larger value of the residual scattering . beyond this effect",
    "there are changes in phonon structures , but little smearing .",
    "the structures are much more visible in the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath97 ( steps ) than in the corresponding optical quantity @xmath98 which has only small kinks at frequencies related to the three oscillators of the model @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "( [ three - freq - model ] ) . of course",
    ", it is well known that optical data is encoded with the information on the phonons even in the infinite band case .",
    "however , a second derivative of the data is required @xcite , and this is normally not as accurate .    in fig .  [ fig - omlam - self1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath99 ( solid curves ) and @xmath100 ( dashed curves ) for the same values of @xmath101 as those for fig .",
    "[ fig - tau - self2 ] . in this case",
    "both quantities become smaller as impurity scattering increases in the frequency range shown .",
    "note that all curves cross zero , which is a characteristic of finite bands .",
    "the crossing frequency depends on @xmath101 for both @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with the former dependence stronger .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig - omlam - self1 ] the phonon structures are again much more prominent in the self energy as compared with its optical counterpart .",
    "so far we have considered the case of a rather wide though finite electronic band with full width @xmath4 ev where @xmath102 and the phonon structures in edos have a generic form . however , band structure calculations for one family of the known narrow materials  fulleride compounds  give a much smaller value @xmath103 ev  @xcite .",
    "one expects that in this situation many of the discussed features should be significantly enhanced @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig - dos - fullerid ] we present the renormalized edos @xmath53 as a function of frequency @xmath25 at @xmath55 k for the model @xmath104 of eq .",

    "[ fig - dos - fullerid ] we see that inclusion of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction modifies the entire band , even for the modest value of @xmath110 .",
    "the renormalized edos extends well beyond @xmath112 mev .",
    "note that what determines the energy of the highest steep drop in @xmath53 is not the bare band edge but rather the energy of the third phonon mode @xmath113 mev , which has the strongest coupling to band electrons in the model of eq .",
    "( [ three - freq - model ] ) . beyond this energy",
    "the multiphonon structures appear , with magnitude depending both on @xmath38 and on @xmath101 ; this extends the renormalized band beyond @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",

    "we note that the model of @xmath104 defined in eq .",
    "( [ three - freq - model ] ) is expected to work reasonably well even for two dimensional samples of fullerides because the stronger coupled @xmath116 mode is associated mainly with intramolecular vibrations of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the flat bare edos is also appropriate for the two dimensional electonic bands .",
    "we conclude that in a very narrow band metallic material the electron ",
