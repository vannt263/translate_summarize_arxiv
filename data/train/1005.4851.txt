    "the invariance of the product of charge conjugation ( @xmath4 ) , parity ( @xmath5 ) and time reversal ( @xmath6 ) @xmath0 is one of the most fundamental symmetries in physics and it is indeed related intimately with lorentz invariance .",
    "the @xmath0 theorem @xcite states that any local quantum field theory ( qft ) which is lorentz invariant and has a hermitian hamiltonian must have @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the general theoretical proof of @xmath0 invariance in particle physics along with accurate experimental tests of @xmath0 violation ( @xmath7 ) provides an attractive candidate signature for non particle physics such as string theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the assumptions needed to prove @xmath0 theorem are invalid for strings which are extended objects . moreover , since the critical string dimensionality is greater than four , it is possible that higher dimensional lorentz invariance breaking would be incorporated in a realistic model .",
    "greenberg has shown that @xmath0 violation implies violation of lorentz invariance , but , cpt invariance is not sufficient for out - of - cone lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "consequences of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillation have been discussed in @xcite . briefly , for @xmath8 flavor oscillation probabilities @xmath9 at a distance @xmath10 from the source is the following . if @xmath11 then @xmath3 is not conserved . if @xmath12 then @xmath6-invariance is violated . if @xmath13 then @xmath0 is violated .",
    "also it has been shown that matter effects give rise to apparent @xmath3 _ and _ @xmath0 violation even if the mass matrix is @xmath3 conserving .    at the experimentally accessible energies ,",
    "the signals for lorentz and @xmath7 have been described by a class of extensions of the standard model ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the low energy probes of these new physics have been explored in many experiments with current technologies @xcite .",
    "a summary on measured and derived values of the coefficients for lorentz and @xmath7 in smes have been nicely tabulated in @xcite for matter , photon and gravity sectors .",
    "the sme framework predicts several unusual phenomena in neutrino oscillation , among which are neutrino - antineutrino oscillation , directional dependence , unconventional energy behavior @xcite .",
    "these effects have been explored with recent experimental data at minos @xcite and at lsnd @xcite and new bounds have been obtained .",
    "the effect of perturbative lorentz and @xmath7 on neutrino oscillation has also been studied in @xcite with leading order corrections arising from renormalizable operators including the above phenomena .",
    "more consequences of different smes of lorentz and @xmath7 in neutrino oscillation can be found in @xcite for atmospheric solar and baseline experiments as well as in @xcite for ultra - high energy neutrino experiments .    with an effective - theory approach ,",
    "a plausible spontaneous @xmath0 violating minimal extension of standard model that are also lorentz invariance violating ( lv ) has been done in @xcite for dirac particles and in @xcite for majorana particles .",

    "if we choose a preferred frame in which the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) is isotropic , then the rotational invariance implies no directional dependence for @xmath23 @xcite .    in presence of lv , one can obtain the same effective hamiltonian by considering a modified dispersion relation for neutrinos , @xmath24 . using the rotational invariance in the cmbr frame and demanding lorentz invariance at low energy",

    "the lsnd result @xcite when combined with the solar and atmospheric neutrino observations indicated three distinct neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "then it was proposed that the cpt violating effects may be large enough to make the neutrino and antineutrino spectra significantly different @xcite . however",
    ", this fact was found not to be viable when combined with other neutrino experiments @xcite , and the subsequent data of oscillations corresponding to @xmath33 in antineutrinos at kamland @xcite ruled it out .",
    "the cpt violation is not required to explain any neutrino oscillation data if the lsnd results are ignored in the light of the negative results of miniboone @xcite that explore the same parameter space .",
    "however , the current uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite , allow the possibility to study cpt violating effects in neutrino oscillations , which may be observed or constrained at the future high precision neutrino oscillation experiments .    from the present experimental data , in ref .",

    "the three flavor analysis of @xmath7 is mainly needed to account properly the matter effect and @xmath3 violating phases .",
    "if @xmath23 is not diagonal in mass basis , one needs to introduce an unitary matrix @xmath38 to diagonalize it .",
    "the matrix @xmath38 then needs three angles @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and six phases for a complete parametrization and it can be written as _ b(\\{_b_ij } ; \\{_bi};\\{_bi};_b ) & & + = diag(1 , e^i_b2 , e^i _",

    "this makes the marginalization of the data practically impossible with normal cpus .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have analyzed @xmath7 for three flavor case and have treated the effect of the cpt violating term as a perturbation parametrized by a dimensionless auxiliary parameter @xmath47 . finally , they identify the combinations of cpt violating parameters that contribute to the probabilities to leading order in @xmath48 and compare the signals in different channels to estimate the extent to which these cpt violating combinations can be constrained or identified in future long baseline experiments .    in this paper , we assume @xmath49 matrix to be diagonal in mass basis .",
    "then , there arises only two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we have introduced a new method following ref .",
    "@xcite , where diagonal @xmath49 matrix directly comes into the picture .",
    "so , in this formalism , there is no need to transfer @xmath49 to flavor basis . here",
    ", we have also assumed a preferred frame in which the cmbr is isotropic , then the rotational invariance implies no directional dependence for @xmath23 @xcite .    then with this three flavor formalism",
    ", we have studied @xmath7 with atmospheric neutrinos for a magnetized ical detector proposed at the india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) @xcite considering the muons ( directly measurable quantities at ical ) . in this type of detector",
    ", one can separate neutrinos and antineutrinos due to the magnetic field .",
    "we have incorporated @xmath7 interactions in a new way where two @xmath7 terms come directly in the oscillation probability without any approximation .",

    "this equation is for neutrinos and for antineutrinos , the sign of @xmath66 and @xmath67 will be reversed and @xmath68 will be replaced by @xmath69 .",

    "the row @xmath80 of @xmath78 matrix describes the state @xmath81 which is a mass eigen state at the starting point @xmath82 and column @xmath83 describes the amplitude for evolving into the mass eigen state @xmath84 at time @xmath58 .",

    "we have developed a numerical program considering the above formalism using preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite for the density profile of the earth to find @xmath78 and then the oscillation probabilities .",
    "we have checked that when @xmath90 , the result matches exactly with the other methods of finding oscillation probabilities in matter .",
    "we have studied the atmospheric neutrino data for the magnetized ical detector considering the muon energy and direction ( directly measurable quantities ) of the events in context of cpt violation . due to relatively heavy mass of muon",
    ", it looses energy mostly via ionization and atomic excitation during its propagation through a medium .",
    "since ical is a tracking detector , it gives a clean track in the detector .",
    "the muon energy can be measured from the bending of the track in magnetic field or from track length in case of fully contained event .",
    "the direction can be measured from the tangent of the track at the vertex . from the geant @xcite simulation of ical detector ,",
    "it is clear that the energy and angular resolutions of the muons are very high ( 4 - 10% for energy and 4 - 12% for zenith angle ) and negligible compared to the resolutions obtained from the kinematics of the scattering processes . in our analysis , we neglect the effect arisen due to the properties of the detector .    a new method for migration from true neutrino energy and zenith angle to muon energy and zenith angle has been introduced in @xcite and subsequently used in @xcite .",
    "here we used nuance - v3 @xcite for generating the events .",
    "the addition of the hadron energy to the muon energy , which might improve the reconstructed neutrino energy resolution , is not considered here for conservative estimation of the sensitivity .",
    "it would be realistic in case of geant - based studies since the number of hits produced by the hadron shower strongly depends on the thickness of iron layers .",
    "the @xmath91 is calculated according to the poisson probability distribution .",
    "the binning the data is made in 2-dimensional grids in the plane of @xmath92 - @xmath93 . for each set of oscillation parameters ,",
    "we integrate the oscillated atmospheric neutrino flux folding the cross section , the exposure time , the target mass , the efficiency and the two dimensional energy - angle correlated resolution functions to obtain the predicted data for the @xmath91 analysis .",
    "we use the charge current cross section of nuance - v3 @xcite and the honda flux in 3-dimensional scheme @xcite .",
    "this method has been introduced in @xcite , but the number of bins and resolution functions have been optimized later @xcite .",
    "the method for migration of number of events from neutrino to muon energy and zenith angle bins , the number of bins , the systematic uncertainties , and the cuts at the near horizons are described in @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental data for @xmath91 analysis have been generated in the same way by migrating number of events from neutrino to muon energy and zenith angle bins using the resolution functions , which has been used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we marginalize the @xmath91 over the oscillation parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for both normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy with @xmath98s and @xmath99s separately for a given set of input data .",
    "then we find the total @xmath91 as @xmath100 .",
    "we have chosen the range of @xmath101ev@xmath102 , @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106ev@xmath102 and @xmath107 however , the effect of @xmath34 comes in the subleading order in the oscillation probability when @xmath108 gev and it is marginal .",
    "we have set the inputs of @xmath109ev@xmath102 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we have studied the atmospheric neutrino oscillation for 1 mton.year exposure ( which is 10 years run of 100 kton ) of ical .",
    "the bounds on @xmath96 and @xmath97 are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : bchi ] .",
    "it is found that the bounds are stronger for @xmath112 than its nonzero values .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "the atmospheric neutrinos covers wide ranges of @xmath55 and @xmath10 .",
    "the matter effect only plays role for neutrino with normal hierarchy and for antineutrinos with inverted hierarchy .",
    "the matter resonance occurs in a limited zone of @xmath113 plane when @xmath1 is nonzero .",
    "the resonance zones squeeze rapidly with decrease in @xmath1 values , while the @xmath7 contribution is independent of energy , baseline and @xmath1 values .",
    "so , the @xmath7 effect is only smeared out to some extent due to matter effect and bounds are weaker .",
    "it is very important to note that no ` fake ' @xmath7 signal is arisen with atmospheric neutrinos , which may be the possibility in case of baseline experiments .",
    "we have shown that a strong bound of @xmath2 gev at 99% cl can be obtained at a magnetized ical detector at ino , which is much stronger , almost one order of magnitude higher than those estimated till now for future experiments .",
    "however , the bound on @xmath96 is very poor , which is expected to improve in an analysis with solar neutrino data .",
    "it can be understood that @xmath3 and @xmath0 violation effect can be very cleanly discriminated in atmospheric neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 and @xmath95 appears dominantly neither in atmospheric neutrino oscillation nor in solar neutrino oscillation , but appears as subleading in both cases .",
    "these are observable in range of @xmath114 gev for atmospheric neutrino , where solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations couple .",
    "see fig . 1 and 2 in ref .",
    "it has also been shown in fig . 7 in ref .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath115 gev , the sensitivity to @xmath3 phase is very negligible .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath7 comes from the sensitivity of @xmath35 of the experiment . from our previous work @xcite , it can be understood that sensitivity to @xmath35 will not be lost significantly if one consider events with @xmath115 gev .",
    "so , @xmath116 gev can be considered roughly the boundary line for @xmath3 and @xmath0 violation studies with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the nonstandard interactions may mimic as a signature of @xmath0 violation .",
    "however , this can also be separated out to an extent using atmospheric neutrino oscillation at a magnetized detector . in case of nonstandard interactions ,",
    "its contribution comes through matter resonance which occurs for some particular zones in @xmath117 plane of neutrinos with normal hierarchy and for antineutrinos with inverted hierarchy .",
    "these zones does not move significantly with the change of oscillation parameters for their present ranges of the uncertainties . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath7 effect comes over whole @xmath117 plane .",
    "so , again separating the resonance zones , one can separate out the @xmath0 violation from nonstandard interactions .",
    "the separation of @xmath3 violation , @xmath0 violation and nonstandard interactions can be done for atmospheric neutrinos since it covers wide ranges of @xmath55 and @xmath10 and contains both neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this is a major advantage of atmospheric neutrino experiment with a magnetized detector over neutrino beams .",
    "we have studied @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillation in a full three flavor framework with matter effect constructing a new way to find the oscillation probability so that @xmath0 violating terms are incorporated in the oscillation probability formula without any approximation .",
    "we carried out this study with atmospheric neutrinos for a magnetized iron calorimeter detector considering the muons ( directly measurable with high resolution ) of the charge current events .",
    "we have shown that a stringent bound of @xmath2 gev at 99% cl can be obtained at a magnetized ical detector with 1 mton.year exposure , which is much stronger , almost one order of magnitude higher than those estimated till now for future detectors .",
    "the advantages of atmospheric neutrinos to discriminate the effect of @xmath0 violation , @xmath3 violation and nonstandard interactions are also discussed .    _",

    "<S> we have studied @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillation considering three flavor framework with matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a new way to find the oscillation probability incorporating @xmath0 violating terms without any approximation . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath0 violation with atmospheric neutrinos for a magnetized iron calorimeter detector considering the muons ( directly measurable with high resolution ) of the charge current events has been studied for zero and nonzero @xmath1 values . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a potential bound of @xmath2 gev at 99% cl can be obtained with 1 mton.year exposure of this detector ; and unlike neutrino beam experiments , there is no possibility to generate ` fake ' @xmath0 violation due to matter effect with atmospheric neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of atmospheric neutrinos to discriminate @xmath0 violation from @xmath3 violation and nonstandard interactions are also discussed . </S>"
