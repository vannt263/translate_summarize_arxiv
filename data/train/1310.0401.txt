    "the constrained voter model has been originally introduced in @xcite to understand the opinion dynamics in a spatially structured population of leftists , centrists and rightists . as in the popular voter model @xcite , the individuals are located on the vertex set of a graph and",
    "interact through the edges of the graph at a constant rate .",
    "however , in contrast with the classical voter model where , upon interaction , an individual adopts the opinion of her neighbor , it is now assumed that this imitation rule is suppressed when a leftist and a rightist interact . in particular",
    ", the model includes a social factor called homophily that prevents agents who disagree too much to interact .",
    "* model description *  this paper is concerned with a natural generalization of the previous version of the constrained voter model that includes an arbitrary finite number @xmath0 of opinions and a so - called confidence threshold @xmath1 . having a connected graph @xmath3 representing the network of interactions ,",
    "the state at time @xmath4 is a spatial configuration @xmath5 each individual looks at each of her neighbors at rate one that she imitates if and only if the opinion distance between the two neighbors is at most equal to the confidence threshold . formally , the dynamics of the system is described by the markov generator @xmath6 \\end{array}\\ ] ] where configuration @xmath7 is obtained from @xmath8 by setting @xmath9 and where @xmath10 means that the two vertices are connected by an edge .",
    "note that the basic voter model and the original version of the constrained voter model including the three opinions leftist , centrist and rightist can be recovered from our general model as follows : @xmath11 the main question about the constrained voter model is whether the system fluctuates and evolves to a global consensus or fixates in a highly fragmented configuration . to define this dichotomy rigorously",
    ", we say that * fluctuation * occurs whenever @xmath12 and that * fixation * occurs if there exists a configuration @xmath13 such that @xmath14 in other words , fixation means that the opinion of each individual is only updated a finite number of times , therefore fluctuation and fixation exclude each other .",
    "we define convergence to a global consensus mathematically as a * clustering * of the system , i.e. , @xmath15 note that , whenever @xmath16 , the process reduces to the basic voter model with @xmath0 instead of two different opinions for which the long - term behavior of the process is well known : the system on lattices fluctuates while the system on finite connected graphs fixates to a configuration in which all the individuals share the same opinion .",
    "in particular , the main objective of this paper is to study fluctuation and fixation in the nontrivial case when @xmath17 .        * main results *  whether the system fluctuates or fixates depends not only on the two parameters but also on the initial distribution .",
    "in particular , we point out that , throughout the paper , it will be assumed that the initial distribution is the product measure with constant densities . to avoid trivialities , we also assume that the initial density of each of the opinions is positive : @xmath18 for the constrained voter model on the one - dimensional torus with @xmath19 vertices , the mean - field analysis in @xcite suggests that , in the presence of three opinions and when the threshold is equal to one , the average domain length at equilibrium is @xmath20 ^ 2 \\ \\sim \\ \\frac{2 \\rho_2}{\\pi}\\ ] ] when the initial density of centrists @xmath21 is small and @xmath19 is large .",
    "vzquez et al .",
    "@xcite also showed that these predictions agree with their numerical simulations from which they conclude that , when the initial density of centrists is small , the system fixates with high probability in a frozen mixture of leftists and rightists .",
    "in contrast , it is conjectured in @xcite based on an idea in @xcite that the infinite system fluctuates and clusters whenever @xmath2 , which includes the threshold one model with three opinions introduced in @xcite . to explain this apparent disagreement",
    ", we first observe that , regardless of the parameters , the system on finite graphs always fixate and there is a positive probability that the final configuration consists of a highly fragmented configuration , thus showing that spatial simulations of the necessarily finite system are not symptomatic of the behavior of its infinite counterpart .",
    "our first theorem shows that the conjecture in @xcite is indeed correct .    ",
    "[ th : fluctuation ] assume and @xmath2 . then ,    1 .",
    "the process on @xmath22 fluctuates and clusters . 2 .",
    "the probability of consensus on any finite connected graph satisfies @xmath23    the intuition behind the proof is that , whenever @xmath2 , there is a nonempty set of opinions which are within the confidence threshold of any other opinions .",
    "this simple observation implies the existence of a coupling between the constrained and basic voter models , which is the key to proving fluctuation .",
    "the proof of clustering is more difficult .",
    "it heavily relies on the fact that the system fluctuates but also on an analysis of the interfaces of the process through a coupling with a certain system of charged particles .",
    "in contrast , our lower bound for the probability of consensus on finite connected graphs relies on techniques from martingale theory .",
    "note that this lower bound is in fact equal to the initial density of individuals who are in the confidence threshold of any other individuals in the system .",
    "returning to the relationship between finite and infinite systems , we point out that the simulation pictures of figure [ fig : interface ] , which show two typical realizations of the process on the torus under the assumptions of the theorem , suggest fixation of the infinite counterpart in a highly fragmented configuration , in contradiction with the first part of our theorem , showing again the difficulty to interpret spatial simulations .",
    "note also that , for the system on the one - dimensional torus with @xmath19 vertices , the average domain length at equilibrium is bounded from below by @xmath24 which , together with the second part of the theorem , proves that the average domain length scales like the population size when @xmath2 and that does not hold . while our fluctuation - clustering result holds regardless of the initial densities",
    "provided they are all positive , whether fixation occurs or not seems to be very sensitive to the initial distribution .",
    "also , to state our fixation results and avoid messy calculations later , we strengthen condition and assume that @xmath25 the next theorem looks at the fixation regime in three different contexts .    ",
    "[ th : fixation ] assume .",
    "then , the process on @xmath22 fixates in the following cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 is small enough .",
    "2 .   @xmath0 is large , @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 3 .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the first part of the theorem is the converse of the first part of theorem [ th : fluctuation ] , thus showing that the condition @xmath34 is critical in the sense that    * when @xmath2 , the one - dimensional constrained voter model fluctuates when starting from any nondegenerate distributions whereas * when @xmath26 , the one - dimensional constrained voter model can fixate even when starting from a nondegenerate distribution .",
    "the last two parts of the theorem specialize in two particular cases .",
    "the first one looks at uniform initial distributions in which all the opinions are equally likely . for simplicity ,",
    "our statement focuses on the fixation region when the parameters are large but our proof is not limited to large parameters and implies more generally that the system fixates for all pairs of parameters corresponding to the set of white dots in the phase diagram of figure [ fig : diagram ] for the one - dimensional system with up to twenty opinions .",
    "note that the picture suggests that the process starting from a uniform initial distribution fixates whenever @xmath28 even for a small number of opinions .",
    "the second particular case returns to the slightly more general initial distributions but focuses on the threshold one model with four opinions for which fixation is proved when @xmath21 is only slightly less than one over the number of opinions = 0.25 .",
    "this last result suggests that the constrained voter model with four opinions and threshold one fixates when starting from the uniform product measure , although the calculations become too tedious to indeed obtain fixation when starting from this distribution .",
    "* structure of the paper *  the rest of the article is devoted to the proof of both theorems . even though our proof of fluctuation - clustering and fixation differ significantly , a common technique we introduce to study these two aspects for the one - dimensional process is a coupling with a certain system of charged particles that keeps track of the discrepancies along the edges of the graph rather than the actual opinion at each vertex .",
    "in contrast , our approach to analyze the process on finite connected graphs is to look at the opinion at each vertex and use , among other things , the optimal stopping theorem for martingales .",
    "the coupling with the system of charged particles is introduced in section  [ sec : coupling ] and then used in section  [ sec : fluctuation ] to prove theorem  [ th : fluctuation ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th : fixation ] is more complicated and carried out in the last five sections  [ sec : condition][sec : fixation - particular ] .",
    "in addition to the coupling with the system of charged particles introduced in the next section , the proof relies on a characterization of fixation based on so - called active paths proved in section  [ sec : condition ] and large deviation estimates for the number of changeovers in a sequence of independent coin flips proved in section  [ sec : deviation ] .",
    "to study the one - dimensional system , it is convenient to construct the process from a graphical representation and to introduce a coupling between the process and a certain system of charged particles that keeps track of the discrepancies along the edges of the lattice rather than the opinion at each vertex .",
    "this system of charged particles can also be constructed from the same graphical representation . since the constrained voter model on general finite graphs",
    "will be studied using other techniques , we only define the graphical representation for the process on @xmath22 , which consists of the following collection of independent poisson processes :    * for each @xmath35 , we let @xmath36 be a rate one poisson process , * we denote by @xmath37 its @xmath38th arrival time .    this collection of independent poisson processes is then turned into a percolation structure by drawing an arrow @xmath39 at time @xmath40 and , given a configuration of the one - dimensional system at time @xmath41 , we say that this arrow is * active * if and only if @xmath42 the configuration at time @xmath4 is then obtained by setting @xmath43 an argument due to harris @xcite implies that the constrained voter model starting from any configuration can indeed be constructed using this percolation structure and rule . from the collection of active arrows , we construct active paths as in percolation theory .",
    "more precisely , we say that there is an * active path * from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , and write @xmath46 , whenever there exist @xmath47 such that the following two conditions hold :    1 .   for @xmath48 , there is an active arrow from @xmath49 to @xmath50 at time @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath52",
    ", there is no active arrow that points at @xmath53 .",
    "note that conditions 1 and 2 above imply that @xmath54 moreover , because of the definition of active arrows , the opinion of vertex @xmath55 at time @xmath4 originates and is therefore equal to the initial opinion of vertex @xmath56 so we call vertex @xmath56 the * ancestor * of vertex @xmath55 at time @xmath4",
    ". one of the key ingredients to studying the one - dimensional system is to look at the following process defined on the edges : identifying each edge with its midpoint , we set @xmath57 and think of edge @xmath58 as being    * empty whenever @xmath59 , * occupied by a pile of @xmath60 particles with positive charge whenever @xmath61 , * occupied by a pile of @xmath60 particles with negative charge whenever @xmath62 .",
    "the dynamics of the constrained voter model induces evolution rules which are again markov on this system of charged particles .",
    "assume that there is an arrow @xmath63 at time @xmath4 and @xmath64 indicating in particular that there is a pile of @xmath60 particles with positive charge at @xmath65 .",
    "then , we have the following alternative :    * there is no particle at edge @xmath66 or equivalently @xmath67 in which case the individuals at vertices @xmath55 and @xmath68 already agree so nothing happens .",
    "* there is a pile of @xmath69 particles at edge @xmath66 in which case @xmath55 and @xmath68 disagree too much to interact so nothing happens .",
    "* there is a pile of @xmath70 particles at @xmath66 in which case @xmath71 in particular , there is no more particles at edge @xmath66 and a pile of @xmath72 particles all with the common charge @xmath73 at edge @xmath74 .",
    "similar evolution rules are obtained by exchanging the direction of the interaction or by assuming that we have @xmath75 from which we can deduce the following description :    * piles with more than @xmath1 particles can not move therefore we call such piles * blockades * and the particles they contain * frozen * particles .",
    "* piles with at most @xmath1 particles jump one step to the left or one step to the right at the same rate one therefore we call the particles they contain * active * particles . * when a pile with positive / negative particles jumps onto a pile with negative / positive particles , positive and negative particles *",
    "annihilate * by pair which results in a smaller pile of particles all with the same charge .",
    "we refer to figure [ fig : particles ] for an illustration of these evolution rules .",
    "note that whether an arrow is active or not can also be characterized from the state of the edge process : @xmath76 in particular , active arrows correspond to active piles of particles .",
    "the key ingredient to proving fluctuation of the one - dimensional system and estimating the probability of consensus on finite connected graphs is to partition the opinion set into two sets that we shall call the set of * centrist * opinions and the set of * extremist * opinions : @xmath77 note that the assumption @xmath2 implies that the set of centrist opinions is nonempty .",
    "note also that both sets are characterized by the properties @xmath78 as shown in figure [ fig : partition ] which gives a schematic illustration of the partition .",
    "fluctuation is proved in the next lemma using this partition and relying on a coupling with the voter model .    ",
    "[ lem : fluctuation ] the process on @xmath22 fluctuates whenever @xmath2 and @xmath79 .",
    "it follows from that centrist agents are within the confidence threshold of every other individual .",
    "in particular , for each pair @xmath80 we have the transition rates @xmath81 and similarly @xmath82 now , we introduce the process @xmath83 since for all @xmath84 the transition rates @xmath85 are constant over all @xmath86 according to , we have the following local transition rate for this new process : @xmath87 using in place of and some obvious symmetry , we also have @xmath88 this shows that the spin system @xmath89 reduces to the voter model",
    ". in particular , the lemma directly follows from the fact that the one - dimensional voter model itself , when starting with a positive density of each type , fluctuates , a result proved based on duality in @xcite , pp 868869 .    ",
    "[ lem : cluster ] the process on @xmath22 clusters whenever @xmath2 and @xmath79 .",
    "the proof strongly relies on the coupling with the voter model in the proof of the previous lemma . to begin with",
    ", we define the function @xmath90 which , in view of translation invariance of the initial configuration and the evolution rules , does not depend on the choice of @xmath58 . note that , since the system of charged particles coupled with the process involves deaths of particles but no births , the function @xmath91 is nonincreasing in time , therefore it has a limit : @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",
    "now , on the event that an edge @xmath58 is occupied by a pile of at least one particle at a given time @xmath4 , we have the following alternative :    * @xmath65 is a blockade . in this case , since the centrist agents are within the confidence threshold of all the other agents , we must have @xmath94 but since the voter model @xmath89 fluctuates , @xmath95 in particular , at least of one of the frozen particles at @xmath58 is killed eventually .",
    "* @xmath65 is a live edge . in this case , since one - dimensional symmetric random walks are recurrent , the active pile of particles at @xmath58 eventually intersects another pile of particles , and we have the following alternative : * * the two intersecting piles of particles have opposite charge , which results in the simultaneous death of at least two particles . *",
    "* the two intersecting piles have the same charge and merge to form a blockade in which case we are back to the previous case : since the voter model @xmath89 fluctuates , at least one of the frozen particles in this blockade is killed eventually . *",
    "* the two intersecting piles have the same charge and merge to form a larger active pile in which case the pile keeps moving until , after a finite number of collisions , we are back to one of the previous two possibilities : at least two active particles annihilate or there is creation of a blockade with at least one particle that is killed eventually .    in either case , as long as there are particles , there are also annihilating events indicating that the density of particles @xmath91 is strictly decreasing as long as it is positive .",
    "in particular , the density of particles decreases to zero so there is extinction of both the active and frozen particles : @xmath96 in particular , for all @xmath97 with @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 which proves clustering .     +   + the second part of the theorem , which gives a lower bound for the probability of consensus of the process on finite connected graphs , relies on very different techniques , namely techniques related to martingale theory following an idea from @xcite , section 3 . however , the partition of the opinion set into centrist opinions and extremist opinions is again a key to the proof .    ",
    "[ lem : consensus ] for the process on any finite connected graph , @xmath100    the first step is to prove that the process that keeps track of the number of supporters of any given opinion is a martingale .",
    "then , applying the martingale convergence theorem and optimal stopping theorem , we obtain a lower bound for the probability of extinction of the extremist agents , which is also a lower bound for the probability of consensus . for @xmath101 , we set @xmath102 and we observe that @xmath103 letting @xmath104 denote the natural filtration of the process , we also have @xmath105 indicating that the process @xmath106 is a martingale with respect to the natural filtration of the constrained voter model .",
    "this , together with , implies that @xmath107 also is a martingale .",
    "it is also bounded because of the finiteness of the graph therefore , according to the martingale convergence theorem , there is almost sure convergence to a certain random variable : @xmath108 and we claim that @xmath109 can only take two values : @xmath110 to prove our claim , we note that , invoking again the finiteness of the graph , the process gets trapped in an absorbing state after an almost surely stopping time so we have @xmath111 assuming by contradiction that @xmath112 gives an absorbing state with at least one centrist agent and at least one extremist agent . since the graph is connected , this implies the existence of an edge @xmath113 such that @xmath114 but then we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 showing that @xmath117 is not an absorbing state , in contradiction with the definition of time @xmath118 .",
    "this proves that our claim is true .",
    "now , applying the optimal stopping theorem to the bounded martingale @xmath107 and the almost surely finite stopping time @xmath118 and using , we obtain @xmath119 from which it follows that @xmath120 to conclude , we observe that , on the event that @xmath121 , all the opinions present in the system after the hitting time @xmath118 are within distance @xmath1 of each other therefore the process evolves according to a voter model after that time . since the only absorbing states of the voter model on finite connected graphs are the configurations in which all the agents share the same opinion , we deduce that the system converges to a consensus .",
    "this , together with , implies that @xmath122 this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "the main objective of this section is to prove a sufficient condition for fixation of the constrained voter model based on certain properties of the active paths .    ",
    "[ lem : fixation - condition ] for all @xmath123 , let @xmath124 then , the constrained voter model fixates whenever @xmath125    this is similar to the proof of lemma 2 in @xcite and lemma 4 in @xcite . to begin with ,",
    "we define recursively a sequence of stopping times by setting @xmath126 in other words , the @xmath60th stopping time @xmath127 is the @xmath60th time the individual at the origin changes her opinion .",
    "now , we define the following random variables and collection of events : @xmath128 the assumption together with reflection symmetry implies that the event @xmath129 occurs almost surely for some positive integer @xmath130 , which implies that @xmath131 since @xmath132 is the event that the individual at the origin changes her opinion infinitely often , in view of the previous inequality , in order to establish fixation , it suffices to prove that @xmath133 to prove equations , we let @xmath134 be the set of descendants of @xmath55 at time @xmath4 which , due to one - dimensional nearest neighbor interactions , is necessarily an interval and its cardinality , respectively . now , since each interaction between two individuals is equally likely to affect the opinion of each of these two individuals , the number of descendants of any given site is a martingale whose expected value is constantly equal to one .",
    "in particular , the martingale convergence theorem implies that @xmath135 therefore the number of descendants of @xmath55 converges to a finite value .",
    "since in addition the number of descendants is an integer - valued process , @xmath136 which further implies that , with probability one , @xmath137 finally , we note that , on the event @xmath129 , the last time the individual at the origin changes her opinion is at most equal to the largest of the stopping times @xmath138 for @xmath139 therefore @xmath140 according to .",
    "this proves and the lemma .",
    "in order to find later a good upper bound for the probability in and deduce a sufficient condition for fixation of the process , the next step is to prove large deviation estimates for the number of piles with @xmath60  particles with a given charge in a large interval . more precisely , the main objective of this section is to prove that for all @xmath60 and all @xmath141 the probability that @xmath142 decays exponentially with @xmath130 . note that , even though the initial opinions are chosen independently , the states at different edges are not independent .",
    "for instance , a pile of particles with a positive charge is more likely to be surrounded by negative particles .",

    "the expected value of the number of changeovers @xmath145 before time @xmath130 can be easily computed by observing that @xmath146 and by using the linearity of the expected value : @xmath147 then , we have the following large deviation estimates for the number of changeovers .    ",
