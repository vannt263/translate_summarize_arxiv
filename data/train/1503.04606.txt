    "lowered excitation energies of the first 1@xmath9 states , fast e1 transitions between the k@xmath10 and ground state bands and high @xmath11 values observed in the even - even @xmath12nd isotopes constitute an evidence that these nuclei belong to the octupole deformation region in lanthanides .",
    "also theory assigns these isotopes to the octupole region @xcite .",
    "this same one should expect for the odd - n neodymium isotopes from this mass region . in these isotopes",

    "@xcite in which the properties of @xmath13nd isotope have been studied we have obtained very low @xmath11 values for the lowest pair of opposite parity states which should constitute parity doublet in this isotope . in the present work we have undertaken investigations of octupole correlations in @xmath0nd .",
    "excited states in @xmath0nd have been previously studied in the @xmath3-decay of @xmath0pr @xcite , in the neutron capture reaction @xcite and in the transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "recently , high - spin states in @xmath0nd have been studied with the use of the heavy ion induced fusion - fission reaction @xcite .",

    "lifetimes of the lowest levels in @xmath0nd have been measured in refs .",
    "experimental data concerning the @xmath0nd nucleus are gathered in a recent compilation @xcite . despite of a rather big body of experimental data on @xmath0nd no firm configuration assignment for excited levels",
    "was proposed and there is no experimental information on octupole correlations in @xmath0nd . in order to obtain a better understanding of the low energy structure and to get information on octupole strength in of @xmath0nd we have measured lifetimes of the excited states in this nucleus using the advanced time - delayed @xmath14 method @xcite .",
    "the experimental methods are briefly described in section [ sec : method ] , while a new level scheme for @xmath0nd and the lifetime results are presented in section [ sec : results ] of this paper . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "experimental results are discussed and results of theoretical calculations are presented . in particular ,",
    "results of potential energy calculations on the ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) plane and theoretical values of @xmath11 moments are shown .",
    "measurements were carried out at the osiris on - line fission - product mass separator at studsvik in sweden @xcite .",
    "excited states in @xmath0nd were populated in the @xmath3-decay of @xmath0pr , which was obtained via a chain of @xmath3-decays starting from the @xmath0cs and @xmath0ba isotopes ,    @xmath15 @xmath16    the a=147 nuclei were produced in the fission reaction of @xmath17u induced by the thermal neutrons from the r2 - 0 reactor at studsvik . the @xmath17u target consisted of about 1 g of uranium dispersed in graphite .",
    "the a=147 activity , mass separated from other fission products , was deposited onto an aluminized mylar foil in a moving - tape collection system at the center of the experimental setup .",
    "each measuring cycle was divided into eight sequential time - bins , each lasting 40 s. to clean up spectra from the activities coming from the @xmath0pr predecessors our radioactive samples were cumulated during first 135 s of each cycle . then the beam was deflected and the data were collected during the rest of the cycle .",
    "two experiments have been performed . in the first one the multispectra ( mss ) and @xmath3-gated @xmath1 coincidence data",
    "have been collected . in this experiment one lep ge detector with energy resolution fwhm of 0.6 kev at 81 kev , one 30% hpge detector with fwhm of 2.1 kev and one 80% hpge detector with fwhm of 2.9 kev at 1333 kev have been used .",

    "the fast timing information was derived from coincidences between fast - response @xmath3- and baf@xmath21 @xmath2-detectors , while an additional coincidence with a ge @xmath2-detector was used to select the desired @xmath2-cascade . in this experiment",
    "the setup consisted of one baf@xmath21 detector , one hpge detector with efficiency of 30% and fwhm of 2.1 kev at 1333 kev , and one @xmath3-detector .",
    "the latter was a 3 mm thick @xmath22e ne111a plastic detector to ensure almost constant , independent of the @xmath3-particle energy , time response of the fast timing system .",
    "about 2.2@xmath1810@xmath23 @xmath3-ge - baf@xmath21(t ) coincident events have been collected .",
    "several sets of the @xmath3-gated coincidence @xmath2-ray spectra from the ge and baf@xmath21 detectors and triple coincidence @xmath4(t ) time - delayed spectra have been sorted in the off - line analysis . gating conditions set on the @xmath3-spectrum",

    "the @xmath11 moments calculated from the b(e1)/b(e2 ) values given in this reference are 0.18(1 ) and 0.21(2 ) @xmath24 for the 31/2@xmath9 , 2703.1 kev and 35/2@xmath9 , 3264.0 kev levels , respectively .",

    "it seems that considered opposite parity states in @xmath27nd and in @xmath13ce may not constitute parity doublets and the main octupole strength is located at higher excitation energies .",
    "it is possible that the presence of odd neutron blocks octupole correlations at low excitation energies in the odd n isotopes . more experimental information on the parity doublets and dipole moments in @xmath0nd and in other odd n isotopes in lanthanides is needed to understand the @xmath11 moments behavior in nuclei from this region .",
    "energy surfaces over ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) plane were calculated for the lowest single - particle configurations in @xmath0nd by using the macroscopic - microscopic method .",
    "macroscopic energy was calculated using the yukawa plus exponential model @xcite with parameters specified in @xcite .",
    "a deformed woods - saxon potential potential @xcite with the universal set of parameters @xcite was used to calculate the microscopic energy .",
    "we used a @xmath3 parametrization , @xmath3 = ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) , in which the shape of a nucleus is described by the formula : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the nuclear radius and @xmath34 is the volume - fixing factor .    considered single particle configurations were chosen by blocking the odd neutron on a desired single particle state with a given @xmath35 .",
    "energies were calculated on a grid of 1361367 points defined by deformation values :    @xmath36    where the step in each deformation is given in parenthesis .",
    "for each pair ( @xmath37 ) energy was then minimized with respect to @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "energy surfaces obtained for four single - particle configurations in @xmath0nd are presented in fig .",

    "two configurations , @xmath42 and 3/2 ( energy levels no .",
    "42 and 43 ) with shallow octupole minima may be called octupole - soft .",
    "slightly more pronounced , @xmath43 mev deep , octupole minima were obtained for configurations with @xmath42 and 5/2 ( levels no 44 and 45 ; the fermi level in @xmath0nd lies in - between levels no 43 and 44 ) .",
    "energy calculations for two even - a neighbors of @xmath0nd show octupole minima for both @xmath25nd and @xmath26nd ground states .",
    "thus , our calculations suggest that @xmath0nd lies inside the lanthanide octupole collective region .",

    "band can be calculated assuming the fixed structure of both the phonon and the collective rotor @xcite . for an operator @xmath44 of the multipolarity @xmath45",

    "is calculated as the intrinsic dipole moment at this deformation of equilibrium . in this case ,",
    "@xmath52 , the expectation value of @xmath29 in the first excited state of negative parity , nearly degenerate with the g.s .    for shallow minima , closer to oscillation scenario , the degeneracy between parity - doublet bands is shifted . the transition matrix element in the intrinsic frame between the g.s . and the lowest excited state of negative parity @xmath53 may be approximated by a diagonal matrix element of the transition operator in the mean - field state with the deformations @xmath54 fixed as the most probable by the transition density . for a harmonic lowest - lying phonon one has the relation @xmath55 which follows from the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "we calculated expectation values of the electric dipole moment in the intrinsic states as a sum of the macroscopic and shell - correction parts , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic part , derived within the droplet model in @xcite , was calculated as in @xcite , i.e. without assuming small deformations @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out ( table [ tab : d0 ] ) that intrinsic dipole moments at equilibrium deformations for two configurations : @xmath42 and 3/2 ( levels no 43 and 44 ) interpolate the values for @xmath57nd .",
    "both macroscopic and shell correction contributions have the same sign , so no reduction of @xmath58 due to their cancellation is possible",
    ". thus , the dipole moments inferred from experiment do not fit the picture of parity doublet bands .",
    "the advanced time - delayed @xmath59(t ) method has been used to measure half - lives of 8 excited states in @xmath0nd .",
    "reduced transition probabilities were obtained for 30 transitions .",
    "twenty - four new @xmath2-lines and 3 new levels have been introduced into the decay scheme of @xmath0nd based on the results of the @xmath3-gated @xmath1 coincidence measurement .",
    "the potential energy surfaces on the ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) plane and theoretical @xmath11 values suggest the presence of octupole deformation in @xmath0nd at low excitation energies for two configurations with k=1/2 and k=5/2 .",
    "this suggestion is supported by high experimental @xmath11 values in two even - even neighbors of @xmath0nd . for the k=1/2 configuration",
    "we were able to determine only lower limit of the dipole moment , @xmath70.02 e@xmath8 .",
    "however non - observation of the k=5/2 parity doublet band may suggest that in @xmath0nd the @xmath11 values are as low as observed in other odd n isotopes at low excitation energies .",
    "probably strong octupole correlations should be searched at higher excitation energies in the odd n isotopes from the lanthanides octupole region .",
