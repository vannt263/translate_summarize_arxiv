    "the proton weak capture on protons is the most fundamental process in stellar nucleosynthesis : it is the first reaction in the @xmath5 chain converting hydrogen into helium , and the principal source for the production of energy and neutrinos in main - sequence stars . the theoretical description of this hydrogen - burning reaction",
    ", whose cross section can not be measured in terrestrial laboratories , was first given by bethe and critchfield  @xcite , who showed that the associated rate was large enough to account for the energy released by the sun .",
    "since then , a series of calculations has refined their original estimate by either computing the required wave functions more accurately  @xcite or by using more realistic models for the nuclear transition operator  @xcite .",
    "we here contribute to this effort by providing an integrated study of these two aspects with emphasis on a reliable estimate of their associated theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this paper is divided into seven sections and an appendix . in sec .",
    "ii we set up the framework for the present study , by providing expressions for the @xmath5 fusion cross section and the required matrix elements and by summarizing the current `` best '' values for the various coupling constants , fermi function , etc . in secs .",
    "iii and iv we give a fairly detailed description of , respectively , the @xmath5 and deuteron wave functions , as obtained from modern ( high - precision ) interactions .",
    "the latter include , along with the short - range nuclear part , a complete treatment of electromagnetic effects up to order @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the fine - structure constant , and accurately reproduce the measured low - energy @xmath5 scattering parameters and deuteron properties .",
    "sections  v and vi deal with the calculation of the @xmath5 cross section in the approximations , respectively , in which only the one - body or both the one- and two - body parts of the axial current operator are retained . in sec .",
    "vi we also review the evidence , as obtained from an analysis of tritium @xmath4 decay , for the axial two - body components ( explicit expressions for them are listed in the appendix ) . because of their model dependence , we adopt the phenomenological approach of adjusting the cutoff masses in the meson - nucleon vertices and @xmath9 to @xmath10 axial coupling constant so as to obtain agreement with the experimental value for the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath4 decay .",
    "the question of how this procedure impacts the @xmath5 cross section is also examined . finally , in sec .",

    "the vacuum polarization integral is given by  @xcite @xmath114 with @xmath115 mev the electron mass .",
    "including the finite - size effect , we get the more complicated expression as given by bohannon and heller  @xcite , where the exponential is replaced by @xmath116e^{-\\rho } ,               \\label{ivpff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 , @xmath118^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath119 @xmath120 . as a matter of fact , the simple multiplication of eq .",

    "@xcite ) already closely resembles the exact treatment ( [ ivpff ] ) where the finite - size effect is properly folded into the integral .",
    "the magnetic moment interaction @xmath121 arises as a consequence of the nonvanishing value of the proton magnetic moment , @xmath122 , while the darwin - foldy term @xmath123 is a short - range potential , describing the finite size of the proton , where @xmath124 in the limit of point protons .",
    "now that we have defined the full long - range electromagnetic interaction , we can return to the question of how , in practice , to integrate the schrdinger equation and extract the phase shift .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to @xmath34 waves , and so the tensor and spin - orbit terms in the magnetic moment interaction vanish .",
    "it is convenient to define a phase shift @xmath125 , which is the phase shift of the solution of the potential @xmath126 with respect to the solution with the potential @xmath127 as the interaction .",
    "the well - known application of this procedure is the situation where @xmath127 is the coulomb potential and @xmath126 is the coulomb plus nuclear potential , and the phase shift @xmath128 is obtained by matching the numerical solution to coulomb wave functions as in eq .",
    "( [ chib ] ) .",
    "if we are to include @xmath110 in @xmath126 , we run into the problem that we have to integrate out to infinitely large distances before we can match to coulomb functions .",

    "the advantage is clear immediately : we only have to integrate out to distances large with respect to the nuclear interaction , which is only about 20 fm .",
    "but we have to bear in mind that now the phase shift is @xmath134 , where it should be understood implicitly that the superscript refers to the interactions in the point - nucleon limit , while the interaction denoted by the subscript includes also the ( short - range ) finite - size effects . to make this clear explicitly , we have here separated off the finite - size effects by writing them symbolically as being due to some short - range potential @xmath135 . in this notation , the phase shift with respect to coulomb functions , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , now reads @xmath136 where @xmath137 can be easily expressed in terms of the standard coulomb phase shift @xmath138 as @xmath139    the next step is to also include the vacuum polarization .",
    "the case where we only have the coulomb and vacuum polarization has been discussed in detail by durand  @xcite and heller  @xcite , who derive expressions for the relevant asymptotic wave functions and vacuum polarization phase shift @xmath140 .",
    "although the vacuum polarization potential exhibits an exponential falloff , the small value of the electron mass means that the schrdinger equation has to be integrated out to several hundred fermi before the potential has dropped to sufficiently small values , and it is only then that the numerical solution can be properly matched to the asymptotic solution .",
    "the presence of @xmath110 considerably worsens the situation .",
    "since the @xmath111 behavior of @xmath110 is of longer range than the exponential decay of @xmath112 , the schrdinger equation has to be integrated out to distances where @xmath112 is negligibly small as compared to @xmath110 .",
    "it is only then that we can match the numerical solution to the proper asymptotic solution and define the phase shift .",
    "unfortunately , because of the slow falloff of the vacuum polarization and the small magnitude of the two - photon - exchange contribution , we now have to integrate out to much larger distances . even at a distance of 2000",
    "fm the vacuum polarization has only dropped to about 1% of the two - photon exchange .",
    "the scenario of getting the @xmath5 wave function for a particular nuclear interaction @xmath87 in the @xmath34 wave in the presence of the full electromagnetic interaction @xmath86 is now as follows .",
    "we integrate the schrdinger equation out to a distance of 3000 fm , where the numerical solution is matched to the electromagnetic wave functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the latter are defined to be the solutions of the schrdinger equation in the presence of the point - nucleon @xmath143 interaction .",
    "this procedure , therefore , determines the phase shift @xmath144 of the nuclear plus full electromagnetic interaction with respect to the point - nucleon @xmath143 interaction .",
    "it should be stressed that this phase shift is _ not _ the same as the phase shift of the nuclear interaction in the presence of only the coulomb interaction ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the relation between these electromagnetic wave functions and the standard coulomb wave functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 with @xmath149 and @xmath150 the two - photon - exchange and vacuum polarization @xmath34-wave phase shifts , respectively .",
    "the prime in the vacuum polarization is to indicate that this is the vacuum polarization phase shift _ in the presence of @xmath110 _ , which is slightly different from what is defined in refs .",
    "note that the numerical wave function is now properly normalized as in eq .",
    "( [ chib ] ) , since @xmath151 .",
    "it should be pointed out that at extreme low energies ( a few kev ) , @xmath144 is almost zero , @xmath149 is of the order of a few times @xmath152 deg , whereas @xmath150 rapidly drops from about @xmath153 deg at 10 kev to @xmath154 deg at 2 kev , and so @xmath90 exhibits a change of sign and goes through zero as a function of energy .",

    "the normalization ( [ chib ] ) advocated here allows for an immediate substitution of the numerical wave function ( as obtained from solving the schrdinger equation ) into the expression for @xmath158 as defined by salpeter  @xcite , without having to worry about a phase shift which goes through zero at these extreme low energies and without having to define a complicated effective - range function .",

    "however , corrections to eq .",
    "( [ ppp ] ) appear to be very small , a few parts in a thousand .",
    "third , the results listed in table  [ tabgt ] indicate that modern interactions lead to predictions for the gt matrix element of tritium in the range @xmath306 , and therefore to an underestimate of the experimental value ranging , in relative terms , from 2.1% for cd - bonn / tm to 3.7% for av18/uix .      for the axial two - body current operator we use a slightly expanded version of the conventional @xmath307- and @xmath308-meson exchange model first described by chemtob and rho  @xcite .",
    "these are two - body currents associated with excitation of intermediate @xmath10 resonances by @xmath307 and @xmath308 exchanges , the @xmath309 mechanism , and the contact @xmath310 and @xmath311 interactions . in the tables , these operators are denoted , respectively , as @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath309 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315 .",

    "[ tabgt2 ] we quote the contributions to the gt matrix element obtained with the chh av18/uix trinucleon wave functions from the individual components of the axial current operators listed in the appendix .",

    "@xcite ) and , presumably to a lesser extent , to the fact the older calculations were based on a different hamiltonian model , consisting of the argonne @xmath291 two - nucleon and urbana - viii three - nucleon interactions , which , however , did reproduce the experimental binding energies of the trinucleons in a 34-channel faddeev calculation  @xcite .",
    "the cumulative value for the calculated gt matrix element is @xmath325 , about 0.7% larger than experiment .",
    "a slight adjustment in the cutoff masses @xmath316 and @xmath317 or @xmath326 axial coupling ( or both ) is thus required to bring theory and experiment into perfect agreement .",
    "we will return to this point later , in sec .",
    "vii .    to test the model dependence ,",
    "we have calculated the leading @xmath327 contribution with 42-channel faddeev wave functions obtained from the hamiltonian models discussed earlier , and the results are listed in table  [ tabgt ] . both the one - body and @xmath327 contributions show a strong correlation with the @xmath62-state probability in the trinucleon wave functions , which is obviously related to the deuteron @xmath62-state probability predicted by the underlying two - nucleon interaction , as is evident from tables  [ tabdeutpam ] and  [ tabpro ] .",
    "this correlation is a direct consequence of the dominant contributions due to @xmath328 @xmath329 @xmath160-@xmath161 ( @xmath330 @xmath161 ) transitions for the one - body ( @xmath327 ) component .",
    "this has been verified explicitly by including only the above channels in the faddeev evaluation of the gt matrix element . as a result",
    ", the sum of the one - body and @xmath312 contributions turns out to be essentially model independent , as indicated in table  [ tabgt ] .",
    "such a conclusion is also expected to hold when the remaining two - body contributions are included .",
    "thus , to reproduce the experimental gt matrix element , a single adjustment of the cutoff masses @xmath316 and @xmath317 or @xmath331 in the axial two - body current operators should suffice for all hamiltonian models considered .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath5 capture .",
    "we only quote results , presented in table  [ tablpp ] , corresponding to the av18 and cd - bonn interactions .",
    "the values calculated with these two models , which give the two extremes for the one - body contribution , 6.966 and 6.992 , respectively , at zero energy , are within less than 0.2% when all two - body current contributions are included .",
    "thus , the two - body part of the axial current leads to an increase of the av18 and cd - bonn one - body results , amounting , respectively , to 1.6% and 1.1% , consistently with the findings of the earlier study  @xcite .",
    "having demonstrated the model independence of theoretical predictions for the gt matrix element and @xmath5 weak capture cross section , we now want to address the issue of how ambiguities in the axial two - body currents might affect this conclusion . to this end , it is useful to decompose the gt matrix element as @xmath332 where @xmath333 is the @xmath334 component of any axial two - body current operator , and @xmath335 are projection operators over @xmath330 and 1 two - nucleon states : @xmath336 @xmath337 in eq .",
    "( [ gt01 ] ) most of the @xmath330 ( @xmath328 ) contribution is coming from conversion of a @xmath338 @xmath339 ( @xmath340 @xmath341 ) pair in @xmath267h to a @xmath5 @xmath341 ( @xmath338 @xmath339 ) pair in @xmath267he , for example , @xmath342 since the numbers of @xmath343 and @xmath344 pairs in the trinucleons are much smaller than those with @xmath339 and @xmath341  @xcite .",
    "it is now easy to see that , if ( neglecting isospin - symmetry breaking corrections ) @xmath345 , where @xmath346 is the isospin - flip operator , then @xmath347 since the matrix element is real , @xmath348 commutes with @xmath349 , @xmath350 , and @xmath351 .",
    "thus , the @xmath330 and @xmath328 contributions in eq .",

    "this scaling is to be expected , since it is a consequence of the `` scaling '' behavior more generally observed for the calculated @xmath339 and @xmath341 pair distribution functions in nuclei  @xcite ; see figs .",
    "[ figrho10 ] and  [ figrho01 ] .",

    "( [ p00 ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath5 densities have been rescaled by a factor @xmath362 obtained by matching the maximum of the av18 gt and @xmath5 densities .",
    "however , this rescaling also makes the cd - bonn gt and @xmath5 densities very close ( see fig .  [ figab ] ) , demonstrating that the @xmath356 factor has only a very weak model dependence .",
    "the discussion above shows that two - body contributions to the @xmath5 capture are essentially independent of the specific dynamical model adopted as long as the latter is constrained to reproduce the experimental value of the gt matrix element .",
    "we have calculated the axial matrix element for proton - proton weak capture using five modern high - precision nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "all these models give excellent fits to elastic @xmath162 scattering data with a @xmath363datum near 1 and reproduce measured deuteron properties very well .",
    "we have paid particular attention to details of the electromagnetic interaction and the proper treatment of the low - energy @xmath5 scattering solutions . as noted before  @xcite ,",
    "the most important correction to the standard coulomb interaction between protons is the vacuum polarization , which reduces the cross section by about 1% .",
    "we have shown that other fine details of the electromagnetic interaction increase the cross section by about 0.1% .",
    "this is in part compensated by the correct relativistic treatment of the deuteron wave number @xmath185 , which gives a net 0.03% reduction in the cross section . including just the axial one - body operator , the five models differ by only 0.3% in the calculated cross section .",
    "the biggest remaining uncertainty is in the contribution of axial two - body currents , which can increase the cross section by about 11.5% .",
    "three concerns were expressed at the recent workshop on solar fusion rates  @xcite regarding the use of the known tritium @xmath4-decay rate to predict the axial two - body current contribution to the @xmath5 fusion reaction : ( 1 ) the model dependence of the one - body contribution to the gt matrix element and the resulting uncertainty in the extracted two - body current contribution to that matrix element ; ( 2 ) two - body currents coupling @xmath364 pairs to @xmath365 pairs , which can contribute to the tritium gt matrix element but not to the @xmath5 capture ; and ( 3 ) isobar and contact terms could give different contributions to the gt and @xmath5-capture matrix elements , and thus knowledge of their sum in the gt may not be sufficient to predict their sum in the capture matrix element .",
    "our detailed calculations show that these concerns do not influence the prediction of the @xmath5-capture rate .",
    "in particular , ( 1 ) the model dependence in the one - body contribution to the gt matrix element comes mostly from that in the @xmath62-state probabilities . because of the smaller @xmath62 state predicted by the cd - bonn potential ( table  [ tabpro ] ) , the corresponding prediction for this contribution is larger by about 1% ( table  [ tabgt ] ) .",
    "however , the prediction obtained with this potential for the @xmath5-capture rate via one - body currents is also larger by about 0.3% ( table  [ tablamvnn ] ) because of the smaller @xmath62 state in the deuteron ( table  [ tabdeutpam ] ) .",
    "the axial two - body currents are necessarily weaker in the cd - bonn model because they strongly couple the @xmath34 and @xmath62 states .",
    "in fact , the sum of one- and two - body current contributions is much less model dependent than either as can be seen from tables  [ tabgt ] and  [ tablpp ] .",
    "( 2 ) the axial two - body currents do not couple the @xmath364 pairs to the @xmath365 pairs in any significant way , as the discussion in the preceding section makes clear .",
    "( 3 ) the two - body currents are large at small interparticle distances where nuclear forces dominate over binding energies . in this region",
    "the pair wave functions in different nuclei are similar in shape and differ only by a scale factor .",
    "this is the basis of the bethe - levinger conjecture  @xcite , which can be used to relate processes such as pion and photon absorption , involving nucleon pairs , in different nuclei  @xcite .",
    "thus the ratios of gt and @xmath5-capture matrix elements of different two - body current terms are nearly the same as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figrho ] .",
    "therefore , knowledge of their sum in the gt matrix element is sufficient to predict their sum in the @xmath5-capture matrix element .    finally , as we have already mentioned , the gt matrix element is slightly overpredicted [ @xmath366 versus the experimental value @xmath367 . reducing the quark - model prediction for the @xmath9 to @xmath10 axial coupling in the @xmath327 and @xmath368 currents by 20% brings theory and experiment into agreement .",
    "the resulting cd - bonn and av18 values for the square of the @xmath5 overlap integral at zero energy are then found to be 7.045 and 7.059 , respectively .",
    "predictions for this quantity with other modern interactions are expected to fall in this range .",
