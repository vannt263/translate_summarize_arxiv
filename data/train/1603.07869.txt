    "compact object mergers are strong sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) and are prime targets for the advanced ligo / virgo detectors @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) arise from mergers in which one of the compact objects is a neutron star @xcite , a scenario now favored by a broad range of observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the absence of gw detection ,",
    "a clear signature for the compact - binary origin of a sgrb is a li - paczynski macronova / kilonova : a near - infrared ( nir)/optical transient powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath2process material synthesized in ejecta launched during the merger @xcite .    to date , the evidence of a macronova associated with sgrb 130603b is based on only a single data point @xcite .",
    "the peculiar grb 060614 was denoted as a  hybrid burst \" , since its @xmath3 s groups it with long - duration grbs , while its temporal lag and peak luminosity are within the short - duration grb subclass @xcite .",
    "moreover there is no evidence for an associated supernova emission @xcite down to very stringent limits .",
    "the most significant macronova evidence within this afterglow is due to a single hubble space telescope ( hst ) observation at @xmath4 days after the burst @xcite .",
    "further explorations of the afterglow allowed us to derive a tentative macronova light curve @xcite . in search for further evidence for other macronovae",
    "we explored the optical / ir afterglows of all other nearby short and hybrid grbs ( hgrbs ) in which macronova signals could have been detected .",
    "we begin with the study of grb 050709 , the first sgrb with an identified optical afterglow .",
    "previous works have found irregularity in this afterglow and interpreted it as a jet break @xcite or as an optical flare @xcite . reanalyzing the previous observations we suggest here that this irregularity arises due to a macronova component which in fact dominates the afterglow light curve in this burst .",
    "we then compare it with other grbs / macronovae and explore the implications of these results to the short - grb / macronova connection .",
    "we have identified a possible macronova in the optical afterglow data of sgrb 050709 .",
    "the @xmath5-band light curve of this macronova candidate is remarkably similar to that of the macronova candidate of hgrb 060614 @xcite , even though the isotropic - equivalent energy ( @xmath6 ) of their prompt emission and the x - ray afterglow light curve are significantly different .",
    "examination of the late - time optical@xmath7nir data of all nearby short and hgrbs ( @xmath8 ) for which a macronova could have been observed ( six in total ) revealed that there are three events grbs 050709 , 060614 , and 130603b in which a macronova candidate has been detected .",
    "the three other events do nt show such a signal but for each one of them there are concerns that explain this away .",
    "the appearance of a macronova candidate in three out of three ( or at most six ) events suggest that macronovae are ubiquitous .",
    "this supports strongly the hypothesis that compact binary mergers that are accompanied by sgrbs , are the prime sites of heavy r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the identifications of two of those macronova candidates in the @xmath5-band suggest that macronova could be more easily detected in gw follow - up searches , even without a grb trigger .",
    "grb 050709 was detected by the nasa s high energy transient explorer ( hete-2 ) and was localized by the hete-2 s soft x - ray camera @xcite .",
    "its prompt emission consisted of a hard spike ( @xmath9 s ) and an extended x - ray emission lasting @xmath10 s @xcite .",
    "the accurate localization led to follow - up observations allowed to identify the first optical afterglow of a short gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "about 1.5 days after the trigger of sgrb 050709 , hjorth et al .",
    "@xcite observed it with the _ danish _ 1.54 m telescope .",
    "they reported two @xmath11-band detections .",
    "fox et al .",
    "@xcite obtained four hst exposures in the f814w - band .",
    "the hst observed the site of sgrb 050709 one year later in the same band and did nt detect any signal .",
    "covino et al .",
    "@xcite observed the source with the very large telescope ( vlt ) in @xmath12 bands and detected the afterglow in @xmath13 and @xmath11 bands simultaneously on jul .",
    "12.4 ut . the optical afterglow that was localized with sub - arcsecond accuracy was in the outskirts of an irregular , late - type galaxy at a redshift of @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". the host s star - formation rate , @xmath15 , is much higher than that of the hosts of the two other sgrbs detected at the time , i.e. 050509b and 050724 , and it renders grb 050709 to be the first sgrb occurring in a star forming  low - luminosity \" galaxy @xcite .",
    "the x - ray afterglow observations of sgrb 050709 are scarce . at @xmath16",
    "s there are only two significant detections by chandra ( including an x - ray flare at @xmath17 days ) .",
    "two other _ swift _ ( @xmath18 days ) and chandra ( @xmath19 days ) data points have a significance of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "no radio afterglow emission has been detected @xcite .    already in 2005 ,",
    "fox et al .",
    "@xcite noted that the early hst optical / ir data declined as @xmath21 and then it dropped as @xmath22 between 10 and 20 days .",
    "they suggested that this arose due to a jet break .",
    "this interpretation was valid for the hst data set available at that time .",
    "later , watson et al . @xcite",
    "combined the optical / near - infrared ( nir ) data from the danish 1.54 m telescope , vlt and hst , and showed that the decline is much faster : a single power law of @xmath23 .",
    "a single hst data point at @xmath24 days was significantly above this line and this was interpreted as a flare powered by a central engine activity . following a re - analysis of all publicly available data",
    "we show that the light curve is chromatic and this rules out an afterglow scenario ( e.g. a jet break ) .",
    "we find a strong evidence for the presence of a new emission component besides the regular forward shock emission and that this component is strong not just at @xmath24 days but also at earlier times .",
    "we compare the light curve to the predictions of macronova estimates and we suggest that this nir excess lasting @xmath25 days indicates a macronova emission .    we have analyzed all publicly - available optical / nir data of the afterglow of sgrb 050709 ( see the methods for the details ) .",
    "results of our re - analysis are generally consistent with those reported in the literature @xcite . for the vlt data at @xmath26 days , we confirm the detection in @xmath11 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "however , while previous analysis of this data yielded only an upper limit of @xmath27 mag @xcite our reanalysis of the vlt @xmath5-band at @xmath28 days resulted in a detection with a vega magnitude of @xmath29 ( see the methods for a detailed discussion of this analysis ) .",
    "this @xmath5-band observation was almost coincidental with the @xmath11 and @xmath13 observations with which we can reliably estimate the energy distribution of the spectrum ( sed ) .",
    "we have also found an unpublished gemini optical observation giving a tight @xmath30 upper limit of @xmath31 mag on the @xmath11-band flux at @xmath32 days after the burst .",
    "the fig.[fig : lc](a ) depicts all the available optical / nir data .",
    "the @xmath11-band emission decreases as @xmath33 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath13-band data and with the overall fit of watson et al .",
    "note that the new @xmath11 band upper limit ( at @xmath32 days ) is consistent with the watson et al .",
    "@xcite s fit . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath5-band emission decreases much slower , as of @xmath34 , and this is consistent with the fox et al .",
    "@xcite s analysis of the early hst data alone .",
    "the standard afterglow model , implies an achromatic decay and hence the different behavior in the @xmath11 and @xmath5 bands over a long timescale of @xmath25 days is inconsistent with an afterglow model @xcite .",
    "in fact attempt to fit all the @xmath5 and @xmath11 band observations to a single achromatic broken power fails , with the best @xmath35-square p.d.f .",
    "obtained is of order 10 ( ignoring the hst data point at @xmath36 days does not solve the problem ) .",
    "this strongly suggests an additional component .",
    "-band emission ( green dashed line ) and to the @xmath5-band observations from the vlt @xmath5-band data as well as the first two hst f814w - band data points ( red dash - dotted line ) yield the declines of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines represent the  suggested \"- afterglow emission lightcurves of the grb outflow after the jet break ( i.e. , @xmath39 for the energy distribution index of the shock - accelerated electrons @xmath40 ) .",
    "( b ) : shown are the residuals of the optical emission after the subtraction of a suggested fast - declining forward shock afterglow after @xmath41 days ( dotted lines in the upper panel ) .",
    "the simulated @xmath42-band macronova light curves @xcite are for the ejecta from a black hole@xmath7neutron star merger , corresponding to an ejection mass of @xmath43 and a velocity of @xmath44 .",

    "( c ) : the sed of the macronova signal of sgrb 050709 measured by vlt on july 12 , 2005 compared with a possible iron line - like spectral structure adopted from kasen et al .",
    "note that all errors are @xmath46 statistical errors and the upper limits are at the @xmath30 confidence level .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    further information is obtained from the puzzling spectrum at @xmath28 days . here , the @xmath11 band flux is significantly larger than the @xmath5 band flux .",
    "this again is inconsistent with a standard afterglow model and it suggests that an additional component dominates already at this stage .",
    "namely , any afterglow emission is subdominant already at @xmath28 days .",
    "this can happen if there was an early jet break at @xmath47 days , in which case the afterglow would have declines from its observed value at @xmath41 days as @xmath48 , with @xmath49 .",
    "such a decline ( with @xmath50 , which is consistent with the x - ray spectrum ) is also shown in fig.[fig : lc ] . indeed , for @xmath51 and the cooling frequency @xmath52 hz at @xmath28 days , the extrapolation of the chandra x - ray emission into optical bands yields emission flux lower than the vlt data , consistent with the presence of a macronova emission component .",
    "both the required fast decline rate as well as the jet break time are consistent with that observed in some other sgrbs and in particular in sgrb 130603b and hgrb 060614 @xcite , two events displaying macronova signals .",
    "remarkably , even without the vlt i - band data , watson et al . @xcite already noticed that the decline is rather steep suggesting a post jet break afterglow and that at @xmath53 days the hst f814w - band emission was in excess of the regular forward shock afterglow emission . with the new data",
    "points the evidence for a macronova signal is much stronger .",
    "remarkably , this @xmath5/f814w macronova signal ( see fig.[fig : nir ] , where the suggested - afterglow component has been subtracted ) is very similar to that identified in hgrb 060614 @xcite .    in fig.[fig :",
    "lc](b ) we compared the observed lightcurves with the predictions of a macronova model .",
    "shown are the residual of the optical emission after the subtraction of a suggested forward shock afterglow with a fast declining emission after @xmath41 days and the theoretical lightcurves of a macronova following a black hole@xmath7neutron star merger @xcite with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the speed of light , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the ejecta mass and velocity , respectively .",
    "this is comparable but slightly smaller than the parameters used for fitting the @xmath5-band excess observed in the afterglow of grb 060614 @xcite .",
    "such a large amount of @xmath59-process material is consistent with a black - hole neutron star mergers @xcite and it also supports the hypothesis that compact object mergers are prime sites of significant production of @xmath2process elements @xcite .",
    "the black - hole neutron star merger scenario also has a significant implication on the prospect of establishing the grb / gw connection in the advanced ligo / virgo era @xcite .",
    "the weak @xmath5-band emission at @xmath28 days together with the almost simultaneous @xmath11 and @xmath13 observations , implies a puzzling broad line - like structure ( see fig.[fig : lc](c ) for the afterglow - subtracted sed ) .",
    "a speculative interpretation is that this signal is due to a disk wind driven macronova .",
    "a strong line feature can be produced by a macronova dominated by iron @xcite .",
    "such an iron - group dominated macronova may arise from an accretion disk wind  @xcite in which the heavier r - process elements are depleted because strong neutrino irradiation from a remnant neutron star or the accretion torus can increase the electron fraction of the disk material .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the sub - relativistic neutron - rich ejecta from the compact object mergers may have a heavier or lighter composition in different directions and the resulting signal may be a combination of macronovae resulting from those ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a telescope of the e - elt ( european extremely large telescope ) class will be able to carry out spectroscopy of these faint signals allowing a better understanding of the phenomena .    before concluding we note that if we do not rely on the re - analysis of the data , and adopt the afterglow interpretation of watson et al .",
    "@xcite , even in this case there is an @xmath5 band excess at @xmath60 days .",
    "the most natural explanation for this excess is also a macronova and the physical parameters are similar to that adopted in the modeling of fig.[fig : lc ] .      following the tentative discovery of a third macronova signal we have re - examined all nearby sgrbs and hgrbs to search for possible macronova signals .",
    "usually the macronova optical spectrum is expected to be soft , therefore ground - based deep @xmath5-band observations ( ground - based @xmath61-band observations usually are not deep enough ) as well as hst nir observations are essential .",
    "the macronova candidates emerged in the sgrb 130603b , hgrb 060614 and sgrb 050709 lightcurves 1 - 2 weeks after the grb triggers . at earlier times the forward shock afterglow emission outshines the macronova component while at late times the macronova emission also faded away .",
    "hence we need deep @xmath5-band or near - infrared hst observations in the time interval of @xmath62 days .",
    "theoretical predictions for macronovae vary significantly depending on the ejecta mass @xmath57 , the velocity @xmath63 , the composition , the merger types , and different observing angles ( see e.g. fig.10 of @xcite and fig.9 of @xcite for illustration ) . for a reference we note that the observed signatures were @xmath64 vega mag at about 9 days in f160w ( @xmath65 ) band for sgrb 130603b at redshift 0.356 , @xmath66 vega mag at about 13.5 days in f814w ( @xmath5 ) band for hgrb 060614 at redshift 0.125 and @xmath66 mag ( vega ) at about 10 days in f814w(@xmath5 ) band for sgrb 050709 at redshift 0.16 .",

    "no such observations were published yet for sgrb 150101b .",
    "the @xmath5/nir observation information of the remaining events , sgrbs 050509b , 050709 , 061201 and 130603b and hgrbs 060505 and 060614 are summarized in supplementary table 1 ( see the supplementary information ) .",
    "three events , sgrbs 050509b , 061201 and hgrb 060505 are potentially interesting but each one has its own caveat .",
    "the suggested host galaxy of sgrb 050509b is very bright and no optical counterpart had been detected .",
    "hence the upper limits on the  underlying \" afterglow and macronova emission sensitively depend on the unknown location within the host galaxy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift of grb 061201 is not secure @xcite and it is possible that it was not sufficiently nearby . using the hardness and prompt duration distribution bromberg et al .",
    "@xcite estimate that hgrb 060505 has a @xmath70 probability of being a collapsar ( see also the argument based on the location of the burst within a bright star forming region @xcite and host galaxy observations @xcite ) .",
    "upper limits of grb 080503 @xcite are also shown for an assumed redshift of @xmath71 , following kasen et al .",
    "note that the gemini @xmath72-band @xmath30 upper limit of sgrb 060505 was re - analyzed in this work .",
    "the red dashed line is the dynamical ejecta macronova model @xmath5-band emission while the red solid line is the disk - wind ejecta macronova model @xmath5-band emission light curve , where the same model parameters in fig.2 are chosen .",
    "the black dotted line represents the macronova i - band emission expected for a double neutron star merger @xcite with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , implying that the @xmath30 upper limits reported in sgrb 050509b , hgrb 060505 @xcite and sgrb 061201 are not deep enough to exclude the compact object merger origin .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    therefore , in total there are just three or at most six events that are sufficiently nearby and have sufficient data for a macronova identification . in the three of those ( sgrb 050709 , hgrb 060614 and sgrb 130603b ) there are macronovae signatures ( see fig.[fig : nir ] ) . in the three others potentially interesting events ( sgrb 050509b , hgrb 060505 and sgrb 061201 )",
    "there are only upper limits ( see fig.[fig : nir - ul ] ) but it is possible that none of them is sufficiently binding . in the most  optimistic \" case",
    "there are 3 macronovae in a sample consisting of just three events and the 95% confidence interval of the probability of a macronova taking place in a sgrb / hgrb is @xmath75 .",
    "while in the most  pessimistic \" case ( i.e. , there are 3 macronovae in a sample consisting of six grbs ) the 95% confidence interval for the probability is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the detection prospect of macronovae in merger - powered grbs are indeed encouraging though the fraction as low as @xmath77 can not be ruled out .    within this context",
    "it is interesting to mention also grb 080503 .",
    "it is not in our sample as its redshift is unknown @xcite . though no @xmath5-band / f814w - band or redder emission had been measured ( see fig.[fig : nir - ul ] , where the upper limits on the infrared luminosity are for a redshift @xmath78 , as assumed by kasen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in optical bands the afterglow was detected in the time interval of @xmath79 days after the grb trigger .",
    "the emission is quite blue , which is at odds with the dynamical ejecta macronova model but may be consistent with the disk - wind macronova model @xcite .",
    "the potential challenge for this model is the non - identification of a nearby host galaxy as close as @xmath78 in the deep hst / wfpc2 observation data of grb 080503 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare now the observed features of the three macronova candidates .",
    "as far as the prompt emission is concerned , grb 050709 , a short burst with extended soft x - ray emission , bridges the gap between the canonical sgrb 130603b and the hgrb 060614 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent prompt emission energy @xmath80 of sgrb 050709 is about 30 times smaller than that of hgrb 060614 and sgrb 130603b , while the macronova emission of sgrb 050709 is similar to that of hgrb 060614 ( see fig.[fig : nir ] ) .",
    "the high energy transients were powered by a relativistic jet emerging from the central engine while the macronova emission arises from the @xmath59-process material ejected during the merger .",
