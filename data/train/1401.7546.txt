    "since the early days of thermodynamics there has been a debate whether or not the stationary state of a non - isothermal system can be described in terms of equilibrium properties @xcite .",
    "classical examples are the soret and seebeck - peltier effects @xcite : the latter accounts for the coupling between heat flow and electric current in a conducting material . though the seebeck and peltier coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 describe dissipative phenomena , thomson showed that irreversibility drops out in the ratio @xmath2 , which is simply given by temperature .",
    "several attempts at a rigorous derivation failed , until onsager pointed out the role of microscopic reversibility and established thomson s relations as special cases of his reciprocal laws @xcite .",
    "the soret effect describes the mass flow induced by a temperature gradient in a complex fluid @xcite .",
    "it was first observed for electrolyte solutions , where salt accumulates at the cold side @xcite ; the non - uniform steady - state concentration @xmath3  is given by the soret equilibrium  @xcite @xmath4 this effect is essential for understanding the compositional grading in the earth s petroleum reservoirs @xcite , the isotope fractionation in silicate melts @xcite , and the energy balance of carbon - nanotube based thermogalvanic cells @xcite . in microchannels and thin films , the soret effect is an efficient means for colloidal confinement and for accumulating molecular solutes at a micron - sized heated spot @xcite . in spite of various attempts to elucidate its physical mechanisms , there is so far no generally accepted theoretical framework for the soret coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "a most fundamental question is whether it can be obtained from equilibrium theory , or whether it necessarily reflects the irreversible nature of the underlying dissipative flows .",
    "this is not a merely formal issue but affects measurable quantities , e.g. , how @xmath5 depends on the particle size @xcite .    in an early approach eastman considered two small but macroscopic cells at temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the probability for a particle moving from one cell to the other is related to the corresponding change of entropy , absorbed or released by the surrounding liquid . as an essential step in his argument",
    ", eastman identified this transfer quantity  with the canonical entropy @xmath8 carried by the solute , where @xmath9 is the single - particle free enthalpy or gibbs energy ; his result reads in modern notation @xmath10 in this thermostatic approach , the soret coefficient is related to an equilibrium thermodynamic potential .",
    "a rather different picture emerges from onsager s non - equilibrium theory , that is based on the entropy balance equation for reversible and irreversible changes ; the former correspond to the entropy transfer and the latter to dissipation or entropy production .",
    "heat and mass flows are driven by generalized forces ; the current of solute particles @xmath11 accounts for fick diffusion with the einstein coefficient @xmath12 and for thermophoresis with mobility @xmath13 @xcite . comparing the steady - state condition @xmath14 with ( [ 2 ] ) gives the soret parameter @xmath15 since @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not form a pair of reciprocal coefficients , their ratio is expected to reflect the underlying dissipative motion .",
    "in contrast to this view , eq . (",
    "[ 6 ] ) relates @xmath5 to an equilibrium free enthalpy .",
    "this discrepancy was already noted by de groot in his 1945 thesis @xcite . in recent years a controversial discussion aroused from experiments on collodial suspensions that reported a quadratic @xcite or linear @xcite dependence of the soret coefficient on the particle size .",
    "either of these findings is supported by a number of theoretical works which may be loosely classified as equilibrium  @xcite  and dissipative  @xcite approaches .",
    "the present paper intends to resolve this discrepancy by investigating the relation between  eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "starting from a general gibbs interaction energy and relying on standard colloidal transport theory , we evaluate the viscous factors occurring in ( [ 8 ] ) and , in particular , determine under which conditions they drop out in the ratio @xmath16 . as an unambiguous signature for dissipation ,",
    "we calculate the steady - state entropy production of the viscous flow around a solute particle .",
    "we consider a dilute solution in a non - uniform temperature and assume that mechanical and local thermal equilibrium is established .",
    "this assumption has several important implications @xcite : ( i ) the macroscopic pressure is constant throughout the system .",
    "( ii ) the dufour effect being small in liquids , the temperature profile @xmath17 is independent of composition and constant in time . (",
    "iii ) more generally , the properties of a small but macroscopic subvolume are described by equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "thus we may define a free - enthalpy density @xmath18 that describes the mutual forces of a particle and the surrounding fluid .",
    "it depends on position both explicitly through the interaction and implicitly through the non - uniform temperature .",
    "relevant mechanisms are the electric - double layer energy , the van der waals potential , and depletion forces due to an additional molecular solute .",
    "the solvation free enthalpy or gibbs energy of a single particle is given by @xmath19 the integrand is most significant within the range of interaction @xmath20 and rapidly decreases at larger distances @xcite . for electric - double layer forces",
    ", @xmath20 corresponds to the debye length and @xmath21 decays exponentially as @xmath22 .",
    "dispersion forces have no intrinsic length scale but decrease with a power law ; then @xmath20 may be taken as the particle size .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are very general and apply to any interactions as long as @xmath18  decays sufficiently rapidly at large distances .    for low dilution and in the absence of long - range interactions ,",
    "the chemical potential consists of the single - particle gibbs energy and a contribution accounting for the translational entropy @xmath23 , @xmath24 the spatially varying temperature @xmath17 is imposed by the experimental setup , whereas the concentration profile @xmath25 remains to be determined .",
    "we briefly discuss the origin of the relation ( [ 6 ] ) , which was first obtained by eastman for the soret effect of electrolyte solutions and since then has been applied to molecular mixtures and colloidal particles .",
    "eastman explicitly discards dissipative processes and retains reversible changes of the thermodynamic potential only . considering a  particle that migrates between cells  with temperature and concentration differences @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", he defines the entropy of transfer  @xmath28 through the change of the chemical potential due to the uniform concentration @xmath29 ( at this point , the unknown soret coefficient @xmath5 has merely been replaced by the unknown @xmath28 . ) as the essential step of his approach , eastman then identifies @xmath28 with the canonical single - particle entropy @xmath0 and thus obtains ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "subsequent works derived eastman s formula from the condition that the gradient of the free energy or the chemical potential vanishes .",
    "the underlying idea is to interprete @xmath30 as the mechanical force acting on a particle and , accordingly , the relation @xmath31 as the steady - state condition . to linear order in the gradients one has @xmath32 comparing with ( [ 2 ] ) gives indeed eastman s expression for the soret coefficient .",

    "the gibbs energy and the chemical potential are not well defined for a system with non - uniform temperature ; thus the steady - state condition eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) is beyond the domain of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "eastman s approach heavily relies on identifying @xmath28 with the canonical entropy @xmath0 ; so far there is no justification for this essential step in his argument .",
    "here we evaluate the soret coefficient from onsager s theory for non - equlibrium systems . for small particles we start from the generalized thermodynamic force . for large particles ,",
    "the thermodiffusion and diffusion currents have to be evaluated separately because of their different viscous properties .      brownian motion of a particle suspended in a liquid",
    "was related by einstein to the thermal agitation of nearby molecules , which acts as a random external force .",
    "there are two important consequences , the mean - square displacement increases linearly with time , and a concentration gradient results in a diffusion current @xmath34 , where the coefficient is given by the stokes - einstein relation @xmath35 this expression is valid over a large range in solute size , from small molecules of a few   to large colloidal particles that are visible to the naked eye .",
    "the same law holds true for diffusion of polymers , with @xmath36 corresponding to the gyration radius @xcite . for later use",
    "we give the velocity corresponding to gradient diffusion , @xmath37     in the vicinity of an immobile solute particle .",
    "the velocity is zero at the particle surface , increases exponentially within the interaction length @xmath20 indicated by a dashed circle , and decays as @xmath38 at larger distances the left and right panels show the cases of small and large particles , respectively .",
    "the velocity profile along the vertical dotted lines is shown in fig .",
    "2 . ]      in the framework of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , the generalized force exerted on a dispersed particle reads @xmath40 @xcite . inserting ( [ 17 ] ) and multiplying with @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 we have used the implicit spatial variation of the free enthalpy @xmath43 and , in the second equality , the gibbs - helmholtz equation @xmath44 , which epresses the relation @xmath45 between free enthalpy @xmath9 , enthalpy @xmath46 , and entropy @xmath0",
    ".    the soret coefficient is obtained from two conditions .",
    "first , we identify the stationary state with zero thermodynamic force , @xmath47 .",
    "second , we assume that the mobility parameter of both force terms in ( [ 20b ] ) is given by stokes friction @xmath48 .",
    "this is obvious for the diffusion term ( [ 20 ] ) and provides a good approximation for the thermodiffusion current in the limit @xmath39 , in analogy to hckel s treatment of electrophoresis @xcite .",
    "comparison with ( [ 8 ] ) then gives @xmath49 corrections to this approximate result are of the order @xmath50 .",
    "the soret coefficient is given by the ratio @xmath51 irreversibility drops out since @xmath12  et @xmath13  carry the same friction coefficient .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) states that for particles much smaller than the range of the solute - solvent interaction , the soret coefficient is given by the solvation enthalpy @xmath46 . a particle that strongly interacts with the solvent @xmath52 moves to the cold , whereas a solute with a positive solvation enthalpy is driven to the warm .",
    "the above result significantly differs from eastman s formula .",
    "the latter provides a good approximation only if @xmath53 is small as compared to the derivative @xmath54 .",
    "this seems to be the case for small ions in an electrolyte solution : the soret coefficient obtained by dhont @xcite from ( [ 6 ] ) corresponds to the result from the non - equilibrium thermodynamics approach @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic force ( [ 20b ] ) agrees with the boltzmann type distribution function @xmath55 that was used by duhr and braun @xcite and confirmed by astumian @xcite .",
    "the general 1d steady - state distribution was given by van kampen in a study on diffusion in non - uniform media @xcite .",
    "as a common feature these works assume , more or less explicitly , that the dissipative factor of the drift velocity @xmath56 is given by stokes - einstein form @xmath57 ; this is justified for small particles of radius @xmath39 .",
    "now we turn to the opposite case illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "then the viscous stress on the fluid is concentrated in a boundary layer of thickness @xmath20 at the particle surface , where stokes equation takes a rather simple form @xcite . from a general argument relying on the symmetry of onsager s coefficients ,",
    "derjaguin calculated the quasi - slip velocity @xcite which gives the thermophoretic mobility in the form @xmath59 where an integral over the solvation enthalpy density @xmath60,@xmath61 in the latter integral the quantity @xmath62 is the distance from the particle surface .    for large particles both the enthalpy density @xmath63 and the quantity @xmath64 are independent of the radius @xmath36 , whereas the volume integral @xmath65 is proportional to the surface area . as a most important feature ,",
    "the velocity @xmath66 and the mobility @xmath13 are independent of the solute size ; this is a particular case of a general rule for motion driven by interfacial forces @xcite .",
    "the above form for the diffusion coefficient implies that the ratio@xmath67 increases linearly with  the particle radius .",
    "this result generalizes previous work on electrostatic and dispersion forces @xcite ; for charged particles , the double - layer enthalpy @xmath63 comprises the energy density of the electric field and the excess ion osmotic pressure @xcite .",
    "the underlying hydrodynamic treatment of interfacial forces parallels smoluchowski s treatment of electrophoresis and is widely used in colloidal transport theory @xcite .",
    "we have discarded the possiblility of hydrodynamicc slippage @xcite .",
    "regarding the ratio ( [ 10 ] ) we first note that the diffusion coefficient of polymers is proportional to the inverse gyration radius @xmath68 , due to long - range hydrodynamic interactions between the flexible units of the polymer @xcite .",
    "the thermophoretic mobility @xmath13 is independent of the molecular weight , as first derived by brochard and de gennes from general arguments ; for more detail see @xcite . in physical terms , the gibbs energy @xmath21 does not cause hydrodynamic interactions beyond the interaction range @xmath20 . thus eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) remains valid for polymers .",
    "since the gyration radius scales with the number @xmath69 of monomers according to the power law @xmath70 , the soret coefficient@xmath71 shows a characteristic molecular - weight dependence . as a side remark ,",
    "this scaling ceases to be valid for chains of less than hundred monomers , where an additional thermodiffusion mechanism sets in @xcite .",
    "_ polymers .",

    "for most real polymers , @xmath74 rather corresponds to the persistence length and is larger than a monomer ; accordingly , @xmath69 gives the number of such units .",

    "the experimental law is in perfect agreement with the expression obtained from the ratio of transport coefficients ( [ 7a ] ) .    for sufficiently long chains the gibbs energy is proportional to the molecular weight , @xmath77 , and",
    "so is eastman s expression,@xmath78 with the monomer soret coefficient @xmath79 .",
    "this linear dependence does not match the experimental finding . since the scaling law @xmath80 is a fundamental thermodynamic property of high polymers ,",
    "the failure of eastman s expression can not be mended .",
    "the same argument holds true for similar approaches based on the chemical potential , which for a long chain is an extensive quantity , @xmath81 .",
    "_ colloidal particles .",
    "_  we discuss the size dependence of the soret coefficient of large colloidal particles . for charged polystyrene beads confined in an 10-micron chamber ,",
    "a quadratic variation @xmath82 was found for radii ranging from 20 nm to 1 @xmath83 m @xcite , whereas subsequent experiments reported a linear dependence @xmath84 for both solid particles @xcite and microemulsion droplets @xcite     the gibbs energy of large particles is proportional to the surface area , @xmath85 , resulting in the quadratic law @xmath82 for eastman s expression ( [ 6 ] ) , which has been used for fitting the data of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , since the einstein coefficient is inversely proportional to the radius and @xmath13 independent of the particle size @xcite , the ratio ( [ 28 ] ) results in @xmath86 , in agreement with the data of refs .",
    "a more complex situation occurs for strongly hydrophobic particles with a finite slip length , where a quadratic dependence is obtained for intermediate particle size @xcite ; yet this effect can be discarded for micron - sized beads .",
    "here we relate the title of this paper to the question whether or not the soret equilibrium ( [ 2 ] ) produces entropy .",
    "the thermostatic approach ( [ 6 ] ) relies on the assumption that the non - uniform solute distribution does not contribute to dissipation .",
    "this is obvious from eastman s argument : the entropy of transfer  @xmath8 accounts only for the reversible change that occurs while a particle migrates between regions of different temperatures . in this picture , the non - uniform steady state described by ( [ 2 ] ) is not related to dissipation and , as a consequence , does not produce entropy .       as a fundamental aspect of onsager s non - equilibrium thermodynamics , dissipation is related to flows of heat and matter .",

    "[ fig2]b shows an open system at constant temperature that is in contact with two reservoirs at different concentration .",
    "this concentration gradient results in a stationary current @xmath91 , which is constant throughout the sample . since the entropy per particle is higher in the low - concentration reservoir , the entropy per unit time leaving at the left boundary exceeds that entering at the right .",
    "this net outward flow is supplemented by the entropy production within the system . for later use",
    "we give the entropy production per particle , @xmath95    the last term in @xmath96 is given by the contraction of the tensor of velocity derivatives @xmath97 and the symmetric part of the viscous stress @xmath98 . in the stationary state",
    "the latter reads @xmath99 , with the solvent viscosity @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the total entropy production @xmath101 due to the viscous flow in the vicinity of a single particle is obtained by spelling out the components of the stress tensor @xmath98 and taking the volume integral @xcite , @xmath102 in the following we show that the solute particles dissipate energy , even in the steady state @xmath14 . though the entropy production is much smaller than the heat - current driven term @xmath103 and thus difficult to measure , it is an important signature for the dissipative nature of the soret equilibrium state .    in the following we consider the entropy production due to the solute particles .",
    "the steady state @xmath14 is attained if diffusion and drift velocities cancel each other , @xmath104 .",

    "quite to the contrary , the well - known long range behavior @xmath110 and @xmath111 implies that @xmath109 is finite at distances beyond the particle radius ( @xmath112 ) @xcite .",

    "the mean velocity field related to gradient diffusion reads @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the radial unit vector and @xmath115 the velocity at the particle surface .",
    "the term arising from the thermophoretic drift can not be given in closed form ; in the following we discuss two limiting cases with respect to the particle size .      for the entropy production @xmath101",

    "the rate of entropy production ( [ 29a ] ) by far exceeds that of the corresponding diffusion current @xmath137 .",

    "thus the surrounding of a given molecule consists of all species ; the low - dilution limit does not apply , and thermodiffusion of a given species has to be evaluated self - consistently .       in order to avoid these difficulties , thermodiffusion of non - ionic molecular liquids has been described in a thermostatic approach , where the soret coefficient @xmath146 is given by the heat @xmath147 carried by each of the components .",

    "this has been traced back to the fact that drift and diffusion of small particles lead to rather similar velocity fields @xmath119 and @xmath118 @xcite and thus carry the same friction factor .",
    "the latter drops out in the steady state , and @xmath5 is determined by the solvation enthalpy @xmath46 . for large particles , on the contrary , @xmath119 and @xmath118 have little in common .",
    "thus it does not come as a surprise that the transport coefficients differ in their viscous factors and , as a consequence , in their dependence on the particle radius , @xmath171 and constant @xmath13 . from a general transport theory point of view , this analysis parallels what is known for electrophoresis , where our eqs .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) correspond to the hckel and smoluchowski limits @xcite .",
    "these considerations are supported by experimental findings .",
    "most data on colloidal particles @xcite confirm the linear dependence @xmath84 of ( [ 28 ] ) , whereas eastman s expression ( [ 6 ] ) predicts a variation with the surface area @xmath82 . by the same token",
    ", eastman s equilibrium approach fails when applied to polymers .",
    "the free enthalpy of a polymer chain increases with the number @xmath69 of monomers and would result in @xmath172 according to ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "soret data on dilute polystyrene solutions , however , vary with the gyration radius @xmath173 where @xmath76 in a good solvent @xcite , in agreement with brochard and de gennes general argument @xcite , which is explicited in our eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the law @xmath84 provides an unambiguous signature for dissipative motion : the thermophoretic mobility @xmath13 of polymers is constant because of the associated short - range viscous flow , whereas the dependence @xmath171 arises from long - range hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the cases where the range of interaction @xmath20 is much smaller or much larger than the solute size @xmath36 , can be treated in controlled approximations .",
    "a more difficult situation arises for molecular mixtures with dispersion forces , where both length scales are comparable . though none of the approximation schemes apply in this case , the relation @xmath152 suggests that the thermostatic approch does not in general provide a reliable expression for the soret coefficient",

    "( [ 40 ] ) describes , at least qualitatively , the variation with the composition and the molecular size ratio . regarding the isotope effect , purely thermostatic theories do not account for the mass dependence @xcite .",
    "we have seen that for small solute particles , the einstein and thermodiffusion coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 carry the same mobility factor , such that the ratio @xmath16 reduces to an equlibrium quantity .",
    "the physical origin of this cancellation of viscous factors , however , is less fundamental than microscopic reversibility that operates in thomson s relation @xmath2 for the peltier and seebeck coefficients , or in the reciprocal law relating @xmath13 and the dufour coefficient @xcite .    as a main result of this paper",
    "we have shown that a non - uniform solute concentration in a temperature gradient implies necessarily dissipation due to viscous flow @xmath92 in the vicinity of each solute particle , as illustrated in fig .",
