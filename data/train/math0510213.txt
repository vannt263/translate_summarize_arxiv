    "i.e. the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of @xmath1 . by @xmath4",
    "we denote the _ mapping class group _ i.e. the subgroup of @xmath3 consisting of orientation preserving maps .",
    "we will make no distinction between a map and its isotopy class , so in particular by the order of a homeomorphism @xmath5 we mean the order of its class in @xmath3 .    by @xmath6",
    "we denote the right dehn twists along the curves @xmath7 indicated in figure [ r1 ] .",
    "it is known that this set of generators of @xmath4 is not minimal , and a great deal of attention has been paid to the problem of finding a minimal ( or at least small ) set of generators or a set of generators with some additional property . for different approaches to this problem",

    "the main purpose of this note is to prove that for @xmath0 the extended mapping class group @xmath3 is generated by three symmetries , i.e. orientation reversing involutions .",

    "this proves that each of generating twists is a product of two symmetries .",
    "note that for the composition of mappings we use the following convention : @xmath16 means that @xmath2 is applied first .",

    "@xmath20 is defined to be the centraliser of @xmath21 in @xmath4 . by @xcite",
    "the quotient @xmath22 is isomorphic to the mapping class group @xmath23 of a sphere @xmath24 with @xmath25 marked points @xmath26 .",
    "this set of marked points corresponds ( under the canonical projection ) to fixed points of @xmath21 ( figure [ r1 ] ) . in a similar way",

    "in particular @xmath48 has order @xmath49 . using the technique described in @xcite it is easy to write @xmath48 as a product of twists : @xmath50    since every finite subgroup of @xmath4 can be realised as the group of automorphisms of a riemann surface @xcite , @xmath48 has maximal order among torsion elements of @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "it is well known @xcite that the mapping class group @xmath3 is isomorphic to the group @xmath56 of outer automorphisms of @xmath52 . in terms of this isomorphism ,",
    "elements of @xmath4 correspond to the elements of @xmath56 which map the relation @xmath57 to its conjugate , and elements of @xmath58 to those elements of @xmath56 which map @xmath57 to a conjugate of @xmath59 .",
    "using representations of twist generators as automorphisms of @xmath52 @xcite we could derive the following representation for the rotation @xmath48 : @xmath60 as in the case of maps and their isotopy classes , we abuse terminology by identifying an element of @xmath56 with its representative in @xmath61 .",
    "if we represent the action of the rotation @xmath45 as the orthogonal action on the unit sphere , it becomes obvious that @xmath45 can be written as a product of two symmetries . to be more precise , if @xmath62 is the symmetry across the plane passing through @xmath63 and the center of the sphere ( figure [ r2 ] ) , then @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is another symmetry .",
    "tedious but straightforward computations show that one of the liftings @xmath66 of @xmath62 has the following representation as an automorphism of @xmath52 : @xmath67 to obtain the above representation we proceed as follows : take a generator @xmath12 of @xmath52 , find the image @xmath68 of @xmath12 under projection @xmath69 , find @xmath70 , lift back @xmath70 to @xmath1 and finally express the obtained loop as a product of generators @xmath51 of @xmath52 .",
    "we would like to point out that although the above procedure is a bit subtle , it is quite simple to verify that the obtained formulas are correct .",
    "in fact , it is enough to check that @xmath71 and @xmath72 is conjugate to @xmath59 .",

    "is well known for @xmath76 , but for the sake of completeness let us prove this in more geometric way . since @xmath77 ( figure [ r1 ] ) and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , the group @xmath80 is generated by the symmetries @xmath81 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath17 .",
