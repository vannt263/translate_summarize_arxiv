    "most of our understanding of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is based on samples of agn detected in uv / optical surveys .",
    "indeed , key advances such as measuring high cosmological redshifts @xcite and developing the orientation - based unified schemes ( see @xcite ) are based on the study of agn at uv / optical wavelengths .",
    "however , there has been increasing evidence that a large fraction of agn have not been detected in uv / optical surveys because they are obscured by large columns of dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "surveys at infrared and radio wavelengths suggest that up to 80% of all agn may have been missed in current uv / optical surveys ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a key result of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) was the discovery of a population of agn that appear redder than their traditional optical / uv selected counterparts at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the red 2mass agn were selected to have j - k@xmath1 @xmath2 2.0 , distinguishing them from most optical / uv selected agn that have bluer near - ir colours",
    "( j - k@xmath1 @xmath0 2.0 ; @xcite ) , and k - band magnitudes in the range 11.0 @xmath0 k@xmath1 @xmath0 14.9 mag .",
    "the latter criterion was chosen so that bright ( k@xmath1 @xmath0 11.0 ) galactic agb and carbon stars were excluded , along with ` normal ' galaxies in the redshift range 0.4 @xmath0 z @xmath0 0.5 ( k@xmath1 @xmath4 14.9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow up of the objects which fulfill these criteria revealed that the majority of the candidates have spectra resembling agn @xcite .",
    "more recent surveys have determined that these red quasars do indeed represent a large fraction of the overall population of quasars in the local universe ( @xmath51560@xmath6 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    because the red quasars potentially make up a large fraction of the agn population , it is important that we understand their relationship to the unobscured population : are they young , dust obscured versions of typical quasars  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ? or can their properties be explained by a specific viewing angle in the orientation - based unified schemes @xcite ? or do they perhaps represent a new population altogether ?",
    "are these objects all luminous quasars , or are some less luminous agn ?",
    "past studies of red 2mass quasars have found reddenings in the range 0.1 @xmath0 e(b - v ) @xmath0 3.2 magnitudes based on balmer decrements and fits to the continuum shape ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although it is important to recognise that some have negligible reddening @xcite .",
    "in addition , imaging studies of the host galaxies find evidence for disturbed morphologies in up to 70% of cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which may support the idea that host galaxies have undergone recent interactions with other galaxies . such interactions could drive material into the central region of the galaxies , enshrouding the smbh in a cocoons of dust @xcite , making them difficult to detect in traditional uv / optical surveys @xcite .",
    "many previous studies of red quasars have focussed on samples covering a wide range of redshift ( 0 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3 : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with such samples is it is difficult to investigate the intrinsic diversity of the red quasar population in the face of possible evolutionary and/or luminosity - dependent effects .",
    "therefore it is important to study a sample of 2mass - selected agn that covers a more limited range in redshift .",
    "this paper reports observations of an ra - limited sample of 27 2mass selected quasars ( j - k@xmath1 @xmath2 2.0 ) with a narrow range of redshifts : 0.09 @xmath0 z @xmath0 0.20 .",
    "we aim to determine how the red 2mass agn fit into our picture of active galaxies in general , and how important they are to our understanding of agn . in this , the first of two papers ( paper i )",
    ", we report a spectroscopic study of this sample , focussing on the agn properties , emission line outflows and dust extinction .",
    "the spectral properties are compared to control samples of optical / uv selected quasars and agn .",
    "paper ii in the series will focus on the near- and mid - ir properties of the sample , and will include a comprehensive comparison with several complete samples of active galaxies .",
    "the cosmological parameters used throughout this paper are adopted from wmap : @xmath7 = 71 km s@xmath8 , @xmath9 = 0.27 and @xmath10 = 0.73 @xcite .",
    "the full sample for this survey comprises a complete ra - limited ( 2 @xmath0 ra @xmath0 15 hr ) sub - sample of 27 objects with red near - ir colours ( j - k@xmath1 @xmath2 2 ) , k - band magnitudes 11.0 @xmath0 ks @xmath0 14.9 mag , and redshifts @xmath11 selected from the list of @xcite , which is itself representative of the population of red , 2mass - selected quasars .",
    "we also observed a further 2 objects from @xcite that fall outside the original redshift and/or ra range : j1637 + 25 ( z=0.277 ) , and j2124 - 17 ( z=0.111 ) .",
    "therefore , the total sample consists of 29 objects , however two of these objects have redshifts z@xmath40.2 .",
    "although we present the data for the full 29 objects , we only consider the results for the 27 objects with redshifts z@xmath00.2 in the analysis .",
    "table [ prop ] shows the basic properties of the sample .",
    "low resolution optical spectroscopic observations of the sample were taken with the isis dual - arm spectrograph on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma in three runs : the 28th of july 2006 , 8th and 9th of february 2007 , and the 26th and 27th of september 2011 .",
    "the data were taken with the isis dual arm spectrograph on the wht .",
    "on the red arm , the r158r grating was used with the redplus ccd , and on the blue arm , the r300b grating was used with the eev12 ccd .",
    "a dichroic cutting at 5300  was employed to obtain spectra simultaneously in the blue ( @xmath53250 - 5250 ) , and in the red ( @xmath55200 - 9500 ) . to reduce the effects of differential refraction",
    ", all exposures were taken when the objects were at low airmass ( sec @xmath12 @xmath0 1.1 ) and/or with the slit aligned close to the parallactic angle .",
    "the seeing for the nights of the observations varied over the range 0.8 @xmath0 fwhm @xmath0 1.3 arcseconds .",
    "sets of three exposures were taken on both arms simultaneously for each object using a 1.5 arcsecond slit .",
    "an additional wider slit ( 5 arcseconds ) exposure was taken on both arms for 23 of the objects .",
    "this was to assess the effect of possible slit losses on the emission line flux . to eliminate contamination from second order emission",
    ", a gg495 blocking filter was introduced into the isis red arm .",
    "the exposure times for each object are given in table [ prop ] .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way ( bias subtraction , flat fielding , cosmic ray removal , wavelength calibration , flux calibration ) using packages in iraf .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were also corrected for spatial distortions . to reduce wavelength calibration errors due to flexure of the telescope and instrument ,",
    "arc spectra were taken at the position of the object on the sky .",
    "based on measurements of the night sky lines , the wavelength calibration uncertainties are 0.1  on both the blue and red arms , and the narrow slit spectral resolution is estimated to be @xmath55.6 and @xmath510.5  on the blue and red arms respectively for 23/29 of the objects , and @xmath56.6  and @xmath56.1  for the blue and red arms for the rest of the sample ( see table [ prop ] ) .",
    "atmospheric absorption features were removed by dividing the red spectrum of each object by that of a telluric standard , taken close in time and airmass to the observations of 27/29 of the objects .",
    "no telluric standards were taken for j1637 + 25 and j2124 - 17 , and therefore the atmospheric features were not removed for those objects .",
    "the spatial pixel scales of the 2d spectra are 0.4 arcseconds in the blue and 0.44 arcseconds in the red , and the relative flux calibration uncertainty  based on 11 observations of 8 flux standard stars taken throughout the runs  is estimated to be @xmath135% .",
    "the spectra were extracted and analysed using the starlink packages figaro and dipso .",
    "all extracted spectra were corrected for galactic extinction using the galactic extinction maps of @xcite and the extinction laws of of @xcite for the uv , and @xcite for the optical / ir , prior to the analysis . in order to investigate the nuclear spectra , we extracted apertures centred on the nuclei of the targets in the 2d spectra , with aperture sizes chosen such that the full flux from the nucleus of each object was extracted .",
    "the aperture sizes are given in table [ prop ] and the extracted spectra are shown in figure [ specs ] .",

    "type gives the spectral type of the agn .",
    "we only classify an object as type 1 if it shows significant ( i.e. well above the noise ) broad wings that can not be accounted for by the [ oiii ] model fitted to the h@xmath14+[nii ] lines .",
    "redshifts and [ oiii ] emission line luminosities ( l@xmath15}$ ] ) were determined using the [ oiii]@xmath35007 emission line , and j - k@xmath1 values were taken from the 2mass point source catalogue .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,<,^,<,^ , < , < , < \" , ]     there have been several studies of red 2mass agn in the past that have focussed on different wavelength regions of the seds of the population ( e.g. x - ray , uv , optical or ir ) . in this section",
    "we outline the basic properties and findings of these studies , and compare them with the results obtained in this paper , in order to determine the nature of our red , low - z , 2mass agn sample .",
    "the basic properties of the samples used for the previous studies are summarised in table [ discussion ] .",
    "many of these past studies conclude that the red 2mass quasars are young , dust - enshrouded , transitional objects .",
    "this conclusion is based on several lines of evidence , including a high rate of morphological disturbance of the host galaxies @xcite , a relatively high rate of occurrence low ionization broad absorption lines ( lobals ; @xcite ) , evidence for enhanced star formation rates compared to typical uv / optical selected agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and high eddington ratios for the gas being accreted by the central super - massive black holes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , although the results from our local 2mass agn sample agree with the these previous studies in the sense that we determine the same moderate levels of reddening , we find no strong evidence that these are young quasars based on their [ oiii ] outflow properties , the incidence of nls1 , and the distribution of eddington ratios . indeed ,",
    "the properties our 2mass sample appear similar to those of the samples of uv / optical selected quasars in the local universe .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the conclusions of our study and the previous studies that identify the red 2mass objects as young , transition objects may be due to different selection criteria .",
    "in particular , the glikman et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 , 2011 , 2012 ) , georgakakis ( 2009 ) and urrutia et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 , 2012 ) samples extend up to much higher redshifts than our local sample , include optical colour selection criteria as well as near - ir colour selection , and some require the objects to have broad lines ; in addition , glikman et al . ( 2004 , 2007 , 2011 , 2012 ) require detection of the objects in the first radio survey .",
    "such selection criteria favour more extreme objects that are more likely to be genuinely young and dust enshrouded .    in this context",
    "it is notable that other studies of 2mass agn which are based on lower redshift samples and/or samples selected without additional optical colour criteria ( the bottom four entries in table 8) , agree with with the conclusions of our investigation , albeit using different analysis techniques :    * from x - ray to fir sed studies , and pca analysis of a population of red 2mass agn , @xcite conclude that the red 2mass agn are not observed at a younger evolutionary phase than other local samples ; * using i - band hst images to study the host galaxies of red 2mass agn , and comparing their findings to the pg quasars and a sample of ulirgs , @xcite find no indication that red 2mass agn represent young , dust enshrouded , transitional objects ; * by comparing optical broad - band polarimetry results of red 2mass agn , pg quasars and bal agn , @xcite find that overall 2mass agn show relatively high levels of polarization ( p @xmath4 3% ) , consistent with the idea that orientation / obscuration effects are responsible for the red nir colours .",
    "these comparisons between the previous studies of the red 2mass agn emphasise the sensitivity of the conclusions to the precise selection criteria employed for the particular samples .",
    "however , it is seems unlikely that the majority of low redshift 2mass agn that are selected solely on the basis of near - ir colour [ @xmath16 are young , transitional objects .",
    "in this work we present a study of the optical spectra of a representative sample of 29 nearby ( z @xmath0 0.28 ) 2mass - selected agn with red near - ir colours ( j - k@xmath1 @xmath2 2.0 ) .",
    "we compare the results from this sample with those obtained for comparison samples of pg quasars and unobscured type 1 agn .",
    "we find the following .",
    "* overall the local 2mass agn population show significantly higher reddening than samples of uv / optical selected agn .",
    "however , while some objects are highly reddened ( e(b - v)=1.2 ) , others show relatively little ( if any ) reddening .",
    "* the velocity shifts and widths of the [ oiii ] lines of the red 2mass agn are not significantly larger than those of the comparison samples .",
    "* the eddington ratios of the 2mass agn and the incidence of nls1 type objects are comparable with those of ` typical ' agn .",
    "these results do not support the view that the local red 2mass agn represent young quasars in a transitional phase , where the agn are emerging from their natal cocoons of gas and dust .",
    "however , they are consistent with the idea that these objects are reddened either by obscuring dust in the outer layers of the circum - nuclear torii , or by dust in the kpc - scale disks of the host galaxies .    in paper",
    "ii we will focus on the near - ir properties of this sample of red 2mass agn , and investigate the origin of their red j - k@xmath1 colours .",

    "* j0221 + 13 * is classified as an intermediate type agn ( type 1.8 ) in both @xcite and @xcite , however our classification is consistent with the findings of @xcite : a type 2 agn .",
    "such a difference can be explained by the difference in s / n between the spectra used to identify the agn type .",
    "* j0312 + 07 * is a type 1 seyfert galaxy with j - k@xmath1 = 1.98 .",
    "a companion object is detected on the 2d spectrum at a distance of @xmath5400@xmath1380 kpc from the nucleus of j0312 + 07 .",
    "interestingly , the continuum of this companion appears redder than the continuum of j0312 + 07 .",
    "it is possible that the companion is interacting with the host galaxy of j0312 + 07 , implying that j0312 + 07 may be a young agn triggered in a recent merger . by measuring the difference in redshift in the h@xmath14 emission between j0312 + 07 and the companion galaxy , we have found that the companion is shifted by -240@xmath1320 km s@xmath8 relative to the rest - frame of j0312 + 07 .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably argue that j0312 + 07 is in an interacting system .    * j0400 + 05 * is a type 1 quasar with j - k@xmath1 = 2.00 .",
    "j0400 + 05 is the only object in the 2mass sample with a detectable absorption feature for mgii]@xmath192796,2802 .",
    "figure [ lobal ] shows the fit to the mgii ] absorption feature . from this fit",
    "we deduce that the absorption feature is blueshifted by 1200@xmath13160 km s@xmath8 relative to the rest - frame of the 0400 + 05 narrow line emission , and has a velocity width of 1510@xmath13120 km s@xmath8 ( fwhm ) .",
    "these properties fall short of the lobal properties found for the objects in the @xcite and @xcite samples because bal objects are defined to by blueshifted by @xmath5300025000 km s@xmath8 and have fwhm @xmath4 2000 km s@xmath20 @xcite .    as well as absorption lines ,",
    "the continuum of this object has an unusual shape which includes an unidentified , broad emission feature between 4200 and 5200   in the rest - frame ( see figure [ specs ] ) .",
    "in addition , the blr balmer emission in j0400 + 05 is significantly blue shifted by -2870@xmath13160 km s@xmath8 relative to the nlr emission .",
    "such shifts in the blr are predicted for the recoils ( ` kicks ' ) that result from the merger of two black holes @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the kick can be large : @xcite have computed kicks of up to 3300 km s@xmath8 , but the most extreme kicks require black hole binaries of equal mass and spin , where the spins are extremely high .",
    "we further note that j0400 + 05 has the highest virial black hole mass calculated for the 2mass sample .",
    "we note that @xcite does not detect the presence of the shifted broad line emission in j0400 + 05 ; they classify this object as a type 2 agn .",

    "* j1040 + 59 * is a type 1 seyfert galaxy with j - k@xmath1 = 3.02  far higher than the median near - ir colour of the sample .",
    "in addition to its unusually red j - k@xmath1 colour , the optical continuum of this object rises more steeply to the red than any other object in the sample .",
    "its shape is reminiscent of the object pks 1549 - 79 which also has extremely red colours ( j - k@xmath1=2.82 ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pks 1549 - 79 is believed to be a quasar which is enshrouded in a cocoon of natal gas and dust which is supplied by a recent merger ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "j1040 + 59 also features in the @xcite sample .",
    "consistent with our results , while @xcite found that j1040 + 59 , and many of their objects , are sufciently extinguished such that the broad balmer emission lines are not present at optical wavelengths , broad paschen lines are detected in the near - ir .",
    "* j1057 - 13 : * @xcite classify j1057 - 13 as a liner / hii type object .",
    "however , based on the bpt diagrams ( see figures [ diag1]-[diag3 ] ) , and presence of fhils , we find clear evidence that the emission - line properties of j1057 - 13 are consistent with those of a seyfert type agn .    *",
    "j1131 + 16 * is a type 2 quasar with j - k@xmath1 = 2.15 .",
    "this object has an unusually rich spectrum of fhils , which are strong compared to the [ oiii]@xmath35007 line , and has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "we believe that the unusual strengths of the fhils in this object are due to a specific viewing angle of the far wall of the torus , coupled with a lack of dust on larger scales that might otherwise obscure our view of the torus .",
    "the spectrum of the hot dust emission ( @xmath51500 k ) is expected to peak at wavelengths similar to the k - band .",
    "the enhanced flux in this band could be the explanation for the red j - k@xmath1 colour observed for this object .",
    "* j1307 + 23 * is a type 2 seyfert galaxy / liner with j - k@xmath1 = 3.31 ( the reddest j - k@xmath1 colour in the sample ) and has one of the largest redshifts in the sample ( z = 0.274 ) .",
    "it is possible that this object is a genuine type 2 agn in which the agn is subject to extremely high levels of extinction because the torus is viewed close to edge on , but due to the larger scale of the nlr , shows very little evidence for dust extinction in the narrow balmer decrements .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite report the presence of broad line emission in j1307 + 23 , inconsistent with our analysis of its spectrum . on the other hand",
    ", we note that , like us , @xcite classify this object as a type 2 object .",
    "* j1321 + 13 : * like j1057 - 13 , @xcite classify j1321 + 13 as a liner / hii type object .",

    "* j1637 + 25 * is classified as an intermediate type agn in both @xcite ( type 1.9 ) and @xcite ( type 1.5 ) , however our classification is consistent with the finding of @xcite that this object is a type 2 agn .",
    "* j2124 - 17 * is a type 1 quasar with j - k@xmath1 = 2.37 .",
    "based on the visual inspection of the optical spectrum , this object appears to have an optical sed that is typical of uv / optical selected type 1 quasars .",
    "another notable property of this object is that it has the strongest feii emission of all of the red 2mass sample .",
    "however , a single gaussian fit to the h@xmath21 emission line gives a velocity width fwhm of 2040@xmath1330 km s@xmath8which is higher than expected for a nls1 ( fwhm @xmath0 2000 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "* a note on the comparison of classifications with other work .",
    "* most of the observed differences between agn classifications noted in this section can be explained a by differences in s / n between the studies , or by differences in the method used to fit the h@xmath14+[nii ] blend of the observations , particularly for objects with weak broad lines , or classified as liner / intermediate types ."
