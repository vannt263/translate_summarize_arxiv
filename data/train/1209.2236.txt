    "the class of _ multistable processes _ was introduced in @xcite and further developed and studied in @xcite . these processes",
    "extend the well - known stable processes ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) by letting the stability index @xmath2 evolve in `` time '' . such models are useful in various applications where the data display jumps with varying intensity , such as financial records , eeg or natural terrains : indeed , multistability is one practical way to deal with non - stationarities observed in various real - world phenomena . generally speaking , non",
    "- stationarity is a `` non - property '' , and as such , is hard to model directly .",
    "one approach to tackle this difficulty is to consider processes which are _ localisable _ @xcite .",
    "recall that a process @xmath3 is @xmath4localisable at @xmath5 if there exists an @xmath6 and a non - trivial limiting process @xmath7 such that @xmath8 ( note @xmath7 will in general vary with @xmath5 . ) when the limit exists , @xmath9 is termed the _ local form _ or tangent process of @xmath10 at @xmath5 .",
    "the limit ( [ locform1 ] ) may be taken either in finite dimensional distributions or distribution ( one then speaks of strong localisability ) .",
    "a classical example of a localisable process is multifractional brownian motion @xmath11 which `` looks like '' index-@xmath12 fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) close to time @xmath5 but where @xmath12 varies , that is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is index-@xmath15 fbm .",
    "a generalization of mbm , where the gaussian measure is replaced by an @xmath2-stable one , leads to multifractional stable processes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-local form @xmath7 at @xmath5 , if it exists , must be @xmath15-self - similar , that is @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , as shown in @xcite , under quite general conditions , @xmath7 must also have stationary increments at almost all @xmath5 at which there is strong localisability .",
    "thus , typical local forms are self - similar with stationary increments ( sssi ) , that is @xmath18 for all @xmath5 and @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , all sssi processes are localisable .",
    "classes of known sssi processes include fbm , linear fractional stable motion and @xmath2-stable lvy motion , see @xcite .",
    "localisability provides a convenient way to handle non stationarity : an everywhere localisable process may heuristically be seen as a `` gluing '' of tangent `` simple '' increment - stationary processes , where simple , in this frame , means sssi .",
    "multistable processes are instances of this idea with the tangent processes being lvy stable ones , and the characteristic varying in time being the stability exponent @xmath2 .",
    "although the tangent processes are semi - martingales in this case , there is no reason why the original process will share this property .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to show that , for a simple class of multistables processes , this will indeed be the case . as a consequence ,",
    "such multistable processes are well fitted for applications e.g. in financial modelling or traffic engineering .",
    "three paths have been explored so far to define multistable processes : the first one uses a _ field of stable processes _",
    "@xmath19 , and obtains a multistable process by considering a `` diagonal '' @xmath20 on this field .",
    "this is the approach of @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", multistable processes are obtained from _ moving average processes_. finally , in @xcite , _ multistable measures _ are used for this purpose .    in this work",
    ", we shall be interested only in multistable lvy motions , which are the simplest examples of multistable processes .",
    "these multistable extensions of @xmath21stable lvy motion were constructed in @xcite using respectively poisson and fergusson - klass - lepage representations , while related processes were defined in @xcite by their characteristic functions . in order to give precise definitions ,",
    "let us set the following notation , which will be used throughout the paper :    * @xmath22 \\subset ( 0,2)$ ] is a continuous function .",
    "* @xmath23 is a poisson point process on @xmath24 \\times { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] , @xmath25 , with mean measure the lebesgue measure @xmath26 .",
    "* @xmath27 is a sequence of arrival times of a poisson process with unit arrival time .",
    "* @xmath28 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with uniform distribution on @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "* @xmath29 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with distribution @xmath30 .    the three sequences @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are independent .",
    "the following process , that we shall call _ field - based multistable lvy motion _ , is considered in @xcite : @xmath31}({{\\sf x}}){{\\sf y}}^{<-1/\\alpha(t ) > } \\quad ( t \\in [ 0,t]),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 note that , when @xmath34 equals the constant @xmath2 for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 is simply the poisson representation of @xmath21stable lvy motion , that we denote by @xmath37 .",
    "if one considers instead the fergusson - klass - lepage representation of lvy motion , then it is natural to define @xmath36 as follows :    @xmath38}(v_i ) \\quad ( t \\in [ 0,t]).\\ ] ]    this is the approach of @xcite , where it is proven that and indeed define the same process , and that the joint characteristic function of @xmath36 equals :    @xmath39 } \\int_{0}^{+ \\infty } \\sin^2\\left ( \\sum_{j=1}^{m } \\theta_j \\frac{c_{\\alpha(t_j)}^{1/\\alpha(t_j)}}{2y^{1/\\alpha(t_j ) } } 1_{[0,t_j]}(x ) \\right)\\hspace{0.1 cm } dy \\hspace{0.1 cm } dx \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 .    in @xcite ,",
    "another path is followed to define a multistable extension of lvy motion .",
    "considering the characteristic function of @xmath21stable lvy motion @xmath41 : @xmath42 one defines the process @xmath43 by its joint characteristic function as follows : @xmath44}(s)\\right|^{\\alpha(s ) } ds\\right).\\ ] ]    both @xmath36 and @xmath43 are tangent , at each time @xmath5 , to a stable lvy motion with exponent @xmath45 : @xmath46 as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 or @xmath49 , and convergence is of finite dimensional distributions .",
    "as discussed above , they thus provide flexible models to study phenomena which locally look like stable lvy motions , but where the stability index would evolve in time .",
    "it is clear from this definition that @xmath43 has independent increments ( this is why we call this version the _ independent increments multistable lvy motion _ ) .",
    "this is a strong difference with @xmath36 , which is not even a markov process .",
    "the construction based on multistable measures thus offers the advantage of retaining some properties of classical lvy motion : obviously the increments can not be stationary any more , but we still deal with a pure jump additive process .",
    "this is not the case for the field - based lvy motion ( which is not a pure jump process , see section 3 ) .",
    "however , a drawback of is that , while @xmath36 coincides , at each fixed time , with a lvy motion , this is not true of @xmath43 .",
    "the main aim of this work is to prove that both @xmath43 and @xmath36 are semi - martingales .",
    "this is almost obvious of @xmath43 , but far less so of @xmath36 ( we prove in fact a more general statement , see theorem [ semimgal ] ) .",
    "this property is of crucial importance for the very applications for which multistable processes were designed in the first time , in particular financial modelling : in @xcite , we use this property to analyse a `` stochastic local jump intensity '' model , much in the spirit of classical stochastic volatility models , but where the parameter @xmath2 rather than the volatility evolves in a random way .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : section [ serrep ] elucidates the links between @xmath36 and @xmath43 and provides series representations of @xmath43 .",
    "we prove that both processes are semi - martingales and give their semi - martingales decompositions in section [ semidec ] .",
    "while three characterizations of @xmath36 are known , namely the poisson and fergusson - klass - lepage representations and its characteristic function , only the latter is available for @xmath43 . in this section , we provide the series representation of independent increments multistable lvy motion .",
    "[ propprlii ] @xmath43 admits the following representation in law for @xmath50 $ ] : @xmath51}(x)y^{<-1/\\alpha(x)>}.\\ ] ]    the proof is rather routine .",

    "let us first recall the following result ( theorem 4.14 in chapter ii of @xcite ) :    [ jacshy ] let x be a process with independent increments .",
    "then x is also a semimartingale if and only if , for each real @xmath5 , the function @xmath67 has finite variation over finite intervals .",
    "@xmath43 is a semi - martingale .",
    "let us check that the conditions of theorem [ jacshy ] are fulfilled .",
    "since @xmath43 is an independent increments process , it suffices to verify that the function @xmath68 has finite variations on finite intervals for each @xmath69 .",
    "this is obvious in view of .",
    "it is easy to check that the system of generating triplets ( in the notation of @xcite ) of @xmath43 is @xmath70 , with @xmath71 . if @xmath2 ranges in @xmath72 \\subset(0,1)$ ] , then @xmath43 is a finite variation process , while if @xmath2 ranges in @xmath72 \\subset ( 1,2)$ ] , then @xmath73 , which implies that @xmath43 is a martingale .",
    "the proof is a simple adaptation of the one for stable processes and is left to the reader . in general , the following decomposition holds :    [ semimartingale ] @xmath74 where @xmath75}(x)y^{<-1/\\alpha(x)>}\\ ] ] is a finite variation process and @xmath76}(x)y^{<-1/\\alpha(x)>}\\ ] ] is a martingale .",
    "that @xmath77 has finite variation is a direct consequence of the fact that it is almost surely composed of a finite number of ( jump ) terms .    to prove that @xmath78 is a martingale ,",
