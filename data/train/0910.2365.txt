    "among approximately 400 extrasolar planets discovered as of september 2009 , there are more than 60 transiting planets .",
    "the transiting planets provide important information , such as radii and atmospheric signatures , which are unavailable from radial - velocity data alone .",
    "another advantage of transiting exoplanets is that one can measure the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the orbital axis of the exoplanet projected onto the sky ( conventionally denoted by @xmath0 ) through the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect .",
    "the rm effect generates a radial velocity anomaly during a transit , due to the asymmetric line profiles that result from the partial occultation of the rotating stellar disk @xcite . by carefully investigating velocity anomalies during transits",
    ", one can determine the trajectory of planets on the stellar disk and estimate @xmath0 precisely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this angle is especially important in understanding the basic physical processes of planetary formation and subsequent orbital migration .",
    "according to recent planetary formation theories , gaseous planets orbiting within 0.1 au of the parent star ( hot - jupiters ) are supposed to have formed a few au away from the star , and subsequently to have migrated inward .",
    "while standard migration mechanisms keep @xmath1 , scenarios such as planet - planet scattering may change @xmath0 significantly @xcite .",
    "the kozai mechanism may also lead to a highly inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed distribution of the angles provides an observational clue to distinguish between different planet formation and migration theories .",
    "@xcite derived an analytic formula ( hereafter , the ots formula ) for velocity anomalies due to the rm effect , by computing the first moment ( intensity - weighted mean wavelength ) of distorted absorption lines perturbatively .",
    "( previously , @xcite and others used the first - moment method for eclipsing binary stars to estimate the velocity anomalies . ) the ots formula proved to be useful in understanding the parameter dependence of the velocity anomaly and also in forecasting the error budget of the parameter estimate , in particular of the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath2 . indeed their work inspired @xcite to revisit the estimate of @xmath2 precisely for the first discovered transiting planetary system hd  209458 .",
    "for that purpose , @xcite generated in - transit stellar spectra of hd  209458 , put them into the keck analysis routine of radial velocities , and found that the ots formula systematically underpredicts the velocity anomaly by 10% .",
    "intriguingly , however , @xcite and @xcite , found the ots formula to provide an adequate description of the simulated results for the cases of hat - p-1 and tres-2 .",
    "we noticed that the systematic difference between the ots formula and the simulation may be sensitive to the stellar spin rotation velocity @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denotes the inclination angle of the stellar spin axis ) , which is @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , for the hd  209458 , hat - p-1 , and tres-2 systems , respectively .",
    "in addition , the actual radial velocity measurement algorithm does not adopt the moment method , strictly speaking .",
    "for instance , the analysis routines used by the harps ( the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher ) and sophie ( spectrographe pour lobservation des ph@xmath8nom@xmath9nes des int@xmath8rieurs stellaires et des exoplan@xmath9tes ) teams involve the cross - correlation of the observed spectrum with a template spectrum , and the velocity anomaly is estimated from the peak of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the analysis routine which uses the iodine cell technique , with the subaru hds ( the high dispersion spectrograph ) or keck hires ( the high resolution echelle spectrometer ) , involve a fit to the observed spectra , based on a template spectrum and the known spectrum of the iodine cell .    for these reasons ,",
    "in this paper we revisit the analytic approach to the rm effect using the cross - correlation method .",
    "our analytic approach to this problem is complementary to the recent numerical approach by @xcite , and provides an analytic framework for understanding their results .",
    "even though the cross - correlation method is not directly applicable to the analysis of the iodine cell technique , we find that our result seems to capture the main qualitative features of the numerical results based on that technique ; specifically , our formula includes a term dependent on the stellar spin velocity that does not show up in the moment method but was empirically found by @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our analytical modeling of stellar absorption lines distorted by the occultation due to a transiting planet (  2.1 ) and derives the rm velocity anomaly on the basis of the moment method (  2.2 ) and the cross - correlation method (  2.3 ) . in order to check the reliability of the new analytic formula , we generate simulated spectra during transits and put them into the subaru analysis routine of radial velocities in  3 as @xcite did for the keck routine .",
    "specifically we consider hd  17156 ( @xmath10 ) , tres-2 ( @xmath11 ) , tres-4 ( @xmath12 ) , and hd209458 ( @xmath13 ) systems , and find that our new formula reproduces the simulated data better than the ots formula . finally , section 4 is devoted to a summary and further discussion of the present paper .",
    "in this section , we analytically derive the velocity anomaly due to the rm effect based on the two different methods .",
    "the final result for the moment method is equation ( [ dv ] ) . for the cross - correlation method ,",
    "the key result is equation ( [ gaussiandv ] ) when the stellar line profile and the rotational broadening kernel are approximated by equations ( [ gaus ] ) and ( [ eq : rapproxg ] ) , respectively .",
    "readers who are not interested in the mathematical details of the derivations may simply skip this section and directly move to  3 .      the stellar absorption line profile distorted by the rm effect",
    "is schematically illustrated in figure [ lineprofile ] . during a transit",
    ", a portion on the stellar disk is occulted by a planet , and the flux contribution from the portion occulted by the planet , @xmath14 is subtracted from the stellar absorption line , @xmath15 , yielding a distorted absorption line profile in transit , @xmath16 .",
    "the center of @xmath17 is doppler - shifted by @xmath18 relative to the central wavelength @xmath19 of @xmath20 since the portion occulted by the planet has a stellar rotation velocity : @xmath21 along the line of sight of an observer .",
    "because of the distortion , the absorption line profile becomes asymmetric , producing an apparent velocity anomaly when the radial velocity is estimated using one of the standard techniques .",
    "is a symmetric line profile with respect to the central wavelength of each line @xmath19 over the entire stellar disk outside the transit , while @xmath22 is a symmetric line profile for the portion occulted by a planet that is shifted by a wavelength of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting distorted stellar line profile in transit is given by @xmath24 .",
    "[ lineprofile ] , width=321 ]    let us first write a stellar absorption line profile as a convolution of an intrinsic line profile @xmath25 and a stellar rotation kernel @xmath26 as @xmath27 where the symbol * indicates a convolution , and the continuum level is normalized to unity ( fig .",
    "[ stellarflux ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we implicitly focus on a particular single line of a central wavelength @xmath19 , and locate the center of @xmath28 at @xmath19 .",
    "then we normalize @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that @xmath30    , which is a convolution of the intrinsic stellar line profile ( including the natural broadening ) , @xmath25 and the stellar rotational kernel @xmath31 .",
    ", width=491 ]    a voigt profile ( convolution of a gaussian and a lorentzian ; see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : sgandl ] ] below ) is often used to approximate @xmath25 , but a gaussian profile also provides a reasonable approximation .",
    "we will mainly be concerned with the gaussian approximation in   2.3 .",
    "the function @xmath32 indicates a rotational broadening kernel and broadens the intrinsic stellar line at @xmath19 over the range of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "its expression for a rigid rotating stellar disk can be computed once the limb darkening law is specified ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the quadratic limb darkening law in which the intensity of the stellar disk at a position @xmath36 relative to the center of the star is expressed as @xmath37 in the above expression , @xmath38 is the angle between the line - of - sight and the normal vector to the local stellar surface , @xmath39 is the stellar radius , the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the limb - darkening parameters , and @xmath42 indicates the intensity at the center of the stellar disk .",
    "then we obtain @xmath43 where the coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are given as @xmath47 adopting equation ( [ eq : fstar ] ) as a line profile , the line distortion due to the rm effect is described as follows . in the transiting planetary system ,",
    "the portion occulted by the planet is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the effect of the rotational broadening within the portion is safely negligible , and one can write @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ratio of the flux from the occulted part of the stellar disk to the total flux .    in general , @xmath50 is a function of the position of the planet and the contribution of wavelength shift is determined by integrating over the entire occulted portion of stellar disk .",
    "the precise definition of @xmath51 in terms of the stellar rotation velocity and the position of planet is given by equation ( [ subp ] ) , which is simplified as equation ( [ subp3 ] ) for rigid rotation .",
    "then , the line profile during transit is given as @xmath52 because the continuum level @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : ftransit ] ) does not change the evaluation of the velocity anomaly , in what follows we simply use the expression @xmath54 without losing generality .",
    "let us consider first the moment method , in which we estimate the wavelength shift of the center of a distorted line during a transit as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath55    substituting equation ( [ eq : ftransit ] ) into @xmath56 in equation ( [ moment ] ) , the denominator is @xmath57 the numerator of equation ( [ moment ] ) reduces to @xmath58 and therefore we obtain @xmath59 using equation ( [ eq : vp - deltalambda ] ) , one can rewrite equation ( [ eq : deltarm - moment ] ) in terms of the velocity anomaly as @xmath60 when we explicitly write the flux ratio @xmath49 and the subplanet velocity @xmath51 as a function of the planet position , we reproduce the ots formula ( see appendix [ s : flux ] and [ s : ingress ] below ) . in particular , the above expression coincides with equation ( 25 ) of ots which is the formula for complete transiting case without limb - darkening , if we simply replace the quantities of @xmath49 and @xmath51 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that equations ( [ -1+f ] ) to ( [ eq : deltarm - moment ] ) are derived from the normalization condition ( [ eq : sr - normalization ] ) of @xmath25 and @xmath31 and the fact that they are even functions of @xmath2 , and do not depend on their specific functional forms .",
    "this implies that the velocity anomaly derived from the moment method depends on neither the profile nor the width of the absorption line .",
    "thus the results are independent of the stellar rotation velocity .",
    "consider next the estimate of the velocity anomaly based on the cross - correlation method . in this case , the wavelength shift of central line @xmath63 is obtained by maximizing the cross - correlation function : @xmath64 to proceed further , we have to specify the functional form of @xmath28 and @xmath65 .",
    "here we adopt the voigt profile for the stellar line : @xmath66 in the above expressions , @xmath67 in the gaussian kernel characterizes the thermal and microturbulent broadening , while @xmath68 in the lorentzian kernel represents the line broadening due to natural broadening and the stark effect .    while we derive equation ( [ rotation ] ) for the rotational kernel @xmath32 for the quadratic limb - darkening law , the expression is not analytically tractable . thus we approximate it by a gaussian : @xmath69 where the relation between @xmath70 and @xmath71 is obtained by least - square fitting of gaussian to equation ( [ rotation ] ) .",
    "their explicit relation is given in appendix [ s : leastsquare ] .",
    "under this gaussian approximation for the rotation kernel , we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 this significantly simplifies the analytic computation , and we now have @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 indicate the narrow line originated from the portion of the planet , and thus we simply set @xmath77 .",
    "substituting equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) into equations ( [ deriva ] ) and ( [ cross ] ) , we obtain the following algebraic equation for @xmath63 : @xmath78\\right\\ } \\cr & = \\displaystyle \\frac{f}{b^{3/2}}e^{-(a^2-c^2)/4b } ~\\mathrm{re}\\left\\{(a - ic)e^{iac/2b } \\left[1+\\mathrm{erfi}\\left(\\frac{a - ic}{2\\sqrt{b}}\\right)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 denotes the imaginary error function defined in terms of the error function erf@xmath81 : @xmath82 the derivation of equation ( [ exact ] ) is summarized in appendix [ s : derivation ] .",
    "since the voigt profile is widely used for stellar absorption lines , equation ( [ exact ] ) is fairly general .",
    "while it can not be solved exactly for @xmath83 , we obtain an approximate perturbation solution for @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , we present the result for the gaussian profile ( @xmath85 ) in this subsection , which will be compared with simulated data analysis in  3 .",
    "the other solutions for the lorentzian profile ( @xmath86 ) and the gaussian profile with a small lorentzian wing ( @xmath87 ) are presented in appendix [ s : lorentziansection ] and [ s : perturbation ] , respectively .",
    "in the gaussian profile assumed here , the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 in equations ( [ small ] ) and ( [ large ] ) vanish",
    ". then equation ( [ exact ] ) reduces to @xmath90 or equivalently @xmath91 note that @xmath49 is approximately the square of the planet - to - star radius ratio , and is of order @xmath92 for giant planets .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : deltarm - moment ] ) implies that @xmath93 , and we can expand the exponent in equation ( [ gaussexact ] ) up to the linear order of @xmath83 : @xmath94 in general we consider the case where @xmath23 is well within the width of the stellar broadening , and therefore @xmath95 .",
    "therefore we expand equation ( [ gaussexact ] ) up to the linear order in @xmath96 as @xmath97 and finally obtain @xmath98 as before , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath99 or @xmath100 where we replace @xmath101 with @xmath102 ( line width without rotational broadening ) , and @xmath103 with @xmath104 in which @xmath70 indicates the stellar rotation width",
    ".    equation ( [ gaussiandv ] ) is the key result of the present paper which describes the rm velocity anomaly under the gaussian approximation for the intrinsic line profile and the stellar rotation kernel . in marked contrast to equation ( [ dv ] ) based on the moment method , equation ( [ gaussiandv ] )",
    "indicates that the radial velocity anomaly from the cross - correlation method depends both on the width of the line profile ( @xmath67 ) and on the rotation velocity ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "it recovers the ots formula only when @xmath105 and the second term in the parenthesis is negligibly small .",
    "indeed the presence of the cubic term in @xmath106 is consistent with the empirical finding from the simulated data @xcite .",
    "note that a quintic ( 5th order term ) was needed to match the simulations for the rapidly rotating star hat - p-2 @xcite , which would emerge naturally in our formulation by expanding the next - order term in @xmath107 .",
    "we should note here that in many cases the estimate of the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath2 is not very sensitive to the choice of the moment method or the cross - correlation method discussed in this section ; when @xmath2 is small and the transit impact parameter is not too close to zero , then @xmath2 is mainly determined by the epoch of the photometric central transit when @xmath108 , and thus @xmath51 , vanish .",
    "so far , we have focused on the rm velocity anomaly estimated from single line profiles characterized by the voigt function .",
    "the practical data analysis , however , is much more complicated ; the wavelength shift @xmath23 is estimated statistically from many different lines , and each line is not always approximated by a single voigt profile .",
    "in addition , subaru and keck analysis routines are not related in a straightforward way to the cross - correlation algorithm .",
    "this is why we create mock spectrum data during transit , compute radial velocity anomalies using the subaru analysis routine , and compare the output results with our analytic formulae , in particular equation ( [ gaussiandv ] ) .      in order to check the validity of our analytic formula , we create mock spectra in transit , and reduce the data with the analysis routine @xcite for the subaru hds radial velocity measurement with i@xmath109 cell .",

    "3 .   compute the residual : @xmath120 and use @xmath121 as a revised template for the stellar spectrum .",
    "4 .   iterate the above steps until the given accuracy is achieved .",
    "in general , the above method finds the best - fit stellar template spectrum separately for each @xmath111 observed at different epochs . in order to avoid the contamination caused by the i@xmath109 absorption lines in using only one spectrum , the set of stellar templates at different times",
    "are averaged and the resulting stellar spectrum @xmath122 is used to determine @xmath123 for each @xmath111 .    the keck hires analysis routine by @xcite uses the stellar template spectrum directly obtained from the observed spectrum ( without the i@xmath109 cell ) by deconvolving the instrumental profile that is estimated based on observations of a rapidly - rotating b star using the i@xmath109 cell . except for the treatment of the stellar spectrum , both routines are very similar , and our simulation result below is applicable to the keck data analysis .      as mock observational spectra for the subaru analysis routine ( @xmath111 in eq .",

    "this is presumably due to the fact that apart from the tiny contribution of the tail , the rotation kernel is better approximated as a gaussian for the star with higher rotational velocity ( appendix [ s : leastsquare ] ) .",
    "the fact that the three lines in each figure intersect at the same time ( close to , but not identical to the central transit time time @xmath182 ) indicates that while the difference among the ots formula , the gaussian formula and the simulated result affects the estimate of @xmath3 , the estimated value of the spin - orbit angle is fairly robust as discussed in  2 .",

    "our main finding is equation ( [ gaussiandv ] ) which describes the rm velocity anomaly under the gaussian approximation for the intrinsic line profile and the stellar rotation kernel . unlike the previous approximation ( the moment method ) adopted by ots ,",
    "the radial velocity anomaly from the cross - correlation method is explicitly dependent both on the thermal and natural broadening width of an individual line profile ( @xmath67 ) and on the rotation velocity ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the analytical formula has been compared with the simulated analysis for the subaru hds routine using the mock spectra constructed from the high - resolution spectrum of the sun . even though the actual analysis routine attempts to fit simultaneously many different lines that are not necessarily approximated by gaussians , the resulting rm velocity anomaly is well described by a form of equation ( [ gaussiandv ] ) .",
    "the current result explains the previous findings @xcite that the ots formula does not provide a good approximation to planetary systems with a relatively high stellar rotation rate .",
    "the next step in obtaining a more accurate analytic formula for the rm effect would probably be to use a more accurate rotation kernel ( eq .",
    "[ [ rotation ] ] ) instead of the gaussian approximation ( [ eq : rapproxg ] ) . for future work",
    "we plan to pursue this approach , together with the propagation of the resulting precision on the misalignment angle @xmath2 and the rotation velocity @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the improvement of the analytic approach , the current result points to a possible further refinement of the observational reduction routine for the velocity anomaly due to the rm effect . the procedure described in  3.1 is appropriate for the radial velocity determination _ out of transit_. during the transit , however , the doppler - shifted stellar spectrum @xmath185 in equation ( [ model ] ) should be replaced with @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the stellar template spectrum derived by the procedure described in  3.1 during the out - of - transit data , @xmath188 is obtained by deconvolving @xmath187 with the rotational kernel in principle , and @xmath189 and @xmath190 correspond to the keplerian plus peculiar velocity of the star and the radial velocity of the occulted portion of the stellar disk , respectively .",
    "fitting the observed spectrum _ in transit _ with the additional parameters @xmath49 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , instead of @xmath116 alone , one may directly extract the velocity @xmath191 after averaged over many different lines .",
    "moreover one may reduce the number of fitting parameters by estimating @xmath49 from photometric data during the transit .",
    "since the above method is more appropriate to model the spectra of the transiting planetary system during transit , one expects that the precision and accuracy of @xmath190 , and therefore the rm velocity anomaly , may be improved in principle . in reality , however , the practical feasibility to implement in the analysis routine depends on the available resolution of the spectra as well as their stability .",
    "the work toward this improvement is also currently under way , which we also hope to present elsewhere in due course .",
