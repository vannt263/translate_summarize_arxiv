    "ground - based surveys for extrasolar transiting planets have produced 18 discoveries to date .",
    "this sample is still small enough that individual discoveries often advance our understanding of these objects significantly by pushing the limits of parameter space , either in planet mass , radius , or some other property .",
    "here we announce a new transiting planet , the third to come out of the hatnet survey , around a star previously known as 3 .",
    "it is the smallest yet discovered photometrically , and appears to have a heavy - element content representing a substantial fraction of its mass .",
    "3  is located in our internally labeled field `` g145 '' centered at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which was observed using the 11-cm aperture hat-5 instrument of the hat network ( hatnet ; * ? ? ?",

    "observations over an extended interval of six months ( from 2006 january 28 through 2006 july 22 ) yielded some 3200 photometric measurements per star for approximately @xmath12 stars in the field down to @xmath13 . following standard frame calibration procedures astrometry",
    "was performed as described in @xcite , and aperture photometry results were subjected to the de - trending algorithms we refer to as external parameter decorrelation ( epd , described briefly in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "we searched the light curves for box - shaped transit signals using the bls algorithm of @xcite .",
    "a prominent 2.9-day signal was detected in the @xmath14 magnitude star 3 ( also known as 2mass 13442258 + 4801432 ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; j2000 ) with a transit depth of @xmath17 mag and a dip - significance parameter ( dsp ) of @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "2 full transits were observed . as is shown in the following sections the transiting companion is a jovian planet .",
    "hereafter we refer to the star as hat - p-3 , and to the planetary companion as hat - p-3b .",
    "-0.8 in    the near infrared color of the star ( @xmath19 ) corresponds to an early k dwarf , and the annual proper motion listed in the tycho-2 catalog ( @xmath20 mas  yr@xmath21 , @xmath22 mas  yr@xmath21 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is consistent with this .",
    "the photometric ephemeris was determined by combining all recorded hatnet transit events with a full transit observed more recently at higher precision with a larger telescope , as described below .",
    "the period we obtain is @xmath23 days , and the reference epoch of transit center is @xmath24 ( hjd ) .",
    "we use this ephemeris for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we note that hat - p-3 has a faint ( @xmath25 ) and red ( @xmath26 ) companion at an angular separation of @xmath2710  ( 2mass 13442345 + 4801387 ) , which is entirely within the aperture used for the hatnet photometry .",
    "if this happened to be an eclipsing binary , we estimate , based on the relative fluxes , that 1.6-mag deep eclipses of this star could mimic the observed shallow transits seen in the merged light curve .",
    "however , our follow - up photometry described in  [ sec : followup ] with much better spatial resolution shows that the shallow dips in brightness are indeed present in the light curve of hat - p-3 , whereas the faint companion is constant at the 0.05 mag level .",
    "3  was observed spectroscopically with the flwo 1.5-m tillinghast reflector in order to rule out the possibility that the observed drop in brightness is caused by a stellar companion in an eclipsing binary .",
    "three spectra were obtained with the cfa digital speedometer @xcite over an interval of 25 days .",

    "if the velocities were the result of a blend with an eclipsing binary , we would expect the line bisectors to vary in phase with the photometric period with an amplitude similar to that of the velocities @xcite .",

    "3  was not observed during the _ hipparcos _ mission ) , we have used as a proxy for luminosity ( @xmath49 ) the quantity @xmath59 from the light curve fit , which is closely related to the stellar density ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as described by those authors , @xmath59 is typically a better constraint on @xmath49 than the spectroscopic value of @xmath37 , which has a relatively subtle effect on the line profiles and whose determination is therefore more susceptible to systematic errors .",
    "following @xcite we have determined the range of stellar masses and radii that are consistent with the measured values of @xmath36 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath59 within their uncertainties . based on previous experience , for this application",
    "we have adopted more conservative errors for the spectroscopic quantities of 80  k for @xmath36 and 0.08  dex for [ fe / h ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath80  m@xmath44 and @xmath81  r@xmath44 . the predicted surface gravity , @xmath82 , agrees well with the spectroscopic estimate ( see table  [ tab : stellar ] ) .",
    "the nominal age we infer for 3  is only 0.4  gyr , although the uncertainty is very large due to the unevolved nature of this k dwarf .",
    "while this nominal age would make 3  the youngest known transiting extrasolar planet host star , we note that there is no sign of the  @xmath836708 line in the spectra of 3  down to a factor of @xmath274 lower than the li level in stars of similar spectral type in the hyades cluster , which have an age of @xmath270.7 gyr .",
    "this would suggest an age for 3  greater than 0.7 gyr .",
    "further evidence for an older age is provided by the measured chromospheric activity index of the star based on the h and k lines in the keck spectra : @xmath84 is @xmath85 , indicating an age of @xmath271.3 gyr based on the calibration by @xcite .",
    "combined with the results from the light curve and radial velocity modeling , the above stellar parameters yield a planet mass of @xmath86  m@xmath3 and a radius of @xmath4  r@xmath3 . the surface gravity of the planet , which is independent of the stellar parameters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is @xmath87 ( cgs ) , and is consistent with the @xmath65/@xmath78 relation shown by those authors .",
    "these and other planet properties are listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] .    the absolute visual magnitude we estimate for the star using the stellar evolution models ( @xmath88 ) combined with the apparent visual magnitude ( @xmath89 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yields a distance of @xmath90  pc , ignoring extinction . with this distance estimate we investigated the possibility that the faint 10  companion to 3  mentioned in  [ sec : detection ] is physically associated .",
    "we find that it is not : its @xmath91-band brightness as measured by 2mass is approximately 2 magnitudes fainter than predicted for a star with its @xmath92 color , using the best - fit isochrone to 3 .",
    "it is therefore a background star .",
    "the properties of 3b  place it among the smaller transiting planets discovered so far , and are remarkably similar to those of the recently announced xo-2b @xcite , not only in mass and radius ( reported as 0.57  m@xmath3 and 0.97  r@xmath3 , respectively ) , but also in some of the characteristics of the parent star such as @xmath36 and @xmath43 . in the case of 3b , with a mass of @xmath93  m@xmath3 , the radius measured here appears too small for a pure hydrogen - helium planet according to current theory .",
    "the models for irradiated giant planets by @xcite indicate the radius could be explained by the presence of a heavy - element core of some 75  m@xmath5 ( @xmath6 of the total @xmath75 ) for the nominal mass , orbital semimajor axis , and age we infer , although uncertainties in these properties and in the planetary radius allow the range to be from about 50 to 100  m@xmath5 .",
    "3b  thus joins hd  149026b @xcite as a hot jupiter for which theory predicts a substantial fraction of heavy elements . using the same models and the published properties of xo-2b",
    ", we find that xo-2b is also expected to have a 40  m@xmath5 core representing about @xmath94 of its total mass .",
    "these three heavy - element rich planets , along with others suggested by @xcite , provide important support for the core - accretion scenario of planet formation .",
    "3b  appears consistent with the correlation proposed by @xcite between the host star metallicity and the amount of heavy elements in the planet interior , although there seems to be at least one exception to this relation ( wasp-1b ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to hd  149026b , 3b  has a similar mass of heavy elements but considerably more hydrogen and helium , a feature that will need to be explained by planet formation models .    as of this writing",
    "3b  is the smallest extrasolar transiting planet discovered photometrically .",
    "while hd  149026b and gj  436b @xcite do have smaller radii , they were both originally discovered in doppler surveys before transits were noticed .",
    "@xcite has argued that selection effects in signal - to - noise - limited transit surveys tend to bias the size distribution of close - in giant extrasolar planets toward larger radii , since those objects have deeper transits and are therefore easier to detect .",
    "the fact that the recent discoveries of 3b  and xo-2b are on the small side of the radius distribution would seem to contradict the argument . however , the transit depth in both of these cases is not particularly small ( @xmath271.4% ) , a result of the fact that the parent stars are k dwarfs rather than earlier type stars .",
    "thus , there may still be a bias , although relatively small .",
    "we note also that the properties of 3b  are entirely consistent with the monte carlo simulations of the population of transiting planets by @xcite ( see , e.g. , their fig .",
    "17 ) , as are other recently announced transiting planets .",
    "this supports the idea that these objects are quite representative of the general population of giant planets , and are not significantly different from the doppler planets .",
