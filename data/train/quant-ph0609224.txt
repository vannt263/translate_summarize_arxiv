    "quantum bits ( qubits ) based on polarization or spatial degrees of freedom of optical modes have several advantages : they are easily manipulated and measured ; they exist in a low noise environment and ; they are easily communicated over comparitively long distances .",
    "recently considerable progress has been made on implementing two qubit gates in optics using the measurement induced non - linearities proposed by knill , laflamme and milburn @xcite .",
    "non - deterministic experimental demonstrations have been made @xcite and theory has found significant ways to reduce the resource overheads @xcite . nevertheless , the number of photons and gate operations required to implement a near deterministic two qubit gate remains high .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is the optical quantum zeno gate suggested by franson et al @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "this gate uses passive two - photon absorption to suppress gate failure events associated with photon bunching at the linear optical elements , using the quantum zeno effect @xcite . in principle a near deterministic , high fidelity control - sign ( cz ) gate can be implemented between a pair of photonic qubits in this way",
    ". however , the slow convergence of the zeno effect to the ideal result , with ensuing loss of fidelity , and the effect of single photon loss raises questions about the practicality of this approach .",
    "here we consider a model of the gate that includes the effects of finite two - photon absorption and non - negligible single photon absorption .",
    "we obtain analytic expressions for the fidelity of the gate and its probability of success in several scenarios and show how the inclusion of optical distilling elements  @xcite can lead to high fidelity operation under non - ideal conditions for tasks such as cluster state construction  @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way .",
    "we begin in the next section by introducing our model in an idealized and then more realistic setting and obtain results for a free - standing cz gate . in section 3 we focus on using the gate as a fusion element  @xcite for the construction of , for example , optical cluster states .",
    "we introduce a distillation protocol that significantly improves the operation of the gate in this scenario . in section 4",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "franson et al  @xcite suggested using a pair of optical fibres weakly evanescently coupled and doped with two - photon absorbing atoms to implement the gate .",
    "as the photons in the two fibre modes couple the occurence of two photon state components is suppressed by the presence of the two - photon absorbers via the zeno effect . after a length of fibre corresponding to a complete swap of the two modes a @xmath2 phase difference is produced between the @xmath3 term and the others .",
    "if the fibre modes are then swapped back by simply crossing them , a cz gate is achieved .",
    "we model this system as a succession of @xmath4 weak beamsplitters followed by 2-photon absorbers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ourcsign ] . as @xmath5 the model tends to the continuous coupling limit envisaged for the physical realization .",
    "the gate operates on the single - rail encoding  @xcite for which @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the kets representing photon fock states .",
    "[ fig : cz ] shows how the single rail cz can be converted into a dual rail cz with logical encoding @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 a fock state with @xmath11 photons in the horizontal polarization mode and @xmath12 photons in the vertical .",
    "+    the general symmetric beam splitter matrix has the form :    @xmath13\\ ] ]    according to figure  [ fig : ourcsign ] , after the first beam splitter , the four computational photon number states become : @xmath14      to illustrate the operation of the gate we first assume ideal two - photon absorbers , i.e. they completely block the two - photon state components but do not cause any single photon loss .",
    "propagation through the first pair of ideal two - photon absorbers gives the mixed state @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the evolved two - mode input state obtained for the case of no two - photon absorption event and @xmath17 is the vacuum state obtained in the case a two - photon absorption event occurs .",
    "the individual components of @xmath16 transform as @xmath18    notice that , because we are embedded in a dual rail circuit , we can distinguish between the @xmath19 state that corresponds to input state @xmath20 and the @xmath21 state that results from two - photon absorption of input state @xmath22 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : complete ] ) describes the transformation of each unit , hence repeating the procedure @xmath4 times gives , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }         describing the transformations giving the evolved input state after @xmath4 units , @xmath24 .",
    "there are three conditions to satisfy for building a cz gate .",
    "the first condition is   @xmath25  \" , so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the second condition is  @xmath28 \" ( equivalently , @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 is any integer , so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "phase shifters are needed to correct the sign of the output state of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for odd @xmath30 , but here we simply set @xmath36 .",
    "the last condition is  @xmath37 \" ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , such that a minus sign is induced on @xmath39 .",
    "this condition is always true because we are using many weak beam splitters ( i.e. @xmath40 is small ) .",
    "let @xmath41 , then swapping the fibres gives the transformations @xmath42 ) on the probability amplitude of the @xmath39 state .",
    "if there is some way to herald failure , i.e. two - photon absorption events , then the fidelity of the gate will be @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the target state , and the probability of success will be @xmath45 . on the other hand if two - photon absorption events are unheralded then the fidelity will be @xmath46 .",
    "for simplicity we consider the equally weighted superposition input state @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 after the zeno - cz gate is @xmath48 , to be compared with the target state @xmath49 .",
    "the heralded fidelity and probability of success are then @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "as @xmath4 becomes very large and hence tends to the continuous limit , @xmath52 tends to one , and so both @xmath53 and @xmath54 approach one .",
    "the previous analysis is clearly unrealistic as it assumes infinitely strong two - photon absorption but negligible single photon absorption .",
    "we now include the effect of finite two - photon absorption and non - negligible single photon loss .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be the probability of single photon and two - photon transmission respectively for one absorber . here",
    "the parameter @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the length of the absorber and @xmath59 is the corresponding proportionality constant related to the absorption cross section .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 specifies the relative strength of the two transmissions and relates them by @xmath60 .",
    "now each unit of weak beam splitter and absorbers does the following transformation on the computational states of @xmath61    @xmath62    repeating the procedure @xmath4 times with the aforementioned conditions on @xmath40 gives the following latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }            expression for @xmath52 is given by : @xmath64 and we have suppressed the explicit form of the @xmath65 state components as they lie outside the computational basis and so do not explicitly contribute to the fidelity .",
    "these expressions can be used to calculate the unheralded fidelity , the heralded fidelity and probability of success .",
    "our numerical evaluations are all carried out in the ( near ) continuous limit of large @xmath4 .      for a free - standing gate , as depicted in fig.[fig : cz ] , gate failure events are not heralded , thus the unheralded fidelity is appropriate to consider .",
    "the fidelity is a function of @xmath66 . as the length of the interaction region",
    "is increased ( @xmath66 increased ) the effective strength of the two - photon absorption is increased leading to an improvement in the heralded fidelity , @xmath53 . however , at the same time , the level of single photon absorption is also increasing with the length , acting to decrease the probability of success , @xmath54 . as the unheralded fidelity is @xmath67 , there is a trade - off between these two effects leading to an optimum value for @xmath66 for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "an example of the dependence is shown in fig.[fig : fidelity_vs_lambda ] .",
    "the fidelity is plotted as a function of @xmath0 with @xmath66 optimized for each point in fig.[fig : fidelity_vs_kappa ] . for large ratios of two - photon absorption to single - photon absorption , @xmath0",
    ", we tend to the ideal case of unit fidelity .",
    "however , the conditions required are demanding with absorption ratios of a million to one required for @xmath68 and 100 million to one for @xmath69 .",
    "recent estimates suggest @xmath0 s of ten thousand to one may be achievable  @xcite , well short of these numbers . in the following we will consider a different scenario in which the gate can be usefully employed with less stringent conditions on @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that the requirements on high fidelity operation for the free - standing gate are quite extreme .",
    "we now consider an alternate scenario in which probability of success is traded - off against fidelity by heralding failure events through direct detection .",
    "in particular we consider using the zeno gate to implement the fusion technique @xcite .",
    "fusion can be used to efficiently construct cluster states @xcite , or re - encode parity states @xcite .",
    "we will specifically consider cluster state construction here .",
    "essentially , the gate is used to make a bell measurement on a pair of qubits , as depicted in fig.[fig : fusion ] .",
    "one of the qubits comes from the cluster we are constructing , whilst the other comes from a resource cluster state , in a known logical state .",
    "the bell measurement has the effect of  fusing \" the resource state onto the existing state . by careful choice of the resource state , large 2-dimensional cluster states ,",
    "suitable for quantum computation , can be constructed  @xcite . because the bell measurement ends with the direct detection of the qubits , the loss of one or both of the photons , or the bunching of two photons in a single qubit mode can immediately be identified in the detection record , and hence failure events will be heralded .",
    "effectively we will postselect the density operator @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the component of the output state which remains in the computational basis and @xmath72 are all the components that do not .",
    "the measurement record then allows us to herald the first term of the density operator as successful operation , with fidelity @xmath73 and probability of success of @xmath54 , and the second term as failure .",
    "we now consider techniques for improving the heralded fidelity of the gate and then evaluate its performance as a fusion gate .      from equation  ( [ eqn : incomplete ] )",
    ", we can see that @xmath74 lowers the probability amplitude of the four computational states unevenly as previously discussed by jacobs et al  @xcite . by distilling the states with beam splitters and detectors",
    "@xcite ( see figure  [ fig : cz_distill ] ) , where each beam splitter has a transmission coefficient equal to @xmath75 , the four computational states of @xmath71 become : @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .        as shown previously , after the cz gate and single photon distillation , the input state @xmath47 becomes @xmath80 .",
    "now we require two - photon distillation to renormalise the input state by inducing @xmath52 on the other three computational states as shown in figure  [ fig : two_photon_distill ] . to do so",
    ", we first apply a bit - flip on the control qubit and then apply a @xmath52-gate ( see figure  [ fig : tau_gate ] ) and a single photon distiller on the control qubit with transmission coefficient @xmath81 and another single photon distiller on the target qubit with transmission coefficient @xmath82 and then undo the previous bit - flip by applying another bit - flip on the control qubit .",
    "the @xmath52-gate does the same operation as the aforementioned cz gate ( excluding the single photon distillation ) except that no minus sign is induced on the output of @xmath83 .",
    "the construction of a @xmath52-gate is described in the next subsection . in summary",
    "the two - photon distillation circuit does the following :    @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 .",
    "now the state can be renormalised to achieve unit fidelity _ independent _ of @xmath66 .",
    "the explicit expression for the probability of success is @xmath86 figure  [ fig : two_photon_distill_psuccess ] shows the probability of success of this gate for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "+      we can construct a @xmath52-gate with two 50 - 50 beam splitters , a pair of two - photon absorbers , and some phase shifters , as shown in figure  [ fig : tau_gate ] .",
    "the first beam splitter performs @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the pair of two - photon absorbers then induce @xmath81 on both @xmath34 and @xmath35 due to single photon loss , and induce @xmath90 on @xmath91 due to both single photon and two - photon loss .",
    "the second beam splitter undoes the operation of the first beam splitter . then with some phase shifters to correct the relative phase between the terms and having @xmath92",
    ", we have a @xmath52-gate that does the following operation :      the fusion approach is important because it is the most efficient method known for performing quantum computation using only linear optics .",
    "linear optics allows a partial bell measurement to be made with a probability of success of 50% ( assuming ideal detectors ) .",
    "in addition the failure mode measures the qubits in the computational basis , which does not affect the state of the remaining qubits in the cluster or parity state .",
    "thus a failure event only sacrifices a single qubit from the cluster being constructed and the probability of destroying @xmath94 qubits in the process of achieving a successful fusion is @xmath95 . in contrast , many of the failure events for the zeno gate will simply erase the photon giving no knowledge about its state . for simplicity , and to be conservative , we will assume all events lead to complete erasure of the photon state . in order to recover from this situation the adjoining qubit in the cluster must be measured in the logical basis , thus removing the affect of the erasure @xcite .",
    "this means that every failure event sacrifices two qubits from the cluster being constructed and the probability of destroying @xmath94 qubits in the process of achieving a successful fusion is @xmath96 . requiring @xmath97",
    "we estimate that the zeno gate must have @xmath98 to offer an advantage over linear optics .",
    "+    we can make one final improvement to the set - up by relocating the distillation process for the resource qubit to offline ( see fig.5 ) , which boosts the probability of success . the probability of success is then given by @xmath99 .",
    "the plot for the probability of success versus @xmath0 and optimal @xmath66 versus @xmath0 are shown in figure  [ fig : psuccessvsnoffline ] and figure  [ fig : optimalvsnoffline ] respectively .",
    "+    the break even point between linear optics and the zeno gate is when @xmath100 , such that the probability of success is about @xmath101 . when @xmath102 the probability of success is about @xmath103 .",
    "thus we conclude that an absorption ratio of ten thousand to one or more would produce a zeno gate with significant advantage over linear fusion techniques .",
    "+ * conclusion * + in this paper , we have modelled franson et al s cz gate with a succession of @xmath4 weak beam - splitters followed by two - photon absorbers , in the ( near ) continuous limit of large @xmath4 .",
    "we analysed this cz gate for both the ideal two - photon absorption case and the imcomplete two - photon absorption with single photon loss case , giving analytical and numerical results for the fidelity and probability of success .",
    "the result shows that for a free - standing gate we need an absorption ratio @xmath0 of a million to one to achieve @xmath104 and 100 million to one to achieve @xmath105 , where recent estimate only suggests that @xmath106 may be achievable .",
    "we therefore employ this gate for qubit fusion , where the requirement for @xmath0 is less restrictive . with the help of partially offline one - photon and two - photon distillations",
    ", we can achieve a cz gate with unity fidelity and with probability of success is about 0.87 for @xmath102 .",
    "we conclude that when employed as a fusion gate , the zeno gate could offer significant advantages over linear techniques for reasonable parameters .",
