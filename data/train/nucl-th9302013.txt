    "<S> for simple models of the nuclear charge operator , measurements of the coulomb sum and the charge form factor of a nucleus directly determine the proton - proton correlations . </S>",

    "<S> is that the nuclear charge distribution arises solely from the protons . </S>",
    "<S> as the ppdf is sensitive to the short - range proton - proton correlations , its experimental determination can provide direct information on both the strength of the correlations in the nuclear medium and the size of the repulsive core in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .    </S>",

    "<S> the present analysis differs from that reported in refs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> 20,21 ] in two respects . </S>",
    "<S> first , in ref .  [ 20 ] the tail contribution to @xmath53 is estimated by parameterizing the high-@xmath5 tail of the response as a sum of two decreasing exponentials required to join the data smoothly and to satisfy the calculated energy- and energy - square - weighted sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the values for @xmath51 reported above suggest that the energy - square - weighted sum rule may not exist . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the energy - weighted sum rule has been calculated here with a charge operator that includes both one- and two - body components rather than the proton contribution only as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 20,21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body components ( predominantly that associated with pion exchange ) lead to an enhancement of @xmath46 of 10% ( 6.0% ) , 8.6% ( 4.3% ) , 7.5% ( 3.4% ) in @xmath0h ( @xmath0he ) and 9.1% , 7.8% and 7.4% in @xmath2he at @xmath4 = 300 , 400 , 500 mev / c , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant kinetic energy contribution , which is exactly given by @xmath54 when only protons are included in @xmath50 , is little affected by the relativistic corrections and two - body terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter enhance the leading interaction contributions associated with isospin - exchange spin and tensor components .    as a consequence of these differences , the present analysis yields values for @xmath53 that are slightly larger ( @xmath552% ) than those published in ref .  [ 20 ] for @xmath0h and @xmath0he , the only data for which a comparison is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the final analysis of the bates data on @xmath2he , published in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 10 ] , has given a separated longitudinal response that is somewhat smaller in the quasielastic peak than that used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 20 ] to obtain @xmath56    the experimental lldf obtained for @xmath0h , @xmath0he , and @xmath2he are compared with theory in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 13 . </S>",
    "<S> the errors in the experimental lldf are dominated by those in the coulomb sum . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has two sources : the first , from the measured portion of @xmath53 , denoted as @xmath57 ; the second , from the tail contribution , denoted as @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the error on @xmath57 has been estimated by adding in quadrature the random errors on the measured longitudinal response function and by further assuming the systematic error to be as large as the random error so obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the error on @xmath58 has been estimated by assuming it to be given by @xmath59 @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the experimental error on @xmath6 at @xmath62 ( typically @xmath6320 - 30% of @xmath64 ) .    the theoretical curves in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 - 3 have been obtained by exact monte carlo evaluation of the expectation value in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have used exact faddeev ( a=3 ) and gfmc ( a=4 ) wave functions , again corresponding to the argonne @xmath1 plus urbana viii interaction models . </S>",
    "<S> the lldf obtained from the bates and saclay data on @xmath0he and @xmath2he are consistent with each other , within errors , and are in good agreement with the results of calculations in which both one- and two - body terms are included in the charge operator . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the position of the zero and magnitude of the second maximum are well reproduced by these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained by neglecting the contributions due to the two - body terms or by keeping only the proton contributions in @xmath50 are in poor agreement with the data : the zero is shifted to higher @xmath4 s and the strength in the second maximum is greatly underestimated , as found by beck @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that in the calculation of @xmath0h , @xmath0he and @xmath2he charge form factors , inclusion of the two - body components in @xmath50 is crucial for correctly reproducing the experimental data in the diffraction minimum region . </S>",
    "<S> the minima are located at @xmath4 @xmath65 630 </S>",
    "<S> mev / c in the @xmath0he and @xmath2he charge form factors . </S>",
    "<S> however , they occur at significantly lower momentum , @xmath4 @xmath65 370 mev / c , in the @xmath0he and @xmath2he lldf , thus enhancing the importance of the relativistic and meson - exchange corrections at low momentum transfers .    in @xmath0h </S>",
    "<S> the lldf calculated in the approximation in which only protons are considered vanishes identically . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental lldf extracted from the bates data is different from that obtained in the full calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is also found in the coulomb sum rule : the experimental @xmath53 ( including the tail contribution ) is larger by @xmath63 10% in the @xmath4 = 350500 mev / c range than the theoretical one . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath0h experimental charge form factor is well reproduced by the present theory .    to summarize , the lldf has been calculated in the a = 3 and 4 nuclei with exact faddeev and gfmc wave functions obtained from a realistic hamiltonian containing the argonne @xmath1 two - nucleon and urbana viii three - nucleon interaction models . </S>",
    "<S> the charge operator has been taken to include , in addition to the dominant proton contribution , also the neutron contribution , the darwin - foldy and spin - orbit relativistic corrections , and two - body terms associated with meson exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> within this framework good agreement has been obtained between the calculated and experimental @xmath0he and @xmath2he lldf . however </S>",
    "<S> , large discrepancies remain between the calculated and experimental @xmath0h lldf .    </S>",
    "<S> the present @xmath0he and @xmath2he results indicate that , because of the complicated nature of the coupling between a longitudinal virtual photon and the nucleus ( even at low momentum transfers ) , the lldf extracted from inclusive electron scattering data can not provide direct information on the strength of the proton - proton repulsive interaction at short range . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the experimental evidence based on inclusive longitudinal data for proton - proton short - range correlations remains elusive . </S>"
