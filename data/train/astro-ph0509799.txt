    "we have seen remarkable progress in the understanding of pure dark matter structures over the last few years .",
    "this was triggered by numerical simulations which have observed general trends in the behaviour of the radial density profile of equilibrated dark matter structures from cosmological simulations , which roughly follow an nfw profile  @xcite , ( see diemand et al 2004 for references ) .",
    "general trends in the radial dependence of the velocity anisotropy has also been suggested  @xcite . recently",
    ", more complex relations have been identified , holding even for systems that do not follow the simplest radial power - law behaviour in density .",
    "these relations are first that the phase - space density , @xmath3 , is a power - law in radius  @xcite , and second that there is a linear relationship between the density slope and the anisotropy  ( hansen & moore 2005 , hereafter hm04 ) .",
    "a connection between the shape of the velocity distribution function and the density slope has also been suggested ( hansen et al 2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "using the jeans equation together with the fact that phase - space density is a power - law in radius allows one to find the density slope in the central region numerically  @xcite , and even analytically for power - law densities  @xcite .",
    "recently dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 , hereafter dm05 ) using both the phase - space density being a power - law in radius and also the @xmath0 relation , showed that one can solve the jeans equations analytically and extract the radial dependence of density , anisotropy , mass etc .",
    "the relationship between phase - space density and radius has been considered several times and seems to be well established , however , the other crucial ingredient in the analysis , namely the linear relationship between density slope and anisotropy has only been investigated qualitatively .",
    "we have performed a large set of simulations in order to quantify this relationship .",
    "we show that with present day simulations there does indeed appear to be a linear relation between density slope and anisotropy , which implies zero anisotropy near the density slope of approximately @xmath4 .",
    "we combine our findings with analytical results and find that the outer anisotropy is radial and close to @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0 relation was suggested based on a set of different numerical simulations , including spherical collapse simulations , collisions between initially isotropic nfw structures , merger between two disk galaxies , and finally structures formed in a @xmath6cdm cosmological simulation .",
    "the original relation had a large scatter , and there were several questions not fully answered , such as a possible dependence on shape or initial conditions .",
    "we have here performed controlled experiments to test exactly these points .",
    "the set of experiments are described in glorious detail in a coming publication , and we will not get into these aspects here .",
    "we will only mention , that for each simulation have we extracted all the relevant parameters in radial bins , logarithmically distributed from the softening length to beyond the region which is fully equilibrated .",
    "we calculate the radial derivative of the density ( the density slope ) @xmath7 and the velocity anisotropy @xmath8 in each radial bin , where the @xmath9 are the one dimensional velocity dispersions in the tangential and radial directions respectively .",
    "one of the test we performed was the head - on collision between two initially isotropic nfw structures .",
    "we then took the resulting structures and collided these headon again .",
    "the resulting structure is prolate when observed in density contours .",
    "one may fear that the resulting @xmath0 relation will depend strongly on the axis - ratios of such structures . in order to test this question , we extracted the resulting prolate structure after the first collision described above .",
    "we can now decide to collide this structure along different axes , either along the long , intermediate or short axes .",
    "we perform these 3 different collisions .",
    "we find that there is virtually no difference in the @xmath0 relation for these 3 different simulations .",
    "we conclude from this that whereas the definition of density slope does depend slightly on the shape of the density contours , then the @xmath0 relation is almost independent of the shape .",
    "to address the question of how strongly the @xmath0 relation from the head - on collisions described above depend on the initial conditions , we now perform collisions between structures with different initial degree of anisotropy .",
    "first we make a repeated head - on collision between two isotropic nfw structures .",
    "next we make repeated head - on collisions between two initially strongly radially anisotropic structures . and finally do we perform repeated head - on collisions between initially strongly tangentially anisotropic structures .",
    "we find that the resulting @xmath0 relation is virtually independent of initial conditions , and we conclude that the collisions were sufficiently violent to erase the initial conditions sufficiently to conform with the @xmath0 relation .",
    "in a recent paper , dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) showed , that under the two assumption that phase - space density is a power - law in radius , and that there is a linear @xmath0 relation , that the central slope of dark matter structures must be @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the central anisotropy .",
    "we can now compare this result with our findings , and in figure  [ fig : together2 ] we show the dm05 result for the _ central _ values as a thin ( blue ) straight line .",
    "we see that the two lines cross near @xmath12 and @xmath13 , showing that the central part of dark matter structures is isotropic , and that the central density slope is indeed @xmath14 .",
    "the outer density slope is about @xmath15 @xcite , which when compared with our findings result in @xmath16 .",
    "we have quantified the relationship between the density slope and the velocity anisotropy , the @xmath0 relation .",
    "we have performed a large set of simulations to investigate systematic effects related to shape and initial conditions , and we find that the @xmath0 relation is almost blind to both shape and initial conditions , as long as the system has been _ perturbed sufficiently _ and subsequently allowed to relax . when compared with analytical results we find that the central region is indeed isotropic with a density slope about @xmath17 , and that the outer asymptotic anisotropy is radial , with a magnitude of @xmath18 .",
