    "increasingly efficient perturbative computational techniques for higher - order calculations and increasingly efficient use of integrability of the worldsheet theory in @xmath0 have brought about , in the last few years , remarkable progress in our understanding of @xmath1 super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory and have exposed unexpected and fascinating relations between _ a priori _ unrelated quantities .",
    "such a connection , proposed in @xcite , links gluon scattering amplitudes with the expectation value of certain null polygonal wilson loops in @xmath1 sym theory",
    ". initially suggested at strong coupling based on the ads / cft correspondence , this relation was generalized and successfully tested at weak coupling @xcite as well .",
    "correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators are natural observables in a conformal field theory such as @xmath2 sym theory .",
    "two - point functions are determined by the dimension of the operators ; since the latter are known , at least in principle , through use of integrability , so are the two - point functions .",
    "apart from the dimension and @xmath3 charges of operators , three point functions are determined by additional coupling - constant dependent `` structure functions '' whose evaluation is less clear .",
    "it is possible to argue that , if some of the operators carry large quantum numbers , the calculation can be carried out in a semiclassical expansion @xcite .    even though the axioms of conformal field theories guarantee that higher - point correlation functions are determined by the two- and three - point functions , an explicit evaluation along this line is not straightforward .",
    "it is therefore interesting to devise methods to directly evaluate them either for generic position of operators or in special limits .",
    "it was recently suggested @xcite that the duality between wilson loops and scattering amplitudes can be extended to include certain special classes of correlation functions .",
    "more precisely , for operators in the stress tensor multiplet , the following relation should hold in the planar limit : _",
    "x_i , i+1 ^ 20 = = [ allks ] where @xmath4 is a null polygonal wilson loop with corners at positions @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "initially proposed as a relation between correlation functions of bosonic operators , bosonic wilson loops and mhv amplitudes , this triality conjecture was extended to supersymmetric correlators , supersymmetric wilson loops and generic superamplitudes @xcite .",
    "this relation was proven at the level of the unregularized integrand in @xcite and shown to hold in explicit examples @xcite in the presence of a dimensional regulator .",
    "it was moreover suggested and explicitly demonstrated for four - point correlation functions though two - loop order @xcite that the relation ( [ allks ] ) is not restricted to operators in the tensor multiplet , but rather holds for more general 1/2-bps operators , including operators with large quantum numbers .",
    "another class of interesting observables is provided by the correlation function of wilson loops and local operators .",
    "such quantities are interesting for several reasons .",
    "for example , they characterize the expansion of a wilson loop in local operators = _ ic_i ( ) o_i(x )  ; the coefficients @xmath7 may be found in the obvious way in terms of the correlation function @xmath8 and the two - point function @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , they may be used to factorize the expectation value of a product of two wilson loops or , if the coefficients @xmath7 are known , to simply evaluate this expectation value : & = & _ i , jc_i()c_j( ) _ i(x)o_j(y)&=&_ic_i ( ) _ i(x ) w()&=&_i , j_ij(x - y)w()o_i(x ) _",
    "j(y ) w( )  , [ factorization ] where @xmath10 are the relevant conformal blocks .",
    "a second motivation for analyzing correlation functions of wilson loops and local operators is that , for a special choice of operator ( given by the chiral lagrangian ) , they contain information about the higher - loop corrections to the expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "this is akin to the lagrangian insertion formalism @xcite used in @xcite to evaluate loop corrections to correlation functions of local operators in the null separation limit .",
    "a generalization of the relation between correlation functions of operators and null polygonal wilson loops was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , starting with an @xmath11-point correlation function and taking the limit in which @xmath12 points are sequentially null - separated one should find that _ x_ii+1 ^ 20 ~ [ abt ] where the expectation values on the right - hand side are taken in the fundamental representation .",
    "non - vanishing values for both correlators , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , require that the total r - charges of the product of operators in the two correlators are zero .",
    "it therefore follows that the operator @xmath15 must have vanishing r - charges.@xmath16 , the correlation function acquires the interpretation of form factor at zero momentum .",
    "indeed , it was argued in @xcite that form factors may be interpreted in terms of the expectation value of certain zig - zag wilson loops . if the position of the operator is integrated over , _",
    "i.e. _ if the momentum inflow though it vanishes , the zigzag wilson line becomes closed .",
    "]    generalizations of ( [ abt ] ) are fairly straightforward to formulate . for example , _",
    "x_ii+1 ^ 20 ~ [ ww ] where the upper index denotes a restriction to the connected part of the correlation functions and the points @xmath17 with @xmath18 are generic .",
    "one may moreover consider a second limit in which the points in this set become sequentially null separated while remaining at generic positions with respect to the points @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in this limit",
    "the original correlation function equals the correlation function of two null polygonal wilson loops",
    ".    ratios of the type ( [ abt ] ) , ( [ ww ] ) are good observables .",
    "indeed , as discussed in detail in @xcite , in the null limit correlators develop the same type of singularities as null polygonal wilson loops .",
    "since these divergences are located around the wilson loop cusps or , alternatively , around the operators that are sequentially null separated , in the ratios ( [ abt ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) these divergences cancel out leaving behind a finite quantity , which should exhibit the symmetries of the theory . in particular , the conformal symmetry of the correlation functions should be realized .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether the additional operator insertions in eqs .",
    "( [ abt ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) have any interpretation in terms of scattering amplitudes when the operators position is not integrated over .    here",
    "we will prove , to all orders in a weak coupling expansion and in the regularized theory with @xmath19 and take the null separation limit for generic @xmath20 . since we will keep the complete @xmath20 dependence , our arguments hold in all dimensions .",

    "we will also discuss two - field operators outside this class , containing fermions and field strengths .",
    "while not identical in details , our strategy will be similar in spirit with the eikonal line arguments used in @xcite ; we will separate the feynman diagrams contributing to correlation functions into classes depending on whether or not there exists r - charge flow between operators and show that certain sequences of propagators between null - separated points are equivalent to null wilson lines .",
    "we will also show that diagrams in which there is no r - charge exchange between charged fields at null - separated points have softer singularities than if r - charge flow is present .",
    "we will then extend these arguments to larger classes of operators and also to larger classes of correlation functions , in which not all points are sequentially null - separated ; we will refer to them as `` partial null limits '' .",
    "we will also see that the relation between correlation functions in the null separation limit and the expectation value of null polygonal wilson loops is not restricted to four - dimensional gauge theories but rather holds in all dimensions .",
    "the arguments in this note point to a generalizations of ( [ abt ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) to limits in which any operator is null - separated from at least one and at most two other operators . in this limit",

    "the proportionality coefficient depends on the regularization scheme and on the order of limits .",
