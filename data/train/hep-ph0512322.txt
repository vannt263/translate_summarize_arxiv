    "@xmath0 is low , so the basic expansion parameter of bound state qed , @xmath2 , is a small quantity . for this reason techniques in which the smallness of this parameter is exploited",
    "have been refined in sophistication over the years , culminating in the present widespread use of effective field theories such as nrqed @xcite and the effective hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "however , at the same time experiments of increasing precision have been carried out on both highly charged hydrogenlike ions and also ions with more electrons , where as an example of the accuracy achieved at the highest @xmath0 we note the recent determination @xcite of the @xmath3 transition energy in lithiumlike uranium , @xmath4 as the expansion parameter @xmath2 is no longer small in this case , techniques in which an expansion in it is avoided are necessary . in the non - recoil limit , in which the nuclear mass is taken to infinity ,",
    "furry representation qed @xcite allows a systematic feynman diagram based treatment of highly charged ions .",
    "a central structure in this approach is the electron propagator in a coulomb field , the dirac - coulomb propagator , which satisfies the equation @xmath5   s_f(\\vec x , \\vec y ; e ) = \\delta^3 \\left ( \\vec x- \\vec y \\right ) .",
    "\\label{diraccoulombprop}\\ ] ] as first pointed out by wichmann and kroll @xcite for the vacuum polarization , and by brown , langer and schaefer @xcite for the self energy , treating this propagator exactly using numerical methods allows a determination of the lamb shift that automatically accounts for all orders of an expansion in @xmath2 .    when applied to lithiumlike uranium , use of this propagator",
    "gives a one - loop lamb shift contribution ( including screening corrections ) to the @xmath3 splitting of -41.793 ev , which when combined with the nonradiative energy shift of 322.231 ev leaves a 0.207 ev discrepancy with experiment .",
    "this can be used to infer the two - loop lamb shift , which has recently been calculated for the ground state of hydrogenic ions @xcite , but before this can be done recoil terms , the subject we wish to address in this paper , must be reliably calculated .",
    "recoil effects have of course been treated for low @xmath0 atoms , but again the techniques can not be directly extended to high @xmath0 ions . the general level of treatment of these small corrections in this latter case is to scale the overall energies by a factor of @xmath6 , where the reduced mass @xmath7 is defined in the usual way in terms of the electron mass @xmath8 and the nuclear mass @xmath9 , @xmath10 this has a relatively small effect for the transition we are discussing , amounting to only -0.006 ev , below the experimental error .",
    "a larger effect comes from the mass - polarization operator , @xmath11 when this term is evaluated in a realistic potential it contributes -0.081 ev , for a total lowest order effect of -0.087 ev , 42 percent of the discrepancy . to accurately infer the two - loop lamb shift , a more sophisticated treatment of recoil effects",
    "is clearly needed .",
    "the only such treatment we are aware of is that given by shabaev @xcite and collaborators @xcite , who in fact find significant corrections to the above result .",
    "the present paper is intended to lay the groundwork for an alternative approach .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the hydrogen isoelectronic sequence , and in addition restrict our attention to diagrams that contribute in the low @xmath0 case to order @xmath12 , leaving the treatment of a more complete set of diagrams , along with the treatment of the many - electron problem , for a later paper .    while considerable progress has been made in qed in recent years with the use of effective field theories , these rely on expanding around the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation , which , as just discussed , is not appropriate for highly charged ions .",
    "however , the bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite , introduced first to treat the binding of the deuteron and shortly afterwards applied to the atomic problem by salpeter @xcite , allows the problem to be treated in a systematic manner .",
    "however , this equation is famously difficult to apply , and most applications rely on expanding around the nonrelativistic limit , which we wish to avoid .",
    "the treatment given by shabaev is fairly complicated , and we wish to provide a cross check by introducing as simple a formalism as possible .",
    "this can be done by slightly modifying a formalism introduced by lepage @xcite , and it is this approach we will now describe .    the plan of the paper is to set up in the following section a three - dimensional formalism equivalent in rigor to the bethe - salpeter equation . in the next section",
    "the one and two photon exchange diagrams that contribute to order @xmath12 will be evaluated in coulomb gauge , and their nonrelativistic limit will be taken .",
    "this will be followed by a nrqed treatment , and in the conclusion we will describe how a calculation relevant to highly charged ions can be carried out .",
    "it has been known for quite some time @xcite that there is an arbitrary number of bound state equations equivalent in rigor to the original form of the bethe - salpeter equation , but that are effectively three - dimensional .",
    "many practical calculations have used formulations that also incorporate the schrdinger equation @xcite , @xcite . however , for the problem we are considering a relativistic approach is demanded .",
    "we note that a fairly detailed discussion of a number of notational and formal issues involved with the use of three - dimensional forms of the bethe - salpeter equation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader interested in more detail .",
    "the spectrum of many high-@xmath0 ions has been studied , and it would be impractical to consider the differing spins of each nucleus .",
    "for this reason we simply treat the nucleus as a spinless particle of charge @xmath13 .",
    "the feynman rules for the electrodynamics of a spin-0 particle involve the coupling @xmath14 for the one - photon vertex , and @xmath15 for the seagull vertex .",
    "the @xmath16 component of the one - photon vertex for a nucleus close to mass shell will then be dominated by the factor @xmath17 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the nucleus .",
    "hyperfine effects associated with nuclear spin can be treated separately .",
    "we can also model the finite size of the nucleus by replacing the nuclear charge @xmath0 with a form factor @xmath18 if desired , but this will not be done in this paper .",
    "we now consider the truncated two - particle green s function for the scattering of an electron and nucleus .",
    "we define the initial and final electron three - momenta as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , and work in the center of mass so that the corresponding nuclear momenta are @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for the fourth component of momentum",
    "we choose @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the electron line and @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the nuclear line , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be chosen close to the electron and nuclear masses , and when the total center of mass energy @xmath29 is a bound state energy a pole will be present .",

    "our method will lead to a dirac equation with reduced mass @xmath7 in that limit .",
    "we note that this method of building in the reduced mass is relatively simple , in particular requiring no rescaling of coupling constants .",

    "@xcite , in which a delta function that puts the nucleus on mass shell is chosen .",
    "while the latter choice has a number of advantages when feynman gauge is used , we use coulomb gauge in this calculation , and putting the nucleus on - shell is not needed . at this point",
    "we can go to a completely three - dimensional formalism by choosing @xmath58 , a choice that has no effect on the location of the bound state poles , and which allows us to replace the four vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this case eq .",

    "for example , the ground state wave function is @xmath221 where @xmath222 with @xmath223 and , for example , @xmath224 .",
    "the relevant graphs for the calculation of energies up to @xmath225 and including recoil ( to first order : @xmath187 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the calculation of bound state nrqed graphs",
    "we take the electron line to enter with momentum @xmath226 and the nucleus with momentum @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the bohr energy level .    the crossed coulomb ladder ( fig .",
    "4a ) has the form @xmath229 the poles of the @xmath192 integral @xmath230 are both on the same side of the real axis .",
    "it follows that the @xmath192 integral vanishes , as does the crossed coulomb ladder contribution : @xmath231 .    the relativistic kinetic energy correction ( fig .",
    "4b ) is @xmath232 where @xmath233    the spin - orbit correction to the electron line ( fig .",
    "4c ) is @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath236 as before .",
    "the darwin correction to the electron line ( fig .",

    "4e ) is @xmath239 just as in the relativistic calculation of one transverse photon exchange .",
    "we note that the expectation value @xmath240 can be written as @xmath241    finally , the fermi correction ( fig .",

    "a form of the bethe - salpeter equation of particular simplicity has been introduced that can be applied to the entire hydrogen isoelectronic sequence .",
    "we have shown that the power series expansion of the 1 t kernel is nonperturbative at high @xmath0 , demonstrating the need for a complete numerical calculation for all kernels .",
    "such a calculation has been done using a green s function formalism by shabaev and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , but it is always desirable in qed to have checks on these complex calculations .",
    "we are presently calculating the remaining one - loop diagrams that enter in order @xmath244 . as an indication of the numerical importance of these calculations for the transition discussed in the introduction",

    "@xcite finds a correction of -0.04 ev for the @xmath245 transition in hydrogenic uranium , to be compared to the 0.207 ev discrepancy presumably dominated by the two - loop lamb shift .",
    "however , this is only part of the effect of recoil for lithiumlike uranium , and the question of relativistic corrections to mass polarization can not be addressed in our formalism , which is strictly a two - body approach .",
    "we are presently investigating the relatively unexplored problem of forming many - particle generalizations of the bethe - salpeter equation that have the three - dimensional and relativistic aspects of the equation described in the present work .",
