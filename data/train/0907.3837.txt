    "a common problem in statistical genomics is how to organize expression data from genes that have been determined to exhibit differential expression relative to various cellular states .",
    "cells in a time - course experiment may exhibit such genes , as may cells in any sort of designed experiment or observational study where expression alterations are being examined ( e.g. , parmigiani _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; speed , 2004 ) . in the event that the error - rate - controlled list of significantly altered genes is small , the post - processing problem amounts to inspecting observed patterns of expression , investigating what is known about the relatively few genes identified , and planning follow - up experiments as necessary .",
    "however , it is all too common that hundreds or even thousands of genes are detected as significantly altered in their expression pattern relative to the cellular states .",
    "post - processing these non - null genes presents a substantial statistical problem .",
    "difficulties are compounded in the multi - group setting because a gene can be non - null in many different ways ( jensen _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) .    ever since eisen _",
    "( 1998 ) , clustering methods have been used to organize expression data .",
    "information about a gene s biological function may be conveyed by the other genes sharing its pattern of expression .",
    "( 2006 ) provides a recent perspective .",
    "clustering methods are often applied in order to partition non - null genes which have been identified in differential expression analysis ( e.g. , campbell _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ; grasso _ et al .",
    "popular approaches are informative but not completely satisfactory .",
    "there are idiosyncratic problems , like how to select the number of clusters , but there is also the subtle issue that the clusters identified by most algorithms are anonymous : each cluster is defined only by similarity of its contents rather than by some external pattern that its genes may be approximating .",
    "anonymity may contribute to technical problems , such as that the objective function being minimized is not convex , and that realized clusters have a more narrow size distribution than is warranted by the biological system .",
    "model - based clustering treats data as arising from a mixture of component distributions , and then forms clusters by assigning each data point to its most probable component ( e.g. , titterington _ et al . _ 1985 ; mclachlan and basford , 1988 ) . for example , the ` mclust ` procedure is based on mixtures of gaussian components ( fraley and raftery , 2002 ) ; the popular ` k - means ` algorithm is implicitly so based ( hastie _ et al . _ , 2001 ,",
    "page 463 ) .",
    "there is considerable flexibility in model - based clustering , though technical challenges have also affected its development : the likelihood function is often multi - modal ; identifiability can be difficult to establish ( e.g. , redner and walker , 1984 ; holzmann _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) ; and even where constraints may create identifiability , there can be a problem of label - switching during bayesian inference ( stephens , 2000 ) .",
    "some sophisticated model - based clustering methods have been developed for gene expression ( e.g. , medvedovic _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) . beyond empirical studies",
    "it is difficult to determine properties of such approaches , and their reliance on monte carlo computation is somewhat limiting .    here a model - based clustering method is developed that aims to support multi - group gene - expression analysis and possibly other applications .",
    "the method , called gamma ranking , places genes in a cluster if their expression patterns commonly approximate one element from a finite catalog of possible structures , in contrast to anonymous methods ( section  2 ) . under certain conditions the component distributions are linearly independent functions ",
    "each one associated with a structure in the finite catalog  and this confers favorable computational characteristics to the gamma - ranking procedure ( sections 4,5 ) .",
    "the cataloged structures record patterns of equality and inequality among latent expected values . where normal - theory specifications seem to be intractable , a gamma - based mixture model produces closed formulas for all necessary component densities , thanks to an embedding of the relevant gamma - distributed variables in a set of poisson processes ( section  3 ) .",
    "the formulation also extends to poisson - distributed responses that are characteristic of gene expression measured by next - generation sequencing ( section 6 ) .",
    "the data considered has a relatively simple layout . each gene @xmath0 from a possibly large number is associated with a vector @xmath1 holding measurements of gene expression from @xmath2 distinct biological samples .",
    "the @xmath2 samples are distributed among @xmath3 different groups , which represent possibly different transcriptional states of the cells under study .",
    "the groups may represent cells exposed to @xmath4 different chemical treatments , cells at @xmath4 different developmental stages , or cells at @xmath4 different points along a time course , for example .",
    "the layout of samples @xmath5 is recorded in a vector , say @xmath6 , with @xmath7 indicating that sample @xmath8 comes from group @xmath9 .",
    "this is fixed by design and known to the analyst ; to simplify the development we suppress @xmath10 from the notation below except where clarification is warranted .",
    "each expression measurement @xmath11 is treated as a positive , continuous variable representing a fluorescence intensity from a microarray , after pre - processing has adjusted for various systematic effects not related to the groupings of interest .",
    "recent technological advances allow expression to be measured instead as an explicit abundance count .",
    "the mixture model developed below adapts readily to this case ( section 6 ) .",
    "gamma ranking entails clustering genes according to the fit of a specific model of gene - level data .",
    "the joint probability density for a data vector @xmath12 , denoted @xmath13 , is treated as a finite mixture over a catalog of discrete structures @xmath14 , each of which determines ordering constraints among latent expected values .",
    "more specifically , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a mixing proportion and the component density @xmath17 is determined through modeling .",
    "each @xmath14 is a partition of group labels @xmath18 , containing @xmath19 subsets , that also carries an ordering of these subsets .",
    "for example , three structures cover the two - group comparison , denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the notation conveys both the partition of group means and the ordering of subsets within the partition .",
    "for instance , in @xmath21 the expected expression level in group @xmath22 is less than that of group @xmath23 ; while @xmath24 indicates that both groups share a common latent mean .",
    "with @xmath25 groups there are 13 structures , @xmath26 and the number grows rapidly with the number of groups ( table  [ tab0 ] ) . a way to think about @xmath27 , the catalog of these ordered structures on @xmath4 groups , is to imagine @xmath4 real values @xmath28 and the possible vectors you would get by ranking @xmath29 . of course there are @xmath30 rankings if ties are not permitted , but generally there are far more rankings , and @xmath31 is in 1 - 1 correspondence with the set of rankings of @xmath4 numbers , allowing ties .",
    ".the number of ordered structures , bell@xmath32 , as a function of the number of groups , @xmath4 .",
    "this is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are stirling numbers of the second kind .",
    "the bell number of partitions of @xmath35 is included for comparison .",
    "[ tab0 ] [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for all data sets we examined quantile - quantile plots and plots relating sample coefficient of variation to sample mean .",
    "some model violations were noted , but largely the gamma observation model was supported .    for the edwards data we re - ran the em algorithm for 10 cycles and updated shape parameter estimates via 2-d grid search in each cycle .",
    "estimated shapes changed slightly ; 784/786 genes received the same bayes s rule cluster assignment .",
    "computations were done in r on industry - standard linux machines . for the data sets analyzed , run times ranged from 6 to 860 cpu seconds per em iteration , with a mean of 270 seconds .",
    "run time is affected by the number of genes analyzed , the number of groups , and also the shape parameters and sample sizes .",
