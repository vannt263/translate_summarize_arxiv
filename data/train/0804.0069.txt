    "the transition to turbulence has its genesis to the growth of small disturbances in an otherwise undisturbed laminar flow .",
    "hence , an understanding of different mechanisms of instability growth is important to determine the transition scenarios that eventually lead to turbulence in fluids . the linear stability theory , via the standard normal - mode approach , is the starting point of such analyzes which predict the onset of the growth of a small perturbation imposed on a laminar flow  @xcite .",
    "however , there are flow configurations that are stable according to the linear stability theory ( i.e. , the critical reynolds number is infinity , @xmath8 ) for which the experiments show a finite @xmath9 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such sub - critical flows may be destabilized by the nonlinear effects that are neglected in the linear theory .",
    "is there any linear mechanism that causes an infinitesimally small perturbation already present in the flow to grow substantially for a short time ?",
    "if this is true , then the nonlinearities could take over subsequently to trigger a flow - transition .",
    "indeed , following the seminal work of orr  @xcite , it has recently been realized that one should investigate the short - time dynamics of the flow without _ a priori _ assuming the exponential time - dependence for perturbations .",
    "the key idea is that even though each eigenmode decays in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath10 ) for a _",
    "stable _ flow , a superposition of such stable eigenmodes has potential for large _ transient _ energy growth before they can be stabilized by the viscosity .",
    "such transient growth analyzes @xcite have revealed that a flow can sustain large amplification of perturbation energy even if the flow is linearly stable . in mathematical terms , the underlying linear stability operator is non - normal ( non - self - adjoint )  @xcite which is responsible for transient energy growth .",
    "this is a possible route to flow transition for subcritical flows which has become an active field of research during the last ten years  @xcite .",
    "it is known that small changes in the mean - flow can be stabilizing or destabilizing which is an attractive avenue from the viewpoint of controlling or manipulating instabilities .",
    "a recent work  @xcite clearly underscores the effects of mean - flow variation on the stability of _ incompressible _ plane couette flow using the concept of pseudo - spectra  @xcite , these authors showed that relatively small changes in the mean flow could be _ destabilizing_.",
    "another important issue in stability research is the possible role of viscosity stratification on instabilities which has a stabilizing effect , leading to a delayed transition . in incompressible non - newtonian fluids ,",
    "the role of viscosity - stratification in delaying transition is currently debated for which we refer to a recent work  @xcite .",
    "the above issues have not been investigated for _ compressible _ fluids in a systematic manner . in this paper ,",
    "the linear stability characteristics and the non - modal transient energy growth in the compressible plane couette flow are analyzed for two prototype model problems : ( a ) uniform shear flow with constant viscosity , and ( b ) nonuniform shear flow with stratified viscosity .",
    "first _ goal of the present work is to understand the similarities and differences of the modal and nonmodal stability characteristics between these two closely related mean flows of a compressible fluid .",
    "the _ second _ goal is to reveal the role of _ viscosity - stratification _ on instabilities in a _",
