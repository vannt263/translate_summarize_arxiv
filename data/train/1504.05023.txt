    "a lower bound on the tree - level cross - section was derived in @xcite which corresponds to an upper bound on the absolute value of @xmath99 .",

    "the fact that @xmath103 implies , @xmath104 an often quoted misreading of this result is the statement that perturbative cross - sections remain unobservable in the multi - particle limit , even at infinitely high energies , due to a rising with @xmath0 exponential suppression factor @xmath105 .",
    "this , of course , is not the case as the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] and [ fig : f6 ] demonstrate : the growing function @xmath106 compensates the suppression in @xmath105 for any @xmath22 already at moderately high values of @xmath2 .",

    "we leave this to future work .    since in our case",
    "the calculations are carried out within the first principles perturbative approach , we also know that as soon as the regime is reached where the theory breaks down and violates unitarity , this implies that we really are falsifying the perturbative technique itself , and not a bound arising from a semi - classical treatment .",

    "[ fig : f5 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] by an order of magnitude , has been derived only in the multiparticle threshold limit ; the fool @xmath22-dependence of leading loop corrections remains unknown .",
    "another ( perhaps less crucial ) technical limitation of our simple derivation is that we have concentrated only on sub - processes with a single virtual higgs in the s - channel in .",
    "we have not considered here the effect of possible numerical partial cancellations between the s - channel @xmath108 and box diagram processes @xmath109 and in the double higgs case and generalisations for the multi - higgs case , see e.g. the discussion in @xcite . however , in the absence of the symmetry reason , we do not expect that such partial cancellations could significantly modify the exponential growth of the @xmath110-channel processes .",
    "this conclusion is also n agreement with the discussion in section 4 of @xcite where we have seen that the exponential growth persists in the similar case of the weak vector boson fusion , @xmath111 vs @xmath112    we have shown that in very high energy scattering events , perturbative rates for production of multiple higgs bosons grow with increasing energy , eventually violating perturbative unitarity and resulting in the breakdown of the ordinary weakly - coupled perturbation theory",
    ". the energy scales where electro - weak processes can enter this regime are potentially within the reach of the 100 tev future hadron colliders , or at least not much above it .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that novel physics phenomena must set in before these energies are reached : either the electroweak sector becomes non - perturbative in this regime , or additional physics beyond the standard model might be needed .",
