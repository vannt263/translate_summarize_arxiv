    "although gutzwiller investigated also integrable systems such as the kepler problem in his series of papers @xcite beginning in the late 1960s , the break through of his semiclassical theory came with the trace formula for isolated orbits , published in the last paper , whose 30th anniversary we are celebrating this year .",
    "this trace formula is most suited for chaotic systems in which all periodic orbits are unstable .",
    "it has , indeed , launched the success of the periodic orbit theory ( pot ) for the semiclassical description of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "shortly after gutzwiller , balian and bloch @xcite published a trace formula for particles in two- and three - dimensional billiards with ideally reflecting walls , which may be integrable or non - integrable .",
    "the spherical cavity investigated by them found a beautiful physical realization in the ` supershell ' structure of metal clusters @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "berry and tabor first derived @xcite a general trace formula for integrable systems starting from ebk quantization  a precursor of their approach may be found in @xcite  and then showed @xcite that it could also be derived from gutzwiller s semiclassical green function .",
    "however , most physical systems are neither integrable nor chaotic , but have mixed classical dynamics . when a continuous ( dynamical or spatial ) symmetry is present , the periodic orbits appear in degenerate families and are no longer isolated . starting in 1975 , strutinsky and collaborators @xcite generalized",
    "gutzwiller s approach to take into account such symmetries by performing some of the trace integrations exactly ( instead of using the stationary - phase approximation ) .",
    "these authors also pioneered the idea of employing the pot not for semiclassical quantization but for describing _ gross - shell quantum effects _ in mean - field systems in terms of their _ shortest periodic orbits _ @xcite .",
    "for that purpose they derived trace formulae not only for the level density , but also for the energy shell - correction @xmath0 ( i.e. , the oscillating part of the total energy of an interacting system ; see also @xcite for details ) .",
    "a more general , and mathematically quite elegant , technique of deriving trace formulae for systems with continuous symmetries ( including integrable systems ) was developed in the early 1990s by creagh and littlejohn @xcite .",
    "they transformed ( part of ) the trace integral in the phase - space representation to an analytical integration over the haar measure of the symmetry group that characterizes the degenerate orbit families .    with this , trace formulae are available covering all situations from fully integrable to fully chaotic systems .",
    "the leading amplitudes in a trace formula ( i.e. , those with the lowest order in @xmath1 ) come from the most degenerate orbit families @xcite ; less degenerate orbits contribute at higher orders in @xmath1 .",
    "this leads us to the next problem : when the variation of a continuous system parameter ( energy , deformation , strength of an external field , etc . )",
    "causes the breaking or restoring of a symmetry , the leading - order amplitudes change discontinuously and diverge at the critical points .",
    "the same happens when periodic orbits undergo bifurcations , which is inevitable in a system with mixed dynamics .",
    "both phenomena are closely related and , technically speaking , come from the break down of the stationary - phase approximation at the critical points . these divergences can be removed by going beyond the first - order saddle - point approximation @xcite , which results in local uniform approximations @xcite . in order to recover",
    "the gutzwiller amplitudes far from the critical points , global uniform approximations must be developed .    in this paper",
    "we first review briefly some uniform approximations , without discussing any technical details , and present two recent examples ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "we then give in sect .",
    "3 a personal account of some applications of the pot to the semiclassical description of gross - shell effects in various finite fermion systems ( nuclei , metal clusters , and a mesoscopic device ) in terms of the leading periodic orbits of their modeled mean - field hamiltonians .",
    "uniform approximations can most elegantly be derived using normal forms of the action integral in the exponent of the semiclassical green function in the phase - space representation @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived a general trace formula for the generic breaking of periodic orbit families in two - dimensional systems with u(1 ) symmetry into isolated pairs of stable and unstable orbits .",
    "starting from the berry - tabor trace formula @xcite in the integrable limit , they generalized the local uniform approximation of ozorio de almeida and hannay @xcite by means of a non - linear coordinate transformation , expanding the jacobian of this transformation and the van vleck determinant consistently with the expansion of the action integral in the semiclassical green function , and matching the asymptotic gutzwiller amplitudes and actions of the isolated orbits away from the integrable limit .",
    "no generally valid trace formula for the breaking of higher symmetries have been found so far .",

    "an excellent agreement between quantum mechanics and semiclassics is reached up to about 75% of the critical energy . at low energies ,",

    "the most systematic development of uniform trace formulae for all generic types of bifurcations has been undertaken by sieber and schomerus @xcite , who also used local normal forms and extended them in order to smoothly join the asymptotic gutzwiller amplitudes of the isolated orbits as sketched above .",
    "hereby also the analytical continuations of periodic orbits into the complex phase space ( so - called ` ghost orbits ' @xcite ) contribute in the neighborhood of the bifurcations .",
    "interferences of close - lying bifurcations ( of codimension two ) @xcite and bifurcations of ghost orbits @xcite have also been successfully treated with the same technique .    in @xcite ,",

    "the standard uniform approximations were not used in @xcite ;        the divergences in the spherical limit and at the bifurcations of the short diameter orbit ( i.e. , of its repetitions ) could be removed by limiting the lowest - order saddle - point integration to the finite limits imposed by the classically allowed region .",

    "an extension of this study to the three - dimensional spheroidal cavity is in progress @xcite .",
    "a simple , but efficient way to avoid the difficulties connected with symmetry breaking and bifurcations , at least in some situations , is to use a perturbative trace formula developed by creagh @xcite . in this approach",
    "which , of course , can only be used for sufficiently small deviations from an integrable limit , the effect of a non - integrable perturbation is only taken into account in the actions of the periodic orbits ; the stability amplitudes and maslov indices of the integrable system are kept unchanged .",

    "as shown in @xcite , only primitive orbits with up to @xmath23 reflections were needed in each plane to obtain a converged result ; the two shortest orbits ( diameter and triangle ) were , in fact , sufficient to obtain the correct topology of the asymmetric fission barrier .",
    "as in @xcite , the spin - orbit interaction was neglected ; instead , the fermi energy was adjusted such that the isomer minimum appeared at the correct deformation .",

    "the quantum - mechanical states responsible for this shell effect are a few ` diabatic ' states whose eigenenergies depend strongly on the asymmetry parameter , causing the energy gain in going from the symmetric to the asymmetric saddle , whereas most other states are insensitive to it ( cf .",
    "the diabatic quantum states in the present cavity model were shown in @xcite to have their probability maxima exactly in the planes containing the shortest periodic orbits .",
    "furthermore , an approximate ebk quantization of the classical motion near those planes reproduces the eigenergies of the diabatic quantum states almost quantitatively @xcite , thus establishing a nice quantum - to - classical correspondence in a highly nonlinear complex system .",
    "we finally turn to a mesoscopic arrangement in which a two - dimensional electron gas is confined laterally to a channel of width @xmath25 m .",

    "was observed near those values of @xmath28 for which a cyclotron orbit fits around the antidots .",
