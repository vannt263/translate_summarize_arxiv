    "this paper is devoted to a domain decomposition method based on the stddm method ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for the helmholtz problem in the full space @xmath0 with sommerfeld radiation condition : @xmath1 where the wave number @xmath2 is positive and @xmath3 having compact support , where @xmath4 is the dual space of @xmath5 .",
    "the problem is satisfied in a weak sense ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "helmholtz boundary value problems appear in various applications , for example , in the context of inverse and scattering problems .",
    "since the huge number of degrees of freedom is required resulting from the pollution error and the highly indefinite nature of helmholtz problem with large number wave @xcite , it is challenging to solve the algebraic linear equations resulting from the finite difference or finite element method with large wave number .",
    "considerable efforts in the literature have been made .",
    "one way is to find efficient and cheap methods @xcite , such as the coutinous interior penalty finite element method @xcite , which use less degrees of freedom as the same relative error reached .",
    "another way is to find efficient algorithms for solving discrete helmholtz equations , e.g. benamou and desprs @xcite , gander et al @xcite for domain decomposition techniques and brandt and livshit @xcite , elman et at @xcite for multigrid methods .",
    "recently engquist and ying constructed a new sweeping preconditioner for the interior solution @xcite .",
    "then chen and xiang proposed the source transfer domain decomposition method ( stddm ) @xcite , in which only some local pml problems defined locally outside the union of two layers are solved .",
    "thus the complexity of stddm is the sum of the complexity of the algorithms for solving those local problems which reduce the complexity to solve the whole linear system .",
    "we are inspired by the key idea of stddm , and the main lemmas and idea of proofs also come from their work .    in this paper",
    "we show the improved pure source transfer domain decomposition method ( pstddm ) .",
    "let @xmath6 .",
    "assume that @xmath7 is supported in @xmath8 .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath9 into @xmath10 segments with the points @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "then we denote the layers by @xmath13 clearly , @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 in @xmath16 and @xmath17 elsewhere .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the key idea is that by defining the source transfer function @xmath20 in the sense that @xmath21 and letting @xmath22 , then we have for any @xmath23 @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the green s function of the problem . observing , we know that @xmath26 in @xmath16 consists of two independent parts .",
    "the first part only involves the sources in @xmath16 and @xmath27 and the second one only involves the source in @xmath28 .",
    "thus they could be solved independently by using the pml method outside only @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "similar to stddm , our pstddm also consists of two steps which could run in parallel and the complexity of every step is the same as that of stddm .",
    "the error of pstddm are not larger than that of stddm if the same numerical algorithm , such as the finite element or difference method , was used . besides",
    ", since every step of pstddm just consists of local pml problems defined in the whole space , not in the half - space with dirichlet boundary , these local pml problems also can be solved by using our pstddm recursively . as a result",
    ", the computational domain is divided into blocks and the local pml problems needed to be solved are defined outside the union of four adjacent blocks .",
    "the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) is a mesh termination technique of effectiveness , simplicity and flexibility in computational wave propagation .",
    "after the pioneering work of brenger @xcite , various constructions of pml absorbing layers have been proposed and many theoretical results about helmholtz problem , such as those about the convergence and stability , have been studied @xcite . in this paper , the uniaxial pml methods will be used .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , pure source transfer domain decomposition method in @xmath0 and some important lemmas and theorems , which are fundamental and illuminating for the pstddm in truncated domain , are introduced .",
    "section [ sec3 ] shows the algorithm in the truncated bounded domain and the main result , that is , the exponentially convergence of the solution of pstddm in the truncated domain to the solution in @xmath0 . in section [ sec4 ] , we show that the local pml problems can be solved by out pstddm recursively and proof the convergence of the method . at last , we both use the method as a direct solver and an efficient preconditioner in the gmres method to solve the helmholtz equation .",
    "in this section , we introduce the pstddm for the pml method in the whole space .",
    "first , we recall the progress of deriving the pml method and set the medium properties of perfect matched lays which are a bit different from traditional medium and would be used in the following lemmas and theorems @xcite . in subsection",
