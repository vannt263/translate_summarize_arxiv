    "molecules in vibrationally excited states are unique tools to study hot molecular gas in interstellar and circumstellar environments . the vibrationally excited states can be pumped by ir radiation in the dusty environment close to the exciting object ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a linear molecule with @xmath7 atoms has @xmath8 vibrational modes . for hcn , this yields four vibrational modes",
    "is used to denote a certain vibrational mode or the frequency whereas @xmath9 denotes the vibrational quantum number .",
    "] , two of which are stretching modes ( cn stretch @xmath10 , ch stretch @xmath11 ) , and the @xmath12 bending mode ( @xmath13 ) which is doubly degenerate since the molecule is free to bend in two orthogonal planes . if the molecule is bending and rotating simultaneously , the degeneracy is lifted giving rise to a phenomenon denoted _ @xmath0-type doubling _ : the degenerate bending state can be regarded as having components of an additional angular momentum @xmath14 about the figure axis with @xmath15 . for a first excited bending mode",
    "@xmath16 causes the splitting of every rotational level into two sublevels .",
    "now two different types of transitions with either @xmath17 or @xmath2 may occur , the latter being denoted _ direct @xmath0-type transitions _",
    "figure [ term - hcn ] ) .",
    "since the splitting of the sublevels of a given @xmath18 is rather small , the corresponding transitions occur at low frequencies . for a molecule in a first excited bending mode",
    "those are to first order given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath0-type doubling constant ( @xmath21mhz ) .    in the laboratory , direct @xmath0-type transitions",
    "were first measured by @xcite for the molecules hcn and ocs . in space ,",
    "rotational transitions of vibrationally excited hcn ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; `` vibrational satellites '' ) were first detected by @xcite toward orion - kl and irc+10216 .",
    "meanwhile , hcn was also detected in much higher vibrationally excited states ( e.g. @xmath24 , @xcite ) .",
    "a detection of the @xmath25 direct @xmath0-type transition of hcn ( @xmath3 ) in irc+10216 has previously been reported by @xcite , although no details are given .",
    "we started a detailed study of vibrationally excited carbon chain molecules toward the protoplanetary nebula crl618 at radio and millimeter wavelengths to examine their radial distribution by measuring their vibrational temperatures . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the first detection of seven consecutive direct @xmath0-type transitions of hcn ( @xmath3 ) at cm wavelengths , commencing with @xmath26 through 14 . the results on the higher cyanopolyynes hc@xmath27n and hc@xmath28n are reported separately @xcite .",
    "the observations were performed during 8 observing sessions from 1999 march to 2002 january employing the 100 m radiotelescope of the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie at effelsberg , germany . as frontends the 0.65 cm , 1 cm , 1.3 cm , and 1.9 cm hemt receivers with typical receiver temperatures from 30 to 70k , respectively , were used .",
    "the fwhm beam widths and the frequencies of the hcn lines are given in table [ analysis ] .",
    "pointing was checked every one to two hours on crl618 itself or other appropriate radio sources resulting in an average pointing accuracy of 4 .",
    "the intensity scale was established using continuum drift scans on w3(oh ) , ngc7027 and 3c147 and comparing with the flux densities given by @xcite . pointing scans on crl618",
    "were used to determine its flux density relative to these calibration sources ( table [ analysis ] ) .",
    "spectra of the @xmath29 line of hcn in its @xmath13 bending mode were obtained in 1999 december with the 10.4 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) with a system temperature of 600  k. the line was observed in the upper sideband and several different observing frequencies were used to avoid blending from lines in the lower sideband . the spectrometer and observing procedure",
    "are described by @xcite .",
    "the cso beamsize at 356 ghz is 26  and we assumed a beam efficiency of 78% ( taken from the cso webpage ) .",
    "crl 618 was observed in the @xmath30 direct @xmath0-type transition ( cf .",
    "table [ analysis ] ) with the very large array ( vla ) in its b configuration , leading to an angular resolution of 0.12@xmath31 . at the time of the observations ,",
    "15 antennas were equipped with 0.7 cm receivers .",
    "a total bandwidth of 6.25  mhz was observed with 128 channels and the spectral resolution was 48.8 khz .",
    "the total time on source was 3.5h .",
    "regular observations of 0555 + 398 , 3c48 and 3c84 were used for amplitude , flux and bandpass calibration , respectively .",
    "the phase was selfcalibrated on the strong continuum emission from crl618 .",
    "the remaining non q - band antennas were used to observe the @xmath32 direct @xmath0-type transition at 4488.48mhz .",
    "no line was detected at an rms noise level of 4 mjy in 0.8 km / s wide channels .",
    "the total continuum flux at this frequency is @xmath33  mjy .",
    "figure [ lines_final ] shows the direct @xmath0-type lines observed toward crl618 and the line parameters from gaussian fits to the spectra are given in table [ analysis ] .",
    "the @xmath1 direct @xmath0-type transitions appear as absorption lines towards the continuum of the h ii region with line velocities of approximately @xmath34kms@xmath35 .",
    "the systemic velocity @xmath36 of crl618 is @xmath3724.2kms@xmath35 @xcite , hence all of the observed lines are blueshifed relative to @xmath36 indicating that the lines originate from a hot , expanding circumstellar envelope . to determine the physical conditions of the absorbing gas",
    ", we used a spherical lte model of an expanding envelope , developed to interpret our observations of vibrationally excited hc@xmath27n derived by @xcite . to fit the hcn lines we use the temperature , density and velocity structure of the expanding envelope , which fits the hc@xmath27n lines , and only vary the hcn abundance . using a temperature of 560  k ( see discussion below ) a hcn column density of @xmath5  @xmath6",
    "is needed to cause the observed absorption .",
    "the resulting fits to the spectra are shown in figure [ 3d_model ] together with a spectrum of the hc@xmath27n @xmath38 @xmath39 transition which has a similar upper energy ( @xmath40k ) since no continuum flux measurements were performed at 350  ghz , the hcn @xmath29 spectra are shown in brightness temperature units , whereas for the other spectra the ratio of line to continuum temperature , which reduces calibration uncertainties , is shown .",
    "the deviation of the hcn @xmath29 model from the observed spectrum could be due to pointing and/or focus errors : a pointing error of 10  alone would explain the difference between observation and model and can not be excluded .",
    "the model consists of power laws for temperature , density and velocity starting at an inner radius of 0.11 and an hii region within that radius , which fits the continuum measurements of crl  618 .",
    "the temperature at the inner radius is 560  k. in the model , the hcn @xmath29 line is highly optically thick and mostly sensitive to the model temperature and the emitting size .",
    "the hcn direct @xmath0-type lines , on the other hand , are optically thin and probe a combination of temperature and column density of the model .",
    "the best fit model has a hcn / hc@xmath27n abundance ratio of 3 to 6 dependent on the assumed population of the vibrational levels of hc@xmath27n which is consistent with the result obtained by mid - infrared absorption measurements by @xcite .",
    "figure [ vla - hcn ] shows the results of the vla observations .",
    "the total continuum flux density at 40 ghz , estimated from the flux on the shortest baselines , is 0.75 jy with an uncertainty of 10% .",
    "the size of the continuum emission is @xmath41 , estimated from a gaussian fit to the uv data . to increase the spectral sensitivity ,",
    "every four channels were averaged together and a taper in the uv plane was applied , reducing the angular resolution to @xmath42 .",
    "the insert in figure [ vla - hcn ] shows the spectrum integrated over the indicated area .",
    "line parameters of a gaussian fit to the spectrum are given in table [ analysis ] . to image the hcn absorption",
    "the continuum was subtracted from the data using the channel ranges marked in the insert of figure [ vla - hcn ] .",
    "the contours in figure [ vla - hcn ] show the hcn absorption averaged over the line .",
    "the observed 40  ghz continuum emission compares well with the results of @xcite at 23  ghz .",
    "the hcn absorption falls into the same velocity range as the hot core ( hc ) component seen in ammonia by @xcite .",
    "the hcn absorption is slightly shifted to the west from the center of the continuum , which was also observed for the hc ammonia component and the hot dense disk observed by @xcite .",
    "however , no absorption is observed at the ammonia broad absorption velocity of @xmath3750km@xmath43 which @xcite interpreted as occurring from post - shocked clumps .",
    "accordingly , the hcn absorption most likely originates from the same volume of gas as the ammonia hot core component and the dense disk .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1 transitions appearing as absorption lines toward the continuum , the @xmath4 transition is found in emission . blending with an unknown line can not be ruled out entirely , but to the best of our knowledge there is no known transition of a different molecule , and no trace of a @xmath4 absorption ( which would modify the emission - profile of the blending line ) is seen .",
    "moreover , the ( blueshifted ) velocity and the line width correspond well to the velocities and linewidths of the @xmath1 transitions .",
    "in particular the linewidth argument is compelling , since other emission lines are much broader ( e.g.  the linewidth of the hc@xmath44n @xmath45 transition is 27  km  s@xmath35 , @xcite ) .",
    "these facts suggest that the @xmath4 transition is a weak maser amplifying the continuum .",
    "its optical depth has a different sign , but is similar in value to the absorption lines .",
    "how can this maser be understood ?",
    "a quantitative analysis would require quite detailed modeling of the pumping mechanism , which is not feasible because many of the transition rates ( in particular collision rates between vibrational states and within the vibrationally excited state ) are not or only poorly known .",
    "however , one can argue as follows that this transition is easily perturbed or inverted : the splitting due to @xmath0-type doubling is much smaller than the rotational splitting . considering the rotational level system @xmath26 , @xmath4 and assuming that the excitation temperature of the @xmath46 is @xmath47 ( and equal to @xmath48 ) , while the excitation temperature for the @xmath49 ( upper ) states is taken to be @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 )",
    ", one can show that inversion occurs ( @xmath52 ) if the following condition is met : @xmath53 in terms of occupation numbers , a difference @xmath54 = 2.5% means that for an excitation temperature of 560  k , the occupation of the @xmath55 level needs to be elevated in population by only 0.17% with respect to a completely thermalized distribution to invert the direct @xmath0-type transition .",
    "if one considers the populations relative to the vibrational ground state , similar arguments can be made .",
    "a similar system is the ammonia molecule , where the inversion splitting is much smaller than the rotational splitting , and indeed , some masers are found for ammonia as well ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the actual pumping mechanism is probably quite different for the ammonia masers , the similarity is that it is not difficult to produce masers in the inversion lines .",
    "having argued that a small perturbation is sufficient , we still have to identify a possible cause for perturbations in our @xmath0-type system .",
    "one good candidate is a line overlap .",
    "such a mechanism has been invoked successfully for pumping of oh masers ( e.g.  @xcite ) , although the details of the pumping mechanism are different .",
    "one possible candidate responsible for a perturbation in the @xmath56 @xmath3 levels is an overlap of rotational lines of the vibrationally excited molecule : for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 transitions of the @xmath3 and @xmath59 states the @xmath0 components @xmath60 and @xmath61 are separated by only 11 and 58mhz , @xmath59 , @xmath62 at 712361mhz ; @xmath57 , @xmath3 , @xmath63 at 712372mhz ; @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath62 at 801421mhz ; @xmath58 , @xmath3 , @xmath63 at 801363mhz ] , respectively , corresponding to @xmath64kms@xmath35 and @xmath65kms@xmath35 . accordingly , the first overlap could occur locally whereas the second one could connect different parts of the envelope .",
    "a corresponding maser effect has been observed for sio masers by @xcite .",
    "initiated by the results presented here , additional searches for direct @xmath0-type transitions of hcn have been performed towards high - mass star forming regions .",
    "so far , we were able to detect the @xmath4 transition toward orion - kl and sgrb2(n ) and the @xmath66 transitions toward g10.47 + 0.03 using the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( thorwirth et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "direct @xmath0-type transitions are optically thin and hence can be used to derive reliable column density estimates of the hot gas component .",
    "moreover , the vla observations of crl618 presented here demonstrate that this special kind of transitions can be used to observe hot gas at high angular resolution and low frequencies .",
    "using the effelsberg 100 m telescope and the vla , we have detected seven direct @xmath0-type transitions of hcn in its @xmath3 state .",
    "all lines appear in absorption against the embedded hii region , except for the @xmath4 transition , which shows weak maser action . the observed",
    "line velocities agree well with those observed in vibrationally excited hc@xmath27n by wyrowski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who used their extensive data to model the physical parameters of the hot , dense emission region .",
    "vla observations of the @xmath30 line reveal the emission region is compact and covers only the western part of the embedded hii region , similarly to ammonia .",
    "since in addition to crl 618 we detected @xmath0-type hcn lines toward hot molecular cores in regions of high - mass star formation , they also represent an interesting new tool to study the immediate vicinity of young ( proto-)stellar objects .",
    "triggered by the radioastronomical observations presented here , a laboratory investigation of direct @xmath0-type transitions of hcn ( @xmath3 ) has been carried out in the cologne laboratory covering rotational quantum numbers up to @xmath67 at 278.7ghz ( thorwirth et al .",
    ", in preparation ) the complete analysis will be presented in a following paper .",
