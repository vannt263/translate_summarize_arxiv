    "by the development of modern and sensitive growth techniques such as ultra - high vacuum and molecular beam epitaxy , characterization and realization of thin magnetic films became experimentally accessible even in the mono - layer limit which consequently led to considerable amount of interest in thin film magnetism in the last four decades , both from theoretical and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bulk magnetism , surface effects which mainly originate as a result of reduced coordination number of the surface of the material are prominent in real physical systems . the existence of surfaces simply causes a broken symmetry in the system . therefore , magnetic properties of finite magnetic materials such as magnetic thin films may differ from those of bulk materials . as a consequence of these facts ,",
    "the surface may exhibit an ordered phase even if the bulk itself is disordered which has already been experimentally observed @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the models based on ising - type spin hamiltonians successfully explain the critical phenomena of highly anisotropic magnetic uniaxial thin films @xcite by utilizing well known theoretical tools including monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , and effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite",
    ". however , a vast majority of magnetic materials in nature do not exhibit such a strong uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "hence , the theoretical investigation of magnetism in these systems require more realistic models . in this context , heisenberg model on thin film geometry has been studied by a wide variety of methods such as renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite , high temperature series expansions ( htse ) @xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , eft @xcite , mft @xcite , and green functions formalism ( gff ) @xcite .",
    "eft method which is superior to conventional mft is widely used in the literature .",
    "for instance , neto and co - workers utilized this method to investigate classical and quantum heisenberg thin films @xcite .",
    "one of their most remarkable findings is that the nel temperature @xmath1 of an anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) quantum heisenberg film is greater than curie temperature @xmath2 of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) quantum heisenberg film whereas in the classical case the two models ( i.e. af and fm ) exhibit the same critical temperature values . in principle , in order to apply the eft formulation for quantum and classical heisenberg models , one should improve the standard eft method @xcite by defining the spin - spin interactions on a larger cluster which was formerly introduced by bobk et al .",
    "@xcite and known as eft-2 formulation in the literature @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical and experimental investigations are also focused on the finite size shift of the critical temperature @xmath3 of the film from the corresponding bulk critical temperature as a function of film thickness which is characterized by a shift exponent .",
    "more clearly , for a thin film with thickness @xmath4 , it follows a power law behavior @xcite for thick films @xmath5 where @xmath0 is the shift exponent , and it is directly related to the bulk correlation length exponent as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "high resolution mc simulations yield that for 3d ising and heisenberg models , the exponent values are @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the universality behavior of ising thin films has been examined widely in the literature @xcite .    experimentally , bramfeld and willis @xcite reported results for nickel films and they observed a thickness dependent dimensional crossover .",
    "fuchs et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the variation of magnetization as a function of film thickness for lanthanum films and extracted an exponent value @xmath9 which resembles a value obtained by mft for ising model .",
    "for ultra - thin nickel films , a shift exponent @xmath10 was found @xcite , and also a crossover from a three- to a two - dimensional magnetic behavior was observed by li et al .",
    "for thin iron films @xcite , phenomenological finite - size scaling analysis yields an effective shift exponent @xmath11 which is twice as large as the value expected from the conventional finite - size scaling prediction @xcite whereas for amorphous iron and aluminum films @xcite @xmath12 were found .",
    "furthermore , thickness dependent crossover of the exponent @xmath0 was also observed for gadolinium films in the formalism of finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "although the topic has attracted a considerable amount of interest , the dimensionality in the thin films is not well established and the investigation of universality properties , especially for thicker films , needs particular attention @xcite .",
    "hence , in the present paper , our aim is to investigate the thickness dependent curie temperature and its relative shift from the bulk critical point using eft-2 formulation for ferromagnetic thin films described by classical and quantum spin models .",
    "the paper can be outlined as follows : in sec .",

    "our results show the trend @xmath70 which agrees well with those obtained by htse calculations @xcite and mft predictions @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that for the ising thin films , the obtained values using eft-2 are clearly greater than those obtained by eft-1 formulation @xcite .",
    "apart from these , one can conclude from table-[table1 ] that the presence of modified surface exchange interactions clearly affect the value of the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "namely , for the weak surface couplings such as @xmath71 , quantum exponents are barely larger than the classical exponents whereas in the presence of a moderate surface coupling such as @xmath66 , an opposite scenario takes place .",
    "moreover , it seems like a dimensional crossover may take place as @xmath72 varies . in other words ,",
    "the exponent value @xmath0 is very close to the bulk value for small @xmath72 .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to three - dimensional character of the film , since @xmath73 @xcite whereas for greater values of @xmath72 , the system tends to reveal a two dimensional character even for thicker films .",
    "it is also worth to note that our exponent values for the heisenberg thin films agree well with those obtained using gff @xcite in which @xmath74 was predicted .",
    "however , htse @xcite and mft @xcite yields rather small exponents in comparison to eft-2 results which may be due to the fact that the thickness of the films considered in these works lacks to provide the condition @xmath64 .",
