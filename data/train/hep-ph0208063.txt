    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the masses of gauge bosons and fermions are generated by one scalar field doublet .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , a neutral cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) remains as a physical particle .",
    "a supersymmetry ( susy ) between fermions and bosons provides a natural explanation of the higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) from radiative corrections in the framework of a grand unified theory and preserves the elementary nature of higgs bosons .",
    "the higgs sector of a supersymmetric theory must contain at least two @xmath16 doublets @xcite for anomaly cancellation . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite , the higgs sector has two doublets @xmath17 and @xmath18 that couple to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 fermions , respectively .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , there remain five physical higgs bosons : a pair of singly charged higgs bosons @xmath21 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath12 ( heavier ) and @xmath22 ( lighter ) , and a neutral cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath11 .",
    "the higgs potential is constrained by supersymmetry such that all tree - level higgs boson masses and couplings are determined by just two independent parameters , commonly chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath23 ) and the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs fields ( @xmath24 ) .    in the model ii of two higgs doublet models @xcite and in the mssm , the couplings and production cross sections of @xmath25 are enhanced by factors of @xmath26 . for large @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath27 decay mode @xcite is a promising discovery channel for the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that neutral higgs bosons might be observable via their @xmath28 decays @xcite in a large region of the ( @xmath29 ) plane , provided that sufficient @xmath30-tagging capability can be achieved .",
    "however , simulations for the atlas detector concluded that detection of the @xmath28 channel would be difficult @xcite .",
    "the lhc discovery potential of the muon pair channel for neutral higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric model was demonstrated by kao and stepanov @xcite , and was later confirmed by the atlas collaboration @xcite . in the minimal supergravity unified model @xcite ,",
    "the significance of @xmath10 is greatly improved at large @xmath8 @xcite because @xmath23 and @xmath31 become small from the evolution of renormalization group equations with large @xmath9 couplings . on the other hand , it is very challenging to search for muon pairs from higgs decays in the standard model @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath32 channel has a small branching fraction , this is compensated by an improved mass resolution for the muon pairs . for large @xmath8 , the muon pair discovery mode might be the only channel at the lhc that allows precise reconstruction of the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 masses .    in this article , we present the prospects for discovering the mssm neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) produced with bottom quarks via higgs decays into muon pairs ( @xmath33 ) at the lhc .",

    "it turns out that the contribution from quark - antiquark annihilation ( @xmath38 ) is negligible .    in the mssm , gluon fusion ( @xmath39 )",
    "is the major source of neutral higgs bosons for @xmath8 less than about 4 .",
    "if @xmath8 is larger than 7 , neutral higgs bosons in the mssm are dominantly produced from ( @xmath37 ) @xcite . since the yukawa couplings of @xmath40 are enhanced by @xmath26 , the production rate of neutral higgs bosons",
    "is usually enhanced at large @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath23 larger than about 150 gev , the couplings of the lighter scalar @xmath22 to gauge bosons and fermions become similar to those of the sm higgs boson . in this case , gluon fusion is the major source of the @xmath22 even if @xmath8 is large .",
    "in general , the qcd radiative corrections to the subprocess @xmath39 are substantial @xcite .",
    "however , the next to the leading order ( nlo ) cross section of @xmath41 via @xmath42 with qcd radiative corrections has been found to be only slightly reduced from the leading order ( lo ) contribution evaluated with the bottom - quark pole mass @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "it is a good approximation to evaluate the nlo cross section of @xmath41 with the leading order ( lo ) contribution multiplied by a k factor , where @xmath44 is evaluated with lo parton distribution functions and 1-loop evolution of the strong coupling ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is evaluated with nlo parton distribution functions and 2-loop evolution of @xmath45 .",

    ", the branching fraction of @xmath57 is about @xmath58 when the @xmath28 mode dominates higgs decays , where 3 is a color factor of the quarks and @xmath59 is the running mass at the scale @xmath60 .",

    "we have also studied the inclusive discovery channel of @xmath10 .",
    "the dominant physics background to the inclusive final state of @xmath32 comes from the drell - yan process @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "we make the same cuts discussed above and veto events with any jet passing the cuts on @xmath102 and @xmath110 to effectively reduce additional backgrounds from @xmath111 and @xmath73 where @xmath112 or @xmath30 .",
    "we show the invariant mass distribution of muon pairs in fig . 3 for @xmath113 with @xmath114 and 50 , the sm processes of @xmath104 , and contributions from @xmath115 with cuts and tagging efficiencies for @xmath92 30 fb@xmath80 .",
    "also shown are the muon pair invariant mass distributions for the inclusive final state of @xmath116 and its dominant background from the drell - yan process @xmath117 .",
    "there are several interesting aspects to note from this figure : ( a ) including two @xmath30 quarks in the final state greatly improves the signal to background ratio with realistic efficiencies of b tagging and jet mistagging at the atlas and the cms detectors , ( b ) the sm subprocess of @xmath105 and @xmath106 make the major contribution to the physics background for @xmath118 gev , but @xmath66 and @xmath67 become the dominant background for higher muon pair invariant mass .",

    "is slightly enlarged for a smaller @xmath146 , but the observable region of @xmath151 is slightly reduced because the lighter top squarks make the @xmath12 and the @xmath22 lighter ; also the @xmath152 coupling is enhanced while the @xmath153 coupling is reduced @xcite .",

    "the discovery of the associated final state of @xmath156 will provide information about the yukawa couplings of @xmath9 and an opportunity to measure @xmath8 .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath163 is smaller than the tau mass resolution , it would be difficult to separate them in the tau pair discovery mode .",
    "the muon discovery channel at the lhc might be employed to distinguish the @xmath12 and the @xmath11 in multi - higgs - doublet models for @xmath163 slightly larger than the muon mass resolution ( @xmath123 ) of the cms and the atlas detectors .",
