    "despite decades of studies and compelling evidence that a significant fraction @xcite of stars with initial masses in excess of @xmath28 solar masses explode as at the end of their evolution , the exact details of the explosion mechanism are still uncertain @xcite .",
    "current state - of - the art 3d simulations either fail to explode or have explosion energies that fall short of the observed energies by factors of a few for most of the progenitor mass range @xcite .",
    "the dynamics at the center of a star undergoing core collapse is shaped by a delicate balance between competing effects where all of the known forces : gravity , electromagnetism , weak and strong interactions , are important .",
    "the task of modeling these systems is made particularly challenging by the fact that the generation of the asymptotic explosion energies , although enormous ( @xmath3 ) , requires a rather subtle , percent - level imbalance between non - linear processes over many dynamical times .",
    "the flow of plasma in the core of a star going supernova is known to be unstable to convection @xcite and/or to another large scale instability known as standing accretion shock instability @xcite . in any case ,",
    "given the very large reynolds numbers , as large as @xmath4 in the region of interest @xcite ( the so - called gain region , where neutrino heating dominates over neutrino cooling ) , it is expected that the resulting flow will be fully turbulent . it has been suggested @xcite recently that turbulence and , in particular , turbulent pressure could tip the balance of the forces in favor of explosion . in this respect ,",
    "anisotropy is of key importance , because it results in an effective radial pressure support with adiabatic index @xmath5 , much larger than that of thermal ( radiation ) pressure ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this means that turbulent kinetic energy is a much more valuable source of radial pressure support than thermal energy ( see appendix [ sec : turbulent.pressure ] ) .",
    "all of the current numerical simulations employ the paradigm @xcite ( also known as monotone integrated les ( miles ) ) of exploiting the dissipative nature of methods as an implicit turbulence model .",
    "however , the combination of the use of rather dissipative schemes and the relatively low spatial resolution that can be achieved in global simulations is such that the fidelity with which turbulence is captured is questionable @xcite .    to be useful in the context of simulations , an should , at the very least , account for the right rate of decay of the kinetic energy at the largest scales while avoiding unphysical pile up of energy at smaller scales .",
    "unfortunately , all of the current simulations seem to be strongly dominated by the so - called bottleneck effect @xcite , which corresponds to an inefficient energy transfer across intermediate scales due to the viscous suppression of non - linear interaction with smaller scales @xcite .",
    "current global simulations achieve resolutions , in the turbulent region , comparable to those of @xmath7 lattices in periodic domains @xcite . at these resolutions ,",
    "almost all of the dynamical range of the simulations can be expected to be directly affected by numerical viscosity @xcite .",
    "the fidelity with which turbulence is captured in these simulations will then depend on the degree with which the numerical truncation error approximates an les closure .    in this respect ,",
    "it has been shown by @xcite and @xcite that many methods can be too dissipative to yield a faithful description of turbulence at low resolutions",
    ". these studies , however , considered a different regime , decaying isotropic turbulence , while turbulence in a core - collapse supernova , as well as in many other astrophysical settings , is often strongly anisotropic @xcite as rotational invariance is broken by gravity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also considered different numerical schemes with respect to those used in supernova simulations . both of these aspects can ,",
    "in principle , be important .",
    "first of all , strong anisotropies could potentially influence the turbulence dynamics at the level of the energy cascade and of the dissipation @xcite .",
    "secondly , some of the schemes used in computational astrophysics , such as the @xcite as well as some of the muscl @xcite schemes , have been shown , differently from some of the methods considered by @xcite and @xcite , to be well suited for @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to fill the gap between existing theoretical studies and the particular applications of our interest . to this end",
    "we use a publicly available code , flash @xcite , which is widely used in the computational astrophysics community , and perform a series of simulations of turbulence in a regime relevant for core - collapse supernovae : driven at large scale , with large anisotropies and mildly compressible .",
    "we use five different numerical setups and , for each , several resolutions in the range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in a periodic domain",
    ". we study in detail the way in which the energy cascade across different scales is represented by our and we discuss the use of local or lower dimensional diagnostics that can be used to assess the quality of a global simulation in a complex geometry where 3d spectra are not readily available .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : methods ] , we discuss the exact setup of our simulations and the diagnostic quantities used in our analysis . then , in section [ sec : results.basic ] , we discuss the basic characteristics of the flow realized in our simulations . in section [ sec : results.energy ] , we present a detailed analysis of the way in which the energy cascade is captured by the different schemes at different scales . in particular , we quantify the accuracy with which different methods capture the decay rate of energy from the largest scales and the way in which energy is distributed across scales .",
    "we discuss the role of anisotropies in the context of the @xmath10law , a fundamental exact relation for isotropic and incompressible turbulence relating the statistics of velocity fluctuations with the energy dissipation rate ( see section [ sec : methods.structure ] ) , in section [ sec : results.45law ] .",
    "we explore the use of the 2d , transverse , energy spectrum as a diagnostic for 3d simulations in section [ sec : results.transverse ] .",
    "finally , we present a brief summary of our main findings , as well as a discussion of their implications for simulations in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix [ sec : turbulent.pressure ] , contains some supplemental background material on the role of turbulence in the explosion mechanism of .",
    "we consider a compressible fluid with a prescribed acceleration , @xmath11 , in a unit - box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the code that we employ for these simulations , flash , solves the gas - dynamics equations in conservation form .",
    "in particular we evolve the continuity equation @xmath12 and the momentum equation @xmath13 these equations are closed with a simple isentropic equation of state , @xmath14 that can be considered as a rough description of a gas dominated by radiation pressure . since the equation of state ensures an adiabatic evolution we do not need to solve the energy equation as equations , and suffice to fully describe the flow .",
    "equations & are solved using the directionally - unsplit hydrodynamics solver of the open - source flash simulation framework .",
    "flash implements the corner transport upwind method @xcite for fully directionally - unsplit evolution of the euler equations @xcite .",
    "flash includes several options for the order of spatial reconstruction @xcite , including 2@xmath15-order tvd @xcite , 3@xmath16-order ppm @xcite , and 5@xmath17-order wenoz @xcite .",
    "fluxes are computed at 2@xmath15 order accuracy using one of a number of approximate riemann solvers included in flash , such as hlle @xcite and hllc @xcite .",
    "second - order accuracy in time is achieved via a characteristic tracing evolution of the riemann solver input states to the time step midpoint @xcite .",
    "we remark that , in accordance with the , paradigm , we do not include any additional sub - grid scale model , but relied on the implicit turbulent closure built in the numerical schemes we use for the integration of the hydrodynamics equation .",
    "all of our simulations start with the fluid at rest @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "turbulence is driven using the stirring module of flash .",
    "this module uses the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite to generate stirring modes in fourier space .",
    "this yields an acceleration field which smoothly decorrelates @xcite over a timescale @xmath20 .",
    "the flash implementation permits the use of any arbitrary combination of solenoidal and compressive modes @xcite . for our runs ,",
    "we set @xmath21 , we use only solenoidal forcing and we restrict the accelerating field to be nonzero only in the first four fourier modes .",
    "this forcing is designed to mimic the influence of some larger scale weakly compressible flow and , for this reason , it does not include any compressible component .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for low mach number convection which is well described by the anelastic approximation , _",
    "e.g. , _  @xcite . in the context",
    ", simulations show that the turbulence is highly anisotropic , being roughly twice as strong in the radial direction as either tangential direction @xcite since it is driven by buoyancy due to a negative radial entropy gradient . in order to emulate this behavior , the accelerating field in the @xmath22direction ( which is going to play the role of the radial direction )",
    "is scaled by a constant factor ( before the solenoidal projection of the acceleration field ) such that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the reynolds stress tensor ( to simplify the notation we considered a frame in which @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "finally , the overall strength of the stirring is tuned to achieve a rms mach number of @xmath27 , which is typically observed in realistic simulations @xcite .      in order to study the cascade of the specific kinetic energy ( which we will refer to simply as `` kinetic energy '' or `` energy '' in the following ) , @xmath28",
    ", we will consider an energy budget equation across different scales , analogous to the one commonly employed in the study of incompressible , isotropic turbulence , _",
    "e.g. , _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the momentum equation in non - conservation form , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the specific volume of the gas .",
    "we can use equation to derive an evolution equation for the fourier transform of the velocity @xmath31 transforming both sides of equation we obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the convolution operator , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath34({\\mathbf{k } } ) = \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^3 } f({\\mathbf{q}})\\ , g({\\mathbf{k}}-{\\mathbf{q}})\\ , { \\mathrm{d}}^3{\\mathbf{q}}\\,.\\ ] ] if we multiply both sides of equation by @xmath35 and take the real part , we obtain an equation for the 3d energy spectrum @xmath36 where @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the energy spectrum ( the velocity ) and @xmath39 is the same transfer term as in the classical incompressible equations and @xmath40 is the energy injection rate .",
    "the @xmath41 term vanishes in the incompressible limit and represents the interaction between kinetic and acoustic modes . in practice , in our models",
    ", @xmath41 is found to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath39 at all scales and it is thus negligible . in any case",
    ", we retain @xmath41 in the analysis below .    for each of the spectral quantities , @xmath42 , being @xmath43 or @xmath40 , we define the integrated spectrum , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 @xmath46 being the dirac delta function .",
    "integrating equation , we obtain the following one - dimensional energy balance equation @xmath47 this can also be written in terms of the energy flux across scales , @xmath48 as @xmath49 notice that _ we did not assume isotropy in any of the above_.    equation is derived in the inviscid limit . in practice , our evolution method introduces dissipation in the form of `` numerical viscosity '' .",
    "this can be quantified in terms of the residual @xmath50 this can be used to define a wave number dependent numerical viscosity : @xmath51 we remark that @xmath52 does not , in general , correspond to a classical shear or bulk viscosity , but can nevertheless be interpreted as a relative measure of the dissipation acting at different wave numbers ( see , _",
    "@xcite for alternative approaches ) .    in practice , since we will be working in the stationary case , after having taken the appropriate time averages , @xmath53 reduces to @xmath54    finally , since we are working in a periodic domain , which we take of size @xmath55 , all of the spectra are quantized and non - trivial only for @xmath56 and @xmath57 integers .",
    "furthermore , all of the integrals in wave number space reduce to summations .",
    "integrals over spherical shells are transformed to weighted sums following @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of discrete wave - numbers in the shell @xmath60 .",
    "the energy spectrum and its sources / fluxes give a comprehensive picture of the energy cascade and can be used to assess the level of convergence of the simulation .",
    "unfortunately , 3d energy spectra and fluxes are not easily accessible in calculations in complex domains and/or with inhomogeneous turbulence . in these cases , local quantities in the physical domain are more easily extracted and analyzed . hence , one of the goals of this work is to validate the use of indirect measures of convergence of . among these quantities ,",
    "the structure functions of the velocity appear to be natural candidates for study .",
    "we define the velocity increments @xmath61\\cdot\\frac{{\\mathbf{r}}}{r}\\ ] ] and study the quantities @xmath62 where , @xmath63 denotes an ensemble average as well as a mean over all of the angles between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( in other words we are looking at the @xmath66 component of the @xmath67 decomposition of the structure functions @xcite ) . in the case of homogeneous turbulence @xmath68",
    "does not depend on @xmath69 and is thus a function of only the separation @xmath70 .",
    "the most important relation involving the structure functions is the so - called @xmath10law , which relates the third order structure function , @xmath71 , with the mean energy dissipation rate , @xmath72 and states that , for incompressible , homogeneous and isotropic turbulence @xcite : @xmath73 equation can be derived from the navier - stokes equation for fully - developed , incompressible , homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and it is one of the few exact relations in the theory of turbulence @xcite . in the anisotropic or compressible case , however ,",
    "equation is not strictly valid and could be violated in the data . as we show in section [ sec : results.45law ] , we find equation to be very well satisfied by our data , suggesting that the 3@xmath16 order structure function can be a very useful diagnostic in global simulations .",
    "another alternative to the analysis of 3d spectra , which has been adopted by several authors in the core - collapse supernova context @xcite , is the use of 2d spectra computed using a spherical harmonics expansion of the velocity field tangential to one or more spherical shells in the simulation .",
    "analogously , we emulate this by looking at quantities in the @xmath74 plane and we define the 2d spectra @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the projection of the velocity perpendicular to the @xmath22direction and we introduced the partial fourier transform of @xmath77 : @xmath78 in the limit of infinite reynolds number / resolution , the 2d spectrum is expected to have the same asymptotic behavior as the 3d spectrum , however it is a - priori unclear if @xmath79 is a good proxy for @xmath38 at finite resolution .",
    "for this reason we find it useful to investigate this here .    as was the case for the 3d spectra , also here",
    "the spectrum is non - trivial only for integer @xmath80 and @xmath57 , when periodicity is taken into account .",
    "the integral in equation is treated analogously to the integral in the equation for the 3d case , while the average in the @xmath22direction in equation is converted to an average over the @xmath22extent of the simulation box .",
    "we employ the finite - volume ( godunov ) approach in which physical states are reconstructed at inter - cell boundaries and local riemann problems are solved to compute the physical inter cell fluxes . in particular , we perform five groups of simulations using different numerical methods .",
    "each group is labeled using the name of the reconstruction algorithm and of the riemann solver .",
    "for instance ` tvd_hlle ` , denotes a group of simulations done using tvd reconstruction and hlle riemann solver .",
    "single simulations are labeled using their resolution so that , for instance , ` tvd_hlle_n128 ` , denotes the ` tvd_hlle ` run done using a @xmath81 grid .",
    "for all of the runs the timestep is chosen to have a cfl , _",
    "@xmath82 , of @xmath83 , @xmath84 being the maximum characteristics speed , with the exception of the ` ppm_hllc_cfl0.8 ` runs where we set the cfl to @xmath85 . for",
    "the tvd runs we use the slope limiter @xcite .",
    "the runs with ppm use the original flattening and artificial viscosity prescriptions from @xcite .",
    "the artificial viscosity coefficient is @xmath86 .",
    "we remark that the use of the artificial viscosity for ppm is not really necessary in this regime @xcite , however our goal is not to perform a study of the turbulent dynamics , but to assess how each numerical method performs when used under the same condition as in a real simulation where strong shocks need to be handled in some parts of the domain .        for each group of simulations we run four resolutions : @xmath87 and @xmath9 .",
    "the rms velocity in all of the runs is @xmath88 , giving an eddy turnover time @xmath89 .",
    "all of the simulations are run until time @xmath90 ( @xmath91 eddy turnover times ) .",
    "the time evolution of a few relevant diagnostics is shown in figure [ fig : time.evolution ] for our fiducial group of runs ( ` ppm_hllc ` ) at different resolutions .",
    "we can see how the flow is accelerated from rest and quickly reaches a steady , fully turbulent , state . in all cases ,",
    "steady state is reached after @xmath92 ( @xmath93 turnover time ) and the diagnostics are insensitive to the resolution .",
    "the results for the other runs ( not shown ) are very similar to the ones of ` ppm_hllc ` as they all achieve very similar rms mach numbers and reynolds stresses .",
    "all of the analysis shown in the rest of the paper are performed using @xmath94 3d snapshots ( evenly spaced in time ) of the data in the interval @xmath95 .        a first , qualitative , comparison between the different methods can be done by looking at their visualizations . in particular , in figure [ fig : vorticity ] , we show a visualization of the magnitude of the vorticity in the @xmath96@xmath97 plane for four of the five schemes ( excluding ` ppm_hllc_cfl0.8 ` ) at the highest resolution ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the data is taken at the final time ( @xmath90 ) . as it can be seen from the figure ,",
    "all of the simulations show the presence of thin , elongated , regions of high vorticity , as typically seen in of homogeneous turbulent flows @xcite . however , the width and the intensity of the vorticity at these smaller scales depend crucially on the numerical scheme",
    ". methods with small intrinsic numerical viscosity , such as ` ppm_hllc ` and ` wenoz_hllc ` , present smaller structures and more intermittent vorticity fields with respect to more dissipative methods , such as ` ppm_hlle ` and ` tvd_hlle ` .",
    "in this section we focus our analysis on the accuracy with which the energy cascade is captured by our runs .",
    "first , we focus on the largest scales of the simulation with the goal of quantifying the accuracy in the decay rate of the energy as a function of the resolution for the different methods .",
    "next , we will look at the energy distribution at smaller scales where , in resolved simulations , the inertial range starts .",
    "finally , we will look at the dynamics in the dissipation region and summarize .          in the limit of very large reynolds number it is assumed , in standard turbulence phenomenology @xcite , that there exists a range of wave numbers ( the inertial range ) where energy injection and dissipation can be neglected in equation . in this range",
    "we can write ( compressible effects are negligible in our simulations ) : @xmath98 so that stationarity requires @xmath99 . in particular , since energy is conserved , one finds @xmath100 .",
    "this means that , in the limit of large reynolds numbers , the energy decay rate depends only on the macroscopic properties of the flow ( and in particular not on the nature of the viscosity ) , a fact that has also been verified numerically @xcite .",
    "the significance of this property and its importance for the modeling of turbulence can not be overstated .    in the context of simulations",
    "this means that the large scale kinetic energy , a crucial quantity for the dynamics of the explosion @xcite , can be faithfully captured even with simulations achieving modest reynolds numbers .    for an , a basic requirement , then , is that a sufficiently high resolution should be achieved to correctly represent the energy cascade at the largest scales .",
    "what qualifies as a sufficiently high resolution is of course dependent on the details of the closure built into the scheme ( and on the accuracy required for the particular application ) . to quantify this , we can estimate the level of accuracy that can be reached at any given resolution , using our local simulations .",
    "in particular , we can study directly the energy flux across scales , defined by equation .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : energy.flux ] for all of the different runs , .    as discussed before",
    ", we expect that @xmath100 over an extended region in fourier space should be a direct indication that a simulation has been able to recover an inertial range .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , in light of previous results @xcite , we find that regions where @xmath101 as wide as a few wave numbers @xmath102 only appear at the highest resolutions ( we will discuss the inertial range in more detail in section [ sec : results.energy.spectra ] ) .",
    "however , the amount of energy decaying from the largest scales reaches an asymptotic value much quicker than that implying that the total kinetic energy budget at the largest scales is well resolved even at modest resolutions .     in the limit of large reynolds numbers / resolution . at @xmath81",
    "points all of the schemes show an error of less than @xmath103 , with the hllc schemes already close to the @xmath104 level . ]",
    "we can make a more quantitative statement concerning the energy decay rate by looking at the peak of the energy flux as a function of resolution , as shown in figure [ fig : dissipation.rate ] .",
    "we can see that at @xmath81 points all of the simulations have a deviation from the asymptotic energy decay rate of less than @xmath103 .",
    "the least dissipative methods already have an error close to the @xmath104 level .",
    "a comparison between ` ppm_hlle ` and ` ppm_hllc ` reveals the profound impact that the choice of the riemann solver has even at relatively large scale ( more on the dissipative properties of the different schemes in section [ sec : results.energy.viscosity ] ) .",
    "obviously , not all of the dynamics of turbulence can be reduced to the rate at which kinetic energy decays from the injection scale .",
    "the internal dynamics of the energy cascade , far from the injection scale and far from the dissipation range , can also play an important role in many applications . to analyze this aspect we consider in figure [ fig : energy.spectrum ] the energy spectrum of the velocity defined by equation .",
    "the spectra are compensated by @xmath105 to highlight regions with kolmogorov scaling , which might be expected in the inertial range .",
    "since we want to focus on quantities that do not depend ( or depend weakly ) on the nature of the energy injection at large scale , we show all of the spectra as a function of a dimensionless wave number , @xmath106 .",
    "the rationale behind this normalization is that , first of all , we assume the kolmogorov scale @xmath107 to be proportional to the grid spacing .",
    "secondly , the @xmath108 factor is introduced to have the dimensionless @xmath109 , @xmath106 coincide with the dimensional one for the highest resolution runs . with this choice , @xmath110 corresponds to a wavelength of a single grid point , @xmath111 corresponds to a wavelength of two grid points and so on .",
    "looking at any of the groups of runs in figure [ fig : energy.spectrum ] , one can immediately notice that the spectra obtained at different resolutions do not collapse into a single curve in the dissipation region , as would be required by kolmogorov s first similarity hypothesis @xcite ( _ cf .",
    "this lack of convergence in the dissipation region could be due to the non - linear viscosity of schemes .",
    "this , in turn , could result in an anomalous scaling of @xmath107 with the grid spacing .",
    "such scaling has been reported in the past for , but it is not very well understood @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the three different groups of simulations employing the hllc riemann solver seems to support this hypothesis and suggests that the nonlinear viscosity introduced by the riemann solver is an important ingredient in setting this scaling .",
    "convergence appears to be recovered at larger scales @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , but the spectra appear to be dominated by the bottleneck effect .",
    "this manifests itself as a bump in the compensated spectra extending from the dissipation range until the end of the inertial range , for the simulations that show one ( _ e.g. , _  until @xmath114 for the hllc runs ) , or until the energy injection scale ( @xmath115 ) , for the simulations that show no or little inertial range ( ` tvd_hlle ` ) .",
    "the bottleneck effect is a viscous phenomenon which is also observed in direct numerical simulations . however , in the present context where viscosity is of numerical origin , it is at the very least questionable if a pronounced bottleneck is a desirable feature of the modeling . in astrophysical flows , where the reynolds numbers are typically very large , this pile up of energy at large scales is unphysical and could affect the quantitative and qualitative outcome of a simulation @xcite .",
    "a quantification of the bottleneck effect in terms of the energy budget is discussed in section [ sec : results.energy.cumulative ] .    at even larger scales ,",
    "an inertial range ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 , see figure [ fig : energy.flux ] ) seems to be recovered by the least dissipative schemes ( ppm and wenoz with hllc ) in the region @xmath118 . `",
    "ppm_hlle ` and ` tvd_hlle ` have a more limited region , a few wave numbers at most , that could be interpreted as being an inertial range .",
    "we note that this resolution is not particularly high in comparison with state of the art @xcite , but it would already correspond to an extremely high resolution in global simulations that typically have @xmath119 zones across the turbulent region @xcite .    the overall behavior of the spectra , as obtained by all schemes , is consistent with kolmogorov s theory of turbulence .",
    "the anisotropic contributions to the angle - integrated spectra are too small to be detected in our data .          at very small scales ( @xmath2 several grid points )",
    "the dynamics is dominated by the numerical viscosity .",
    "this can be estimated from the residual of the energy equation or , equivalently , by the effective numerical viscosity @xmath120 ( equation [ eq : effective.viscosity ] ) .",
    "the latter is shown in figure [ fig : effective.viscosity ] for all schemes and resolutions .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the numerical viscosity provided by all numerical schemes is not constant , but differs by roughly an order of magnitude between low and high @xmath109 .",
    "having a wave number dependent viscosity is a desirable feature expected in any les model ( explicit or otherwise ) .",
    "nevertheless , this makes the definition and calculation of the effective reynolds number achieved in a simulation ambiguous .",
    "meaningful ways to estimate it for have been proposed @xcite and they can be used to ease the comparison between different simulations and assess their quality .",
    "however , one has to be very careful while using any quoted `` reynolds number '' from an , to estimate things like the dynamical range achieved by a simulation , because the dissipative properties of differ considerably from the ones of the true navier - stokes equations .",
    "two other features can be observed in most of the numerical viscosity profiles .",
    "first , many of them exhibit a sudden reversal at high wave numbers .",
    "this is due to the fact that the numerical viscosity does not behave like a shear viscosity so that , although the numerical diffusion is strong at those scales , the numerical viscosity appears small because of a partial decoupling between vorticity and dissipation .",
    "second , at high resolution and at the largest scales , the numerical viscosity is close to zero or even slightly negative .",
    "the reason is that the residual of equation oscillates around zero and it is too small to be reliably extracted from our data : a much longer integration time would be needed to accumulate enough statistics for it .",
    "finally , a comparison between the numerical viscosity reveals two interesting effects .",
    "first , by comparing ` ppm_hllc ` and ` ppm_hlle ` , we see that the choice of the riemann solver affects the viscosity at basically all scales .",
    "second , if we compare ` ppm_hllc ` , ` ppm_hllc_cfl0.8 ` and ` wenoz_hllc ` , we see that doubling the timestep appears to have an effect comparable to the difference between the ppm and wenoz reconstructions at intermediate scales ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "so far we have been concerned with the energy decay rate from the largest scales , which we have shown to be well captured by the ( section [ sec : results.energy.decay ] ) , and with the energy transfer in the inertial range , which we have seen to be described accurately only at much higher resolutions ( section [ sec : results.energy.spectra ] ) . in a turbulent flow both of these aspects are important and a good should display a distribution of energy across vortical structures at different scales that is as close as possible to the asymptotic one . obviously , there is a limit to the accuracy that any can achieve at a fixed resolution .",
    "here , we make this statement more quantitative by considering the amount of kinetic energy that is well resolved by each simulation at a given resolution .",
    "we introduce the cumulative energy spectrum , the integral of the energy spectrum : @xmath122 this quantity is plotted in figure [ fig : cumulative.energy ] , where it is normalized by @xmath123 to obtain the cumulative distribution function of the kinetic energy . as a reference , we also show the cumulative energy spectrum estimated from kolmogorov s theory : @xmath124 we find that as the resolution increases , all schemes appear to be converging to the predictions of kolmogorov s theory . the results at finite resolution , however , are not encouraging : at @xmath8 only @xmath125 or less of the kinetic energy is in well resolved structures , while the other @xmath125 have piled up at rather large scale , with a cumulative excess of @xmath126 at the grid scale , mostly because of the bottleneck effect . at higher resolutions , the amount of kinetic energy well captured by the increases , but at @xmath9 this is still only about @xmath127 of the energy and there is still a cumulative excess of over @xmath128 at the grid scale ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the @xmath10law ( equation [ eq:45law ] ) is not a - priori valid in the regime of turbulence we are considering .",
    "however , the @xmath10law has been numerically verified to hold also in some situations outside the domain of validity of its derivation .",

    "we can see that the transverse spectrum follows qualitatively the same trend as the 3d spectrum in terms of convergence .",

    "our analysis focused on the fidelity with which the turbulent cascade is represented in each model . in particular , we performed an analysis both in fourier space ( with the velocity power - spectra and the energy flux ) and in physical space ( with the 3@xmath16 order structure functions ) . finally , we measured the numerical viscosity of each scheme from the residual of the specific kinetic energy equation .",
    "we found that , on the one hand , all of the numerical setups are able to accurately capture the decay rate of kinetic energy from the injection scale , with errors at the few @xmath153 level already at @xmath81 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath154 for ` ppm_hllc_n128 ` ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a large fraction of the energy is at unresolved scales where it piles up due to the bottleneck effect and an inertial range appears only at the highest resolutions ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "even at this resolution , which would be difficult to achieve in global simulations , only roughly @xmath155 ( the exact number depends on the scheme , see section [ sec : results.energy.cumulative ] ) of the energy is resolved , the remaining @xmath126 accumulates as excess energy at intermediate scales ( the cumulative energy excess at the grid scale alone is as large as @xmath128 of the total energy ) .",
    "current simulations have resolutions of at most of @xmath156 points covering the gain region @xcite ( the energy injection scale ) .",
    "based on our analysis we expect that at these resolutions even the energy decay rate from the largest scales will not be completely converged , but will show errors of up to tens of percent , depending on the numerical scheme ( see section [ sec : results.energy.decay ] ) . at smaller scales ,",
    "the dynamics is going to be completely dominated by the bottleneck effect .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite , based on the use of global simulations reaching a maximum resolution of @xmath157 grid points covering radially the extent of the gain region .",
    "based on our findings , we expect that , if the resolution in global simulations is increased by a factor @xmath158 from the one of @xcite , the decay rate will be converged to within a few @xmath153 of the asymptotic value .",
    "this implies that the ratio between thermal and kinetic energy , a crucial quantity for the onset of the explosion , will also be converged to within a few @xmath153 , at least when the energy injection rate changes slowly compared to the eddy turnover time ( which is roughly @xmath159 in a @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , while the lead up to explosion occurs over a larger timescale of a few hundred milliseconds , the transition to explosion can happen over much shorter timescales ( one turnover time or less ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the dynamics of the cascade over smaller time and length scales in the gain region also needs to be captured correctly since changes in the energy input rate on such short time scales will yield an inaccurate representation of the energy on large scales due to the bottleneck effect .",
    "this could require an increase of resolution by a factor @xmath160 with respect to current high - resolution simulations .",
    "additional work using semi - global or global simulations will be required to more firmly establish the resolutions requirements at the transition of the explosion .",
    "concerning the properties of anisotropic turbulence in our simulations , we found anisotropy contributions to the energy spectrum and to the angle - averaged formulation of the @xmath10law to be subdominant : the accuracy with which the @xmath10law is satisfied is limited only by the employed resolution and the energy spectrum appears to be consistent with kolmogorov @xmath0 scaling .",
    "we also found the transverse energy spectrum with respect to the direction of anisotropy , a quantity typically computed in simulations , to overestimate the bottleneck with respect to the angle - integrated 3d spectrum .",
    "for this reason , we recommend future studies of to supplement ( or replace ) the analysis of the transverse spectrum with the analysis of the 3@xmath16 order , angle - integrated , structure function ( or , where possible , with the 3d spectrum itself ) .",
    "our results are , of course , dependent on the choice of the numerical scheme .",
    "in particular , we found significant differences in the dissipative properties of schemes employing the hllc riemann solver with respect to schemes using the more dissipative hlle solver .",
    "the reconstruction order of the scheme is also important , although , while significant differences are found between tvd and ppm , the differences between ppm and wenoz are much more minute ( despite wenoz being significantly more computationally expensive than ppm ) . in the end",
    ", none of the schemes we considered seems to be able to yield an accurate representation of the kinetic energy distribution across different scales at an affordable resolution for global simulations .",
    "a possible way forward would be to adopt low - dissipation numerical schemes especially designed for the use in , such as the methods proposed by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "implementing and testing these schemes will be subject of future work .",
    "an important limitation of the present work is that we considered a very idealized setup . on the one hand , this allows us to benchmark the behavior of in a controlled environment . on the other hand , our simulations can not fully capture all features of the turbulent convective flow in a . unlike the situation in a ccsn , our local simulations did not include a vertical advective velocity field that is due to the accretion of the stellar mantle .",
    "however , the advective velocities are nearly constant in the regions of interest and galilean invariance ensures that our results are unaffected .",
    "more limiting is the local nature of our simulations and the inevitable choice of boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , our simulations could not take into account spatial variations in gravity and the large - scale radial convergence of the flow in globally spherical problems like collapsing stars .",
    "addressing these issues will also be subject of future work .",
    "in this appendix we present a brief discussion of the importance of turbulent pressure in the explosion of massive stars . to set the stage",
    ", we will briefly summarize what is known of the dynamics of the most common class of e that are relevant for our later discussion .",
    "this is done for the benefit of readers that are not supernova specialists and it is not meant to be a complete review of the status of the field , for which we refer , instead , to the reviews of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "next , we will discuss the role of turbulence and , in particular , of turbulent pressure on the explosion mechanism , in light of some recent results @xcite .      towards the end of their evolution , massive stars form massive ( @xmath161 solar mass ) iron cores at their center .",
    "since the iron nucleus has the largest binding energy per nucleon , no energy can be extracted from nuclear fusion beyond iron .",
    "the iron core is essentially inert and supported against gravity only by the degeneracy pressure of relativistic electrons .",
    "the mass of the iron core increases with time as more iron - group material is added by silicon shell burning .",
    "electron capture on protons , which becomes energetically favorable at high densities , depletes the core of electrons and thus reduces the pressure supporting it against gravity .",
    "eventually , the core becomes dynamically unstable and collapses .    during the collapse , the subsonically collapsing inner core ( @xmath162 solar masses ) contracts until it reaches densities comparable to that in atomic nuclei ( @xmath163 ) . at this point ,",
    "the nuclear equation of state stiffens ( due to the strong nuclear force ) .",
    "this halts the collapse of the inner core .",
    "it stops , bounces back and a is formed .",
    "the outer core , however , is still collapsing supersonically and a strong shock wave is launched at the interface between the inner and outer core .",
    "it was once thought that this shock wave would travel outwards dynamically , depositing its energy in the outer layers of the star , causing the explosion .",
    "however , multiple numerical simulations performed over multiple decades have consistently shown that the initial shock fails to explode the star .",
    "instead , it stalls due to energy losses to the dissociation of heavy nuclei into free nucleons and to the emission of neutrinos that stream away from the neutrino - semitransparent regions behind the shock @xcite .",
    "the shock generally stalls within only a few tens of milliseconds of core bounce and turns into an accretion shock standing at a radius of @xmath164 .",
    "the accretion rate through the shock is so high ( a fraction of a solar mass per second ) that , if nothing revitalizes the shock within @xmath165 seconds , the gravitational force would overwhelm the nuclear repulsion force , collapsing the core of the supernova to a black hole , precluding explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    during this time , however , the will release a significant fraction of its binding energy in the form of neutrinos ( of order @xmath166 ) .",
    "converting a few percent of that energy into kinetic energy would be enough to unbind the stellar envelope and power the supernova explosion . in the standard neutrino mechanism",
    "it is theorized that a small fraction neutrinos emitted from the edge of the protoneutron star is re - absorbed in the region right behind the stalled shock .",
    "the deposition of neutrino energy leads to higher thermal pressure so that the shock can eventually overcome the ram pressure of accretion and accelerates in a run - away process @xcite .",
    "turbulence in the heating region behind the shock increases the time a fluid parcel spends in that region and , importantly , turbulent pressure helps in overcoming the ram pressure of accretion ( see next section and @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , presently unclear if neutrino heating ( even if aided by turbulence in launching the explosion ) is able to provide enough energy to power the explosions to the energies inferred from astronomical observations",
    ".      simulations @xcite have shown that turbulence and , in particular , turbulent pressure behind the shock , could play an important role in aiding the explosion . to see why this is the case",
    ", we consider the rankine - hugoniot momentum condition for a standing accretion shock in a supernova core , @xmath167 =    \\rho_d ( v_d^r)^2 + p_d - \\rho_u ( v_u^r)^2 - p_u,\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the shock speed and @xmath169 and @xmath170 denote the downstream and upstream values respectively . for the purpose of our discussion",
    ", we can assume the upstream gas to be cold and free - falling : @xmath171 for the shock to expand we must then have @xmath172 in the presence of turbulence , @xcite suggested to modify equation in a way akin to a reynolds decomposition and write it as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the average velocity and @xmath175 is the turbulent velocity .",
    "although not entirely rigorous , equation has been shown to be well verified in the numerical simulations if angular averages are used to compute the respective quantities @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that the turbulent pressure expressed in this fashion can exceed 50% of the thermal pressure , making a very significant contribution to the momentum balance in .",
    "going beyond the arguments of @xcite , we can reinterpret equation as being the rankine - hugoniot condition for a fluid with a modified equation of state , which has two separate internal degrees of freedom : thermodynamical and turbulent . to this aim",
    ", we express @xmath176 in terms of the specific turbulent energy @xmath177 noting that @xmath178 and using the fact that @xmath179 in turbulence , to obtain @xmath180 assuming the pressure varies like @xmath181 , and substituting into , we find @xmath182 where @xmath6 is the thermodynamical adiabatic index , @xmath183 is the downstream thermal energy and @xmath5 is the equivalent adiabatic index associated with anisotropic turbulence . since @xmath184 , we see that turbulent energy is more efficient , per unit specific internal energy , at pushing the shock than thermal energy .",
    "we point out that , if equation is dropped and turbulence is assumed to be isotropic , then @xmath185 , which is still larger than @xmath186 , but not as large as for the anisotropic case .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that anisotropic turbulence has an anisotropic pressure , which is stronger in the radial direction .    in both cases , since the total energy is conserved , the relevant quantity is the ratio @xmath187 . from standard turbulent phenomenology",
    "we expect that this ratio will only depend on macroscopic parameters , such as the net heating rate , the accretion rate and so on , and not on the details of the viscosity .",
    "for this reason , we expect this ratio to be correctly captured in achieving a sufficiently high resolution .    as a final remark",
