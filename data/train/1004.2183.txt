    "we consider the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xmath0 in which @xmath1 depends upon the spatial variables @xmath2 , and the temporal variable @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is equal to either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "this equation is a generalization to two spatial dimensions of the well - known korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath7 and has been derived as a model in the study of the transverse stability of the line solitary waves , i.e. , the stability of the solitary waves of the kdv equation with respect to two - dimensional perturbations @xcite . in particular , it arises as a model for long waves in the water - wave problem , in the absence of surface tension when @xmath8 , and in the presence of a strong surface tension when @xmath9 . the equation with @xmath8 ( negative dispersion )",
    "is also called the kp - ii equation , whereas the one with @xmath9 ( positive dispersion ) is called the kp - i equation .",
    "it turns out that the stability properties of the line solitary waves strongly depend upon the sign of @xmath4 : when @xmath8 the line solitary waves are transversely stable , and when @xmath8 they are unstable @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well - known solitary waves , the kdv equation possesses a family of periodic traveling waves . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the stability of these periodic waves as solutions of the kp equation , i.e. , their transverse stability . as solutions of the kdv equation ,",
    "the stability of these periodic traveling waves is quite well - understood , though the results are less complete than those for solitary waves .",
    "in contrast to the case of localized solutions , for periodic waves of dispersive equations there are mainly to types of stability results : nonlinear ( orbital ) stability with respect to periodic perturbations which have the same period as the traveling wave , and spectral stability with respect to non - periodic ( localized or bounded ) perturbations .",
    "the question of nonlinear stability with respect to non - periodic perturbations is widely open , so far . for the kdv",
    ", it has been recently shown that the periodic traveling waves are orbitally stable with respect to periodic perturbations @xcite , and spectrally stable with respect to non - periodic perturbations @xcite .    very recently , johnson and zumbrun @xcite derived an instability criterion for the transverse instability of periodic waves for the generalized kp equation , with respect to perturbations which are periodic in the direction of propagation and have long wavelengths in the transverse direction .",
    "in contrast , we restrict here to the case of small periodic waves , and consider the question of spectral stability for more general perturbations for the kp - i equation , and for the same type of perturbations for the kp - ii equation .",
    "a particularity of the kp equation is that the spectral problem can not be directly formulated in terms of the spectrum of a linear operator , because of the mixed time - space derivative @xmath10 appearing in .",
    "we present a functional set - up which leads to such a formulation , for both periodic and non - periodic perturbations . for periodic perturbations ,",
    "we use the invertibility of the operator @xmath11 when restricted to a space of periodic functions with zero mean , and for non - periodic perturbations we rely upon floquet theory for differential operators with periodic coefficients and the invertibility of the operator @xmath12 . for the analysis of the spectra of the resulting operators we rely upon several tools from the perturbation theory for linear operators , which turn out to be suitable for the analysis of spectra of differential operators with periodic coefficients @xcite .",
    "in addition , we use the decomposition of these operators in the product of a skew - adjoint with a self - adjoint operator , and a counting result which relates the number of unstable eigenvalues of the product operator to the number of negative eigenvalues of the self - adjoint operator @xcite .",
    "we focus on the kp - i equation , for which we show that the small periodic waves are transversely unstable , with respect to both types of perturbations . for the kp - ii equation ,",
    "a complete analysis of the spectra turns out to be more difficult , because of the different behavior of the dispersion relation . restricting to perturbations which are periodic in the direction of propagation and have long wavelengths in the transverse direction ,",
    "we show that the small periodic waves are spectrally stable with respect to such perturbations .",
    "in particular , these results show that the periodic waves have the same stability properties as the solitary waves , but under the restriction to long wavelength transverse perturbations for the kp - ii equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s:2 ]",
    ", we describe the family of the one - dimensional periodic traveling waves of the kp equation and give a parameterization of the small waves . the spectral stability problem is first formulated in section  [ s:3 ] , and then reformulated for periodic perturbations in section  [ ss : specper ] , and for non - periodic perturbations in section  [ ss : bloch ] .",
    "the results in these latter two sections are presented for the kp - i equation , but it is easily seen that the same results hold for the kp - ii equation .",
    "we discuss the spectra of the resulting linear operators , and show the transverse spectral instability of the small periodic waves of the kp - i equation for periodic perturbations in section  [ s:4 ] , and for non - periodic perturbations in section  [ s:5 ] . in section  [ s:6 ] , we prove the transverse spectral stability result for the periodic waves of the kp - ii equation mentioned above , and we conclude with a brief discussion in section  [ s:7 ] .",

    "this type of approach to transverse spectral stability of periodic waves can be adapted to other two - dimensional dispersive models , e.g. , generalized kp equations , boussinesq systems , equations of schrdinger type .",
    "however , one has to restrict to periodic waves of small amplitude , since we strongly rely upon perturbation arguments for linear operators . for large waves , we mention the approach in @xcite which leads to instability criteria , and in the particular case of integrable equations , so also for the kp equation",
    ", one could take advantage of the integrability and explicitly compute the spectra of the linear operators ( e.g. , see @xcite for such an approach in the case of the kdv equation ) .",
    "finally , we point out that these results concern only the spectral stability of the periodic waves , the question of nonlinear stability being widely open .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the recent methods developed in @xcite for the transverse nonlinear instability of the solitary waves , can be adapted to periodic waves .",
    "in particular , these would lead to a transverse nonlinear instability result for the periodic waves of the kp - i equation ."
