    "blazars are a subgroup of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "they have relativistic jets that are believed to be directed along the line of sight ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the emission from blazars can be detected in a very wide range of wavelengths from radio to tev @xmath5-ray regions , with strong variability on various time - scales ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is characterized by non - thermal continuum spectra that consist of low and high - energy components .",
    "the low - energy component is believed to be synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the emission of this component is highly polarized ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the high - energy component is not fully understood .",
    "the most plausible scenario is that it is emission via inverse compton scattering of synchrotron emission and/or external photons ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "blazars are classified into two categories : bl  lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal continuum emission is dominant in bl  lac objects , while broad emission lines from agn characterize fsrqs .",
    "bl  lac objects are further classified into three subtypes based on the peak frequency of synchrotron emission : high- , intermediate- , and low - energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbl , ibl , and lbl ) . the peak frequency lies higher than , around , and lower than the optical band in hbl , ibl , and lbl , respectively .",
    "multi - wavelength observations are essential to study blazars because of their emission in a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the multi - wavelength study of blazars has recently entered a new era owing to @xmath5-ray observations obtained with the fermi satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the high - energy component , for example , is expected to be revealed by the study of temporal variations in seds obtained with fermi . among the multi - wavelength study ,",
    "optical data is important to understand the sed variations , because the optically - thin synchrotron emission in this band allows us to estimate basic physical parameters in the emitting region . for follow - up ground - based observations of fermi blazars",
    ", we executed photopolarimetric monitoring of 42 blazars from 2008 to 2010 .",
    "we obtained simultaneous optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data using the `` kanata '' 1.5-m telescope .",
    "our observation provides one of the largest data sets of blazars in terms of variations in color and polarization on a time scale of days  months ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of simple correlation studies between the flux ( , or luminosity ) , color , polarization degree ( @xmath6 ) , and polarization angle ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we also discuss the implications for the mechanism of time variations in blazars obtained from our observations .",
    "a detailed study of polarization and the data , itself , will be published in a forthcoming paper .    the behavior of colors gives us a clue to understand the mechanism of time variations in blazars .",
    "@xcite report a possible feature that both bl  lac and oj  287 became bluer when they were brighter ( also see , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed s5  0716@xmath3714 , and found that a bluer - when - brighter trend was seen only in its faint state .",
    "its bluer - when - brighter trend was later confirmed in variations on a time scale shorter than days in its bright state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite report that the bluer - when - brighter trend in bl  lac was only observed in short - term variations , and not prominent in long - term ones . @xcite",
    "performed multi - band photometric observations of ao  0235@xmath3164 for four years , and found a bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "as reported in those past studies , the bluer - when - brighter trend has been a well - observed feature in blazars , while its universality has not been established .",
    "systematic observations of multiple sources have also been performed in order to establish a characteristic feature of color variations in blazars .",
    "@xcite performed observations of five blazars .",
    "their observation showed that 3c  66a only exhibited a bluer - when - brighter trend , while the other objects showed no significant correlation of the flux and color .",
    "@xcite investigated variations in color of eight blazars .",
    "the bluer - when - brighter trend was confirmed in five blazars . among the other three objects , 3c  345 showed no correlation of the flux and color , and 3c  454.3 and pks  0420@xmath201 showed a reddening trend when they brightened .",
    "this `` redder - when - brighter '' trend in 3c  454.3 was confirmed in later observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is currently unclear whether the bluer - when - brighter trend is universal in blazars .    as well as the color variation ,",
    "the polarimetric variation in the optical band has been extensively investigated in blazars .",
    "the temporal variation in polarization has , in general , been considered to be erratic in blazars ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , a few cases have been reported in which the increase in @xmath6 was associated with flares of the total flux .",
    "for example , @xmath6 of mrk  421 increased to @xmath8  % associated with its outburst in 1997 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant correlation of the flux and @xmath6 was also detected in ao  0235@xmath3164 in 2006 ( @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , several rotation episodes of @xmath7 have been found during flares ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in general",
    ", the number of polarimetric observations has been much smaller than that of color observations .",
    "high - frequency , long - term polarimetric observations are required in order to find universal aspects that are possibly present .    the aim of this paper is to investigate universal aspects in blazar variability in the optical  nir bands .",
    "we search for them with a simple correlation study between the flux , color , and polarization . in section  2 , we describe the observation method and reduction processes . in section  3 , first",
    ", we shortly introduce the basic properties of our sample ( subsection  3.1 ) .",
    "then , we report on the results of our correlation studies of the flux and color ( subsection  3.2 ) , and the flux and polarization ( subsection  3.3 ) .",
    "we also search for rotation events of polarization in subsection  3.3 . in subsection  3.4 , we report on the dependence of the degree of variability on different luminosities and synchrotron peak frequencies . in section  4 , we discuss the implication to the mechanism of blazar variability obtained from our observation .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  5 .",

    "we used trispec attached to the 1.5-m `` kanata '' telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory .",

    "the photometry of blazars was performed in a standard procedure of ccd images ; after making dark - subtracted and flat - fielded images , the magnitudes were measured using the aperture photometry technique .",

    "these correspond to 34 pixels on the optical ccd .",
    "since the pixel scale of the nir insb arrays of trispec is large ( @xmath443  arcsec ) , the nir images were slightly de - focused in order to avoid undersampling . on the nir arrays , the fwhm of an point source was adjusted to be @xmath444 pixels , which correspond to the aperture size of the nir images .",
    "it is well known that the photometry of a part of blazars is complicated by the presence of a host galaxy component .",

    "unfortunately , the angular resolution of our instrument is too low to accurately estimate the host galaxy contamination .",
    "hence , we performed no correction for it in the present work .",

    "the correction for the interstellar extinction , @xmath18 , and the color excess were performed according to @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and color presented in this paper are corrected values .",
    "the correction was not done for the historical variation range given in table  2 .",
    "a set of polarization parameters was calculated from four consecutive images , which were obtained with half - wave - plate angles of @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , and @xmath448 .",
    "we took 12 sets of images for each object on one night , from which three sets of polarimetric data were obtained .",
    "we confirmed that the instrumental polarization was smaller than 0.1  % in the @xmath10-band using observations of unpolarized standard stars .",
    "hence , we applied no correction for it .",
    "the zero point of the polarization angle was corrected as the standard system ( measured from north to east ) .",
    "since we present no discussion about intra - day variability in this paper , we only use nightly - averaged photometric and polarimetric data .",
    "observations were sometimes carried out under bad sky conditions .",
    "some data obtained under such conditions have very large errors .",
    "they could just disrupt systematic trends , which may exist in blazar variability . in this paper",

    "in addition to the @xmath455-correction , a red - shift correction was performed to @xmath4 of the open circles by multiplying @xmath4 by @xmath462 .",
    "an anti - correlation is apparent between @xmath450 and @xmath4 .",
    "the anti - correlation is more emphasized between the corrected @xmath450 and @xmath4 , as indicated by the open circles .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)fig2.eps    the anti - correlation between @xmath450 and @xmath4 is well known as the `` blazar sequence '' , which was first proposed by @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the blazar sequence can be explained by the idea that a synchrotron cooling works more severely for low - energy electrons in more powerful blazars . as a result , it leads to smaller @xmath4 in them .",
    "however , it has been suspected that the blazar sequence scenario involves serious problems about the selection effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . when the blazar sequence is evaluated , a problem is the high variability not only in @xmath450 , but also @xmath463 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneous measurements of @xmath464 and @xmath4 are , hence , required .",
    "the @xmath4 of our sample are mostly quoted from @xcite , who analyzed multi - wavelength data taken in the almost same observation periods as those of our monitoring .",
    "hence , our data can provide one of the most reliable tests for the blazar sequence scenario in terms of simultaneous measurements of @xmath450 and @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : flx2nu ] , the result is apparently compatible with the blazar sequence scenario originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "the blazars with a high @xmath4 of @xmath465 had @xmath466  mag fainter than those with a low @xmath4 of @xmath467 .",
    "it is evident that our observation did not cover the faintest states in several blazars , as can be seen in table  2 .",
    "the observed faintest states in a part of lbls and fsrqs are , in particular , @xmath444  mag brighter than the previously recorded faintest states",
    ". however , the anticorrelation between @xmath450 and @xmath4 still appears even if @xmath464 are estimated from the faintest states ever recorded .",
    "this indicates that the flux variability actually has no major affect on the blazar sequence scenario .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)fig3.eps    we comment on the selection effects .",

    "objects are detectable over this curve in a magnitude - limited sample . as suggested by this curve , the apparent lack of low @xmath450 and low @xmath4 sources could be due to a selection effect present in magnitude - limited samples .",

    "first , it is required that a rotation episode is well sampled when it is proposed to be a real one . a rotation episode indicated by only a few data points ,",
    "can not be distinguished from results of a random walk in the @xmath449 plane .",
    "second , a rotation event would more likely to be real when it has a larger variation amplitude in @xmath7 .",
    "an apparent rotation having a small amplitude of @xmath572 can be readily produced by a composition of a few flares having different @xmath7 .",
    "third , the appearance of a rotation event should not be changed by a small shift of the origin of @xmath565 . as mentioned above ,",
    "a part of the rotation event in pks  1510@xmath2089 is quite sensitive to a small change of the origin of @xmath565 .",
    "finally , the temporal behavior in the @xmath449 plane should be carefully checked not only during the rotation event , but also before and after it .",
    "if the observed average of @xmath565 is significantly deviated from the origin , a stationary or long - term variation component in polarization could be present .",
    "then , polarization variations should be discussed after the long - term component is subtracted from the observation .",
    "( 170mm,170mm)fig19.eps    in this subsection , we report on the dependence of the degree of variability in the flux , color , and @xmath6 on @xmath463 .",
    "the @xmath4 is related to the luminosity of the blazars in our sample ( see subsection  3.1 ) .",
    "we note that variation amplitudes may be underestimated because blazars generally have a variation time - scale longer than our observation period . to minimize this observation bias , we calculated the slope in the color - magnitude diagram , @xmath573 , as well as ordinary peak - to - peak amplitudes .",

    "all panels in figure  [ fig : var2 ] suggest that the degrees of variation were low in high @xmath4 , or faint objects",
    ". they can be high in low @xmath4 , or bright objects .",
    "the poorly observed objects represented by the open circles tend to be distributed in low variability regions compared with the others .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as underestimations of the variation amplitudes in those objects due to the short period of observations .",
    "several fsrqs , particularly , 3c  273 and qso  0454@xmath2234 , exhibit a small variation amplitude , although they have a quite low @xmath579 .",
    "this atypical feature can be understood by large contamination of the thermal emission from accretion disks .",
    "those invariable component probably made the variability of the jet component small , apparently .",
    "thus , the variation amplitudes of poorly observed objects ( the open circles ) and fsrqs ( the filled triangles ) can be considered as lower limits of the amplitudes .",

    "@xcite also analyzed the spectral slope variability for eight bl  lac objects , and reported that all objects showed bluer - when - brighter trends .",

    "we propose that there are two factors that can disturb the general bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "first , a strong contribution of a blue thermal emission from the accretion disk leads to a redder - when - brighter trend .",
    "a typical case is 3c  454.3 , as shown in panel  ( b ) of figure  [ fig : exam ] .",
    "the observed color variation suggests that the redder - when - brighter trend was observed only when the objects were faint .",
    "this color behavior is consistent with the scenario that the contribution of the thermal emission from the accretion disk becomes strong when the synchrotron emission from the jet weakened ( @xcite ) . even in the redder - when - brighter objects",
    ", our observation revealed that the bluer - when - brighter trend appeared when they were bright .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)fig20.eps    second , the bluer - when - brighter trend could be hidden if there are multiple variation components having different bluer - when - brighter sequences .",

    "panel  ( f ) of figure  [ fig : exam ] shows the light curve , color , and color - magnitude diagram of pks  1502@xmath3106 .",
    "a bluer - when - brighter trend was not detected in the whole data of this object , but significantly detected in each year , as reported in sub - subsection  3.2.2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pks1502col2 ] shows the @xmath527@xmath528 diagram of pks  1502@xmath3106 .",
    "the filled circles and crosses represent data obtained in 2008 and 2009 , respectively .",

    "the dashed lines in the figure represents the best - fitted linear regression models for each year .",
    "the slope of the 2008 data in the @xmath527@xmath528 diagram is clearly different from that of 2009 ; a steep slope in the 2009 data compared with the 2008 one . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : exam ] , short - term flares are apparently superimposed on a long - term outburst component in the 2009 light curve .",
    "the long - term component reached the maximum at the beginning of our 2009 observation , and then started a gradual decay through that year .",
    "hence , the general trend seen in the @xmath527@xmath528 diagram of the 2009 data actually originates from the long - term outburst component .",
    "in contrast , the object almost remained fainter than @xmath471 in 2008 , while several short - term flares brighter than @xmath471 were observed .",
    "there was no prominent outburst component in 2008 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the 2009 season , the @xmath527@xmath528 slopes of the early phase of the short - term flares were possibly analogous to those in 2008 .",
    "the thick solid lines in figure  [ fig : pks1502col2 ] represent the rising phases of the prominent short - term flares peaked at jd  2454951 and 2454960 .",

    "the dashed line in the lower panel indicates the @xmath527@xmath528 slope of the 2008 data .",
    "the figure suggests that there were stages of shallow @xmath527@xmath528 slopes during the early rising phases of the flares in 2009 .",
    "after these stages , the slope appears to become very steep near the flare peaks .",
    "this may be a sign of spectral hysteresis , which was frequently observed in short - term flares , as mentioned in sub - subsection  3.2.3 .",
    "the early shallow @xmath527@xmath528 slopes look close to the slope of the short - term flare in 2008 .",
    "those observations give us an idea that the color behavior of the short - term flares in 2008 was the same as that in 2009 .",
    "in addition , the color of the outburst component in 2009 was probably redder than the short - term flares . as well as pks  1502@xmath3106 , pks  0048@xmath2097 and h  1722@xmath3119 clearly showed different color behavior in each year , as shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : exam ] .",
    "those phenomena may also be due to the presence of a long - term component , whose color was different from that of short - term flares , and moreover , variable with time .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that correlation coefficients were low even in the bluer - when - brighter sources ; as shown in table  2 , @xmath583 was less than @xmath584 in more than half of objects .",
    "the low correlation - coefficients can be interpreted by the scenario that the observed color is a composition of short- and long - term components that have different bluer - when - brighter sequences .",
    "the two - component scenario has also been proposed to explain the color behavior of bl  lac ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the above two factors , namely the presence of the thermal disk emission and multiple synchrotron variation components , can disturb the general bluer - when - brighter trend in blazar variability .",
    "our observation overcomes those factors by covering a wide range of wavelengths , namely , the simultaneous optical and nir observations and a high sampling rate . those two advantages of our observation led to the high fraction of bluer - when - brighter objects compared with previous studies . in other words",
    ", one should carefully discuss apparent redder - when - brighter trends or achromatic variations observed in blazars , while taking into account the above two factors that can disturb the universal bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "it has been suspected that the bluer - when - brighter trend is common in bl  lac objects , but not in fsrqs because of a large contribution of thermal emission in fsrqs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our objects that were observed more than 10  times include seven fsrqs and seven lbls .",
    "the correlation analysis with all data sets showed that significant bluer - when - brighter trends were detected in two fsrqs and six lbls ( see table  2 ) .",
    "this result confirms the previous studies , which suggest that the color  flux correlation of fsrqs is different from that of bl  lac objects .",
    "however , the bluer - when - brighter trend was significantly detected even in the other four fsrqs when they were bright ( 3c  454.3 , pks  1510@xmath2089 , pks  1502@xmath3106 , and qso  0454@xmath2234 ) , as mentioned in sub - subsection  3.2.2 .",
    "hence , the jet emission in fsrqs presumably has the same color behavior as that in bl  lac objects .",
    "the relationships of @xmath527 and @xmath528 of 3c  454.3 and pks  1510@xmath2089 suggest that their variation components did not have a constant color , but a blueing trend with an increase in flux ( see figure  [ fig : pks1510ff ] and [ fig:3c454ff ] ) .",
    "alternatively , it can be interpreted with the scenario that two variation components had different time - scales and colors , as proposed above .",
    "a red and long - term outburst component would be dominant in their low flux regime .",
    "the redder - when - brighter trend was observed probably because an underlying source was the blue thermal emission .",
    "the emission from short - term flares would be dominant in the high - flux regime , resulting in the standard bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "this scenario is supported by the light curve structure ; short - term flares , making the objects brightest , were superimposed on long - term outburst components ( see figures  25 and 23 ) .    in general , variations on time - scales of months  years",
    "are expected to have larger amplitudes than those of days  weeks in blazars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . hence",
    ", the variation amplitudes reported in subsection  3.4 are considered to be those of the long - term variation component . in subsection  3.2.3",
    ", we reported that the color of the variation component was constant in most objects .",
    "since this constant - color feature is a result from the whole data set obtained during our observation period , it is probably a feature of the long - term variation component .",
    "thus , the implications for the blazar variability obtained from our observation are summarized below : the short - term flares on time scales of days ",
    "weeks tended to exhibit spectral hysteresis ; their rising phase was bluer than the decay phase around the flare maxima .",
    "they were occasionally superimposed on the long - term variations on time scales of months  years .",
    "the color of the long - term component was apparently constant .",
    "in addition to those short- and long - term synchrotron components , a stationary component was probably embedded .",
    "the bluer - when - brighter trend is commonly observed because this stationary component had a redder color than the variation components",
    ". a part of fsrqs has a blue and thermal emission as an underlying component .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the bluer - when - brighter trend in blazars .",
    "when we consider two distinct synchrotron components , the bluer - when - brighter trend could be explained if a flare component has a higher @xmath4 than an underlying component .",
    "even when we consider a single synchrotron component , it could be explained by a shift of its @xmath4 to a higher region . in either case ,",
    "high @xmath463 can be obtained by the injection of energy into emitting regions , and thereby , the increase of the number of high energy electrons .",
    "the most plausible scenario for the origin of the energy injection is internal shocks in relativistic shells ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . besides the energy injection scenario ,",
    "the bluer - when - brighter trend can be explained by a change in the beaming factor , @xmath585 , of the emitting region .",
    "this is because it leads to not only an apparent increase in the observed flux , @xmath586 , but also a shift of the observed frequency , @xmath587 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the short - term variations on a time scale of days ",
    "weeks tended to exhibit the spectral hysteresis in the @xmath527@xmath528 diagram , as reported in sub - subsection  3.2.3 .",
    "this hysteresis presumably has the same nature as the hysteresis which have been seen between the flux and color , or spectral index ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reproduce the hysteresis between the flux and spectral index using their model for the acceleration of electrons in a shock region .",
    "the fact that the short - term variations tended to exhibit the spectral hysteresis supports the energy injection scenario .",
    "it is difficult to explain such a hysteresis pattern with a change in @xmath585 .    the long - term variation components on a time scale of months  years apparently had a constant color .",
    "the bluer - when - brighter trend was observed because the underlying source was redder than the variation component , as mentioned in sub - subsection  3.2.3 and the last subsection .",
    "the emission of the underlying source is presumably synchrotron emission , because the thermal emission from agn should be much bluer than the synchrotron emission of the long - term variation component .",
    "the red color of the underlying source suggests that its @xmath4 is lower than that of the long - term component .    in subsection  3.4",
    ", we showed that a higher @xmath4 objects exhibited smaller variations all in the flux , color , and @xmath6 .",
    "based on the discussions in the last subsection , it suggests that the variation amplitude of the long - term component was small in a region of @xmath588 and vice versa .",
    "this is preferable for the scenario that the long - term variation is also attributed to the energy injection events .",
    "if changes in @xmath585 would be the major cause , it means an eccentric situation that @xmath585 changes only occur in components having high @xmath579 .",
    "otherwise , large variations would be observed in a region of @xmath588 when low @xmath579 components are amplified by an increase in @xmath585 .",
    "the energy injection scenario can explain the @xmath463 dependence of the variation amplitude without such an eccentric situation .",
    "the high fraction of bluer - when - brighter objects implies that there is a major mechanism common to blazar variations .",
    "the most plausible explanation is the energy injection scenario , as mentioned in the last subsection .",
    "the internal shock is a promising candidate for the mechanism of the energy injection to the emitting region . if the internal shock results in an aligned magnetic field in the emitting region , a universal aspect of polarization variations can be expected .",
    "in contrast to the strong correlation between the flux and color , the correlation between the flux and @xmath6 was weak ; 30  % and 12  % of the sample exhibited significant positive and negative correlations , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , these fractions of objects are too high to conclude that the polarization variations are completely random .",
    "it is possible that there is no universal law of polarization associated with blazar variations .",
    "if this is the case , our observation indicates that flares could occur independent of the structure of the magnetic field in the flaring source .",
    "alternatively , a universal law could be hidden in the observed polarization , although it was present .",
    "polarization can be described with two parameters , for example , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it can also be treated like a two - dimension vector with stokes @xmath449 parameters .",
    "this property of polarization is an important difference from that of color .",
    "the weak correlation of the flux and @xmath6 may be caused by the presence of two or more polarization components . even if a flare has specific @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", they would disappear in the observed @xmath6 and @xmath7 variations because of the superposition of other flares having different @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "based on this picture , we have developed a method to separate the observed polarization into two components : a short - term variation component having a positive correlation between the total and polarized fluxes , and a long - term one ( @xcite ) . applying this method to our blazar data",
    ", we found that the behavior of polarization in oj  287 and s2  0109@xmath3224 can be explained with this two - component picture .",
    "the two - component picture is also supported by the color behavior as described in subsections  4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "there are three well - observed blazars in our sample which showed a significant negative correlation between the flux and @xmath6 : oj  49 , on  231 , and 3c  66a .",
    "in addition , temporary negative correlations were observed in bl  lac and oj  287 , as mentioned in subsection  3.3.2 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the observed @xmath449 of all those five objects do not center at the origins of @xmath449 , but concentrate around regions significantly apart from the origins .",
    "such distributions are also seen in their @xmath589 plane .",
    "these distributions strongly suggest the presence of long - term polarization components .",
    "the negative correlation means that the flux variations were associated with the systematic changes in polarization .",
    "if the long - term component is subtracted , the variations might change to those showing positive correlation .",
    "hence , the negative correlation can also be explained by the two - component scenario .",
    "we performed photopolarimetric monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and near - infrared band using the kanata telescope .",
    "our findings are summarized below :    * the bluer - when - brighter trend was observed in 28 blazars , which correspond to 88  % of our well - observed sample .",
    "our observation unambiguously confirmed that it is a universal aspect in blazars . *",
    "the redder - when - brighter trend was observed in three objects ( 3c  454.3 , pks  1510@xmath2089 , and pg  1553@xmath3113 ) when they were faint . even in those three objects",
    ", the bluer - when - brighter trends can be seen when they were bright . *",
    "the bluer - when - brighter trend was , in general , generated by a variation source apparently having a constant color and an underlying red source .",
    "* prominent short - term flares tended to exhibit a spectral hysteresis ; their rising phase was bluer than their decay phase around the flare maxima .",
    "* significant correlations of the flux and the polarization degree were observed only in 10 blazars , which correspond to 30  % of our well - observed sample .",
    "the correlation was weak compared with that between the flux and color . * the rotations of polarization",
    "were observed in pks  1510@xmath2089 , 3c  454.3 , and pks  1749@xmath3096 , and possibly in s5  0716 + 714 .",
    "we demonstrated that false events of polarization rotations could be detected in the case that multiple polarization components are present .",
    "* we found that the variation amplitudes were smaller in low @xmath4 objects all in the flux , color , and polarization degree .",
    "based on those results , we propose that there are several distinct variation sources on different time - scales , colors , and polarizations in blazars . both short- and long - term variation components are probably attributed to the energy injection into emitting sources , for example , with the internal shock in relativistic shells .",
