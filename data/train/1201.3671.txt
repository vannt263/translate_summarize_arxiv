    "this paper presents a euclidean 4d model that can be used to view and explain minkowski spacetime without resort to higher mathematics .",
    "the simple intuitive method presents the fundamental concepts underlying the theory of special relativity and enables the teacher to lead a student from euclidean geometry into flat spacetime .    for simplicity ,",
    "* _ temporal homogeneity _ *  @xcite and a flat  @xcite spacetime with no acceleration are assumed , and lighting effects are not considered . under these conditions flat minkowski spacetime is euclidean for an inertial observer .",
    "the corresponding model can then be viewed and animated based on 4d raytracing .    _ * temporal extrusion * _ of an inertial 3d object into 4-space along its normalized velocity 4-vector ( worldline ) , followed by the * _ lorentz transformation _ * ( length contraction and time dilation ) of the object into the inertial reference frame of the stationary camera are used to model object behavior .",
    "the camera can then be moved along the time axis , raytracing the 4d space , and creating an image collection that can subsequently be composed into a video sequence capturing the time - varying effects.@xcite    in the following sections we will : discuss our fundamental assumptions , and the minkowski 2d and 3d spacetime diagrams ; describe our model , and the construction of 4d objects from 3d objects ; and finally , demonstrate the resulting animations of 3d objects in 4d spacetime .",
    "[ sec : intro ]",
    "as pointed out in this journal,@xcite and demonstrated by terrell@xcite and penrose,@xcite the visual phenomena we explore here can be described as the combination of a pre - relativistic purely optical effect due to finite lightspeed that was discovered by roemer in 1677,@xcite and special relativity s four dimensional spacetime discovered by minkowski in 1908.@xcite the finite speed of light leads to effects analogous to those of sound , as in the case of locating the position of a fast high flying jet by the sound of its engines .",
    "finite and invariant lightspeed requires the physical phenomena predicted by special relativity : time dilation and length contraction .",
    "time dilation is observable only if there is a variation in the object during the viewing period , as in the muon particle s decay .",
    "length contraction is observable by differences in the geometry of a relativistic object at rest and in motion .",
    "relativistic 4d spacetime ( @xmath0 ) consisting of both space and time , is often labeled ( 3 + 1)d , referring to three spatial dimensions ( @xmath1 ) and one time dimension @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , a 3d spacetime ( @xmath3 ) could be referred to as ( 2 + 1)d , which is to say containing two spatial dimensions ( @xmath4 ) and one time dimension @xmath2 .",
    "( 1 + 1)d and ( 2 + 1)d minkowski spacetime diagrams ]    the most convenient units for the purposes discussed here are _ * relativistic units * _ where @xmath5 .",
    "the benefit of using relativistic units is that the units along all the spacetime axes have the same scale , resulting in a lightray traveling one unit along the spatial axes for each unit it travels along the time axis .",
    "a lightray @xmath6 can thus be represented in a minkowski 2d spacetime diagram as a @xmath7 bisector , or in a 3d spacetime diagram as the surface of a right circular cone , both shown in figure  [ fig : mink2d ] .",
    "we will use the light - second , the distance light travels in a second , as the basic unit of measure in our discussion .",
    "an object s * _ worldline _ * is its 4d path through spacetime .",
    "the instantaneous direction of an object s worldline is the object s proper time axis .",
    "the slope of this proper time axis in the minkowski diagram represents the object s speed .",
    "the worldline through flat spacetime of an object with a constant velocity is a straight line .",
    "the normalized tangent to an object s worldline is the object s instantaneous velocity 4-vector .",
    "a 3d object can be created by * _ extruding _ *  @xcite a 2d object in a direction perpendicular to the 2d plane in which the object lies ( for example , by extruding a square from the @xmath8 plane along the @xmath9 axis ) .",
    "likewise , a 4d object can be created by extruding a 3d object in a direction orthogonal to the 3d hyperplane in which the object lies .",
    "a 4d example would be the extrusion of a cube from the @xmath10 3-space , along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "two examples are shown in figure  [ fig : fig322 ] .",
    "we call this * _ temporal extrusion _ * when a 3d object is extruded along its worldline .     cube & triangle : extruded then tessellated ]    raytracing@xcite is a geometric 3d image rendering algorithm that colors the pixel on a viewplane by sending a ray from the viewpoint , through a pixel on the viewplane , and out into the scene s 3-space where it may intersect the 2d surface element ( such as a triangle ) used to define the boundaries of a 3d object . the color of the object s surface at the intersection",
    "is used to color the corresponding pixel in the viewplane .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each of the pixels in the viewplane .",
    "howard  @xcite adapted the open - source 3d raytracer pov - ray version 2.0 to relativistic raytracing by changing the angle of incidence as a light ray passes from one inertial reference frame to another .",
    "we found it necessary to increase the model s flexibility in order to demonstrate the difference between finite lightspeed effects and relativistic effects .",
    "we have developed a simple four dimensional raytracer by globally extending a 3d raytracers@xcite vector math from 3d to 4d and adding a fourth component @xmath2 to the coordinate system .",
    "we constrained the lightrays to lie on the negative lightcone so the ray travels through the model at lightspeed .",
    "the resulting 4d raytracer can image a euclidean 4d space of 4d objects .",
    "it can be shown that the length of an object with an arbitrary constant relativistic  @xcite  velocity @xmath12 will contract in the direction of motion by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "it can also be shown that the proper duration between any two events on the relativistic object s worldline will expand ( dilate ) by the lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "this is known as * _ length contraction _ * and * _ time dilation _ * , respectively .",
    "any 3d object defined by bounding triangles such as the cube in figure  [ fig : fig322]a can be * _ temporally extruded _ * into a 4d hyperobject and inserted in the scene s",
    "4-space by extruding each @xmath15 of its @xmath16 individual triangles as follows .",
    "assuming that the triangle s vertices are defined by their 3d coordinates in 3-space , insert a @xmath2 component into each of the vertex coordinates and set @xmath2 to some constant value , say @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 .",
    "when performed on all three vertices @xmath19 , the 2d triangle @xmath15 will have a unique location in 4-space .",
    "temporal extrusion : triangle at rest extruded into prism ]    the object now lies embedded in the xyz hyperplane that is orthogonal to the @xmath2 axis at @xmath20 ( _ original object _ in figure  [ fig : ajp_ob2a ] ) .",
    "each of these triangles @xmath15 , and hence the object composed from them , can be extruded into the 4th dimension by duplicating the vertices of the triangles with lesser ( or greater ) values for the @xmath2 components .",
    "if the object is at rest in the camera frame , a constant @xmath21 can be added to the @xmath2 component of each of the object s original triangles in the @xmath17 hypersurface to create an @xmath22 duplicate triangle to be used as the object s position in the @xmath23 hypersurface .",
    "@xmath24    where @xmath25 refers to each of the original triangles , @xmath26 to each of the corresponding extruded triangles , and @xmath27 to each of the corresponding vertices that define each triangle pair .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ajp_ob2a ] where @xmath28 , connecting the three vertices ( @xmath29 in eqn  [ eqn : one ] ) of the original triangle @xmath15 with the respective vertices of the extruded triangle @xmath22 creates a 3d prism from the original triangle",
    ". thus the triangle @xmath15 exists only between @xmath17 and @xmath30 , inclusive .",
    "the prisms are then tessellated  @xcite into three adjacent tetrahedra as shown in figure  [ fig : fig322]e .",
    "the 3d simplices are necessary for the barycentric algorithm ( described below ) used to determine where , on the 3-manifold surface of the 4d object the intersection with the lightray occurs .",
    "temporal extrusion not parallel to t axis ]    an object s velocity is represented by changing the position of the extruded end of the triangle ( figure  [ fig : ajp_ob3a ] ) with respect to the original end : @xmath31 spatial units .",
    "the speed in the camera frame would thus be @xmath32 .",
    "canceling the units yields the dimensionless fraction @xmath33 .",
    "a lightray s slope @xmath34 is represented by both the diagonal lines and the surface of the lightcone of figure  [ fig : mink2d ] .",
    "for the general 3d case , where the distance traveled in time @xmath35 is @xmath36 , the speed would be @xmath37 , and eqn  [ eqn : one ] would become :    @xmath38      consider a camera at the origin , whose line - of - sight ( los ) is collinear with the @xmath39 axis .",
    "since a lightray s worldline as depicted in the spacetime diagram lies on the lightcone , an object must cross the lightcone in the diagram in order to be visible to the camera .",
    "in fact , the object is visible to the camera only while it is intersecting that lightcone whose apex is coincident with the camera ( assuming the camera is pointing at the object ) as shown in figure  [ fig : ajp_obj3 ] .",
    "temporal extrusion of moving object with lightcone ]    figure  [ fig : ajp_obj3 ] depicts a right circular hypercone in 4-space , whose symmetric axis is collinear with the @xmath40 axis , and whose apex is coincident with the camera at the origin @xmath41 .",
    "this hypercone s hypersurface , depicted by the inverted cone , has 3 dimensions , sufficient to contain the camera s focal point and the lightrays entering its lens .",
    "although a 3-manifold in 4-space , this hypercone is known as a * _ lightcone_*. a lightcone is thus the locus of all points that satisfy : @xmath42    note that the light travels from the object to the lightcone s apex at the origin . as depicted by the broken lines representing lightrays in figure  [ fig : ajp_obj3 ] , a camera located at the apex in this 4d model can see only those 3d objects whose extruded triangles ( tetrahedra triads ) intersect the lightcone .",
    "the only visible objects are those with vertex extrusion pairs @xmath43 of the original object and @xmath44 of its extruded end - cap , where    @xmath45    the intersecting portion of the extruded triangle is depicted by the triangle labeled _ visible intersection _ in figure  [ fig : ajp_obj3 ] .",
    "note that geometric distortion in the object is caused by the intersection of the triangle and the lightcone .",
    "an object in the lightcone is easily detected since a straight line can be intersected with a 3d object in euclidean 4-space in the same manner as a straight line is intersected with a 2d object in 3-space .",
    "there is no mathematical or geometric limit to an object s speed in the model , its velocity being the slope of the temporal extrusion vector . for real physical objects ,",
    "some physical mechanism must accelerate the object to the speed with which the object enters the model s laboratory inertial frame .",
    "we can assume with some confidence that this speed must be less than that of light .",
    "the physical objects will then maintain an extrusion vector with a @xmath46 slope of less than 1.0 , or an angle of less than @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath2 axis on the minkowski diagram as shown by @xmath47 in figure  [ fig : ajp_ob3a ] .",
    "since we are considering only uniformly moving objects , we can ignore the specifics of the spacetime rotation that yield the extrusion angle .",
    "@xcite    two classes of 4d objects have been implemented : one for the finite lightspeed objects and one for relativistic objects .",
    "the first is inserted into the scene without length contraction or time dilation as shown in figure  [ fig : ajp_obj3 ] , and the second is inserted with the lorentz transformation as shown in figure  [ fig : ajp_obj4 ] .",
    "conceptually , the former may be considered to have been measured in the laboratory inertial reference frame s subjective units ( it was already length - contracted and time - dilated ) , while in the latter case the object was measured in its own rest frame .",
    "the relativistic objects therefore must be length contracted and time dilated prior to insertion .",
    "lorentz transformed object ]    the animation procedure is straight forward . for example , to generate 20 seconds of animation at 10 frames per second ( @xmath48 ) , the procedure is as follows .    1 .",
    "beginning with the camera at ( @xmath49 ) , a view is rendered and saved .",
    "the camera is moved forward in time to ( @xmath50 ) , where @xmath51 and the view is rendered and saved ; [ sec : repeat ] 3 .",
    "repeat from step [ sec : repeat ] while @xmath52 .",
    "notice that the camera s spatial components ( @xmath1 ) do not change , only the time component of the camera position .",
    "crucial to the simplicity of the procedure is the fact that the 4d object s bounding surfaces ( and the tessellating tetrahedra that comprise those surfaces ) * _ do not change_*. the 4d world is * _ static_*. only the point of intersection of the lightcone changes as the camera and its lightcone progress along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "lightcone crossing events are detected by solving for the intersection of a lightray with each of an object s bounding tetrahedra .",
    "the set of lightrays is defined as that set of 4d straight lines passing from the camera through each of the pixels in the viewplane s pixel grid and out into 4d space .",
    "using a 4d implementation of the barycentric algorithm to compute the intersections of the ray with all tetrahedra faces , we select the intersecting event nearest to the camera ( with the @xmath2 value closest to @xmath53 ) .",
    "the array of 1d lightrays that originate from the gridded viewplane results in a 2d image of the objects projected onto that viewplane .    since the objects have been lorentz transformed prior to the intersection , such that their geometry is correct for the camera frame in which the intersection occurs , the geometric components of the lighting model , the surface normal and the reflection angle , can be used to approximate the pixel shade just as with a conventional lighting model in 3d rendering .",
    "photorealistic rendering requires the addition of lighting effects such as doppler shift@xcite and the searchlight effect , which could dominate the rendered image and obscure the visualization of the object s",
    "geometry.@xcite for this reason , these effects were not implemented in this model .",
    "three models of relativistic motion are displayed in the sequential images in figure  [ fig : figteas ] .",
    "the object displayed is a flange ( angle bracket ) 2 light - seconds wide by 2 light - seconds deep by 4 light - seconds tall .",
    "its thickness is negligible ( being constructed of four 2d triangles ) .",
    "the top row shows the traditional ray - tracing technique , where the lightspeed is effectively infinite . in the middle row ,",
    "the pre - relativistic optical effects are shown , while in the bottom row , the relativistic effects are displayed .",
    "the finite lightspeed camera ( top row ) was moved ahead in time 18.675 seconds , an amount equal to the lightspeed delay from the center of the stage to the camera , so that the flanges appear to be in approximately the same positions .",
    "the scene is set upon a stage with an overhead light source , both at rest in the camera frame .",
    "two flanges approach , cross , and depart the centerline of the scene at @xmath54 .",
    "the geometric distortions of the center row are due exclusively to classical aberration .",
    "those of the third row are due to relativistic aberration .",
    "the stage s mirrored backdrop shows the reflections of the flanges from behind .",
    "note the difference in the positions of the reflections in the three rows .",
    "the top row shows the instantaneous reflections of the flanges , while the middle and bottom rows show the retarded reflections due to the lightspeed delay imposed by the added distance to be traveled by the lightray from the object to the mirror and back .",
    "the distances modeled are on the order of the size of the jovian system .",
    "@xcite    note the bottom flanges _ appear _ to cross each other before the top flanges .",
    "note also , that even with this head start , the top flanges arrive at their respective edges at the same time as the bottom flanges .",
    "the bottom flanges appear to approach faster and retreat slower than the top flanges .",
    "this is the visual evidence of the pre - relativistic optical effect known as classical aberration .",
    "the flanges approaching the centerline of the stage are obliquely approaching the camera .",
    "aberration causes the angle from the centerline to the flanges to appear smaller than the proper angle of incidence , resulting in the object appearing closer to the centerline , or ahead of the object s proper position as depicted in the top view .",
    "this is true for both the leading and the trailing edges of the flange , independently . as a result , the leading edge ,",
    "which is closer to the centerline , appears to have moved further than the trailing edge , giving the impression of a wider flange .",
    "the opposite effect occurs as the flanges move away from the centerline .",
    "the flanges appear to incrementally speed up and simultaneously contract as they move relativistically away from the camera .",
