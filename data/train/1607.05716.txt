    "in this paper we establish upper bounds on the norms of certain sums of hermitian matrices .",
    "our interest in this result is twofold .",
    "first , using standard fourier analytic techniques developed by diaconis @xcite , our bounds enable an analysis of rates of convergence for a family of random walks on various finite heisenberg groups , building on work of bump et al .",
    "second , we obtain our bound using a type of `` uncertainty principle '' that may be useful in analyzing other related problems .",
    "the _ heisenberg group _ over a ring @xmath2 is the set of @xmath3 matrices of the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 , under the usual operation of matrix multiplication . in this paper",
    "we take @xmath6 for an odd prime integer @xmath7 . letting @xmath8",
    "denote the above matrix , the resulting heisenberg group @xmath9 is generated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , since @xmath12 .",
    "this group has order @xmath13 and center @xmath14 of size @xmath7 .",
    "the stipulations that @xmath7 be odd and prime are mainly for convenience .",
    "the authors of @xcite establish the rate of convergence of random walk on @xmath9 with steps taken uniformly at random from @xmath15 .",
    "their approach is to use the standard representation - theoretic techniques of @xcite , though there are difficulties .",
    "the group @xmath9 has @xmath16 one - dimensional representations and @xmath17 irreducible representations of dimension @xmath7 . to apply the standard machinery",
    "what is needed are good bounds on the eigenvalues of the average of the images of the generators under the @xmath7-dimensional representations of @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to the study ( in @xcite ) of the matrices @xmath18 defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be the @xmath20 `` shift '' matrix which acts on the standard basis by @xmath21 and for @xmath22 , let @xmath23 be the diagonal matrix whose @xmath24th entry is @xmath25 .",
    "then for each @xmath26 the matrix @xmath27 is the average of the images of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in one of the @xmath7-dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath9 .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite present several different proofs that the norm of @xmath18 is bounded above by @xmath30 .",
    "once this is done , a straightforward analysis of the one - dimensional representations of @xmath9 reveals that those eigenvalues can be as large as @xmath31 , so the bound on @xmath18 shows that the behavior of random walk is governed by the one - dimensional representations and a mixing time of @xmath1 is established .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the first approach utilized in @xcite in two different ways .",
    "our main contribution is the analysis of simple random walks on @xmath9 with different minimal , symmetric generating sets . for @xmath32 , consider random walk on @xmath9 with steps taken uniformly from @xmath33 note that @xmath34 generates @xmath9",
    "if and only if @xmath35 . in the case that @xmath34 generates , the matrices analogous to @xmath18 that arise in the representation theory are averages of matrices that we call _ twisted circulants_. we will define these matrices shortly .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to establish the same bound @xmath36 on the eigenvalues of these averages of twisted circulants .",
    "the same reasoning then yields mixing times @xmath1 for random walk on @xmath9 with generating set @xmath34 .",
    "our approach , following @xcite , is to generalize a version of the heisenberg uncertainty principle due to donoho and stark @xcite .",
    "we discuss this further in section [ sec : remarks ] .",
    "another generalization of the main result of @xcite applies to simple random walk on higher - dimensional heisenberg groups .",
    "the _ @xmath37-dimensional heisenberg group _ consists of upper triangular @xmath38 matrices with ones on the diagonal and zeroes everywhere else except the top row and the rightmost column . with entries from @xmath0 ,",
    "this is a nilpotent group of order @xmath39 and class @xmath40 .    using a tensor product decomposition of the representations of these groups ,",
    "we show that the rate of convergence of simple random walk on these groups with a standard set of generators can be determined easily from the lower - dimensional case .",
    "the result is corollary [ cor : higher ] : with the standard generators , @xmath41 steps are necessary and sufficient for convergence of simple random walk on the @xmath37-dimensional heisenberg group over @xmath0 .",
    "this works easily because the tensor product decomposition is naturally compatible with the standard basis .",
    "probably the same rate occurs with other generating sets , though we do not carry out this analysis .",
    "we begin with the definition of the twisted circulants .",
    "we will index the rows and colums of all matrices starting at 0 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the @xmath20 matrix with @xmath42 entry @xmath43",
    "if @xmath44 and @xmath45 otherwise . thus @xmath19 enacts the shift operator on the standard basis of @xmath46 .",
    "a _ circulant _ is any non - negative power of @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath47 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a circulant then the matrix @xmath50 has the entries @xmath48 on the @xmath51th ( cyclic ) diagonal above the main : @xmath52    recall that @xmath7 is a fixed odd prime .",
    "let @xmath53 and let @xmath2 be the diagonal matrix with @xmath54 .",

    "note that the matrix @xmath18 that arose in @xcite is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "our main result ( proved in section [ s:4 ] ) is this :    [ thm : main ] if @xmath35 then the norm of @xmath61 is at most @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 then the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 commute , and the analysis is different ; we discuss this case in section [ sec : equalslopes ] .    if @xmath35 then @xmath16 steps are necessary and sufficient for random walk on @xmath9 with generating set @xmath66 to become uniform",
    ".    the next observation can be used in the same way to determine mixing times for random walks with larger sets of generators .",

    "in particular if a constant fraction of the indices can be paired in this way then the norm of @xmath74 is at most @xmath62 .",
    "the matrix @xmath74 is the average of @xmath76 matrices of norm at most @xmath77 and @xmath78 matrices of norm @xmath43 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] can be framed in the context of the following general question : given two hermitian matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 what can one say about the norm of the sum @xmath81 ?",
    "the triangle inequality yields an upper bound of @xmath82 on the largest eigenvalue of @xmath83 , and of course this bound is sometimes achieved e.g.  when the leading eigenvectors of @xmath79 and @xmath80 coincide .",
    "horn s inequalities generalize this observation but due to their generality do not address the `` typical '' situation . specifically , suppose the diagonalizing bases are  well - mixed \" with respect to each other , meaning roughly that the eigenspaces for the leading eigenvalues of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are very far from aligning .",
    "this is meant to suggest that the two eigenbases should satisfy a kind of uncertainty principle : any vector well - concentrated in the eigenbasis of @xmath79 should be spread out in the eigenbasis of @xmath80 , and vice versa .",
    "applying this to the leading eigenvector of @xmath81 gives a bound on its eigenvalue as a weighted average of the largest parts of the spectra of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "see section [ sec : up ] for precise statements ; in the context of twisted circulants , this yields theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "this is very similar to the uncertainty principle of donoho - stark @xcite . in their case",
    "the eigenspaces for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are related by the fourier transform , but this is not essential .",
    "their beautiful and simple proof of the uncertainty principle relies solely on the fact that the individual matrix entries of the fourier transform are of size @xmath84 .",
    "in fact this is exactly what we mean by `` well - mixed . ''",
    "thus our uncertainty principle , lemma [ l : up ] , is just a slight generalization of the result from @xcite .    for the particular twisted circulants we are interested in , when we computed the change of basis matrix ( see section [ sec : calc ] )",
