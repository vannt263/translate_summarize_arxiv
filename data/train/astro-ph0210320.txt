    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) , the largest detected baryonic component of clusters of galaxies , contains thermal gas characterized by temperatures in the range of @xmath3  kev and by central densities of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to the thermal plasma , observations have showed that the icm contains nonthermal elements .",
    "diffuse synchrotron emission from the icm has been observed in many clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "diffuse radio sources in clusters are often classified either as peripheral cluster radio relic sources , or central cluster radio halo sources .",
    "these radio halo and relic sources are not associated directly with individual galaxies , but appear to be produced by relativistic electrons in the intracluster space .",
    "the typical energy of the electrons that produce the radio emission depends on the observed frequency and on the intracluster magnetic field , but it is estimated to be several gev .",
    "moreover , hard x - ray emission has been detected as a nonthermal tail at energies @xmath520 kev in at least two clusters .",
    "the coma cluster was detected with both _",
    "bepposax _ @xcite and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "possible weaker excesses may have been seen in abell  2199 @xcite , abell  2319 @xcite , and abell  3667 @xcite .",
    "this radiation is often believed to be inverse compton emission , in this case produced by relativistic electrons with the energy of @xmath6  gev and lorentz factors @xmath7 .",
    "there are several possible origins for the relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "electron acceleration at shocks in the icm has been the most popular idea ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these shocks may be attributed to the interaction between jets originated from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and icm , to galactic winds , or to the accretion of intergalactic gas .",
    "since most of the observed radio sources are very large and are often found in irregular clusters , they may be attributed to shocks formed by cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the nonthermal emission from relativistic electrons accelerated around the shocks produced during a merger of clusters with equal mass .",
    "they found that the hard x - ray and radio emission is luminous only while signatures of merging events are clearly seen in the icm .",
    "for some clusters , observations suggest that electrons are actually accelerated by shocks .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that a high - temperature shocked region is associated with diffuse radio emission in abell  665 by analyzing data from the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "shock acceleration or re - acceleration seems one of the most promising candidates of the source of relativistic particles in the localized , peripheral radio relic sources .    on the other hand ,",
    "some clusters have large diffuse radio emission that does not seem to be associated with shocks .",
    "since the lifetimes of the particles which produce the radio emission in clusters are short , it is unlikely that radio emission will be found far from shocks if particles are only accelerated at shocks .",
    "since the large radio sources are generally found in merging clusters , the simplest explanation would be an acceleration mechanism associated with mergers which is not directly related to shocks or which persists in the plasma for some period after the passage of a merger shock . for abell  3667 , a diffuse radio emission is detected in the northwest of the cluster center @xcite .",
    "although this cluster has a rapidly moving substructure , the mach number is estimated to be only @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , even if there are shocks in the cluster , the efficiency of shock acceleration may be too small to produce the observed synchrotron spectrum within the standard theory of shock acceleration .",
    "moreover , although abell  2256 , which is known as a merging cluster , also has a large diffuse radio emission @xcite , the x - ray temperature map does not show shock features @xcite .",
    "the viewing angle may prevent us from observing the shock .",
    "however , even if particles are accelerated at a bow shock , the size of the radio emission ( @xmath9mpc ) seems to be too large for a cluster to cross within the lifetimes of the particles responsible for the emission .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the effect of the low mach numbers of merger - related shocks on particle acceleration at the shocks .",
    "they suggest that major mergers , which often invoked to be sites for the production of extended radio emissions , have shocks which are too weak to result in appreciable nonthermal activity .",
    "fluid turbulence in icm is another possible origin of particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that cluster mergers can generate strong turbulence in the icm @xcite .",
    "the fluid turbulence can induce mhd waves @xcite , which accelerate particles through wave - particle resonance @xcite .",
    "contrary to shock acceleration , the turbulent resonant acceleration does not require strong shocks . even if a subcluster is moving with a subsonic velocity in a host cluster , the induced turbulence may produce high energy particles and nonthermal emission . as the first step of this study , in this paper we consider particle acceleration by alfvn waves , which are easily generated by fluid turbulence and do not damp easily .",
    "the effects of other mhd waves may also be important @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the resonant acceleration in the coma cluster ; we will study the turbulence and acceleration in clusters more generally . as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : result ] , turbulent resonant acceleration is not effective when two clusters collide with a large relative velocity because the lifetime of the induced fluid turbulence is shorter than the acceleration time of the particles .",
    "thus , turbulent acceleration is most effective when two clusters approach from a relatively small initial separation because the relative velocity when they pass each other is then relatively small .",
    "moreover , this mechanism is more likely to apply to peripheral relics rather than central halos because two clusters have the largest relative velocity at the point of closest approach of the cluster centers ; this large velocity decreases the time - scale of the fluid turbulence and also makes ram - pressure stripping of the gas of the smaller cluster effective , which reduces the volume of the turbulent region .",
    "we will concentrate on models and parameters appropriate for the cases where this mechanism is likely to be most important .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] , we summarize our models . in  [ sec : result ] we give the results of our calculations and compare them with observations .",

    "[ eq : icm_g ] ] ) and the kolmogorov law ( @xmath146 ) for the fluid turbulence ( model  a ) . from now on ,",
    "we assume @xmath248 and @xmath249 for the sake of simplicity . a larger cluster forms at @xmath92 , and a smaller cluster forms at @xmath250 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "@xcite showed that in the case of equipartition of energy and eddy size between the velocity and magnetic fields on small scales , @xmath253 .",
    "we adopt that value for @xmath57 .    figure  [ fig : asi ] shows the synchrotron luminosity of merging clusters when the smaller cluster is at the distance @xmath160 from the center of the larger cluster . the outer bends in the curves ( e.g. at @xmath254  mpc for the model of @xmath255 and @xmath256 ) correspond to the radii at which the icm radius of the smaller cluster equals to its tidal radius .",
    "when @xmath255 and @xmath257 , the maximum synchrotron luminosity is @xmath258 .",
    "since the masses of the clusters are close to the maximum observed so far , the synchrotron luminosity should be the maximum of any clusters for the parameters we have assumed .",
    "this maximum luminosity is close to that obtained from observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shows that particle acceleration originating from fluid turbulence is a promising candidate for the synchrotron radio emission from clusters .",
    "the spectral index of the nonthermal emission is given by @xmath259 . since @xmath260 for @xmath146 , the spectral index for the model cluster",
    "is @xmath261 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the observed values .",
    "for instance , for 18 clusters investigated by @xcite , the average spectral index is @xmath262 at 327  mhz .",
    "one possibility is that the upper cutoff of the energy distribution of particles steepens the observed radio spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : gmax ] ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed steep spectrum may be affected by the emission from the region where fluid turbulence has almost disappeared and higher energy particles have lost their energy .",
    "although it is halo emission , @xcite showed that the spectral index of the radio halo in the coma cluster is flat at the halo center ( @xmath263 ) compared with that in the peripheral region ( @xmath264 ) . in the future , more observations of the spectral index of halo and relic radio emission will be useful to study the turbulent acceleration there .",
    "figure  [ fig : asi ] also shows the inverse compton luminosities . compared to the synchrotron luminosities , they achieve their maxima when the smaller cluster is in the outer region of the larger cluster .",
    "this is because the magnetic fields in the clusters increase with the kinetic energy of turbulence ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mageq ] ] ) , and the fraction of the inverse compton luminosity decreases as the magnetic fields increase ( eqs .  [",
    "[ eq : lsyn ] ] and  [ [ eq : lcom ] ] ) .",
    "we present the magnetic fields produced by a smaller cluster at the distance @xmath160 from the center of a larger cluster in figure  [ fig : amag ] .",
    "the absolute inverse compton luminosity ( @xmath265 ) we predict in figure  [ fig : asi ] is much smaller than the hard x - ray luminosities observed in several clusters . for the coma cluster , which is known as a merging cluster , the _ bepposax _ detected hard x - ray flux of @xmath266 ergs @xmath267 s@xmath268 in the @xmath269  kev band",
    "this corresponds to the luminosity of @xmath270 ergs s@xmath268 @xcite . for abell  2256 , which is also known as a merging cluster ,",
    "the flux of hard x - ray emission is @xmath271 ergs @xmath267 s@xmath268 in the @xmath269  kev band range @xcite and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath272 ergs s@xmath268 .",
    "this may suggest that the hard x - ray emission observed in clusters so far are not attributed to the particles accelerated by turbulence , although our turbulence model is favorable in the view of the maximum energy of electrons (  [ sec : visc ] ) . in the future",
    ", it will be useful to observe the spatial distributions of hard x - ray emission in a number of clusters with sensitive detectors . if hard x - ray emission is observed from the same region as synchrotron emission but there are no shock features such as temperature jumps in this region , it is likely that the emission is due to turbulent acceleration of electrons .",
    "the fluid turbulence could be observed directly by detectors with high spectral resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : avt ] shows the typical turbulent velocity of the turbulence , @xmath24 , induced by a smaller cluster at the distance @xmath160 from the center of a larger cluster .",
    "the maximum velocity is @xmath273 and it could marginally be detected by observing broadened x - ray emission lines with _ astro - e2 _ ; the turbulence is likely to be observed at the regions where synchrotron radio emission is observed .",
    "since it may be difficult to measure the absolute line widths , it may be better to compare the line widths in radio - emitting regions which are expected to be turbulent with those in other regions of the cluster .",
    "moreover , although the typical turbulent velocity is @xmath274 , there should be velocity components between @xmath24 and the velocity of the smaller cluster , @xmath235 .",
    "these components would be observed as broad wings of the emission lines .",
    "the spatial scale of the turbulent nonthermal emission region ( @xmath275 ) when the smaller cluster is at a radius @xmath160 is shown in figure  [ fig : ascale ] .",
    "one concern is whether our assumption of steady turbulence and particle acceleration can be justified or not .",
    "figure  [ fig : atturb ] shows the life span of the turbulence , @xmath276 .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath277  yr for the outer regions of clusters . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that the energy distribution of accelerated electrons reaches the steady solution of @xmath278 in the time - scale of @xmath279 $ ] (  [ sec : turb ] ) .",
    "since the emission cooling time - scale , @xmath280 , does not depend on an electron energy spectrum , the relation @xmath281 is a sufficient condition for the assumption of steady - state .",
    "figure  2 in @xcite showed that the electrons with @xmath282 have the maximum lifetime of several of @xmath283  yr , and that electrons with @xmath284 have the emission cooling times shorter than @xmath283  yr .",
    "thus , we think that the assumption of steady - state is justified for electrons with @xmath285 in the outer region of a cluster .",
    "thus , if the radio and hard x - ray nonthermal emission from clusters is due to the electrons accelerated by turbulence up to @xmath286 , there must be a pool of source electrons with @xmath287 to be accelerated by turbulence in clusters .",
    "these source electrons may be provided by the shock acceleration due to cluster mergers and/or gas accretion onto clusters that occurred @xmath288  yrs ago .",
    "in particular , the merger shock wave expected to form in front of the merging smaller cluster may provide those electrons .",
    "alternatively , these electrons might come from agns in clusters , or might be secondary electrons produced by the interactions of cosmic - ray ions @xcite .",
    "as the smaller cluster reaches the center of the larger cluster , @xmath289 decreases rapidly . in this region , since the fluid turbulence has not developed fully to accelerate electrons with an energy of @xmath1 , the actual nonthermal luminosities of clusters may be smaller than those in figures  [ fig : asi ] even if there is a pool of electrons with the energy of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , although electrons with higher energy ( say @xmath290 ) can be accelerated by turbulence because of small @xmath280 , the turbulent acceleration is not a main contributor to the observed nonthermal emission .",
    "note that all the gas contained in the smaller cluster was stripped before the smaller cluster reached the center of the larger cluster in our model .",
    "thus , there is no nonthermal emission from the central region of the larger cluster ( figure  [ fig : asi ] ) .",
    "this and the small time - scale of the fluid turbulence in the central region suggest that our model favors peripheral radio relics rather than central radio halos .",
    "however , the ram - pressure stripping will depend on the central structure of the smaller cluster , although the detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "if the smaller cluster has a distinct small scale potential at the center as suggested by the observation of fornax cluster @xcite , the gas in it may not be removed easily .",
    "also , if the stars of the central galaxy in the small cluster can supply enough gas , the gas may survive the ram pressure from the icm of the larger cluster .",
    "moreover , the radiative cooling of the gas in the central region of the smaller cluster may affects the ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cluster 1e  0657@xmath29156 has a rapidly moving small component that appears to have passed the cluster center without losing all of the gas @xcite .",
    "since there are several uncertain parameters in our model , we investigate the dependence of the nonthermal emission from merging clusters on these uncertain parameters .    figure  [ fig : bsi ] shows the nonthermal emission when @xmath292 and  0.5 .",
    "the luminosities are small when @xmath293 is small .",
    "in particular , the synchrotron luminosity varies more than the inverse compton luminosity .",
    "this is because the synchrotron luminosity is affected not only by the energy injection from fluid turbulence but also by magnetic fields .",
    "when @xmath293 or @xmath24 are small , the induced magnetic fields ( eq .  [ [ eq : mageq ] ] ) is also small .",
    "if @xmath294 , most of the nonthermal emission should be the inverse compton emission rather than synchrotron emission ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : lsyn ] ] and  [ [ eq : lcom ] ] ) . on the other hand , the results do not much depend on @xmath295 .",
    "the magnetic fields shown in figure  [ fig : amag ] are roughly consistent with the large values implied by faraday rotation measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the magnetic fields must be much smaller than the values implied by the faraday rotation measurements if both nonthermal radio and hard x - ray emission are attributed to the same electron population with a power - law energy distribution without an upper cutoff @xcite .",
    "thus , we also consider the case where the magnetic fields are small .",
    "figure  [ fig : csi ] shows the nonthermal emission when @xmath296 . in this case , @xmath41 is about 30 times smaller than that in figure  [ fig : amag ] . although the synchrotron luminosity is not much different from that in figure  [ fig : asi ] , the inverse compton luminosity is much larger .",
    "this is because the total nonthermal luminosity becomes larger ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : pa ] ] and  [ [ eq : lt ] ] ) and the fraction of compton luminosity also becomes larger ( eq .  [ [ eq : lcom ] ] ) .",
    "since the maximum inverse compton luminosity is relatively large ( @xmath297 ) , the observations of both nonthermal radio and hard x - ray emission may be explained by this turbulence resonant acceleration model .",
    "if these small magnetic fields are correct , then the turbulent region must be different from the region where the faraday rotation is measured .",
    "in  [ sec : gen ] , we assumed that the fluid turbulence follows the kolmogorov law ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "however , for fully developed mhd turbulence , @xcite and  @xcite suggested that the spectral index should be @xmath298 , although this is controversial @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if turbulence has not had time to establish a kolmogorov cascade , the index may be @xmath299 .",
    "thus , we discuss the @xmath17-dependence of the nonthermal emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : dsi ] , we present the nonthermal emission when @xmath300 and  1.75 .",
    "it shows that the emission is very sensitive to @xmath17 . when @xmath300 , the inverse compton emission reaches @xmath301 , which is consistent with the observed hard x - ray luminosities @xcite even though the magnetic field is strong ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "( note that if we take @xmath303 , the inverse compton luminosity is much larger than the observed luminosities . ) on the other hand , the synchrotron luminosity exceeds the observed values of @xmath304 .",
    "however , if the maximum energy of electrons is set by fluid viscosity at @xmath305 ( eq .  [ [ eq : gmax ] ] ) , the observed synchrotron luminosity at @xmath8  ghz may be smaller than that shown in figure  [ fig : dsi ] while the inverse compton luminosity is almost the same @xcite .",
    "thus , the model with @xmath306 can explain both the nonthermal radio and inverse compton emission as a result of particle acceleration by turbulence .",
    "although the possibility is small @xcite , a smaller cluster may fall from the turnaround radius of a larger cluster ( @xmath307 ) . in this case",
    ", the smaller cluster has a large velocity near the center of the larger cluster compared to the case in  [ sec : gen ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : esi ] shows the nonthermal emission from the merging clusters . after the smaller cluster enters the virial radius of the larger cluster , it produces nonthermal emission .",
    "the maximum luminosities are not much different from those in figure  [ fig : asi ] .",
    "although the smaller cluster has a larger velocity , the radius is smaller owing to the larger ram - pressure .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : etturb ] , the time - scale of the fluid turbulence is small ( @xmath308  yr ) .",
    "this means that the turbulence can not accelerate electrons at @xmath1 up to @xmath290 , where the observed nonthermal emission is produced .",
    "thus , the actual luminosities may even smaller than those shown in figure  [ fig : esi ] . on the other hand , since the turbulent velocity is large ( @xmath309 ; figure  [ fig : evt ] ) , it would be easily observable by high spectral resolution x - ray detectors ( e.g. , _ astro - e2 _ ) .      if the gas distribution of the small cluster has been flattened and the central gas density had been decreased by non - gravitational heating before cluster formation ( preheating ) , the gas is more easily removed by the ram - pressure when the smaller cluster plunges into the larger cluster",
    "figure  [ fig : esi ] shows how the nonthermal emission from merging clusters is affected by preheating .",
    "compared with the case of no preheating ( figure  [ fig : asi ] ) , the maximum luminosities of the nonthermal emission is small especially when the mass of the smaller cluster is small .",
    "this is because preheating affects less massive clusters significantly and the gas is stripped earlier especially when the virial temperature of the smaller of the merging clusters approaches @xmath186 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : tt ] ] and  [ [ eq : icm_h ] ] ) .",
    "radio observations have shown that the luminosity of diffuse radio emission from clusters is a steep function of cluster x - ray temperature or luminosity @xcite . since the sample of radio emission is small and less luminous radio clusters",
    "may not have been observed , this correlation may actually show that the maximum radio luminosity for a given x - ray temperature or luminosity is a steep function of cluster x - ray temperature or luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the steep correlation may apply only to clusters undergoing a major merger ( small @xmath310 ) .",
    "since the preheating reduces the nonthermal emission from less massive clusters , it may help to explain the observed steep correlation .",
    "we assume that @xmath311 and it does not depend on @xmath211 . for the no preheating model ( figure  [ fig : asi ] )",
    ", the synchrotron luminosity from merging clusters of @xmath312 and @xmath313 is about 50 times smaller than that from merging clusters of @xmath255 and @xmath256 . if the temperature of the larger clusters are represented by @xmath314 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ratio of the temperature between the two cases is 4.6 .",
    "thus , the synchrotron luminosity from merging clusters roughly follows @xmath315 .",
    "similarly , for the preheating model ( figure  [ fig : esi ] ) we obtain @xmath316 .",
    "since the virial temperature of the smaller cluster of @xmath317 is @xmath318 , its merger with the larger cluster is significantly affected by the preheating . however , although preheating steepens the relation , the power - law index is still smaller than that observed ( @xmath319 ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulation done by @xcite showed that the fluid turbulence in icm is also developed after a smaller cluster passes the center of a larger cluster .",
    "this turbulence is pumped by dark matter - driven oscillations in the gravitational potential ; the merger - induced large scale bulk flows breakdown into turbulent gas motions . in this case",
    ", we expect the turbulence prevails on a cluster scale , and we can roughly estimate the nonthermal emission from the cluster . if we assume that @xmath320 , @xmath321  mpc , @xmath322 , @xmath323  k , @xmath252 , and @xmath146 , we obtain @xmath324 and @xmath325 using the model in ",

    "however , for the same parameters but with weak magnetic fields ( @xmath296 ) , we obtain @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "the luminosities are comparable to the observations . observed central radio halos may be this kind of nonthermal emission from the whole cluster",
