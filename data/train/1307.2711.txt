    ", we calculate the transmission of em waves through various one - dimensional ( 1d ) gratings and show that observed resonant frequency behavior of the transmission can be explained as an interaction of incident wave with excited plasmonic resonances .",
    "we distinguish two kinds of plasmons @xcite .",
    "the first one , lengthwise ( lw ) plasmon , which propagates along the grating surface and can be excited only when bragg s relation between the wave vector of surface plasmon and grating period is fulfilled @xcite .",
    "these lw plasmons are also responsible for the extraordinary transmission through a single aperture , if the incident surface is periodically corrugated @xcite .",
    "lw plasmon resonance appears as a sharp fano - type peak in the spectrum .",
    "the second one , crosswise ( cw ) plasmon , is excited inside the gaps @xcite .",
    "cw plasmon resonance appears as a broad fabry - perot type maximum in the spectrum .",
    "we provide quantitative estimation of resonant frequencies for both plasmons and show that they are in good agreement with rigorously calculated transmission resonances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ] the transmittance of the em wave through a metallic grating , calculated with the use of the rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa ) @xcite , is presented . in order to reveal the effect of grating geometry ( grating thickness , grating period , width of gap ) , transmittance is calculated for different grating parameters .",
    "in section [ section3 ] , observed resonances in the transmission spectra are interpreted as a coupling effect of incident em wave with the surface plasmons excited on the surface of the structure or inside it .",

    "there are two types of enhanced transmission .",
