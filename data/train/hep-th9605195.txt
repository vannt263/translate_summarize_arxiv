    "the realization of the fact that strong primordial magnetic fields should be considered on equal footing with the strong curvature in the early universe may lead to some new effects in different cosmological applications . for example , the combined effect of the gravitational field and electromagnetic field can produce a significant increase in the number of created particles in the early universe @xcite . hence , there appears the motivation to study different field theories in the combination of external gravitational and electromagnetic fields .    in the present letter",
    "we investigate the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in curved spacetime with magnetic field .",
    "such a model has been often considered in particle physics , as a reliable scenario for studying such basic phenomena as chiral symmetry breaking and the formation of composite bound states .",

    "the possibility of curvature induced chiral phase transitions may be realized there . from another side ,",
    "the magnetic field usually supports the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , it is interesting to study the behaviour of the chiral symmetry under the action of combined magnetic and gravitational field .",
    "note that such a study may be relevant to particle physics due to the fact that the standard model may be reformulated as ( gauged ) njl model .",
    "we start in section 2 from the description of the njl model in curved spacetime , and we calculate the effective potential for composite fields in 1/n expansion and in linear curvature aproximation . working in proper - time cut - off regularization , the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking induced by curvature is carefully discussed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the situation when the external magnetic field is also present .",
    "the effective potential is again evaluated , the corresponding gap equation is obtained and the chiral symmetry breaking under the action of external gravitational and magnetic fields is numerically investigated for some values of the coupling constant . in section 4",
    "we show how to find the effective potential for the njl model in curved spacetime with covariantly constant external gauge field .",
    "let us start from the action for the nambu - jona - lasinio model in curved space - time :    @xmath2 where the spinor @xmath3 has n components and @xmath4 are the curved spacetime dirac matrices .",
    "the standard way to study this model is to work in the scheme of the 1/n expansion .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the leading order in the 1/n expansion . introducing the auxiliary fields @xmath5 [ band",
    "@xmath6 one can rewrite the action ( 1 ) in the equivalent form    @xmath7 it is known that even in flat space the global abelian chiral symmetry of above model is broken spontaneously when the coupling constant is supercritical one . in curved spacetime the situation is getting more rich @xcite .",
    "there appears the possibility of curvature induced phase transitions between symmetric and non symmetric phases . in other words , symmetry may be broken even below the critical coupling constant ( depending on the curvature ) .    in this section",
    "we will discuss the symmetry breaking in the njl model working in the linear curvature aproximation ( for a general review of the effective action in linear curvature aproximation , see @xcite ) .",

    "particulary , for some fixed @xmath31 one can find the possibility of curvature induced first order phase transition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "1 we have plotted the effective potential @xmath32 for different values of r ( given in units of @xmath33 and for the coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the solution of the gap equation ( 11 ) gives us the vacuum expectation value of the composite field @xmath35 and is equal to the dynamical mass of the fermion . in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted the dynamical mass of the fermion field as a function of the curvature @xmath36 for fixed @xmath37 .",
    "let us discuss now the situation when the njl model is considered under the action of external gravitational and magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field may be treated exactly in the proper - time method [ 6 ] ( for a review of the proper - time method in external electromagnetic fields see [ 7 ] ) .",
    "it is quite known that the magnetic field increases strongly the possibility of the dynamical symmetry breaking ( see , for example [ 8 ] ) , if compared with the situation without it .",
    "the external gravitational field will be taken into account in linear curvature aproximation discussed in the previous section ( this aproximation is perfectly enough to take into account the gravitational effects even in gut epoch ) . moreover , in linear curvature aproximation we discuss only curvature terms which explicitly do not depend on the less important linear curvature - magnetic contributions .",

    "in addition , in the linear curvature terms the effect of the magnetic field is not taken into account ( it will be shown in another place that such terms are not relevant compared with the terms written in ( 13 ) ) .    making the calculation of the integrals in eq . ( 13 ) up to @xmath43 , and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath12 one gets the gap equation    @xmath44 as follows    @xmath45 @xmath46 using this gap equation one can study the dynamical symmetry breaking in different cases . in some cases",
    "it can be given analytically , for example , for values of the coupling constant @xmath31 much below the critical value , i.e. ,    @xmath47 one can find ( supposing that the second term in the r.h.s",

    "\\eqno{(19)}\\ ] ] one can see that positive curvature tends to make the first term in ( 17 ) less , i.e. it acts against the dynamical symmetry breaking . at the same time , the negative curvature always favors the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in accordance with the explicit calculations in external gravitational field [ 4 ] and with general considerations of ref . [ 9 ]",
    ".    one can give the behaviour of the effective potential as a function of curvature and magnetic field for fixed four - fermion coupling constant .",

    "5 we have plotted the solution of the gap equation ( 15 ) as a function of @xmath36 for two different values of the coupling @xmath31 with the same magnetic field .",
    "in this section we will discuss the njl model within covariantly constant gauge field and in a weekly curved spacetime .",

    "the same cut - off regularization is applied .",
    "the imaginary part of the effective potential describes the particle creation ( for a review , see [ 7 ] ) .    using the real part of the above effective potential one",
    "again can study numerically the dynamical symmetry breaking under the action of covariantly constant gauge field and weak gravitational field .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the effective potential in chromomagnetic field taking into account the curvature effects is similar to the behaviour in the previous section .",
    "we do not discuss this model in detail because the vacuum is not stable due to the presence of the imaginary part in an effective potential .    in summary",
    ", in this paper we studied the njl model in curved spacetime with magnetic field .",
    "working in linear curvature expansion and in the proper - time cut - off , the effective potential for the composite field @xmath35 has been calculated .",
    "the phase structure of the theory has been studied numerically first for the case without magnetic field . in a situation , when the magnetic field is not zero the phase structure has been studied under the combined action of magnetic field ( which gives stronger effect to dynamical symmetry breaking ) and of gravitational field . finally , we have shown how one can extend the results of the present study to the background of curved spacetime with covariantly constant gauge fields .",
    "the approach described in this paper may be extended to the situation when both gravitational and magnetic fields are treated exactly ( with some technical details being more complicated ) , or to other background on gauge fields ( say , external electromagnetic field ) .",
    "the results of the above study maybe useful for cosmological applications ( in particulary , the early universe ) in inflationary models based on the composite fields potential of sort ( 10 ) , ( 13 ) . note also that it would be of interest to discuss more realistic gauged njl model in a similar way . + * acknowledgments + sdo would like to thank yu .",
