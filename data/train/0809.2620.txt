    "the emission processes responsible for the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of large - scale quasar jets , constructed using _ spitzer _ , _ hst _ and _ chandra _ data , are the subject of active debate @xcite .",

    "inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of cmb photons by high - energy electrons ( with electron lorentz factor of @xmath1 ) in a highly relativistic jet with bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 initially seemed an attractive way to explain the observed x - ray emission @xcite , but this process is also not free of problems @xcite .",
    "finally , the x - rays may arise from synchrotron radiation from extremely energetic protons @xcite .",
    "determining which of these emission mechanisms produces the observed x - ray jets in powerful quasars is a strong motivation for more observations of radio - loud quasars , and has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of known x - ray jets .    in this work ,",

    "we compare seds of the large - scale jets in 3c  273 and pks  1136@xmath0135 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pks1136sed ] .",
    "the two seds share common features .",
    "the optical and uv fluxes of the jet have a clear excess over the extrapolation from the infrared wavelengths , indicating that two spectral components cross over at optical wavelengths .",
    "we identify two spectral components as follows : ( 1 ) the low - energy ( le ) synchrotron spectrum extending from radio to infrared with a spectral cutoff at @xmath7 hz , and ( 2 ) the high - energy ( he ) component arising in the optical and smoothly connecting to the x - ray flux .",
    "the two - component nature of the jet sed becomes more apparent if we construct knot - by - knot seds ( see refs .  ) .",
    "each sed shows the two components with varying relative strengths such that the low - energy part becomes more dominant with increasing distance from the quasar core .",
    "the position of the spectral cutoff of the le component seems similar from one knot to another .",
    "interestingly , in 3c  273 , the spectral slopes of the he component change from @xmath8 ( inner knots ) to @xmath9 ( outer knots ) .",
    "let us deduce some physical parameters of the le spectral component , which is synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons in the jet . the observed jet radiation is enhanced by doppler beaming .",
    "( the doppler factor is defined as @xmath10^{-1}$ ] with @xmath11 the velocity of the jet , @xmath12 the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , and @xmath13 the observing angle with respect to the jet direction . )    the le synchrotron emission has a high - energy cutoff at @xmath14 hz , presumably associated with the maximum energy of the electron population .",
    "the maximum energy can be deduced as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the comoving magnetic field strength .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field is @xmath17 mg for 3c  273 and @xmath18 mg for pks  1136@xmath0135 .    by extrapolating vla radio flux of knot",
    "h1/h2 in 3c  273 to lower frequencies ( 10100 mhz ) , we found that a low energy  cutoff \" or ",
    "break \" should be present as well .",
    "otherwise , the jet radio flux around @xmath19 mhz exceeds even the total radio flux of 3c  273",
    ". it would be reasonable to assume that such a cutoff / break is common to all the knots .",
    "we adopt @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c273sed ] to introduce the low energy cutoff . also , the observed synchrotron spectra from the radio to optical frequencies are likely to be formed in a  cooling regime \" , and therefore a cooling break may appear in low - frequency radio bands .    using the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is acceleration index ,",
    "the observed index of @xmath23 is translated into the electron acceleration index of @xmath24 , close to the hardest possible index ( @xmath25 ) in the nonlinear shock acceleration theory .",
    "here we assumed particle acceleration taking place in each knot , where relativistic electrons are accumulated over a certain timescale of @xmath26 to @xmath27 yr . assuming that the number of radio - emitting electrons is balanced by the number of cold protons in the jet , we estimated a jet kinetic power of @xmath28 with @xmath29 and the equipartition magnetic field .      the beamed ic scenario @xcite was initially considered to be an attractive explanation of the x - ray - dominated component of the sed for jet knots in radio - loud quasars , like 3c  273 ( ref .  ) and pks  1136@xmath0135 ( refs .  ) .",
    "we argued for a direct connection between the optical and x - ray fluxes @xcite . the same mechanism should be responsible for the optical and x - ray emissions . if one adopts the beamed ic model for the x - rays , the energy distribution of electrons has to continue down to very low energies of @xmath30 to account for the optical emission .    in the framework of the beamed ic radiation , it is interesting to note that the jet exhibits the evolution of multiwavelength emission along the jet as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3c273image ] .",
    "the increase of radio brightness is accompanied by the decrease of x - ray brightness towards downstream , which can be understood in terms of deceleration of the jet @xcite . if the beamed ic scenario is correct , we are able to study the flow structure of the large - scale jets .",
    "new results indicate , however , that the beamed ic scenario faces several difficulties .",
    "first , in the outer knots of the 3c  273 jet , the radio spectral index of @xmath31 disagrees with the he spectral index of @xmath32 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "second , the parameters required in the beamed ic / cmb model are often too extreme . in the case of 3c  273",
    ", we obtained a doppler factor of @xmath33 for knot a and a jet kinetic power of @xmath34 .",
    "the obtained doppler factor seems too large for 3c  273 , since relatively large contributions from the un - beamed components are observed in the core emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c273sed ] ) and accretion - disk emission appears to be comparable to the jet emission in the x - ray regime @xcite . in the case of pks  1136@xmath0135 , we obtained a doppler factor of @xmath35 , which is also difficult to reconcile with the lobe - dominated nature of the quasar .    instead of the beamed ic ,",
    "synchrotron radiation by a second population of high - energy electrons may account for the he component .",
    "then the spectral index of the he component , @xmath36 in 3c  273 and pks  1136@xmath0135 , corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "however , @xmath38 would be incompatible with diffusive shock acceleration theory .",
    "this brings into question the idea that the second electron population is accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the second synchrotron component may instead be due to turbulent acceleration operating in the shear layers @xcite . unlike the shock acceleration , a hard spectrum , @xmath39 ,",
    "can be expected to form in the case of turbulent acceleration ( i.e. , second - order fermi acceleration ) .",
    "this scenario should be tested by future tev observations ( see below ) .      as detailed in ref .",
    ", glast measurements of the quasar jets will provide us with new information ( or constraints ) about the jet emission .",
    "the infrared - emitting electrons in a relativistic jet inevitably emit gev @xmath40-rays through an ic / cmb process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c273sed ] ) .",
    "the total radiative output is dominated by the multi - gev @xmath40-rays and their predicted flux with @xmath41 exceeds the 1-yr sensitivity offered by the glast lat in the case of 3c 273 .",
    "also , the observations of pks  1136@xmath0135 with glast may be able to test the ic / cmb hypothesis , since the beamed ic model with @xmath42 predicts the observable gev flux @xcite .",
    "note that steadiness and hard spectrum can distinguish the large - scale emission from the core emission .",
    "moreover , if the he fluxes are due to synchrotron radiation by electrons , the uv / x - ray - emitting electrons in a relativistic jet produce ic - upscattered tev @xmath40-rays .",
    "this offers a potential diagnostic tool to distinguish the origin of the he component .",
    "finally we emphasize that optical polarimetry can be an effective way of discriminating the radiation models responsible for the optical - to - x - ray emission of the jets . in the beamed ic interpretation ,",
    "the optical and x - ray emission are due to compton up - scattering off the amplified cmb by high - energy electrons of @xmath43 ( optical ) and @xmath44 ( x - ray ) . unlike in the case of synchrotron models ,",
    "the x - rays are expected to be _",
    "unpolarized _ and the optical light is nearly unpolarized at most a few percent of polarization ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pol ] ) .",
    "precise polarization measurements in the optical can in principle verify ( or discard ) the beamed ic model .",
    "unfortunately , there have been no useful polarization observations of quasar jets with _",
    "hst _ so far . only for 3c 273 ,",
    "early _ hst _ polarimetry of the jet was done but with the pre - costar foc and low significances @xcite . recently , _ hst _",
    "polarimetry of pks  1136@xmath0135 has been approved ( pi : eric perlman ) .",
    "new polarimetry of quasar jets on large - scales will provide important clues as to the origin of the he component .",
