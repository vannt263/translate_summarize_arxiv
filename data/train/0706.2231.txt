    "@xmath6 lepton hadronic decays provide a laboratory for the study of low energy hadronic currents under very clean conditions . in these decays ,",
    "the hadronic system is produced from the qcd vacuum via the charged weak current mediated by a @xmath9 boson .",

    "the decay @xmath13 ( unless specified otherwise , charge conjugate decays are implied throughout the paper ) has the largest branching fraction of all cabibbo - suppressed decays of the @xmath6 lepton .",
