    "typical wavelength of gravitational waves from astrophysical compact objects such as bh(black hole)-bh binaries is in some cases very long so that wave optics must be used instead of geometrical optics when we discuss gravitational lensing .",
    "more precisely , if the wavelength becomes comparable or longer than the schwarzschild radius of the lens object , the diffraction effect becomes important and as a result the magnification factor approaches unity @xcite .",
    "mainly due to the possibility that the wave effects could be observed by future gravitational wave observations , several authors @xcite have studied wave effects in gravitational lensing in recent years .    in most of the works which studied gravitational lensing phenomenon in the framework of wave optics , isolated and",

    "cosmic strings generically arise as solitons in a grand unified theory and could be produced in the early universe as a result of symmetry breaking phase transition@xcite . if symmetry breaking occurred after inflation , the strings might survive until the present universe . recently , cosmic strings attract a renewed interest partly because a variant of their formation mechanism was proposed in the context of the brane inflation scenario@xcite . in this scenario inflation",
    "is driven by the attractive force between parallel d - branes and parallel anti d - branes in a higher dimensional spacetime . when those brane - anti - brane pairs collide and annihilate at the end of inflation , lower - dimensional d - branes , which behave like monopoles , cosmic strings or domain walls from the view point of four - dimensional observers , are formed generically @xcite .",
    "for some time , cosmic string was a candidate for the seed of structure formation of our universe , but this possibility was ruled out by the measurements of the spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies@xcite .",
    "the current upper bound on the dimensionless string tension @xmath4 is around @xmath5 , which comes from the observations of cmb@xcite and/or the pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "although cosmic string can not occupy dominant fraction of the energy density of the universe , its non - negligible population is still allowed observationally@xcite .",
    "in fact , sazhin et al.@xcite reported that csl-1 , which is a double image of elliptical galaxies with angular separation @xmath6 , could be the first case of the gravitational lensing by a cosmic string with @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite , wave propagation around a cosmic string was studied but they put the waveform around the string by hand . compared with that corresponding to the geometrical optics .",
    "we show that the importance of the diffraction effects are determined by the combination of three parameters , @xmath4 , the distance from the string to the observer and the wavelength and that the relative amplitude of the diffracted wave can be @xmath8 for realistic astrophysical situations . ]",

    "ii in detail . in section iv ,",
    "we focus on compact binaries as the sources of gravitational waves and discuss the possible effects due to finiteness of the lifetime and the frequency evolution of the binaries on the detection of the gravitational waves which pass near a cosmic string .",
    "we also give a rough estimate for the event rate of the lensing of gravitational waves from ns - ns mergers assuming decigo / bbo .",

    "a solution of einstein equations around an infinite straight cosmic string to first order in @xmath9 is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a cylindrical coordinate(@xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the deficit angle around the cosmic string",
    ". spatial part of the above metric describes the euclidean space with a wedge of angular size @xmath14 removed .",
    "due to the deficit angle around a string , double images of the source are observed with an angular separation @xmath15 when a source is located behind the string in the limit of geometrical optics . in general for a wave with a finite wavelength , some interference pattern appears .",
    "an exact solution of einstein equations around a finite thickness string has been already obtained @xcite , but we use the metric ( [ 1.1 ] ) as a background since the string thickness is negligibly small compared with the einstein radius , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance from the observer to the string .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we consider waves of a massless scalar field instead of gravitational waves for simplicity , but the wave equations are essentially the same in these two cases .",
    "an extension to the cosmological setup is straightforwardly done by adding an overall scale factor . in that case",
    "the time coordinate @xmath18 is to be understood as the conformal time .",
    "the wave equation remains unchanged if we consider a conformally coupled field , but it is modified for the other cases due to curvature scattering .",
    "the correction due to curvature scattering of the friedmann universe is suppressed by the square of the ratio between the wavelength and the hubble length , which can be neglected in any situations of our interest .",
    "our goal of this section is to construct a solution of the wave equation which corresponds to a plane wave injected perpendicularly to and scattered by the cosmic string .",
    "this situation occurs if the distance between the source and the string is infinitely large . in order to construct such a solution",
    ", we introduce a monochromatic source uniformly extended in the @xmath19-direction and localized in @xmath20 plane , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency and we have introduced @xmath23 , a constant independent of @xmath24 , to adjust the overall normalization when we later take the limit @xmath25 .",

    "in particular it is not manifest whether the amplification of the solution in the short wavelength limit coincides with the one which is obtained by the geometrical optics approximation",
    ". therefore it will be quite useful if one can derive a simpler analytic expression .",
    "here we reduce the formula by assuming that the distance between the string and the observer is much larger than the wave length , @xmath52 which is valid in almost all interesting cases .    using an integral representation of the bessel function , @xmath53 where the contour of the integral @xmath54 is such as shown in fig .",

    "in this section , we consider compact binaries as sources of gravitational waves . gravitational waves from compact binaries are clean in the sense that the waves are almost monochromatic : the time scale for the frequency to change is much longer than the orbital period of the binary except for the phase just before plunge . hence interference between two waves coming from both sides of the cosmic string could be observed by future detectors .",

    ", we estimate the detection rate of the gravitational lensing caused by cosmic strings for planned gravitational wave detectors such as lisa , decigo and bbo .",
    "it is well known that string network obeys the scaling solution where the appearance of the string network at any time looks alike if it is scaled by the horizon size .",
    "there are a few dozen strings spread crossing the horizon volume and a number of string loops  @xcite .",
    "since the horizon scale increases in the comoving coordinates as time goes , the number of strings increase if there is no interaction between them . however , since strings are typically moving at a relativistic speed , they frequently intersect with each other . as a result reconnection between strings occurs , reducing the number of long strings which extend over the horizon scale . during the process of reduction of the number of long strings a large number of string loops are formed , but they shrink and decay via gravitational radiation . due to the balance of two effects , the number of long strings in a horizon volume remains almost constant in time .",
    "the reconnection probability @xmath270 is essentially @xmath271 for gauge theory solitons  @xcite because reconnection allows the flux inside the string to take an energetically favorable shortcut . for f - strings ,",
    "the reconnection is a quantum process and its probability is roughly estimated as @xmath272 , where @xmath273 is the string coupling and is predicted in @xcite that @xmath274 for d - strings , the reconnection probability might be @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "if the reconnection probability is less than @xmath271 , the number of long strings is expected to be @xmath276 times larger than that in the case with @xmath277 .",
    "therefore it is expected that in the context of cosmic strings motivated by superstring theory the number of long strings in a horizon volume can be @xmath278 or more .    to estimate the event rate for the gravitational lensing , here we consider a compact binary ( such as binary neutron stars and/or black holes ) as a source of gravitational waves .",
    "there are large uncertainties about the event rate of mbh ( massive black hole ) merger detected by lisa or decigo / bbo .",
    "several authors @xcite employed a model in which mbh mergers are associated with the mergers of host dark matter halos to estimate the event rate of mbh - mbh mergers . in this model , the event rate is dominated by halos with the minimum mass @xmath279 above which halos have a central mbh and some scenario predict that the event rate could reach @xmath280 events / yr . for decigo / bbo , the binary neuron stars will be observed @xmath281 events / yr .    the probability of lensing for a single source by an infinite straight cosmic string both at cosmological distances is @xmath282 eq .  ( [ es3 ] ) is derived under the geometrical optics approximation . in section iii , we found that the signal of lensing by cosmic strings ( the interference pattern of gravitational waves at detectors ) extends over an angular scales larger than the deficit angle @xmath283 when the diffraction effect is marginally important .",
    "this is a well known fact for the gravitational lensing by usual stellar objects @xcite . as we estimated in section iii",
    ", the critical distance @xmath284 below which the diffraction effect becomes important is @xmath285 therefore the probability of lensing by cosmic strings may be enhanced due to the diffraction effect for @xmath286 at lisa band ( @xmath287sec ) and for @xmath288 at decigo / bbo band ( @xmath289sec ) .",
    "assuming the prospective values of the parameters that determines the rate of lensing events @xmath290 , we obtain @xmath291 where @xmath292(@xmath293 ) denotes the numerical factor arising from the enhancement of the lensing probability due to the diffraction effect .",
    "@xmath294 is almost upper bound on the total event rate of neutron star mergers detectable by decigo / bbo .",
    "if the event rate is even higher , the number of events becomes comparable to or larger than the number of frequency bins .",
    "then we will not be able to distinguish each event , and undistinguishable signals become confusion noise . in the case of lisa ,",
    "this bound on @xmath295 is even lower .",
    "unfortunately , a large number of lensing events by cosmic strings can be expected only for marginally large @xmath296 with a small reconnection probability @xmath270 .",
    "finally we briefly comment on the validity of the assumption that most of cosmic strings can be treated as straight ones in studying gravitational lensing by them . in geometrical optics approximation ,",
    "only light paths which satisfy the fermat s principle contribute to the amplification factor .",
    "if we take into account the finiteness of the wavelength , the trajectories whose optical path differences are less than a few times of its wavelength will dominantly contribute to the amplification factor . in terms of the distance on the lens plane ( @xmath208-plane in fig .",
    "[ configuration ] ) , the optical paths within @xmath297 from the intersection of the geodesic will give a dominant part of the amplification factor .",
    "in the standard literature , the typical size of small - scale structure of a long string is given by the gravitational back - reaction scale @xmath298 , where @xmath18 is a cosmic time @xcite .",
    "but this is not an established argument and some recent studies suggest that the smallest size of the wiggles could be much smaller than @xmath299 @xcite . if we assume here that the smallest size of the wiggles is @xmath299 , then the condition that the straight string approximation is good is @xmath300 . substituting the appropriate values of the parameters",
    ", it gives the condition , @xmath301 hence approximating a cosmic string by a straight one is good for wide range of possible values of the parameters .",

    "even when the image in the geometrical optics is not directly seen by the observer , the interference patterns remain .",
    "in contrast , in the geometrical optics magnification and interference occur only when the observer can see two images which travel both sides of the string .",
    "namely , the angular range where lensing signals exist is broadened by the diffraction effect .",

    "<S> we present exact solutions of the massless klein - gordon equation in a spacetime in which an infinite straight cosmic string resides . </S>",
    "<S> the first solution represents a plane wave entering perpendicular to the string direction . </S>",
    "<S> we also present and analyze a solution with a static point - like source . in the short wavelength limit </S>",
    "<S> these solutions approach the results obtained by using the geometrical optics approximation : magnification occurs if the observer lies in front of the string within a strip of angular width @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the string tension . we find that when the distance from the observer to the string is less than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wave length , the magnification is significantly reduced compared with the estimate based on the geometrical optics due to the diffraction effect . for gravitational waves from neutron star(ns)-ns mergers the several lensing events per year may be detected by decigo / bbo . </S>"
