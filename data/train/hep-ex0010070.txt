    "in the 1960s-1980 s high quality secondary beams became available at proton synchrotrons of increasing energies ( ps , ags , ihep , fnal , sps ) .",
    "the secondary charged hadron beams contained the six stable or quasi stable charged particles @xmath0 , k@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the main experimental lines of research were : i ) total hadron ",
    "hadron ( @xmath4 ) cross section measurements at high energies ( @xmath5 gev / c ) ; ii ) elastic @xmath4 scattering measurements ; iii ) measurements of absorption cross sections of hadrons in nuclei ( as byproducts of @xmath4 total cross section measurements ) ; iv ) hadron production at forward angles in @xmath6 collisions , and v ) inelastic @xmath4 collisions [ 1 - 5 ]",
    ". in some high intensity beams many particle searches were made , which also lead to the study of @xmath7 and @xmath8 production [ 6 ] .    in order to reach higher energies it became necessary to build hadron colliders .",
    "the first was the isr @xmath9 and @xmath10 collider at cern , which allowed to reach c.m .",
    "energies between 22 and 63 gev ; then the @xmath11 collider at cern allowed @xmath10 collisions from 600 to 900 gev ; finally the fermilab tevatron collider allowed @xmath12 collisions up to 1.8 tev .",
    "the first experiments performed at the isr were relatively simple dedicated experiments , like those for total cross section and elastic scattering measurements , and single arm spectrometers for the study of inelastic collisions [ 7 - 8 ] . then followed general purpose detectors : the sfm at the isr [ 9 ] , the general purpose detectors ua1 and ua2 and experiment ua4 at the @xmath11 collider , and finally the general purpose detectors cdf , d0 and the specialized experiments e710 , f8 at fermilab [ 10 ] .",
    "the highest energies were and are still obtainable only with cosmic rays .",
    "we shall discuss total cross sections at high energies , the high energy low@xmath13 parameters and some features of inelastic collisions [ 11 , 12 ] .",
    "at fixed target accelerators ( ags , ihep , fnal ) the total cross sections were measured with the transmission method , with relative precisions smaller than @xmath14 and systematic scale errors of about @xmath15 .",
    "the measurements of the total cross sections at the @xmath9 and @xmath16 colliders required the development of new experimental techniques : the scattering of particles was measured at very small angles , with detectors positioned in reentrant containers ( roman pots \" ) located very close to the circulating beams .",
    "the combination of statistical and systematic uncertainties are @xmath17 .",
    "fig 1 summarizes the present status of high energy total cross section measurements : for @xmath18 gev all total @xmath4 cross sections decrease , reach a minimum and then increase with increasing energy ( the @xmath19 total cross section was already increasing at serpukhov energies [ 1 ] ) .",
    "moreover the differences between the cross sections @xmath20 and @xmath21 decrease with increasing energy [ 5 ] .",
    "there is not a unique interpretation for this rise , though in many qcd inspired models it seems to be connected with the increase of the number of minijets and thus to semi - hard gluon interactions .    most of the high energy elastic and total cross section data have been usually interpreted in terms of regge poles , and thus in terms of pomeron exchange .",
    "even if the pomeron was introduced long time ago we do not have a consensus on its exact definition and on its detailed substructure .",
    "some authors view it as a `` gluon ladder '' .",
    "future experiments on hadron - hadron total cross sections remain centered at the fermilab collider ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the near future will rely on the bnl - rich collider , and later , on the lhc proton - proton and heavy ion collider at cern .",
    "large area cosmic ray experiments may be able to improve the data in the ultra high energy region [ 12 ] .",
    "the differential cross section for the elastic scattering of unpolarized particles from unpolarized targets has a simple structure in the high energy region .",
    "it depends on two variables : the energy and an angular variable , which is usually chosen to be the square of the four momentum transfer @xmath22 .",
    "the energy dependence is of the @xmath23 type .",
    "the angular distribution may be divided in four regions : i ) the coulomb region for @xmath24 ( gev / c)@xmath25 ; ii ) the coulomb - nuclear interference region for @xmath26 ( gev / c)@xmath25 ; measurements in this region yield information on the ratio @xmath27 of the real to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "iii ) the nuclear diffraction region proper for @xmath28 ( gev / c)@xmath25 ; here the most important parameter is the slope b , or the slopes @xmath29 , of the diffraction pattern .",
    "iv ) the large angle region for @xmath30 ( gev / c)@xmath25 : for @xmath31 gev it is characterized by a dip - bump structure which resembles that from diffraction from an opaque disc .",
    "most of these features are observed in the @xmath9 and @xmath16 elastic scattering angular distributions at @xmath32 , 546 and 1400 gev , see fig .",
    "one usually defines the following high energy scattering parameters : i ) the total cross section , @xmath33 ; ii ) the slope @xmath34 of the differential elastic nuclear cross section @xmath35 , at @xmath36 ( gev / c)@xmath25 ; iii ) the ratio @xmath37 ; iv ) the opacity @xmath38 . at very high energies",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath34 and @xmath40 rise with energy , while @xmath27 is slightly positive . from the behaviour of these parameters emerges the picture of a proton which becomes bigger ( larger @xmath34 ) and more opaque ( larger @xmath40 ) as the energy increases . at the highest energy @xmath41 , which is still smaller than the black disk value of 1 . +",
    "3 shows pictorially various inelastic processes at low @xmath42 : single and double diffraction dissociation and inelastic processes ; these are the dominant processes with the largest cross sections , concentrated in particular in the very forward angular region : this is the region which is most important for cosmic ray experiments .    at high energies",
    "the total @xmath16 cross section may be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the elastic cross section , @xmath45 is the single diffractive cross section when the incoming proton fragments into a number of particles , @xmath46 is the single diffractive cross section for the fragmentation of the antiproton ( at high energies @xmath47 ) .",
    "@xmath48 is the double diffractive cross section , @xmath49 is the non - diffractive part of the inelastic cross section ( fig .",
    "the elastic , single diffractive and double diffractive processes give rise to low multiplicity events with particles emitted in the very forward region in the c.m .",
    "the non - diffractive cross section is the main part of the inelastic cross section ; it gives rise to high multipliciy events and to particles emitted at all angles .",
    "most of the non - diffractive cross section concerns particles emitted with low transverse momentum ( _ low @xmath50 physics _ ) with properties which change slowly with c.m .",
    "energy ( _ @xmath51 physics)_. a small part of the non - diffractive cross section is due to central collisions among the colliding particles and gives rise to high @xmath50 jets of particles emitted at relatively large angles ( _ large @xmath50 physics)_. the contribution of jet physics increases with c.m . energy .    in fig .",
    "4a are shown , vs @xmath52 , the average charged multiplicities in @xmath9 and @xmath16 collisions . the data may be fitted to a power law of @xmath23 : @xmath53 at @xmath54 tev are produced on average 40 charged and 20 neutral particles . fig .",
    "4b shows the average number of @xmath0 , @xmath55 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 produced in @xmath9 collisions up to @xmath52 @xmath56 gev .",
    "pions are the dominantly produced hadrons .",
    "hadrons are mainly produced at low transverse momenta .",
    "the average @xmath50 increases slowly with @xmath52 : it is @xmath57 gev / c in @xmath58 gev ; then it increases slowly up to @xmath59 gev / c at @xmath54 tev .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these features is in terms of thermodynamic models : hadrons are emitted from a region with a temperature @xmath60 mev .",
    "qcd , at present can not be used to calculate the data at low @xmath50 , because the strong coupling constant is large and perturbative methods can not be used .",
    "therefore one has to use models .",
    "hard collisions can instead be calculated by perturbative qcd .",
    "usually , as byproducts of @xmath4 total cross section measurements , the absorption cross sections of @xmath0 , @xmath55 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 on various nuclei ( li , c , al , cu , sn , and pb ) were measured at incident lab momenta up to 280 gev / c [ 2 , 4 , 11 ] .",
    "most absorption cross sections decrease slowly for p@xmath61 up to @xmath62 50 gev / c ; for higher p@xmath61 they are almost constant .",
    "the data at each energy were fitted to the simple expression @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the atomic weight of the target nucleus .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "5a at three lab momenta for three different incoming hadrons .",
    "for all incident particles except antiprotons , the value of @xmath65 increases by up to 10% as the incident p@xmath61 increases from 60 to 280 gev / c , with the largest increase for @xmath66 . for @xmath3",
    ", @xmath65 decreases with increasing p@xmath61 .",
    "5b shows the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath67 vs the corresponding @xmath68 total cross section : @xmath65 rises monotonically with @xmath69 ; the values of @xmath67 are consistent with @xmath67 approaching 0.67 for large values of @xmath69 as would be expected for an opaque nucleus .",
    "the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei were measured at many energies using nuclear track detectors , which yield high resolution measurements of the restricted energy loss .",
    "this arises from the relatively low energy required to break the polymeric bonds of the detectors and because fluctuations due to energetic @xmath70-electrons do not contribute to the latent track formation .",
    "the radiation damage along the path of an incoming nucleus may be developed to microscope - visible cones by chemical etching .",
    "6a shows the charge distribution obtained with 200 gev / nucleon s@xmath71 ions and their fragments produced in a cu target [ 13 ] : notice the good charge resolution and the absence of nuclei with fractional charges .",
    "the cross sections in fig .",
    "6b are relative to fragments of 158 gev / nucleon pb@xmath72 ions in a target with @xmath73 with a variation of atomic number @xmath74 with respect to the @xmath75 of the incoming ions .",
    "a wealth of experimental information has been obtained since the early 1960 s on high - energy hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus cross sections , starting with simple equipments and proceeding to more complex apparata and better beams .",
    "the higher energy data coming from collider experiments have large systematic uncertainties , mainly connected to the poor knowledge of the collider luminosity , the difficulty of measuring with some precision the single and double diffraction cross sections , etc .",
    "most of the information on hadron - hadron collisions was interpreted in terms of phenomenological models .",
    "much more work is needed to interpret and systemize the available data , since only the small part of the cross section corresponding to large transverse momenta may be interpreted in terms of qcd .",
    "few and not too precise data are available at very low @xmath42 and very small angles , which is the region where more interest lies for cosmic rays .",
    "the information is here codified in monte carlos , which are becoming progressively more complicated .",
    "the monte carlos include hadron - nucleus collisions [ for which the data are much less abundant than for @xmath4 collisions ] ; hadron - nucleus effects are mainly interpreted in the context of the gluber model [ 14 ] .",
    "nucleus - nucleus data are even less abundant , and the monte carlos have extra complications coming from the used models [ 14 ] .    in the near future",
    "the rich collider at bnl should provide data on nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the future the different experiments at the lhc collider should provide data on @xmath4 , hadron - nuclei and nuclei - nuclei collisions at much higher energies .",
    "we thank many colleagues for their collaboration , for many discussions and for explanations of cosmic ray monte carlos .",
    "we thank ms l. de angelis for typing the manuscript .",
