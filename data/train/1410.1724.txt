    "the probability densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wf1 ] and  [ fig : wf2 ] ) exhibit instead a partially good agreement with the course of the classical orbit .",
    "differences can be explained by the fact that the calculated wave function is only a snapshot while the resonance itself is a time evolving and finally decaying state .",
    "it can be observed that the larger values of the probability density are taken on in the @xmath53-plane when regarding the first resonance series . in case of the second resonance series",

    "as expected , the torus structure is , especially in direction of the momentum @xmath160 , much smaller than the quantum - mechanical structure .",
    "finally we want to estimate at which field strengths a solution of the classical structure may be possible .",
    "since the classical orbit is localized in the @xmath53-plane we regard the extension of the torus structure around the orbit in a @xmath74-@xmath161-poincar section as its classical uncertainity assuming that the quantum - mechanically determined uncertainity product @xmath162 for one resonance of the first series does not change to a great extent with the value of @xmath156 , since it is already sufficiently close to the critical value of @xmath163 , we obtain a coincidence not until @xmath164{mt}$ ] ! this field strength is convenient for an experimental proof of the orbits @xmath67 in photoabsorption spectra .",
    "as it has been described , one of the intersection points of the classical orbits with the @xmath55-axis is very close to the nucleus within the relevant region around @xmath69 .",
    "an exisiting overlap of the corresponding resonances and the lowest states ( 1s or 2p ) of the hydrogen atom allows therefore an experimental excitation of the hydrogen atom into those resonance states . according to closed orbit theory @xcite and periodic orbit theory @xcite",
    "the classical periodic orbits then become noticeable in photoabsorption spectra by oscillating terms of the form @xmath165 , in which the amplitudes depend on the stability of the orbits as well as the process of excitation . for the purpose of an experimental proof the data of an classical orbit located in the center of the stability island",
    "is given in scaled atomic units : @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "the conversion to unscaled units at the chosen magnetic field strength is obtained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : skal ] ) and @xmath169 .",
    "following the quasi - penning resonances up to high energies and field strengths we could resolve their complete bifurcation behavior .",
    "we found out that only @xmath73 , @xmath67 and three - dimensional orbits are involved in the bifurcations of @xmath65 .",
    "it was shown that several phenomena appear in the region of @xmath69 including a cusp bifurcation between @xmath65 and @xmath67 as well as the appearance of a stability island for @xmath67 .",
    "the reappearance of those phenomena when analysing the stability and bifurcation behavior of @xmath83 could then be interpreted as a possibility to find them on - and - off - again for orbits of even more complicated shape .",
    "the puzzle of the @xmath74-stability region of @xmath65 ending in an in parameter space could be resolved by a closer examination of the stability of @xmath67 .",
    "the results show a coincidence of two stability at @xmath79 , which indicates the continuation of the stability borders limiting the areas of stability in @xmath74-direction from one of those orbits to the other one .",
    "semiclassical quantizations of @xmath67 showed agreements with resonances found in exact quantum spectra . due to further agreements between quantum - mechanical probability densities and classical orbits as well as between quantum - poincar sections and classical torus structure we have to conclude that signatures of the stable orbit @xmath67 in exact quantum spectra have been found .",
    "owing to limited computer memory and power it is not yet possible to reach regions of several millitesla in order to find out whether the widths of the detected resonances will disappear within the stability island or not .",
    "nevertheless we think that an experimental proof of @xmath67 in photoabsorption spectra at the estimated field strengths will eventually be possible .",
    "finally , since the widths of the observed resonances do not vanish within the stability island of @xmath67 and since the stability island is very close to the bifurcation lines with @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we think that the orbits @xmath67 can not be treated as isolated ones in a semiclassical quantization",
