    "the effect of spin - orbit interactions in magnets are of considerable interest , for its rich physics in magnetism the interaction gives rise to .",
    "an important effect of the spin - orbit interaction in magnets is that the interaction lifts the orbital degeneracy , potentially realizing the pure spin systems in solid state materials free from orbital physics .",
    "a consequence of such orbital deneneracy lifting is that the spin - orbit interaction bring about anisotropic interactions that depends on the bond .",
    "while such interaction is expected to be relatively small in the @xmath2 transition metal oxides , the interaction can be prominently enhanced in heavy transition metal compounds , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems , and also in rare - earth compounds .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out that , in a certain setup , the directional - dependent interaction can become the only exchange interaction between the local moments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , studies on the existance and effects of anisotropic exchange interactions on the magnetic ground state is a key to understand the physics of the heavy ion magnets , and have been investigated widely , for example in refs .  .",
    "moreover , it have been revealed that the anisotropic interactions give rise to rich physics .",
    "one of the well studied example of such anisotropic exchange interaction is the directional - dependent interaction  the ising type interaction which the spin component depends on the bond . in the ground state , the directional - dependent interaction gives rise to rich physics , engenders quantum spin liquid state  @xcite and bring about the magnetic anisotropy from fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy that arises from this mechanism is an example of so - called order - from - disorder phenomena , where the fluctuation lifts the accidental degeneracy .",
    "this is a distinct phenomenon from the spins selecting a particular direction as a consequence of the exchange anisotropy .    in the high temperature paramagnetic phase , on the other hand ,",
    "the directional - dependent interaction induce magnetic anisotrpy . in a recent paper ,",
    "the author and his collaborator reported an unusual temperature dependence of nonlinear magnetic susceptibility in a frustrated fcc magnet with the directional - dependent interactions  @xcite , which the direction of magnetic anisotropy changes between the ground state and the high - temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "this is a separate phenomenon from the temperature - dependent magnetic anisotropy in lanthanids ions . for lanthanides ,",
    "the temerature dependence of the anisotropy is attributed to the temperature dependence of the population of electrons in the excited orbital state of @xmath5 electrons  @xcite . in contrast , in the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    ", the anisotropy arises from the anisotropic interactions , therefore , should be observed well below the temperature that corresponds to the orbital splitting .",
    "this situation is more likely for the heavy transition metal oxides , as the energy scale of spin - orbit interaction , hubbard interaction between the electrons , and the crystal field splittings are roughly in the order of 0.1 - 1ev , well above the room temperature .",
    "the result suggested that the interplay of bond - dependent interactions and fluctuations potentially give rise to rich physics , not only in the low - temperature ordered phase but also in the high - temperature paramagnetic phase .",
    "so far , however , the basic properties of such effect have not been studied . in this paper",
    ", we address this question by utilizing a high - temperature expansion .",
    "we first analyse different terms in the high - temperature expansion , and discuss how the abisotropy arise from the directional - dependent interaction .",
    "in the later half , we apply the result to archetypal models with the bond - dependent ising type interactions : heisenberg - kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice and a cubic heisenberg model with the directional - dependent interactions . by using the high temperature expansion up to second order in the inverse temperature , we study the external field dependence of the free energy .",
    "we show that the second order terms from the bond - dependent interactions give rise to nonlinear susceptibility , which shows maximum along @xmath1 directions of the spin axis .",
    "we also discuss the possibiliy of observing the anisotropy by torque magnetometry .",
    "the result is potentially applicable to iridium oxides  @xcite and rucl@xmath6  @xcite .",

    "<S> magnetic anisotropy of spin models with directional - dependent interactions in the high - temperature paramagnetic phase is theoretically studied . using a high temperature expansion , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ising type directional - dependent interaction gives rise to magnetic anisotropy which depends on the temperature as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon arises from the anisotropic exchange interaction , and is distinct from the orbital effect , such as van vleck susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that while the quadratic term in the magnetization favors to point the spins along the bond , the fourth order term in magnetization prefers to point spins to the perpendicular direction . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to the heisenberg - kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice and a cubic lattice model that is potentially relevant to perovskite iridates . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in these models , the anisotropic terms in quadratic order cancels out , and the leading order for the magnetic anisotropy arises from the fourth order contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the result shows that the anisotropy from the directional - dependent interaction gives rise to @xmath1 magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> these results are potentially relevant to heavy transition metal oxides such as iridates . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observation of the magnitude of anisotropic interactions using magnetic torque measurement is also discussed . </S>"
