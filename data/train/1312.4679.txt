    "based on the high - dimensional gravity theory , dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) proposed a braneworld model @xcite in which our universe is a four - dimensional brane ( a hypersurface ) embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski space - time , please see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . in this braneworld scenario ,",
    "the gauge forces are confined on the brane , but the gravity can propagate in all dimensions freely . an infrared modification to gravity",
    "is achieved due to the existence of the so - called crossover scale @xmath1 . below the crossover scale @xmath1 , the gravity appears four - dimensional .",
    "however , above the scale @xmath1 the gravity can leak into the extra dimension and make the conventional four - dimensional gravity altered .",
    "it is due to the leakage of gravity , the current universe appears an accelerated expansion phase @xcite .",
    "there are tow branches of cosmological solutions in the dgp model , named self - accelerating branch and normal branch . in the self - accelerated branch ,",
    "late - time accelerated expansion of our universe occurs without the need of a cosmological constant .",
    "but in this case , ghost degrees of freedom in the linearized theory @xcite and substantial conflict with cosmic data @xcite appear .",
    "although , a cosmological constant or brane tension can alleviate the conflict with cosmic observation , nonlinear solutions are required to solve the ghost problem @xcite . on the normal branch",
    ", the late - time accelerated expansion can be realized after including a cosmological constant . in this case , no ghost appears .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will mainly focus on the normal branch with the aid of a cosmological constant .    to test the gravity on large scales ,",
    "the only possible tool is the cosmic observations which include the geometrical and dynamical measurements . through the geometrical measurements , for example the type ia supernova ( sn ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    ", the background evolution history can be fixed . when the information of the large scale structures is included ,",
    "the dynamical evolution , such as the growth of the matter perturbation , can be determined . combining the two sides measurements , the degeneracies between model parameters",
    "would be broken ; and a tight constraint can be obtained . in this paper , we conduct a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) study of the normal branch of the dgp model by using the currently available cosmic observations which include sn , bao and first released 15.5 months cmb data from _",
    "planck _ in the geometrical side and redshift space distortion ( rsd ) data in the dynamical side .",
    "actually , the dgp braneworld cosmology has been constrained by various cosmic observations in the past years with and without a cosmological constant in the two branches @xcite .",
    "importantly , lombriser _ et al _ @xcite constrained the two branches of the dgp braneworld cosmology exhaustively by adopting a parameterized post - friedmann ( ppf ) description of gravity , where all of the information from the cmb data , including the large scales , and its correlation with galaxies in addition to the geometrical constraints from supernovae distances and the hubble constant were utilized . where the requirement of a tension or a cosmological constant was confirmed ; and they concluded that the crossover scale must be greater than the hubble scale @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the @xmath7 c.l . with and without a spatial curvature .",
    "it was also pointed out the importance of using the large scale structure information to constrain the infrared modifications to gravity .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we try to confront the normal branch with a cosmological constant including the rsd measurement of the cosmological growth rate , @xmath8 .",
    "the rsd measurement of growth data has been used to test cosmological models @xcite . and a lower growth rate from rsd than expected from _",
    "planck _ was also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is structed as follows .",
    "in sec . [ sec : normal ] , we give a brief review of the normal branch of dgp gravity and their modifications to the linear perturbation theory .",
    "we present the results of our mcmc study in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "in dgp model @xcite , our universe is a four - dimensional brane embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski space - time described by the action @xmath9 where the quantities with hats denote the five - dimensional ones ; the lagrangian @xmath10 confined on the brane includes matter fields and brane tension or a cosmological constant ; the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are related to the reduced planck mass in the bulk and brane respectively .",
    "the crossover scale @xmath13 governs the transition from five - dimensional to four - dimensional scalar - tensor gravity .    by variation of the action , one obtains the modified friedmann equation on the brane in a homogeneous and isotropic metric @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the branch of the cosmological solutions ; @xmath16 is for the self - accelerating branch and @xmath17 is for the normal branch ; @xmath18 is the hubble parameter ; @xmath19 is the spatial curvature ; @xmath20 is the scale factor and @xmath21 are the energy components on the brane which include baryons @xmath22 , cold dark matter @xmath23 and radiation @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is a cosmological constant or brane tension on the brane .",
    "the late time accelerated expansion is determined by two model parameters , the cosmological constant and the crossover scale . using the definition of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath26 , the friedmann eq .",
    "( [ eq : ferho ] ) can be recast into @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the dimensionless expansion rate . here",
    "@xmath32 satisfies the relation @xmath33 the free model parameter can range in theory from zero to infinity . but",
    "noticing the fact that if @xmath34 the general relativity is recovered and that the deviation from general relativity on solar system scale is also controlled by @xmath1 , @xmath1 should have a very large value , at least be larger than the solar system scale .",
    "actually , the cosmic observational constraint requires that @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , to cover the limit case of general relativity , we take @xmath35 is a free model parameter instead of @xmath36 .",
    "it implies that general relativity is recovered when @xmath35 is zero . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : feomega ] ) , the five - dimensional gravity effect becomes maximal when @xmath1 approaches to @xmath4 .",
    "to understand the properties of this modification to gravity , the friedmann eq .",
    "( [ eq : ferho ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xcite @xmath37 by the definition of an effective energy density of dark energy @xmath38 it is clearly seen that the five - dimensional effect makes the effective energy density larger and smaller in the self - accelerating and normal branch respectively . from the continuity equation of the effective dark energy @xmath39 , one can derive its equation of state @xmath40^{1/2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\frac{1}{\\left[e^2(a)-\\omega_ka^{-2}\\right]^{1/2}-\\sigma\\sqrt{\\omega_{r_c}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the longitudinal gauge , the scalar linear perturbations of the metric is given as @xmath41 to derive the evolution of density and metric perturbations on the brane , the bulk metric equations are required @xcite where the quasi - static solutions with curvature was obtained . the poisson equation and the traceless part of einstein equations",
    "are given @xcite @xmath42\\rho\\delta a^2,\\\\ k^2\\psi&=&-\\frac{\\kappa^2}{2}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{3\\beta}\\right]\\rho\\delta a^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is @xmath44,\\ ] ] and @xmath45 is the gauge - invariant comoving density contrast . here",
    "@xmath46 is the density contrast .",
    "the matter perturbation in the subhorizon ( @xmath47 ) satisfies the following equation @xcite @xmath48\\delta'_m-\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{e_m}{e^2}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{3\\beta}\\right]\\delta_m=0 , \\label{eq : evolution}\\ ] ] @xmath49 . here",
    "the prime @xmath50 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath51 . via the definition of the gauge - invariant growth factor @xmath52 , which is reduced to @xmath53 in the matter comoving gauge , the perturbation evolution equation ( [ eq : evolution ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath54=\\frac{3}{2}\\left[1+\\frac{1}{3\\beta}\\right]\\omega_m(a),\\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the dimensionless dark matter energy density .",
    "therefore , a tight constrain would be obtained by using the information from @xmath8 which is almost model - independent and provides good test to dark energy models even without the knowledge of the bias or @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite compiled the redshift space distortion ( rsd ) based @xmath57 measurement , which amounts to eight @xmath57 data points in the redshift range @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "another data point at @xmath59 was also obtained in ref .",
    "for convenience , the data points are summarized in table [ tab : fsigma8data ] .",
    "the @xmath8 data points have been used to constrain dark energy model ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a example .",
    ".the data points of @xmath8 measured from rsd with the survey references . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have studied the normal branch of dgp braneworld gravity in the spatially flat case from the geometrical and dynamical perspectives through markov chain monte carlo method .    on the geometrical side , the sn , bao and cmb data from the first 15.5 months released _ planck _",
    "results are used to fix the background evolution . on the dynamical side , the growth rate @xmath60 from the measurements of the redshift space distortion",
    "is used to determine the evolution of matter perturbations .",
    "the constrained results are summarized in table [ tab : results ] . as a comparison to the previous result @xcite",
    ", a tight constraint was obtained in this work .",
    "our result suggests that the crossover scale @xmath1 should be around @xmath2 which is consistent with the previous result @xmath3 and greater .",
    "it also implies that the five - dimensional gravity effect is weak to be observed in @xmath4 scale . as a comparison to the @xmath25cdm model",
    ", we found the difference between ndgp and @xmath25cdm model is @xmath61 for one extra model parameter .",
