    "+ in the @xmath3 century it was still a major problem to follow the motion of a planet along its elliptical path or , more general , along a curved trajectory . for the @xmath2potential",
    "this difficulty was solved by the swiss mathematician and physicist johann heinrich lambert who proved geometrically that the transfer time along a planetary orbit connecting two position vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 depends only on the two combinations @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "the fact that the transfer time depends only on @xmath6 and @xmath7 is called lambert s theorem .",
    "+ the agreement between the calculated and observed positions of the planets was historically the most important success of classical physics . with the advent of quantum mechanics ,",

    "it was lambert @xcite who succeeded to map elliptical motion to collinear motion .",
    "he also proved ( @xcite , lemma 24 ) that for fixed energy @xmath18 , the classically allowed elliptic motion from a given initial point @xmath40 to a final point @xmath41 can generally occur on two different ellipses unless we have circular motion ( compare @xcite , p.  27 ) . from the last two equations it becomes obvious that the reduced action @xmath19 is a function of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that the energy dependence of @xmath19 enters through the semimajor axis @xmath58 .",

    "in quantum physics , the kepler problem becomes the coulomb problem .",

    "+ feynman s path integral method is a natural way to calculate transition amplitudes . for classically allowed transitions one has to identify all classically allowed trajectories , assign each of them with a phase and an amplitude and sum up their contribution .",
    "this procedure yields as an approximation the semiclassical amplitude . in a quantum mechanically exact calculation of the propagator one would have to sum up all paths , including the classically forbidden ones .",
    "semiclassical methods work usually very well because classical trajectories carry the main information needed to calculate the transition amplitude from @xmath62 to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , semiclassical methods are accurate and useful when large angular momenta are involved .",
