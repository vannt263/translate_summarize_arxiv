    "dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is one of the most important nonperturbative features in qcd . for the study of dcsb ,",
    "the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) formalism  @xcite has been used as an interesting and powerful method . for qcd ,",
    "the sd formalism consists of an infinite series of nonlinear integral equations which determine the @xmath2-point green s function of quarks and gluons , and therefore it includes the infinite - order effect of the qcd gauge coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , the sd equation for the quark propagator @xmath4 is described with the nonperturbative gluon propagator @xmath5 and the nonperturbative quark - gluon vertex @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the bare quark propagator and the simple notation @xmath9 has been used in the euclidean metric .    in the practical calculation for qcd",
    ", however , the sd formalism is drastically truncated : the perturbative gluon propagator and the one - loop running coupling are used instead of the nonperturbative quantities in the original formalism .",
    "this simplification seems rather dangerous because some of nonperturbative - qcd effects are neglected .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the sd equation based on the recent lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results , i.e. , the lqcd - based sd equation , and aim to construct a useful and reliable analytic framework including the proper nonperturbative effect in qcd . using the lqcd - based sd equation , we investigate also dcsb at finite temperatures .",
    "first , we briefly review the quark propagator @xmath4 in lattice qcd .",
    "the inverse quark propagator in the landau gauge is generally given by @xmath10 in the euclidean metric .",
    "here , @xmath11 is called as the quark mass function , and @xmath12 corresponds to the wave - function renormalization of the quark field . in the quark propagator",
    ", dcsb is characterized by the mass generation as @xmath13 .    the quark mass function @xmath11 in the landau gauge",
    "is recently measured in lattice qcd at the quenched level  @xcite , and the lattice data in the chiral limit is well reproduced by @xmath14 with @xmath15=260 mev , @xmath16=870mev and @xmath17=3.04",
    ". the infrared quark mass @xmath18 seems consistent with the constituent quark mass in the quark model . using this lattice result of @xmath11 , the pion decay constant",
    "is calculated as @xmath19 87 mev with the pagels - stokar formula  @xcite , and the quark condensate is obtained as @xmath20 .",
    "these quantities related to dcsb seem consistent with the standard values .",
    "in this section , we formulate the sd equation for quarks in the chiral limit in the landau gauge . by taking the trace eq.([eqn : sde1 ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for the quark - gluon vertex",
    ", we assume the chiral - preserving vector - type vertex , @xmath23 which keeps the chiral symmetry properly .",
    "( in contrast , to be strict , the higashijima - miransky approximation  @xcite explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry in the formalism . )",
    "then , one obtains @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the color factor for quarks . in the landau gauge ,",
    "the euclidean gluon propagator is generally expressed by @xmath26 where we refer to @xmath27 as the gluon polarization factor .",
    "therefore , eq.([eqn : sde3 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath28 here , we define the kernel function @xmath29 as the product of the quark - gluon vertex @xmath30 and the gluon polarization factor @xmath27 .",
    "then , the sd equation is expressed as @xmath31 in the landau gauge , the quark wave - function renormalization is not so significant and seems to be approximated as @xmath32 , which reduces the sd equation to @xmath33",
    "in this section , we extract the kernel function @xmath34 in the sd equation ( [ eqn : sde6 ] ) using the quark mass function @xmath11 obtained in lattice qcd . by shifting the integral variable from @xmath35 to @xmath22 ,",
    "we rewrite eq.([eqn : sde6 ] ) as @xmath36 therefore , we obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 is defined with @xmath11 as @xmath39 since the quark mass function @xmath11 is given by eq.([eqn : quarkmass ] ) in lattice",
    "qcd , we can calculate the kernel function @xmath0 from eq.([eqn : sde8 ] ) .    as shown in fig.1",
    ", we numerically obtained the kernel function @xmath34 extracted from the lattice qcd result for the quark propagator in the landau gauge .",
    "as remarkable features , we find  infrared vanishing \" and  intermediate enhancement \" in the kernel function @xmath0 in the sd equation .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 seems consistent with zero in the very infrared region as @xmath40 while @xmath0 exhibits a large enhancement in the intermediate - energy region around @xmath41 0.5gev .",
    "these tendencies of infrared vanishing and intermediate enhancement in the kernel function @xmath34 are observed also in the direct lattice - qcd measurement for the polarization factor @xmath27 in the gluon propagator in the landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "note here that the usage of the perturbative gluon propagator and the one - loop running coupling @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath43 , which largely differs from the present result based on lattice qcd both in the infrared and in the intermediate - energy regions .",
    "in fact , the simple version of the sd equation using the perturbative gluon propagator and the one - loop running coupling would be too crude for the quantitative study of qcd .",
    "finally , we demonstrate a simple application of the lqcd - based sd equation to chiral symmetry restoration in finite - temperature qcd .    at a finite temperature @xmath44 , the field variables obey the ( anti-)periodic boundary condition in the imaginary - time direction , which leads to the sd equation for the thermal quark mass @xmath45 of the matsubara frequency @xmath46 as @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    using the kernel function @xmath0 obtained in the previous section , we solve eq.([eqn : sdet ] ) for the thermal quark mass @xmath45 .",
    "figure 2 shows the preliminary result for the thermal infrared quark mass @xmath51 plotted against the temperature @xmath44 .",
    "we thus find chiral symmetry restoration at a critical temperature @xmath1 .",
