    "following the suggestion of @xcite , several collaborations , notably macho and eros , began to search for gravitational microlensing towards the magellanic clouds as an indicator of compact objects in the halo of the milky way @xcite . at about the same time , the ogle collaboration began a survey in the direction of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "it was soon found that a much higher event rate occurred in fields towards the galactic bulge relative to the rate towards the magellanic clouds @xcite . since 1990 , approximately 1000 such events have been detected @xcite .",
    "several groups including planet ( probing lensing anomalies network , @xcite ) , mps ( microlensing planet search , @xcite ) and @xmath1fun ( microlensing follow - up network , @xcite ) monitor events much more intensively than the survey groups in order to identify anomalous behavior that can signal the presence of a planet associated with the lens star .",
    "high - magnification events in particular ( those with @xmath2 ) attract the attention of follow - up groups since it is these that are most likely to give detectable planetary signals @xcite .",
    "in addition , for high magnification events the angular size of the source star may be non - negligible in comparison to the lens - source angular separation . in these cases the lightcurves of the events can provide the possibility to determine the lens - source relative proper motion @xcite and atmospheric properties of the source @xcite .    in the first years of operation ,",
    "when microlensing alerts came primarily from the macho collaboration , detected event rates were low enough that planet could monitor almost all potentially interesting events with ease .",
    "for the last two years ( the 2002 and 2003 bulge seasons ) , this has not been the case , due to the much improved alert rate since the advent of the ogle iii early warning system ( ews ) , http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle/ogle3/ews/ews.html @xcite . in excess of 400 events",
    "were alerted by the ews in each of these years .",
    "in addition , approximately 75 events were alerted in 2003 by the moa collaboration @xcite although some of these were duplicates of ews events .",
    "we are now in an era in which a careful selection of events is necessary to optimize planet detection and exclusion productivity .",
    "for this reason , follow - up groups require accurate predictions of eventual maximum amplications in the early days following a detection . for",
    "the remainder of this paper i will focus exclusively on events detected by the ogle iii ews .",
    "most microlensing events are well fitted by a point - source point - mass - lens ( pspl ) model for the magnification @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 the impact parameter @xmath6 is the angular separation between the source and lens measured in units of the angular einstein radius , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the lens , @xmath9 is the observer - source distance , @xmath10 the observer - lens distance , @xmath11 the source - lens distance and @xmath12 is the impact parameter at @xmath13 , the time of maximum magnification . the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relative proper motion between the lens and source .",
    "the lightcurve of a pspl event can thus be characterised by @xmath16 parameters , ( @xmath17 ) plus for each @xmath18 telescope + filter combinations , the unmagnified ( baseline ) magnitude of the source star @xmath19 and the blending parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fraction of blended ( non - lensed ) light . the maximum magnification",
    ", @xmath22 frequently replaces @xmath23 as a parameter .",
    "the conventional method for predicting peak magnifications is to use @xmath0 minimization techniques to fit pspl models to data from ogle iii ( possibly supplemented by a follow - up group s own data ) as they become available .",
    "such fits are continuously updated and the subsequent predictions revised as data accumulate . experience has shown that early predictions of eventual maximum magnification using these methods systematically yield overpredictions , strongly limiting the usefulness of such estimates .",
    "in particular , very large maximum magnifications ( with large uncertainties ) are often predicted for events that turn out to be of rather low amplitude .",
    "valuable observing time is often wasted monitoring such events in order to confirm their nature .",
    "the reason for this overprediction of values for @xmath24 is that in using @xmath0 minimization for a predictive purpose , one implicitly assumes that all parameter values are equally likely .",
    "however , for microlensing events this is far from being the case . from a purely geometrical perspective ,",
    "high magnification events are exceedingly rare . in practice ,",
    "being of high magnification , they have a higher probability of detection by a survey group .",
    "it is the individual detection efficiency of a survey convolved with the intrinsic event rates ( both of these as a function of event parameters ) that determines the magnification probability , given that an event has been detected .",
    "these ideas can be given a quantitative basis in a bayesian formulation of the problem .",
    "the merits of the bayesian approach to statistical analysis have been discussed at length elsewhere and will not be reargued @xcite . here",
    "we simply note that a bayesian formulation with appropriate priors should produce an unbiased estimate of the eventual microlensing event parameters during the rising part of a lightcurve .    from bayes theorem , the probability density for a microlensing event to have a certain set of parameter values @xmath25 , given the fact , @xmath26 , that it has been detected by the ogle iii ews and that data @xmath27 have been acquired",
    ", @xmath28 where @xmath29 . the second term on the right hand side of equation ( 6 ) , @xmath30 ( known as the prior ) , is the underlying probability density for @xmath25 given a detection , i.e. @xmath31 is the probability that @xmath25 is in the range @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "it is this function that incorporates both the natural event occurrence probability and the particular parameter sensitivities of the detection system . the first term , @xmath33 , the likelihood function for @xmath34 given @xmath27 . data from the ogle iii survey consist of @xmath35-band magnitudes and their uncertainties @xmath36 at time @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) .",
    "i assume each @xmath39 to be drawn randomly from a normal distribution @xmath40 where the true value of the magnitude at time @xmath37 is @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the magnitude evaluated from the model parameterised by @xmath25 .",
    "analagous to a @xmath0 minimization , the value of @xmath34 that maximises @xmath45 ( i.e. the posterior mode ) is taken as the best estimator of @xmath46 , the true value of @xmath25 . in the absence of a prior",
    ", this solution reduces to the minimum @xmath0 solution .",
    "we stress here that when sufficient data are available to constrain a fit to a certain event , e.g. when the event is over , the bayesian and @xmath0 minimization techniques give the same parameter values and the choice of prior is largely irrelevant . in other words ,",
    "the solution is not driven by prior probabilities when sufficent empirical information is available ( see @xcite , chapter 2 for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "if the parameters @xmath25 are statistically independent quantities , @xmath47 factorizes as @xmath48 where for brevity i have omitted `` @xmath49 '' in the probability densities on the right hand side of the equation .",
    "it is often more convenient to work in decadic logarithmic units for several of these quantities , in which case @xmath50 with @xmath51 being an arbitrary unit of time . here",
    "i define @xmath52 to be the time to peak magnification from an initial `` alert date '' . for the remainder of this paper",
    "i adopt @xmath53 .    it is worth noting that even if each parameter in @xmath25 is independent in @xmath47 , they are not independent in the likelihood function @xmath54 and hence not independent in @xmath45 .",
    "thus when fitting a model to a lightcurve , particularly when only early data are available , the fitted maximum magnification is affected not only by the prior on @xmath24 but also by the priors on the other other parameters .",
    "the criterion used by the ogle iii ews is that a blending parameter is only used when it is more than 3-@xmath55 less than unity and is larger than its formal uncertainty . in this paper",
    "i use the odds ratio test , a natural way to decide between two different models .",
    "i define the odds ratio @xmath56 where @xmath57 indicates the set of model parameters without blending ( @xmath38 when considering only ews data ) . having no _ a priori _ indication about whether to include blending",
    "i choose @xmath58 .",
    "if we assume a unform prior probability density for @xmath20 in the range @xmath59 and zero outside this range , and assuming a gaussian probability density function for @xmath20 about @xmath60 , it can be shown ( see for instance @xcite ch 4 ) that equation ( [ oreqn1 ] ) reduces to @xmath61 for cases in which @xmath60 is more than several @xmath62 away from the cutoffs imposed by the prior . otherwise , for @xmath60 close to 1 , equation ( [ oreqn1 ] ) becomes @xmath63 while for @xmath60 close to 0 @xmath64 the odds ratio is then made up of two terms .",
    "the first of these represents a relative `` goodness of fit '' between the two models while the second is the `` occam penalty '' for introducing a new parameter . only when @xmath65 and the odds ratio is less than unity is a blending parameter used in this analysis .",
    "i have used the set of microlensing events detected by the ews in 2002 to determine the parameter priors . since",
    "our interest is in the set of pspl events , i have removed 41 events that showed deviations from pspl behavior from this analysis .",
    "excluded events were numbered 18 , 23 , 40 , 51 , 68 , 69 , 77 , 80 , 81 , 99 , 113 , 119 , 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 , 131 , 135 , 143 , 149 , 159 , 175 , 194 , 202 , 203 , 205 , 215 , 228 , 229 , 232 , 238 , 254 , 255 , 256 , 266 , 273 , 307 , 315 , 339 , 348 , 360 , out of the complete set of 389 alerts .",
    "parameter values have been obtained for these events using a simplex downhill method to minimise @xmath0 ( ews estimates of @xmath24 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath20 can also be obtained from the ews web page ) .",
    "for @xmath68 we require an objective definition of an `` alert date '' that can be applied to all events .",
    "i have arbitrarily chosen a working definition of an alert date as being the date at which three successive data points have been more than 1-@xmath55 brighter than @xmath67 , the baseline magnitude . in practice , @xmath67 can be determined separately from and in advance of the other parameters .",
    "the distributions of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "for the purposes of obtaining bayesian prior probability densities for these quantities , the distribution functions are adequately represented by the following empirically - chosen functions , also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] : @xmath72   \\\\ p(\\lg ( t_{\\rm e}/t^ { * } ) ) & = & 0.476 \\exp \\left [ -(\\lg ( t_{\\rm e}/t^ { * } ) - 1.333)^2 /0.330",
    "\\right ]   \\\\ p(\\lg ( \\delta t_{\\rm 0}/t^ { * } ) ) & = & 0.156 \\exp \\left [ -(\\lg ( \\delta t_{\\rm 0}/t^ { * } ) - 1.432)^2 /0.458 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is also instructive to examine the distribution of @xmath12 , shown in figure  [ fig2](a ) . in the absence of any selection effects",
    ", this distribution should be uniform .",
    "in fact , there is an enhanced sensitivity to detection of high magnification ( low @xmath12 ) events and a rapid decrease in sensitivity for @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) also shows the shape of the adopted prior on @xmath69 ( eq .  15 ) when transformed to @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the same data but excluding those events where @xmath24 has a formal uncertainty greater than 50% .",
    "this illustrates that many high amplification events have maxima that are poorly constrained from ogle data alone .",
    "as a test of the bayesian method , i have applied a fitting procedure that maximises @xmath45 to a sample of the pspl events alerted in real time by the ogle iii ews in 2003 . these consist of events ogle-2003-bul-138 to ogle-2003-bul-462 and excluding events numbered 145 , 160 , 168 , 170 , 176 , 192 , 200 , 230 , 236 , 252 , 260 , 266 , 267 , 271 , 282 , 286 , 293 , 303 , 306 , 311 , 359 , 380 , 419 that do not appear to be due to pspl microlensing and 188 , 197 , 245 , 263 , 274 , 297 , 387 , 399 , 407 , 412 , 413 , 417 , 420 , 422 , 429 , 430 , 432 , 433 , 435 , 437 , 440 , 441 , 442 , 443 , 444 , 449 , 450 , 452 , 453 , 454 , 455 , 457 , 459 , 461 , 462 that were still ongoing at the time of writing .",
    "events ogle-2003-bul-137 and earlier were anounced by the ews in a single email at the beginning of the 2003 bulge season and thus not alerted in real time .",
    "ogle-2003-bul-238 ( a. gould 2004 , private communication ) and 262 @xcite are events in which the lens is known to have transited the source and ogle-2003-bul-208 and 222 may also involve finite source effects .",
    "these events have not been excluded . for the remaining sample of 267 events ,",
    "i have used only the ogle iii data taken before the ews alert time , defined as the reception of the alert email by the author .",
    "for the zero point of @xmath52 for each event , i have used the definition in   2 except for cases in which this has not occured before the ews alert time in which case the latter has been used as the zero point .    as mentioned in   1 , different fitting codes can produce different estimates of maximum magnifications , particularly for high - magnification events for which blending may be involved . in particular , there is a concern that a direct comparison of predictions with the ews alert predictions may suffer from such differences . in order to compare the maximum magnifications predicted by the bayesian method with those predicted using @xmath0 fitting , i have thus used very similar computer codes to make @xmath45 and @xmath0 optimisations , electing not to use the ews - fitted parameters . to avoid the problem of slightly different blending parameters resulting in large differences in derived magnifications , for each event",
    "i compute the brightness increase , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the magnitude at @xmath13 .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath76 using only the pre - alert data for an event are compared with the values determined using all the data . when all the data are available , the parameters derived using @xmath0 and @xmath77 are almost always identical .",
    "exceptions to this are in a few cases for which there are no data over the peak to constrain the fits .      the predictive performances of the bayesian and @xmath0 models at the time of ews alert are illustrated in figures  [ fig3 ]  [ fig5 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the distributions of predicted peak magnifications for both models and compares these with the eventual values .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the same data as a function of @xmath12 . for the @xmath0 models ,",
    "there is clearly a population of low @xmath12 events with predicted brightenings of more than 10 magnitudes that do not eventuate .",
    "such overpredictions are not present in the bayesian fitted models . on the other hand",
    ", there is a tendency for the bayesian models to underpredict the peak , and at alert time to fail to predict the small population of high magnification events in figure  [ fig3](a ) . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "i compare the distribution of the differences in predicted vs actual brightenings for both models .",
    "again , the tendency for the @xmath0 fits to overestimate the peak is obvious .",
    "as pointed out in   4.1 , baysesian solutions to early lightcurve data often fail to indicate the nature of high magnification events",
    ". it would be of concern if high magnification events were not observed due to this tendency . to illustrate in more detail the behavior of bayesian vs @xmath0 models , i consider here examples of low and high magnification events .",
    "these examples show several generic aspects of how bayesian vs @xmath0 solutions evolve as data accumulate .",
    "ogle-2003-blg-171 was a low magnification event ( @xmath78 ) . at this magnification",
    ", the source star barely passes within one einstein radius of the lens and the event is unsuitable for detecting a planetary anomaly .",
    "this is typical of the type of event that a follow - up program should avoid observing .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath0 and bayesian fitted lightcurves at 5 day intervals as the event evolves from its alert date .",
    "the predicted maximum magnifications corresponding to each panel are listed in table  [ tbl1 ] . at alert ,",
    "the event is predicted to be of low magnification but by jd 2452785 ( panel d in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the @xmath0 solution suggests a high magnification , albeit with a large uncertainty .",
    "since the lightcurve appears to be rising rapidly , follow - up programs may well begin observing the event in order to improve on the high uncertainty in the predicted peak magnification .",
    "as more data accumulate , the low - magnification nature of the event becomes apparent .",
    "although the true nature of the event would be identified relatively quickly by a follow - up observing program , there is a not - insignificant overhead associated with adding the event to the program .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 fit , the predicted peak magnification for the bayesian solution changes steadily with time . at no time",
    "is a high - magnification event suggested and a follow - up strategy based on this method would ignore the event .",
    "ogle-2003-blg-208 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , table  [ tbl2 ] ) reached a moderately high magnification ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "the projected source trajectory passed as close as 0.02 @xmath81 to the lens and thus had a high probability of intersecting a central caustic if it were present .",
    "the alert date for this event corresponds to panel ( c ) in figure [ fig7 ] at which time the predictions of peak magnification are @xmath82 and 4.4 for the @xmath0 and bayesian solutions respectively .",
    "the bayesian prediction of @xmath83 is sufficiently high to warrant the attention of a follow - up observing program such as planet . as data acumulate ,",
    "the @xmath0 predicted peak magnification rises until reaching @xmath84 in panel ( g ) . the true peak magnification ( @xmath85 starts to become apparent from panel ( h ) as the event peaks .",
    "in contrast , the bayesian predicted peak magnification rises steadily until the true peak magnification is identified from around the time of panels ( f )  ( g ) .",
    "the behavior illustrated by these two examples is typical . for low magnification events ,",
    "the bayesian model never indicates them as being worthy of observational follow - up . for high magnification events that should be observed ,",
    "the peak magnification is initially underestimated but adjusts to an appropriate prediction as soon as the data indicate . in all cases",
    "examined , this occurs relatively early in the event when the magnification , @xmath86 . for both high and low magnification events ,",
    "the bayesian predicted peak magnification changes smoothly while the @xmath0 prediction is prone to large changes as new data points are included .",
    "the bayesian solutions usually converge to the correct amplification earlier than the @xmath0 solutions .",
    "high magnification events provide the best opportunity for detecting signals of planets around lens stars and for obtaining upper limits on their abundances .",
    "intensive photometric monitoring programs are hampered currently by difficulties in identifying high magnification events well before peak .",
    "systems that use @xmath0 minimization to fit pspl models to early data are prone to exagerated predictions of peak magnification .",
    "such prections induce observers to spend their time monitoring events that ultimately have little statistical power .",
    "i have shown here that a predictive system based on a bayesian formalism that takes account of the characteristics of a detection system is immune to such behavior .",
    "although such a bayesian system tends to initially underpredict the peak for high magnification events , accurate prediction occurs as soon as sufficient data accumulate to justify the assertion . in all cases",
    "examined , this occurs well ahead of peak in their associated lightcurves and early enough for the events to be targeted for observation .",
    "implementation of such a system based on the ogle early warning system should result in much improved observing productivity for the 2004 season .",
