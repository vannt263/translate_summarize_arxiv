    "the high fluence values ( from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) and the huge isotropic energy emitted ( @xmath5 ) at the peak in a remarkably short prompt emission phase make grbs the most violent and energetic astrophysical phenomena .",
    "fifty years after their discovery in the 60s by the vela satellites , the nature of grbs is still unclear . notwithstanding",
    "the variety of their peculiarities , some common features may be identified by looking at their light curves .",
    "grbs have been traditionally classified as _ short _ ( @xmath6 ) and _ long _ ( @xmath7 ) , although some recent studies ( see , e.g. , norris & bonnell 2006 ) have revealed the existence of an intermediate class ( ic ) thus asking for a revision of this criterium .",
    "consequently , long grbs have now been divided into two classes , _ normal _ and _ low luminosity _ , the latter one likely being associated with supernovae . here , we concentrate our attention on the class of normal long bursts , observed in x - ray with the aim of better clarifying their origin in the view of possible systematics .",
    "a valid tool in classifying grbs is provided by the analysis of their light curves .",
    "the data observed by the beppo - sax satellite @xcite were reasonably well fitted by a simple phenomenological power - law expression , @xmath8 with @xmath9 . however , a crucial breakthrough in this field has been represented by the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in 2004 .",
    "the _ swift _ instrumental setup , composed by the _",
    "burst alert telescope _",
    "( bat , @xmath10 kev ) , the _ x - ray telescope _ ( xrt , @xmath11 kev ) and the _ ultra - violet / optical telescope _ ( uvot , @xmath12 nm ) , allows a rapid follow - up of the afterglows in different wavelengths giving better coverage of the grb light curve than the previous missions .",
    "such data revealed the existence of a more complex phenomenology with different slopes and break times thus stressing the inadequacy of a single power - law function .",
    "a significant step forward has been made by the analysis of the x - ray afterglow curves of the full sample of _ swift _ grbs showing that they may be fitted by a single analytical expression @xcite which we referred to in the following as the w07 model .",
    "it is worth stressing that finding out a universal feature would allow us to recognize if grbs are standard candles looking for correlations among their observables .",
    "the @xmath13-@xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15-@xmath14 @xcite , @xmath16-@xmath14 @xcite and @xmath16-@xmath17 @xcite correlations are some of the attempts pursued in this direction .",
    "however , the problem of large data scatter in the considered luminosity relations @xcite and a possible impact of detector thresholds on cosmological standard candles @xcite have been discussed controversially @xcite . within this wide framework",
    ", we consider here the lt correlation between the break time @xmath18 and the luminosity at the break time @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the grb redshift and with asteriks we refer to the rest frame quantities .",
    "both these observables refer to the plateau phase of the w07 model .",
    "dainotti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) first found that these quantities are not independent , but rather follow the log - linear relation , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 fixed by the fitting procedure .",
    "the lt correlation has then been confirmed @xcite and recently updated with 77 grbs @xcite leading to the discovery of a new subclass of the afterglows with smooth observed x - ray light curves , which are prefentially distributed at higher luminosities than the full distribution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the lt correlation explaining how the interested quantities are evaluated and the calibration procedure adopted .",
    "selection effects are discussed in section 3 , while the problem of a possible evolution with @xmath20 of the calibration parameters is addressed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 investigates the possibility of using the lt correlation as a redshift indicator , while a summary of the results is finally given in section 6 .",
    "the lt correlation relates the time scale @xmath1 and the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 at @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is defined as the end of the plateau phase .",
    "having had the confirmation of the existence of the above correlation @xcite , we here try to answer the question : _ is it affected by systematics ? _    as a preliminary remark ,",
    "let us remember how the quantities of interest are evaluated .",
    "the source rest frame luminosity in the _ swift _ xrt bandpass , @xmath26 kev , is computed as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the grb luminosity distance at redshift @xmath20 , @xmath29 is the measured x - ray energy flux ( in @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the k - correction . denoting with @xmath32 the _ swift _ light curve and following bloom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we get :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 the differential photon spectrum .",
    "we model this term as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the spectral and photon index , respectively .",
    "it is worth stressing that the fit of the model @xmath34 is performed considering only the spectrum of the plateau phase , selected using a filter time fixed as @xmath37 ; the @xmath25 values together with their errorbars , @xmath38 , are derived in the fitting procedure @xcite .",
    "as shown also in previous xrt spectral analysis @xcite , this particular choice of the filter time leads to the single power - law function as a better fit than the more commonly assumed band function @xcite . according to the w07 model , the functional expression for @xmath32",
    "is :    @xmath39    where the first term accounts for the prompt ( the index `` p '' ) @xmath40-ray emission and the initial x - ray decay , while the second one describes the afterglow ( the index `` a '' ) .",
    "both components are modeled with the same functional form :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 = @xmath43 or @xmath22 .",
    "the transition from the exponential to the power law occurs at the point @xmath44 where the two functional sections have the same value and gradient .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 is the temporal power law decay index and the time @xmath46 is the the initial rise time scale .",
    "we refer to willingale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for further details on the analysis , while we only remind here that a usual @xmath47 fitting of the @xmath48 vs @xmath49 data provides estimates and uncertainties on the time parameters @xmath50 and the products @xmath51 .    for the afterglow part of the light curve , we have computed values @xmath0 ( eq . [ eq : lx ] ) at the time @xmath25 , which marks the end of the plateau phase and the beginning of the last power law decay phase .",
    "we have considered the following approximation which takes into accounts the functional form , @xmath52 , of the afterglow component only :    @xmath53    where we set @xmath54 because in most cases the afterglow component is fixed at the transition time of the prompt emission , @xmath55 .",
    "actually , we are using eq.([eq : fluxafterglow ] ) , instead of ( [ eq : fluxtot ] ) since the contribution of the prompt component is typically smaller than @xmath56 , much lower than the statistical uncertainty on @xmath57 . neglecting @xmath58",
    "thus allows to reduce the error on @xmath59 without introducing any bias .",
    "this latter error is then estimated by simply propagating those on @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 thus implicitly assuming that their covariance is null . inserting eqs.([eq : fluxafterglow ] ) and ( [ eq : fx ] ) into eq.([eq : lxgeneral ] ) , one then obtains :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the observed flux at the time @xmath25 .    as a final important remark",
    ", we note that the presence of the luminosity distance @xmath28 in eq.([eq : lx ] ) constrains us to adopt a cosmological model to compute @xmath0 .",
    "we then use a flat @xmath65cdm model so that the luminosity distance reads :    @xmath66    in agreement with the wmap seven year results @xcite , we set @xmath67 with @xmath68 the hubble constant @xmath69 in units of @xmath70 .      let us suppose that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two quantities related by a linear relation    @xmath73    and denote with @xmath74 the intrinsic scatter around this relation .",
    "calibrating such a relation means determining the two coefficients @xmath75 and the intrinsic scatter @xmath74 . to this aim",
    ", we will resort to a bayesian motivated technique @xcite thus maximizing the likelihood function @xmath76}$ ] with :    @xmath77    where the sum is over the @xmath78 objects in the sample .",
    "note that , actually , this maximization is performed in the two parameter space @xmath79 since @xmath23 may be estimated analytically as :    @xmath80 \\left [ \\sum{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{int}^2 + \\sigma_{r_i}^2 + a^2 \\sigma_{q_i}^2 } } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\label{eq : calca}\\ ] ]    so that we will not consider it anymore as a fit parameter .",
    "the above formulae easily applies to our case setting @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on @xmath83 by propagating the errors on @xmath84 .",
    "the bayesian approach used here also allows us to quantify the uncertainties on the fit parameters . to this aim , for a given parameter @xmath85",
    ", we first compute the marginalized likelihood @xmath86 by integrating over the other parameter . the median value for the parameter @xmath85 is then found by solving :    @xmath87    the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) confidence range @xmath90 are then found by solving :    @xmath91    @xmath92    with @xmath93 ( 0.95 ) for the @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) range respectively .",
    "dainotti et al . ( 2010 , hereafter d10 ) have recently updated the lt correlation using a sample of 77 grbs with known redshift and _ swift _ x - ray afterglow light curves . d10",
    "have defined a fit error parameter @xmath94 , measured in the burst rest frame , to analyze how accuracy of fitting the canonical lightcurve , ( eq . [ eq : fluxtot ] and [ eq : fc ] ) to the data influences the studied correlations .",
    "this definition is used to distinguish the canonical shaped light curves from the more irregular ones , perturbed by secondary flares and various non uniformities .",
    "d10 have then defined a fiducial sample selecting only grbs with @xmath95 and excluding the ic objects thus selecting 62 out of the original 77 grbs . to be consistent with d10",
    ", we here still consider only the fiducial sample . as a general remark",
    ", we would like to stress that the study of a whatever correlation among grbs observables should involve only physically homogenous subsamples thus motivating our exclusion of the ic grbs because of their different properties from the long ones that mainly constitute our sample .",
    "in other words , with homogenous sample we indicate a subsample of grbs that have lightcurves well defined , in the sense that the willingale model represents with very good accuracy the parameters values representing the afterglow and the plateau . as a consequence",
    "this subsample tightly obeys to the correlation and from this evidence we infer that the properties of the grbs in this subset are the same .",
    "for example , the xrfs are included in the subsample , since they obey to the correlations , giving in this way evidence to the theory according to which they have the same progenitor mechanism of the normal long grbs .",
    "+    +    as a first indicator for the existence of a relation , we use the spearman correlation coefficient @xmath96 @xcite providing a non - parametric measure of the statistical significance of the dependence between two quantities .",
    "fig.[rho ] shows @xmath97 as a function of the threshold @xmath98 value , used to exclude from the fiducial sample grbs with @xmath99 .",
    "as we can note , the smaller @xmath98 is , the larger @xmath96 is , i.e. the more we are confident that a statistically meaningful correlation indeed exists .",
    "the same figure also shows a similar analysis for @xmath100 suggesting that also the slope @xmath60 of the grb spectrum and the break time @xmath101 are correlated .",
    "it is worth noting that the smaller @xmath102 , the smaller the error on @xmath103 is .",
    "examining the light curves , we find that small errors are obtained for the grbs that follow better the w07 model .",
    "we therefore argue that both the lt and @xmath60-@xmath101 correlations are statistically meaningful provided the grbs in the sample belong to the class well described by the w07 model .    in order to better investigate the impact of the @xmath102 selection",
    ", we fit the lt correlation to grbs subsamples obtained by selecting only those objects with @xmath104 with @xmath98 running from 0.095 to 4 in steps of 0.01 ( with @xmath105 for the fiducial sample and @xmath106 for the canonical ones ) . the upper left panel in fig.[fig : bestfitsn ]",
    "shows that the number of grbs in the sample obviously increases with @xmath98 , but the price to pay is including grbs with large errors on @xmath103 .",
    "such large uncertainties may be due to bad sampling or to a less precise determination of the parameters fitted within the w07 model . in both cases , the estimated values of the fit parameters @xmath107 are not reliable so that it is a safer option to not include large @xmath102 grbs in the analysis of correlations .",
    "our chosen value @xmath108 represents a compromise between the need to assemble a statistically meaningful sample and avoiding uncertain couples @xmath103 that can unnecessarily increase the intrinsic scatter .    as a first interesting result",
    ", we find that the intrinsic scatter @xmath74 is smaller for smaller @xmath98 selected samples , with a sharp drop for @xmath109 .",
    "the high values of @xmath110 and the decreasing scatter point towards a scenario where the grbs most deviating from the lt correlation are actually the ones with the less precise determination of the fitted parameters consistent with our guess that their estimated values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 are not reliable .",
    "it is worth wondering whether selecting on @xmath102 biases the calibration parameters @xmath75 .",
    "upper right and lower left panels in fig.[fig : bestfitsn ] indeed shows a clear increase of @xmath23 as @xmath98 gets smaller , while the slope @xmath22 of the correlation remains almost constant at the value @xmath113 , consistent with the results in d10 that the small @xmath102 grbs ( referred to as canonical grbs in d10 ) define an subsample @xmath2 for the lt correlation .",
    "actually , one has also to consider the error bars on the fitted parameters although we remember that @xmath23 is actually correlated to @xmath22 and @xmath74 being analitically set by eq.([eq : calca ] ) .",
    "when the large error bars are taken into account , @xmath22 can indeed be considered independent on @xmath98 , while the trend with @xmath98 of the zeropoint @xmath23 remains meaningful .",
    "we place here a general explanation on the size of the error bars presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfitsn ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : uthlxtest ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : deltamu ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : muvsz ] , namely how the uncertainties on the calibration parameters have been derived . the size of the uncertainties does not reflect only the scatter in the data in the plots , in fact we can note that they are greater than @xmath114 , since they reflect also the intrinsic scatter in the law @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , in fig . [",
    "fig : uthlxtest ] the errorbars represented are not directly obtained from the equ . [ eq : lx ] but they are computed as the median absolute deviation from the median of the parameters .",
    "the median values of the observables in the grbs lightcurves present highly scatter since they reflect intrinsic inhomogeneities in the parameters values . as discussed in detail in our previous papers @xcite , the constraints on @xmath115 have been obtained by running a monte carlo markov chain algorithm to explore the parameter space @xmath116 , while @xmath23 is analytically derived through eq.([eq : calca ] ) . to this end , we run two chains , check convergence through the gellman - rubin test @xcite and finally merge them to estimate the median value and the @xmath88 and @xmath89 confidence ranges .",
    "figs.[probability ] and [ probabilityup ] show these histograms histogram .",
    "because of parameters degeneracy , there will be different possibilities to get a value of @xmath23 close to the best fit one .",
    "since the code preferentially selects models with @xmath116 as close as possible to the best fit parameters , we will get a lot of couples @xmath116 giving almost the same @xmath23 value . in order to show the full @xmath23 distribution ,",
    "we have chosen a range much larger than what is actually needed so that the central bin ( i.e. , the one which the best fit @xmath23 lies within ) will be much more populated than the other ones hence explaining the peak in the figures . note also that the first bin in the @xmath117 plots is less populated because it is the one corresponding to the best fit parameters . in order to reach convergence , the mcmc code must first find the best fit and then move away from here so that the first bin is not the most populated one . ] for the fits to the 77 grbs with @xmath95 and the u0095 sample .",
    "therefore , the error bars in fig.[fig : bestfitsn ] are determined not only by the scatter in the data , but also by the degeneracies among the model parameters . moreover , being the distributions mildly asymmetric , the @xmath88 confidence range should not be meant as @xmath118 error although we use these abuse of terminology for sake of simplicity .",
    "when comparing the results of the fits to the different @xmath102 selected samples , one should therefore compare the histograms on @xmath115 and then consider the calibration parameters of different fits in agreement if the corresponding histograms well overlap .",
    "this is , for instance , the case for the fiducial and u0095 samples .",
    "we note that the median values of the distributions are different , being ( @xmath119 ) for the fiducial sample and ( @xmath120 ) for the u0095 one . however , the histograms for @xmath22 well overlap",
    "so that we find no statistical meaningful difference , while this is the case for both @xmath23 ( although weak ) and @xmath74 .",
    "the error bars plotted in fig.[fig : bestfitsn ] allow a quick check for the samples with varying @xmath102 making us confident that the trends commented above based only on the median values are statistically meaningful .",
    "+    +    +    up to now , we have interpreted the selection on @xmath102 as a way to find out the grbs most closely following the w07 model .",
    "it is worth wondering whether such a selection biases in some way the sample by selecting only , e.g. , high luminosity grbs or the shortest ones . to this end",
    ", we show in fig.[fig : uthlxtest ] the median values ( with the median deviation ) of @xmath121 as function of the threshold value used for the error parameter @xmath102 .",
    "as these plots clearly show , there is no trend of the median values of @xmath122 with @xmath102 , namely the invariance of @xmath102 with respect to @xmath123 corresponds directly to invariance in the samples that result when grbs are chosen for certain @xmath102 . indeed , even neglecting the large error bars , errors .",
    "note also that the first point in every distribution has a larger error bar since the corresponding sample is made out of only 4 grbs with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we still plot this point for completeness although it is likely statistically meaningless . ]",
    "the median values keep constant showing that the samples selected by imposing @xmath124 sample the same region in the parameter space @xmath122 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the definition of @xmath102 depends directly on @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , the direct dependence on the possible biases on the sample depends on the parameter values that characterize @xmath102 . nevertheless , to be confident that correlation among the parameters will not affect the sample selection we have tested also the median values of @xmath60 vs @xmath102 , because there is an indication of a correlation among @xmath128 vs @xmath60 especially for the limiting @xmath129 sample , @xcite .",
    "all the tests described clearly shows that the selection on @xmath102 is only a way to find out the grbs following as close as possible the willingale s model , but this criterion do nt bias the samples . as a consequence",
    ", we can conclude that the smaller scatter of the lt correlation for canonical grbs is not a product of selection effects , but rather the outcome of a ( still to be understood ) physical mechanism .",
    "a careful inspection of the @xmath130 vs @xmath131 plot suggests that the most deviating points are the low luminosity grbs .",
    "we have therefore repeated the above analysis by selecting samples with @xmath132 with @xmath133 running from @xmath134 to @xmath135 in steps of 0.15 . as shown in the right panels of fig.[fig : uthlxtest ] , such a selection criterion do not bias the sample in @xmath121 hence suggesting that the intrinsic scatter of the lt correlation could be reduced by using only moderately bright gbrs . however , since we do not have a physical motivation for applying such a criterion , we have not carried out this analysis .",

    "similarly , the closest grbs is at @xmath142 , but the second one is at @xmath143 .",
    "the redshift distribution has played , up to now , no role in our analysis since the lt correlation has been fitted to the full grbs sample thus implicitly assuming that the calibration coefficients @xmath115 are the same over this wide redshift range .",
    "it is worth wondering whether this is actually the case . to this end , we have therefore recalibrated the @xmath24 correlation dividing the grbs in three equally populated redshift bins .",
    "note that we use here the fiducial sample ( @xmath95 ) in order to have a good statistics .",
    "if we had chosen , for instance , a set with @xmath144 , only 11 grbs per bin would be present thus leading to large errors preventing any comparison .",
    "the results summarized in table [ table1 ] and shown in fig.[fig : redshiftbin ] allow us to draw some interesting remarks .",
    "firstly , we note that , although the intrinsic scatter is quite large ( mainly because of the use of the fiducial rather than the up sample ) , the correlation coefficient @xmath110 is quite large in all the redshift bins thus arguing in favour of the existence of lt correlation at any @xmath20 .",

    "the zeropoint @xmath23 is consistent among the three bins .",
    "although a trend in the median values of @xmath22 is present , we therefore can not conclude that the lt correlation becomes shallower for higher redshift grbs because of the paucity of the sample and the inclusion of large @xmath102 grbs .",

    "we have applied the above test values are different in the two cases . ] to the fiducial @xmath167 and the u0095 samples @xmath168 finding out that the lt correlation can still not be used as a redshift estimator , as clearly shown in fig.[redshiftestimator ] . indeed , defining @xmath169",
    ", we get only @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) of grbs in the fiducial ( u0095 ) sample has @xmath172 .",
    "even if we allow for a very poor precision considering as acceptable estimates those with @xmath173 , the fraction of successful solutions raises only to a modest @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) for the fiducial ( u0095 ) samples .",
    "the qualitative agreement about the bad performance of this estimator for both the fiducial and u0095 samples is a first evidence that the value of @xmath102 has no impact on the quality of the redshift estimate .",
    "this is also shown in fig.[redshiftestimator ] where the points closer to the @xmath176 line are not the ones with the smaller @xmath102 values .",
    "actually , such a result can be easily understood noting that , as yet demonstrated above , the @xmath102 selection does not bias the samples so that the underlying motivation why this redshift estimator fail applies equally to all grbs notwithstanding how precise is the measurement of @xmath177 . actually , the main motivation of the failure is the intrinsic scatter of the points around the best fit lt correlation .",
    "it is quite easy to qualitatively understand this point considering a hypothetical grb of the u0095 sample with given value of @xmath61 . because of the intrinsic scatter of the lt correlation",
    ", its estimated intrinsic luminosity @xmath178 can be off from the true one up to @xmath74 .",
    "let us denote with @xmath179 and @xmath180 its true and fitted @xmath181 values and let @xmath182 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath20 is obtained by solving @xmath183 , while it is @xmath184 .",
    "should @xmath180 be larger than @xmath179 , we should increase @xmath28 to compensate for the difference thus overestimating the redshift @xmath185 with the opposite effect for the @xmath186 case .",
    "this is indeed what happens in our case .",
    "looking at the residuals of the lt correlation , we find that @xmath181 is , on average , underestimated ( i.e. , @xmath186 ) for the higher redshift grbs so that we expect @xmath187 which is indeed what we find looking at the points with @xmath188 in fig.[redshiftestimator ] , while the opposite result takes place for very low @xmath20 grbs .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the lt correlation works satisfactorily well as redshift estimator only for grbs in the redshift range @xmath189 , while gives severely biased results for smaller and larger @xmath20 grbs .",
    "although these results are quite discouraging , it is nevertheless worth wondering whether the situation can be improved with future data . to this end",
    ", we have simulated a u0095 sample generating @xmath190 values from a parent distribution closely mimicking the observed one for the fiducial sample parameter space as the fiducial ones . ] .",
    "we then set @xmath191 extracting from a gaussian distribution centered on the value predicted by the lt correlation and with width equal to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "we then use these values to estimate @xmath29 and add noise to all quantities so that the relative errors are the same order as the present day ones .",
    "we generate @xmath78 grbs and fit them with the same procedure adopted to find the lt calibration coefficients and use these fake markov chains as input to the redshift estimate procedure .",
    "it turns out that increasing the sample is not a useful way to improve the performance of the redshift estimator .",
    "indeed , we have found that , with @xmath192 , the fraction of grbs with @xmath172 first increases to @xmath193 and then decreases to @xmath170 for @xmath194 , while @xmath195 for both @xmath192 and @xmath194 , a significant improvement with respect to the value quoted above , but still not fully satisfactory considering that @xmath196 .",
    "it is somewhat counterintuitive that increasing the sample does not improve the quality of the redshift estimator .",
    "actually , such a result could be anticipated noting that a larger sample leads to stronger constraints on the @xmath115 values , but do not change the intrinsic scatter which is the main source of possible mismatches between the true and fitted grb luminosity .",
    "motivated by this consideration , we therefore perform a second test artificially lowering the intrinsic scatter @xmath74 , but setting the best fit @xmath75 parameters to those derived from the fit to the u0095 sample . indeed , for @xmath197 and @xmath198",
    ", we get @xmath199 with @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) of grbs with @xmath203 . again increasing the sample to @xmath194",
    "has not a significant impact , while a stronger impact is obtained setting @xmath204 giving @xmath205 with @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "these results convincingly show that the lt correlation could be used as a redshift estimator only if a subsample of the canonical grbs could be identified in such a way to reduce the intrinsic scatter to @xmath208 .",
    "it is worth wondering whether assembling such a sample is indeed possible .",
    "actually , a detailed answer can not be given since our u0095 sample is too small to find out some indicator that can help to find out grbs less scattering from the best fit lt correlation .",
    "a visual inspection of the fit residuals makes us roughly argue that @xmath74 could be reduced using only 5 out of the 8 u0095 grbs which represent @xmath209 of the fiducial grbs sample .",
    "if we assume this fraction as a constant , one should assemble a sample of @xmath210 grbs with measured values of @xmath211 to get @xmath212 grbs to calibrate the lt correlation with @xmath213 . while this is for sure an ambitious task , it is worth noting that it is still possible that a smaller sample is enough to find out the observable properties of these grbs thus allowing an easier search and reducing the number of grbs to be followed up for the @xmath20 estimate .",
    "the analysis presented here have shown that the lt correlation , for both the fiducial and ue samples , is not affected by selection effects induced by the @xmath102 threshold selection or by the implicit assumption of redshift independence of the calibration parameters .",
    "in particular , the selection on @xmath102 does not bias the distribution of the @xmath121 quantities thus showing that the canonical grbs ( @xmath214 ) in the @xmath2 sample are indeed distributed preferentially in the upper part of the lt plane .",
    "this is a further evidence that the afterglow light curves which are smooth and well fitted by the w07 model indeed define a physically homogenous class with the remarkable feature of obeying a well defined empirical correlation .",
    "furthermore , the analysis presented also pinpoints the existence of a well defined correlation of the x - ray spectral index @xmath60 with the rest frame break time @xmath1 which deserves further analysis .    as an important result",
    ", we have also shown that , although a shallowing of the lt correlation for higher @xmath20 grbs can still not be totally excluded , its impact on the distance modulus estimate is negligible thus validating the usage of this correlation as a new independent cosmological tool @xcite . as a first application , cardone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have indeed derived the hubble diagram using the lt correlation only and shown that , when combined with other distance probes ( such as type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations ) , grbs are a valuable tool to constrain the cosmological parameters . to this end , cardone et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have used the full fiducial sample to increase the statistics , but at the price of including grbs with large errors on the distance modulus .",
    "it is worth wondering how large a grb sample should be to improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "such a problem has yet been addressed by some of us @xcite using the fisher matrix analysis and the first version of the lt correlation .",
    "there , we have shown that combining a sample of 200 grbs with a snap - like sneia sample allows to determine the matter density parameter @xmath215 and the dark energy equation of state parameters @xmath216 within 0.019 , 0.036 , 0.020 , respectively .",
    "in particular , grbs are of extremely importance to constrain @xmath215 giving an improvement in precision of a factor 4 with respect to the case when sneia only are used .",
    "although these results refer to the first version of the lt correlation and thus refer to a sample with no selection on @xmath102 , they qualitatively hold also in our case since the basic inputs to the fisher matrix analysis are essentially the same . actually , having made no cut on @xmath102 , the quoted results are likely to be quite conservative since the @xmath102 selection allows to reduce the scatter and hence the error on the distance modulus thus increasing the efficiency of grbs with respect to the case considered in cardone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "we have , finally , investigated the possibility to use the lt correlation as a redshift estimator obtaining actually discouraging results for both the fiducial and u0095 samples . having qualitatively discovered the reason of this failure , we have shown that reducing the intrinsic scatter of the lt correlation could help to calibrate an improved lt correlation that could work as a tool to estimate the grb redshift from the analysis of its x - ray afterglow lightcurve .",
    "however , we are not sure if it is possible to obtain a reduced intrisic scatter of the correlation with the real data measurements related to the u0095 sample .",
