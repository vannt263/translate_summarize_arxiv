    "the density matrix is a very useful tool in the numerical study of interacting systems . besides being used in the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite and its higher - dimensional generalizations,@xcite",
    "the density matrix is also used as a diagnostic tool in the contractor renormalization ( core ) method for numerical renormalization group in two dimensions,@xcite and forms the basis of a method to identify the order parameter related to a quasi - degeneracy of ground states.@xcite    in previous work,@xcite we extended the results of chung and peschel@xcite to write the density matrix ( dm ) of a cluster of @xmath3 sites cut out from a system of noninteracting spinless fermions in @xmath4 dimensions as the exponential of a quadratic operator , called the pseudo - hamiltonian , as it resembles the hamiltonian of a noninteracting system .",
    "that result was then applied in numerical studies of noninteracting spinless fermions in one dimension , to better understand how the distribution of cluster dm eigenvalues scale with @xmath3 , and to explore the possibility of designing truncation schemes based on the pseudo - hamiltonian.@xcite we believe truncation schemes such as that described in ref .",
    "will be helpful to the choice of basis states in renormalization groups such as core .",
    "thus , some questions motivating the present paper were : ( i ) does the density matrix of an interacting fermi - liquid system resembles that of a noninteracting one ?",
    "( ii ) can we apply our exact result in ref .   to two dimensions as well as for one dimension ?",
    "( iii ) is it numerically practical to compute this sort of density matrix in a fermion system . to answer these questions",
    ", we investigated a spinless analog of the extended hubbard model , given by the hamiltonian @xmath5 in the limit of @xmath6 , so that fermions are not allowed to be nearest neighbors of each other .",
    "this model is chosen for two reasons : ( i ) for a given number of particles , the @xmath6 hilbert space is significantly smaller than the @xmath7 hilbert space , and we can work numerically with larger system sizes ; and ( ii ) the model , in spite of its simplicity , has a rich zero - temperature phase diagram,@xcite where we find practically free fermions in the limit @xmath8 , and an inert solid at half - filling @xmath9 .",
    "as the filling fraction approaches quarter - filling from below , @xmath10 , the system becomes congested , highly correlated , but is nonetheless a fermi liquid , perhaps with additional orders that are not clear in small systems . slightly above quarter - filling , the dense fluid and inert solid coexists , while slightly below half - filling , the system is expected to support stable arrays of stripes .    to probe this rich variety of structures in the ground state at different filling fraction @xmath2 ,",
    "we describe in section  [ sect : formulation ] how the reduced dm of a small cluster , with the appropriate symmetry properties , can be calculated from a finite non - square system subject to twist boundary conditions .",
    "then in section  [ sect : ni ] , we investigate in great details the cluster dm spectra of the noninteracting system , particularly on how to handle finite size effects in the numerics , for comparison with the cluster dm spectra of a strongly - interacting system , presented in section  [ sect : strong ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : summary ] , we summarized our findings , and discuss the prospects of designing an operator - based dm truncation scheme for interacting systems , at some , if not at all , filling fractions .",
    "in this section , we give the theoretical formulations and describe the numerical tools needed to investigate the cluster dm spectra of noninteracting and strongly - interacting systems of spinless fermions in two dimensions . in section  [",
    "sect : cdmf ] , we give the matrix elements of the dm of a small cluster embedded within a larger , but still finite , system .",
    "these matrix elements are obtained by tracing out degrees of freedom external to the cluster , starting from the ground - state wave function of the system , obtained through exact diagonalization . in section  [",
    "sect : sysdef ] , we describe how our finite systems can be defined with nonsquare periodic boundary conditions , and how we make use of the translational invariance of both noninteracting and strongly - interacting models to reduce the computational efforts in exact diagonalization . in section  [ sect : averaging ] , we describe several averaging apparatus required to obtain a handle on the infinite - system spectra of the cluster dm , and then in section  [ sect : states ] , we describe a classification scheme for the one - particle and multi - particle eigenstates of the cluster dm that makes the symmetry of the underlying square lattice explicit .",
    "the dm @xmath11 of a cluster cut out from a larger system is a density operator which gives the expectation @xmath12 for any observable @xmath13 local to the cluster , when the larger system is in its ground state @xmath14 .",
    "the cluster dm @xmath11 can be calculated from the ground - state dm @xmath15 of the system , by tracing out degrees of freedom outside of the cluster .",
    "we write this as @xmath16 where the subscript @xmath17 denotes a trace over environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "since a cluster is a collection of sites identified in real space , it is natural to choose as a many - body basis the real - space configurations . for a finite two - dimensional system with @xmath18 sites , we label the sites @xmath19 through @xmath20 , so that for any pair of sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath25 .",
    "we then distinguish between sites within the cluster , of which there are @xmath3 of them , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ,  , @xmath28 , and sites outside of the cluster , of which there are @xmath29 of them , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,  , @xmath32 .",
    "we think of the @xmath33 sites outside the cluster as constituting the _ environment _ to the cluster .",
    "we work with the configuration basis states @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the @xmath36 occupied sites in the system .",
    "these can be thought of as a direct product of the configuration basis states of the cluster @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the @xmath39 occupied sites within the cluster , and the configuration basis states of the environment @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the @xmath42 occupied sites in the environment . here , we have the occupied sites of the system @xmath43 being the union of the occupied sites in the cluster and in the environment , with the site indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 resorted in ascending order to give the site indices @xmath46 .    in terms of the configuration basis of the system , the ground - state wave function of the system can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the amplitude associated with configuration @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 are fermion annihilation and creation operators acting on the site @xmath52 .",
    "we can also write the ground - state wave function as @xmath53 in terms of the direct product of configuration bases of the cluster and the environment , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are fermion annihilation and creation operators acting on site @xmath56 within the cluster , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are fermion annihilation and creation operators acting on site @xmath59 within the environment . in , the amplitude @xmath60 is taken directly from the expansion in , while the factor @xmath61 accounts for the fermion sign incurred when we reorder the operator product @xmath62 to get the operator product @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , the ground - state dm in can be written as @xmath64 using the system - wide configuration basis , or as @xmath65 using the direct - product basis between cluster configurations and environment configurations .    performing the trace over the environment",
    "as prescribed in , we find the fermion cluster dm @xmath11 to be @xmath66 its matrix elements are @xmath67    these matrix elements can be computed naively by running over all possible pairs of cluster states @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and performing the sums over @xmath70 and @xmath71 as they appear in , looking up the fermion - sign factors @xmath61 and amplitudes @xmath72 as and when they are needed .",
    "we call this the _ naive algorithm_. alternatively , we can also reorganize the fermion - sign - factor - adjusted amplitudes @xmath73 into a matrix @xmath74 , whose rows are associated with the cluster configurations @xmath68 , and whose columns are associated with the environment configurations @xmath75 , the matrix @xmath11 can be computed directly by matrix multiplication as @xmath76 representing a collection of inner products .",
    "we call this the _ pre - sorted inner - product algorithm_. we compare and analyze the computational complexity of these two algorithms in appendix [ appendix : computational ] . in the numerical studies presented in section [",
    "sect : strong ] , we use the pre - sorted inner - product algorithm exclusively .    from",
    ", we see that the cluster dm @xmath11 is manifestly hermitian , and thus all its eigenvalues @xmath77 are real ( and in fact nonnegative ) . when obtained from the wave function of a state with definite particle number , @xmath11 has no matrix elements between cluster states containing different number of particles , and thus the eigenstates @xmath78 of @xmath11 can be organized into _ sectors _ , corresponding to @xmath79 particles within the cluster . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we would refer to the eigenvalues of @xmath11 generically as its _ weights _ , since these have a natural probabilistic interpretation .",
    "a @xmath39-particle weight of @xmath11 is therefore an eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenstate containing @xmath39 particles within the cluster .      for noninteracting spinless fermions on an infinite square lattice ,",
    "it is possible to compute the cluster dm @xmath11 starting from the fermi sea ground state , through the evaluation and diagonalization of @xmath80 . for an interacting system , we need to compute @xmath11 starting from @xmath81 in , the latter we obtain through exact diagonalization on a finite system .",
    "we define the a finite system relative to the infinite square lattice in terms of the lattice vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as shown in fig.[fig : system ] , such that @xmath84 is the number of lattice sites within the system .     and @xmath83 .",
    "we shall denote such a system as @xmath85 . in this example",
    "shown , the system is @xmath86 . ]    if we impose periodic boundary condition such that @xmath87 , then in the exact diagonalization to obtain @xmath14 we can take advantage of translational invariance through the use of the bloch states @xmath88 as our computational basis@xcite . in this bloch state ,",
    "the configurations @xmath89 are all related to the generating configuration @xmath90 by the lattice translations @xmath91 associated with displacement @xmath92 , while @xmath93 are wave vectors allowed by the boundary conditions .",
    "any configuration within the collection of translationally - related configurations @xmath89 can serve as the generating configuration , but we pick the one with the least sum of indices of occupied sites .",
    "working with finite non - square systems introduces several complications .",
    "first of all , we sometimes end up with degenerate ground states which suffer from symmetry - breaking not found in the true infinite - system ground state . however , because the point symmetry group of our non - square finite system is only a subgroup of the square lattice point symmetry group , the finite - system ground - state manifold is not invariant under all square lattice symmetry operations .",
    "thirdly , when working with finite systems , we introduce systematic deviations which are collectively known as _ finite size effects_. we identify the three primary sources of finite size effects as ( i ) finite domain effect , which has to do with the fact that the small set of discrete wave vectors allowed are not adequately representative of the continuous set of wave vectors on the infinite square lattice ; ( ii ) shell effect , which has to do with the fact that the set of discrete wave vectors allowed are organized by symmetry into shells in reciprocal space , each of which can be partially or fully filled in the many - body ground state ; and ( iii ) shape effect , which has to do with the detailed shape of the non - square system we introduced .        to eliminate these numerical artefacts , we adopted three averaging devices .",
    "first , we average over the @xmath94-fold degenerate ground - state manifold .",
    "our first motivation for doing so is as follows : if @xmath95 is the point symmetry group of the square lattice , and its subgroup @xmath96 is the point symmetry group of the @xmath85 system , then we will find that the cluster density matrices @xmath97 one for each wave function @xmath98 within the @xmath94-fold degenerate ground - state manifold , are not invariant under @xmath96 , much less @xmath95 .",
    "we remove this artificial symmetry breaking by calculating the degeneracy - averaged cluster dm @xmath99 over the cluster density matrices @xmath100 within the ground - state manifold .",
    "this degeneracy - averaged cluster dm is invariant under @xmath96 .",
    "a second motivation for such a mode of averaging over the degenerate ground - state manifold of the finite system is that thermodynamically , given the pure state density matrices @xmath101 , with energy eigenvalue @xmath102 , we typically construct the canonical ensemble dm as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the canonical partition function .",
    "states within a degenerate manifold have the same energy , and therefore contribute equally to the thermodynamic dm @xmath105 . in the limit of @xmath106 ,",
    "the usual thermodynamic argument is that pure states decouple from one another , and we treat their respective density matrices independently , except for those states which are degenerate .",
    "because they appear with the same boltzmann weight whatever the inverse temperature is , we should still treat the uniform combination instead of the individual density matrices in the limit of @xmath106 ,      the second averaging device involves an average over the orientation of the finite non - square system relative to the underlying square lattice .",
    "this averaging restores the @xmath95-symmetry to the averaged ground state . in principle , this requires us to compute @xmath11 for a group of four systems : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "however , if the cluster whose dm we are calculating is invariant under the action of @xmath95 , this averaging can be achieved by computing @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a point group transformation of the square lattice , @xmath113 is the unitary transformation of the cluster hilbert space associated with @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the order of @xmath95 .",
    "after these two averagings , the cluster dm has the full symmetry ( including translations ) of the underlying square lattice , but finite size effects remain .",
    "we eliminate these as much as we can@xcite with the third averaging device , twist boundary conditions averaging.@xcite the usual way to implement twist boundary conditions is to work in the _ boundary gauge _ , keeping the hamiltonian unchanged , and demanding that @xmath116 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the lattice vectors defining our finite system , @xmath117 is a site within the system , and @xmath118 is the twist vector parametrizing the twist boundary conditions .    in choice of gauge , the hamiltonian is not manifestly invariant under translations",
    ". however , we can continue to block - diagonalize it using the bloch basis states defined in , provided the set of allowed wave vectors @xmath93 are shifted relative to @xmath119 for the usual periodic boundary conditions by the twist vector @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121    the other natural way to implement twist boundary conditions is in the _ bond gauge _",
    ", where we make the substitution @xmath122 in the hamiltonian , but demand that @xmath123 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the lattice vectors defining our finite system .",
    "now the hamiltonian is manifestly invariant under translations , and we can bloch - diagonalize it using the bloch basis states defined in , with the same set of allowed wave vectors @xmath124 as for the usual periodic boundary conditions .",
    "exact diagonalization can be performed in any gauge , but we chose to do it in the bond gauge , because in this gauge , the bloch basis states @xmath125 defined in can be used as is to block diagonalize the hamiltonian at all twist vectors @xmath120 .",
    "this gives us the ground - state wave function @xmath126 in the bond gauge .",
    "in the boundary gauge , or any other gauges , appropriate gauge transformations must be applied to @xmath127 before we can use this bloch basis to block diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "because of this , the computational cost for exact diagonalization incurred in the bond gauge is fractionally lower than in other gauges .",
    "we can also calculate the correlation functions @xmath128 ( of which the cluster dm is a function of ) in any gauge , with appropriately - defined covariant observables @xmath129 , where @xmath130 are the ` physical ' observables we would use when there is no twist in the boundary conditions . in the boundary gauge , these covariant observables @xmath131 and @xmath132 are particularly simple , except when the displacement vector @xmath133 crosses the boundaries of our system . for our purpose of calculating the cluster",
    "dm , this situation occurs only when the cluster itself straddle the system boundaries .",
    "therefore , with the cluster properly nested within the system , we chose to perform twist boundary conditions averaging in the boundary gauge .",
    "in the boundary gauge , the cluster dm is obtained by tracing down the ground - state wave function @xmath134 .",
    "we can get this wave function from @xmath126 by applying the gauge transformation @xmath135 where @xmath136 is an occupation number basis state , with occupation @xmath137 on site @xmath92 .",
    "now , averaging over twist vectors @xmath120 is the same as integrating over the brillouin zone , so we perform twist boundary conditions averaging over a uniform grid of monkhorst - pack points with order @xmath138.@xcite for rectangular systems @xmath139 , the first brillouin zone is sampled by varying the two independent twist angles between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "for non - square systems , the two independent twist angles @xmath142 and @xmath143 are defined by @xmath144 the twist vector @xmath120 is then related to the independent twist angles @xmath145 and @xmath146 by @xmath147 where @xmath148 are the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors of our non - square system . for such systems ,",
    "the first brillouin zone is a parallelogram on the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane , so the uniform grid of monkhorst - pack points are imposed on the square domain @xmath151 on the @xmath142-@xmath143 plane instead .",
    "the point symmetry group of the square lattice is the dihedral group @xmath152 , which has eight elements.@xcite the five irreducible representations of this group are @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath17 . for the cross - shaped cluster shown in fig.[fig : cross ]",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between these five irreducible representations and the one - particle states , but instead of labeling these one - particle states as @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , we adopt an angular momentum - like notation , @xmath162 that would make clear the structure of these one - particle states . we find it more convenient to work with the one - particle states @xmath163        for a cluster dm possessing the full point group symmetry of the square lattice , the one - particle state @xmath164 is constrained by symmetry to always be an eigenstate of @xmath11 .",
    "we call the associated eigenvalue @xmath165 the _ weight _ of @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore , the one - particle states @xmath166 and @xmath167 are also equivalent under the square lattice symmetry , and hence their weights @xmath168 and @xmath169 are equal .",
    "we call this doubly - degenerate one - particle weight @xmath170 . on the other hand , the @xmath171 one - particle eigenstates of @xmath11 are in general not @xmath172 , @xmath173 or @xmath174 , @xmath175 , but some admixture of the form @xmath176 we call their corresponding weights @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively",
    ".    we can then extend this angular - momentum - like notation to multi - particle states of the cluster .",
    "though the quantum numbers used to label the one - particle states are , strictly speaking , not angular momentum quantum numbers , we apply the rules of angular momenta addition as if they were to write down the angular - momentum - like quantum numbers for the multi - particle states .",
    "for example , for the two - particle states of the cluster , we have @xmath179",
    "in preparation for our main calculations on the strongly - interacting system , we investigated in great details the cluster dm spectra of a system of noninteracting spinless fermions described by the hamiltonian @xmath180 an analytical formula for the cluster dm @xmath11 is known for this system,@xcite using which we can obtain the spectrum of @xmath11 for any system size .",
    "we take advantage of this analytical formula to calculate @xmath11 for an infinite system of noninteracting spinless fermions .",
    "however , our goal in calculating the cluster dm spectrum of noninteracting spinless fermions is to compare it against the cluster dm spectrum of interacting spinless fermions . for the latter system",
    ", we can only calculate  sans approximations  the cluster dm from the exactly - diagonalized ground - state wave function of finite systems . to make this comparison between noninteracting and interacting spinless fermions more meaningful , we compute their cluster dms for the same series of finite systems . in section [",
    "sect : nicdm ] , we describe how the infinite - system and finite - system cluster dms for noninteracting spinless fermions are calculated .",
    "in section  [ sect : nifse ] , we observe that the noninteracting finite - system cluster dm spectra are contaminated by various finite - size effects .",
    "these finite - size effects also arise when we compute the interacting finite - system cluster dm spectra , so we want to learn how to deal with them .",
    "clearly , the effectiveness of various techniques in reducing finite - size effects can be best gauged by applying them to finite systems of noninteracting spinless fermions , since we will then be able to compare the results from the various techniques against the infinite - system limit .",
    "the simplest antidote to the various finite - size effects is to use a larger finite system .",
    "as expected , finite - size effects do become less and less important as the size of the system is increased .",
    "unfortunately , based on comparisons of the finite - system cluster dm spectra with the infinite - system cluster dm spectrum , we realized that we would need to go to system sizes of a few hundred sites in order for the finite - system cluster dm spectra to be decent approximations of the infinite - system cluster dm spectrum .",
    "since such system sizes are not practical for exactly diagonalizing the strongly - interacting system given by , we look into the method of twist boundary conditions averaging in section  [ sect : tbca ] .",
    "this method involves averaging the cluster dm spectra over various phase twists introduced into the periodic boundary conditions imposed on a given finite system . for noninteracting spinless fermions , we find that twist boundary conditions averaging reduces finite domain and shell effects in the cluster dm spectra , which then approximate the infinite - system cluster dm very well . as a matter of standardization ,",
    "we apply the method of twist boundary conditions averaging to both noninteracting and interacting spinless fermions , and compare their twist boundary conditions - averaged cluster dm spectra .      instead of the general formalism presented in section  [ sect : cdmf ] ,",
    "for the system of noninteracting spinless fermions we calculate the cluster dm weights using the exact formula @xmath181_{ij } { { c_{i}^{\\dagger}}}{{c_{j}^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}}}\\biggr\\}\\ ] ] obtained in ref . , which relates the dm @xmath11 of a cluster of sites and the cluster green - function matrix @xmath80 .",

    ", we find that it is impossible to say anything meaningful about the dependence on the filling fraction @xmath212 for the cluster dm weights because of the finite size effects .",
    "using the relation for noninteracting systems , we investigated the effect of system size on the spectrum of @xmath11 for a series of system @xmath215 , @xmath216 , with the same shape .",
    "as the system size is increased , we find that the cluster dm spectrum approaches the infinite - system limit , as shown in figure [ fig : free0n1 ] .    for this series of systems ,",
    "the infinite - system limit is more or less reached at around @xmath217 ( 272 sites ) , based on comparison with the infinite - system limit itself .",
    "we can also arrive at this estimate by looking at the convergence of the one - particle weights alone .",
    "more importantly , we find that the shell effect affects weights of different symmetry differently : @xmath177 is almost unaffected , while @xmath165 is the most severely affected .",
    "shell effect persists in @xmath165 even up to a system size of 1088 sites ( for @xmath218 ) .",
    "( ) and @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) systems have the same shape but different sizes .",
    "the solid curves are the zero- and one - particle weights for the infinite system . for @xmath177 , we see the finite domain effect deviations for the @xmath221 system is practically gone by the time we get to the @xmath219 system . for the rest of the one - particle weights ,",
    "the finite domain effect is largely removed in the @xmath219 system , but shell effect persists .",
    "in fact , shell effect in @xmath165 is still visible when we go to the @xmath222 system ( not shown ) , which has @xmath223 sites . ]",
    "we also looked at @xmath224 , which is almost unaffected by shell effect , for several systems with between 200 to 300 sites of different shapes . for systems of these sizes ,",
    "the finite domain effect is negligible , but we find @xmath224 from finite systems of different shapes differing very slightly from the infinite - system limit , and also from each other . since we expect systems of different shapes to all approach the same infinite - system limit , we attribute these very small deviations to the shape effect . based on more extensive numerical studies ( see chapter 4 of ref . )",
    "not reported in this paper , we know that shape effect deviations are not effectively removed by the three averaging devices we have introduced in section  [ sect : averaging ] , but fortunately these deviations are very small .      for a system of interacting spinless fermions , we can not directly compute the exact infinite - system cluster dm .",
    "we can , however , choose to work with ( i ) an approximate ground - state wave function of an infinite system , or ( ii ) the exact ground - state wave function of a finite system , or ( iii ) an approximate ground - state wave function of a finite system .",
    "as reported in section [ sect : strong ] , we chose option ( ii ) , where the exact ground - state wave function is obtained through numerical exact diagonalization",
    ".    exact diagonalization severely limits the sizes of the finite systems we can work with ( see appendix of ref .   for formula on size of hilbert space for the strongly - interacting model given by ) . with aggressive memory reduction measures ,",
    "it is possible ( but not necessarily feasible ) to exactly diagonlize finite systems with up to 30 sites for all filling fractions .",
    "however , as we have illustrated in section [ sect : nifse ] , for systems so small , the numerical cluster dm spectra would be plagued by strong finite size effects , most notably by the shell effect .",
    "this is where twist boundary conditions averaging comes in .    very crudely speaking",
    ", we can think of averaging numerical observables over @xmath225 twist boundary conditions for a finite system with @xmath18 sites as being equivalent to computing these numerical observables for a single finite system of @xmath226 sites , subject to only periodic boundary conditions . in the best - case scenario",
    ", the effective system size @xmath227 might be as large as @xmath228 , though @xmath227 will typically grow slower than @xmath229 .",
    "the computational cost of performing exact diagonalization for a system with @xmath18 sites over @xmath225 twist boundary conditions is on the order of @xmath230 , whereas the computational cost of performing exact diagonalization just once for a system with @xmath226 sites is @xmath231 .",

    "nevertheless , the averaged cluster dm weights from different finite systems with different number of particles are sufficiently consistent with each other that we can plot a smooth curve interpolating the averaged cluster dm weights .",
    "as explained in section  [ sect : intro ] , our interest in studying the strongly - interacting model of spinless fermions with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion is to understand how the cluster dm evolves with filling , given that we expect in this model crossovers between regimes of qualitatively different states .",

    "( ) , @xmath255 ( ) , @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) , @xmath239 ( @xmath220 ) , @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) and @xmath256 ( @xmath249 ) systems of strongly - interacting spinless fermions subject to twist boundary conditions averaging , using @xmath257 monkhorst - pack special - point integration . at @xmath258 and @xmath259 ,",
    "we know analytically that @xmath260 and @xmath261 respectively , and the solid ` curve ' interpolates between these two known limits and the equally weighted data points at finite filling fractions @xmath262 . also shown as the dashed curve is the zero - particle weight of the infinite system of noninteracting spinless fermions . ]      in our operator - based dm truncation scheme developed in ref .   for a noninteracting system ,",
    "the one - particle cluster dm weights play a very important role , since we select which one - particle operators to keep or discard based on the negative logarithm of these numbers .",
    "we expect the one - particle cluster dm weights , though not entirely sufficient by themselves , would also play an important role in defining an operator - based truncation scheme .",
    "therefore , in this section , we present results for a series of calculations to determine the infinite - system limit of the one - particle cluster dm spectra for our strongly - interacting system as a function of filling fraction @xmath2 , and discuss their implications for an operator - based dm truncation scheme .",
    "though we really do need to worry about the evolution of the structure of @xmath263 and @xmath264 as a function of @xmath2 in both the noninteracting and strongly - interacting systems , the one - particle weights are ordered by their magnitudes as @xmath265 for both systems .",
    "but while the noninteracting one - particle weights go down by roughly one order of magnitude as we go through the sequence @xmath266 , we see from fig.[fig : w1stronginterpolate ] that the interacting one - particle weights decay more slowly along this same sequence .",
    "we studied the finite @xmath267 ( ) , @xmath243 ( ) , @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) , @xmath239 ( @xmath220 ) , @xmath246 ( @xmath247 ) and @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) systems subject to twist boundary conditions averaging , using @xmath257 monkhorst - pack special - point integration . at a filling fraction of @xmath258 ,",
    "the system approaches the noninteracting limit , and thus all the one - particle weights are zero . at half - filling @xmath259 ,",
    "the two - fold degenerate checker - board ground state is unaffected by twist boundary conditions averaging .",
    "we can thus perform degeneracy averaging analytically , to find that @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",

    "when only periodic boundary conditions are imposed , there is significantly more ` scatter ' in the one - particle weights as a function of filling fraction @xmath2 , for interacting systems of different sizes , than for noninteracting systems of different sizes . averaging the one - particle weights of the interacting systems over various twist",
    "boundary conditions visibly reduces this ` scatter ' , even though the remnant ` scatter ' seen in figure [ fig : w1stronginterpolate ] is still rather large , compared to case for the noninteracting system ( figure [ fig : free1diffsys ] ) . from our own detailed study of the method of twist boundary conditions averaging for noninteracting systems,@xcite we know that twist boundary conditions averaging effectively removes finite size effects from some observables , but not for others .",
    "we have no reason to expect twist boundary conditions averaging to apply equally effectively over the same set of observables , when we go from noninteracting systems to interacting systems .",
    "conversely , observables for which twist boundary conditions averaging is ineffective in noninteracting systems , might be effectively twist - boundary - conditions - averaged in interacting systems . with only input from the exact diagonalization of finite systems , and without employing system - size extrapolations , the method of twist boundary conditions averaging offers us the best hope of gaining insight into the infinite - system properties we seek .",
    "we expect that the remnant ` scatter ' in the twist - boundary - conditions - averaged one - particle weights will be reduced , if we had not made the nearest - neighbor repulsion infinite .",
    "there are two reasons why we did not also study the case of @xmath271 .",
    "first , for a fixed system size @xmath18 and particle number @xmath36 , the hilbert space for the @xmath7 system would be much larger than that of the @xmath6 system . a parallel study for @xmath7 of the @xmath6 system sizes and particle numbers reported in this paper , with twist boundary conditions averaging , will require unacceptably long total computation time .",
    "second , and more importantly , we believe that as long as @xmath272 is large , the qualitative implications on the operator - based dm truncation scheme would be similar to the case where @xmath273 , and therefore it suffices to examine the latter case , which is computationally much more manageable . in any case , we do not believe the remnant ` scatter ' in the twist - boundary - conditions - averaged dm weights will hamper our efforts in drawing qualitative conclusions regarding the applicability , or otherwise , of the operator - based dm truncation scheme for interacting fermi liquids .    in the operator - based dm truncation scheme described in ref .",
    ", we discard one - particle cluster dm eigenstates with very small weights , and keep only the many - particle cluster dm eigenstates built from the retained one - particle eigenstates .",
    "the sum of weights of the truncated set of cluster dm eigenstates will then be very nearly one , _ if _ the discarded one - particle weights are all very small compared to the maximum one - particle weight .",
    "as we can see from fig.[fig : w1stronginterpolate ] , the ratio of the largest one - particle weight , @xmath177 , to the smallest one - particle weight , @xmath178 , is not large enough for us to justify keeping @xmath263 and discarding @xmath264 , except when the system is very close to half - filled .",
    "we believe that the one - particle cluster dm weights are so close to each other in magnitude , because of the net ` strength ' of interactions straddling the cluster and its environment is strong compared to the net ` strength ' of interactions strictly within the cluster . unfortunately for our five - site cluster , which was chosen because it is the smallest non - trivial cluster having the full point group symmetry of the underlying square lattice , cluster is the smallest cluster having @xmath152 as its point symmetry group .",
    "however , it is trivial as a cluster , because we can have at most @xmath274 particles within this cluster , as opposed to a maximum of @xmath275 particles within the five - site cluster . ]",
    "the sites within the cluster are poorly connected , i.e. a cluster site is on average connected to more environmental sites than to other cluster sites .",
    "to have more of the total interactions of the cluster with the system be confined within the cluster , a cluster significantly larger than the five - site cluster studied in this paper will be needed .",
    "this large cluster must then be embedded in a finite system that is larger still , making exact diagonalization studies unfeasible .",
    "while it is desirable to have a broader distribution of one - particle weights , our more important task is to examine how closely the many - particle cluster dm eigenstates can be approximated as products of one - particle cluster dm eigenstates .",
    "in particular , we look at the two - particle cluster dm eigenstates , and find that of the two - particle states listed in , the only states which are allowed by the no - nearest - neighbor constraint to appear in the cluster hilbert space are @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "we know therefore that the two - particle sector of @xmath11 comprises a @xmath280 @xmath281-diagonal block ( with weight @xmath282 ) , a @xmath280 @xmath283-diagonal block ( with weight @xmath284 ) , and two degenerate @xmath285 @xmath36-diagonal blocks ( with weights @xmath286 and @xmath287 ) .",
    "the two - particle weights are shown as a function of filling @xmath2 in fig.[fig : w2strong ] .",

    "[ fig : w2strong ] , the solid ` curves ' interpolates between these two known limits and the equally weighted data points at finite filling fractions @xmath262 .",
    "we realized that there are significantly fewer nontrivial two - particle eigenstates of @xmath11 than predicted from the combination of one - particle eigenstates .",
    "from the point of view of implementing the operator - based dm truncation scheme , this poses no problem _ if _ the non - occurring two - particle states are predicted to have small enough weights that they will be excluded by the truncation scheme .",
    "however , we find that this is not the case .",
    "for example , the two - particle state @xmath288 , which does not occur , is predicted by simple combination of the one - particle states @xmath174 and @xmath289 to have a weight comparable to that of the two - particle state @xmath276 , which does occur .    of the two - particle weights that are allowed by the no - nearest - neighbor constraint",
    ", we expect their weights to follow the sequence @xmath290 , if they can indeed to thought of products of one - particle states . from fig.[fig : w2strong ] , we indeed observe this sequence of two - particle weights , even though their actual magnitudes ( calculated as the product of one - particle weights divided by the zero - particle weight ) do not come out right .",
    "this observation is encouraging , because we might yet be able to push a variant of the operator - based dm truncation scheme through , by introducing constraints on how many - particle cluster dm states can be built up from one - particle cluster dm states .      over broad ranges of filling fractions , the ground state of our strongly - interacting model of spinless fermions",
    "is expected to be an interacting fermi liquid .",
    "while we understand the cluster dm structure of a noninteracting fermi liquid completely , we do not yet understand how an interacting fermi liquid will manifest itself in the structure of its cluster dm .",
    "unlike a noninteracting fermi liquid , the ground - state dm of an interacting fermi liquid will not simply be the exponential of a noninteracting pseudo - hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the interacting pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath291 appearing in the interacting fermi - liquid ground - state dm @xmath292 can be made to look like the sum of a noninteracting pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath293 , and a much weaker interaction term @xmath294 , by a canonical transformation . from landau s fermi liquid theory ,",
    "we know that such a canonical transformation ( similar to the one which relates landau quasi - particles to bare fermions ) works by burying much of the bare interactions within the quasi - particles .    in tracing down the ground - state dm , our hope then is that the cluster dm can also be written , after a canonical transformation local to the cluster , as the exponential of the sum of a noninteracting pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath295 ( which is perhaps related to @xmath293 in the same way as for the noninteracting fermi liquid ) , and a weak interaction term @xmath296 .",
    "we suspect that the criterion for this to be possible is that we must be able to construct approximate quasi - particles using _ only _ cluster states to absorb the bare interactions .",
    "however , we also believe that the requirement that the canonical transformation act strictly within the cluster will fail to completely incorporate interactions that straddle the cluster and its environment .",
    "in section [ sect : strongtwo ] , we found that for our strongly - interacting system , the two - particle cluster dm eigenstates look nothing like simple products of two one - particle cluster dm eigenstates each .",
    "in fact , many combinations of two one - particle cluster dm eigenstates give invalid two - particle cluster states that violate the condition of no - nearest - neighbor occupation .",
    "it is tempting , based on this observation , to say then that the cluster dm is not the exponential of an approximately noninteracting pseudo - hamiltonian .",
    "however , it must be remembered that in an interacting fermi liquid , the quasi - particles are also not single bare particles .",
    "instead , they are superpositions of states containing different number of bare particles , which leads us to think of a quasi - particle as a bare particle being screened by other bare particles in its vicinity .    with this in mind , we realized that to identify the quasi - particle structure of the cluster dm , we need to construct appropriate linear combinations of the @xmath36-particle cluster dm eigenstates , so that the cluster dm , when written in terms of these ` quasi - particles ' , look like the exponential of a noninteracting pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath297 plus a weak interaction term @xmath298 .",
    "this involves writing the pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath299 as a sum of terms , representing the independent quantum fluctuations associated with each of the quasiparticles .",
    "this can be accomplished by defining an operator singular value decomposition of the cluster dm with respect to an appropriate operator norm , which forms the basis for judging whether the quantum fluctuations associated with two linear combination of bare operators are independent .",
    "details of such an operator singular value decomposition will be reported in a future paper.@xcite",
    "to summarize , we have calculated numerically the cluster dm for a cross - shaped cluster of five sites within both a system of noninteracting spinless fermions described by the hamiltonian , and a system of strongly - interacting spinless fermions described by the hamiltonian . for the noninteracting system",

    "dm spectra were carried out . when combined , these two averaging apparatus has the effect of restoring full square - lattice symmetry to the cluster dm .",
    "we also analyzed in detail the finite size effects not removed by degeneracy and orientation averaging , by inspecting the numerical cluster dm spectra coming from finite noninteracting systems of various sizes . by increasing the system size systematically",
    ", we find visually that the infinite - system limit of the cluster dm is ` attained ' when the system size reaches a couple of hundred sites .",
    "noting that these are forbiddingly large system sizes to work with for interacting systems , where the ground - state wave functions have to be obtained via exact diagonalization , we then tested the apparatus of twist boundary conditions averaging on finite systems with between 10 and 20 sites . for noninteracting spinless fermions , we find that the twist boundary conditions - averaged cluster dm weights for different finite systems and different filling fractions indeed fall close to the various infinite - system limits .",
    "since we do not perform system - size extrapolations , we interpolate between the degeneracy- , orientation- , and twist boundary conditions - averaged cluster dm weights for the various finite interacting systems and their respective accessible filling fractions , and take the result curves to be our best approximation of the cluster dm spectrum of the infinite interacting system .    comparing the twist boundary conditions - averaged cluster dm spectra for the noninteracting and strongly - interacting systems ,",
    "we find similar qualitative behavior in the zero - particle weights as functions of filling fraction , and qualitatively different behaviours in the one - particle weights as functions of filling fraction .",
    "however , the relative ordering @xmath265 is the same at all @xmath300 for both systems .",
    "quantitatively , we find for noninteracting spinless fermions that the one - particle weights go down by roughly one order of magnitude each time as we go through the sequence @xmath301 . for strongly - interacting spinless fermions ,",
    "the one - particle weights decay much more slowly along the sequence .    the implications",
    "this observation have for the operator - base dm truncation scheme developed in ref .",
    "is that , for a small fixed fraction of one - particle eigenstates retained , the total cluster dm weight of eigenstates retained would be much smaller for the strongly - interacting system compared to the noninteracting system , since the ratio of the smallest to the largest one - particle weights , @xmath302 , is not very much smaller than one .",
    "this narrow distribution of one - particle cluster dm weights aside , we observed that the relative ordering @xmath303 of the two - particle cluster dm weights , predicted based on the combination of one - particle cluster dm weights , is confirmed numerically  even though the predicted weights are off .",
    "this suggests that we might be able to push a variant of the naive operator - based dm truncation scheme through , by introducing additional rules on how one - particle cluster dm eigenstates can be combined to give only the valid many - particle cluster dm eigenstates .",
    "we did not attempt to implement such a truncation scheme , and test how badly its numerical accuracy is affected by the ratio @xmath302 ( by calculating the dispersion relation , for example , as was done in ref .  ) , because we feel that such a naive scheme was not in the spirit of finding an appropriate ` quasi - particle ' description for the low - energy excitations of our system of interacting spinless fermions given by .",
    "finally , we realized that our numerical studies do not allow us to conclude whether the cluster dm of the interacting system furnishes a good ` quasi - particle ' description for the strongly - interacting system . to be able to check this",

    "the lengths of these index vectors vary , but are of @xmath315 .",

    "we then search through the cluster and environment hilbert spaces to determine what the indices of @xmath68 and @xmath75 are in their respective hilbert spaces , which incurs a computational effort on the order of @xmath319 and @xmath320 respectively .",

    "this trace - down stage incurs a computational cost of @xmath324 .",
    "overall , the computational cost is on the order of @xmath325 .    for models allowing nearest - neighbor occupation",
    ", the system hilbert space is the direct product of the cluster hilbert space and the environment hilbert space , i.e.  @xmath326 .",
    "since the number @xmath36 of particles is small in any reasonable exact diagonalization , we can treat it as a @xmath327 constant . for small clusters , the size @xmath311 of the cluster hilbert space",
    "will also be small , so that the size @xmath323 of the environment hilbert space will be comparable in magnitude to @xmath283 . with these considerations ,",
    "we find that the computational cost for the naive algorithm is @xmath328 , while the computational cost for the inner - product algorithm with pre - sorting is @xmath329 . the efficiency of the two algorithms therefore depend on the prefactors , the estimation of which requires more thorough analyses of the two algorithms .    for a model such as , where nearest - neighbor occupation is forbidden , the system hilbert space is smaller than the direct product of the cluster hilbert space and the environment hilbert space , i.e.  @xmath330 . given again that @xmath36 and @xmath311 are small numbers ,",
    "the computational cost for the two algorithms are essentially determined by the ratio @xmath331 .",
    "this ratio is strongly dependent on the dimensionality of the problem : the superfluous configurations generated by the direct product of the cluster hilbert space and the environment hilbert space are invalid because they contain nearest - neighbor sites , right at the boundary between the cluster and its environment , which are occupied . in one dimension , the number of superfluous configurations is small , because the boundary between the cluster and its environment consists only of two bonds , whatever the size @xmath3 of the cluster . in two dimensions ,",

    "<S> the reduced density matrix of an interacting system can be used as the basis for a truncation scheme , or in an unbiased method to discover the strongest kind of correlation in the ground state . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the structure of the many - body fermion density matrix of a small cluster in a square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster density matrix is evaluated numerically over a set of finite systems , subject to non - square periodic boundary conditions given by the lattice vectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we then approximate the infinite - system cluster density - matrix spectrum , by averaging the finite - system cluster density matrix ( i ) over degeneracies in the ground state , and orientations of the system relative to the cluster , to ensure it has the proper point - group symmetry ; and ( ii ) over various twist boundary conditions to reduce finite size effects . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the eigenvalue structure of the averaged cluster density matrix for noninteracting and strongly - interacting spinless fermions , as a function of the filling fraction @xmath2 , and discuss whether it can be approximated as being built up from a truncated set of single - particle operators . </S>"
