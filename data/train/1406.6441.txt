    "all known human societies have displayed some level of economic inequality @xcite . yet this global imbalance is reaching alarming levels in the contemporary world : as of 2013 , the 400 richest americans have more wealth than the bottom half of all americans combined . indeed recent comprehensive research @xcite has showed that , while they have not reached the highs of the pre-1929 period , wealth inequalities in developed countries have steadily increased in the past decades .",
    "understanding the origins and implications of these inequalities is an outstanding problem for economics , but also for society as a whole .    on the theory side , a well - established approach to this problem",
    " pursued independently by economists @xcite , mathematicians @xcite , sociologists @xcite and physicists @xcite  consists in studying the equilibrium wealth distribution in stochastic models of individual ( or household ) income . under general assumptions , one shows that additive income lead to exponential distributions , while multiplicative capital returns yield pareto - like power law distributions @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with empirical data , both contemporary @xcite and historical @xcite , which reveal a two - class structure with an exponential range at low wealth ( where investment is negligible ) and a power - law tail at high capital ( where income is dominated by investment returns ) .",
    "econophysicists @xcite have pointed the striking similarity between this pattern and the boltzmann - gibbs distribution of statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed both have the same  entropic \" structure : there are many more ways to distribute a conserved quantity ( be it wealth or energy ) unequally than equally .",
    "one much discussed consequence of such marked economic inequalities is the emergence of a super - elite class , the so - called ",

    "but they also have more global effects , one of which is increased _ stratification _ @xcite  the growth of the number of economically distinct  classes \" in society . indeed , as we will see below ,",
    " maximum entropy \" wealth distributions are precisely those with the greatest stratification under global constraints on the mean wealth .",
    "this intriguing analogy between entropy and stratification points to a connection between the dynamics of inequalities and dissipation in thermal systems , extending beyond the limits of equilibrium statistical mechanics ( to which it has been restricted so far ) .",
    "in this paper we introduce a general framework , inspired from stochastic thermodynamics @xcite , to account for the dynamical origin of social inequalities . at its foundation",
    "is a general property of markov processes known as the _ _ fluctuation theorem _ _ ( appendix [ ft ] ) . as we shall see",
    ", the great strength of this theorem lies in its _ explanatory power _ : given an entropy - increasing stochastic process , the fluctuation theorem elucidates the _ mechanism _ driving entropy production . in the context of social inequalities , where entropy quantifies inequality ,",
    "we find that , over and above the multiplicative effect of capital return , _ precarious social mobility _ acts as a universal inequality - generating mechanism .",

    "the fact that the gini index is maximized by such a singular distribution makes it rather unnatural in the context of large populations with smooth , unimodal distributions .",
