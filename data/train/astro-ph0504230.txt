    "wood & churchwell ( 1989a ; hereafter wc89 ) published the first survey of a new class of radio continuum sources in the galaxy called ultracompact ( uc ) hii regions .",
    "these sources represent a subset of `` standard '' hii regions characterized by unusually small sizes ( @xmath00.01  pc ) and high emission measures ( @xmath110@xmath2  pc  @xmath3 ) , as derived from high angular resolution imaging observations with the very large array ( vla ) at 6 and 2 centimeters . wc89",
    "systematically tabulated the physical properties of 75 sources found in regions at a variety of distances and placed them in five distinct morphological classes : cometary , shell , irregular , core - halo , and spherical / unresolved .",
    "the percentages of uc  hii region morphologies found in this survey were 4% shell , 20% cometary , and the remainder ( 76% ) irregular , spherical / unresolved and core - halo sources .",
    "a subsequent survey of 59 additional regions by kurtz et al .",
    "( 1994 ; hereafter k94 ) extended these results and detected 75 more uc  hii regions with a similar distribution of morphologies .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) estimate the lifetime of an uc  hii region ( @xmath410@xmath5 yr ) from the comparison between the number of o stars within 2.5 kpc of the sun ( 436 ; conti et al .",
    "1983 ) and the number of the 1646 embedded ob star candidates from the iras sample that one would expect to find within 2.5 kpc of the sun if the sources were uniformly distributed in the galactic disk ( 45 ) . from this comparison",
    ", they determine that 10%-20% of the lifetime of an o star is spent in the uc  hii region phase , in agreement with the estimate by mezger & smith ( 1975 ) that between 15% and 25% of all o stars are hidden by dust .",
    "following the arguments of wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) , if there are approximately 1700 embedded ob star candidates in the galactic disk , the surveys of wood & churchwell ( wc89 ) , kurtz et al ( 1994 ) and the current work sample approximately 20% of the embedded ob stars in the galactic disk .    in recent years , we have used the vla to study radio continuum and radio recombination line emission from two of the galaxy s most luminous regions of massive star formation , sgr b2 and w49a .",
    "other luminous massive star forming regions include the arches , the galactic center cluster , and ngc 3603 .",
    "the observations of these `` target rich '' regions , with resolutions from @xmath42  to 004 ( @xmath40.1 to 0.002  pc ) , have identified nearly 100 additional uc  hii regions .",
    "the imaging observations of this new sample motivate a modification to the uc  hii region morphological classification scheme of wc89 . in particular , we suggest removal of the `` core - halo '' morphology , and we add a new `` bipolar '' designation . in this _ letter _ , we describe these modifications to the classification scheme , the criteria used in the classification process , and we discuss the uc  hii region morphologies found in sgr b2 and w49a .",
    "our vla radio continuum and recombination line observations of sgr b2 and w49a have been presented and analyzed in a series of previous papers : 7  mm and 1.3  cm observations of sgr b2 are discussed in de pree et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) , and gaume et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; 7  mm , 1.3  cm , and 3.6  cm observations of w49a are discussed in de pree et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2000 ) and wilner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; further details of the high resolution line and continuum imaging of sgr b2 and w49a are given in de pree et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and de pree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the vla observations of these two massive star forming regions have provided a large sample of uc  hii regions suitable for morphological study .",
    "the sample has the following characteristics : ( 1 ) a total number of sources of 97 , comparable to the wc89 and k94 surveys , ( 2 ) sensitivity to radio continuum structures on a wide range of size scales , ( 3 ) good emission measure sensitivity , resulting from long integration times on a large number of sources within just two fields of view , and ( 4 ) unambiguous relative size measurements within each of the two regions , as the sources within each region are associated and at the same distance .",
    "we classified the morphologies of each of the uc  hii regions detected in w49a and sgr b2 using the highest angular resolution images available .",
    "most of the sources can be placed in one of the morphological classes defined by wc89 , but characteristics of the data prompts us to modify the wc89 classification scheme in three ways :    _ a new bipolar morphology : _ there is a significant population of sources that exhibit a regular , previously uncategorized , morphology , elongated along one axis .",
    "churchwell ( 2002 ) , in his recent review of uc  hii regions , refers to a `` bipolar '' morphology , and we adopt that term here . the addition of the bipolar morphology is clearly needed to accommodate the presence of this class of sources .",
    "_ elimination of core - halo morphology : _ with multi - configuration vla observations that are sensitive to emission at large size scales , it is apparent that many of the uc  hii regions in sgr b2 and w49a are associated with a faint shelf of radio emission ( e.g. see 3.6 cm images of w49a ; de pree et al .",
    "recent studies of other , more isolated , radio continuum sources in star forming regions indicate that essentially all uc  hii regions are associated with large scale , diffuse emission , when observed with sufficient sensitivity ( kim & koo 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , the `` core - halo '' designation is not a useful morphological discriminant in modern data sets of high quality .",
    "instead , we prefer to concentrate on the morphology of the compact source within the extended emission .",
    "_ rename `` shell '' morphology to `` shell - like '' : _ many of the shell - like sources show considerable clumpiness and departures from circular symmetry in their brightness , while retaining a clearly identifiable and approximately circular edge - brightened structure . a slight revision in nomenclature to shell - like ( sl )",
    "offers a better description of this morphology .    in summary , the revised uc  hii region",
    "morphological types are : ( 1 ) shell - like ( sl ) , ( 2 ) bipolar , ( 3 ) cometary , ( 4 ) spherical , ( 5 ) irregular , and ( 6 ) unresolved .",
    "the definitions of these morphologies ( abbreviations in parenthesis ) are :    * shell - like ( sl ) : roughly circular sources that are not centrally peaked and are more than 50% complete around their perimeter , with no evidence of elongation away from the brightened edge .",
    "figure 1a shows the sl source w49a / d . *",
    "bipolar ( b ) : sources with an axial ratio of at least 2:1 .",
    "if radio recombination line data are available , then there may be evidence of a velocity gradient along the long axis .",
    "figure 1b shows the bipolar source w49a / a1 . * cometary ( c ) : sources with a bright edge and a tail that extends at least 1.5 times the width of the face .",
    "figure 1c shows the cometary source sgr b2 main / i . *",
    "spherical ( s ) : sources that are symmetric , centrally brightened , resolved , and can be fit well by a two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "figure 1d shows the spherical source w49a / r .",
    "* irregular ( i ) : any spatially resolved source that does not fit in one of the specified categories .",
    "figure 1e shows the irregular source sgr b2 main / f2 * unresolved ( u ) : sources that are symmetrical , centrally brightened , and can be fit well by a two - dimensional gaussian that is comparable to the beam size .",
    "figure 1f shows the unresolved source w49a / a2      the newly recognized class of bipolar uc  hii regions is especially interesting .",
    "kinematic evidence from radio recombination lines suggest that the bipolar morphology may be associated with the bipolar outflow phase of early stellar evolution .",
    "several of the bipolar sources in w49a and sgr b2 show velocity gradients along their long axis , or they show remarkably broad line widths ( @xmath6v@xmath750 ) that are not the result of pressure broadening ( de pree et al .",
    "the motions of the ionized gas , together with the elongation along one axis , suggest that ionized gas is flowing away from the young massive star at highly supersonic velocities .",
    "in addition , garay et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have observed a collimated stellar wind emanating from iras 16547 - 4247 and conclude that the thermal jet phenomenon may be common for high - mass as well as for low - mass stars .",
    "table 1 lists the percentage of sources found in each morphological class for the sources in the surveys of wc89 , k94 , and in sgrb2 and w49 .",
    "as indicated in table 1 , we find that 28% are shell - like , 8% are bipolar , 14% are cometary , and the remainder(50% ) are spherical , irregular , or unresolved . in most respects ,",
    "the findings of the three surveys are compatible within the uncertainties , which are generally dominated by counting statistics ( and the subjective nature of the classification process ) .",
    "the frequencies of cometary , irregular and unresolved morphologies are compatible .",
    "k94 find a marginally higher percentage of spherical sources than in the wc89 survey or the w49a and sgr b2 sample .",
    "the bipolar morphology was not used by wc89 or k94 , and we do not use the core - halo morphology , thus we do not have percentages to compare for these two morphologies .    the only significant difference between the morphological classifications within sgr b2 and w49a and those of wc89 and k94 is the much higher percentage of sl sources ( 28% vs. 3% ) , about an order of magnitude more frequent occurrence of sources in this class .",
    "the rarity of shell - like sources in the earlier surveys is surprising , considering the results of existing hydrodynamical models .",
    "studies of the evolution of uc  hii regions that examine the expansion of photoionization and stellar wind bubbles in dense molecular gas suggest that shell - like morphologies should be common ( e.g. garcia - segura & franco 1996 ) .",
    "the vla observations of the sgr b2 and w49a regions indicate that sl is the most commonly observed morphology in these regions , comprising approximately one - third of the sources .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the striking difference in the percentage of shell sources found by wc89 , k94 , and in the current work .",
    "since the difference has clear statistical significance , it must result either from real physical differences in the populations of uc  hii regions sampled , or from selection effects related to differences in the observational strategies of the galactic survey work ( wc89 and k94 ) and the current work .",
    "the star forming environments represented by sgr b2 and w49a are extreme and present differences from the typical galactic plane star forming environment . since the wc and k94 surveys targeted isolated sources identified from _ iras _ 100 @xmath8 measurements , these surveys contained primarily isolated star forming regions , rather than highly clustered , high source density regions like sgr b2 and w49a .",
    "the difference in the percentage of shell - like sources could indicate that physical conditions in these highly clustered regions lead to a higher prevalence of this morphology .",
    "one possibile explanation for the larger numbers of regular shell - like morphologies is that the molecular environments into which the uc hii regions expand are smoother , with fewer fluctuations in ambient pressure due to density , temperature , or turbulence that lead to the development of substantial asymmetries in the expansion phase .    the observing strategies and goals of wc89 and k94 differed from the current work .",
    "the wc89 and k94 surveys were comprised of short `` snapshot '' observations that targeted a large number of relatively isolated regions at the expense of integration time on each region .",
    "the sgr b2 and w49a surveys , by contrast , consist of observations of just two ( crowded ) pointings , which allowed for substantially longer integration times , better fourier plane coverage , and higher sensitivity . given data with lower sensitivity , many of the sources identified in sgr b2 and w49a with sl morphology might have been classified as cometary or irregular .",
    "likewise , sources classified by wc89 and k94 as cometary and irregular might ( with better sensitivity and multiple vla configurations ) be classified as shell - like .",
    "fey et al . ( 1992 ) show several examples of such changes in uc  hii region morphological classification in light of data of higher quality and sensitivity to a broader range of spatial scales .",
    "we have classified the morphologies of nearly 100 uc  hii regions in the sgr b2 and w49a regions .",
    "these results , taken together with previous work , suggest modifications in the uc  hii region classification scheme , as follows :    1 .",
    "vla observations with sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales detect faint extended radio continuum emission throughout massive star forming regions , which makes nearly all compact sources appear with `` core - halo '' morphologies . as a result ,",
    "we drop the `` core - halo '' designation from the uc  hii region classification scheme .",
    "a small percentage of uc  hii regions have clear bipolar morphologies ; in cases where recombination line data are available , the kinematics suggest directed ionized outflows originating from a young central source .",
    "this new `` bipolar '' morphological class is more common in w49a and sgr b2 than the shell morphology was in the wc89 or k94 surveys .",
    "we suggest that the shell classification should be modified to `` shell - like '' ( or sl ) , in order to describe more accurately the appearance of these sources , many of which are clumpy or partially complete . the sgr b2 and w49a regions exhibit @xmath410 times as many sources with shell - like morphologies as found in the wc89 or k94 surveys .",
    "deep , multi - configuration vla observations of sources previously classified as cometary and irregular should determine whether this discrepancy is due to limitations of snapshot data .",
    "the next step in this study is to utilize the morphological findings and derived physical parameters of the sources and their environments as inputs and constraints in hydrodynamic models of uc  hii region evolution ."
