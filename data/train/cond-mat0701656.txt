    "double quantum dot ( dqd ) systems exhibit a wide range of interesting and fundamental physical phenomena , such as coulomb blockade oscillations of conductance @xcite , the formation of `` double quantum dot molecule '' @xcite or the kondo effect@xcite .",
    "experimentally , dqds have been formed in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite , in single wall carbon nanotubes@xcite and in inas nanowires@xcite . in recent years interest in dqds",
    "has also been driven by the quest for a solid - state based qubit , the elementary building block of a quantum computer . in the presence of an interdot coupling @xmath0 ,",
    "coherent electrons states can extend over the whole dqd system , resembling therefore the formation of chemical bonds in molecules .",
    "this interdot coupling @xmath0 controls the exchange interaction of electron spins , assumed to be localized in each of the dots , and hence eventually the operation of a corresponding solid - state qubit system@xcite as well .",
    "another interesting phenomenon , seen in experiments@xcite performed in coulomb blockade regime at high source - drain voltages is that the levels of one of the quantum dots ( qds ) can act as a low - temperature filter for the other qd .",
    "this means that on detuning the energies of the levels participating in the resonant tunnelling process , the width of the resonance peak in conductance is independent of the temperature .",
    "surprisingly , a complete analytic description of non - thermal broadening in not currently available , despite the fact that this effect is alluded to in the early work of ref .   and has been demonstrated numerically in ref .   for coherently coupled quantum dots at large source - drain voltages @xmath1 .",
    "a complete analytical theory of coherently coupled dots is desirable , since in all the above theories , the shape of the resonant peak is found to be lorentzian . experimentally non - lorentzian lineshapes are found , but these are attributed to inelastic scattering .",
    "it is therefore of interest to ask under what circumstances non - lorentzian peaks are found in the absence of inelastic scattering .    in this paper",
    "we consider a dqd system with coherent interdot coupling as well as with coherent couplings between the dots and leads .",
    "we assume that the charging energies of the dots are negligible or can be treated as constant shifts@xcite and therefore the system can be described by an effective single particle model .",
    "( for studies of the electronic correlations in dqds see refs .  . )",
    "we note that experimental results on dqd molecules are often explained with such simple effective single particle models@xcite , which usually assume that couplings of the dots to the leads can be neglected .",
    "we first show how the finite interdot and dot - lead couplings affect the lineshape of the zero bias conductance resonance .",
    "our results are non - perturbative and take into account all orders of interdot and dot - lead tunnel processes .",
    "we also consider the finite temperature conductance and present results for the temperature dependence of the peak height of the conductance resonance as well as its broadening .",
    "we show that in our model the non - thermal broadening effect in resonant transport can be observed even in the zero - bias limit , if the dot - lead coupling strength exceeds the interdot coupling @xmath0 .",

    "ii we introduce a very general description of coupled dots and derive the zero temperature transmission formula . in sec .",
