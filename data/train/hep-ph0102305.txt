    "it is generally accepted that the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite model offers a simple scheme to study the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "most calculations in this model have been based on the mean - field approximation , i.e. , quark self - energy in the leading order of @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , more interests are paid on the njl model beyond mean - field approximation .",
    "the mesonic fluctuations are variously investigated in the bosonization formalism @xcite-@xcite and in the feynman diagram formalism of @xmath0 expansion @xcite-@xcite . @xcite and @xcite in bosonization formalism using meson - loop expansion or saddle - point expanstion are equivalent to the self - consistent feynman diagram formalism @xcite in @xmath0 expansion , and the chiral symmetry of the njl model",
    "can be preserved . while , @xcite and @xcite generalize the njl model to the nonliear - sigma approach for description of chiral fluctuations , and the authors in @xcite claimed that at @xmath2 the njl model does not display spontaneous symmetry breaking dut to chiral fluctuations .",
    "there are two different @xmath0 expansion schemes which can preserve chiral symmetry of the njl model .",
    "one is the so - called `` strict '' @xmath0 expansion scheme through iterating the quark self - energy at hartree approximation @xcite @xcite .",
    "the other is the self - consistent scheme with meson - loop expansion or saddle - point expansion , in which the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions represent the mesonic quantum fluctuations around the classical stationary chiral symmetry breaking vacuum @xcite@xcite@xcite . in both schemes , the meson corrections to the mean - field approximation",
    "are included not only in the meson - loop contributions , but also in the one - quark - loop contributions through the corrected quark propagator .    in the above mentioned chiral symmetric schemes ,",
    "emphasis is put on discussing the nlo or pure meson - loop contributions . however , to investigate whether chiral symmetry is restored in the vacuum , one should investigate the meson corrections to the mean - field approximation . in this paper",
    "we investigate not only the mesonic fluctuations around the classical vacuum , but also the mesonic corrections to the mean - field approximation in the chiral symmetric self - consistent scheme based on @xcite , we will exactly calculate the meson polarization function and the quark self - energy to the next - to - leading order in @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we will show that , by using the pole approximation for internal meson propagators , the @xmath0 expansion in the self - consistent scheme is also `` strict '' .",
    "the momentum cut - off for quarks and mesons , i.e. , @xmath3 and @xmath1 , have been introduced in non - covariant three - momentum regularization .",
    "the model parameters at different values of @xmath1 have been determined by fitting the pion s mass @xmath4 and the pion s decay constant @xmath5 with an appropriate value of the current quark mass .",
    "the way to determine the parameters to the next - to - leading order here is different from that used in @xcite and @xcite , where the parameters are fitted at leading order @xcite or partialy at leading order @xcite .",

    "the corresponding quark mass is @xmath29 and chiral condensate @xmath30 .",
    "the chiral symmetric self - consistent scheme is described in details in @xcite @xcite in effective action formalism and in @xcite by using feynman diagramatic method .    including current quark mass @xmath9 ,",
    "the gap equation for quark mass can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of quark self - enery in @xmath0 expansion , which can be read directly from the feynman diagrams in fig.1 .",

    ", it is necessary to note that in @xcite , the nlo quark self - energy is seperated into two parts : the first term of meson propagator in rpa and the remaining ring diagrams .    evaluating quark loop and meson - loop integrals , one can get a simple relation between the quark condensate and the constituent quark mass @xmath34 , @xmath37    the magnitude of the mesonic quantum fluctuations around the classical vacuum is defined as the ratio of the pure nlo contributions over the lo contributions @xmath38 which had been discussed carefully in @xcite .",
    "and the mesonic corrections on the chiral condensate is defined as the difference between the value in and beyond mean - field approximation , i.e. @xmath39 and the ratio of mesonic corrections is @xmath40",
    "because the sigma meson is heavy , it does not play an important role in vacuum , and the nlo contributions would not affect the properties of sigma meson .",

    "the three model parameters @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 are determined varying with @xmath1 by fitting the pion mass @xmath4 and pion decay constant @xmath66 and taking an appropriate current quark mass @xmath27 .",
    "different from @xcite and @xcite , we did not use the leading order of the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gor ) relations @xmath67 as a constraint , because we did not use external moentum expansion for pions in our calculations .",
    "in addition , we did not use chiral expansion for pion mass and pion decay constant . as for the way to determine the model parameters in the calculations to the next - to - leading order",
    ", we do nt think it is self - consistent to fit the parameters at @xcite or partially at @xcite leading order .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig.2 and fig.3 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "it is noticed that our results always start at about @xmath69 .",
    "this is because for any value of @xmath1 , the solutions of @xmath34 satisfies the relation @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "2.a , the total ( solid circles ) and lo ( stars ) quark condensate , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are plotted as a function of @xmath73 , the value at @xmath74 corresponds to the mean - field aprroximation @xmath75 . in fig.2.b ,",

    "it is found that in the region @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , both the lo and total quark condensate and pion polarization function are smaller than their mean - field values , which is refelcted in the negative meson corrections . here",
    "the meson corrections reducing the mean - field quark condensate agree with the results in fig.7 of @xcite .",
    "the mesonic fluctuations , i.e. , the pure nlo contributions of the chiral condensate and pion polarization function can be characterized by the meson - momentum cut - off @xmath1 , larger @xmath1 results in larger meson - loop contibutions .",
    "the nlo contributions are very small till @xmath86 with @xmath87 , then increase fast .",
    "when @xmath88 , corresponding to @xmath89 , the mesonic fluctuations are larger than @xmath90 , which means that the @xmath0 expansion around the stationary classical vacuum could not be used any more in this case .",
    "this is reasonable for only scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons involved .",
    "it is noticed that the nlo contributions enhancing the lo quark condensate is the same as that in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the negative mesonic corrections of the chiral condensate and pion polarization function do not decrease monotonously with the increasing @xmath73 , they reach the minimum @xmath91 and @xmath92 at about @xmath93 with @xmath94 , then increase fast .",
    "the reason is that the meson corrections to the mean - field approximation include two parts : the pure meson - loop or nlo contributions and the deviation of the one - quark - loop from the mean - field calculation with the quark mass @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath95 , corresponding to @xmath96 , the pure meson - loop contributions are negative but very small , and the meson corrections come only from the change of quark mass in the one - quark - loop part . when @xmath97 , corresponding to @xmath98 , the pure meson - loop contributions are contrary to the contributions from the deviation of the one - quark - loop contributions . at about @xmath99 ,",
    "the two parts cancel to each other completely , and the meson corrections vanish .",
    "it is the suppresion from the lo contributions and the enhancement from the nlo contributions , that the quark condensate in fig.2 @xmath100 and the pion polarization function in fig.3 @xmath100 do not decrease continuously with increasing @xmath73 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors claim that chiral symmetry will restore in vacuum by quantum fluctuations .",
    "one reason to get this strange conclusion is the lack of meson - loop contribution in the calculations in @xcite .",
    "this is also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the cancellation between the nlo contributions and the deviation of one - quark - loop contributions from the mean - field approximation is not the same as the cancellation between the exchange term and the remaining ring diagrams in @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the meson - loop contributions to quark self - energy are seperated into two parts , the exchange diagram and the ring diagram .",
    "it is found that the two contributions are contrary , and the exchange term is dominant , which is very important to ensure that the nlo contribution is positive to the lo values .",
    "our cancellation is also not the same as the cancellation between the two nlo diagrams in @xcite , where the cancellation induces the nlo contribtions to lo are very small .",
    "the cancellation inside the nlo contributions in @xcite and @xcite can not reflect the convergence of the total mesonic corrections to the mean - field approximation , because the mesonic corrections is also included in the one - quark - loop diagram due to the change of quark mass .",
    "in conclusion , the magnitude of mesonic fluctuations and their corresponding corrections on chiral condensate and pion polarization function are investigated in a self - consistent scheme by exactly calculating the feynman diagrams to next - to - leading order of @xmath0 expansion .",
    "it is found that the magnitude of the mesonic fluctuations around the classical vacuum , i.e. , the pure meson - loop contributions , can be characterized by the meson - momentum cut - off @xmath1 , the larger @xmath1 , the larger mesonic fluctuations .",
    "the nlo contributions enhance the lo values at the stationary saddle - point",
    ". however , the lo contributions reduce the values in the mean - field approximation . the two contributions to the mean - field approximation are contrary and cancel to each other .    when @xmath101 , the mesonic fluctuations will be larger than @xmath90 , which means that the meson - loop expansion or @xmath0 expansion could not be used any more . in the case of only scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons involved ,",
    "@xmath102 is reasonable , otherwise , heavier vector mesons should be considered .    even though we can not answer the question",
    "how much the magnitude of the mesonic fluctuations and corrections are , because the model parameters are not uniquely determined , we can conclude that the cancellation between the nlo contributions and the one - quark - loop with quark mass deviation from the mean - field value induces an appropriate mesonic corrections to the mean - field approximation , and no chiral symmetry restoration or instabilities of the vacuum is found .",
