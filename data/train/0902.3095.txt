    "the absolute value of interstellar extinction to an individual star is difficult to determine , and so is its wavelength dependence . toward the galactic center ( gc ) , however , we can directly derive the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction , assuming only that the center of stellar distribution in the lines of sight is at the same distance from us and that the foreground extinction is patchy ; such a principle has been employed for star clusters and is referred to as the cluster method or variable - extinction method @xcite . by plotting the apparent magnitude versus the color excess of a group of stars , one obtains a straight line with the slope equal to the total to selective extinction ratio , e.g. , @xmath14 .",
    "this variable - extinction method was applied for the red clump ( rc ) stars around the gc by @xcite at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and by @xcite as the `` rc method '' at @xmath15 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite measured the peak position of the rc stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of each small ( @xmath17 ) field in their survey area of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the reddening and the extinction were derived from the relative shifts of the peak color and the peak magnitude , respectively .",
    "here the most important point is that the magnitude of extinction accompanied by a certain amount of reddening can be derived exactly , as long as no difference in 1 ) the mean distance , 2 ) the mean absolute magnitude , and 3 ) the mean color of the rc population exists among the small fields .",
    "since the survey is deep enough and the survey area of a few degrees ( projected area of a few hundred pc at the gc ) does not seem to have different rc population correlated with the amount of foreground extinction , this assumption is reasonable .",
    "the ratios of total to selective extinction , @xmath14 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 were in turn used to derive the wavelength dependence of extinction @xmath22 . when approximated as a power law of the wavelength @xmath23 , the interstellar extinction @xmath24 toward the gc decreases as @xmath25 in the wavelength range of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , being steeper to the longer wavelength than the @xcite result @xmath26 .",
    "direct measurements of _ extinction _ are extremely difficult because of the uncertainty of the distance of light sources .",
    "therefore , the ratios of _ reddening _ ( ratios of color excesses ; e.g. , @xmath27 ) are generally determined first , and then these color excess ratios are transformed into the absolute extinction @xmath28 with some assumptions . for this purpose , the total to selective extinction ratio @xmath29 is often derived somehow , either by extrapolation of the color excess diagram to the longer wavelength or by a certain assumption , and then employed with the equation @xmath30 so long as one compares the color excesses , which are obtained directly and accurately , meaningful comparison is possible for different determinations , and many attempts have been made in this color - color method .",
    "however , caution must be exercised in the use of absolute extinction @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite determined the extinction law toward the gc from 1 to 13 @xmath0 m by the color excess observations of five supergiants near the gc and @xmath31 sco .",
    "they first set @xmath32 for all the stars and assumed @xmath33 for the extinction toward the gc .",
    "the lower limit of total to selective extinction ratio 3.09 was determined from the decrease of extinction in the range of @xmath34 m , but the observation at these wavelengths was relatively uncertain .",
    "longward of 3 @xmath0 m , @xcite and @xcite observed hydrogen recombination line emission toward the gc with the _ infrared space observatory _ sws instrument and found that the extinction curve is much flatter than the @xcite results .",
    "@xcite compared the observed fluxes and expected fluxes predicted for the hii region in an aperture of @xmath35 centered on sgr a@xmath36 .",
    "they confirmed the applicability of the case b conditions from the observations of different upper - level lines .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xcite had to assume a @xmath37 band extinction of 3.47 mag because the ratio of reddening , not the absolute extinction , in the hydrogen line strengths were derived also in their determination .",
    "the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction toward the gc , therefore , can be summarized as follows .",
    "the extinction in the near - infrared wavebands @xmath38 is fitted well by a steep power law @xmath39 , but decreases only slightly beyond @xmath40 m , and then shows a large maximum due to the silicate absorption at @xmath41 m .",
    "the steep power law in the wavelength range @xmath42 m and flat curve in @xmath43 m is consistent with the polarimetry results @xcite , which can be regarded , in a sense , as an absolute determination of the difference between the extinctions of two orthogonal axes .    in directions of other than the gc ,",
    "flat extinction dependence in the wavelength range of @xmath44 m has also been derived .",
    "@xcite measured the mean color excess ratios from the color distributions of stars observed with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ sst _ ) , along two lines of sight in the galactic plane .",
    "investigations toward five nearby star - forming regions @xcite and the star - forming dense core barnard 59 @xcite also suggest relatively flat extinction curves from 3 to 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "all these studies obtained color ratios , either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , first .",
    "then these color excess ratios are transformed into the absolute extinction ratio ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) on the assumption of one ratio ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) using the equation @xmath49 assuming their distribution in the galactic plane , @xcite fitted the locus of rc stars in a color magnitude diagram and derived @xmath50 . then using the equation ( [ eq : alambda ] ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite derived the absolute extinction ratios .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , such extinction ratios of @xmath48 on the assumption of the rc star location in the galactic plane might be more accurate than the extrapolation of the @xmath45 curve toward the longer wavelength to get the absolute extinction values as in equation ( [ eq : alambda1 ] ) , but one should keep in mind that the assumption of the one ratio can lead to large errors in @xmath51 .",
    "color excess ratios with the _ sst_/irac bands are different between the star forming regions and the diffuse interstellar medium , and a difference in the extinction law between them was suggested @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the center of distribution in the lines of sight is at the same distance from us for the rc giants and the giants in the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) , and determined the total to selective extinction ratios @xmath52 for the irac wavebands while we use the irsf / sirius ( similar to the the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) near - infrared photometric system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey results for the @xmath5 band . also , using the rc and upper rgb stars toward the gc , the total to selective extinction ratios @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) bands were derived , and the agreement to the steep extinction law determined by @xcite is examined in the 2mass bands .",
    "we compare these results with the previous determination of interstellar reddening in different lines of sight , and discuss their difference .",
    "this variation of the `` rc method '' is unique and different from any previous determinations of mid - infrared extinction because it is free from the transformation equations ( [ eq : alambda1 ] ) and ( [ eq : alambda ] ) .",
    "it is on the assumptions of the same mean distance and magnitude of the rc star population among the small fields , of the agreement of the central positions of the spatial distributions of the rc and rgb stars , and that the upper rgb stars have colors varying only with luminosity .",
    "the distance to the rc stars seem to be rather constant @xcite in this range of galactic longitudes , and it seems reasonable to assume that the rc and rgb stars have similar spatial distributions .",
    "the upper rgb has been used for determining the interstellar reddening and extinction by many investigators . @xcite",
    "used rgb stars with the unreddened @xmath37 magnitude range of 8.0 to 12.5 .",
    "they compared the rgb colors of the inner bulge ( @xmath56 ) with that of the baade s window @xcite , and derived the interstellar extinction .",
    "they also found that the amplitude of metallicity variations in the inner bulge does not cause large rgb slope changes in the @xmath57 versus @xmath37 cmd .",
    "@xcite used calculated isochrones as reference in drawing the extinction map of the inner bulge , and @xcite again used the baade s window data as reference in their determining the extinction within @xmath58 of the gc . note that although we have no reliable reference of reddening - free rgb in the _",
    "sst_/irac bands , only the relative shifts of magnitude and color are needed in the current work .",

    "about 20 sources were used to construct the psf for each image .",
    "we performed a photometric calibration with 2mass point source catalog @xcite . when fitted with the gauss function , the histograms of the difference of the 2mass and sirius magnitudes ( @xmath60 ) in the three bands for more than @xmath61 stars have standard deviations of @xmath62 , suggesting that the accuracy of the zero - point calibration for each star is about 0.03 mag .",

    "these trends , smaller n@xmath68 and larger s@xmath68 , have been obtained in @xmath110 @xcite , and similar variations in the extinction law seem to be present among the quadrants in the mir wavebands .",
    "we note again that we do not find statistically significant evidence for differing the extinction laws in different lines of sight toward the gc in the irac wavebands .",
    "since most of stars we detected are in the bar structure whose major axis is oriented at @xmath111 with respect to the sun - galactic center line , different average distance of the giants in a given patch of the sky may cause systematic shifts in positions of the rc peaks and the rgb colors on the @xmath5 versus @xmath112 plot . as shown in @xcite , mean",

    "a good test for the existence of this systematic error is to compare the ratios @xmath88 for the quadrants , because the error should be reduced in smaller regions due to smaller difference of the distance .",
    "as described above , we found insignificant deviation of @xmath88 for the quadrants , and very small difference between the ratios for all the survey area and the weighted mean for the quadrants ( see table [ tab : slopessubr ] ) , suggesting very small systematic shifts on the @xmath5 versus @xmath112 plots due to the difference of the distance .    to confirm that the current method using the rgb and rc stars in deriving the total to selective extinction ratios is consistent with the @xcite method using only the rc stars , we re - analyzed the @xcite data using the rgb and rc stars .",

    "however , since @xcite laid great emphasis on the determination of @xmath183 in accordance with the reddening data taken before , @xmath3 magnitudes of @xmath31 sco , cyg ob2 no.12 , and only two stars near the galactic center were measured with relatively large uncertainties in the color excesses mainly due to the assumed errors in intrinsic colors of these stars . therefore , the color excesses they determined @xmath184 and @xmath185 on the assumption of @xmath186 might be in fact compatible with the current results if we allow for these uncertainties .    the extinction ratios toward the gc in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands in the 2mass system are consistent with the irsf / sirius results , as shown in table [ tab : slopes ] .",
    "these ratios are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : slopessi2 m ] , and are consistent with a power law @xmath13 , together with the @xcite results .",
    "therefore , it is established that the interstellar extinction toward the gc in the range of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands is well fit by a steep power law of @xmath187 , not @xmath26 . of course , the power law is only an approximation . since 1 ) the extinction shows positive deviation from the power law as the wavelength increases to @xmath188 m as we see above , and 2 ) a number of dust grain models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict such positive deviation , it is possible that the power index changes in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 wavelength range .",
    "a number of authors obtained the ratios of color excesses first , and then derived the wavelength dependence @xmath189 of the interstellar extinction .",
    "however , the assumed ratio @xmath190 leads to a quite different wavelength dependence , as is evident from the equation ( [ eq : alambda ] ) and was already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , we convert our @xmath189 to the ratios of color excesses and compare them with the previous results ( fig . [ fig : colehkekl ] ) .",
    "this process causes larger errors because of the error propagation , but not any uncertainty at all due to assumption of an unknown parameter as in the inverse procedure .",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained @xmath46 ( or its reciprocal ) from the slopes of the distributions of stars in color - color diagrams .",
    "@xcite measured the color excess ratios @xmath45 , but @xmath46 was derived from color - color diagrams ( _ open squares _ ) by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 2 ) using the same data sets of @xcite and the same method as used in @xcite .",
    "thus , direct comparison of the wavelength dependence of extinction is possible in color - excess ratios . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colehkekl ] , the color - excess ratios @xmath46 are plotted against @xmath191 following the convention to compare with scattering calculation .",
    "differences in @xmath46 seem to exist between the star forming regions and the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the ratios toward the star forming dense core @xcite and the nearby star forming regions @xcite are very similar , and are in very good agreement within their errors . as indicated by @xcite",
    ", we can find a systematic separation of the ratio toward the off - cloud regions @xcite from toward the star forming regions .",
    "the ratios obtained in this study ( calculated from @xmath9 ) tend to have lower values than those for star forming regions , in the three bands but [ 8.0 ] .",
    "the higher extinction in the [ 8.0 ] band in the direction of the gc than that toward @xmath192 @xcite is consistent with the claim that the gc line of sight has larger silicate absorption relative to @xmath193 ( larger @xmath194 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than other lines of sight ( see also table 1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a separation between the extinction laws for molecular clouds and for the diffuse interstellar medium in the color excess ratios @xmath195-[4.5 ] } / e_{[4.5]-[5.8]}$ ] suggested by @xcite is not confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : colehkekl ] due to the large uncertainties .",
    "however , we can find a clear difference in @xmath46 between the star forming regions and the off - cloud regions including toward the gc .",
    "absolute extinction has only been measured for the gc , and comparison with other lines of sight requires an assumption of at least one extinction ratio ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) . here",
    ", we assume a single power law for the interstellar extinction instead , and try to derive its index .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath196 in ngc 2024/2023 , ngc 2068/2071 , and serpens , which are @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "they also derived the ratio for the @xmath200 region @xcite with the result of @xmath201 , pointing that no significant variation seems to exist in the near - infrared extinction law through these molecular clouds and through the diffuse interstellar medium . assuming the effective wavelengths of the 2mass observations to be 1.240 , 1.664 , and 2.164 @xmath0 m @xcite and that the extinction is approximated by a power law",
    ", we can derive the power law index for these lines of sight .",
    "the resultant indices are from @xmath202 to @xmath203 .",
    "thus , the interstellar extinction for all these lines of sight seems to be fitted by a single power law of @xmath13 , which is the same as that in the gc , very well in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 wavelength range .",
    "however , the extinction law derived by @xcite decreases much more slowly to the longer wavelength ( slower than @xmath204 ) , and nonetheless their data are shown by @xcite to have a consistent @xmath196 ratio @xmath201 .",
    "( note that table 1 in @xcite lists smaller @xmath196 ratios , possibly because of the difference in the selection criteria of background stars by them and by @xcite . ) therefore , from the color excess ratios one can not resolve the degeneracy .",
    "both a steep power law upto the @xmath5 band similar to the gc and a much gentler extinction curve are consistent with the color excess ratios . in particular",
    ", the frequently employed @xmath12 color - color diagrams can be quite insensitive to the change in extinction law .",
    "hence , we can not determine a value of @xmath48 even from a seemingly similar @xmath196 values .",
    "we further should be cautious , because line - of - sight differences in @xmath196 do seem to exist .",
    "for example , @xcite found color excess ratios in @xmath205 oph and cha i star - forming regions consistent with that in the gc , but a significantly larger ratio in the coalsack globule 2 @xcite .",
    "it is quite straightforward to determine @xmath189 in this work from the direct measurement of the ratios of total to selective extinction @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , to derive @xmath189 in the equation ( 2 ) in the color - color method is a difficult and crucial task , which @xcite made from the determination of @xmath190 .",
    "since @xcite and @xcite did not determine @xmath190 , they converted their color excess ratios to @xmath189 using the ratio @xmath206 derived by @xcite .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence for universality of @xmath190 , and a different @xmath190 leads to a different @xmath189 as described in  [ subsec : compratiocol ] , and as also pointed out by @xcite . the difference is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alakorig ] in which @xmath207 in addition to @xmath208 is used to derive another set of @xmath189 ratios based on the @xcite and @xcite color excess observations .",
    "the ratio of @xmath206 produces larger separation between the line of sights to molecular cloud and diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the average of the four lines of sight to the star - forming regions studied by @xcite and the dark cloud core by @xcite show higher extinction in the irac bands than the gc and the @xmath200 diffuse medium @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if we assume the ratio of @xmath207 , the molecular - cloud data points shift to the gc and the diffuse interstellar medium , although @xmath209 is needed to make the results of @xcite and @xcite agree with our results .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the near - infrared extinction laws are different in the dense clouds and diffuse clouds , then the difference continues to the mid - infrared , and vice versa .",
    "currently , we do not have sufficient data to distinguish these two possibilities because the measurement of the total to selective extinction is very difficult in the lines of sight other than the gc .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath210 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : colehkekl ] ) and the required @xmath211 of @xmath212 suggest that all of the observational results discussed in this paper can not be reconciled with a single extinction law .",
    "we have measured the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction toward the gc in the 1.2 - 8.0 @xmath0 m region by combining the irsf / sirius infrared observations and the 2mass and _ sst_/irac catalogs .",
    "the extinction in the wavelength range of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is well fitted by a power law of steep decrease @xmath13 toward the gc .",
    "furthermore , the flattening of the extinction from a simple extrapolation toward the longer wavelength of the power law at @xmath213 m has been confirmed . in particular , the extinction has a relatively shallow and broad minimum in the _",
    "sst_/irac wavelength range ; @xmath214}$ ] and @xmath215}$ ] are only slightly smaller than 0.4 times @xmath216 .",
    "this dependence has been derived directly from the observation of reddening in proportion to the @xmath5 extinction for the first time involving the _",
    "sst_/irac wavebands . in this , the @xmath5 magnitudes of rc stars and the @xmath6 colors of rgb stars serve as a tracer of the reddening vector in the color - magnitude diagrams , and the ratios of total to selective extinction @xmath8 have been obtained by a variant of the `` rc method '' originated from the variable - extinction method .",
    "it is interesting to note that this method is only sensitive to the spatially variable component in the surveyed area ; when a star cluster suffers patchy @xmath217mag extinction from region to region , then the total to selective extinction ratio for the variable @xmath218mag component is derived , but the characteristics of the ubiquitous @xmath219 mag extinction component remain unknown .",
    "this can be its strong point because it is not so sensitive to the intrinsic magnitudes and colors of these background stars ; on the other hand , the location of the dust grains causing this variable extinction in the long line of sight to the gc is not certain .",
    "however , since the silicate absorption seems fairly strong , the dominant grain population probed in this method is probably in the vicinity of the gc .",
    "it should be also noted that the assumptions used here are that the rc stars and rgb stars have spatial distributions with their centers in common , and that the reddening of rgb stars can be measured precisely from the shape of upper giant branch .",
    "the wavelength dependence seems to be different among the various lines of sight . in particular , the gc and off - cloud regions show different extinction law from star - forming regions , although the difference is not very large compared to the observational uncertainties .",
    "the general behavior of extinction curves , which decreases steeply in the near - infrared , but decreases only slightly beyond the @xmath5 band , is an important constraint when dust grain models are discussed .",
