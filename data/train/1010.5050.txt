    "nuclei can survive beyond the macroscopic limit , far into the transuranium region , where the necessary balance between the nuclear and coulomb force is achieved only through shell stabilisation .",
    "superheavy element ( she ) are hypothesised to exist in this region .",
    "the next double shell closer , beyond @xmath6pb , predicted at z=114 , n=184 , may have suprisingly long half - life , even of the order of a million year @xcite .",
    "experimentally , till to - date , elements upto z=118 have been synthesised by heavy ion reactions @xcite , with half - lives ranging from a few minutes to about a milli - second .",
    "the more microscopic theoretical calculations have predicted the next region of stability , beyond z=82 , n=126 , as z=120 , n=172 or 184 @xcite and z=124 or 126 , n=184 @xcite .",
    "however , the recent experimental possibility of z=122 from natural @xmath7th - isotopes , associated with long lived superdiformed ( sd ) and/ or hyperdeformed ( hd ) isomeric states @xcite , by 16 to 22 orders of magnitude longer than their corresponding ground - state , and more recently the synthesis of z=117 at flerov laboratory @xcite from the reaction @xmath8ca+@xmath9bk@xmath10117 ( z=117 , a=297 ) , which decay simultaneously via three and four neutrons into two differnet isotopes @xmath4117 and @xmath5117 , motivates us to focus on their properties , using a microscopic theoritical model with better predictive power . such estimations of structure properties of nuclei in the superheavy mass region is a challenging area in nuclear physics and a fruitful path towards the understanding of  island of stability \" beyond the spherically doubly - magic nucleus @xmath6pb .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief description of the relativistic mean field formalism .",
    "the pairing effects for open shell nuclei , included in our calculations , are the same as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculation are presented in section iii , and section iv includes the @xmath1-decay modes of @xmath4117 and @xmath5117 isotopes .",
    "a summary of our results , together with the concluding remarks , are given in the last section v.",
    "the relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many - body system @xcite , @xmath11 all the quantities have their usual well known meanings . from the above lagrangian",
    "we obtain the field equations for the nucleons and mesons .",
    "these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis , with an initial deformation @xmath12 .",
    "the set of coupled equations is solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method .",
    "the centre - of - mass motion energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula @xmath13 .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath14 is evaluated from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , as @xmath15 .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass number , and @xmath18 is the deformed density .",
    "the total binding energy and other observables are also obtained by using the standard relations , given in @xcite .",
    "we use the well known nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "this set reproduces the properties of not only the stable nuclei but also well predicts for those far from the @xmath19-stability valley . as outputs ,",
    "we obtain different potentials , densities , single - particle energy levels , radii , deformations and the binding energies . for a given nucleus",
    ", the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground state and other solutions are obtained as various excited intrinsic states .",
    "the constant gap , bcs - pairing approach is reasonably valid for nuclei in the valley of @xmath19-stability line .",
    "however , this method breaks down when the coupling of the continuum becomes important . in the present study",
    ", we deal with nuclei on or near the valley of stability line since the superheavy elements , though very exotic in nature , lie on the @xmath19-stability line . in order to take care of the pairing effects in the present study , we use the constant gap for proton and neutron , as given in @xcite , which are valid for nuclei both on or away from the stability line ( for more details , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath20 , the pairing energy , is also defined ) .",
    "in many of our previous works and of other authors @xcite , the ground state properties , like the binding energies ( be ) , pairing energies @xmath20 , quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath14 , charge radii ( @xmath21 ) , and other bulk properties , are evaluated by using the above stated relativistic langragian for different forces . from these predictions , it is found that , generally speaking , most of the recent parameter sets reproduce well the ground state properties , not only of stable normal nuclei but also of exotic nuclei far away from the valley of @xmath19-stability .",
    "this means to say that if one uses a reasonably well accepted parameter set , the predictions of the model will remain nearly force independent . in this paper",
    "we have used the successful nl3 parameter sets for our calculation .",

    "for example , the values of @xmath3 from rmf coincide well for the whole mass region with the available experimental data , and with extrapolated values for @xmath36rg , @xmath37113 and @xmath38115 nuclei .",

    "8(a ) and ( b ) , and table iii , we found almost similar results as are predicted in the previous subsection for @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the rmf(nl3 ) results for both @xmath22 and @xmath35 agree well with the known extrapolated and experimental data , but once again over - estimate the frdm results . for example , the @xmath3 values for rmf coincide well with the experimental data for the whole isotopic chain and with the extrapolated data for @xmath40115 , @xmath41113 , @xmath42rg , @xmath43mt and @xmath44bh nuclei . similarly ,",

    "summarizing , we have calculated the binding energy , the rms charge and matter radii , and quadrupole deformation parameter for the isotopic chain of recently synthesized z=117 superheavy element for both the ground- as well as intrinsic first - excited states , using the rmf formalism . from the calculated binding energy ,",
    "we have also estimated the two - neutron separation energy and the energy diffence between ground- and first - excited state for studying the shape co - existence , for the isotopic chain .",

    "we found a shape change from oblate to prolate deformation , with increase of isotopic mass number , at a=292 .",

    ", we found that the most stable isotope in the series is @xmath0117 , which is close to predicted magic number at n=172 .",
