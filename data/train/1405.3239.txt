    "a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) is a bubble of relativistic particles and magnetic field inflated by a rotation - powered pulsar , emitting centrally peaked synchrotron radiation .",
    "young pwne are frequently found inside shell supernova remnants ( snrs ) , where the relativistic wind of electron - positron pairs ( and perhaps ions ) experiences a wind termination shock close to the pulsar due to the pressure of the snr interior . beyond this wind shock ,",
    "the relativistic fluid can radiate synchrotron emission from the radio to the x - ray band , and inverse - compton ( ic ) emission at higher energies .",
    "a pwn / snr combination is often called a ` composite ' snr .",
    "pwne can outlive their snr and interact directly with the interstellar medium .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the detailed characterization of pwn spectra gives information on the particle energy distribution produced by the pulsar , and also on the nature of acceleration in relativistic shocks .",
    "however , spectral structure present immediately downstream of the wind shock can be altered by propagation effects including diffusive transport and radiative losses , which may depend on the evolution of the entire pwn . the ability to use pwne as laboratories in which to study the behavior of relativistic pair plasmas depends largely on the extent to which these various effects can be disentangled .",
    "models studying pwne with time - dependent , one - zone , homogeneous approximations , provide insights into the evolution of the spectrum across all energy bands of the nebula as a whole .",
    "broadband spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) , coupled with spatially resolved spectroscopy , are required for this purpose .",
    "radially - dependant models also provide valuable insights by addressing detailed spatial and spectral structures of pwne .",
    "the classic work of @xcite , which invokes a particular hydrodynamic model , predicts the spectral break between the optical and x - ray energy bands , as well as the behavior of size with photon energy for the crab nebula .",
    "implicit in that calculation is a prediction for the radial dependence of the spectrum . @xcite",
    "assume particle transport by pure advection in a spherical geometry ; this situation predicts a roughly uniform nebular spectrum with radius until the ( energy - dependent ) nebular edge , where radiative energy losses sharply steepen the spectrum .",
    "this behavior is generally inconsistent with observations @xcite , in particular in several objects a fairly uniform spectral steepening with radius is observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the cause of spectral structure is of interest beyond the specific pwn context ; if its origin is in the physics of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks , the results have implications for other objects which share the same shock mechanisms .",
    "however , the structure may be due instead to transport and evolutionary effects in the pwn post - shock flow . at the same time , spatially integrated spectra of pwne are not well understood , especially in their most salient feature  a large steepening of the spectrum between the flat radio emission and the considerably steeper spectra observed from ir through x - rays .",
    "@xcite documents differences between radio and x - ray spectral indices of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for seven out of the eight pwne modeled , compared to radiative energy losses in homogeneous steady sources which can produce , at most , @xmath7 .",
    "if this break is not due solely to evolutionary effects and instead is due to at least , in part , to intrinsic spectral structure in the particle distribution injected at the wind shock , it is implying something important and interesting about particle acceleration in pulsar winds .",
    "21 was discovered in 1970 @xcite in the radio band , and first observed in the x - ray band in 1981 @xcite .",
    "it is a classic example of a crab - like pwn : it has a filled , mostly symmetric spherical morphology centered on a pulsar .",

    "the flux is substantially dimmer than the pwn .",
    "this symmetric emission was proposed to be an extension of the pwn itself @xcite , but the absence of coincident radio emission , and the recognition of the importance of dust scattering for the large column density toward g21.5 - 0.9 , led @xcite and @xcite to model the smoothly distributed halo emission as due to dust scattering .",
    "additionally , two regions of brightened emission were discovered near the outer edges of the halo , referred to as the north spur and eastern limb @xcite that could not be explained by dust scatter .",

    "there are several possible origins for the spectral break seen by _",

    "the effects of the large ism extinction @xcite again would not cause such a sharp , defined energy break .",
    "similarly , the loss effect of dust scattering at lower energies is negligible ( below @xmath173)in the _ nustar _",
    "band because of the relatively low column absorption .",
    "contributions from the pulsar are also not likely to be responsible .",
    "most pulsars have a harder spectrum than the pwn they power .",
    "while this could in fact cause a sharp transition between photon indices , it would cause spectral hardening with energy , not the softening seen by _",
    "nustar_. finally , spectral breaks are often attributed to synchrotron cooling , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the break energy of 9  kev would require an unreasonably low magnetic field strength of @xmath174  @xmath175 , compared to the @xmath176  @xmath177 g derived from equipartition arguments @xcite .",
    "the prominent spectral steepening between radio and x - rays , if interpreted with simple cooling models , yields magnetic field strengths ranging from @xmath178 @xcite to @xmath179 @xcite .    it is likely that the spectral break results from physical effects , either due to a break in the injected electron energy spectrum or due to energy losses due to particle transport in the pwn .",
    "pulsars emit pairs of relativistic electrons and positrons , which are accelerated at a termination shock near the pulsar itself .",
    "downstream of the termination shock the accelerated electrons interact with the magnetic field , also produced by the pulsar , and subsequently emit synchrotron radiation from the radio through gamma energy bands .",
    "the injection spectrum can therefore shape and influence the spectrum of the synchrotron radiation , as noted by @xcite .",
    "these authors propagate a broken power - law electron spectrum through a time - dependent model that includes energy losses due to synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering , and adiabatic cooling .",

    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _",

    "nustar_.    it is therefore reasonable to explore whether a more complex model can explain the 9  kev spectral break .",
    "@xcite extend the models with the addition of diffusive losses as well as a broken injection spectrum with a discontinuity at the break energy .",
    "however , both the aforementioned sed models do not include the spatial dependence of parameters such as the magnetic field of the pwn , which provides additional complexity and can perhaps better fit the x - ray data .",
    "we explore these effects in the following sections .",
    "particle transport in pwne has long been a matter of discussion and study .",
    "unfortunately , few celestial objects are both bright enough and large enough to allow distinguishing radially - dependant features to fit to the various existing models .",
    "the crab nebula , 21 and 3c 58 are such pwne .",
    "they have been frequently observed and analyzed , and have provided valuable insights into the physics of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows and relativistic shocks that govern the appearance of pwne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . extending the energy range of analysis will allow for more detailed probing of radially - dependant physics .",
    "this information is important both to understand pwne and to isolate the properties of the relativistic shock at the pwn inner edge from the subsequent spectral evolution downstream .",
    "we shall ask : can the observable parameters of 21 from radio to x - ray be reproduced assuming the shock injects only a single structureless power - law particle spectrum ?    one such parameter used as a spectral fingerprint of various models is the radial dependency of the power - law photon index .",
    "numerous observations have confirmed softening of the 21  pwn spectrum with increasing projected radius @xcite .",
    "this is shown at higher energies for the _ nustar _",
    "observations in figure [ fig : rve ] .",
    "the softening is associated with synchrotron cooling of the electrons , and the corresponding decrease in the maximum emitted x - ray energy in the bulk velocity flow downstream of the termination shock .",
    "an alternative approach is to characterize the variation of source size with photon energy using a characterization of the ` cooling length ' @xmath125 , such as the source fwhm .",
    "since only the energy - dependence of this length is important for modeling the spectral steepening , its precise definition is not important .",
    "this scale depends only on mapping the total number of photons as a function of radius and energy to determine the scale length @xmath125 .",
    "this is more straightforward than spectral modeling because counting statistics are almost always limited , and length scale measurements do not require determining a spectrum at each radius .",
    "we therefore use the cooling length scale , with fwhm as its surrogate , as the fundamental diagnostic for extracting information about physical conditions .",
    "we shall also make use of the observed steepening from radio to x - rays of 21 through the parameter @xmath180 .",
    "most discussions of pwn physics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) simply take this as an intrinsic property , but we shall attempt to explain it through evolutionary effects .    there exist two prominent mechanisms that have been invoked to explain pwne particle transport : advection and diffusion . beginning with @xcite and @xcite , diffusion has long been investigated as a cause for the characteristics of a pwn . however , the early models of particles propagating outwards from a central source purely by diffusion , applied exclusively to the crab nebula , have been unable to account for the detailed x - ray properties of the crab , such as its change of size with frequency @xcite .",
    "pure advection models have also been proposed , such as @xcite .",
    "the canonical theory involving pure advection as the method of particle transport was presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kc84 ) .",
    "when kc84 was used to predict the radial behavior of the spectrum , the resultant spectral photon index has little to no variation from the center of the nebula outwards , and begins to vary only towards the pwn periphery ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tc12 , figure 2 ) .",
    "this also does not match the observed behavior of a slowly - steepening x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "tc12 provide a nuanced approach to particle transport by diffusion and present two updated models .",
    "they claim that the magnetic field is not predominately toroidal far from the termination shock , as is often assumed in pwn theory , but has a more complex geometry with cross - field transport best described by diffusion .",
    "their first model consequently incorporates pure diffusion only , with both the magnetic field and diffusion coefficient constant with radius , and synchrotron emission as the only loss of energy .",
    "tc12 argue that such a model better explains the radial dependence of @xmath169 as seen in the crab , 3c58 , and 21 , with proper adjustment of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "involving complexities such as an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient might be more physically reasonable , but the data are not sufficiently constraining to distinguish these cases from a simple diffusion model .    while the pure diffusion model of tc12 appears to describe observations of the crab and 3c 58 relatively well , we argue that it is less appropriate for 21 . it does provide a good description of @xmath181 for the crab and 3c 58 ( @xmath182 ) , however the fit of this model to the 21  @xmath183  kev data is poor ( @xmath184 ) , as seen in figure 6 in tc12 .",
    "in addition , the ratio of advective to diffusive timescales that determines what process dominates is radially dependant .",
    "using @xmath185 downstream of the pwn termination shock ( kc84 ) , and the know relationships @xmath186 and @xmath187 , we obtain @xmath188 .",
    "21  is very compact , with a size more than two times smaller than that of the other two pwne , and thus advection is likely to dominate .",
    "finally , the advective model provides a good fit to the energy dependent cooling length scale ( see below ) .",
    "tc12 presented the radially - dependant spectral index @xmath181 rather than using the cooling length scale @xmath125 as characteristic of their model , which makes fitting the model to higher energy _",
    "data too difficult .",
    "the second model presented by tc12 involves a monte carlo simulation that includes both diffusion and advection transport close to and farther away from the pulsar , respectively .",
    "this allows a more complex treatment than previous analytical models @xcite . while likely a more appropriate approach for 21 , tc12 only applied this simulation to the crab and 3c 58 .    kc84 provide a complete advective solution for a steady , spherically symmetric wind terminated by a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shock .",
    "although kc84 is routinely applied to determine quantities such as the mean downstream magnetic field , its range of applicability is in fact more narrow .",
    "kc84 represents an idealized theory , suited to the case of constant injection of electrons in a spherical geometry , transported outward by pure advection in an ideal mhd flow with an ordered , toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the model does not attempt to reproduce the crab spectrum from radio to x - rays , but only the optical to x - ray portion , with an injection spectral index of optically emitting electrons of @xmath189 .",
    "the predicted value of steepening of @xmath190 of 0.51 is roughly appropriate ( so their cooling break is at uv wavelengths ) .",
    "this value is fortuitously close to the value of 0.5 for a stationary , homogeneous source .",
    "thus this model also can not reproduce radio - to - x - ray seds of many other pwne , including 21 , which have a larger @xmath191 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the @xmath181 relationship predicted by the kc84 model is flatter in the pwn interior and softens towards the edges , as shown by @xcite , while generally a gradual variation in @xmath181 is observed .",
    "this has motivated several generalizations of kc84 .",
    "the values we obtain from the _ nustar _  data for @xmath125 and @xmath192 are clearly inconsistent with the model presented in kc84 .",
    "the gradients implied by the assumptions of kc84 , predict @xmath193 , independent of spectral index , and @xmath194 for the physically important inner flow region . if we attempt to apply the kc84 formalism to describe the radio - to - x - ray spectrum of g21.5 - 0.9 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 , we fail on both counts .",
    "first , we find @xmath4 ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "second , we find the observed spectral indices in the radio and x - ray bands produce @xmath198 , instead of 5/9 from a kc model using the injected spectral index of @xmath199 .",
    "* hereafter r09 ) noted that there are a number of physical effects not accounted for in kc84 that could produce a steeper spectral break than @xmath200 .",
    "for example , the magnetic field may have a significant radial or turbulent component , or it may not satisfy mass conservation due to cloud evaporation , or it may not have magnetic flux conservation ( e.g. due to magnetic reconnection or turbulent amplification ) .",
    "r09 constructed a simple model that includes these effects .",
    "the model involves generating simple scaling relations for the downstream magnetic field @xmath201 , fluid velocity field @xmath202 , and fluid density @xmath203 in terms of the dimensionless length scale @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the inner injection radius .",
    "the non - spherical geometrical effects could also be parameterized in terms of jet width @xmath206 where @xmath207 corresponds to a conical jet or a section of spherical outflow ; a confined jet has @xmath208 , while a flaring jet would have @xmath209 . by assuming @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 all vary as power - laws in @xmath210 with indices @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , r09 obtains a series of general consistency relations that these indices must satisfy with each other and with observable parameters . these variables of @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath191 ,",
    "the energy scaling of the cooling length , particle injection index and spectral index break , respectively , provide constraints on the allowed values of @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",
    "the results of r09 can be rewritten in terms of the functional form of @xmath214 , and assuming @xmath220 as observed for g21.5 - 0.9 : @xmath221 independent of @xmath218 .",
    "since we observe @xmath222 and @xmath223 , this gives @xmath224 .",
    "the possible solutions are thus very restrictive for our measured value of @xmath191 and @xmath214 .",
    "additionally , if the flow conserves mass ( disallowing , for instance , mass loading by evaporation of thermal material ) , then the density index @xmath219 is linked to the velocity index @xmath218 . in this case",
    ", some solutions are unphysical , such as those with @xmath225 , corresponding to an accelerating downstream fluid . with some judicious rejection of such solutions we can draw some interesting general conclusions , based on the possible values of the observables , which may guide further investigations .    for a conical or spherical flow , @xmath226 ,",
    "so either density or magnetic - field strength , or both , must _ rise _ with radius ( since either @xmath219 or @xmath217 is positive , or both ) .",
    "mass conservation links @xmath219 to @xmath218 , but if that assumption is abandoned , there is no relation and no constraint on the velocity profile  only the density profile matters for observable quantities .",
    "a steeply decelerating flow can produce @xmath227 with mass conservation , but mass loading can also do this . similarly , @xmath228 can be a reasonable outcome of flux non - conservation through processes such as reconnection .",
    "our observations require one or both of these effects : addition of mass to the flow through some kind of evaporation , and increase in magnetic - field strength beyond flux freezing .",
    "a strongly confined jet ( @xmath208 ) can relax some constraints ; for @xmath229 , we only require @xmath230",
    ". however , even here either mass or flux nonconservation is necessary .",
    "one can construct constant density solutions ( @xmath231 ) but such a geometry is disfavored due to the high symmetry of 21  as evidenced in both the broad axial symmetry observed in the radio @xcite and in the soft x - ray band @xcite .    while @xcite expands on the treatment of kc84 , both fail to reproduce the steadily steepening spectrum with radius shown by g21.50.9 and other pwne .",
    "this shortcoming is characteristic of models in which particles are transported outwardly purely by advection , so that all particles at a given radius have similar ages . to produce steady spectral steepening",
    "probably requires a mixture of particles of different ages at each radius .",
    "this could be caused by more complex fluid flow such as the back flows found in simulations by @xcite , or by particle diffusion .",
    "we conclude that a model describing both the radio - to - x - ray spectrum of 21 and the size shrinkage with x - ray energy we observe can be accommodated in a pure advection model requiring the injection of only a straight power - law spectrum of electrons , @xmath232 . however , as with all pure advection models , the gradual rather than sudden steepening of the spectrum with radius is not reproduced . the viability of this explanation for the observed properties of 21  will depend on whether the addition of diffusion can reproduce the gradual steepening while preserving the successes of the advection model .",

    "within the @xmath130  kev band , the count rates are 4 and 1.5 higher than the background for the * powerlaw * and * srcut * models , respectively .",
    "this implies that the * srcut * model should be marginally visible up to @xmath132  kev , and above @xmath132  kev should have a count rate equal to that of the background .",

    "however , the _ nustar _  images with a combined exposure of 281 ksec do not detect any statistical emission above @xmath132  kev , indicating that * srcut * is the more plausible spectral model for the north spur .",

    "this is consistent with the intensity distribution with position angle seen in the lower energy image .",
    "a question unresolved by previous x - ray observations is whether the shell emission is thermal or non - thermal .",

    "the thermal * pshock * model predicted a shell flux which would not produce the x - ray emission seen by _",
    "nustar _  at @xmath254  kev .",
    "in contrast , the three non - thermal models produced x - ray fluxes consistent with imaging of the eastern limb by _ nustar _ , although the * srcut * and * powerlaw * models could not be distinguished from each other . nonetheless , the _ nustar _",
    "observations firmly establish the non - thermal nature of the shell x - ray emission .",
    "the detection of a non - thermal shell up to quite high x - ray energy in 21  is interesting , and is in contrast to observations of other crab - like supernova remnants .",
    "recently shells have been detected in 3c58 @xcite and g54.1 + 0.3 @xcite , and a clear , detached shell of emission in kes 75 @xcite .",
    "however the 3c58 shell is clearly thermal , with no sign of a non - thermal component .",
    "the shell of @xmath255 can be fit with both thermal and non - thermal models , however a thermally emitting shell seems much more likely .",
    "assuming thermal emission , @xcite were able to use pwn - snr evolutionary models to obtain an age consistent with the characteristic age derived from pulsar observations , obtain the proper supernova - pwn radius ratio , and predict that the reverse shock has not encountered the pwn yet , consistent with other observations .",
    "the ages of 3c58 and g54.1 + 0.3 are @xmath256 years and @xmath257 years , respectively .",
    "21  is thus unique in that it is much younger ( @xmath258 years ) , and potentially has higher forward shock speed , both of which could lead to the detectable non - thermal shell .",
    "the crab nebula itself , of comparable age to 21  but much closer , still shows no non - thermal shell , presumably due to a very low interstellar medium density .",
    "the detection of this 21  non - thermal shell at quite high x - ray energy is thus likely due to its younger age compared to these other crab - like snrs .",
    "we have presented an analysis of a 281  ks _ nustar _",
    "observation of 21  to probe the spatial and spectral characteristics revealed by high - energy x - ray emission .",
    "_ nustar _ s broad energy band makes it uniquely suited to analyze not only the pwn but observe the characteristics of the snr shell as well .",
    "the spectrum taken from the entire remnant is described by a best - fit broken power - law with a break energy of @xmath2  kev .",
    "this is the first instance where a single instrument was able to capture this break .",
    "the addition of the _ nustar _",
    "spectrum to sed models from @xcite produces a poor fit to the x - ray data .",
    "this suggests that further modeling is required : more complex electron injection spectra , additional loss processes such as diffusion , or radial dependence of the pwn parameters .",
    "spectra extracted from various radial annuli were also fit with both an absorbed power - law and an absorbed broken power - law model .",
    "the two regions @xmath259 and @xmath260 are statistically better fit with a broken power law with @xmath261  kev , while the regions with radii @xmath262 are best - fit with a single power law .",
    "we observe spectral softening of the spectral index below the spectral break , while the spectral index above the break is constant within uncertainties .    image analysis allows us to measure the energy - dependent cooling length scale and fit the relationship with a power - law model of @xmath124 .",
    "this yields an index of @xmath126 . incorporating this with the spectral indices in both the radio and x - ray bands , we are able to systematically approach the equations of @xcite and inspect the parameter space for physically consistent solutions .",
    "we found that , for a conical jet or spherical outflow , the most reasonable solutions do not conserve magnetic flux but do conserve mass , indicating turbulent magnetic field amplification .",
    "the bulk velocity decelerates steeper than that predicted by kc84 .",
    "we detect the eastern limb and north spur at energies above 10  kev for the first time .",
    "a deconvolution method provids clear evidence of emission from the north spur up to @xmath132  kev .",
    "extrapolation of the spectral fits obtained by _",
    "chandra _  show that the * srcut * model is favored over the * powerlaw * model .",
    "this further solidifies the assumption that the north spur is an interaction of the sn ejecta with the remnant .",
    "we also detect the eastern limb up to @xmath132  kev .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of non - thermal emission from the limb , and conclude this faint feature is the sn shell of 21 .",
    "we are unable to distinguish between the non - thermal models fit to the eastern limb by _ chandra_.",
