    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) was primarily built to explore the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in proton - proton collisions characterised by parton - parton scatterings with a high momentum transfer .",
    "these parton - parton scatterings are unavoidably accompanied by interactions between the proton remnants which are often called the `` underlying event '' ( ue ) and have to be modelled well in order to be able to measure high - momentum - transfer processes to high accuracy .",
    "since the ue is dominated by low - scale strong - force interactions , in which the strong coupling strength diverges and perturbative methods of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lose predictivity , it is extremely difficult to predict ue - sensitive observables from an ab - initio calculation in qcd . as a result",
    ", one has to rely on models implemented in general - purpose monte carlo ( mc ) event generators .",
    "generators such as herwig  7 @xcite , pythia  8 @xcite , sherpa @xcite , and epos @xcite contain multiple partonic interactions ( mpi ) as well as qcd radiation in the initial and final state to describe the ue . a correct modelling of the underlying event in pp - collisions is important for the proper simulation of kinematic distributions of high - energy collisions .",
    "event - shape observables measured with the atlas detector @xcite at the lhc using charged particles in inclusive z - boson events are presented in ref .",
    "the measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 1.1  fb@xmath0 of pp - collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath1  tev .",
    "charged - particle distributions , excluding the lepton - antilepton pair from the z - boson decay , are measured in different ranges of transverse momentum of the z boson .",
    "these distributions include multiplicity , scalar sum of transverse momenta , beam thrust , transverse thrust , spherocity , and f - parameter , which are in particular sensitive to properties of the underlying event at small values of the z - boson transverse momentum .",
    "a detector - level measurement of track distributions sensitive to the properties of the underlying event is presented in ref .",
    "it is based on an integrated luminosity of 151  @xmath2b@xmath0 of pp - collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3  tev .",
