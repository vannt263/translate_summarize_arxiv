    "in order to be manipulated and transmitted information should be encoded into some degree of freedom of a physical system . ultimately , this means that the input alphabet should correspond to the spectrum of some observable , _ i.e. _ that information is transmitted using _",
    "quantum signals_. at the end of the channel , to retrieve this kind of quantum information , one should measure the corresponding observable . as a matter of fact",
    ", the measurement process unavoidably introduces some disturbance , and may even destroys the signal , as it happens in many quantum optical detectors , which are mostly based on the irreversible absorption of the measured radiation .",
    "actually , even in a measurement scheme that somehow preserves the signal for further uses , one is faced by the information gain versus state disturbance trade - off , _",
    "i.e. _ by the fact that the more information is obtained , the more the signal under investigation is being modified .",
    "actually , the most informative measurement of an observable @xmath0 on a state @xmath1 corresponds to its ideal projective measurement , which is also referred to as von neumann _ second kind _ quantum measurement @xcite . in an ideal projective measurement",
    "the outcome @xmath2 occurs with the intrinsic probability density @xmath3 , whereas the system after the measurement is left in the corresponding eigenstate @xmath4 .",
    "a projective measurement is obviously repeatable , since a second measure gives the same outcome as the first one .",
    "however , the initial state is erased , and the conditional output do not permit to obtain further information about the input signal .",
    "the opposite case corresponds to a fully non - destructive detection scheme , where the state after the measurement can be made arbitrarily close to the input signal , and which is characterized by an almost uniform output statistics , _",
    "i.e. _ by a data sample that provides almost no information .",
    "besides fundamental interest , the realization of a projective measurement of the quadrature would have application in quantum communication based on continuous variables . in facts",
    ", it provides a reliable and controlled source of optical signals . on the other hand ,",
    "a fully non - destructive measurement scheme is an example of a quantum repeater , another relevant tool for the realization of quantum network . between these two extremes",
    "we have the entire class of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements .",
    "such intermediate schemes provide only a partial information about the measured observable , and correspondingly are only partially distorting the signal under investigation . in particular , in this paper",
    ", we show how to attain an optimized qnd measurement of quadrature _ i.e. _ scheme which minimizes the information gain versus state disturbance trade - off .",
    "most of the schemes suggested for back - action evading measurements are based on nonlinear interaction between signal and probe taking place either in @xmath5 or @xmath5 media ( both fibers and crystals ) @xcite , or on optomechanical coupling @xcite .",
    "a beam - splitter based scheme has been earlier suggested to realize optical von neumann measurement @xcite .",
    "here , we focus our attention on an interferometric scheme which requires only linear elements and single - mode squeezers .    a schematic diagram of the suggested setup is given in fig .",
    "[ f : setup ] .",
    "the signal under examination @xmath6 and the probe ( meter ) state @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are eigenstates of the field quadratures @xmath11 , @xmath10 of the two modes , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the corresponding wave - functions .",
    "the two beams are linearly mixed in a mach - zehnder interferometer with internal phase - shift given by @xmath14 .",
    "there are also two @xmath15 plates , each imposing a @xmath16 phase - shift .",
    "overall , the interferometer equipped with the plates is equivalent to a beam splitter of transmittivity @xmath17 . however , the interferometric setup is preferable to a single beam splitter since it permits a fine tuning of the transmittivity . after the interferometer ,",
    "one of the two output modes is revealed by homodyne detection , whereas the second mode is firstly displaced by an amount that depends on the outcome of the measurement ( feedback assisted amplitude modulation ) , and then squeezed according to the transmittivity of the interferometer ( see details below ) . as we will see , either by tuning the phase - shift of the interferometer , or by exciting the probe state @xmath7 in a squeezed vacuum , and by varying the degree of squeezing , the action of the setup ranges from a projective to a non - destructive measurement of the field quadrature as follows :    1 .",
    "the statistics of the homodyne detector ranges from a distribution arbitrarily close to the intrinsic quadrature probability density of the signal state @xmath18 to an almost uniform distribution ; 2 .",
    "the conditional output state , after registering a value @xmath19 for the quadrature of the signal mode , ranges from a state arbitrarily close to the corresponding quadrature eigenstate @xmath20 to a state that approaches the input signal @xmath6 .",
    "the two features can be summarized by saying that the present scheme realizes the whole set of qnd measurements of a field quadrature .",
    "in addition , the interferometer can be tuned in order to minimize the information gain versus state disturbance trade - off , _",
    "i.e. _ to achieve an optimal qnd measurement of quadrature .",
    "such a kind of measurement provides the maximum information about the quadrature distribution of the signal , while keeping the conditional output state as close as possible to the incoming signal .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we analyze the dynamics of the measurement scheme , and describe in details the action of linear feedback and tunable squeezing on the conditional output state and on the homodyne distribution . in section",
    "[ s : lim ] we analyze the limiting cases of strongly squeezed and anti - squeezed probes , which correspond to projective and non - destructive measurements respectively . in section [ s : opt ] we introduce two fidelity measures , in order to quantify how close are the conditional output and the homodyne distribution to the input signal and its quadrature distribution respectively . as a consequence",
    ", we are able to individuate an optimal set of configurations that minimize the trade - off between information gain and state disturbance .",

    "this noise can be manipulated by suitably squeezing the probe , thus realizing the whole set of qnd measurement .    squeezed or anti - squeezed vacuum probes are described by the wave - functions @xmath48 where the information about squeezing stays in the requirement @xmath49 .",

    "the improvement in the precision due to squeezing , compared to that of a vacuum probe , can be quantified by the ratio of variances in the filtering gaussian of eqs .",
    "( [ vacond ] ) and ( [ sqcond2 ] ) .",

    "notice that , in principle , both projective and non - destructive measurements could be obtained with vacuum probe , simply by varying the internal phase - shift of the interferometer according to eqs .",
    "( [ vacprobx0 ] ) and ( [ vacond ] ) .",
    "however , this would affect also the _ rate _ of the events at the output ( since @xmath14 governs the transmittivity of the interferometer ) , and therefore may be not convenient from practical point of view .",
    "on the other hand , when a fine tuning of the variances in eqs .",
    "( [ sqcond1]-[sqcond4 ] ) is needed ( as for example in the optimization of the scheme , see next section ) it can be conveniently obtained by varying @xmath14 , without the need of varying the degree of squeezing of the probe .",
    "so far we considered the two extreme cases of infinitely squeezed or antisqueezed probes .",
    "now we proceed to quanti - fy the trade - off between the state disturbance and the gain of information for the whole set of intermediate cases .",
    "there are two relevant parameters : i ) how close the output signal is to the input state , and ii ) how close the homodyne distribution is to the intrinsic quadrature probability . according to eq .",

    "in conclusions , we have suggested an interferometric scheme assisted by squeezing and linear feedback to realize an arbitrary qnd measurement of a field quadrature . compared to previous proposals the main features of our setup",
    "can be summarized as follows : i ) it involves only linear coupling between signal and probe , ii ) only single mode transformations on the conditional output are needed , and iii ) the whole class of qnd measurements may be obtained with same setup either by tuning the internal phase - shift of the interferometer , or by varying the squeezing of the probe .",
    "the present setup permits , in principle , to achieve both a projective and a fully non - destructive quantum measurement of a field quadrature . in practice , however , the physical constraints on the maximum amount of energy that can be impinged into the optical channels pose limitations to the precision of the measurements .",
    "this agrees with the facts that both an exact repeatable measurement and a perfect state preparation can not be realized for observables with continuous spectrum @xcite .",
    "of course , other limitations are imposed by the imperfect photodetection and by the finite resolution of detectors @xcite .",
    "compared to a vacuum probe , the squeezed / anti - squeezed meters suggested in this paper provide a consistent noise reduction in the desired fidelity figure already for moderate input probe energy .",
    "in addition , by varying the squeezing of the probe an optimal qnd measure can be achieved , which provides the maximum information about the quadrature distribution of the signal , while keeping the conditional output state as close as possible to the incoming signal .",
