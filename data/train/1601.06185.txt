    "the most spectacular manifestation of the special role played by @xmath17 in sxy criticality is the relation @xcite @xmath21    since the size of the link gets progressively larger for weaker links ( if the barrier height is limited , its length has to increase ) the rg flow is formulated in the space of system sizes rather than distances . when doubling the system size , @xmath22 , the renormalization of the macroscopic superfluid stiffness is due to one or a few anomalously weak links .",

    "we confine ourselves to unit filling factor .",
    "given the exponential divergence of the correlation length on approach to the quantum critical point , brute - force numerical and experimental approaches to reveal the thermodynamic limit properties are out of the question .",
    "in the vicinity of the critical point , the system size @xmath20 should be considered as another  parameter . \"",
    "we thus look for an asymptotically exact rg theory describing physics at large enough @xmath20 , thereby allowing one to analytically extrapolate numerical and experimental data to arbitrarily large @xmath20 .",
    "the mutual effect of sxy and gs criticalities is described by three flow equations .",
    "our analysis of the flow reveals an interesting fact that the competition is unequal : the gs ( instanton  anti - instanton ) contributions remain subdominant with respect to those of the weak links till the tri - critical point ; _ i.e. _ , physics of weak links defines the shape of the sf - bg phase boundary in the vicinity of this point .",
