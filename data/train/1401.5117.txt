    "stars form exclusively in molecular clouds , although the question whether molecular gas is a prerequisite or a byproduct of star formation is currently under debate ( e.g. , glover & clark 2012 ; kennicutt & evans 2012 ; krumholz 2012 ) . in either case ,",
    "accurate measuruments of the physical properties of molecular clouds are critical to constrain the initial conditions for star and molecular gas formation . however , obtaining such measurements is hampered by the fact that molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , the most abundant molecular species in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , is not directly observed under the typical conditions in molecular clouds . as a homonuclear diatomic molecule , h@xmath0 does not have a permanent electric dipole moment and its ro - vibrational states change only via weak quadrupole transitions . therefore ,",
    "alternative tracers have been employed to infer the abundance and distribution of h@xmath0 .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is one of the most commonly used tracers of h@xmath0 due to its large abundance and low rotational transitions that are readily excited in molecular clouds through collisions with h@xmath0 . in particular , the @xmath12co(@xmath13 ) integrated intensity , @xmath3 , is often used to estimate the h@xmath0 column density , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , via the so - called `` @xmath14-factor '' , which is defined by @xmath15 accurate knowledge of @xmath1 is crucial to address some of the fundamental questions in astrophysics .",
    "for example , one of the most intriguing properties of galaxies is a strong power - law relation between the surface density of star formation rate , @xmath16 , and the surface density of h@xmath0 , @xmath17 , generally known as the `` kennicutt - schmidt relation '' ( e.g. , schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1989 ; bigiel et al .",
    "2008 ; schruba et al .",
    "2011 ; rahman et al . 2012",
    "; shetty et al .",
    "while this empirical relation provides important insights into the physical process of star formation ( e.g. , a close connection between the chemical or thermal state of the ism and star formation ) , its precise form has been a subject of debate and strongly depends on @xmath1 . from an observational perspective",
    ", @xmath1 is usually adopted as a conversion factor .",
    "its estimate relies on the derivation of @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) using observational methods independent of co ( bolatto et al .",
    "2013 for a review ) .",
    "one of the methods to derive @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) utilizes dust as a tracer of total gas column density .",
    "dust has been observed to be well mixed with gas ( e.g. , boulanger et al .",
    "1996 ) and can be mapped through its emission at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths or its absorption at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the procedure is to estimate the dust column density or the @xmath18-band extinction , @xmath9 , from the fir emission or the nir absorption ( e.g. , cardelli et al . 1989 ) and to assume or to estimate a dust - to - gas ratio ( dgr ) that linearly relates @xmath9 to the total gas column density @xmath2(h ) = @xmath2(hi ) + 2@xmath2(h@xmath0 ) . the atomic gas column density , @xmath2(hi )",

    "2006 ) used the uclpdr code ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2002 ) to calculate chemical abundances and emission strengths and showed that @xmath1 changes by more than an order of magnitude with varying depths within molecular clouds .",
    "in addition , they found significant variations in @xmath1 between molecular clouds with a wide range of physical parameters , e.g. , density , metallicity , and cloud age . while the pdr models are limited to simple geometries and density distributions , three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations",
    "have been recently performed to investigate @xmath1 in turbulent molecular clouds ( e.g. , glover & mac low 2011 ; shetty et al .",

    ". such variability of @xmath1 within resolved clouds and between clouds with different properties predicted by the pdr and mhd models has been rarely found in observations , largely due to the lack of high - resolution observations . in this paper",
    ", we derive @xmath1 for the perseus molecular cloud on sub - pc scales and test two theoretical models of the formation of molecular gas , in an attempt to understand the origins of the variations in @xmath1 and the physical processes of h@xmath0 and co formation . one model is the one - dimensional pdr model originally developed by tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) and updated by kaufman et al .",

    "( 2011a ) that is based on the modified zeus ",
    "mp code described in glover et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( hereafter the s11 model ) .",
    "there are two primary differences between these two models .",
    "first , the s11 model simulates h@xmath0 and co formation in turbulent molecular clouds by coupling the chemical and dynamical evolution of gas , while the modified w10 model takes into account the impact of turbulence only via a constant supersonic linewidth for spectral line formation and cooling .",
    "second , the s11 model follows the time - dependent evolution of a number of chemical species , including h@xmath0 and co , while the modified w10 model uses a detailed time - independent chemical network that explicitly assumes chemical equilibrium for every atomic and molecular species .",
    "therefore , we consider the modified w10 model and the s11 model as representative `` microturbulent time - independent model '' and `` macroturbulent time - dependent model '' .",

    "we summarize the results from previous studies highly relevant to our investigation and provide constraints on important physical parameters of perseus . in section 3 , we describe the multi - wavelength observations used in our study . in section 4 , we divide perseus into a number of individual regions and select data points for each region .",

    "finally , lee et al .

    "it is most likely , therefore , that combinations of changes in density , turbulent linewidth , isrf , and possibly other parameters we do not test in our study result in the variations in @xmath1 across the cloud .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with pineda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who suggested that local variations in density , non - thermal gas motion , and isrf can explain the observed scatter of @xmath1 among the sub - regions in perseus .    because @xmath1 depends on many properties of the ism , constraining physical conditions by matching models to the observed value of @xmath1 requires a search through a large parameter space .",

    "as it has been shown in s11 and glover & mac low ( 2007b ) that the simulated h@xmath106 and co column densities do not depend on small changes in @xmath47 and @xmath59 , this simulation would be appropriate for the comparison with our observations ( section 8.4.1 for details ) .",
    "compared to the modified w10 model , the final density distribution in the s11 model has a majority of the data points ( @xmath499% ) with @xmath37 < 10@xmath38 @xmath39 , resulting in the small median density of @xmath430 @xmath39 .",
    "another important difference between the modified w10 model and the s11 model is that h@xmath0 formation in the s11 model does not achieve chemical equilibrium until the end of the simulation .",
    "for example , glover et al . (",
    "2010 ) found from their mhd simulations that the h@xmath0 abundance primarily depends on the time available for h@xmath0 formation and shows no indication of chemical equilibrium up to @xmath139 @xmath4 20 myr .",
    "the gas will eventually become fully h@xmath0 unless the molecular cloud is destroyed by stellar feedback such as photoevaporation by hii regions and protostellar outflows . on the other hand ,",

    "the final products of the s11 model include the @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath3 images obtained at @xmath139 @xmath4 5.7 myr .",
    "we smooth and regrid the simulated @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath3 images so that they have both a spatial resolution of 0.4 pc and a pixel size of 0.4 pc .",
    "recently , beaumont et al . (",
    "2013 ) compared the complete data of perseus with the s11 model and found that the s11 model systematically overestimates @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) ( e.g. , figure 5 of beaumont et al .",
    "one of the possible explanations for this discrepancy is the different size between the simulation box and the individual regions in perseus . because the simulation box is larger than the individual regions in perseus ( 20 pc vs @xmath457 pc ) , the integrated quantities @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath3 would need to be scaled . in the case of @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , the scaling is straightforward under the assumption of isotropic density distribution , which is appropriate for the s11 model , and we simply need to account for the difference between the box and region sizes .",
    "however , estimating a proper scaling for @xmath3 is much more complicated because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath3 image was produced from the s11 model by integrating the co brightness temperature , which was estimated by three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations , along a full radial velocity range .",
    "second , the co emission is optically thick in some parts of the simulation ( @xmath410% of the volume ) .",
    "re - running the simulation with a smaller box does not solve the problem as molecular cores / clouds form out of initially larger - scale diffuse ism .",
    "we therefore take an approach of determining the optimal line of sight ( los ) depth that minimizes the difference between our observations and the s11 model by investigating the @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) images simultaneously . for the simulated @xmath3 image , on the other hand",
    ", we do not apply any scaling . to do this",
    ", we estimate the difference between the observed mean and the simulated mean for each of @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) with varying los depths . for example",
    ", we divide the simulated @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) images by two to calculate the mean @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) for the simulation with the los depth of 10 pc .",
    "we then normalize the difference by the observed mean of each quantity and calculate the sum of the two normalized differences in quadrature .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f : box_size ] and we find that the los depth that minimizes the difference between our data and the simulation products is 7 pc ( figure [ f : box_size]c ) .",
    "while the final quantity in figure [ f : box_size](c ) has a broad minimum , it is encouraging that the estimated scale length is comparable to both the characteristic size of the five regions in perseus and the total size of the slab for the `` core - halo '' model ( tables 1 and 2 ) . as a double check",
    "that this scale length is appropriate , we use larson s law established for turbulent molecular clouds from both observations and mhd simulations : @xmath140 km s@xmath8 ( heyer & brunt 2004 ) . for a region size of 20 pc",
    "we expect @xmath88 @xmath4 6 km s@xmath8 , while for a region size of 7 pc we expect @xmath88 @xmath4 3 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this level of co velocity dispersion is in agreement with what is shown in figure [ f : co_vel_dispersion ] , confirming that scaling the simulation products to the los depth of 7 pc is reasonable . in summary ,",
    "when we compare our observations with the s11 model , we scale the simulated @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath2(h ) images by multiplying them by 7/20 ( figures [ f : histo_perseus_s11]a , b , c , and figures [ f : hi_tot_s11]a , b ) . on the other hand , because of the uncertainty in @xmath3 scaling , we use the original @xmath3 image produced by the s11 model ( figure [ f : histo_perseus_s11]d and figures [ f : hi_tot_s11]c , d ) . finally , we apply the following thresholds to the simulated data to mimic the sensitivity limits of our observational data : @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) > 3.3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath3 > 0.09 k km s@xmath8 ( our mean 1@xmath101 uncertainties calculated for the data points with @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) > 0 @xmath7 and @xmath3 > 0 k km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this application of the thresholds to the s11 model is reasonable , considering the minimum @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) @xmath4 3.8 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath3 @xmath4 0.2 k km s@xmath8 for the five regions in perseus .",
    "we first compare our data with the s11 model by constructing normalized histograms of @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , @xmath2(h ) , and @xmath3 in figure [ f : histo_perseus_s11 ] . to construct the histograms",
    ", we use the data points with @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) > 0 @xmath7 in figure [ f : h2_cden_display ] ( `` all '' histograms in black ) , as well as those shown in figure [ f : complete_five_regions ] ( `` subset '' histograms in grey ) .",
    "while the grey histograms are limited to the regions where the co emission is detected , the black histograms represent the whole perseus cloud .",
    "the simulated data from the s11 model ( smoothed , regridded , scaled for 7 pc , and the thresholds applied ) are shown as green histograms .",
    "note that the @xmath3 values from the s11 model are not scaled and therefore the green @xmath3 histogram likely represents the upper limit of actual histogram for sub - regions with a size of @xmath47 pc ( indicated as an arrow ) . because the simulated data ( except for @xmath3 ) are scaled to match the properties of the five regions and the thresholds applied to the s11 model are comparable to the minimum @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath3 values of the five regions , the green histograms can be directly compared with the grey histograms . in comparison between our data and the s11 model ,",
    "we find the following .",
    "first , the black and grey @xmath2(hi ) histograms are nearly identical .",
    "this results from the small variation in @xmath2(hi ) across the whole perseus cloud , as discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "the green histogram , on the other hand , has a peak at a factor of @xmath42 smaller @xmath2(hi ) and even more importantly a factor of @xmath46 broader distribution than the observed data ( the black and grey histograms ) .",
    "second , the grey and green @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) histograms agree very well : both peak at a similar @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , have a similar width , and show a lognormal - like distribution . the black histogram , on the other hand , is broader and has a tail toward small @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the difference between the black and grey histograms results from the existence of h@xmath0 beyond the co spatial coverage ( e.g. , `` co - dark '' h@xmath0 discussed in lee et al .",
    "third , the green @xmath2(h ) histogram peaks at a similar @xmath2(h ) compared to the grey histogram , while showing a broader ( a factor of @xmath42 ) and lognormal - like distribution .",
    "the simulated distribution is broader mainly because the simulated @xmath2(hi ) has a greater range than what is observed .",
    "the black and grey histograms , on the other hand , have a tail toward @xmath2(h ) @xmath11 10@xmath141 @xmath4 2.5 @xmath5 10@xmath100 @xmath7 .",
    "this tail is consistent with kainulainen et al .",

    "lastly , because the simulated @xmath3 is not scaled for the los depth of 7 pc , we do not compare the exact shapes of the green and grey histograms but emphasize that the simulated @xmath3 becomes comparable to the observed @xmath3 only if we use the whole simulation box of 20 pc .    in summary , we find that the scaled s11 model reproduces the observed range of @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) very well . while the predicted @xmath2(hi ) has a relatively similar mean value compared to the observed @xmath2(hi ) , it has a broader distribution and this leads to a broader range of @xmath2(h ) in the simulation .",
    "the @xmath3 values from the s11 model , on the other hand , can not be properly compared with our observations because of the nontrivial scaling of @xmath3 with the los depth .",

    "for example , dame et al . ( 2001 ) estimated @xmath144 @xmath4 1.2 @xmath5 10@xmath22 for perseus , which is a factor of @xmath44 larger than our @xmath108 @xmath4 3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 , by combining @xmath3 from the cfa survey with @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) derived using the @xmath145 data from schlegel et al .",

    "our @xmath1 smoothed to 36@xmath23 resolution , we find that spatial smoothing results in a factor of @xmath41.5 increase in @xmath108 . considering a factor of @xmath48 decrease in angular resolution",
    ", the effect of resolution on the estimation of @xmath108 appears to be mild and is within the accepted uncertainties , although this would be likely more significant when comparing extragalactic observations on @xmath4kpc scales .",
    "we then find that the rest of the difference between our @xmath108 and @xmath146 can be explained by the difference in dgr . while both studies measured dgr , dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculated @xmath2(hi ) along a whole line of sight ( while we focused on the velocity range for perseus only ) and estimated dgr using the images smoothed to 10@xmath20 resolution ( while we had 4.3@xmath23 resolution ) .",
    "the dgr effect is slightly larger than the resolution effect ( a factor of @xmath41.8 ) and these two factors together account for most of the difference between our study and dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the case of pineda",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) , angular resolution is not an issue because essentially the same @xmath9 and @xmath3 data were used .",
    "however , they estimated @xmath147 @xmath4 1.4 @xmath5 10@xmath22 for perseus .",
    "their methodology for deriving @xmath1 is different from our study mainly in two ways .",
    "first , they assumed that the @xmath2(hi ) contribution to @xmath9 is insignificant and therefore did not consider it .",

    ", we show that we estimate @xmath108 @xmath4 1 @xmath5 10@xmath22 , which is comparable to @xmath147 , when we follow the methodology of pineda et al .",
    "in addition , we find that the application of each of the two assumptions made by pineda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) results in a factor of @xmath42 difference in @xmath108 , altogether explaining the difference between our @xmath108 and @xmath147 .    our detailed comparison with dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and pineda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows that different resolutions and methodologies for deriving @xmath1 can result in a difference in @xmath1 by up to a factor of @xmath44 , even for the same method of @xmath1 determination ( @xmath1 based on dust emission / absorption in this case ) .",
    "other methods of @xmath1 determination , e.g. , @xmath1 based on the virial technique and @xmath148-ray observations , have their own assumptions .",
    "this clearly suggests the difficulty in comparing @xmath1 between molecular clouds and/or galaxies when different observational methods are used , as pointed out by bolatto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) as well .",
    "the relatively uniform value of @xmath1 for the milky way found from many studies with various resolutions and methodologies , therefore , appears puzzling .      in section 6.3 , we focused on the individual dark and star - forming regions in perseus and found significant spatial variations in @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , @xmath1 varies by up to a factor of @xmath4100 within a single region with a size of @xmath467 pc .",
    "our investigation of the large - scale trends in @xmath47 and @xmath88 ( section 6.1 ) and our comparison with the modified w10 model ( section 7.1 ) suggest that changes in physical parameters are responsible for the variations in @xmath1 observed both within the individual regions and between the different regions .",
    "while @xmath1 shows significant variations across the cloud , we found that there is a characteristic dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath9 ( particularly evident for ic348 and b1e / b1 ) : a steep decrease of @xmath1 at @xmath9 @xmath10 3 mag and a moderate increase of @xmath1 at @xmath9 @xmath11 3 mag .",
    "this relation between @xmath1 and @xmath9 appears to result from the strong dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath9 .",
    "the location at which most carbon is locked in co primarily depends on dust shielding ( e.g. , w10 ; glover & mac low 2011 ) .",
    "once dust shielding becomes sufficiently strong to prevent photodissociation ( @xmath9 @xmath11 1 mag in perseus ) , the co abundance and emission strength sharply rise and this could result in decreasing @xmath1 with @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath3 then saturates to a certain value because the co emission becomes optically thick with increasing depths ( @xmath9 @xmath11 3 mag in perseus ) and this could result in increasing @xmath1 with @xmath9 .",
    "these results suggest that co is a poor tracer of h@xmath0 for those regions where dust shielding is not strong enough to prevent photodissociation , e.g. , low - metallicity environments ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 , 2011 ; cormier et al . 2014 ) .",
    "in addition , co is unreliable for those regions where the co emission is optically thick , because it provides only a lower limit on @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "overall , our study suggests that one can not adopt a single @xmath1 to derive the @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) distribution across a resolved molecular cloud .",
    "the limited dynamic range of co as a tracer of h@xmath0 and the complex dependence of @xmath1 on various physical parameters hamper the derivation of the accurate @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) distribution . on the other hand , calculation of the h@xmath0 mass over the co - observed area , @xmath149(h@xmath0)@xmath150 ,",
    "appears to be less affected by variations in physical parameters .",
    "for example , we estimate @xmath149(h@xmath0)@xmath150 = ( 1799.8 @xmath21 3.2 ) m@xmath25 over the complete co spatial coverage . if we derive @xmath149(h@xmath0)@xmath150 using our @xmath108 , we find @xmath149(h@xmath0,@xmath1)@xmath150 = ( 1814.1 @xmath21 0.2 ) m@xmath25",
    ". these two estimates are comparable for perseus , mainly because a large fraction of the data points ( @xmath460% ) has @xmath1 different from our @xmath108 within a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "the agreement between the observed @xmath1 in perseus and the model predictions ( in particular for the pdr model ) suggests that a theory - based @xmath1 could be used to estimate @xmath149(h@xmath0)@xmath150 for a molecular cloud .",
    "once theoretical models , e.g. , pdr and mhd models , are thoroughly tested against observations of molecular clouds in diverse environments , they will be able to provide predictions over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "one then can search a large parameter space to select the most appropriate @xmath1 for a target molecular cloud based on reasonable constraints on physical parameters .",
    "note , however , that the total h@xmath0 mass of the cloud would be still uncertain if there is significant `` co - dark '' h@xmath0 outside the co - observed area .",
    "the good agreement between our data and the modified w10 model with the `` core - halo '' structure ( section 7.1.2 ) suggests that the main assumptions of the model , e.g. , h@xmath0/co formation in chemical equilibrium , the microturbulent approximation for co spectral line formation , and the `` core - halo '' density distribution , are valid for perseus on @xmath40.4 pc scales .",
    "this result is consistent with lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who found that @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) in perseus conform to the time - independent h@xmath0 formation model by k09 .",
    "we now turn to a couple of interesting aspects of the modified w10 model and discuss their implications .      the modified w10 model that is comparable to the observations of perseus uses the `` core - halo '' structure motivated by previous studies of molecular clouds ( section 7.1.1 ) .",
    "we showed that the model with a uniform density distribution predicts @xmath2(hi ) much smaller than the uniform @xmath2(hi ) @xmath4 9 @xmath5 10@xmath22 @xmath7 measured across perseus . the uniform density model with the largest density @xmath37",

    "the main reason is that in the uniform density model h@xmath0 self - shielding alone counteracts h@xmath0 photodissociation by lw photons .",
    "traditionally , it has been known that @xmath47/@xmath37 determines whether h@xmath0 self - shielding or dust shielding is more important for h@xmath0 formation and controls the location of the transition from hi to h@xmath0 in a pdr ( e.g. , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) . with @xmath47 = 0.5 @xmath54 and @xmath37 = 10@xmath38 @xmath39 in the uniform density model , @xmath47/@xmath37",

    "the fact that the modified w10 model needs a diffuse hi halo to reproduce the observed @xmath2(hi ) suggests that dust shielding is important for h@xmath0 formation in perseus .",
    "this importance of dust shielding is consistent with what lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found from their comparison with the k09 model .",
    "the k09 model investigates the structure of a pdr in a spherical cloud based on h@xmath0 formation in chemical equilibrium and predicts the following variable as one of the key parameters that determine the location of the transition from hi to h@xmath0 :    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the metallicity normalized to the solar neighborhood value and @xmath155 is the ratio of the actual cnm density to the minimum cnm density at which the cnm exists in pressure balance with the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "this @xmath156 is the ratio of the rate at which lw photons are absorbed by dust grains ( dust shielding ) to the rate at which they are absorbed by h@xmath0 ( h@xmath0 self - shielding ) and is conceptually similar to @xmath47/@xmath37 .",
    "k09 predicts @xmath156 @xmath4 1 in all galaxies where the pressure balance between the cnm and the wnm is valid , suggesting that dust shielding and h@xmath0 self - shielding are equally important for h@xmath0 formation . by fitting the k09 model to the observed @xmath29 vs @xmath28+@xmath17 profiles , lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) indeed found @xmath156 @xmath4 1 for perseus .    in the modified w10 model , a diffuse hi halo",

    "the uniform density model predicts the shallower increase of @xmath3 at smaller @xmath9 @xmath11 0.6 mag , suggesting a less sharp transition from cii / ci to co located closer to the surface of the gas slab .",
    "the more extended co distribution eventually results in the reduced `` co - free '' h@xmath0 envelope and therefore the uniform density model with @xmath37 = 10@xmath24 @xmath39 would have the smallest amount of `` co - dark '' h@xmath0 . the co distribution deep inside of the gas slab ,",
    "on the other hand , does not appear to be affected by the presence of the diffuse hi halo because of the saturation of @xmath3 .    even though the modified w10 model with the `` core - halo '' structure reproduces the observed @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath3 distributions , the agreement is likely to remain only if the halo density is not significantly larger than 40 @xmath39 .",

    "finally , further comparisons between observations and theoretical models will be important to fully constrain the parameter space and density structure of the hi halos .",

    "the gas in the s11 model would be strongly compressed and rarefied by turbulence and the gas density at a given @xmath9 can vary over several orders of magnitude ( e.g. , figure 14 of glover et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this case",
    ", co can form in dense clumps even at small @xmath9 and @xmath3 therefore shows a large scatter .",
    "this scatter is reduced at large @xmath9 where @xmath3 eventually saturates .",
    "finally , turbulent mixing could spread the co distribution , contributing to the large scatter of @xmath3 .",
    "in general , our study shows that the scaled mhd simulation by s11 is successful in reproducing @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) in perseus , which is a low - mass , old molecular cloud most likely in chemical equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "future model adjustments are required to better match the observed @xmath2(hi ) and @xmath3 . we have revealed two important areas of future attention : ( 1 ) the role of diffuse halos in the formation of molecular gas and ( 2 ) the effect of density fluctuations and turbulent mixing in the spatial distribution of molecular gas . to investigate these two issues",
    ", we plan to compare observations of several galactic molecular clouds with mhd simulations that explore different fractions of neutral phases and a varying degree of turbulence as initial conditions .",
    "in particular , our future work will include molecular clouds less evolved and/or forming more massive stars ( therefore more turbulent ) than perseus , where the difference between the mhd and pdr models is likely to be more pronounced .",
    "in this paper , we combine high - resolution h@xmath0 and co measurements to investigate @xmath1 across the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "we derive the @xmath1 image at @xmath40.4 pc spatial resolution by using @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) estimated by lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and @xmath3 provided by the complete survey .",
    "we examine the large - scale spatial variations in @xmath1 across the cloud and their correlations with local ism conditions .",
    "in addition , we focus on the characteristic dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 images allow us to test two theoretical models of h@xmath0 and co formation : the modified w10 model ( `` microturbulent time - independent model '' ) and the s11 model ( `` macroturbulent time - dependent model '' ) . for several dark and star - forming regions in perseus ( b5 , b1e / b1 , l1448 , ic348 , and ngc1333 )",
    ", we investigate @xmath2(hi ) vs @xmath2(h ) , @xmath29 vs @xmath2(h ) , @xmath3 vs @xmath9 , and @xmath1 vs @xmath9 and compare the results with model predictions .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows .    1",
    ".   we derive @xmath169 3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 for perseus .",
    "this value is a factor of @xmath44 smaller than the previous estimate of @xmath1 @xmath4 1 @xmath5 10@xmath22 for the same cloud ( dame et al .",
    "2001 ; pineda et al . 2008 ) and the discrepancy mainly results from different resolutions , dgrs , and our consideration of @xmath2(hi ) in deriving @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we find a factor of @xmath43 region - to - region variations in @xmath1 . the northeastern part of perseus ( b5 and ic348 ) has on average larger @xmath1 than the southwestern part ( b1e / b1 , ngc1333 , and l1448 ) .",
    "this could be explained by a stronger @xmath47 and/or a smaller @xmath88 in the northeastern part , although the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath47/@xmath88 are mild .",
    "additionally , variations in @xmath37 and/or @xmath9 could contribute to the observed regional variations in @xmath1 . within the individual dark and star - forming regions with a size of @xmath467 pc , @xmath1 varies up to a factor of @xmath4100 .",
    "the observed @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profiles show two characteristic features : a steep decrease of @xmath1 at small @xmath9 and a gradual increase of @xmath1 at large @xmath9 . among the five dark and star - forming regions , ic348 and",
    "b1e / b1 clearly show the transition from decreasing to increasing @xmath1 at @xmath9 @xmath4 3 mag .",
    "4 .   the modified w10 model with the `` core - halo '' density distribution",
    "reproduces the observed @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profiles , particularly well for ic348 and b1e / b1 .",
    "in addition , the model predicts a nearly constant @xmath2(hi ) @xmath4 9 @xmath5 10@xmath22 @xmath7 and a linear increase of @xmath29 with @xmath2(h ) , both consistent with what we find in perseus .",
    "the modified w10 model with the uniform density distribution reproduces the observed @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) reasonably well but underestimates @xmath2(hi ) by a factor of @xmath410160 . as a result ,",
    "the model overestimates @xmath29 for a given @xmath2(h ) by up to a factor of @xmath4300 .",
    "in addition , while matching the observed saturation of @xmath3 at @xmath9 @xmath11 3 mag , the model predicts a more gradual increase of @xmath3 at @xmath9 @xmath10 3 mag .",
    "this results in the @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profile shallower than the observations at @xmath9 @xmath10 3 mag .",
    "the scaled s11 model predicts @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) in excellent agreement with what we estimate in perseus .",
    "however , @xmath2(hi ) increases with @xmath2(h ) by a factor of @xmath47 in the model and this is in contrast with the observed small variation of @xmath2(hi ) with @xmath2(h ) ( less than a factor of 2 ) . while we do not compare specific @xmath3 values in the s11 model with the observed @xmath3 due to a complex issue of scaling @xmath3 for different line of sight depths , we stress that the simulated @xmath3 becomes comparable only when the co emission is integrated along the full simulation box of 20 pc , suggesting that the model likely underestimates @xmath3 for the conditions relevant to perseus . in addition , we find that the s11 model reproduces the observed shapes of @xmath3 vs @xmath9 and @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profiles reasonably well but with a large scatter particulary at small @xmath9 .",
    "our study shows that @xmath1 can vary by up to a factor of @xmath4100 on @xmath40.4 pc scales and depends on local ism conditions such as @xmath47 , @xmath88 , @xmath37 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the characteristic relation of @xmath1 with @xmath9 is mainly driven by how @xmath3 varies with @xmath9 . at small",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath1 steeply decreases with @xmath9 , likely because co becomes sufficiently shielded against photodissociation and @xmath3 sharply increases .",
    "@xmath1 then gradually increases with @xmath9 , likely due to the saturation of @xmath3 .",
    "our results observationally confirm previous theoretical predictions of the @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profile for the first time .",
    "however , the precise details of the @xmath1 vs @xmath9 profile , e.g. , the location where the transition from decreasing to increasing @xmath1 occurs , the slopes of the decreasing and increasing portions , etc . ,",
    "again depend on local environmental parameters ( e.g. , taylor et al . 1993 ;",
    "bell et al . 2006 ; shetty et al .",
    "in general , our results suggest that a single @xmath1 can not be used to derive the spatial distribution of @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) across a molecular cloud .",
    "the detailed comparison between our high - resolution data and theory provides important insights into h@xmath0 and co formation in molecular clouds .",
    "for example , the good agreement we found with the modified w10 model suggests that the steady state and equilibrium chemistry and the microturbulent approximation for co spectral line formation and cooling work well for perseus on @xmath40.4 pc scales .",
    "perseus appears to be old enough to achieve chemical equilibrium and the timescale of the dynamical process(es ) most revelant for the formation of molecular gas is likely @xmath11 3 myr .",
    "however , the good agreement with the model is achieved only if the density distribution has a diffuse halo component . in the modified w10 model ,",
    "the halo provides dust shielding against h@xmath0 and co photodissociation and is essential to reproduce the observed @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath29 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 distributions .",
    "while our results indicate the importance of the diffuse hi halo for the distributions of two most abundant molecular species , h@xmath0 and co , the properties of the halo have not been observationally well constrained . despite the lack of fine - tuning to match the characteristics of perseus , the s11 model reproduces the observed @xmath2(hi ) , @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath3 properties reasonably well .",
    "in particular , the predicted range of @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) in the scaled s11 model is in excellent agreement with our data .",
    "these results suggest that the time - dependent chemistry model is generally consistent with the time - independent chemistry model for a low - mass , old molecular cloud such as perseus .",
    "however , there are several interesting discrepancies and they likely result from the nature of turbulence in the s11 model . the strong compressions and rarefactions by turbulence could result in the wider range of @xmath2(hi ) in the s11 model and unlike the modified w10 model , there is no minimum @xmath2(hi ) beyond which the rest of hydrogen is fully converted into h@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , density fluctuations in the s11 model allow the formation of dense clumps even at small @xmath9 and potentially result in a large scatter of @xmath3 .",
    "turbulent motions could mix and spread the co distribution , likely contributing to the scatter of @xmath3 .",
    "our future studies of other galactic molecular clouds , in particular those clouds much less evolved and/or forming more massive stars ( therefore more turbulent ) than perseus , will be important for comprehensive tests of the pdr and mhd models .",
