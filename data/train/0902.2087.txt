    "the @xmath1-ray emission from highly beamed relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) most likely originates near the base of the jet where the energetics are strongest @xcite .",
    "high - resolution imaging of this region is therefore critical for understanding the mechanism by which high energy radiation is generated .",
    "arguments based on size limits deduced from time variability and the cross section for pair production suggest that the @xmath1-ray emission , like the radio emission , is doppler boosted @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1-rays may be even more strongly beamed than the radio emission , since the former generally have a steeper spectral index @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) , and the boosting factor is proportional to @xmath5 for continuous jets . also , @xcite has shown that if the bulk of the @xmath1-rays are produced by external compton scattering off photons associated with the accretion disk , then the resulting @xmath1-ray emission will be boosted by an additional factor of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath1-ray loud agns do indeed have systematically high doppler factors , then we might also expect them to have a distinct apparent speed distribution , since both of these properties depend on the lorentz factor and viewing angle of the jet .",
    "indeed , monte carlo simulations based on a simple linear relationship between radio and @xmath1-ray luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirm that in a flux - density - limited radio sample , agn jets with measurable @xmath1-ray emission above a fixed sensitivity limit should have typically higher speeds than those that are not detected in @xmath1-rays .",

    "@xcite reported no difference in the morphology of agn jets with and without observed @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "however , using the 2 cm radio data obtained with the nrao s very long baseline array ( vlba ) , @xcite found that the radio jets of @xmath1-ray sources appear to have more compact structure than non-@xmath1-ray sources , while @xcite used multiepoch 2 cm vlba data to show that egret @xmath1-ray sources have marginally higher jet speeds than non-@xmath1-ray sources . also , @xcite obtained 7 mm and 1.3 cm multiepoch vlba observations of 33 @xmath1-ray blazars between 1993 and 1997 and reported evidence that agns with observed @xmath1-ray emission have somewhat higher apparent speeds .",
    "@xcite claim an association between the time of @xmath1-ray flares with the ejection of new superluminal components , and that the @xmath1-ray event occurs within the jet features and not at the base of the jet .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath1-ray flaring preferentially takes place during the rising or peak period of the high - frequency radio flares .",
    "these egret - based results are consistent with models where the @xmath1-ray sources have more highly relativistic jets and are aligned closer to the line of sight .    however , these earlier findings were based on the somewhat limited and inhomogeneous @xmath1-ray data set obtained by the egret detector on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ , with its small number statistics , limited sensitivity , and large position uncertainties , as well as uncertainties introduced by the frequently changing @xmath1-ray catalog lists ( @xcite ) . thus , it was often ambiguous whether @xmath1-ray emission was detected as a result of a flaring event , or was merely the result of a prescheduled pointed observation , even if the @xmath1-ray and radio sources were clearly associated .    with the beginning of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) operations in 2008 august @xcite , @xmath1-ray observations with greatly improved sensitivity and time sampling",
    "are now available for a large sample of agns .",
    "these data make it possible to recognize and study @xmath1-ray flaring activity with a time resolution of days . at the same time , the continuation and extension of the mojave vlba program is measuring the velocity and ejection epochs for bright features in over 200 relativistic jets associated with bright radio - loud agns @xcite .    in this letter , we discuss the parsec - scale jet kinematic properties of agns in the radio - flux - limited mojave sample that are associated with bright @xmath1-ray sources detected during the first three months of lat all - sky survey observations .",
    "the latter are @xmath8 detections from the bright @xmath1-ray source list as reported by @xcite .",
    "the association of these sources with agns ( the lat bright agn sample : lbas ) is discussed by @xcite .",
    "since the lbas is not a uniform , flux - limited list of lat @xmath1-ray detections , the goal of our investigation presented here is mainly to identify general trends in the preliminary @xmath1-ray data .",
    "a more detailed and thorough study will be made at the time of the one - year _ fermi _ data release , which will contain a uniform all - sky catalog and @xmath1-ray energy spectra of all lat - detected sources .",
    "our analysis focuses on the observed mojave jet speeds of the lbas sources , their redshift , and optical classifications , and how these factors influence their observed @xmath1-ray flux . in an accompanying _ letter _",
    "@xcite , we report on the correlation of @xmath1-ray flux with quasi - simultaneous parsec - scale radio flux density , radio jet compactness , and overall jet activity level during the three - month initial lat observation period . a full report on the jet kinematics of all 135 sources in the flux - density - limited complete mojave sample",
    "will be presented by @xcite .",
    "we use a lambda cold dtark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) cosmology with @xmath10  kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the mojave program @xcite and its predecessor , the vlba 2 cm survey @xcite , have been monitoring the parsec - scale jet kinematics of the brightest compact extragalactic radio jets in the northern sky since 1994 .",
    "the full monitoring sample currently comprises over 200 agns , and includes a statistically complete , flux - density - limited subsample of all 135 sources above j2000 declination @xmath14 having vlba correlated ( i.e. , compact ) flux density above 1.5jy ( 2jy for sources south of declination @xmath15 ) . to account for the variable nature of blazars",
    ", the flux density limit applies to a 10-year time period from 1994.0 to 2004.0 , i.e. , all agns that were known to exceed this limit during this time range are included . for the purposes of this discussion , we will hereafter refer to this subsample as the mojave sample .",
    "details of the extensive database search that we conducted to ensure the completeness of the mojave sample are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that the mojave sample is selected on the basis of relativistically beamed , compact jet emission at centimeter - wavelengths makes it less prone to obscuration effects that can bias other blazar surveys .",
    "a detailed study of selection biases by @xcite suggests that this type of large , radio - selected sample should contain many of the fastest jets in the parent population , since the latter can have very high doppler boosting factors ( up to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bulk flow lorentz factor ) for favorable viewing angles .",
    "this doppler orientation bias ensures that the mojave sample is composed primarily of jets having high-@xmath17 and low - viewing angles ( i.e. , flat - spectrum radio quasars and bllac objects ) .",
    "its high blazar fraction and large sky area coverage therefore make it a very useful sample for comparing the radio and @xmath1-ray properties of agn jets .",
    "although the mojave sample contains 135 agns with declinations above @xmath18 , 12 sources lie in the galactic plane region ( @xmath19 ) that is excluded from the lbas list . for the purposes of our analysis",
    ", we will omit these agns from the mojave sample . of the remaining 123 mojave sources , 30 are in the lbas list ( including one low - confidence source listed by @xcite ) , which corresponds to an overall @xmath1-ray detection rate of @xmath20 .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to these lbas - mojave sources as the lm subset ( see table 1 for a summary of sample descriptions ) .",
    "the lm sources are listed in table 2 , and include 19 out of 94 mojave quasars ( 20% ) , 10 out of 21 bllac objects ( 48% ) , and 1 out of six radio galaxies ( 17% ) .",
    "neither of the two optically unidentified mojave sources are in the lbas list . from a @xmath1-ray sample perspective ,",
    "19 out of 41 lbas quasars ( 46% ) and 10 out of 31 lbas bllac objects ( 32% ) north of declination @xmath14 and with @xmath7 are members of the mojave sample .",
    "the only lbas radio galaxy north of declination @xmath14 is a mojave source ( ngc1275 ) .    for 26 of these 30 bright lm sources , we have measured parsec - scale apparent jet speeds by tracking moving features in vlba images over periods of several years . in the case of two sources ,",
    "no redshift information is available ; another two were either too compact or show complicated jet kinematics that could not be adequately measured by mojave .",
    "we have found that in most jets , the various features typically move with similar but somewhat different speeds @xcite . for our analysis",
    ", we use the fastest robust speed measured in a given jet , which we consider to be most representative of the speed of the underlying jet flow .",
    "the speeds in table  2 represent the fastest feature in each jet whose motion was determined to be radially outward from the base of the jet and did not show appreciable acceleration .",
    "a few isolated jets had no features that met these criteria ; in these cases a mean speed from a simple accelerating fit model @xcite was used .",

    "this effect is understood to be the result of a higher detection efficiency of the lat for sources with harder @xmath1-ray spectra , which is a known characteristic of bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the redshift distributions of lbas quasars and bllac objects show two well - separated peaks , with the bllacs peaking at small redshifts ( @xmath22 ) and the quasars peaking around @xmath23 . the radio - selected mojave sample , on the other hand ,",

    "thus , there is a substantially lower lat detection rate for the mojave quasars with the slowest jet speeds .",
    "the statistics for the bl lac objects are more sparse , and the k - s test indicates no significant difference in the lm and non - lm mojave speeds",
    ". however , the speed distributions of the lm bl lacs and lm quasars are significantly different , ( 0.3% k - s probability of having the same parent distribution ) , with medians of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the lbas list presented by @xcite also includes information on which agns have displayed significant @xmath1-ray variability ( @xmath33 ) over the initial three - month lat observation period .",
    "we find that the @xmath1-ray variable lm sources exhibit faster jet speeds ( median = @xmath32 ) than the nonvariable ones ( median = @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : latspeedsvariable ] ) .",
    "a k - s test gives a probability of 9.4% that the speed distributions are similar .",
    "if only quasars and bl lacs are considered , this value becomes 5% .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "a high apparent speed measurement ( @xmath36 , in units of @xmath2 ) in an agn jet implies a minimum lorentz factor of @xmath37 and sets an upper limit @xmath38 on the viewing angle .",
    "the median lbas quasar speed of @xmath32 thus corresponds to jet viewing angles within @xmath39 of the line of sight .",
    "since the observed flaring properties of agns are expected to depend strongly on jet speed and viewing angle @xcite , the trend of @xmath1-ray variable lbas sources having even higher speeds ( median = @xmath28 , @xmath40 ) is consistent with earlier egret findings ( e.g. , @xcite ) that these blazars have preferentially higher doppler boosting factors .",
    "while large doppler boosting factors by themselves may be directly responsible for the observed correlations , there may be an additional dependence of intrinsic @xmath1-ray luminosity on the bulk lorentz factor of the jet or rest - frame viewing angle , as both of these quantities are also closely tied to the apparent superluminal speed .    the relatively low @xmath1-ray detection rate of the mojave blazar sample in the first three months of lat operations ( 24% ) would indeed suggest that doppler boosting is not the sole factor in determining whether a particular agn is bright at @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "for example , only 16 of the 37 mojave agns that were high - confidence or probable egret associations according to the references cited in section  1 are in the lbas list .",
    "since we would not expect the doppler factors of these jets to change significantly in the intervening time period , this suggests that additional factors are involved .    in an accompanying letter ,",
    "@xcite we report that the lm jets tend to be in a relatively active state , as determined by their jet core compactness and radio luminosity levels .",
    "many agns also appear to have been detected by the lat by virtue of their proximity ( e.g. , the radio galaxy ngc 1275 ) , or their spectral energy distribution ( i.e. , the bl lac objects ) .",
    "the slower apparent jet speeds and fainter vlba radio luminosities of the bl lac objects suggest that they must have higher intrinsic ( unbeamed ) @xmath1-ray to radio luminosity ratios than other blazars , in order to account for their higher lat - detection rate",
    ". this can be more fully investigated when the lat photon energy spectra become available .",
    "we have examined the parsec - scale jet kinematics of a subset of 30 agns from the flux - limited mojave vlba radio sample that were detected during the first three months of _ fermi _ lat observations at energies greater than 100 mev .",
    "although the lat three - month bright agn source list is not a complete flux - limited @xmath1-ray survey , we have identified several trends that merit further investigation with the full one - year _ fermi _ data set :    \\(1 ) the fraction of mojave agns detected by the lat in its first three months of operations ( 30 of 123 = 24% ) is comparable to the fraction detected by egret during its mission lifetime ( 37 of 123 = 30% ) .",
    "only 16 of these agns were detected by both @xmath1-ray telescopes .",
    "\\(5 ) the lm bl lacs have lower redshifts and a slower median jet speed ( 6 c ) than the lm quasars ( @xmath32 ) , yet their fractional lat detection rate is much higher ( 48% vs. 20% ) .",
    "this is likely because they have higher intrinsic @xmath1-ray to radio luminosity ratios than the mojave quasars .",
    "although these results are generally consistent with earlier findings based on nonuniform egret data that @xmath1-ray blazars tend to have preferentially higher doppler boosting factors , our results taken together with those of @xcite further indicate that the spectral energy shape and current radio jet activity level are also important factors in determining whether a particular agn is visible at @xmath1-ray energies .",
