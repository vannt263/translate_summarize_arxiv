    "most epidemic models incorporate a homogeneous mixing assumption , sometimes called the law of mass action  @xcite , whereby the rate of increase in epidemic incidence is proportional to the product of the number of infectious and the number of susceptible individuals .",
    "this assumption has been relaxed in some compartmental  @xcite and meta - population models  @xcite , but not eliminated .",
    "the mass action assumption is robust in the sense that it is consistent with several scenarios for the individual - to - individual transmission of disease . in particular",
    ", it is equivalent to a model in which all individuals in a population make contact at an identical rate and have identical probabilities of disease transmission to those contacts per unit time .",
    "although this assumption is unrealistic , it facilitates mathematical analysis and , in some cases , offers a reasonable approximation .",
    "populations can be quite heterogeneous with respect susceptibility , infectiousness , contact rates , or number of partners , and simple homogeneous mixing models do not allow for extreme variation in host parameters .",
    "new network - based mathematical methods capture some , but not all , aspects of population heterogeneity  @xcite .",
    "ideally , an epidemic model would incorporate the following realities of human - to - human contacts :    * a given individual has contact with only a finite number of other individuals in the population at any one time , and contacts which can result in disease - transmission are usually short and repeated events .",
    "* the number and frequency of contacts between individuals can be very heterogeneous . *",
    "the numbers and identities of an individual s contacts will change as time goes by .",
    "the first two points have been addressed previously by static network models  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the third point , and introduce a modeling framework that allows an individual s contacts to change in time .",
    "concurrent and serial contacts were first shown to be important to hiv transmission dynamics in  @xcite , and have been modeled using high - dimensional pair - approximation methods  @xcite and moment closure methods on dynamic contact networks  @xcite . here , we introduce a low - dimensional system of non - linear odes to model susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemics in a simple class of dynamic networks .",
    "we use this model to characterize the impacts of population heterogeneity and contact rates on epidemic dynamics .",
    "we show further that the model reproduces basic classes of epidemiological models , such as the standard mass - action sir model and static network model , as the parameter which controls population mixing varies .",
    "human contact patterns are potentially complex , as the numbers and intensity of contacts can vary considerably across a population .",
    "furthermore , contacts are transitory events such that the identities of one s contacts change in time .",
    "to capture such heterogeneity , we introduce the _ neighbor - exchange _ ( ne ) model as a simple extension of a static contact network model . in this model ,",
    "an individual s number of concurrent contacts remains fixed while the composition of those contacts changes at a specified rate .",
    "the model assumes that at any given time , an individual will be in contact with an individual - specific number of neighbors with whom disease transmission is possible .",
    "each contact is temporary , lasting a variable amount of time before coming to end , at which point the neighbor is replaced by a different individual .",
    "let the population of interest consist of @xmath0 individuals , each of which falls into one of three exclusive states : susceptible , infectious , or recovered . at some time @xmath1",
    ", an individual @xmath2 will have @xmath3 contacts with other individuals ( i.e. , _ alters _ ) : @xmath4 .",
    "only undirected contact networks will be considered such that if there exists a contact @xmath5 there will also be a contact @xmath6 . in network terminology a directed link , denoted @xmath7 , is called an _",
    "arc_. an undirected link , denoted @xmath8 , is called an _ edge_.",
    "the _ degree _ of a node @xmath2 is the number of edges connected to the node .",
    "the term _ contact _ will specifically be used to denote a directed arc in the network , where two arcs correspond to each undirected edge .",
    "the _ k - degree _ of a node will be the number of concurrent contacts to / from the node .",
    "the neighbor exchange model assumes that the identities of a node s neighbors will continually change while the total number of current neighbors remains constant .",
    "this occurs through an exchange mechanism in which the destination nodes of two edges are swapped .",
    "for example , two nodes @xmath2 and @xmath9 with distinct contacts @xmath5 and @xmath10 may exchange contacts such that these are replaced with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are two edges and four contacts involved in each edge - swap .",
    "the fate of each edge and contact is summarized in the following pseudo - chemical equation : @xmath13 in the model , any given contact @xmath5 will be reassigned to @xmath11 at a constant rate @xmath14 .",
    "equivalently , edges are swapped at a rate @xmath15 .",
    ".notation for epidemic and network parameters . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     all of the results that follow will assume that a very small fraction @xmath16 of nodes are initially infected , and thus there is only a very small probability that two initially infected individuals contact each other .",
    "then we anticipate the following initial conditions  @xcite : @xmath17      in the limit of large mixing rate ( @xmath18 ) , the probability of being connected to a susceptible , infectious , or recovered node is directly proportional to the number of edges emanating from nodes in each state . referring to table  [ tab : netsir2 ] ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath19 converges instantly to @xmath20 and @xmath21 converges instantly to @xmath22 . here",
    ", we show that , as the mixing rate grows , the underlying network structure becomes irrelevant and the model converges to a mass action model .    to see this , we replace every occurrence of the variable @xmath19 in the system of equations in table  [ tab : netsir2 ] with @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath23 and , @xmath24 neither equations  [ eqn : thetadotrm ] or  [ eqn : midotrm ] depend on @xmath21 , and thus together form a closed system of equations which describe the epidemic dynamics .",
    "these equations incorporate arbitrary heterogeneity in contact rates , but no longer consider an explicit contact network .",
    "when we assume that contact rates are homogeneous throughout the population , than these equations are equivalent to a simple sir compartmental model . to illustrate , we retrieve the standard sir dynamics by setting @xmath25 , which means that every node has exactly one concurrent contact . in such a population ,",
    "the number of arcs to infectious individuals is exactly equal to the number of infectious nodes , that is , @xmath26 .",
    "then , substituting into equations  [ eqn : thetadotrm ] and  [ eqn : midotrm ] , we reproduce the standard equations : @xmath27    equations  [ eqn : thetadotrm ] and  [ eqn : midotrm ] are potentially extremely useful , as they incorporate arbitrary heterogeneity in a system of equations no more complex than the standard compartmental sir model .",

    "we observe that the convergence is quite rapid as @xmath14 is increased in multiples of @xmath29 .",

    "prior network models have typically not taken into account the serial aspect of sexual contacts , and instead assume that all contacts reported in a survey are constant over the duration of an epidemic or infectious period . here",
    ", we illustrate that the dynamic sir network model ( table  [ tab : netsir2 ] ) can explicitly capture the transitory nature of sexual contact patterns .",
    "we use public - health data from an outbreak of syphilis within an adolescent community centered on an atlanta high - school  @xcite .",
    "initially , several adolescents diagnosed with syphilis were interviewed by epidemiologists .",
    "the sexual contacts of these respondents were then traced and interviewed . in all , 34 people were interviewed and 204 contacts were traced .",
    "each interviewee named their sexual contacts and listed the date of their first and last interaction with each contact .",
    "the complexity of syphilis transmission dynamics  @xcite and the small size of our data set make modeling the 1996 outbreak quite difficult .",
    "the following results should thus be taken with the caveat that there is significant uncertainty in the estimated rates and parameters , particularly the host transmission and recovery rates .",
    "below we will show the impact of these parameters on the expected final size of a syphilis epidemic .",
    "we estimate the relevant parameters using equations given in the supplement  @xcite and in  @xcite . in brief",
    ", a typical syphilis infection can last about a year if left untreated , and a typical infectious period will last 154 days on average  @xcite .",
    "a convenient estimate of the recovery rate is then @xmath62 .",
    "this estimate ignores many features of the pathology of syphilis for mathematical convenience , such as different probabilities of recovery at different stages of the infectious period  @xcite .",
    "there are diverse estimates for the transmissibility of syphilis , ranging from 9.2% to 63% per partner  @xcite .",
    "the estimate of 62.7% was selected as the most credible by the authors in  @xcite .    using the contact durations reported in the atlanta study , we estimate the mixing rate of the population to be @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "we then use the reported numbers of contacts to estimate @xmath64 , the average number of concurrent contacts for each individual @xmath2 in the sample .",

    "lighter colors correspond to larger final size , as given by the color bar on right .",
    "the thick black line corresponds to the ratio @xmath70 that gives the expected transmissibility of @xmath71 .",
    "the large data point indicates the expected recovery rate of @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : fshm ] ]    figure  [ fig : fshm ] shows the final size of an outbreak as predicted by the ne model over a broad range transmission and recovery rates .",
    "the black line ( upper left ) corresponds to the ratio of @xmath36 to @xmath29 that yields a transmissibility @xmath71 . if we suppose a transmissibility of 62.7% and a recovery rate of @xmath73 ( the white circle in figure  [ fig : fshm ] ) , the final size is expected to be 97% .",
    "this is not consistent with the observed outbreak or an estimated prevalence of 35%  @xcite . as figure  [ fig : fshm ] shows , however , slight alterations in @xmath36 or @xmath29 can drastically impact the predicted outbreak size . in particular , therapeutic intervention , which certainly occurred during the 1996 outbreak ,",
    "increases the effective recovery rate and thereby decreases the ultimate attack rate .",
    "therefore the estimate of 97% should be considered a worst - case scenario given the behavioral parameters ( mixing rate and degree distribution ) estimated for this adolescent population .",
    "human contact patterns are characterized by heterogeneous numbers of transitory contacts .",
    "if contacts change at a rate which is slow relative the rate of epidemic propagation , then static network approximations such as those based on bond - percolation  @xcite may be appropriate .",
    "on the other hand , if contacts have very short duration relative to epidemic dynamics , then static network approximations break down and a mass - action model is more appropriate ( equations  [ eqn : thetadotrm ] and  [ eqn : midotrm ] ) . in between these extremes , contacts are neither fixed nor instantaneous , and accurate epidemiological forecasting requires models that explicitly capture their dynamics , such as the ne model developed here .",
    "in fact , by changing a single parameter ( the mixing rate ) , the ne model crosses the spectrum of models from static network to mass - action .",
    "the ne model is particularly useful for building models from link - tracing data . for many data sets , standard mass action models do not adequately capture the finite number and extended - duration of contacts , while static network models ignore the transitory and serial nature of contacts .",
    "using the example of a 1996 syphilis outbreak in an adolescent population , we showed that the ne model can be easily fit to sexual contact data and then used to explore the epidemiological implications of host population structure .    in the limit of large mixing rate",
    ", the ne model becomes a simple ( low - dimensional ) mass - action model ( equations  [ eqn : thetadotrm ] and  [ eqn : midotrm ] ) that captures sir dynamics in populations with arbitrary heterogeneity of contact rates .",
    "it reduces to the standard mass - action model when one assumes that all individuals have the same number of contacts .",
    "the mass - action model could potentially find wide utility in populations which are heterogeneous with respect to contact rates , infectiousness or susceptibility , specifically for modeling highly contagious diseases ( such that brief contacts lead to transmission ) or slow - propagating infectious diseases ( such as many std s )  in either case , epidemic propagation is slow relative to the turnover in contacts .",
    "we check our mathematical results using simulations which model continuous - time stochastic processes ( both social and epidemiological ) and take into account the finite size and heterogeneity of the population ( section  [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "we wish to highlight our specific simulation techniques as an interesting alternative to the commonly used chain - binomial simulation  @xcite .",
    "the ne model offers a flexible starting point for analyzing epidemiological processes in dynamic networks .",
    "it should be fairly straightforward to extend the model to populations with simple spatial heterogeneity or assortative mixing by type  @xcite .",
    "modeling a dynamic population in which the number of concurrent contacts varies in time , however , will likely require a different approach .",
