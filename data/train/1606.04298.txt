    "cell adhesion processes and the adhesion of vesicles to the membranes of cells or organelles depend sensitively on the binding constant and binding kinetics of the membrane - anchored receptor and ligand molecules that mediate adhesion .",
    "since the binding equilibrium constant @xmath0 and the on- and off - rate constants of these receptor and ligand molecules are difficult to measure in their natural two - dimensional ( 2d ) membrane environment , a central question is how they are related to the binding equilibrium constant @xmath1 and the on- and off - rate constants of soluble variants of the receptors and ligands that lack the membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite .",
    "the binding constant @xmath1 and on- and off - rate constants of these soluble receptors and ligands can be quantified with standard experimental methods @xcite .",
    "the binding equilibrium constant @xmath0 of membrane - anchored receptor and ligand molecules has units of area , while the binding constant @xmath1 of soluble variants of these molecules has units of volume .",
    "bell and co - workers @xcite therefore suggested the relation @xmath2 between the binding constants with a characteristic confinement length @xmath3 that balances the different units of these constants .",
    "however , experimental data for @xmath0 and @xmath1 of several receptor and ligand pairs lead to values of the confinement length @xmath3 that can differ by orders of magnitude , depending on whether @xmath0 is determined with fluorescence methods or with mechanical methods @xcite .",
    "fluorescence methods @xcite probe the binding equilibrium of receptors and ligands in equilibrated adhesion zones of cells and lead to values of @xmath3 of the order of nanometers . in contrast , mechanical methods @xcite probe the binding kinetics of anchored receptors and ligands during initial contacts and typically lead to values of @xmath3 between tens of micrometers and millimeters in cell adhesion experiments @xcite .    in this article , we review recent results from computational model systems and theory that provide general and novel insights into the relation between the binding equilibrium and kinetics of membrane - anchored receptor and ligand molecules in 2d and the binding of soluble variants of these molecules in 3d .",
    "a central aspect of these computational and theoretical results is that the relation between the binding equilibrium constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 involves four characteristic lengths , rather than a single confinement length @xcite .",
    "two of these four lengths are characteristic lengths of the receptor - ligand complex that reflect variations in the binding site , and how strongly the local membrane separation at the location of the complex is constrained by the complex .",
    "the remaining two lengths are the average separation and relative roughness of the apposing membranes and , thus , characteristic lengths of the membranes . the relative membrane roughness is the local standard deviation of the membranes from their average separation due to thermally excited shape fluctuations on nanoscales .",
    "the binding equilibrium constant @xmath0 strongly depends both on the average membrane separation and the relative membrane roughness , which helps to understand why mechanical methods that probe the binding kinetics of membrane - anchored proteins during initial membrane contacts can lead to values for @xmath0 that are orders of magnitude smaller than the values obtained from fluorescence measurements in equilibrated adhesion zones @xcite . in equilibrated adhesion zones that are dominated by a single species of receptors and ligands ,",
    "the average membrane separation is close to the preferred average separation for receptor - ligand binding at which @xmath0 is maximal , and the relative membrane roughness is reduced by receptor - ligand bonds @xcite . during initial membrane contacts , in contrast ,",
    "both the average membrane separation and relative membrane roughness are larger , which can lead to significantly smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "a membrane - anchored receptor can only bind to an apposing membrane - anchored ligand if the local membrane separation @xmath4 at the site of the receptor and ligand is within an appropriate range .",
    "this local separation @xmath4 of the membranes varies  along the membranes , and in time  because of thermally excited membrane shape fluctuations .",
    "experiments that probe the binding equilibrium constant @xmath0 or the on- and off - rate constants",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 imply averages in space and time over membrane adhesion regions and measurement durations .",
    "our recent simulations and theories indicate that these averages can be expressed as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the binding equilibrium constant and on - rate constant as functions of the local membrane separation @xmath4 , and @xmath10 is the distribution of local membrane separations that reflects the spatial and temporal variations of @xmath4 .",
    "the single - peaked functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are maximal the at preferred local separation of the receptors and ligands for binding , and have characteristic widths that depend on the anchoring , length , and flexibility of the receptors and ligands @xcite .",

    "a fourth characteristic length that affects the relation of the binding constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 in our theory is the ratio @xmath18 of the translational space phase volume @xmath19 of a bound soluble receptor in 3d and the translational phase space area @xmath20 of a bound membrane - anchored receptor in 2d , relative to their ligands ( see section iv ) .",

    "in contrast , the overall shape of cells on length scales of micrometers is dominated by the membrane tension and the cell cytoskeleton .",
    "the bending energy dominates over the membrane tension @xmath29 on length scales smaller than the crossover length @xmath30 , which adopts values of 100 or a few 100 nanometers for typical values of the bending rigidity @xmath31 and tension @xmath29 of cell membranes @xcite .",
    "if the relative membrane roughness @xmath17 is much smaller than the widths @xmath15 and @xmath21 of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the binding of membrane - anchored receptors and ligands is only weakly affected by @xmath17 .",
    "such situations may occur in focal contacts or adherens junctions , which consist of clusters of integrin and cadherin complexes , respectively @xcite .",
    "in cell adhesion zones of immune cells and in the equilibrated adhesion zones probed with fluorescence methods @xcite , in contrast , the relative membrane roughness is likely of the same order or larger than @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "the computational model systems and theory described in the next sections indicate that the binding equilibrium and kinetics of the membrane - anchored receptors and ligands is then strongly affected both by the relative membrane roughness @xmath17 and the average membrane separation @xmath16 .",
    "if the relative membrane roughness @xmath17 is significantly larger than @xmath15 and @xmath21 , the binding equilibrium constant @xmath0 and on - rate constant @xmath5 are both inversely proportional to @xmath17 at the preferred average separation for binding @xcite . together with eq .",

    "an important aspect for the binding of membrane - anchored receptors and ligands is the flexibility of the membrane anchoring . in our computational model systems ,",
    "the anchoring flexibility of unbound membrane - anchored receptors and ligands can be described by the harmonic anchoring energy @xmath34 with anchoring strength @xmath35 and anchoring angle @xmath36 , which is the angle between the direction of the receptors and ligands and the local membrane normal .",
