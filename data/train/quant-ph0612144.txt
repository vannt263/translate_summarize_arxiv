    "since the proposal of s. bose @xcite for transferring quantum states via natural evolution of quantum spin one - half chains , there have been many types of extensions of this idea in various directions .",
    "for example it has been shown that perfect transfer is possible for a special class of hamiltonians , called mirror - periodic @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that one can achieve better fidelities either by using multiple chains @xcite or by allowing the parties to have access to more than one site of the chain @xcite or by using chains with longer range interaction than nearest neighbor @xcite .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations @xcite and decoherence @xcite have also been taken into account .",
    "some other aspects of this protocol have been studied in @xcite .",
    "+ however to our knowledge there has been no attempt to generalize this proposal to chains of particles of arbitrary spin .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend this proposal in this new and fundamental direction .",
    "there are good reasons why such an extension is worthwhile .",
    "first , until a particular experimental proposal for qubit quantum computer is widely accepted as the platform for implementation of quantum computers , we have to formulate various theoretical protocols for particles with arbitrary number of levels , the so - called qudits .",
    "in fact for this reason , various protocols of quantum computation and information , like cloning @xcite , cryptography @xcite and teleportation @xcite have been generalized to @xmath1- dimensional systems .",
    "second , from purely theoretical point of view we will learn very much in developing a particular scheme like quantum state transfer in a way such that the role of dimensionality can be studied in detail .",
    "in fact the work of bose @xcite can be rephrased in a way which demands such an extension in a quite natural way : it is well known that a quantum state can be transferred perfectly through a chain by sequential application of the swap operator defined as @xmath2 .",
    "however this method requires control on every qubit throughout the chain . instead in @xcite a state",
    "is coupled to left hand side of a spin one - half chain , governed by a ferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 s are the pauli operators , @xmath6 is the coupling constant and @xmath7 is the magnetic field .",
    "then the natural evolution of this chain will transfer the state to the right hand side , with a good fidelity provided that the state is extracted at an optimal time .",
    "this method can be named random swapping of a state .",
    "the reason is that using the identity @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the permutation operator ( @xmath2 ) , and a suitable redefinition of constants , @xmath10 can be rewritten as @xmath11 on the sector with fixed total spin @xmath12 , the evolution operator is equivalent to @xmath13 , where we have set @xmath14 and ignored an overall phase .",
    "thus for an infinitesimal time step @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 which shows that the state @xmath17 is obtained by adding to @xmath18 an equal superposition of states in which the spins of two adjacent sites have been swapped , hence the name random swapping .",
    "thus the result of @xcite can be rephrased in the following form : for qubits , random swapping achieves a fidelity which is reasonably good compared to that of sequential swapping ( for which @xmath19 ) . in particular when the length of the chain is 4 , the results of @xcite imply that sequential and random swapping attain almost equal fidelity . once interpreted in this way",
    ", we can ask naturally what form this comparison takes for states of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "+ we should note that the hamiltonian ( [ heis2 ] ) can always be expressed in terms of nearest - neighbor scalar spin interaction terms although in each dimension it takes a specific form , for example in dimension @xmath20 , it takes the form @xmath21 we will find that for a fixed distance , the fidelity decreases with dimension @xmath1 , but reaches a saturated value depending on the distance and when the sender and the receiver are 4 sites apart , nearly perfect transfer is possible for any dimension @xmath1 . as a by - product of our study",
    ", we will propose a much simpler method for state transfer , one in which the magnetic field is kept to a vanishingly small value , instead of tuning it to a distance - dependent value as in the original protocol of @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the basic protocol in @xmath1 dimensions , and derive the basic relations that we need in the sequel . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we study the problem of entanglement distribution in such chains . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "originally the problem of state transferring was considered for an open chain@xcite .",
    "however in that same work it was shown that in a ring of size @xmath22 one can as efficiently transfer states as in an open chain as long as the distance between the sender and the receiver is not longer than @xmath23 . to use the the advantage of simplicity of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , we consider a periodic chain of length @xmath23 , where each site comprises a state of a @xmath1 level system with basis states @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of the chain is governed by the hamiltonian , @xmath25 where the operator @xmath26 is the permutation operator on sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a diagonal operator acting on the states of site @xmath27 as , @xmath30 for @xmath31 note that @xmath12 , when shifted suitably , plays the role of the third component of the spin operator",
    ". thus @xmath7 plays the role of a magnetic field in the @xmath32direction .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) reduces to the heisenberg hamiltonian for spin @xmath33 states , and to the bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian for spin @xmath34 . for other spins",
    "it contains high power of the term @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is positive .",
    "+ the ground state of this hamiltonian is given by @xmath36 with energy @xmath37 .",
    "+ the reason is the following .",
    "since the permutation operator has the property @xmath38 , its eigenvalues are @xmath39 , and the operator @xmath40 will be a positive operator with eigenvalues @xmath41 and @xmath42 . therefore in the absence of magnetic field ,",
    "the hamiltonian , being a sum of positive operators , is positive and since the states @xmath43 , @xmath44 all have zero energy , they form the degenerate ground state of @xmath45 .",
    "the magnetic field only removes the degeneracy and lowers the energy of the state @xmath46 , with respect to others ( note that in our notation @xmath47 has the lowest value of spin component . )",
    "since the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath12 , and @xmath45 can be diagonlaized in sectors with fixed @xmath32 component of spin , this argument is valid for all values of the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "+ we should stress that in the absence of magnetic field , the phase diagram ( i.e. the character and long range order in the ground state ) of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , may be quite complicated .",
    "this will then affects crucially the quality of state transfer in such chains , a problem which has been recently investigated for spin 1 chains in @xcite . in the presence of magnetic field however",
    ", the ground state has a simple ferromagnetic order given by the ground state @xmath46 .",
    "+ let us denote a state in which the @xmath27-th site has been exited to the level @xmath48 by @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 the permutation operators in @xmath10 only displace this state through the chain and hence the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in each sector in which the number and type of excited local states is fixed .",
    "this is a consequence of a number of conservation laws , namely @xmath51=0 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "q^{(m)}:=\\sum_{i=1}^n(s_{z , i})^m\\ ] ] for @xmath52 in @xmath53 dimensions only the @xmath54 charge is conserved .",
    "these conservation laws imply for example that a state like , @xmath55 can not evolve to a state like @xmath56 , since although their @xmath54 charge are equal they have different @xmath57 charges . + the states with only one site excited",
    "are called one particle states and the subspace spanned by these vectors comprise the one - particle sector of the full hilbert space .",
    "let us denote by @xmath58 the one particle sector with @xmath54 charge equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the whole one particle sector is @xmath59 the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in @xmath60 with eigenvectors given by , @xmath61 with energy given by @xmath62 for quantum state transferring we can consider site @xmath63 as the sender of the system and site @xmath64 as a receiver .",
    "the initial state that should be sent is @xmath65 so the initial state of the system ( the site @xmath63 plus the chain ) is , @xmath66 in view of the fact that @xmath67 , the state at time @xmath68 will be , @xmath69 in deriving this formula we have used the fact that @xmath70=0 $ ] and the conservation laws which restricts the evolution to the one particle sector of fixed @xmath54 charges .",
    "we have also defined @xmath71 which is indeed independent of @xmath48 and hence can be taken outside the sum .",
    "the state of site @xmath64 which is acting as the receiver will be generally mixed , so is denoted by @xmath72 and is obtained by tracing out the other sites .",
    "@xmath73 rearrangement of the right hand side yields @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 alternatively we can say that the input state @xmath77 is mapped to the output state @xmath72 by the positive map @xmath78 where the so - called kraus operators @xmath79 are given by @xmath80 the fidelity between the received state @xmath72 and the initial state @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 which turns out to be @xmath83 in the sequel we should maximize this fidelity when it is uniformly averaged over the input states .",
    "the average is defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an invariant ( haar ) measure over the @xmath86 group , normalized such that @xmath87 .",
    "the reason for this choice of measure is as follows .",
    "let us fix a basis , like latexmath:[$\\{|0\\ra ,    @xmath47 and note that every arbitrary state @xmath89 can be obtained from @xmath47 by the action of a unitary operator @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 , for some non - unique @xmath92 .",
    "however , any two unitary matrices @xmath90 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 leaves @xmath47 invariant , lead to the same state @xmath89 . therefore a proper measure that prevents this multiple",
    "counting is a measure over @xmath95 .",
    "however since every state is multiply counted equally ( by a factor which is exactly the volume of the group @xmath96 ) , this does not affect the final averaging and we can use the simple measure over @xmath97 .",
    "invariance of this measure under left multiplication , i.e. @xmath98 guarantees uniformity of the measure over the space of all states . in two dimensions",
    "one can avoid multiple counting in a simple way , since in this case @xmath99 and therefore , one can use the measure over the 2 dimensional ( bloch ) sphere to count every state once .",
    "this is the measure used by bose in @xcite .",
    "+ for a @xmath0 dimensional normalized state @xmath100 an invariant measure yields trivially @xmath101 . to calculate the other averages we use @xmath102 and write @xmath103 where for the last equality",
    "we have used a result from @xcite on invariant integration on unitary groups .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath104 for @xmath105 . in view of the normalization of the state",
    ", we have @xmath106 thus we find @xmath107 using these results we can now calculate the average of fidelity over a uniform ensemble of input states .",
    "@xmath108 in order to write @xmath109 in a simple form we note that @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 . inserting these in ( [ avefid ] )",
    "we find that @xmath114 for @xmath53 we recover the formula of @xcite .",
    "+ it remains to calculate the explicit expression for the amplitudes @xmath115 .",
    "we note that @xmath116 for large @xmath23 , a closed formula for @xmath117 can be obtained by writing the right hand side as an integral .",
    "thus @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath120 .",
    "it now remains to follow a definite strategy for picking up the state at the destination point @xmath64 .",
    "as is clear from equation ( [ finalaveragefidelity ] ) , there is a distinctive difference between dimension @xmath53 and any other dimension , since in @xmath53 we have @xmath121 and the magnetic field enters only in one single term , namely the argument of cosine function .",
    "( note that we can always re - scale the other coupling constant @xmath122 to 1 . ) thus in @xmath53 there is rather a unique strategy , first suggested in @xcite : at any given time @xmath68 one finds the magnitude of @xmath123 which maximizes the cosine function to unity and then searches among the values of time @xmath68 to determine the optimal time @xmath124 for picking up the state .",
    "this will then determine the optimal value of the magnetic field through the relation @xmath125 note that since @xmath124 depends on the distance @xmath126 between the sender and the receiver , the optimal value of the magnetic field also depends on this distance .",
    "this is an inconvenient feature of this strategy .",
    "a by - product of the present work is that a much simpler strategy can be used , namely : tune the magnetic field to a vanishingly small value , then the optimal time for picking up the state is almost independent of the magnetic field . to see this we note that for higher values of @xmath1 , the magnetic field enters in two different ways in the final formula for the average fidelity , namely in the argument of the cosine function as in @xmath53 and in the function @xmath127",
    "these two functions may have incompatible properties so that they may not be maximized simultaneously .",
    "the latter function is maximized when its argument @xmath128 goes to zero , while the former function has a complicated dependence on @xmath68 and @xmath7 separately .",
    "thus one can follow two different strategies for picking up the states at point @xmath64 , the first one is exactly the same as in @xcite , explained above .",
    "we can also follow a second much simpler strategy , which has the advantage of no need for distance - dependent tuning of the magnetic field .",
    "we simply apply a vanishingly small magnetic field ( @xmath129 ) for all the times involved in the transfer process . on the other hand @xmath7 should not be vanishing so that we have a unique ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this maximizes the function @xmath127 to @xmath130 .",
    "we are now left with a function which is entirely a function of @xmath68 and can find for any distance @xmath126 , the optimal time and the maximum average fidelity .",
    "+ in figure ( 1 ) , we show the average fidelity for transferring @xmath131 and @xmath132 level states through half way distances in closed rings , using this strategy and compare it with the original bose strategy .",
    "thus when @xmath133 , we are using a ring of size @xmath134 .",
    "+ there are a few interesting features .",
    "first it is seen that the average fidelity is almost the same in both strategies , which implies that we can always , even for @xmath53 , use the second method which is much simpler and does not rely on distance - dependent tuning of magnetic fields .",
    "second we note that the strong similarity of the fidelity curves in various dimensions . to see the reason of this universality , we note that for very small magnetic fields , @xmath129 , where @xmath135 , the average fidelity behaves as    @xmath136    the curves in figure ( 1 ) show the fidelities at the optimal time @xmath137 where @xmath138 becomes a maximum , obtained by numerical searches in a time span @xmath139 .",
    "let us now suppose that the optimal time is the time where @xmath140 . since @xmath117 is independent of @xmath1 , we can obtain a universal relation for optimal fidelities from the above equation by rewriting it as follows .",
    "first we note from the above equation that @xmath141 rearranging the terms of ( [ finalaveragefidelity2 ] ) after setting @xmath142 , we find @xmath143 which is a constant . to check this assumption and the resulting universality ,",
    "we draw in figure ( 2 ) the left hand side of ( [ scaling ] ) ( as obtained from numerical searches for the optimal time , leading to figure ( 1 ) and not by setting @xmath144 ) for several values of @xmath1 .",
    "the universal behavior is now completely evident .",
    "+ finally , we note that almost perfect state transfer of any @xmath0 level state is possible when @xmath145 .",
    "this possibility of almost perfect state transfer was first noticed in @xcite for @xmath53 level states .",
    "we now see that this is a general and curious feature of random swapping for any @xmath0 level state . we know that by sequential swapping at any two consecutive sites , one can perfectly transfer an unknown state through a chain .",
    "however this requires a multitude of control operations at all sites of the chain .",
    "the above result about perfect transfer over distances of @xmath146 sites by random swapping ( induced by the natural hamiltonian dynamics ) , means that one can transfer states perfectly over long distances in a chain by a smaller number of control operations , namely by 1/4 of the number of sites of the chain .",
    "+    [ fig01 ]   and @xmath132 level states for two different strategies explained in the text . in each case",
    "the distance between the sender ( s ) and the receiver ( r ) is half the length of the chain ( n ) .",

    "one of the major problems of quantum information science and technology is the distribution of entangled pairs over long distances . for flying qubits , such pairs in the form of polarization - entangled photons",
    "have been distributed to various long distances through optical fibres and free air @xcite . for small distances in a quantum computer ,",
    "for which we supposedly will be dealing with solid state devices or ion traps in the future , one needs to distribute entangled pairs through such chains of qubits . in @xcite",
    "a method was proposed for such a task , when the particles have spin @xmath33 or have two levels ( qubits ) . here",
    "we generalize this idea to @xmath0 level states or qudits .",
    "we will see here that the quality of entanglement transfer is better for higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "+ suppose that a maximally entangled state is prepared between sites @xmath41 ( not coupled to the chain ) and site @xmath63 of the chain .",
    "we want to use the natural dynamics of the chain to transfer this entanglement through the chain .",
    "in particular we want to see what will be the entanglement between sites @xmath41 and @xmath64 at time @xmath68 .",
    "the initial states is @xmath150 at time @xmath68 , the joint state of sites @xmath41 and @xmath64 can be determined by the extension of the map ( [ krausdec ] ) to one acting on the chain and the external site @xmath41 : @xmath151 insertion of the kraus operators @xmath152s from ( [ krausdec ] ) in ( [ kraus_en ] ) gives , @xmath153 we use logarithmic negativity ( ln ) @xcite as a measure of entanglement of the state @xmath154 which is defined as , @xmath155 where by the superscript @xmath156 , the partial trace over the second space is implied .",
    "logarithmic negativity is an entanglement monotone which is additive and does not increase on the average under all partial transpose preserving operations @xcite . for a pure maximally entangled state like ( [ maxen ] ) , equation ( [ ln ] ) yields @xmath157 .",
    "+ in order to calculate logarithmic negativity we need eigenvalues of @xmath158 .",
    "straightforward calculations shows that @xmath159 it is readily seen that this operator is the direct sum of two - dimensional matrices of the form @xmath160 in the subspaces spanned by @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( with eigenvalues @xmath163 ) and a diagonal matrix spanned by the rest of basis vectors .",
    "putting these together we find the spectrum of the matrix @xmath164 as follows , @xmath165 where the number in front of each eigenvalue denotes its degeneracy .",
    "therefore the logarithmic negativity of the final state between sites @xmath41 and @xmath64 can be computed easily . it is found that @xmath166 and because @xmath167 is independent of @xmath48 so we can simplify the above formula,@xmath168 .",
    "this equation shows that with increasing @xmath1 the logarithmic negativity and hence the entanglement increases and indeed approaches its maximum value for continuous variable states .",
    "we can define the efficiency of entanglement distribution as a measure of the the percentage of entanglement that is gained after distribution of the maximally entangled state through the chain , so we introduce the efficiency as , @xmath169 figure ( 4 ) shows the efficiency of entanglement of sites @xmath34 and @xmath170 in a ring of size @xmath171 as a function of time for three different values of @xmath1 .

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=302 ]    it is seen that the optimal time for picking up the states is independent of @xmath1 and the efficiency is increased by increasing the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we have generalized the protocol of @xcite for quantum stater state transfer of qubits to transfer of @xmath1-level states . on the theoretical side",
    ", we can consider the results of @xcite and the present paper as an answer to the question `` with what fidelity can a quantum state be transferred through a chain if we use random swapping instead of sequential swapping ? '' .",
    "the latter method is known to achieve unit fidelity but requires local control at every site of the chain .",
