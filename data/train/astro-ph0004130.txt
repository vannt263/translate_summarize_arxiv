    "the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller area ( @xmath2 225 deg@xmath0 ) but much deeper survey in the southern galactic hemisphere ( gunn & weinberg 1995 , york _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .",
    "the flux densities of detected objects are measured almost simultaneously in five bands ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xcite ) with effective wavelengths of 3540   , 4760   , 6280   , 7690   , and 9250   , complete to limiting ( 5:1 signal - to - noise ) point source magnitudes of 22.3 , 23.3 , 23.1 , 22.3 , and 20.8 in the north galactic cap and @xmath12 because the absolute calibration of the sdss photometric system is still uncertain at the @xmath13 level .",
    "the sdss filters themselves are referred to as @xmath14 and @xmath11 .",
    "all magnitudes are given on the ab@xmath15 system ( oke & gunn , 1983 ; for additional discussion regarding the sdss photometric system see @xcite and fan 1999 ) . ] .",
    "the survey sky coverage of about @xmath16 steradians will result in photometric measurements to the above detection limits for about 10@xmath17 stars .",
    "the pixel size ( 0.4 arcsec ) and optical quality of the telescope are such that the resolution is limited by atmospheric seeing .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to about 0.1 arcsec for sources brighter than 20.5@xmath18 , and the morphological and color information from the images allows robust star - galaxy separation to @xmath2 21.5@xmath18 .    the survey is being done with a dedicated , special - purpose 2.5 meter telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has a wide well - corrected field ( 3 deg ) and is equipped with a large mosaic ccd camera and a pair of fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "the camera utilizes thirty large - area ( 2048 x 2048 ) ccds ( @xcite , doi _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) which take the data in drift - scanning ( time - delay - and - integrate , or tdi ) mode with a total integration time of 54.1 s. the imaging data are obtained using the data acquisition system at the apache point observatory ( petravick _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , annis _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) and recorded on dlt tapes .",
    "these tapes are shipped to fermilab by express courier and the data are automatically reduced through a set of software pipelines operating in a common computing environment ( kent _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . the photometric pipeline ( @xcite )",
    "reduces the imaging data , measuring positions , magnitudes , and shape parameters for all detected objects .",
    "the photometric pipeline uses position calibration information from the astrometric pipeline ( @xcite ) and photometric calibration data from the photometric telescope ( smith _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , uomoto _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , reduced through the photometric telescope pipeline ( tucker _ et al .",
    "final calibrations are applied by the final calibration pipeline which allows refinements in the positional and photometric calibration to be applied as the survey progresses .",
    "the outputs , together with all the observing and processing information , are loaded into the operational data base ( yanny _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) , which is the central repository of scientific and bookkeeping data used to run the survey .",
    "about 40% of the sky in the northern survey will be surveyed twice ( because of the scan overlaps ) , and all of the southern survey dozens of times ( to search for variable objects and , by stacking the frames , to go deeper ) .",
    "although two observations are normally insufficient to characterize a variable object , the multi - color nature of the photometric data helps enormously .",
    "close to 1000 square degrees of sky along the celestial equator have been observed during the sdss commissioning phase ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "about 100 deg@xmath0 of sky have been observed more than once ; we use these data to search for variable objects . in this paper",
    "we describe the detection and analysis of @xmath2 150 variable objects , probably rr lyrae stars .",
    "detecting rr lyrae stars is important for galactic structure studies because :    * they are believed to be an unbiased tracer of the low - metallicity halo population for kinematic studies ( @xcite ) , * they are nearly standard candles ( @xmath19 = 0.7 @xmath20 0.1 , @xcite ) and thus it is straightforward to determine their distance , and * they are sufficiently bright to be detected at large distances ( @xmath2 100 kpc for @xmath9 @xmath2 21@xmath18 ) and are thus especially well - suited for studies of the outer halo ( @xcite ) .    for a comprehensive review of rr lyrae stars we refer the reader to smith ( 1996 ) .    wetterer & mcgraw ( 1996 ) recently compiled data from several available deep searches for rr lyrae stars in the outer galactic halo .",
    "they pointed out that there are only nine rr lyrae stars discovered at galactocentric distances larger than 30 kpc , and only a few more have been found since then ( e.g. margon & deutsch 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "this paper presents a sample of candidate rr lyrae stars with 81 stars estimated to be at such distances .",
    "the following section describes the selection procedure used in the search for candidate rr lyrae stars  and the resulting sample .",
    "we analyze the galactic distribution of selected stars in  3 , and compare the sample to two other surveys of variable stars in  4 .",
    "we utilize imaging data from four runs ( 77 , 745 , 752 , and 756 ) obtained during the sdss commissioning phase .",
    "the data were obtained in six parallel scanlines , each 13.5 arcmin wide , along the celestial equator ( @xmath21 dec @xmath22 ) .",
    "the seeing in all runs was variable between 1 and 2 arcsec ( fwhm ) with the median value typically 1.5 arcsec .",
    "runs 745 and 756 , which are used as the main data set , were taken 1.9946 days apart on march 20 and 22 , 1999 .",
    "their overlap extends from ra = 10@xmath23 42@xmath18 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) to ra = 15@xmath23 46@xmath18 ( @xmath26=7.3@xmath27 , @xmath28=40.2@xmath27 ) and covers 97.5 deg@xmath0 of sky ( all coordinates are given as j2000 ) .    as auxiliary control data sets we use overlaps between runs 77 and 745 ( 33.7 deg@xmath0 ) , 77 and 756 ( 20.5 deg@xmath0 ) , and 752 and 756 ( 11.1 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "the ra ranges for these overlaps are summarized in table 1 .",
    "run 77 was obtained on june 27 , 1998 and provides a @xmath29 month ( 266 and 268 days ) baseline when compared to runs 745 and 756 .",
    "run 752 was obtained on march 21 , 1999 and provides a baseline of 0.9976 days when combined with run 756 .",
    "the overlap between runs 752 and 756 perpendicular to the scan direction ( i.e. declination overlap ) is only 12.4% of the scanline width ( these are two six - column strips which are later interleaved to make a filled stripe of imaging data ) , while the overlaps between runs 77 - 745 , 77 - 756 and 745 - 756 are 67.7% , 63.7% and 95.9% of the scanline width , respectively ( scanline width = 6 @xmath30 0.2253 deg = 1.3517 deg ) .",
    "rr lyrae stars have the colors of a and f stars ( preston 1959 ; for sdss colors see @xcite , @xcite ; note also figure 2 below ) and thus could be selected by appropriately constraining all four sdss colors , and then searching for variability .",
    "however , this would produce complicated selection effects because not all five bands have the same sensitivity . in order to avoid such effects",
    "we follow a two - step procedure ; the first step uses only data from the most sensitive @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , and only in the second step do we introduce color cuts based on data in all five bands . throughout this work we use the `` point",
    "spread function '' ( psf ) magnitudes ( measured by fitting a psf model of a double gaussian ) as computed by the photometric pipeline ( `` photo '' , version v5_1 , for details see @xcite ) .",
    "since rr lyrae stars are bluer in @xmath31 than most other stars , we started our search by selecting the 90569 unresolved and unsaturated sources with @xmath32 from @xmath2 930,000 stars in the overlap of runs 745 and 756 , and then required that candidate variable sources satisfied the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the difference between the magnitudes in the two runs in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands is at least 0.15@xmath18 .",
    "the difference between the magnitudes in the two runs in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands is at least 5@xmath33 . here",
    "the errors are taken as estimated by the photometric pipeline and do not include systematic calibration errors . however , because of the above requirement ( variability of at least 0.15@xmath18 ) , this condition becomes relevant only at the faint end where the errors are dominated by photon statistics ( see figure 1 below ) .",
    "candidates are brighter in @xmath34 when they are bluer in @xmath31 ( since rr lyrae stars are pulsating variable stars ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that the difference between the magnitudes in @xmath8 band is larger than the difference between the magnitudes in @xmath9 band .",
    "this condition is implemented without accounting for photometric errors .",
    "these selection criteria yield 186 candidates . in figure 1a ,",
    "the large dots show the observed change in the @xmath34 magnitude for the selected candidates plotted as a function of the mean @xmath34 magnitude .",
    "the small dots mark the remaining 90569 sources with @xmath32 .",
    "the two dashed lines show the boundary of the observational cutoff ( the combination of items 1 and 2 above ) .",
    "the mean errors ( for the magnitude difference ) are about 0.03@xmath18 up to 20@xmath18 , increasing to about 0.07@xmath18 at 21@xmath18 , and to 0.2@xmath18 at 22@xmath18 ; the observed error distribution is in good agreement with the errors quoted by the photometric pipeline ) .",
    "there are 21 stars ( @xmath35 ) rejected by the third condition @xmath36 , where indices 1 and 2 mark data from each epoch .",
    "this condition is shown by the diagonal dashed lines in figure 1b , where for clarity only stars with mean @xmath37 are plotted ( using the same symbols as in figure 1a ) .",
    "note that figures 1a and 1b show two projections of the three - dimensional selection volume spanned by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the mean @xmath34 magnitude .",
    "the rejected candidates are probably w uma stars , but may also be rr lyrae stars scattered across the selection boundary by photometric errors .",
    "the former probably dominate in the rejected subsample because more than @xmath40 are brighter than @xmath41 , and thus have very small photometric errors .",
    "the diagonal solid line in figure 1b shows a best - fit relation @xmath42 . similar analysis based on data from other bands yields @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where the uncertainty of best - fit coefficients is @xmath46 .",
    "a striking feature in figure 1a is the lack of faint objects with large variability amplitudes in the regions outlined by the two ellipses .",
    "the magnitude distribution of the rr lyrae candidates turns off rather sharply at r@xmath47 20 , even though nonvariable objects are detected 2.5 magnitudes fainter , and the errors are sufficiently small that variable sources with similar amplitudes could be detected to at least r@xmath47 21 ( see below ) .",
    "this indicates that we are detecting the faint end of the rr lyrae magnitude distribution , and hence the limit of their distance distribution .",
    "the absence of faint variable sources appears not to be due to our selection criteria , since sources in those two regions are already practically absent in the starting sample ( small dots in figure 1a ) . to repeat ,",
    "the starting sample was selected from the full data set by simply extracting unresolved sources in the appropriate @xmath31 color range .",
    "additional support for the reality of this cutoff comes from the analysis of the overlap between runs 77 and 745 .",
    "these runs were obtained 9 months apart , which is a sufficiently long baseline to detect quasar ( qso ) variability .",
    "although low - redshift qsos ( @xmath48 2 ) have @xmath31 colors similar to rr lyrae stars , they are easily distinguished by their bluer @xmath49 colors ( @xcite ) . since variable qsos should not have a faint magnitude cutoff , they can be used to test whether the data allow the detection of variable sources fainter than r@xmath47 20 .",
    "we searched for variable objects in the overlap of runs 77 and 745 ( @xmath2 35 deg@xmath0 ) using the same criteria outlined above .",
    "this new search is summarized in the right column panels in figure 2 , and compared to the results from the first search shown in the panels on the left .",
    "the top two panels are analogous to figure 1a ( indeed , the top left panel is the same ) .",
    "vertical lines at @xmath50 are added to guide the eye , and mark the apparent faint end of the rr lyrae magnitude distribution detected in runs 745 - 756 .",
    "qsos are selected by requiring @xmath51 and are marked by crosses .",
    "the color difference between qsos and rr lyrae stars can be easily seen in the @xmath31 vs. @xmath52 color - color diagrams shown in the two middle panels . in these diagrams",
    "variable sources are marked by lines which connect photometric measurements at the two epochs , and dots represent a subsample of 5000 nonvariable unresolved objects which outline the stellar locus and the position of low - z qsos ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "note that there are no variable sources with @xmath51 in the left panel since qsos do not vary much on a two day timescale .",
    "the lower two panels display @xmath34 vs. @xmath31 color - magnitude diagrams and show that we detect no rr lyrae stars fainter than @xmath53 even though variable qsos , which are selected by identical criteria , and without using the @xmath7 band data , are detected to @xmath54 .",
    "the described search procedure deliberately used only @xmath8 and @xmath9 band data in the first step in order to simplify selection effects , and thus to show that the faint magnitude limit of selected candidate rr lyrae stars  is real . for subsequent analysis",
    ", however , we further constrain the sample to sources with colors appropriate for rr lyrae stars ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "these limits are shown as boxes in the color - color diagrams displayed in figure 3 and result in the final sample of 148 stars .",
    "thus , 80% of the sources in the initial sample of 186 stars pass these tight additional criteria , showing that candidate rr lyrae stars  can be quite efficiently selected with only two - epoch two - band ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) data with a sufficiently short baseline to avoid contamination by variable qsos .",
    "about two - thirds of the 38 rejected sources narrowly fail one or two of the imposed color limits , and the remaining third usually fails by more than 0.5 magnitudes in a single color , most often in @xmath49 and @xmath59 . while the former may be rr lyrae stars , the latter are more likely to belong to various types of variable binary stars .",
    "the inclusion of the rejected sources in the subsequent analysis does not significantly change the resulting volume density of the selected candidates . however",
    ", it affects the estimated statistical significance of the observed cut - off in the candidates magnitude distribution at @xmath60 (  4.1 ) .",
    "the colors and variability properties of 148 stars in our final sample are consistent with their being rr lyrae stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , our observations were obtained @xmath2 2 days apart and thus are sensitive to the variability time scales characteristic for these stars ( 0.3 - 0.8 days , @xcite ) , while insensitive to objects varying on longer timescales ( qsos , long - period variables , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , the brightness variations are consistent with rr lyrae amplitudes ( 0.7 - 1.5 mag peak - to - peak , @xcite ) , and the candidates are bluer at the brighter epoch .",
    "while contamination by variable stars of similar properties ( e.g. dwarf cepheids or sx phe stars ) can not be excluded without detailed light curves and/or spectroscopic data , the expected level of contamination is probably not larger than 10% ( @xcite , @xcite , see also  4.3 ) .",
    "we will assume in the rest of this work that all sources in the final sample are rr lyrae stars .",
    "the selected candidate rr lyrae stars  are not smoothly distributed in magnitude , as can be seen in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "this clumpiness is also seen in their angular distribution .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of candidate rr lyrae stars , marked as open circles , in the mean @xmath34 vs. ra diagram .",
    "there is an obvious concentration of @xmath2 70 sources with @xmath61 and 205@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 230@xmath27 .",
    "this feature is present in all six data columns ( separated in declination ) , and the column - to - column scatter of counts in these ra and @xmath34 ranges is consistent with poisson statistics .    to test this feature further",
    ", we analyze additional two - epoch data from several different run combinations .",
    "as before , the detection of variable qsos in the overlap of runs 77 and 745 allows a powerful test because variable qsos should not display any spatial structure on such a large angular scale ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the distribution of variable objects detected in these two runs in the mean @xmath34 vs. ra diagram is shown in figure 5 ( note the different ra limits here from those in figure 4 ) .",
    "sources with @xmath64 , candidate rr lyrae stars , are marked by open circles and the sources with @xmath51 , presumably variable qsos , are marked by solid squares . while qsos are homogeneously distributed as expected , the distribution of candidate rr lyrae stars  is markedly different even though both samples were selected by identical criteria . at the same time",
    "the distribution of candidate rr lyrae stars , most notably the concentration of sources with @xmath61 at 215@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 230@xmath27 , is in agreement with the results obtained from the overlap of runs 745 and 756 , and shown in figure 4 .",
    "an overdensity of candidate rr lyrae stars  in the same magnitude - ra region is also detected in overlaps from runs 77 - 756 and 752 - 756 .",
    "a stellar overdensity analogous to that of candidate rr lyrae stars  in the region 205@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 230@xmath27 can also be seen in the distribution of nonvariable sources with similar colors .",
    "figure 6 displays the mean @xmath34 vs. ra diagram for 587 stars from the overlap of runs 745 and 756 satisfying @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the concentration of sources with @xmath61 and 205@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 230@xmath27 , the same magnitude ",
    "ra range as for the overdensity of candidate rr lyrae stars  displayed in figure 4 , is easily discernible and provides additional evidence for the clump .",
    "we used somewhat tighter color criteria than in the search for candidate rr lyrae stars , in order to decrease contamination by f stars from the blue tip of the stellar locus ( c.f .",
    "figure 2 ) .",
    "however , this contamination can not be entirely removed by using only color cuts , and sources with @xmath67 displayed in figure 6 are probably main sequence or blue straggler stars ( i.e. with smaller luminosities than rr lyrae stars , and thus intrinsically fainter ) .",
    "yanny et al .",
    "( 2000a ) also detect this clump and another smaller clump in the southern galactic hemisphere in sdss commissioning data by analyzing the distribution of stars with similar colors ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "a group of sources at ra @xmath2 230@xmath27 and @xmath70 can be seen in both figures 5 and 6 .",
    "these sources belong to the globular cluster palomar 5 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and represent its blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "figure 7 displays an @xmath34 vs. @xmath71 color - magnitude diagram for @xmath72 stars observed in run 756 inside a circle with 5 arcmin radius and centered on the position of the palomar 5 core ( j2000 ra = 15@xmath23 16@xmath18 5.3@xmath73 , dec = @xmath74 6 41 \" ) .",
    "five stars selected here as candidate rr lyrae stars  ( from the overlaps 745 - 756 , 77 - 745 and 77 - 756 ) are marked by lines which connect measurements at different epochs , and all fall in the appropriate blue horizontal branch region for palomar 5 ( @xmath75 17.5 , @xcite ) .",
    "this further reinforces the assumption that our selection criteria reliably select rr lyrae stars .",
    "the observed magnitudes of candidate rr lyrae stars  can be used to infer their distances and consequently their galactic distribution .",
    "we calculate distances to stars in the final sample by assuming constant luminosity of m@xmath76 = 0.7@xmath18 ( @xcite ) and transformation m@xmath76 = m@xmath77 ( @xcite ) which typically results in m@xmath76m@xmath78 @xmath2 0.05@xmath18 . for the apparent brightness estimate we use the mean @xmath34 magnitude",
    "corrected for the interstellar extinction , and for a 0.1@xmath18 bias due to asymmetric rr lyrae light curves ( see appendix a ) .",
    "typical values of the interstellar extinction , as determined from the maps given by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , are @xmath79 ( @xmath80 = 1.38 @xmath81 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the galactic distribution of candidate rr lyrae stars , displayed as small circles ( the large circle marks the sun s position at x=@xmath82 kpc , y=0 , z=0 ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the volume within which our data can detect rr lyrae stars : a very thin wedge with an opening angle of 80 deg and distances ranging from 5 kpc ( saturation limit , @xmath83 ) to 90 kpc ( faint limit , @xmath84 ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the intersection of this wedge with a galactocentric sphere of radius 30 kpc ( @xmath85 ) .    the clump of candidate rr lyrae stars  centered on ( x=20 kpc , y=10 kpc , z=40kpc ) , corresponds to the concentration of sources with @xmath61 and 205@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 230@xmath27 visible in figure 4 .",
    "the clump center is in a similar direction ( l=340@xmath27 , b=60@xmath27 ) as the center of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy at ( l=5.6@xmath27 , b=@xmath86 ) .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal is the closest known galactic satellite , with a galactocentric distance of 16@xmath202 kpc ( @xcite ) . in the coordinate system displayed in figure 8",
    "it is situated at x=15 kpc , y=@xmath87 kpc , z=@xmath88 kpc and marked by a triangle in the middle panel .",
    "the distance between its center and the clump is @xmath2 50 kpc .",
    "this is significantly larger than the extent of either structure ( @xmath2 10 kpc ) and probably implies that they are not physically associated .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the galactic orbit of the sgr dwarf spheroidal , as calculated by both ibata _ et al . _ and johnston _ et al . _",
    "( 1999a ) crosses the clump of candidate rr lyrae stars .",
    "we display this orbit , taken from johnston _",
    "( 1999a ) , by a solid line in figure 8 ( the direction of sgr dwarf s motion is towards the clump ) .",
    "such close proximity between the calculated orbit and the clump of candidate rr lyrae stars  may perhaps be evidence for presumed debris caused by tidal disruption of the sgr dwarf spheroidal ( @xcite , @xcite , ibata _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) in the galactic potential .",
    "additional observations of the surrounding area , and the radial velocity measurements for the clump stars , are required to further explore this hypothesis .    from the galactic distribution of candidate rr lyrae stars  presented in figure 8 ,",
    "we calculate their volume density as a function of galactocentric radius , and display it as data points with 1 @xmath33 error bars in figure 9 .",
    "the uncertainties are determined from poisson statistics in the vertical direction and from the bin width in the horizontal direction . since two - epoch data can not detect all rr lyrae stars , the overall normalization of the volume density includes unknown selection efficiency .",
    "we estimate that the selection efficiency is 56% , from a monte carlo study based on a set of model light curves with realistic amplitude and period distributions ( for details see appendix a ) .",
    "this estimate agrees well with two independent determinations described in  4.3 below .",
    "wetterer & mcgraw ( 1996 ) used a large compilation of available rr lyrae searches to find that their distribution follows an @xmath6 power law , where @xmath89 is the galactocentric radius .",
    "this is plotted as the thin solid line in figure 9 ; the thin dot - dashed lines represent their 1 @xmath33 normalization uncertainty ( @xmath2 factor of 2 ) .",
    "we find two noteworthy deviations from this power law .",
    "first , our analysis indicates that the rr lyrae volume density may follow a shallower power law with a best - fit index of 2.7 @xmath20 0.2 .",
    "second , the absence of rr lyrae stars with @xmath90 20 implies a rather sharp halo edge at @xmath91=50 - 60 kpc .",
    "figure 9 shows two power - law fits : the thick dot - dashed line is the @xmath92 power law determined for data with @xmath93 60 kpc , and the thick dashed line is the steep @xmath94 power law determined for data with @xmath89 @xmath95 50 kpc .",
    "the latter power - law is shown only for illustration and should not be taken literally ( note that there are only two data points at @xmath89 @xmath95 50 kpc ) .",
    "note that this sample is neither large enough , nor sufficiently extended over the sky , to constrain the halo flattening ( e.g. hartwick 1999 ) .",
    "these results imply that there are 2 - 3 times more rr lyrae stars at @xmath96 than predicted by the wetterer & mcgraw power law . however , it is obvious that a shallower power - law is obtained mainly because of the large number of candidates in the `` 45 kpc '' clump .",
    "when they are excluded by constraining the sample to radii less than 35 kpc , the best fit power - law fit becomes @xmath97 , in agreement with the wetterer & mcgraw result , including the normalization at the bright end .",
    "the same result is obtained when the sample is constrained to 160@xmath27 @xmath62 ra @xmath62 200@xmath27 ( see figure 4 ) , and in this case the fit is satisfactory all the way to r @xmath2 50 kpc .",
    "this may indicate that the halo contains clumpy overdensities inhomogeneously distributed within an underlying smooth @xmath6 density distribution .",
    "the statistical significance of the observed lack of candidate rr lyrae stars with @xmath67 can be determined from the expected number of candidates with such magnitudes . however , it is difficult to estimate this number with certainty because of the observed clumpy spatial distribution of selected candidates , and because of only weakly constrained selection effects at the faint end .",
    "we estimate the expected number of candidates with @xmath67 by extrapolating the @xmath6 power - law density to infinity ( this power - law implies a flat magnitude distribution for sources with uniform luminosity ) .",
    "a monte carlo study of the selection effects described in the appendix finds that the selection efficiency starts to fall off slowly for @xmath98 , reduces to about 50% at @xmath60 , and drops to 0 for @xmath99 .",
    "confirmation of this fall - off comes from analyzing the variable qso sample .",
    "assuming that the fraction of variable qsos does not depend on their magnitude ( we find this fraction to be @xmath100 15% ) , the efficiency determined from simulations is in agreement with that implied by the observed numbers of variable qsos ( which , however , may have very different light curves ) .",
    "we adopt 25% as the mean efficiency in the @xmath101 magnitude range . in order to avoid the effects of the clumpy spatial distribution , we determine the expected density of candidates by considering only those satisfying @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( c.f . figure 4 ) .",
    "we estimate a density of 18 mag@xmath104 , normalized to the entire ra range . with the adopted efficiency ,",
    "we find that the expected number of candidate rr lyrae stars with @xmath67 is 7 , while we have selected none .",
    "the poisson probability for this outcome is @xmath105 .",
    "a more conservative approach may be taken by considering all 186 candidates from the first selection step ( i.e. before the color cuts described in  2 were imposed to yield the final sample of 148 sources ) . due to a larger number of candidates ,",
    "the expected number of sources with @xmath67 is increased to 9 . as can be seen in figures 1a and 2 ,",
    "there are 4 sources which barely missed the cuts and could perhaps be rr lyrae stars .",
    "the poisson probability that 4 or fewer sources are observed , given the expectation value of 9 , is @xmath106 . as evident , this approach significantly reduces the implied statistical significance of the observed cut - off at @xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that the significance of the observed cut - off is at the level of 2 - 3 @xmath33 ( in terms of equivalent gaussian probability ) .",
    "the best way to improve this estimate is to obtain follow - up observations of the rejected sources to establish whether they are rr lyrae stars , and of course to analyze data for a significantly larger sky area .",
    "the final sample of candidate rr lyrae stars  presented here is based on commissioning data taken at only two epochs . in order to estimate the level of spurious variability detections",
    "we have cross - referenced our list with the list of variable objects found from the fastt ( flagstaff astrometric scanning transit telescope ) data ( @xcite ) and with the loneos ( lowell observatory near earth object search ) database .",
    "the loneos data fully cover the overlap of runs 745 and 756 , while the overlap with the fastt fields is only partial ( @xmath2 40 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "both data sets can detect variable stars brighter than @xmath107 .",
    "henden & stone ( 1998 ) require that a candidate variable star show night - to - night scatter ( typically 8 - 12 epochs ) larger than 3 times the expected error in the magnitude .",
    "based on a random sampling of a set of model light curves with realistic amplitude and period distributions ( see appendix a ) , we determine that the mean root - mean - square scatter for rr lyrae stars is @xmath2 0.3@xmath18 .",
    "the photometric accuracy of fastt data ( see figure 1a in @xcite ) implies that the detection efficiency for rr lyrae stars in fastt data should drop sharply for @xmath108 .",
    "the list of selected candidate rr lyrae stars  includes 16 sources which are sufficiently bright and in the fastt fields .",
    "we find that 14 of them are indeed in the henden & stone list as published , and one was detected later from additional observations ( a. henden , priv .",
    "this implies a reliability of our selection procedure of 94% . the remaining source , with a mean",
    "@xmath109 ( sdssp j110838.26@xmath110000514.3 , see table 2 below ) , is definitely variable in sdss data , with amplitudes exceeding 0.15@xmath18 in all 5 bands ( 0.34@xmath18 in @xmath111 ) .",
    "to estimate the efficiency of our two - epoch selection procedure , we matched all sources with appropriate colors ( c.f .",
    " 2 ) detected in the sdss data ( 8786 sources ) to the henden & stone list and found 33 matches ( note that here no magnitude limit is imposed ) . as we recovered 17 of them as candidate rr lyrae stars",
    ", this implies an efficiency of ( 52@xmath2015)% , assuming that all henden & stone variable sources with appropriate sdss colors are rr lyrae stars .",
    "the sensitivity of the loneos data for variability detection drops sharply for @xmath108 , and 33 stars in our sample are brighter than this limit . for two of these stars",
    "no loneos data are available ( both stars are too close to much brighter objects ) . of the remaining 31 stars",
    "the loneos data clearly indicate variability for 29 ( 94% ) and are inconclusive for the other two .",
    "unfortunately , because of their coarse sampling in time , neither the loneos data nor the fastt data can be used to produce light curves which could definitively identify the variable objects as rr lyrae stars .      while the sdss multi - color photometry indicates that all candidates discussed here have colors appropriate for rr lyrae stars , there exist other types of variable star with similar colors .",
    "for example , w uma stars can have f type spectra but they should be efficiently screened out by the selection requirement that candidates must be brighter in @xmath34 when they are bluer in @xmath31 .",
    "the most significant contaminants are probably @xmath112 scu stars , another pulsating variable type with approximately the same color range as the rr lyrae stars , periods of 1 - 3 hours , and magnitudes about 0.5@xmath18 fainter than rr lyrae stars ( hoffmeister _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) . for example",
    ", the tycho photometric survey finds that for @xmath113 , the numbers of rr lyrae stars and @xmath112 scu stars are comparable .",
    "however , the population i @xmath112 scu stars should start to run out at a distance of @xmath2 2 kpc from the galactic plane , or equivalently at @xmath114 for @xmath115 . on the other hand ,",
    "the population ii @xmath112 scu stars , also known as sx phe stars , contribute only 10% to the @xmath112 scu population ( g. burks , priv .",
    "thus , the likely contamination of our sample should not be more than 10% , which would not qualitatively change our results .",
    "we note that this fraction may be somewhat larger if the number of sx phe stars decreases more slowly with galactocentric radius than does the number of rr lyrae stars . in the following section we discuss multi - epoch photometric observations for seven sdss - selected candidate rr lyrae stars , and",
    "show that all observed light curves have shapes and periods typical for rr lyrae stars .",
    "this result is consistent with the above estimate for the contamination fraction of @xmath116 10% .",
    "another independent piece of evidence that our sample is dominated by the low - gravity rr lyrae stars is that the @xmath49 colors for the selected candidates are redder than those of the parent population .",
    "it has been long known that balmer jumps are bigger for horizontal branch stars than for main sequence stars ( e.g. oke , giver & searle 1962 , pier 1983 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath49 colors for horizontal branch stars are redder than for main sequence stars , given the same @xmath71 color ( lenz et al .",
    "1998 ) . figure 10 shows the @xmath49 color distribution for stars selected by @xmath117 ( c.f . figure 2 , this narrow range of @xmath71 color selects stars with similar effective temperature , @xmath100 7000 - 8000 k , lenz _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) from the 90569 stars shown in figure 1a ( dashed line ) and for stars selected by the same criterion from the resulting sample of candidate rr lyrae stars ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xmath49 color of candidate rr lyrae stars is 0.2 mag redder , on average , than that of nonvariable stars within the same narrow range of @xmath71 color . for main sequence stars",
    "the expected @xmath49 range is 0.851.0 ( indicated as a horizontal line marked as log(g)=4.5 in the figure ) and for horizontal branch stars the expected @xmath49 range is 1.11.3 ( horizontal line marked as log(g)=2.5 ) , as found by lenz _",
    "the intrinsic spread of the @xmath49 color for a given gravity is due to varying metallicity ; the plotted values correspond to the range @xmath118 < 0 $ ] .",
    "the observed distribution of the @xmath49 colors of nonvariable stars is consistent with them being a mixture of low - gravity and high - gravity stars ( for a detailed study of a stars detected in sdss commissioning data see yanny _ et al . _",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the number of candidates found here agrees within 1@xmath33 with the normalization given by wetterer & mcgraw ( 1996 ) .",
    "while this supports the low level of contamination by other types of variable star , the large uncertainty of their normalization and our efficiency prevents an accurate determination of such contamination in our sample . as already discussed in  3 , our normalization assumes an efficiency for detecting rr lyrae stars from two - epoch data of 56% determined by the procedure described in appendix a. this estimate agrees well with the efficiency determined from the comparison with the fastt data ( 52@xmath2015 % ) .",
    "another way to estimate efficiency is to compare the subsamples detected in the 20.9 deg@xmath0 overlap of runs 77 , 745 and 756 .",
    "there are 41 candidates selected from runs 745 and 756 , and 37 candidates from runs 77 and 745 .",
    "these two subsamples have 16 sources in common , implying an efficiency of ( 41@xmath2012)% , in good agreement with the above estimates .",
    "the accepted identifying characteristics of an rr lyrae star are its light curve and period . here",
    "we present preliminary results of follow - up observations for several candidate rr lyrae stars selected from sdss commissioning data .",
    "one of the faintest candidates in the sample , sdssp j113049.26@xmath110005918.2 ( @xmath119 ) , was monitored for five nights during march 2000 with the sdss 20-inch photometric telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico .",
    "25 individual measurements in @xmath8 band were taken over the five nights ; the resulting light curve is shown in figure 11a .",
    "the preliminary estimate for the period is 0.46379 d , and the the first maximum is at hjd 2451606.2323 .",
    "both the light curve shape and the period confirm that this candidate is a bona fide rr lyrae star .",
    "the observed apparent magnitude of this star places it at @xmath100 55 kpc from the galactic center , and at @xmath100 44 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "another sample of six candidate rr lyrae stars was selected from sdss commissioning data obtained in the southern galactic hemisphere 59 days apart during the fall of 1998 .",
    "while these data are not used in this work , the candidates were selected by the identical selection procedures .",
    "the candidates were observed in the johnson v band by the 0.76-m reflector of the university of washington s manastash ridge observatory during the fall of 1999 .",
    "these observations were supplemented with data obtained from the loneos database and the resulting light curves are shown in figure 11b , together with the candidates names and periods .",
    "all six candidates have light curves with shapes and periods characteristic of rr lyrae stars .",
    "their average galactocentric distance is 30 kpc .",
    "these prefatory follow - up observations show that the majority of stars in our sample are probably rr lyrae stars , and support the estimate that the contamination by other types of variable star is @xmath116 10% .",
    "these preliminary results obtained with a small sample of sdss data indicate its potential for various galactic structure studies .",
    "for example , the sdss - fastt and sdss - loneos comparisons , and the light curves presented in figure 11 , demonstrate that even two - epoch sdss photometric data are sufficient for efficient detection of variable stars .",
    "the sample of candidate rr lyrae stars  presented here shows that such a deep and wide area survey may significantly contribute to studies of the outer galactic halo .",
    "nevertheless , it is probable that this sample does not contain only rr lyrae stars , and that some of the assumptions in our analysis may not be valid .",
    "the most straightforward approach to determine the contamination level by variable stars other than rr lyrae stars is to obtain light curves for all candidates ( so far only a few hundred , but over the next few years sdss will produce several thousand candidate rr lyrae stars ) . to facilitate such observations , table 2 lists coordinates and two - epoch sdss photometry in @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands for 148 candidates discussed in this work .",
    "for the confirmed rr lyrae stars the measurements of their radial velocity offer the exciting possibility of measuring the distribution of dark matter throughout the halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for many insightful comments .",
    "we also thank geoff burks , bohdan paczynski , and christophe alard for helpful discussions regarding the contamination of rr lyrae sample by other variable stars .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "is a joint project of the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , the max - planck - institute for astronomy , princeton university , the united states naval observatory , and the university of washington .",
    "apache point observatory , site of the sdss , is operated by the astrophysical research consortium .",

    "the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/.    to determine the sensitivity of two - epoch selection of rr lyrae stars presented in this work , we randomly sample a set of model light curves with realistic amplitude and period distributions .",
    "we use for this purpose a set of 180 rr lyrae star light curves extensively measured by the rotse projectrotse ] as described by akerlof _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "spline fits to these phased light curves provide our templates .",
    "for each template object we sample the light curve at two points separated by the nominal 1.99462 days spacing for 1000 random phases . because this spacing is at least 3 times longer than typical rr lyrae star periods ( @xmath116 0.7 days )",
    ", the details of the adopted period distribution have only a minor impact on the model results . for the same reason , stars with periods shorter than rr lyrae periods ( e.g. sx phe stars ) are selected with roughly the same efficiency . for each sampling",
    "we obtain a real magnitude difference , apply sdss photometric errors to the two ` measurements ' , and determine whether this object would pass our variability selection criteria .",
    "this allows us to realistically assess our efficiency as a function of magnitude .",
    "in addition it allows us to characterize the effect of two epoch observations on our observed mean magnitudes , and hence on distance estimates .",
    "we find that at bright magnitudes , the detection efficiency is constant at the level of 56% , which is imposed by the combination of the two - epoch selection and rr lyrae light curve shapes .",
    "the efficiency falls off slowly beginning at @xmath120 due to increased photometric errors , and is reduced to half its peak value at @xmath53 .",
    "we also find that the mean magnitudes calculated from two - epoch data are biased towards the bright side for about 0.1@xmath18 because the rr lyrae light curves are not symmetric around the mean brightness .",
    "the mean root - mean - square deviation of rr lyrae light curves used in this analysis is 0.21@xmath18 , and is practically independent of the number of epochs as long as it exceeds @xmath121 .",
    "we note that the light curves used in this analysis were obtained with an open ccd and thus are representative of the red bands . because of this effect , the rr lyrae amplitudes in bluer bands ( e.g. @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) may be somewhat larger and we adopt a conservative upper limit of 0.3@xmath18 used in the comparison with the fastt data (  4.1 ) .",
