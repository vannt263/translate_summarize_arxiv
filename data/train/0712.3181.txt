    "during the last 30 years .",
    "physics of surfaces and objects of nanometric size have attracted an immense interest .",
    "this is due to important applications in industry.@xcite an example is the so - called giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) used in data storage devices , magnetic sensors , ...",
    "@xcite in parallel to these experimental developments , much theoretical effort@xcite has also been devoted to the search of physical mechanisms lying behind new properties found in nanoscale objects such as ultrathin films , ultrafine particles , quantum dots , spintronic devices etc .",
    "this effort aimed not only at providing explanations for experimental observations but also at predicting new effects for future experiments .",
    "the physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is very exciting .",
    "some of those 2d systems can be exactly solved : one famous example is the ising model on the square lattice which has been solved by onsager.@xcite this model shows a phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction . another interesting result is the absence of long - range ordering at finite temperatures for the continuous spin models ( xy and heisenberg models ) in 2d.@xcite in general , three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems for any spin models can not be unfortunately solved .",
    "however , several methods in the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena can be used to calculate the critical behaviors of these systems.@xcite    this paper deals with systems between 2d and 3d .",
    "many theoretical studies have been devoted to thermodynamic properties of thin films , magnetic multilayers , ... @xcite in spite of this , several points are still not yet understood .",
    "it is known a long time ago that the presence of a surface in magnetic materials can give rise to surface spin - waves which are localized in the vicinity of the surface.@xcite these localized modes may be acoustic with a low - lying energy or optical with a high energy , in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "low - lying energy modes contribute to reduce in general surface magnetization at finite temperatures .",
    "one of the consequences is the surface disordering which may occur at a temperature lower than that for interior magnetization.@xcite the existence of low - lying surface modes depends on the lattice structure , the surface orientation , the surface parameters , surface conditions ( impurities , roughness , ... ) etc .",
    "there are two interesting cases : in the first case a surface transition occurs at a temperature distinct from that of the interior spins and in the second case the surface transition coincides with the interior one , i. e. existence of a single transition .",
    "theory of critical phenomena at surfaces@xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite of critical behavior of the surface - layer magnetization at the extraordinary transition in the three - dimensional ising model have been carried out .",
    "these works suggested several scenarios in which the nature of the surface transition and the transition in thin films depends on many factors in particular on the symmetry of the hamiltonian and on surface parameters .",
    "we confine ourselves here in the case of a simple cubic film with ising model . for our purpose , we suppose all interactions are the same everywhere even at the surface . this case is the simplest case where there is no surface - localized spin - wave modes and there is only a single phase transition at a temperature for the whole system ( no separate surface phase",
    "transition).@xcite other complicated cases will be left for future investigations . however , some preliminary discussions on this point for complicated surfaces have been reported in some of our previous papers.@xcite in the case of a simple cubic film with ising model , capehart and fisher have studied the critical behavior of the susceptibility using a finite - size scaling analysis.@xcite they showed that there is a crossover from 2d to 3d behavior as the film thickness increases .",
    "the so - called `` effective '' exponent @xmath5 has been shown to vary according to a scaling function depending both on the film thickness and the distance to the transition temperature . as will be seen below the scaling suggested by capehart and fisher",
    "is in agreement with what we find here using extensive mc simulation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the thickness on the critical exponents of the film . to carry out these purposes",
    ", we shall use mc simulations with highly accurate multiple histogram technique.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a description of the model and method .",
    "results are shown and discussed in section iii .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "let us consider the ising spin model on a film made from a ferromagnetic simple cubic lattice .",
    "the size of the film is @xmath6 .",
    "we apply the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in the @xmath7 planes to simulate an infinite @xmath7 dimension .",
    "the @xmath8 direction is limited by the film thickness @xmath9 . if @xmath10 then one has a 2d square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ising spin of magnitude 1 occupying the lattice site @xmath13 , @xmath14 indicates the sum over the nn spin pairs @xmath12 and @xmath15 .    in the following ,",
    "the interaction between two nn surface spins is denoted by @xmath16 , while all other interactions are supposed to be ferromagnetic and all equal to @xmath17 for simplicity .",
    "let us note in passing that in the semi - infinite crystal the surface phase transition occurs at the bulk transition temperature when @xmath18 .",
    "this point is called `` extraordinary phase transition '' which is characterized by some particular critical exponents.@xcite in the case of thin films , i. e. @xmath9 is finite , it has been theoretically shown that when @xmath19 the bulk behavior is observed when the thickness becomes larger than a few dozens of atomic layers:@xcite surface effects are insignificant on thermodynamic properties such as the value of the critical temperature , the mean value of magnetization at a given @xmath20 , ... when @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath4 , surface magnetization is destroyed at a temperature lower than that for bulk spins.@xcite the criticality of a film with uniform interaction , i.e. @xmath21 , has been studied by capehart and fisher as a function of the film thickness using a scaling analysis@xcite and by mc simulations.@xcite the results by capehart and fisher indicated that as long as the film thickness is finite the phase transition is strictly that of the 2d ising universality class .",
    "however , they showed that at a temperature away from the transition temperature @xmath22 , the system can behave as a 3d one when the spin - spin correlation length @xmath23 is much smaller than the film thickness , i. e. @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath20 gets very close to @xmath22 , @xmath25 , the system undergoes a crossover to 2d criticality .",
    "we will return to this work for comparison with our results shown below .",
    "the multiple histogram technique is known to reproduce with very high accuracy the critical exponents of second order phase transitions.@xcite    the overall probability distribution@xcite at temperature @xmath20 obtained from @xmath26 independent simulations , each with @xmath27 configurations , is given by @xmath28}{\\sum_{j=1}^n n_j\\exp[e / k_bt_j - f_j ] } , \\label{eq : mhp}\\ ] ] where @xmath29=\\sum_{e}p(e , t_i ) .",
    "\\label{eq : mhfn}\\ ] ]    the thermal average of a physical quantity @xmath30 is then calculated by @xmath31 in which @xmath32    thermal averages of physical quantities are thus calculated as continuous functions of @xmath20 , now the results should be valid over a much wider range of temperature than for any single histogram .    in mc simulations",
    ", one calculates the averaged order parameter @xmath33 ( @xmath34 : magnetization of the system ) , averaged total energy @xmath35 , specific heat @xmath36 , susceptibility @xmath37 , first order cumulant of the energy @xmath38 , and @xmath39 order cumulant of the order parameter @xmath40 for @xmath41 and 2 .",
    "these quantities are defined as    @xmath42    let us discuss the case where all dimensions can go to infinity . for example , consider a system of size @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the space dimension . for a finite @xmath45 ,",
    "the pseudo `` transition '' temperatures can be identified by the maxima of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , .... these maxima do not in general take place at the same temperature . only at infinite @xmath45 that the pseudo `` transition '' temperatures of these respective quantities coincide at the real transition temperature @xmath46 .",
    "so when we work at the maxima of @xmath40 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we are in fact working at temperatures away from @xmath46 .",
    "let us define the reduced temperature which measures the `` distance '' from @xmath46 by    @xmath47    this distance tends to zero when all dimensions go to infinity . for large values of @xmath45 ,",
    "the following scaling relations are expected ( see details in ref . ):",
    "@xmath48    @xmath49    and @xmath50 at their respective transition temperatures @xmath51 , and    @xmath52+al^{-\\alpha/\\nu},\\ ] ]    @xmath53    and @xmath54 where @xmath30 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constants .",
    "we estimate @xmath0 independently from @xmath58 and @xmath59 . with this value",
    "we calculate @xmath5 from @xmath60 and @xmath61 from @xmath62 . note that we can estimate @xmath46 using the last expression .",
    "then , using @xmath46 , we can calculate @xmath1 from @xmath63 .",
    "the rushbrooke scaling law @xmath64 is then in principle verified .",
    "let us emphasize that the expressions eqs .",
    "( [ v1])-([tc ] ) are valid for large @xmath45 . to be sure that @xmath45 are large enough",
    ", one has to allow for corrections to scaling of the form , for example ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants and @xmath70 is a correction",
    "exponent.@xcite similar forms exist also for the other exponents . usually , these corrections are extremely small if @xmath45 is large enough as is the case with today s large - memory computers .",
    "so , in general they do not therefore alter the results using eqs .",
    "( [ v1])-([tc ] ) .      in the case of a thin film of size @xmath6 , capehart and fisher@xcite have showed that as long as the film thickness @xmath9 is not allowed to go to infinity , there is a 2d-3d crossover if one does not work at the real transition temperature @xmath71 .",
    "following capehart and fisher , let us define    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the 3d @xmath0 exponent and @xmath74 the 3d critical temperature .",
    "when @xmath75 is larger than a value @xmath76 , i. e. at a temperature away from @xmath77 , the system behaves as a 3d one . while when @xmath78 , it should behave as a 2d one .",
    "this crossover was argued from a comparison of the correlation length in the @xmath8 direction to the film thickness . as a consequence ,",
    "if we work exactly at @xmath77 we should observe the 2d critical exponents for finite @xmath9 .",
    "otherwise , we should observe the so - called `` effective critical exponents '' whose values are found between those of 2d and 3d cases .",
    "this point is fundamentally very important .",
    "there have been some attempts to verify it by mc simulations,@xcite but these results were not convincing due to their poor mc quality . in the following we show with high - precision mc technique that the prediction of capehart and fisher is really verified .",
    "the @xmath7 linear sizes @xmath79 have been used in our simulations . for @xmath80 , sizes up to 160 have been used to evaluate corrections to scaling .    in practice",
    ", we use first the standard mc simulations to localize for each size the transition temperatures @xmath81 for specific heat and @xmath82 for susceptibility .",
    "the equilibrating time is from 200000 to 400000 mc steps / spin and the averaging time is from 500000 to 1000000 mc steps / spin .",
    "next , we make histograms at @xmath83 different temperatures @xmath84 around the transition temperatures @xmath85 with 2 millions mc steps / spin , after discarding 1 millions mc steps / spin for equilibrating . finally , we make again histograms at @xmath83 different temperatures around the new transition temperatures @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 mc steps / spin for equilibrating and averaging time , respectively .",
    "such an iteration procedure gives extremely good results for systems studied so far .",
    "errors shown in the following have been estimated using statistical errors , which are very small thanks to our multiple histogram procedure , and fitting errors given by fitting software .",
    "we note that only @xmath0 is directly calculated from mc data .",
    "exponent @xmath5 obtained from @xmath60 and @xmath0 suffers little errors ( systematic errors and errors from @xmath0 ) .",
    "other exponents are obtained by mc data and several - step fitting .",
    "for example , to obtain @xmath61 we have to fit @xmath62 of eq .",
    "[ cv ] by choosing @xmath55 , @xmath56 and by using the value of @xmath0 .",
    "so , in practice , in most cases , one calculates @xmath61 or @xmath1 from mc data and uses the rushbrooke scaling law to calculate the remaining exponent .",
    "now , similar to the discussion given in subsection [ mht ] , if we work at a distance away from @xmath77 we should observe `` effective critical exponents '' .",
    "this is the case because in the finite size analysis using the multiple histogram technique , we measure the maxima of @xmath40 , @xmath88 and @xmath37 which occur at different temperatures for a finite @xmath45 . these temperatures , though close to , are not @xmath77 . to give a precision on this point",
    ", we show the values of these maxima and the corresponding temperatures for @xmath89 in table [ nz7 ] . for the value of @xmath90 , see table [ tab : criexp ] .    [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we consider here the effects of larger @xmath45 and of the correction to scaling . for the effect of larger @xmath45 , we will extend our size up to @xmath91 , for just the case @xmath80 .",
    "the results indicate that larger @xmath45 does not change the results shown above .",
    "figure [ fig : gnl160](a ) displays the maximum of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath45 up to 160 . using eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) , i. e. without correction to scaling , we obtain @xmath93 which is to be compared to @xmath94 using @xmath45 up to 80 .",
    "the change is therefore insignificant because it is at the third decimal i. e. at the error level .",
    "the same is observed for @xmath95 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnl160](b ) : @xmath96 using @xmath45 up to 160 instead of @xmath97 using @xmath45 up to 80 .",
    "now , let us allow for correction to scaling , i. e. we use eq.([chic ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ chis ] ) for fitting .",
    "we obtain the following values : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 if we use @xmath45 = 70 to 160 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : correct ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath95 in the case of no scaling correction is @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that this correction is insignificant .",
    "the large value of @xmath70 explains the smallness of the correction .      to close this section ,",
    "let us touch upon the question : does the absence of pbc in the @xmath8 direction cause the deviation of the critical exponents ?",
    "the answer is no : we have calculated @xmath0 and @xmath5 for @xmath103 in both cases , with and without pbc in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the results show no significant difference between the two cases as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuz5 ] and [ fig : gamz5 ] .",
    "we have found the same thing with @xmath104 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuz11 ] and [ fig : gamz11 ] .",
    "so , we conclude that the fixed thickness will result in the deviation of the critical exponents , not from the absence of the pbc .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since we may think , incorrectly , that the pbc should mimic the infinite dimension so that we should obtain the 3d behavior when applying the pbc .",
    "as will be seen below , the 3d behavior is recovered only when the finite size scaling is applied in the @xmath8 direction at the same time in the @xmath7 plane . to show this , we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : nul3d ] and [ fig : gaml3d ] the results for the 3d case .",
    "even with our modest sizes ( up to @xmath105 , since it is not our purpose to treat the 3d case here ) , we obtain @xmath106 and @xmath107 very close to their 3d best known values @xmath108 from ref . and @xmath109 and @xmath110 obtained by using @xmath111 given in ref .",
    "we have considered a simple system , namely the ising model on a simple cubic thin film , in order to clarify the point whether or not there is a continuous deviation of the 2d exponents with varying film thickness . from results obtained by the highly accurate multiple histogram technique shown above ,",
    "we conclude that the critical exponents in thin films show a continuous deviation from their 2d values as soon as the thickness departs from 1 .",
    "this deviation stems from a deep physical mechanism : capehart and fisher@xcite have argued that if one works exactly at the critical temperature @xmath71 then the critical exponents should be those of 2d universality class as long as the film thickness is finite . at @xmath71 ,",
    "the correlation in the @xmath8 direction @xmath112 remains finite while those in the @xmath7 planes become infinite .",
    "hence @xmath112 is irrelevant to the criticality .",
    "this yields therefore the 2d behavior .",
    "however , when the system is away from @xmath71 , as is the case in numerical simulations using finite sizes , the system may have a 3d behavior as long as @xmath113 .",
    "this should yield a deviation of 2d critical exponents .",
    "the results we obtained in this paper verify this picture .",
    "in addition , the prediction of capehart and fisher for the shift of the critical temperature with the film thickness is in a perfect agreement with our simulations .",
    "note furthermore that ( i ) the deviations of the exponents from their 2d values are very different in magnitude : while @xmath0 and @xmath61 vary very little over the studied range of thickness , @xmath5 and specially @xmath1 suffer stronger deviations , ( ii ) with a fixed thickness @xmath114 , the same `` effective '' exponents are observed , within errors , in simulations with and without periodic boundary condition in the @xmath8 direction , ( iii ) to obtain the 3d behavior , the finite size scaling should be applied simultaneously in the three directions , i. e. all dimensions should be allowed to go to infinity . if we do not apply the scaling in the @xmath8 direction , we will not obtain 3d behavior even with a very large , but fixed , thickness and even with periodic boundary condition in the @xmath8 direction , ( iv ) with regard to the critical behavior , thin films behave as systems with effective critical exponents whose values are those between 2d and 3d .",
    "to conclude , we hope that the numerical results shown in this paper will help experimentalists to interpret their data which are usually obtained at a finite distance from the critical point",
    ". it should be also desirable to study more cases to clarify the role of thickness on the behavior of very thin films , in particular the effect of the film thickness on the bulk first - order transition .",
