    "in nematic elastomers and gels , liquid crystal ordering and the nematic director are coupled to the mechanical degrees of freedom . both symmetric shear strains and antisymmetric deformations couple to the director .",
    "since the macroscopic shape of the polymer network naturally depends on the chain anisotropy direction , the coupling gives rise to some remarkable features of the elasticity : shape can change spontaneously by well over 50% on changing temperature through the clearing point , shears can induce director rotation , and some shear deformations cost no change in energy in the ideal case .",
    "we call this last effect `` soft elasticity '' .",
    "it is unique to nematic networks and other elastic solids where a non - elastic internal degree of freedom is coupled to the mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "the additional symmetries leading to softness were predicted phenomenologically by golubovic and lubensky @xcite and from statistical mechanics of large deformations by bladon _",
    "et al _ @xcite . depending on the thermo - mechanical history ,",
    "nematic elastomers have been shown to demonstrate either extreme softness or substantial deviations from soft response @xcite .",
    "systems with such residual resistance to deformation have been called semi - soft @xcite .",
    "they are qualitatively like soft elastomers in that the same particular modes of non - trivial deformation cost a very small elastic energy , compared to other non - specific deformations .",
    "conventional nematics couple strongly to electric fields ( @xmath0 ) , the director aligning parallel to the field in the case of positive dielectric anisotropy @xmath1 .",
    "when the director is anchored at boundaries and the sample is uniformly aligned perpendicular to the direction to be taken by the electric field , there is a transition ( fredericks ) at a finite critical voltage , @xmath2 , above which the director is deflected by the field .",
    "the electric fredericks effect and its analogues are the basis of most liquid crystalline displays . director rotation to lower the dielectric energy in the bulk becomes non - uniform if the boundary anchoring of the director is to be respected . in this case",
    "the frank elastic energy density @xmath3 opposes the field effect , where @xmath4 is a frank constant and @xmath5 is the nematic director .",
    "for a cell of thickness @xmath6 with strong anchoring on the boundaries the frank energy is of order @xmath7 per unit area of cell ( where @xmath8 , crudely ) .",
    "the corresponding electrical energy per unit area is , roughly , @xmath9 . these are comparable for a field of @xmath10 or an applied _ voltage _",
    "@xmath11 , where the fredericks transition occurs .",
    "the response of the nematic director to applied electric fields in nematic elastomers and gels raises questions about the role of the elastic properties of the polymer network in limiting the director response .",
    "likewise , the reorientation of the director by an external field can lead to elastic deformations .",
    "nematic elastomers have been seen to respond to modest electric fields @xcite by changing their shape when they are geometrically unconstrained . at first sight",
    "this is unexpected since the energy scale for shape change in a solid is of order @xmath12 , the shear modulus . balancing this with the electrical energy ,",
    "the characteristic fields required to change shape should be @xmath13 for a typical rubber modulus @xmath14 and a substantial dielectric anisotropy @xmath15 .",
    "this is a large field , whereas shape changes were observed for modest electric fields .",
    "however , because nematic elastomers can suffer certain shape changes with little or no energy cost , which can potentially be achieved most easily in a completely unrestricted sample , such observations add weight to the concept of soft mechanical response .",
    "more recent experiments of chang _",
    "et al _ @xcite show an electro - optical response in a nematic gel in the usual constrained fredericks geometry .",
    "they observe the director response by the method of optical conoscopy , and find an elevated threshold _ field _ rather than voltage for director reorientation .",
    "they analyze their data in the classical fredericks manner . however , to explain the threshold field , they invoke both a bulk anchoring mechanism and an intrinsic , material - defined length scale for gradients of the director , rather than the sample thickness , which sets the length scale for a simple nematic . given that finite fields were required , chang _",
    "et al _ were not observing pure soft elasticity of the gel .",
    "it is not clear that the nematic gel can react softly in the fredericks geometry , since the delicate combination of shears required to accommodate the director at no cost of elastic energy is frustrated by the cell electrodes , to which the nematic solid must conform .    at this point",
    "it is important to recall another physical system , prepared in a way similar to the swollen nematic gels of chang _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "polymer - stabilized liquid crystals ( pslc ) @xcite are formed from a mixture of common nematic and polymerizable monomers .",
    "on polymerization , complete phase separation occurs and , when the polymerization occurs in an aligned geometry , the resulting polymer fibrilles preserve the direction of anisotropy by creating a large amount of internal boundary .",
    "thus , the phase - separated polymer mesh provides both a bulk anchoring mechanism and an intrinsic small ( micrometer size ) length scale for director response .",
    "however , the response time for director reorientation for both field - on and off cases is fast ( which is one of the reasons for pslc use ) .",
    "the compounds used by chang _",
    "et al _ were highly miscible and had a slow response dynamics , characteristic of nematic gels .",
    "we assume , therefore , that their experiment dealt with an aligned homogeneous gel , composed of cross - linked single molecular strands of nematic side chain acrylate polymer , swollen by a solvent of similar mesogenic molecules , rather than a pslc system .    in this paper we reconsider the experimental observations of chang _",
    "et al_. we seek to explain the new electro - optical transition in terms of a homogeneous response of the director , rather than invoking a new small length scale .",
    "the elevated field threshold and the director response above threshold are accounted for by the coupling of the director to the elastic polymer network .",
    "this analysis is partially supported by some new experimental observations indicating that the samples respond to the electric field on a scale comparable to the sample thickness , rather than on a much smaller scale . to summarize this new analysis",
    ", we find that the free energy density for director rotation through angle @xmath16 in a nematic elastomer is schematically represented by @xmath17 the frank and the dielectric terms are as in classical nematics .",
    "the rubber - elastic @xmath18 terms are the resistance the gel network presents to director rotation , only the quartic term being present in the ideal soft case .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 measures semi - softness , that is the residual harmonic elastic resistance . in elastomers and gels",
    ", the director has a bulk as well as surface anchoring  there is an elastic resistance even when directors are rotated uniformly ( equivalent to a massive , finite - energy @xmath20 normal mode ) .",
    "one sees that the uniform system would rotate in response to an electric field only when the threshold @xmath21 is exceeded , a characteristic field rather than voltage because of the bulk anchoring .",
    "additional effects arise from gradients of @xmath5 in order to satisfy the boundary conditions and from the necessity for the sample to preserve its overall mechanical shape , but the main effect is captured by the above argument .",
    "we shall describe both effects in this paper , first addressing the response of a uniform system and then examining the role of constraints and non - uniform deformations .",
    "we start with a model of a macroscopically uniform sample of nematic elastomer in which the director is aligned parallel to the plane of a dielectric cell . when subjected to an electric field perpendicular to the cell plane ( assuming positive anisotropy @xmath1 ) , the director is forced to rotate upwards towards homeotropic alignment as in the `` traditional '' fredericks effect . we assume for simplicity that the director rotates in the @xmath22-@xmath23 plane and",
    "is parameterized by an angle @xmath16 , which is a function of coordinate @xmath23 only , @xmath24 , but not of @xmath22 , just as in a classical fredericks transition ( see figure [ fig1 ] )",
    ". mechanical constraints of ( i ) rubber incompressibility and ( ii ) elastic compatibility then impose strong limitations on the number and types of possible elastic deformations .",
    "since the director orientation is coupled to the elastic network , director rotation in the @xmath22-@xmath23 plane causes deformations @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( and @xmath27 from the incompressibility constraint @xmath28 ) , and especially the shears @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "all these components of strain are possibly functions of @xmath23 . there are restrictions due to mechanical ( in fact , geometric ) compatibility @xcite , which can be expressed in the following simple way .",
    "since the deformation ( cauchy strain ) tensor is a derivative @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being positions of a material point initially and after deformation , then one can obtain the second derivative in two possible ways : @xmath34    making some elements @xmath35 functions of @xmath23 induces others to be functions of @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , consider the component of shear @xmath36 : we have @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ the extension @xmath26 must be a function of @xmath22 , which we assumed prohibited . hence @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , assuming the local extension @xmath39 leads to @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath41 , another prohibited @xmath22-dependence .",
    ". however , incompressibility demands that @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the constant extensional strains in the cell plane lead to the conclusion that @xmath44 as well . analyzing the strain tensor , we come to the conclusion that in a constrained cell geometry depicted in figure [ fig1 ] the only possible elastic deformation is the shear @xmath29 , a possible function of @xmath23 .",

    "the highly swollen network used in the experiments @xcite ( up to 90% solvent ) may well have a much lower modulus ( as will be indeed confirmed in section  [ s6 ] ) .",
    "also , as we shall see below , the scaling depends on the important polymer anisotropy @xmath68 too , so that the materials with small backbone chain anisotropy have , in fact , a stronger response to electric fields .    in spite of the obvious non - linearity of the effective free energy density ( [ f1 ] )",

    "the analysis of the previous section assumes that there is no relevant spatial variation in either @xmath48 , or @xmath105 : the solution for @xmath69 , equations ( [ sin2 ] ) and ( [ te2 ] ) , has been obtained without taking into account the director - gradient frank elasticity .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption at fields high above the threshold , where the texture is coarsened and the bulk is capable of achieving its optimal value of @xmath16 , equation ( [ sin2 ] ) , which we shall call @xmath106 ( similarly , for the conventional fredericks effect @xmath107 and the profile @xmath108 coarsens at high fields ) . near the threshold one has to be more careful and",

    "the expression in parentheses is the corresponding right - hand side for the conventional fredericks effect , with no underlying rubber elasticity @xmath12 and @xmath123 ( and with the half- rather than full - period of director oscillation across the cell thickness ) ; it depends on a voltage @xmath124 .",
    "the real threshold is shifted from that of the uniform analysis of last section , equation ( [ ec ] ) , by the additional contribution from the domain walls ( which is the only contribution in the conventional fredericks effect ) : the solution of ( [ eta ] ) first appears at the minimal value of @xmath125 at @xmath126 , i.e. @xmath127 : e^ * .",
    "[ estar ] one should note that the analysis of the threshold itself is elementary and does not require the investigation of the elliptic function . in the usual way , we could introduce a variation of wave vector @xmath128 @xmath129 whereupon the expanded free energy density ( [ landau ] ) is @xmath130 .",
    "modulation starts when the @xmath131-coefficient becomes negative for the first time , whence the threshold condition ( [ estar ] ) is recovered",

    "as discussed below , effects observed in thin samples suggest that the effective rubber modulus , @xmath136 , is low in the studied material .",
    "although this may in part be because @xmath12 is small due to dilution by solvent , it clearly indicates that @xmath19 is small too .",
    "if the effect were simply due to the smallness of @xmath12 alone , then the quartic terms would also be weakened and the saturation field @xmath137 would also be accessible . because @xmath19 is evidently small , it may be possible to see the remaining @xmath6-dependence of the apparent threshold in experiment and compare it with ( [ estar ] ) .",
    "there seems to be no reason to assume a systematic obliqueness ( pre - tilt ) in the initial director .",
    "however , the preparation of networks , especially in thick cells , results in a residual polydomain texture , as reported by chang _",
    "_ and is a well - established phenomenon in nematic gels . even after orientation by strong magnetic fields one should expect a small degree of remaining random disorder , see @xcite . assuming the degree of this misalignment is small , it is straightforward to make provisions for it and obtain the resulting quenched averages of observable parameters , such as the director angle @xmath138 and the optical path @xmath139 .",

    "we now apply the model of the previous sections to the experimental observations of chang _",
    "@xcite , in light of further experiments performed recently . the analysis of data performed by chang _ et al . _",
    "includes a bulk anchoring effect similar to that proposed here , which produces a threshold field , rather than voltage .",
    "however , they also appealed to an intrinsic material length scale on the order of micrometers , which further increases the observed threshold field and also sets the scale for director gradients , which limit the director rotation above threshold .",
    "they reported observations of micrometer scale speckles in the sample after polymerization in support of this proposed length scale , but did not directly observe a periodic pattern of director rotation at the micrometer scale in response to the applied electric field .",
    "we prepared a series of samples of different thicknesses according the the methods of chang _",
    "et al . _ , and performed microscopic observations during application of the field . in thick samples , comparable to those of @xcite , we observed the same general elements of response that they reported , but in addition , we were able to observe small scale movements in the sample , particularly displacements of microscopic particles and speckles in the sample .",
    "we observed lateral displacements in the plane of the sample on the order of a fraction of the sample thickness , and saw no evidence of micrometer scale deformations in response to the field .",
    "our observations are consistent with the deformation sketched on the right in figure  [ fig1 ] , which involves a combination of shear strains resulting in lateral displacement of material in the midplane of the sample .",
    "the deformation proposed on the right in fig .  [ fig1 ] also satisfies the preservation of symmetry in the conoscopic image reported by chang _",
    "et al . _ , in contrast to the rotation of the optical axis that would accompany the classical half - wavelength fredericks transition .",
    "thus , the field response proposed here is completely consistent with the general observations reported by chang _",
    "moreover , as described in the previous section , the pretransitional response , or rounding of the transition , observed by chang _",

    "the values of semi - softness parameter @xmath19 and of the random local pretilt angle @xmath146 are sufficiently small not to contradict the known facts about liquid crystalline gels .",
    "the value of backbone anisotropy @xmath73 , slightly higher than that reported for solvent free polyacrylate elastomers ( @xmath150 1.44 @xcite ) , is likely due to the large amount of nematic solvent present in the gel and increasing the nematic field .",
    "the solvent ( up to 90% ) can also explain the very small value of rubber modulus @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , it is mostly due to this weakness of swollen elastic network that we can observe a noticeable director rotation , the angle of which depends on a ratio @xmath151 .",
    "however , in spite of this plausibility , independent measurements of these parameters are needed to test the presented theory more explicitly .",
    "the value of the gel modulus @xmath12 , used in the fitting above , is substantially lower than that expected for ordinary rubbers .",
    "it necessitates re - examination of the characteristic length scales in our system .",
    "the natural nematic elastomer scale @xmath152 ( see eq.([landau ] ) and , more comprehensively , the review @xcite ) is now of the order @xmath153 m .",
    "this scale gives the characteristic thickness of domain walls , two of which are present in the full - wavelength fredericks geometry , fig .",
    "hence one expects that thin samples , with @xmath6 only of order of several micrometers , should deviate from the description proposed here : in thick samples , our electro - mechanical response is driven by a reduction in electrical energy because of director rotation toward the field with very little elastic penalty , since the deformations are soft in the uniform regions above and below the midplane .",
    "these regions are separated by a domain wall in the middle , where the shear strain reverses sign .",
    "when the sample thickness is reduced , this wall and the two non - uniform regions near the cell boundaries would start merging .",
    "this raises the elastic energy of the full - wavelength ( nematic elastomer - like ) frederiks transition above that of the half - wavelength ( liquid nematic - like ) one .",
    "indeed , in thin samples ( 8 to 25 micrometers in thickness ) , we observed the different response , almost identical to the ordinary half - wavelength fredericks transition .",
    "this was evident in the conoscopic observations , by the rotation of the optical axis in response to the applied field , as in low - molar mass nematic liquid crystals .    to satisfy the boundary conditions with this fully non - uniform director rotation",
    ", the predominant shear strain in the bulk of the sample must be zero . the energy penalty and the counter - torque for the action of electric field",
    "are then provided by eq.([frub ] ) with @xmath154 .",
    "this is the regime of `` couples without strains '' , with a bulk barrier for the director rotation , first proposed by de gennes @xcite .",
    "more detailed experimental measurements and theoretical analysis will be carried out to explore this kind of transition in thin samples , and to determine the thickness at which the crossover from thin to thick behavior occurs .",
    "this will provide a detailed understanding of the combined director and shear strain structure within the boundary layers and give an independent measure of the effective rubber modulus @xmath12 via the characteristic length scale @xmath155 .",
    "another aspect that needs to be re - examined for a system with very low modulus @xmath12 is the threshold condition , eq.([estar ] ) . in order to predict the field threshold @xmath145 , rather than the voltage @xmath156",
    ", we need to maintain the inequality @xmath157 . for the values used in fitting the experimental data in fig.5 ( for the smaller @xmath158 )",
    "we still obtain a ratio of order @xmath159 and the conclusions about the threshold remain valid .",
    "however , this ratio will become of order unity for @xmath160 m , where the ordinary voltage threshold should again become relevant .",
    "in summary , we propose a model for the fredericks transition in nematic polymer gels . especially for thick samples ,",
    "the polymer network serves both to set the threshold field for the transition , and to control the director response above threshold .",
    "it effectively replaces the role of the sample surfaces in the ordinary nematic fredericks transition .",
    "we can reasonably explain the experimental results of chang _",
    "_ without appealing to a new internal length scale for director gradients , and this element of our explanation is supported by qualitative experimental observations of macroscopic lateral displacements in response to the applied field .    because two coupled physical fields , the director angle @xmath16 and the shear strain @xmath29 , are at play , it is possible that there are two different characteristic timescales for relaxation . depending upon the disparity of these , one could at short timescales possibly see another decay regime before the final , slowest exponential decay reported by chang _",
    "et al._. this obtains naturally from the numerical solution of the dynamical equations in @xmath161 and @xmath29 resulting from eq.([f0 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have begun to examine the remaining role of director and shear strain gradients in the sample , and our experimental observations suggest that this is important for understanding the transition in thin samples .",
    "much experimental work remains to be done to test various aspects of our model .",
    "finally , it is interesting to compare these predictions for nematic gels with the behavior of polymer - stabilized liquid crystals .",
    "the key difference is the permanently fixed macroscopic polymer skeleton of the pslc system , in contrast with the mobile molecular scale network of a gel .",
    "the detailed analysis of the threshold , director evolution at higher fields and the role of alignment conditions at preparation should distinguish between the behavior of these two systems .",
    "the dynamic behavior is especially different , with gels responding very slowly , compared to pslc s .",

    "in the classical electric fredericks problem the anisotropic dielectric fluid is contained between two parallel plates kept at a relative voltage @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the analysis can easily be generalized to the elastic - electric case .",
    "one needs to use the electric displacement vector @xmath163 , which is a constant between the plates given no space charge ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the field @xmath60 and the displacement @xmath61 are related by @xmath165 . as all nematic uniaxial tensors , the matrix of dielectric constants is expressed as @xmath166 , where the nematic director is the principal axis .",
    "the voltage is , therefore , given by the integration @xmath167 : v= _ 0^d dz , [ volt ] where @xmath168 . the correct free energy , now per unit area of plates , does not derive from equation ( [ f0 ] ) , but from the dielectric energy density @xmath169 : f & = & _ 0^d dz [ a1 ] + & & _ 0^d dz  -    , where @xmath170 is the rubber - nematic part of free energy density , given by equation ( [ frub ] ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation giving the @xmath171 minimizing this free energy is : k  = + ( ) ( ) [ a2 ] where the constant @xmath61 has to be determined from equation ( [ volt ] ) and is thus a functional of @xmath48 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath172 at @xmath173 if there is a modulation with amplitude @xmath115 .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) is easily integrated once to give : ( ) ^2 = 2(g(^2 ) -g(^2 _ m ) ) + ( - ) , [ a4 ] where @xmath174 is the length reduced by the rubber - nematic correlation length @xmath152 .",
    "the full problem is solved by further integrating over 1/4 period and yields : _",
    "0^_m = [ a5 ] where @xmath175 $ ] is the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) . the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) is a quarter period of the modulation . integrating eq ( [ a4 ] ) to a general @xmath16 at a general @xmath23 , rather than to @xmath115 and @xmath176 as in eq .",
