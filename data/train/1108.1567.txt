    "study of quantum interference ( qi ) had led to the discovery of numerous fascinating phenomena in various type of systems ranging from atoms to biomolecules @xcite . in atomic systems for example ,",
    "one of the earliest known effect of qi is the modification of the absorption profiles that comes about due to interference among the bound - bound and bound - continuum transitions , a phenomenon now called fano interference @xcite .",
    "agarwal @xcite later showed how qi among decay pathways can lead to generation of coherence and population trapping in a multi - level atomic configuration .",
    "a counter - intuitive application of such _ agarwal - fano qi _ was discovered by harris in the form of inversion - less lasing ( lwi ) @xcite .",
    "this non - energy conserving phenomena had thereof lead to several theoretical investigations @xcite and experimental demonstration  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , during the past decade study of qi effects has been extended to tailored semiconductor nanostructures like quantum wells and dots due to coherent resonant tunneling owing to their potential applications in photo - detection @xcite , lasing @xcite , quantum computing and quantum circuitry @xcite .    in the seminal work of scully @xcite",
    "it was shown that coherence induced by external source can break the detailed balance between emission and absorption and enhance , in principle , the quantum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell .",
    "ref @xcite demonstrated the role of quantum coherence in a simple way . in a recent work we showed that coherence induced by qi",
    "can enhance the power of the photocell and laser quantum heat engines @xcite following the earlier work on photo - carnot engine enhanced by quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the quantum coherence induced by either an external drive or qi among the decay paths alters the detailed balance between emission and absorption and can enhance the efficiency of the system compared to that without quantum coherence . in the case of photovoltaic cells",
    "quantum coherence leads to suppression of radiative recombination @xcite or enhancement of absorption @xcite and thus , increase of the efficiency .",
    "furthermore , the results of the ref . @xcite have initiated debates about the principle issues . in his article @xcite kirk attempts to investigate the limits of ref .",
    "@xcite and , in particular , argues that fano interference does not break detailed balance of the photocell .",
    "note , that noise induced coherence via fano interference was later shown to indeed enhance the balance breaking in photovoltaics where it leads to increase in power @xcite .",
    "these investigations have hence generated renewed interest in the fundamental question of noise induced interference effects on the emission and absorption profile of an atom or atom like system ( excitons in quantum wells or dots ) @xcite .",
    "as such , we in this paper undertake a thorough theoretical investigation of the vacuum induced interference effects on the resonance line profiles of a three level system with doublets in ground ( excited ) state configuration ( see fig .",
    "our analysis is quite general and applies to atoms , molecules as well as quantum wells and dots .",
    "we study the time profile of absorption and emission probabilities and derive its close form expression in the steady state regime . in the present work we use a simple probability amplitude method to calculate the resonance profiles since the states involved in calculation have zero photon occupation number .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the density matrix formalism usually used in this type of problems @xcite .",
    "the probabilities of emission and absorption are found to have strong functional dependence on the the energy spacing between the doublets ( @xmath0 ) and interaction strength @xmath1 . in the case of atomic system @xmath1",
    "is governed by a mutual orientation of dipole moments . in semiconductor systems",
    "@xmath1 has a meaning of the phase shift acquired by the wave function between two interfering pathways .",
    "this thus provides us with two different parameter by which we can regulate the qi in the system .",
    "for example , we show that depending on the choice of energy spacing between the doublets compared to spontaneous decay rate we can use destructive interference to achieve either lwi by enhancing the emission or photodetectors and interferometers by reducing emission and enhancing absorption .",
    "moreover depending on the @xmath1 we can manipulate the interference type from destructive to constructive which can significantly alter the resonance profiles ( see fig .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our theoretical model of three - level system with the doublet in the ground state and calculate the expression for the probability of emission @xmath2 and absorption @xmath3 in the long time limit @xmath4 . furthermore , we also give results for emission and absorption probabilities for a three - level configuration with upper state doublet . in section iii , the functional form of the ratio @xmath5",
    "is presented to quantify its dependence on the dipole alignment parameter @xmath1 , energy spacing @xmath6 and the radiative decay rates @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss our results and propose potential application of our model to enhancement of emission in lwi configuration , enhancement of absorption for photodetectors , measurement of high to moderate magnetic field intensities and observation of qed results on quantum beats in the semi - classical regime . finally in section",
    "iv we conclude by summarizing our findings .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of qi on the emission and absorption profile of an atomic , molecular or semiconductor system we consider a three level configuration with a ground state doublet @xmath8 and excited state @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "the three level system is excited by coherent field with the central frequency @xmath10 so that the energies of state @xmath8 are related to @xmath9 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 half of the energy spacing between the ground state doublet .",
    "the ground state doublet @xmath8 decays to the reservoir state @xmath13 with the rate @xmath14 respectively and the excited state decays to the reservoir state @xmath15 with the decay rate @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , states @xmath8 can represent either zeeman sub - levels in atoms , vibrational levels within electronic band in molecules or intrasubband in semiconductor . since the typical relaxation rate of electronic ( intersubband ) transition is much smaller than that of vibrational ( intrasubband ) , we neglect direct decay process between level @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that the decay of ground state doublets @xmath8 to the same state @xmath17 leads to a vacuum induced coherence among them .",
    "the physics of this coherence is attributed to the _ agarwal - fano qi _ of the transition amplitudes among the decay pathways .",
    "note that analysis presented below is valid for the system with excited state doublet @xmath18 and single ground state @xmath19 ( as per fig.1b , see discussion ) .",
    "we will show later that such qi plays a major role in the line profiles of an atomic system  @xcite . the time dependent amplitudes of the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 essentially exhibits the effect of coherence on the dynamics of the system .",
    "the probability amplitude method can be applied in the present system since states @xmath8 and @xmath9 have zero photon occupation number . solving the time dependent schrdinger equation ,",
    "the dynamical evolution of the probability amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 of finding system in corresponding states @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( i.e. states with zero photons ) in weisskopf - wigner approximation is given by    [ fig:3levvv ]     while the excited ( ground ) state to the reservoir is @xmath16.,scaledwidth=49.0%,height=230 ]    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the respective rabi frequencies and dipole moments of the corresponding transitions @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the amplitude of the applied electric field .",
    "the term @xmath29 arises due to qi of the decay pathways of the ground state doublet .",
    "it is clearly seen from the above set of equations that this term for @xmath30 couples the amplitudes of the states @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "such a coupling is known as _ agarwal - fano coupling _ in the literature @xcite and have several implications ranging from superradiance @xcite and entanglement @xcite to quantum solar cells @xcite .",
    "the interference strength is typically determined in terms of the relative orientation of the dipole moments of the decay transitions and is given by coefficient a @xmath1 as , @xmath33    [ fig:3levvv ]        where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the dipole moment corresponding to the transition @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively with @xmath38 exhibiting the maximal interference among the decay paths . here",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to the two dipole moment vectors parallel to each other on the other hand when they are anti - parallel @xmath40 .",
    "non - orthogonal dipole moments in optical transition have been generated using superposition of singlet and triplet states due to spin - orbit coupling in sodium dimers  @xcite . more generally , interference strength @xmath1 is a phase shift acquired by wavefunction between initial and final states . equations ( [ eq : a2])-([eq : b ] ) can be written and solved in the dressed basis using the approach developed by scully @xcite as discussed in appendix a for general @xmath1 and in the presence of additional decay rates @xmath41 .",

    "( [ eq : pabs01 ] ) yields that probability of emission and absorption can vary substantially in the presence ( @xmath58 ) or absence ( @xmath59 ) of interference .",
    "so far we have discussed a model with doublet in the ground state .",
    "let us now consider doublet in the excited state ( as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in practice",
    "this configuration is commonly used in semiconductor systems like quantum wells and dots .",
    "the expression for the probability of emission and absorption in case of excited state doublet can be obtained as follows .",
    "if we start with @xmath60 , the probability of emission is given by @xmath61 similarly the probability of absorption from @xmath19 yields @xmath62 the expression for the emission and absorption probability can be calculated by following a procedure similar to that outlined in appendix b for the ground state doublet . in the long time",
    "limit @xmath4 , we find that the expression for emission and absorption probabilities obtained from eqs.([uemiss])-([uabs ] ) reduces to eqs.([eq : pabs01 ] ) and ( [ eq : pemiss0 ] ) respectively .",
    "_ applications to lasing without inversion and photodetectors _ : the model discussed in the previous section is relevant for the design of the systems with nonrecpirocal relation between emission and absorption . for instance , suppressed absorption or / and enhanced emission in the laser systems allows for operating without population inversion . on the other hand enhanced absorption with suppressed emission can results in the photodetector or photovoltaic / solar cell system with enhanced power output @xcite .",
    "both lwi and photodetector schemes can be realized in atomic molecular and semiconductor systems . in atoms",
    "agarwal - fano type qi can arise between decay channels from magnetic sub - levels . in molecular systems on the other hand , decay pathways of different vibrational / rotational levels",
    "lead to asymmetric absorption / emission profiles due to interference . in the case of semiconductors ,",
    "agarwal - fano interference comes about quite naturally in a system of two quantum wells or dots grown at nanometer separations @xcite .",
    "the tunneling / frster interactions among the wells / dots renormalizes the bare energies and bare states of the system thereby creating new eigenstates which then reveals the interference in decay channels through tunneling to the same continuum @xcite .",
    "note that qi and coherence effects in semiconductors are strongly effected by the presence of dephasing environment and hence experiments in these systems are carried out at very low temperatures ( 10 k ) .",
    "this thereby restrict their practical feasibility for various applications involving qi . however , recently quantum dot photodetector enhanced by fano - type interference assisted with metallic hole array was reported operating at 77 k @xcite . hence in near future realization of fano like qi effects in nanostructure and its various applications might be achievable even at room temperatures .    to put the above ideas to prospective , we discuss the functional dependence of the of emission and absorption probabilities on the interference strength @xmath1 and the level spacing @xmath12 in the steady state and transient regime .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the steady state behavior and temporal evolution of emission and absorption probabilities for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath12 . figures in the upper panel ( 2a , b , c ) correspond to large level spacing compare to spontaneous decay rate @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the steady state emission profile is seen to be strongly influenced by the strength of qi .",
    "it varies from its minimum at @xmath39 to maximum at @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "2a ) . the enhancement in emission is found to be almost 10 fold .",
    "however for absorption the effect of interference is not significant as @xmath1 varies from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath67 one can achieve regime with largest emission , which can be useful in inversionless lasing schemes . on the other hand at @xmath39 , as emission reaches its minimum , it is attractive in realization of photo - detectors and photovoltaic devices . note , that in semiconductor double quantum well system , control over @xmath1 can be achieved by manipulating of the width of the shallow well @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the resonance profiles shown in fig . 2b and 2c exhibits oscillatory behavior in the emission and absorption probabilities .",
    "period of oscillations is determined by the frequency @xmath68 and thus strongly depend on the level spacing .",
    "we see further that the oscillations gets damped with time and the probabilities eventually reaches the steady state .    for small level spacing @xmath69 ( @xmath70 )",
    ", the situation becomes less trivial . in this case the behavior of emission and absorption profiles is depicted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 ( d , e , f ) ) . in the steady state",
    "the both the probabilities varies significantly with the interference strength @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "we find that while absorption probability increases monotonically from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , emission is seen to first increase until about @xmath73 beyond which it rapidly decreases to reach the minimum value at @xmath72 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the behavior of the emission probability for large @xmath12 . in the time dependent profiles ( fig .",
    "2e , 2f ) we find that in comparison to the case of large splitting both emission and absorption probabilities show no oscillations and reach their steady state values that depend strongly on the interference strength .",
    "furthermore , interesting case arise at @xmath40 where emission profile first reaches its maximum and then drops down to the steady state that has the smallest value compare to other @xmath74 . in the same time absorption profile at @xmath40",
    "reaches its maximum value at steady state .",
    "note that in contrast to that , for large splitting at @xmath40 emission has its maximum ( see fig .",
    "therefore , not only interference strength determines the emission and absorption profile , but the level spacing itself has strong impact .",
    "namely , for fixed value of @xmath1 , for example @xmath40 , large level spacing @xmath12 yields the strongest emission ( see fig .",
    "2b ) which is in favor of lasing process . in the same time for small level spacing the emission",
    "is strongly suppressed while absorption reaches its maximum ( see figs . 2e , f ) , which is perfect situation for photo - detection and photocell operation .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting , that despite the asymmetry between curves for @xmath75 in fig .",

    "( [ eq : rat ] ) yields for @xmath82 result that is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "namely for no interference , i.e. @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ eq : rat ] ) yields @xmath83 , while for parallel alignment @xmath39 it yields @xmath84 . on the other hand the case of antiparallel alignment ( @xmath40 )",

    "( [ eq : rat ] ) gives @xmath86 , while for @xmath63 and @xmath87 the result is @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the present analysis not only confirms that destructive interference can alter the detailed balance but also exhibits that by controlling two parameters .",
    "namely by adjusting the interference strength @xmath1 and energy spacing @xmath12 , one can regulate the ratio between emission and absorption probabilities in the system .",
    "this possible manipulation of @xmath1 and @xmath12 hence also suggest that in the same system with two lower ( upper ) levels one can induce either suppression of emission @xcite or absorption @xcite , respectively . the later choice governed by level spacing @xmath12 can be also controlled externally either by adjusting the current through the junction , or by manipulating the magnetic field in hyperfine splitting  @xcite . in fig 4 .",
    "we have plotted the effect of @xmath12 on the temporal evolution of the probability of emission .",
    "the results show that the oscillations in the probability varies with the increase of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , for fixed @xmath12 and @xmath49 the number of oscillations is governed by rate @xmath89 since probability decays as @xmath90 . for interference strength @xmath1 , control can be achieved by a tailored variation of the quantum well widths @xcite . summarizing the proposed scheme with lower doublet",
    "can be applied to the system that requires emission ( absorption ) suppression or enhancement and thus is very attractive for both : light emitting devices , such as lwi and light absorbing photodetector systems .    .",
    "for numerical simulation we took , @xmath77 , @xmath91.,scaledwidth=46.0%,height=170 ]    _ quantum beats in semiclassical picture : _ besides broad range of applications , interference effects and in particular its sensitivity to the level spacing discussed in the present work are related to fundamental question about the applicability of semiclassical theory in quantum problems .",
    "semiclassical description ( sct ) can predict self - consistent and physically acceptable behavior of many physical systems and explain almost all quantum phenomena .",
    "however it is not always correct .",
    "for instance , the phenomena of quantum beats has substantially different result if considered in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed)@xcite .",
    "namely , for different configurations of three - level systems : for instance @xmath92and @xmath93 schemes ( see fig . 5 ) that are initially prepared in a coherent superposition of all three states sct description predicts the existence of quantum beats for both schemes , whereas qed theory predicts no quantum beats in the case of @xmath93 scheme .",
    "the explanation of the phenomenon is quite straightforward and based on quantum theory of measurements . in the case of @xmath92 scheme the coherently excited atom decays to the same final state @xmath19 starting from @xmath94 and @xmath95 and one can not determine which decay channel was used .",
    "therefore this interference that is similar to the double - slit problem leads to the existence of quantum beats .",
    "however in the case of @xmath93 scheme that has also two decay channels : @xmath96 and @xmath97 , after a long time the observation of the atom s final state ( @xmath98 or @xmath99 ) will determine which decay channel was used .",
    "in this case we do not expect quantum beats .",
    "three - level systems with doublet in the ground state or excited state is in a way similar to the @xmath93 and @xmath92 types of atom respectively .",
    "therefore we can also study the quantum beats effect in those systems . note that in the model of fig .",
    "1 we have additional radiative decays of states which guarantees that system can reach a steady state within finite amount of time .",
    "[ fig : qbeats ]     as a function of dimensionless time @xmath100 for three - level system with doublet in excited state - ( dashed line ) and for three level system with doublet in ground state - ( solid line ) calculated numerically according to eqs .",

    "however , for the case of doublet in the ground state ( @xmath93 scheme ) with small spacing @xmath104 the probability of emission does not process any quantum beats and smoothly reach the steady state",
    ". therefore , phenomenon of fano interference has a potential to resolve the fundamental question about an applicability of the semiclassical description to the problem of quantum beats .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we investigated the effect vacuum induced qi on the emission(absorption ) profile of a three - level system with a doublet in the ground or excited state ( see fig .",
    "we show that qi can enhance the balance breaking between emission and absorption .",
    "we use probability amplitude method , since the states involved in calculation have zero photon occupation number .",
    "furthermore , our findings are in full agreement with the results obtained by density matrix formalism .",
    "we observed that the interference strength @xmath1 governed by the phase shift between the decay pathways play a crucial role on the emission(absorption ) dynamics of the system .",
