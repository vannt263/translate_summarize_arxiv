    "the motion of a non - abelian charged particle in a classical non - abelian gauge field as described many years ago by the wong equations @xcite has been studied for its theoretical interest @xcite and in attempts to describe the phenomenology of the strong interactions @xcite .",
    "more recently a study of the non - abelian landau problem @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , a quantum particle confined to a plane and subjected to a static and homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field @xcite , has shown that the effects of specific choices of non - abelian gauge potentials corresponding to homogeneous coloured magnetic fields could account for the presence of rashba @xcite and dresselhaus @xcite spin - orbit interactions .",
    "applications of similar models have been recently analyzed in the context of fractional quantum hall effects @xcite , and non - abelian anyons @xcite .",
    "these results have revived the interest in studying the motion of coloured particles in non - abelian backgrounds .",
    "undoubtedly the non - abelian landau problem is a particular example of the motion of a coloured point particle in an external yang - mills gauge field . at the classical level",
    "this motion is governed by the wong equations , generalizing ordinary cyclotron motion in the case of an electromagnetic field .",
    "inspired by the potential application of supersymmetry in condensed matter physics @xcite , the consequences of having in addition a supersymmetric invariant realization of the quantized system corresponding to the motion of a coloured particle in a classical external static non - abelian gauge field are studied in the present work .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite addressed , in a classical formulation , the @xmath0 supersymmetric wong equations for a spin @xmath1 particle in an non - abelian background gauge field .",
    "the present work considers the case of a particle with arbitrary spin in a unitary ( irreducible ) representation of a compact gauge group .",
    "furthermore , a canonical quantization of the classical formulation is constructed .",
    "subsequently , as a particular illustration , the spectrum of the @xmath0 supersymmetric non - abelian landau problem is obtained in the specific case of a spin @xmath1 particle in a non trivial static non - abelian background magnetic field .",
    "finally , the inclusion of an electric potential term is discussed in the appendix .",
    "a typical problem is the motion of a charged particle in @xmath2 spatial dimensions subjected to a generic static non - abelian gauge potential .",
    "its classical dynamics is governed by @xmath3 where we have introduced additional complex variables @xmath4 that will be specified hereafter while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary time independent background fields ( @xmath7 ) . for simplicity",
    "we take a compact gauge group , with hermitian generators , @xmath8 , whose algebra is @xmath9=\\rmi f^{abc}t^{c}$ ] . by construction",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under local space dependent gauge transformation , which includes a transformation of the background fields , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a group element with space dependent parameters @xmath12 , obtained by exponentiation of the elements of the algebra : @xmath13 . in order to introduce the supersymmetric formulation we define the hermitian supercharge and superderivative @xmath14 which anticommute with each other while @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the supersymmetric formulation requires the introduction of the real grassmann odd coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore it is customary to define the real supercoordinate @xmath18 with @xmath19 where the variable @xmath20 is odd .",
    "the infinitesimal supersymmetric transformation of @xmath21 of grassmann odd parameter @xmath22 is @xmath23 , so that the components transform as @xmath24 with the help of these definitions we readily find that the kinetic term @xmath25 is contained in the expression @xmath26 by construction , the last expression transforms by a total derivative under an infinitesimal susy transformation .",
    "we briefly recall the reason why this is so . as a general rule the grassmann integral of a superfield @xmath27 selects @xmath28 .",
    "the highest component @xmath29 has the property of transforming by a total derivative under supersymmetric transformations . indeed , the transformation @xmath30 is such that we can identify the transformation rule @xmath31 .",
    "this construction produces a natural candidate for the supersymmetric extension of the original lagrangian .",
    "henceforth we will consider @xmath4 to be a grassmann even complex variable , in a ( complex ) representation of the `` gauge '' group .",
    "the case of a grassmann odd variable can be developed in parallel with our analysis .",
    "the complex supercoordinate containing @xmath4 reads @xmath32 whose components transform under supersymmetry as @xmath33      respecting gauge invariance requires particular care .",
    "here we consider a background with vanishing electric potential while appendix a shows how to generalize the formulation to include an electric potential , @xmath34 .",
    "inspired by the supersymmetrization in the abelian landau problem and references @xcite , we define the natural candidate @xmath35 , for the analogue of the vector superfield .",
    "the components of @xmath36 are @xmath37 where @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "henceforth the gauge index of the representation is kept implicit . in this @xmath40 dimensional problem , there is no need to impose a `` wess - zumino '' gauge due to the small number of components .",
    "however we still need to investigate the gauge transformation properties of the vector superfield in order to define an invariant action . in the case of a @xmath41 gauge group @xcite ,",
    "the gauge transformation of the vector superfield is @xmath42 where the superfield @xmath43 is real and reads @xmath44 so that @xmath45 it is straightforward to extend the transformation for the case of the su(n ) gauge group .",
    "the non - abelian transformation of the vector superfield @xmath46 when written in its infinitesimal form , @xmath47 , reads @xmath48\\\\ & = \\lambda_{i}(x_{i})(\\partial_{i}\\lambda(x_{i})+f^{abc}\\lambda^{a}(x_{i})a^{b}_{i}(x_{i})t^{c})\\\\ & \\quad -\\theta\\big\\{\\dot{x}_{i}(\\partial_{i}\\lambda+f^{abc}\\lambda^{a}(x_{i})a^{b}_{i}(x_{i})t^{c})\\\\ & \\quad + \\rmi\\lambda_{i}\\lambda_{j}\\partial_{j}(\\partial_{i}\\lambda(x_{i})+f^{abc}\\lambda^{a}(x_{i})a^{b}_{i}(x_{i})t^{c})\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] providing the desired result . besides",
    ", the gauge transformation of the variable @xmath49 is @xmath50 and therefore the supersymmetric extension is easily guessed . the gauge transformation , of parameter @xmath51 valued in the lie algebra representation , of the superfieds @xmath52 and @xmath53 is @xmath54 the supersymmetric generalization of the third term of the lagrangian @xmath55 is straightforwardly written in components @xmath56 furthermore the complete expression whose first term provides the supersymmetric variation of @xmath57 is @xmath58 , and , according to , gives @xmath59 . at first sight , the last expression for the lagrangian is not manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "however the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 have no dynamics and hence are auxilliary .",
    "the elimination of these variables by their equations of motion gives @xmath62\\}u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is explicitly invariant under a non - abelian gauge transformation provided the background field @xmath63 is transformed as well according to .",
    "finally we notice that the results obtained are not explicitly real but we provide a remedy by considering instead @xmath64^{\\dagger}u+u^{\\dagger}(-d+v)u\\big\\ }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the supersymmetric variation becomes @xmath65 , vanishing when the equations of motion are satisfied . in conclusion",
    ", the supersymmetric action @xmath66 reads in components @xmath67 the non - abelian field strength @xmath68 $ ] transforms under gauge transformation by a conjugation , so that @xmath69 a gauge invariant expression . the variation of this lagrangian under supersymmetry @xmath70 gives rise to a surface term in the action , when the equations of motion hold .",
    "the supersymmetry charge is readily found to be @xmath71 .",
    "the introduction of additional variables @xmath72 for @xmath19 provides an alternative formulation of the action @xmath73 the last action being already in the so - called first order hamiltonian form we take advantage of its convenient form to read off the hamiltonian @xmath74 as well as the grassmann graded poisson ( or dirac ) brackets @xmath75 a straightforward analysis of constraints following the dirac algorithm @xcite reaches the same conclusions . in the hamiltonian formalism the supercharge @xmath76 generates the infinitesimal supersymmetry transformations through the poisson brackets .",
    "the transformations @xmath77 correspond up to a sign to the ones in and . as is very well known the supercharge is a square root of the hamiltonian : @xmath78 , where the curly brackets denote poisson brackets .",
    "in accordance with the correspondence principle we proceed to canonical quantization by introducing the following commutators and anti - commutators : @xmath79=\\rmi\\hbar\\delta_{ij},\\quad [ u;u^{\\dagger}]=\\hbar , \\quad\\ { \\lambda_{i};\\lambda_{j}\\}=\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\delta_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] henceforth all curly brackets @xmath80 will denote anticommutators .",
    "in addition we introduce conveniently `` normalized '' operators @xmath81 , satisfying a clifford algebra @xmath82 in euclidian signature .",
    "the algebra of the `` non - abelian charges '' : @xmath83=\\rmi\\hbar f^{abc}i^{c}$ ] , where @xmath84 , contains an additionnal factor @xmath85 with respect to the lie algebra considered at the beginning .",
    "the hamiltonian operator easily follows @xmath86 the convenient notation @xmath87 $ ] renders manifest the fact that we deal with a spinor representation of @xmath88 .",
    "the operator corresponding to the supercharge @xmath89 is also the square root of @xmath90 , as readily shown after a short algebra : @xmath91 .      as an illustration",
    "we discuss the particular case corresponding to the problem of a particle confined in a plane in a non - abelian homogeneous magnetic field . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the @xmath92 gauge group ( with @xmath93 ) and consider the fundamental representation of @xmath94 . representing the @xmath95 sector with the help of pauli matrices ( @xmath96=2\\rmi\\sigma_{12}=2\\rmi\\sigma_{3}$ ] ) , we find that the hamiltonian takes the suggestive form @xmath97 in order to study the corresponding landau problem @xcite , let us choose the non - abelian vector potential @xmath98 , leading to the non - abelian magnetic field @xmath99 .",
    "consider then the fock operators ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath100 with the cyclotron frequency @xmath101 .",
    "we introduce the `` chiral '' oscillators @xmath102 which verify the fock algebra @xmath103=1 $ ] , defined through the expressions @xmath104 therefore the phase space operators @xmath105 can be expressed in terms of @xmath102 .",
    "these notations prove themselves to be appropriate in order to rewrite the quantum supercharge @xmath106 where we defined the ladder operators @xmath107 satisfying @xmath108=\\pm\\hbar\\sigma_{3}$ ] .",
    "the fermionic fock operators used above are defined by @xmath109 and @xmath110 and satisfy @xmath111 .",
    "the particular representation of the @xmath112 algebra considered here is that of `` spin '' @xmath1 : @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath115 matrix representation of the fermionic fock algebra enables to recover the structure of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xmath116 where @xmath117 as a result the quantum hamiltonian @xmath118 manifests a more tractable structure that we elaborate further .",
    "it is the customary to name the operators @xmath119 and @xmath120 the bosonic and fermionic hamiltonians , respectively . considering the eigenvalue problem for the bosonic and fermionic hamiltonian",
    ", it is well known that an eigenstate @xmath121 of non - vanishing eigenvalue for the bosonic hamiltonian has a superpartner eigenstate of the fermionic hamiltonian @xmath122 associated to the same eigenvalue . as a matter of fact the case of an eigenstate with vanishing eigenvalue needs to be considered separately .",
    "the bosonic hamiltonian @xmath123 possesses a zero - energy eigenstate provided by the condition @xmath124 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 are normalised chiral fock states .",
    "nevertheless the fermionic hamiltonian @xmath120 does not have a zero - energy eigenstate so that @xmath127 has no superpartner . in consequence the reminder of the spectrum",
    "is found among the non vanishing eigenvalues of the bosonic hamiltonian @xmath128 it is a straightforward exercise to obtain the non vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath129 : @xmath130 for @xmath131 , associated to the eigenstates @xmath132 where @xmath133 is an appropriate normalization .",
    "finally the eigenvectors of @xmath134 given by @xmath135 correspond to the same non zero eigenvalues , as is expected because of supersymmetry .",
    "note how each of these energy eigenvalues are doubly infinitely degenerate , corresponding to the supersymmetric extension of the ordinary landau levels , except for the lowest landau level which is @xmath136 supersymmetry invariant and of zero energy eigenvalue .",
    "given the present construction of the @xmath136 supersymmetric generalization of the wong equations , within the restriction to the @xmath92 gauge group we discussed the supersymmetric structure of the spectrum of a particular case : the non - abelian landau problem .",
    "the relevance of this model to low dimensional materials exhibiting spin - orbit interactions may be investigated . besides its phenomenological interest the landau problem illustrates important modern mathematical developements , such as non - commutative geometry . as a perspective",
    "the projection of the dynamics on selected landau levels and an investigation of the ensuing consequences of supersymmetry on the non - commutative planar euclidian geometry may be carried out .",
    "the work of mf is supported by the national fund for scientific research ( f.r.s .- fnrs , belgium ) through a `` aspirant '' research fellowship .",
    "this work is supported by the belgian federal office for scientific , technical and cultural affairs through the interuniversity attraction pole p6/11 .",
    "as a generalization , it is possible to include in the lagrangian a scalar potential term : @xmath137 , where we restrict ourselves to the case of a bosonic @xmath49 .",
    "the chromo - electric potential @xmath138 is valued in the lie algebra of the gauge group .",
    "the results obtained below can probably be found by considering the non relativistic limit of the model for a spinning particle in a background field with @xmath139 supergravity , as studied in @xcite . in the present work",
    "we obtain the supersymmetric action from the superspace formalism .",
    "to do so we define in addition the real grassmann odd superfields @xmath140 and @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are real fermions , and @xmath144 , @xmath145 are real bosons . with the help of these supercoordinates ,",
    "we build @xmath146 whose highest component @xmath147 contains the term @xmath148 after solving the equation of motion for @xmath145 .",
    "the result is @xmath149 the role of the variable @xmath143 is now clear , it is the conjugate momentum of @xmath142 . the complete lagrangian obtained from the highest component of the superfield @xmath150^{\\dagger}u+u^{\\dagger}(-d+v)u\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & -yu^{\\dagger}a_{0}(x_{i})u+\\lambda(dy-1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 , and takes the following form in components    @xmath152    in order to make the expression explicitly invariant under time independent gauge transformations we solve the equations of motions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and we obtain @xmath153 with the `` chromo - electric '' field @xmath154(x_{i})$ ] . within the hamiltonian analysis ,",
    "the dirac bracket @xmath155 is straightforwardly obtained and the classical supercharge is then given by the expression @xmath156 which verifies @xmath157 with @xmath158",
