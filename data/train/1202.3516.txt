    "it has been realized since the pioneering work of @xcite that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) located at the centers of galaxies assemble their mass predominantly through accretion , an inference that has been further reinforced from considerations of the cosmic x - ray background ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , how smbhs are fueled remains an outstanding unsolved issue .",
    "the spin of smbhs traces the angular momentum of the accreted material . as such",
    ", it can serve as a powerful cosmic probe of smbh feeding . however , spin is highly elusive to measure since its general relativistic effects emerge in the very vicinity of the horizon ( typically within a few tens gravitational radii ) . according to standard accretion disk theory , the radiative efficiency of energy conversion is closely linked to black hole spin through the marginally stable orbit , which is a function of the spin .",
    "the binding energy of the material in the accretion disk is locally radiated , and , after crossing the marginally stable orbit , the material freely falls into the hole without losing further energy due to the torque - free condition there . as a result ,",
    "the total amount of energy converted into radiation is the binding energy between the marginally stable orbit and infinity ( @xcite ) . specifically , the radiative efficiency increases monotonically with black hole spin ( e.g. , see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this link allows us to analyze the net angular momentum of the accreted gas by quantifying the radiative efficiency , and hence obtain clues on how smbhs are fed . by presuming a fixed radiative efficiency , @xcite connected the mass growth rate of smbhs with the luminosity function ( lf ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "subsequent studies explored the cosmic growth of smbhs by comparing the local smbh mass density with the integrated energy density of agns across time ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also a review of @xcite ) .",
    "these studies found that an average radiative efficiency of @xmath7 yields a local mass density consistent with observational constraints . from the theoretical point of view , if the angular momentum of the accreted material stays aligned with the spin axis of of the black hole and the direction remains unchanged , the black hole will be rapidly spun up to a maximally rotating system and attain a radiative efficiency of @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inconsistency between this estimate of @xmath9 and that based on sotan s argument potentially intimates that episodic transitions of angular momentum of accreted material during the active phases of black holes ( i.e. random accretion ) may play an important role in the cosmological evolution of smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus expected that the spin of smbhs , and hence their radiative efficiency , evolves with redshift .",
    "@xcite constructed a formalism to determine the evolution of the radiative efficiency , which depends completely on observables .",
    "when applying this formalism to survey data , they found that smbhs are spinning down with cosmic time since @xmath10 .",
    "such an evolutionary trend of spins suggests that smbh growth is driven by episodic random accretion .",
    "since different smbh populations may undergo different accretion histories , it is important to verify whether the spin evolution depends on black hole mass .",
    "this can give further insights into how smbh activity is triggered and how the angular momentum of the accreted material ultimately influences smbh spin .",
    "deep surveys in the x - rays and in other bands have established that agn activity exhibits cosmic downsizing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . generally , the space density of agns with low luminosity peaks at lower redshift than that of agns with high luminosity .",
    "two distinct scenarios can result in such luminosity evolution .",
    "if black holes are accreting at near - eddington luminosity once they become active , downsizing can be caused by activity shifting toward low - mass black holes at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , downsizing can result from a decrease of the average accretion rate onto black holes at low redshift ( @xcite ) ; in other words , the entire black hole population shines with high eddington ratio at high redshift and then slowly fades out over time .",
    "these two scenarios can be tested using information on black hole demographics .",
    "studies of local agn samples unambiguously find that local active black holes are typically an order of magnitude less massive than the typical inactive black holes residing in normal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "using the virial method to measure the black hole masses of sdss quasars out to redshift @xmath11 , @xcite show that the maximum mass of the active black hole population notably increases with redshift .",
    "these observations seem to suggest that cosmic downsizing arises from activity shifting over mass . recalling that the angular momentum carried into the black hole along with mass accretion changes the black hole spin",
    ", we may expect that the spin evolution of black holes would follow a behavior similar to that of the redshift evolution of agn activity .",
    "assuming that smbhs grow mainly through accretion , we extend the study of wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to explicitly show the mass - dependent behavior of the cosmic evolution of smbh spin . in section 2",
    ", we construct a generalized equation that expresses the radiative efficiency as a function of black hole mass and redshift .",
    "section 3 shows the eddington ratio distribution used in our calculations , and section 4 derives the smbh mass function of agns , including compton - thick sources .",
    "we then present the results for smbh growth in section 5 and smbh spin evolution in section 6 .",
    "the implications of our results on accretion scenarios are discussed in section 7 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 8 .    throughout the paper , we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the smbh mass function , including both active and inactive black holes , which specifies the number of black holes per unit comoving volume and per unit mass at cosmic time @xmath16 .",
    "its evolution is described by a continuity equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath17    = s(t , \\mbh),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mean mass accretion rate for inactive and active smbhs with mass @xmath19 at time @xmath16 , and @xmath20 is the source term that accounts for black hole mergers . as in most previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we neglect black hole mergers , setting @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite investigated the importance of black hole mergers on the evolution of the smbh mass function and concluded that the effect of mergers is minor compared with mass accretion .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite also verified that mass accretion dominates over mergers in determining the mass growth and spin distribution of black holes .",
    "the radiation power of a smbh with mass accretion rate @xmath22 is @xmath23 . because of radiative losses , the mass growth rate of the smbh is @xmath24 , yielding @xmath25 . here",
    "the eddington ratio is defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , @xmath29 is the proton mass , @xmath30 is the light speed , and @xmath31 is the thomson electron scattering cross section . with the help of the duty cycle of smbhs , @xmath32 , the mean mass accretion rate can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean eddington ratio determined from observations ( see equation [ equ_mean_ratio ] below ) .",
    "the duty cycle is usually defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the smbh mass functions of galaxies and agns , respectively , and , accordingly @xmath38 combining the above equations , we rewrite the continuity equation @xmath39 , \\label{equ_con}\\ ] ] where and hereinafter we substitute the cosmic time @xmath16 with the corresponding redshift @xmath40 . integrating equation ( [ equ_con ] ) over @xmath41 from @xmath19 to @xmath42 , we obtain the radiative efficiency @xmath43 where the agn luminosity density is @xmath44 and we use the boundary condition @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ equ_eta ] ) is the generalized @xmath46equation of wang et al .",
    "the underlying rationale of this generalized @xmath46equation lies in the assumption that mass accretion only increases the smbh mass , but keeps the smbh number density conserved .",
    "subsequently , variations of the smbh number density in the interval @xmath47 $ ] should come from the `` inflow '' of smbhs through the boundary @xmath48 due to mass accretion . as a result",
    ", we obtain the radiative efficiency for smbhs with any given mass of @xmath19 from the agn luminosity density .",
    "to solve equation ( [ equ_eta ] ) , it is imperative to obtain three ingredients that appear on the right - hand side : the smbh mass functions of normal galaxies and agns , and the eddington ratio distribution . in the first paper of this series ( @xcite , paper i )",
    ", we have derived the smbh mass function of normal galaxies out to @xmath49 using the latest galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions . in what follows",
    ", we show in detail how to obtain the smbh mass function of agns from the observed eddington ratio distribution .",
    "observations thus far have not yet reached a consensus on the observed eddington ratio distribution , especially at high redshifts .",
    "the challenges arise from systematic uncertainties in measuring black hole mass using the virial relation and the flux limit of surveys .",
    "however , among earlier studies , two types of eddington ratio distributions are preferred .",
    "generally , the observed eddington ratios derived from the bright agn ( quasar ) samples exhibit a log - normal distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , those derived from samples that include fainter sources or low - luminosity agns display a power - law distribution and/or an additional log - normal component in the high - eddington ratio regime ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the peak and dispersion of the log - normal distribution are found to be almost independent of luminosity and redshift ( @xcite ) . through analysis of the properties of the host galaxies selected from sdss",
    ", @xcite argued that in the log - normal regime black holes self - regulate their growth in environments with a plentiful supply of cold gas , so that the eddington ratio is retained at a universal rate independent of luminosity ( black hole mass ) and the properties of the host galaxies .",
    "by contrast , in the power - law regime the gas has run out and the central black holes are probably being fueled by mass loss from stars in the bulges , thereby appearing as low - luminosity agns @xcite .    with the above lines of observations , we employ two types of eddington ratio distribution in our calculations .",
    "we express the log - normal distribution as @xmath50       d\\log\\lambda , \\label{equ_lognormal}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the logarithm of the peak eddington ratio and @xmath52 is the dispersion .",
    "below we will show how to determine @xmath51 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath52 is found to be inessential to our results , and we set @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power - law distribution is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normalization , @xmath56 is the characteristic ratio , @xmath57 is the power - law index , and @xmath58 is the lower cut - off ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . according to their feedback - regulated model , @xcite",
    "suggest typical values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in our calculations , we set @xmath61 and @xmath62 as fiducial values .",
    "note that for the power - law distribution , a lower cut - off @xmath58 is required to completely determine the normalization @xmath55 . we adjust the values of @xmath58 so that the calculated smbh mass function of agns matches the observed one .",
    "@xcite derived the mean eddington ratio for a given black hole mass and redshift from the observed eddington ratio distribution .",
    "for clarity , we present the details here .",
    "the smbh mass function of agns is calculated by combining the observed eddington ratio distribution and the agn bolometric lf as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the agn bolometric lf .",
    "applying bayes theorem , the eddington ratio distribution for a given black hole mass @xmath19 is @xmath65 the mean eddington ratio of agns with @xmath19 at redshift @xmath40 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 .    in figure",
    "[ fig_agnmf ] , we compare with observations the smbh mass function of agns calculated by equation ( [ equ_nagn ] ) using two types of eddington distributions . to delineate the evolution of the agn populations , we adopt hopkins et al.s ( 2007 ) bolometric lf , which combines a large set of agn lf measurements in the rest - frame optical , soft and hard x - ray , and near - ir and mid - ir bands , spanning a range of bolometric luminosities from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite measured the local smbh mass function of broad - line agns from sdss using standard virial relations .",
    "based on the same method , @xcite compiled the smbh mass function of broad - line agn samples drawn from the large bright quasar survey , the bright quasar survey , and sdss , covering a range of redshift from the local epoch up to @xmath70 .",
    "note that the turnover toward the low - mass end of the mass function of @xcite is due to the incompleteness of the surveys .",
    "@xcite carefully estimated the incompleteness of the sdss sample of @xcite and found that it is highly incomplete for @xmath71 at @xmath72 . since these measurements just cover the unobscured population of agns , a correction factor has to be applied to equation ( [ equ_nagn ] ) to account for such a selection bias before performing this comparison ( see section 4 below ) . by fine tuning the value of @xmath51 for the log - normal distribution of eddington ratio , we find that @xmath73 produces an agn smbh mass function that is in excellent agreement with the observed ones , particularly for the data of @xcite at @xmath74 , as shown in figure [ fig_agnmf ] .",
    "similarly , a value of @xmath75 for the power - law distribution also gives an almost identical mass function .",
    "however , it is probably unphysical that the eddington ratio for the power - law distribution is cut off at @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless , whichever type of eddington ratio distribution is used has very little influence on the final results in the sense that the resultant agn smbh mass functions are very insensitive to the actual choice ( see figure [ fig_agnmf ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we only use the log - normal distribution in our calculations .",
    "figure [ fig_lambda ] shows the dependence of the mean eddington ratio on black hole mass and redshift .",
    "we find that the mean eddington ratio roughly spans values in the range @xmath76 , slightly increasing with redshift and decreasing with black hole mass .",
    "these trends between the mean eddington ratio and black hole mass and redshift are due to the power - law shape of the agn lf and the redshift evolution of the slope of the power law . at the same time , we know that nearby massive active galaxies generally contain black holes accreting at an eddington ratio substantially below unity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this does not conflict with the present results , considering that local luminous agns are quite rare .",
    "moreover , we here focus on efficient accretion phases with high eddington ratios , during which black hole growth predominately happens ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the eddington ratio distribution and agn bolometric lf , it is trivial to calculate the smbh mass function for agns using equation ( [ equ_nagn ] ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that different bands are subject to different selection biases .",
    "optical lfs miss obscured agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while hard x - ray surveys ( @xmath77 kev ) can trace only agns that are not completely compton - thick ( e.g. , @xcite ) , namely sources with column densities @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite recently presented an evolution model for agns hosted by galaxies undergoing major mergers and find that compton - thick sources play an important role in the mass growth of smbhs .",
    "meanwhile , evidence is mounting from deep x - ray surveys , in combination with ir surveys , that the population of compton - thick agns with intermediate luminosities is of the same order as that of compton - thin agns ( sources with @xmath80 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "population synthesis models of the cosmic x - ray background also predict the existence of a large number of compton - thick agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how the fraction of compton - thick agns evolves with redshift is not well known .",
    "even the overall evolution of compton - thin agns is in debate . after correcting for selection bias in their hard x - ray - selected agn sample spanning the redshift range @xmath81 , @xcite",
    "find that the fraction of obscured agns increases with redshift as @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite , modeling the x - ray background , also report a similar evolution trend of @xmath84 .",
    "however , other studies cast doubt on the redshift evolution of the obscured agn fraction ( @xcite ) . based on their agn population model , @xcite",
    "argue that by including a proper @xmath85correction an intrinsically constant obscured agn fraction can also represent the data .",
    "motivated by the above results , we parameterize the redshift dependence of the fraction of compton - thick for all agns as @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . here we determine @xmath89 by assuming that the local fraction of obscured ( compton - thin and compton - thick ) to unobscured agns is @xmath90 ( @xcite ) , and that there is an equal abundance of compton - thin and compton - thick sources .",
    "as described later , our final results are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath91 ; therefore , we set @xmath92 , consistent with @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand , it is well established that the obscured fraction of compton - thin agns decreases with luminosity ( @xcite ) . the dependence of obscuration on luminosity for compton - thick agns , however , is still poorly understood .",
    "we neglect this effect , but we discuss the implications in section 6.2.3 .",
    "with the agn smbh mass function determined from the previous sections , we can calculate the agn duty cycle , as shown in figure [ fig_duty_cycle ] . at low redshifts ,",
    "the duty cycle decreases with increasing black hole mass , indicating that the fraction of galaxies that are active also declines with mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , as a consequence of the cosmic downsizing of agn activity , at high redshifts the duty cycle reverses trend and increases with black hole mass .",
    "duty cycles for @xmath93 and @xmath94 black hole are @xmath95 and @xmath96 at @xmath74 , respectively , but rise up to @xmath97 and @xmath98 by @xmath99 . as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_duty_cycle ] , the active fraction of all black holes increases significantly from @xmath100 at @xmath74 to @xmath101 at @xmath99 , in concert with the feature of agn lf that displays a rapid rise up till @xmath99 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "with the duty cycle determined , the active time of agns is simply given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath40 ( @xcite ) . as a result , the active time of agns is of the order of @xmath104  yr in the local universe and @xmath105  yr at @xmath99 .",
    "this is consistent with the observational estimates from other methods ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "figure [ fig_udot ] illustrates the agn luminosity density @xmath106 , defined by equation ( [ equ_udot ] ) , and its variation with redshift for different black hole masses .",
    "since the mean eddington ratio is approximately constant over black hole mass and redshift , @xmath106 just reflects the evolution of the agn smbh mass function .",
    "again , the behavior of cosmic downsizing is evident : more massive active black holes reach their maximum number density earlier than less massive ones .    with the mean accretion rate @xmath107",
    ", we can trace the smbh growth history since redshift @xmath108 as @xmath109\\right\\rangle\\frac{dt}{dz'}dz',\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the initial black hole mass at redshift @xmath108 .",
    "figure [ fig_growth ] plots the growth history of black holes with initial masses @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 @xmath115 at @xmath116 . the symbols ( squares and circles ) indicate when the black hole mass has @xmath117-folded once and twice . for a hole with an initial mass of @xmath93",
    ", it grows to @xmath118 at @xmath119 , @xmath117-folding roughly 3 times .",
    "a @xmath120 hole grows just to @xmath121 at @xmath119 , @xmath117-folding only once .- folding times and mass growth rates are qualitatively consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that these studies assumed a constant radiative efficiency . ] recall that the @xmath117-folding time is quantified by the salpeter ( 1964 ) time @xmath122 it is obvious that the @xmath117-folding time scales in proportion to the radiative efficiency .",
    "the decline of radiative efficiency makes black hole growth possible , especially for low - mass black holes at low redshift , considering that the agn life time is of the order of @xmath123  yr at that epoch ( see also the discussions of @xcite ) .",
    "an intriguing issue that has attracted much attention over the years is what is the mass range of seed black holes and how they grow to present - day smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , an extrapolation of the present approach to much higher redshifts , say @xmath124 , may be helpful to place constraints on the properties of seed black holes .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we defer this investigation to future work .",
    "in figure [ fig_eta_mbh ] we present the radiative efficiency , calculated using equation ( [ equ_eta ] ) , as a function of smbh mass , using the smbh mass function derived from both the galaxy lf and the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "shaded areas represent typical errors of @xmath125 dex from the smbh mass function ( @xmath126 dex ) and agn lf ( @xmath127 dex ) .",
    "we find that at low redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath128 ) smbh of all masses are accreting material with a relatively low radiative efficiency . at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) ,",
    "although the uncertainties are large , the radiative efficiency generally increases with black hole mass .",
    "a rough correlation is @xmath130 , with @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , @xcite argued on the basis of the sotan argument that the radiative efficiency should increase with black hole mass so as to guarantee that the mass function of local relic smbhs matches the mass function of galaxies .",
    "previous studies , assuming a fixed radiative efficiency over black hole mass and redshift , concluded that @xmath132 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the radiative efficiency we obtain here are consistent with this average value .",
    "the redshift dependence of the radiative efficiency is plotted in figure [ fig_eta_z ] for different black hole masses .",
    "solid lines show the results obtained using the smbh mass function derived from the galaxy lf , while the superposed data points make use of the smbh mass function derived from the galaxy stellar mass function , computed for specific redshift bins . again",
    ", shaded areas and error bars represent typical errors of @xmath125 dex . for high - mass black holes ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the radiative efficiency maintains a high value of @xmath133 at @xmath134 , but then strongly declines toward lower redshifts .",
    "the radiative efficiency for @xmath135 at @xmath136 marginally exceeds the maximum efficiency of @xmath137 allowed for extreme kerr black holes .",
    "this may arise from the unrealistic treatment of the mean eddington ratio distribution beyond a black hole mass of @xmath138 .",
    "another cause may be an overestimate of the correction factor for compton - thick agns in equation ( [ equ_ct ] ) , if the factor is generally anti - correlated with luminosity . for low - mass black holes ,",
    "the evolution is more complicated .",
    "the radiative efficiency appears to plateau at @xmath129 and then decreases dramatically toward @xmath74 .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained the average radiative efficiency for black hole masses @xmath139 with redshift @xmath140 .",
    "they found a similarly rapid decrease of @xmath9 from @xmath136 to the local epoch ( see their figure 2a ) .",
    "figure [ fig_growth ] shows how the black hole mass and the associated radiative efficiency evolve over time .",
    "interestingly , there exists a peak in the efficiency curve : for a given initial mass at redshift @xmath141 , the efficiency gently rises to a local maximum , and then sharply falls off .",
    "the rise of the efficiency during black hole growth is due to the positive correlation between efficiency and mass , as shown in figure [ fig_eta_mbh ] , while the subsequent decline is due to the systematic decrease of the efficiency toward low redshifts .",
    "it seems that the efficiency evolution can be characterized by two regimes , one during which the efficiency increases and another during which it decreases .",
    "if the standard accretion disk model applies to the agns under consideration , we can elucidate their spin evolution through the radiative efficiency obtained above ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since black holes gain their mass predominately during their quasar phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the standard accretion disk model is quite a reasonable approximation . from figure [ fig_eta_mbh ]",
    ", it is apparent that at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) black hole spin increases with mass . at low redshifts",
    "the dependence of spin on mass seems reversed , although large uncertainties prohibit us from reaching a firm conclusion .",
    "volonteri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have drawn a connection between black hole spin and galactic morphology and argued that smbhs in elliptical galaxies possess higher spins than those in spiral galaxies .",
    "such a morphology - related spin distribution has been used to explain the observed radio - loudness bimodality in nearby agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results at @xmath142 are not qualitatively consistent with this scenario .",
    "one possible explanation for this inconsistency is that radio - loud galaxies comprise only a tiny fraction of the galaxy population , whereas our results pertain to a global average of all galaxies .",
    "moreover , our current approach is unable to constrain the dispersion of the spin distribution at any given redshift or mass .",
    "most importantly , figure [ fig_eta_z ] shows that high - mass black holes begin to spin down earlier than low - mass black holes . to guide the eye ,",
    "the vertical dotted lines in the figure mark the redshift below which the efficiency begins to decline . recalling the cosmic downsizing of agn activity , there appears to be a connection between black hole spin and accretion .",
    "indeed , if random accretion plays a role in black hole growth , spin evolution inevitably follows cosmic downsizing just as agn activity does , since high - mass black holes become active earlier and hence are spun down earlier by random accretion .",
    "however , we observe two regimes in the evolution of the radiative efficiency : smbhs first spin up , and then down .",
    "this indicates that more complex accretion scenarios need to be explored .",
    "we return to this point in section 7 .",
    "we explore the reliability of the radiative efficiencies in light of some of the assumptions used in our calculations .",
    "the smbh mass function is a crucial input because it determines the mass growth rate in equation ( [ equ_eta ] ) . in paper",
    "i , we derived the smbh mass function of galaxies out to redshift @xmath136 using the latest luminosity and stellar mass functions of field galaxies to constrain the masses of their spheroids .",
    "smbh masses were inferred through a locally calibrated empirical correlation between black hole mass and spheroid mass .",
    "the smbh mass functions derived from the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions show very good agreement , both in shape and in normalization , testifying to the robustness of our results .",
    "after carefully examining various sources of uncertainties , we found that the total uncertainties on the smbh mass function are generally within @xmath126 dex , and possibly even smaller for lower mass black holes ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "as a consequence , uncertainties in the smbh mass function introduce an uncertainty less than @xmath126 dex to the resultant radiative efficiency .",
    "the observed distribution of eddington ratios is described as log - normal , independent of luminosity and redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a distribution may be realistic in the context of a self - regulation model for accretion of black holes embedded in a gas - rich environment ( @xcite ) . to assess its impact on our results , we calculate the radiative efficiency for three values of the mean eddington ratio ( logarithmic values @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) and its dispersion ( @xmath52 = 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 ) for @xmath145 ( figure [ fig_error_ratio ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath51 does have a mild impact on the redshift position where black hole spin begins to decline : smaller @xmath51 results in a later decrease of spin .",
    "however , in comparison with figure [ fig_eta_z ] , the adopted uncertainty of @xmath146 does not alter the overall cosmic downsizing behavior for the spin evolution .",
    "future systematic studies should try to directly constrain the intrinsic eddington ratio distribution for a given black hole mass , instead of inferring it from the observed eddington ratio distribution combined with the agn lf .",
    "the dispersion of the log - normal distribution @xmath52 has only a very minor influence on the radiative efficiency .",
    "we adopt a simple , redshift - dependent correction factor to account for the selection bias of compton - thick agns in hopkins et al.s ( 2007 ) bolometric lfs ( equation [ equ_ct ] ) . its possible dependence on luminosity is neglected . from equation ( [ equ_eta ] )",
    ", it is apparent that a higher correction factor would enhance the energy density and therefore lead to a larger radiative efficiency ( see also @xcite ) . by analogy ,",
    "if obscuration anti - correlates with luminosity , the radiative efficiency of low - mass black holes will be reduced .",
    "this will influence the relation between spin and mass obtained in figure [ fig_eta_mbh ] .",
    "unfortunately , the overall luminosity dependence of the fraction of compton - thick agns remains unsettled still ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , precluding us from applying a rigorous treatment .",
    "figure [ fig_error_ct ] shows the influence of the correction for compton - thick agns on the radiative efficiency for @xmath120 holes .",
    "the results are significantly affected by the normalization factor @xmath147 , but they are quite insensitive to the redshift parameter @xmath91 . in any case , the overall evolution trend of radiative efficiency is qualitatively preserved .      as in most previous works",
    ", we neglect the term for black hole mergers in the continuity equation and , motivated by sotan s argument , assume that black hole growth is mainly driven by baryon accretion .",
    "as mentioned above , previous studies show that mass accretion dominates over mergers in determining the mass growth and spin distribution of black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , using theoretically predicted merger rates from hierarchical structure formation models , also conclude that the effect of mergers is minor compared with mass accretion .",
    "however , based on a semi - analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution incorporating black hole growth , @xcite recently showed that mergers do contribute significantly to the final black hole mass for high - mass black holes ( e.g. , @xmath148 ) .",
    "both of these calculations are subject to the uncertainties of the adopted recipes for merger rates of black holes , which are not well understood yet .",
    "several recent parallel studies have attempted to observationally estimate smbh radiative efficiency or spin . directly starting from the definition of radiative efficiency",
    ", @xcite obtained the efficiencies of individual sources in a sample of 80 palomar - green quasars using the bolometric luminosity and the accretion rate determined from accretion disk model spectral fits .",
    "they found an average @xmath7 and a trend of increasing efficiency with increasing black hole mass ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift range of their sample is confined to @xmath149 .",
    "the correlation of the radiative efficiency with black hole mass found by @xcite is not completely compatible with our results ( i.e. redshift bins @xmath150 and @xmath151 in figure [ fig_eta_mbh ] ) , although both calculations suffer from large uncertainties .",
    "another common but highly model - dependent way to constrain smbh spin is through the jet / radio power of radio - loud agns . in a series of works",
    ", @xcite analyzed the radio beam power using large samples of extended radio sources and then determined the black hole spin with the aid of a correlation between the beam power and spin .",
    "their results generally suggest that black hole spin in radio sources decreases moderately from redshift @xmath49 to the local universe .",
    "conversely , assuming that the efficiency of jet production is uniquely dependent on black hole spin , @xcite inferred the spin distribution by modeling the radio luminosity function of radio sources with high- and low - excitation narrow emission lines .",
    "they found that the best - fit spins show a bimodal distribution , whose peaks correspond to the high- and low - excitation radio sources , respectively . in particular , their model favors a trend in which the typical black hole spin increases slowly toward low redshift since @xmath152 . a follow - up study by @xcite , based on a similar method , gave an even steeper evolutionary trend of black hole spin from @xmath153 to @xmath4 . in terms of spin evolution ,",
    "our results obtained here are qualitatively consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "however , the stark differences between the results of daly and martnez - sansigre & rawlings suggest that approaches that rely on the radio power to deduce black hole spin should be treated with caution .",
    "a number of semi - analytic models of galaxy formation have attempted to incorporate the growth of black holes and track their spin evolution .",
    "although the prescriptions for implementing gas fueling from large to small scales are uncertain and differ from study to study , there is broad consensus that the final black hole spin strongly depends on the assumed configuration of the angular momentum of the accreted gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite predict that the average black hole spin increases with mass . at first glance , this is qualitatively consistent with our results at high redshifts .",
    "however , they ascribe their results to the major mergers of black holes , which exclusively produce remnant holes with high spin ( @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations , by contrast , explicitly neglect black hole mergers and assume that mass accretion dominates black hole growth . we contend that this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "indeed , many recent studies cast doubt on the importance of the role played by major mergers in the evolution of galaxies in general ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , and active galaxies in particular ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , especially for redshifts below @xmath49 .",
    "two possible accretion scenarios affect black hole spins ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( 1 ) smbhs grow through _ prolonged _ accretion episodes , during which the holes are quickly spun up to their maximum rate by capturing material with constant angular momentum ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) smbhs grow via many _ short - lived and random _",
    "accretion episodes , acquiring gas with initially random orientations with respect to the rotation axis of the hole , which efficiently cancels out the net angular momentum and leads to moderately rotating holes ( @xcite ) . as in @xcite",
    ", we appeal to episodic , short - lived random accretion as the driving mechanism to explain the intense decline of black hole spins since @xmath154 . the situation may be fundamentally different at higher redshifts ( @xmath155 ) , when galaxies are characteristically more gas - rich and major mergers are more prevalent . at these earlier epochs",
    ", it is natural to expect black hole growth to be more dominated by episodes of prolonged accretion , leading to high spins and high radiative efficiencies , particularly for high - mass systems .",
    "we propose that this is the fundamental explanation for the two regimes of spin evolution seen in our analysis ( figure [ fig_growth ] ) : black holes spin up by prolonged accretion , possibly aided by major mergers , up to @xmath49 , and thereafter spin down by episodic accretion driven by minor mergers and internal secular processes .",
    "random accretion inevitably leaves the accretion disk misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the black hole . in this case , the presence of viscosity combined with lense - thirring precession will induce the inner portion of the disk to align or anti - align its orbital angular momentum with that of the black hole out to a transition radius , beyond which the disk retains its initial inclination ( so - called bardeen - petterson effect ; @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic extension of the transition radius and the time scale for alignment or anti - alignment depend on the black hole mass and spin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect may exert a vital influence on the spin evolution of the black hole ( e.g. , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we defer a complete study of the relation between spin and mass during multiple episodes of black hole growth to a third paper of this series ( y .- r .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "we derive the mass - dependent cosmological evolution of the radiative efficiency for mass accretion , which , according to the standard model of accretion disks , can be used as a surrogate to estimate the black hole spin .",
    "the calculated radiative efficiency generally increases with black hole mass , roughly as @xmath1 at high redshifts ( @xmath156 ) , but the trend reverses at low redshifts , such that @xmath9 increases with decreasing @xmath157 .",
    "high - mass black holes ( @xmath158 ) maintain a high efficiency ( @xmath159 ) at @xmath49 , which then declines strongly toward lower redshifts .",
    "the evolutionary pattern for lower mass black holes is somewhat more complicated , but it is generally consistent with the radiative efficiency decreasing since @xmath153 in like manner .",
    "most importantly , we find that the efficiency of high - mass black holes begins to decline earlier than that of low - mass black holes , qualitatively similar to the cosmic downsizing of agn activity . assuming that the radiative efficiency provides an effective indirect measure of the black hole spin",
    ", we propose the following picture for the spin evolution of smbhs :    * the evolution of the spin of the black hole tracks the growth history of its mass and can be characterized by two regimes : an initial phase of mass accumulation from prolonged accretion that spins up the hole , followed by a period of random , episodic accretion that spins down the hole toward lower redshifts . * the evolution of the spin , like the global pattern of agn activity , exhibits `` cosmic downsizing '' .",
    "relative to lower mass black holes , high - mass systems gain their masses earlier , reach the peak of their agn activity earlier , and begin to spin down earlier .",
    "random accretion dominates their evolution below @xmath5 , whereas lower mass holes transition to this phase later , at @xmath6 .    finally , it is worth listing the principal assumptions used in our calculations , on which better observational constraints would be welcomed : ( 1 ) the scaling relation between smbh mass and the mass of the bulge of the host galaxy applies over the redshift range @xmath160 , so that the smbh mass function can be inferred from the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions ; ( 2 ) black holes gain their mass through baryon accretion and black hole mergers are negligible ; ( 3 ) black hole growth mainly occurs during quasar phases characterized by universal eddington ratio distribution ; ( 4 ) the number of compton - thick agns is comparable to that of compton - thin agns , and they both have a similar eddington ratio distribution as that of unobscured sources .",
    "future deep multiwavelength surveys are awaited to test and refine these assumptions ."
