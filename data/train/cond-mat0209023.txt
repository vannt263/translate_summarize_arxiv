    "ultrathin films produced by quench - condensation under highly reproducible conditions , with extensive atomic scale disorder have been investigated over the past two decades as model systems to study the interplay between disorder , interactions and superconductivity .",
    "more than a dozen single and multi - component systems - al , bi , be , ga , in , pb , sn , nb , mo - c , mo - ge etc ,  @xcite have been shown to exhibit an insulator - superconductor transition as their thickness is increased or disorder is reduced .",
    "the sheet resistance at which the transition takes place , has been observed to vary from @xmath7 3k@xmath5 in mo - c films  @xcite to @xmath7 20k@xmath5 in al on ge  @xcite .",
    "the nature of this transition in the @xmath8 limit has attracted maximum attention  @xcite , with the parameters characterizing the superconducting state having received comparatively lesser attention .",
    "it is also unclear at this point , what the order parameter of this transition is and what similarities in physics , the phenomenon has with metal - insulator transition in 2-deg systems .",
    "most of the reported data on these systems do not show hysteresis in i - v characteristics , the reason being that in most cases they are not probed with currents close to the critical currents of these films .",
    "many physically relevant microstructural parameters can , however , be estimated from the hysteretic i - vs .",
    "+ in this paper we present some experimental results on quench - condensed superconducting films of bi and sn .",
    "the choice of the two materials were dictated by certain experimental considerations , to be discussed below .",
    "earlier studies had classified materials like sn , pb , ga as ` granular ' and bi ( particularly bi quenched on a thin ge - underlayer ) as ` homogeneous ' .",
    "the basis of this classification lay in the rather different resistive transitions to the superconducting state exhibited by these films . in pb ,",
    "ga and sn a metallic phase appears to be sandwiched between the insulating and superconducting phases .",
    "this observation has stimulated the study of a bose - metal phase in the @xmath9 limit  @xcite .",
    "it was first suggested by ramakrishnan  @xcite , that a ` phase - only ' picture was appropriate for the granular films .",
    "destruction of superconductivity in these films was thought to take place by destruction of phase coherence ( via josephson coupling ) between superconducting grains embedded in a non - superconducting matrix . in the homogeneous films",
    "( bi has been taken to be a representative of this class ) on the other hand , destruction of superconductivity was thought to take place via destruction of the amplitude of the wave function . though the resistive transitions ( r - t traces ) as a function of increasing ( decreasing ) thickness ( disorder ) for bi and sn show qualitative difference , we show using experimentally obtained i - v characteristics and computer simulations , that both these systems can be understood as disordered arrays of josephson - junctions .",
    "+ some recent stm studies  @xcite on these films suggest that the structure of the first monolayer of atoms that stick to the substrate may be rather different that the subsequent upper layers .",
    "cluster sizes in the range of were observed in films nominally 10 monolayers thick .",
    "we discuss the relevance of these to the observed properties of our films .",
    "the structure of these films remains a mystery .",
    "recent stm data is an indication of what one may expect , but since it was taken under conditions different from experiments such as those of strongin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , goldman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and this work , comparisons of microstructure should be made with an element of caution .",
    "+ to summarize , there are significant unresolved problems regarding the processes that can lead to formation of such clusters at very low ( @xmath10 10k ) substrate temperatures . landau _",
    "@xcite pointed out that formation of structures such as those reported by valles _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , require that incoming atoms be able to perform @xmath4 500 hops before they finally settle to their positions .",
    "this order of diffusivity is much more than what incoming atoms striking cold substrates are believed to have , although such a possibility can not be ruled out .",
    "we have not addressed this question , but show that several properties of the superconducting state in these films may be understood if we accept the presence of superconducting and non - superconducting regions in close proximity in the film , a case of microstructure similar to that reported by valles _",
    "et al . _",
    "our model bears a close resemblance to the ` percolation - type ' model used by meir  @xcite in describing the m - i transition in 2-deg , and has been discussed in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were done in a uhv cryostat , custom designed for _ in - situ _ study of ultrathin films , described in our earlier publications  @xcite .",
    "a turbomolecular pump , backed by a oil - free diaphragm pump , provided a vacuum better than 10@xmath11 torr .",
    "the substrate was either a - quartz or crystalline sapphire , mounted with adequate thermal contact on a copper cold - finger , in contact with a pumped helium bath .",
    "the lowest attainable temperature was 1.8k .",
    "the material ( _ e.g. _ bi .",
    "sn ) was evaporated from a pyrolytic boron nitride crucible in a knudsen - cell ( effusion cell ) of the type used in mbe .",
    "the temperature of the cell was carefully controlled to give a steady deposition rate between 1 - 5@xmath12/minute .",
    "the required temperatures were 650 @xmath13c for bi and 1150 @xmath13c for sn . +",
    "two hall - bar type masks defined the sample , the actual sample size was 6 mm x 1 mm . one of the samples had a pre - deposited ge underlayer of @xmath7 10@xmath12 thickness .",
    "this geometry enables us to evaluate the claim that ge underlayers may significnatly improve the wetting properties of the films , and the possibility that there may be screening effects due to the presence of an underlayer of a dielectric constant larger than that of the substrate .",
    "the metal flux reached the sample through carefully aligned holes in successive cryo - shields cooled by liquid helium and nitrogen .",
    "these shields also reduce the heat load on the sample and provide cryopumping , for better vacuum in the neighbourhood of the sample . electrical contacts to the films",
    "were provided through pre - deposited platinum contact pads , about 50@xmath12 thick .",
    "four - probe d.c .",
    "measurements were carried out using a standard high - impedance current source and a nanovoltmeter or an electrometer .",
    "the r - t traces of a series of bi films exhibiting the i - s transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ snfilms ] . fig .",
    "[ bi_iv ] shows a typical set of observed i - v characteristics for a film in the superconducting regime .",
    "we can read off the critical and retrapping currents for the whole film .",
    "we claim here ( and demonstrate later ) that this ratio would be nearly same as that of a single junction . for a single junction",
    "we have the exact relation between the josephson coupling energy , charging energy , normal state resistance and the stewart - mccumber junction parameter @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 . with the approximations",
    "stated above , for a film with @xmath17 500@xmath5 and @xmath18 2 , we get @xmath19 70 .",
    "this places the films for which we find a simple empirical relation between the critical current and temperature , well into the regime @xmath20 .",
    "+ the i - v characteristics of a single josephson - junction , in the framework of the rcsj model , is well known and is discussed in several texts  @xcite . if the transfer of a cooper - pair across the junction causes negligible change in the phase - difference ( @xmath21 ) across the junction , then @xmath21 can be viewed as a continuous variable and the i - v characteristics ( neglecting the effect of thermal noise ) can be deduced from eq .",
    "[ jjeq ] . @xmath22 the long time average @xmath23 gives the observed voltage drop .",
    "@xmath24 is the normalized current , @xmath25 , through the junction .",
    "@xmath14 is related to the microscopic parameters of the junction as @xmath26 and also fixes the ratio of the retrapping to critical currents ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath14 , smaller is this ratio and wider the hysteresis .",
    "we first investigate , by computer simulations , whether the hysteresis would persist in a 2-d rcsj array even if all the junction parameters are allowed to have a large distribution of values ( _ i.e. _ in presence of strong disorder ) .",
    "also we need to know whether the observed i - v curve would be significantly altered by the particular type of distribution ( _ e.g. _ square , gaussian , log - normal ) .",
    "we address these questions in the section on computer simulation , the details of which are presented later .",
    "an important fact about a 2-d network of resistances , is the following : not too close to the percolation threshold , the observed resistance , measured between two edges ( see fig .  [ jjarray_sch ] ) , is close to the average value of all the resistances . in a 1-d chain",
    "it is obviously the sum of all the resistances , in a 3-d lattice the measured resistance is much lower than the average .",
    "these can be verified by simple numerical calculations . in 2-d even when the width of the distribution is more than 90% of the mean value , the measured normal state sheet resistance ( @xmath28 ) of the film does not differ from the mean of all the resistances by more than 10% .",
    "we have verified by direct numerical calculation that this result holds good for array sizes down to a 10@xmath2910 array .",
    "if there are @xmath30 junctions in parallel , then the observed critical current of the array would be approximately @xmath30 times the average critical current of one junction .",
    "this allows us to infer some important facts .",
    "this also demonstrates our claim above , that the ratio of the critical current to the retrapping current for an array is the same as that for a single junction in the array . in what follows ,",
    "this will be further substantiated .      if identical junctions were laid out on an array , the i - v characteristics would be indistinguishable from that of a single junction in absence of a magnetic field .",
    "however when there is a large spread in the values of the junction parameters , it is not a - priori obvious what their behaviour will be .",
    "this is because different junctions with different critical currents may undergo transitions at different currents , and for a large array the sharp transition might be broken into many steps and then rounded off by finite temperature effects .",
    "our main result in this regard is that , even in a small array ( 16@xmath2916 ) disorder does not completely destroy the hysteresis- till about 50% disorder ( ratio of width to mean value in a square distribution ) the shape of the i - v loop does not change appreciably .",
    "we have shown the results ( see fig .",
    "[ simulated_iv ] ) , using a square distribution of disorder here , though simulations using a log - normal distribution ( results not shown ) also lead to similar conclusion .      in an array",
    "the algebraic sum of all the currents meeting at any node must be zero - this is required by kirchoff s current law . as shown in fig .",
    "[ jjarray_sch ] , the current is fed uniformly through one edge of the array and extracted through the opposite . in the direction perpendicular to that of current injection ,",
    "we generally use periodic boundary conditions , this is equivalent to joining the remaining two free edges of the array together . from the current conservation equations we get a total of @xmath31 coupled second order differential equations .",
    "the model we are considering neglects the self inductance of the array .",
    "consider a single node , ( not on any of the edges ) at which the phase at some instant is @xmath21 . in the four neighbouring nodes the phases are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 - where the subscripts denote up , left , bottom and right respectively .",
    "every bond will have its characteristic @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 value - since the array is disordered .",
    "we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 to denote the average values . with a little algebra",
    "we can show that the contribution of any link to a node is : +    @xmath39    , where , for a completely ordered array @xmath40 , @xmath41 for all bonds .",
    "adding all the current contributions to a node we get    @xmath42 + \\nonumber \\\\     ( 1/r_l + 1/r_u + 1/r_r + 1/r_b)p & - &      ( p_l / r_l + p_u / r_u + p_r / r_r + p_b / r_b ) + \\nonumber\\\\     ( i_ls_l + i_us_u & + & i_rs_r + i_bs_b ) = 0    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for the nodes on the boundary , there will be three contributions from the three nearest neighbours , the fourth contribution will be @xmath45 , depending on whether current is injected / extracted from the node .",
    "thus we get a total of @xmath31 coupled second order differential equations , where ( @xmath46 ) form a total of 2@xmath31 variables to be updated at each step .",
    "we can visualize the whole set of equations , in a matrix form , as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are column vectors of length @xmath31 each , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath55 matrices . these matrices do not change with time .",
    "however @xmath52 is a singular matrix , irrespective of whether the array is regular / disordered .",
    "this singularity implies that all the variables in the problem are not independent .",
    "this introduces an extra complication in the problem . in mathematical literature such systems of equations",
    "are called `` differential algebraic equations '' ( dae ) .",
    "they occur frequently in lattice related problems .",
    "+ physically it is not difficult to trace the equation of constraint here .",
    "we have written equations for the phase of each junction , whereas only the phase differences are of consequence .",
    "we can add an arbitrary number to each phase ensuring +    @xmath56     + this is achieved by setting all the numbers in any row ( say the last ) of the matrix @xmath52 to be equal to one and the corresponding entry in the column vector @xmath49 to be zero .",
    "the modified @xmath52 is no longer singular and can be inverted .",
    "the set of equations is solved by using a fourth - order runge - kutta method with variable time - stepping  @xcite . + for each current we allow the system to evolve till @xmath57 , the first 500 time units are regarded as stabilization time and discarded . the voltage across the array is then averaged between 500@xmath58 2500 . the value of the external current is then increased by a small amount and the above - mentioned cycle repeated , till the injected current reaches the desired maximum value .",
    "after that it is decremented in identical steps .",
    "the recorded values of the voltage vs drive - current is the response of the array to a cyclic external current .",
    "the @xmath59 curve obtained this way is hysteretic for @xmath601 , as expected .",
    "+ in this algorithm every step requires a large ( @xmath55 ) matrix multiplication .",
    "this requires @xmath61 multiplications for each update of the variables .",
    "assuming that in each step we change the current fed to the array by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the average critical current of each bond , the total complexity of the simulation increases as @xmath64 .      for ordered arrays",
    "the computation can be made much faster , exploiting the special form the matrix @xmath52 takes in such a case .",
    "the matrix @xmath52 is then a `` connectivity matrix '' , the @xmath65 element of the matrix will be -1 , if the sites @xmath66 and @xmath67 are connected by a bond , the diagonal element will give the co - ordination number of the site .",
    "@xcite noted that this particular form of the matrix allows the multiplication to be carried out in @xmath68 steps .",
    "because the eigenvectors of this matrix are of the form @xmath69 , the multiplication with the inverse of the matrix can be viewed as two discrete fourier transforms , amenable to `` fast fourier transform '' techniques .",
    "the technique was improved by dominguez _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite and applied to several array geometries soon after  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this fast algorithm requires that the capacitance of all the bonds be same , even though disorder in @xmath0 and @xmath63 can be handled .",
    "we however need to see the effect of disorder in all the bond parameters .",
    "consequently we had to use straightforward matrix multiplication - i.e. the `` slow '' technique .",
    "we next investigate the temperature dependence of the experimentally measured critical currents .",
    "here we plot the normalized critical current against the reduced temperature .",
    "[ bi_sn_ic ] shows data from several bi films , gathered from different runs and on different substrates .",
    "all the points appear to collapse on a simple power law curve , given by @xmath70 a similar behaviour of sn films is also shown in fig .",
    "[ bi_sn_ic ] .",
    "the critical current of a weak - link is related to the superconducting gap ( @xmath71 ) by the well known ambegaokar - baratoff relation @xmath72 as @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we can expand the tanh term to show that @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests that for these films @xmath71 vanishes as @xmath76 .",
    "near @xmath6 , we have @xmath77 , which is consistent with the behaviour of a bcs gap , as far as the leading power is concerned . however inserting the bcs - result , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath78 ) in the ambegaokar - baratoff relation leads to the well - known prediction that near @xmath6 , the slope ( @xmath79 ) should be 635@xmath80 . for all the bi and sn films studied by us",
    ", we found this slope to be 960@xmath8120@xmath80 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that a similar behaviour of @xmath82 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath83 ) over the entire range of temperature has been observed in fabricated josephson junction arrays  @xcite . in such fabricated arrays ,",
    "one naturally expects the spread of the junction parameters to be quite narrow , and in this sense the disorder is considerably less than that for a random array , such as the quench condensed films we study in this work .",
    "though the data sets are restricted to @xmath84 , in all the experiments , the flattening of the curves allows us to make an extrapolation of the critical current to the @xmath9 limit .",
    "this is important , since @xmath85 is very simply related to the superconducting gap by eq .",
    "[ ab - formula ] .",
    "this relation can be refined further , to account for the presence of disorder , as has been done by kulik and omelyanchuk  @xcite .",
    "in fact , disordered films may show a much better match to the kulik and omelyanchuk form , rather than the ambegaokar - baratoff form . since the kulik and omelyanchuk form comprises recursive functions , no simple expression exists for the dependence of the gap / critical current on reduced temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , the corrections for the presence of disorder to the ambegaokar - baratoff relation , near @xmath86 is within a factor of two , for both the dirty and the clean limits .",
    "this increase for the dirty limit may partly explain the reason for the steeper dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath87 ; observed in this work .",
    "very close to @xmath6 it coincides with eq .",
    "[ ab - formula ] .",
    "as an interesting aside , we mention that dynes _",
    "et al _ have shown in tunneling experiments on quenched sn and pb films  @xcite , that the ratio @xmath88 remains close to 3.5 ( the bcs value ) for sheet resistances upto at least 4k@xmath5 .",
    "the agreement was better for sn than pb , this may be expected as pb is a `` strong - coupling '' superconductor .",
    "using the model of disordered array as the background and the extrapolated values of the critical current at @xmath86 , we show that an estimate of the number of junctions in the film can be made .",
    "the estimate shows that not all grain boundaries may be acting as junctions / weak - links .",
    "it also supports the possibility that the first layer of atoms that stick to the substrate may have a significantly different structure  @xcite than the subsequent upper layers .",
    "in such cases a slightly more uniform lower layer may offset the phase - breaking effect of a considerable number of grain - boundaries .",
    "+ if superconducting behaviour of each grain follows approximately the bcs model , then we should have the zero temperature gap .",
    "such an assumption is certainly valid in the vicinity of @xmath6 , deviations from this being important only at lower temperatures , as discussed above .",
    "the average critical current of each junction is @xmath89 , where @xmath2 and @xmath6 are experimentally measured .",
    "the number of junctions acting in parallel should then be given by @xmath90 the total number of junctions ( over 1mm@xmath291 mm ) is then approximately @xmath31 . using the critical current data shown and their @xmath6 we find the following for the bi films :     @xmath91(@xmath5 ) & @xmath30 & @xmath92 + # 36 & 53@xmath12bi & 4.32 & 421 & 942 & 953 + # 25 & 65@xmath12bi / ge & 4.5 & 236 & 651 & 954 + & 65@xmath93bi & 4.29 & 252 & 730 & 955 + # 35&85@xmath93bi / ge & 5.23 & 135 & 473 & 954",
    "+    we find that there are @xmath4 10@xmath94 junctions / mm@xmath95 in a @xmath760@xmath12 film .",
    "as expected the number of junctions reduce when the film thickness is increased .",
    "this is expected as many of the gaps / voids between grains may be filling up as more material is deposited , reducing the number of junctions .",
    "based on this we obtain the following values for @xmath96 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the 85@xmath12 film at @xmath97=0 : + @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath2/bond = @xmath100 , @xmath101farad , + which are reasonable values .    we find that at low temperatures @xmath2 tends to a constant value and so does @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath27 and hence @xmath14 also varies very little at low temperatures , which is to be expected .",
    "near @xmath6 the behaviour is dominated by the variation of the critical current of the bond .",
    "the value of the capacitance and resistance ( normal state ) do not vary much with temperature .",
    "we also find that for this value of thickness , the film is in a regime where charging energy/``coulomb blockade '' is negligible compared to the josephson - coupling energy at low temperatures .",
    "the value of capacitance will however reduce drastically if the thickness of the film is lesser .",
    "in fact a recent optical frequency measurement  @xcite of the intergrain capacitance , in much thinner pb films , reported a value of @xmath4 @xmath103 farad , which can be compared with the values we have inferred above . in such cases single electron tunneling effects may be expected to play a very important role in transport processes .",
    "it is interesting to compare the values we have estimated with typical values of `` fabricated '' regular josephson - junction arrays . from the published literature we pick one work  @xcite we have already cited earlier .",
    "we find that the arrays used had a typical junction capacitance of 1 - 3@xmath2910@xmath104farad , junction area of @xmath4 1@xmath105m@xmath95 , junction resistance of 4 - 150k@xmath5 .",
    "these values , particularly those of junction - capacitance and `` unit cell''-area that we have estimated , are of the same order .",
    "however the value of josephson coupling energy ( and hence @xmath2/bond ) reported by them are much less , compared to deposited films .",
    "thus the screening effects of the supercurrents flowing in the films may be expected to be much greater than in fabricated arrays .",
    "the current density would surely have a lot of spatial variation- if however we deliberately neglect this aspect and calculate a supercurrent density a film ( taking the nominal thickness to be the average thickness ) can support before going normal , for the 85@xmath93 film we get a number @xmath4 10@xmath106amp / cm@xmath95 , which can be compared with typical values reported for disordered films of the copper oxide superconductors .      in an ordered array of josephson junctions , at finite temperatures",
    "vortex - antivortex pairs are generated spontaneously .",
    "these vortices may be visualized as a circulating pattern of the  phase - variable \" in neighbouring islands , several characteristics of these vortices have been studied in superfluids and arrays .",
    "one of the atomic scale disordered systems that has been studied with respect to the k - t transition is the quenched hg - xe mixture  @xcite . in this section",
    "we investigate whether some of the observed characteristics of the i - v curves of disordered sn and bi films can be attributed to a kosterlitz - thouless type transition .",
    "[ bi_kt_40a ] shows a set of i - v curves taken at various temperatures .",
    "all the curves show a clear critical current and retrapping current- and a transition to the normal state resistance of 1210@xmath5 and 942@xmath5 for this particular film . for a few temperatures just below @xmath6 ,",
    "the `` superconducting state '' shows dissipation .",
    "the resistance remains constant over 3 - 4 decades of current and hence there is no self heating effect .",
    "it is tempting to identify the appearance of a ohmic dissipative state with the unbinding of vortices - the `` kosterlitz - thouless '' transition .",
    "however we need to be cautious with such an identification .",
    "one of the signatures of k - t transition is that , below @xmath108 there is a regime where the voltage increases as the cube of the current .",
    "the reason for this is that below @xmath108 all the free vortices are generated by the current itself .",
    "the current exerts oppositely directed `` lorentz force '' on the vortex and the antivortex - and hence tends to create free vortices by breaking the pairs .",
    "the number of vortices just below @xmath108 increases as @xmath109 and hence the voltage rises approximately as @xmath110 .",
    "even though we may see such linear regions in a log plot , we do not always find this predicted cubic dependence in that region of temperature .",
    "experiments on proximity coupled arrays  @xcite have shown both - the linear regime in a log plot and cubic dependence of voltage on current . in our case",
    "we find that the 70@xmath12 bi film data shows this feature - see fig .",
    "[ bi_kt_70a ] ( upper panel ) , whereas for many other thicknesses the _ i - v _ curves below the possible @xmath108 do not have any region where a @xmath111 dependence is obvious .",
    "any such behaviour should have shown up clearly in a log - log plot .",
    "the 70@xmath12 film also shows another characteristic signature of @xmath112 transition ( lower panel ) . above @xmath108",

    "the `` best fit '' is shown in fig .",
    "[ bi_kt_70a ] .",
    "we have a mean - field @xmath6 = 3.55k and @xmath108 = 3.01k for this film . with increasing thickness , the resistive transition becomes steeper and the range of temperature over which the k - t type behaviour may be seen , also narrows down .",
    "for a 100@xmath93 bi film ( @xmath28 = 106@xmath5 , data not shown ) we found that the region narrows down to less than 100mk .",
    "this is to be expected since the thicker films approach 3-d behaviour and the k - t transition is restricted to 2-d systems .",
    "an important aspect that remains unaddressed is the robustness of the k - t transition to disorder .",
    "however , since vortices are macroscopic objects , which average over large areas of the films - compared to microscopic atomic scale disorder , the k - t transition may be expected to remain quite robust in presence of disorder .",
    "we have shown that several properties of quench condensed films of sn and bi can be understood by visualizing them as strongly disordered arrays of josephson junctions .",
    "superconductor - insulator transition in such arrays are well known and predicted to occur around @xmath114  @xcite . refering to eq .",
    "[ jjeq ] we can see that it should occur in the vicinity of @xmath115 but not necessarily exactly at @xmath116 .",
    "a simple power - law behaviour of the critical current of these films ( with @xmath117 500@xmath5 ) is found , and the observed i - v characteristics indicate a possible vortex - unbinding transition in these films .",
    "the picture of josephson coupling between superconducting patches in the film , implies that there is a strong variation of carrier density in the film itself .",
    "this bears a strong resemblance to the percolation type description of 2-deg  @xcite that has been successfully used to describe some aspects of the observed metal - insulator transition in si - mosfets . to some extent",
    "computer simulations can reproduce the behaviour of the actual films .",
    "the difficulties in doing numerical work on strongly disordered systems are well known .",

    "<S> we have investigated the i - v characteristics of strongly disordered ultra - thin films of _ bi _ and _ sn _ produced by quench - condensation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that both these sytems can be visualized as strongly disordered arrays of josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed i - v characteristics of these films is hysteretic , when the injected current is ramped from zero to critical current and back . </S>",
    "<S> these are remarkably similar to the hysteretic i - v of an underdamped single junction . </S>",
    "<S> we show by computer simulations that hysteresis can persist in a very strongly disordered array . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to estimate the individual junction parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) from the experimental i - vs of the film using this model . </S>",
    "<S> the films studied are in a regime where the josephson - coupling energy is larger than the charging energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a simple relation @xmath3 describes the temperature dependence of the critical current quite accurately for films with sheet resistance @xmath4 500@xmath5 or lower . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence of a vortex - unbinding transition in the i - vs taken at temperatures slightly below the mean - field @xmath6 . </S>"
