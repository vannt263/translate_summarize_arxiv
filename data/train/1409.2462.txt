    "any model of galactic or cosmic chemical evolution will depend on an assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and a potentially measurable star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "in fact , only the convolution of the two is measurable through the observed luminosity density .",
    "nevertheless , dramatic improvements have been made in our understanding of the star formation history , particularly at high redshift .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite using the canada - france redshift survey started the path towards obtaining the comoving luminosity density at redshifts up to @xmath2 , quickly followed by numerous studies which showed an intense period of star formation between redshifts @xmath3 @xcite and up to @xmath4 @xcite which showed some evidence for a downturn in the inferred sfr .",
    "a large body of measurements of the luminosity density spanning redshifts up to @xmath5 was compiled by @xcite and updated in @xcite .",
    "these results point to a sharply rising sfr at low redshifts which peaks at around @xmath6 and falls off at large redshifts .",
    "the redshift range was extended in a series of papers @xcite which now include data out to a remarkable @xmath7 .",
    "the inferred fall off of the sfr , @xmath8 , at @xmath9 appears to be quite steep , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite had used the infrared ( ir ) galaxy counts to deduce the corresponding cosmic star formation history .",
    "their study presents measurements of the ir luminosity function and they concluded that a sub - population of colder galaxies exists .",
    "recently , @xcite have reviewed in great detail the cosmic star formation history and specifically discuss different complementary techniques which allow one to map the history of cosmic star formation .",
    "particularly important is the correction due to dust attenuation of the far - uv luminosity density in order to be able to convert it to a sfr .",
    "one way of estimating the attenuation factor is a comparison of the uncorrected inferred far - uv and far - ir sfrs @xcite .",
    "this remains as one of the chief uncertainties in establishing the sfr at high redshift .",
    "another issue is the contribution of emission lines to the apparent cosmic sfr density ( csfrd ) . however",
    "a general conclusion from the optical / uv / ir data is that the stellar mass density inferred from the csfrd matches that observed over the entire observed redshift range @xcite .    recently , in an attempt to reduce systematic uncertainties induced due to the unknown stellar mass - to - halo mass relation , markov chain monte carlo methods were employed on the large extant database up to @xmath11 @xcite . while there is certainly qualitative agreement ( when normalized to the same imf ) with the earlier work of @xcite , the new sfr of @xcite peaks at slightly lower redshift .",
    "it is well known that there may be significant uncertainties in extracting the sfr from the luminosity function at large redshift . as noted above",
    ", this may be due to dust obscuration , but also more importantly , due to the fact that in any scenario of hierarchical structure formation , early star formation takes place in very faint galaxies ( or proto - galaxies ) and may be missed in existing surveys which are magnitude - limited .",
    "indeed it has been argued @xcite that integrating the luminosity function down to @xmath12 ( significantly below the lowest measured value of @xmath13 ) would lead to a significant increase in the sfr at redshifts @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , downsizing , which is both observed , ( e.g. @xcite ) , and theoretically interpreted via the impact of feedback models on gas consumption @xcite , further complicates matters .",
    "an alternative to searching for star formation in low luminosity galaxies is possible if we can connect the rate of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at high redshift to the sfr @xcite .",
    "recent attempts at making such a connection @xcite have all indicated a higher sfr at high @xmath15 relative to methods using luminosity functions . using grbs to trace the sfr",
    ", one would infer a much slower fall - off as a function of redshift , @xmath16 @xcite for @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the relation between the sfr and the grb rates is very uncertain and the method to derive the sfr redshift evolution from grbs includes numerous assumptions and still largely unknown biases ( vergani , private communication , see also @xcite )",
    ". however , this is still a promising method and we will use these results as illustrative cases . noting the systematic uncertainty in connecting the rate of grbs with the sfr , attempts at modeling the relation have produced somewhat more moderate results for the sfr at high @xmath15 @xcite , still consistent with the lower bounds found in @xcite .",
    "the choice of sfr has direct consequences on the chemical and reionization history of the universe . a steeply falling sfr , as obtained from the luminosity density at high redshift ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , is likely to be insufficient for explaining the optical depth extracted from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite and an additional high redshift mode of star formation which can be associated with a top - heavy imf is one way of alleviating this problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , the early enrichment of the igm similarly points to an additional massive mode beyond that extracted from the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it has been argued that reionization @xcite and metal enrichment @xcite may better match observations if instead the sfr implied from the grb rate is used .",
    "this conclusion is especially apparent in the comparison of dla data @xcite and cluster data as compiled by @xcite , higher ionization states resulting however in smaller inferred metallicities .",
    "we note also that the specific sfr ( ssfr ) is in better agreement with that inferred from the cosmic star formation rate density over the redshift range from 0 to 8 @xcite , if the emission line - corrected values of @xcite are used .    here",
    ", we will explore the consequences of three choices for the sfr : 1 ) the sfr derived from the luminosity function of faint high redshift galaxies from @xcite supplemented with the high redshift observations of @xcite ; 2 ) the sfr implied by the swift grb rate from @xcite ; 3 ) an intermediate case where the sfr is scaled down by 0.3 dex , based on the models of @xcite .",
    "for the normal mode of star formation which extends to the present day , we will assume a salpeter imf .",
    "when appropriate , we will assume a high redshift mode of star formation which peaks at a redshift @xmath18 . while it is generally assumed that the initial mode of star formation is massive @xcite , it is possible that the high @xmath15 mode is dominated by intermediate mass stars @xcite .",
    "in all cases , we will work in the context of a hierarchical model for structure formation .",
    "this is coupled to a detailed model for cosmic chemical evolution @xcite , and allows us to keep track of the ionization history of the universe , track the abundances of many of the elements produced in massive and intermediate mass stars as a function of redshift , as well as track the rate of supernovae of type ii ( snii ) , the ssfr , and the stellar mass density .",
    "in the next section , we briefly describe the model of cosmic chemical evolution employed and our parameterization of the four choices of sfrs  based on the @xcite form for the sfr . for the case where an additional mode of star formation is required ,",
    "we optimize the choice of the sfr by scanning the parameter space and minimizing a @xmath19 likelihood function .",
    "we then compute the resulting ionization and chemical history of the universe for each of the sfrs considered . a priori , we assume only a normal mode of star formation which extends to the present day . when this is found to be insufficient ,",
    "we add a complementary high @xmath15 mode in order to achieve concordance for both the reionization and metal enrichment .",
    "the resulting chemical evolution and a comparison of the four sfrs is given in section 3 .",
    "a discussion of our results is given in section 4 .",
    "our work here is developed from a model of hierarchical structure formation based on the press - schechter formalism @xcite which determines the rate at which structures accrete mass .",
    "the model includes exchanges of baryonic mass between the gas within ( the ism ) and exterior to ( the igm ) structures .",
    "we assume a minimum mass for star - forming structures of @xmath20 .",
    "details of the model can be found in @xcite .    in all cases , we assume an imf with a single salpeter slope ( @xmath21 ) . the normal mode of star formation includes stellar masses between 0.1 m@xmath22 and 100 m@xmath22 . when this is supplemented with a high redshift mode , we assume a mass range of 36 m@xmath22 to 100 m@xmath22 for high mass stars . our sfr is always parameterized using the form given by @xcite @xmath23 the amplitude ( astration rate ) and the redshift of the sfr maximum are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 are related to its slope at low and high redshifts respectively .    to determine the ionization history , we take the evolution of the volume - filling fraction of ionized regions to be : = -_bn_bc(z ) q_ion^2(z)(1+z)^3|| where @xmath28 is the comoving density in baryons , @xmath29 the comoving density of ionizing photons , @xmath30 the recombination coefficient , and @xmath31 the clumping factor .",
    "this factor is taken from @xcite and varies from a value of 2 at @xmath32 to a constant value of 10 for @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is taken to be the standard form for a @xmath35cdm cosmology with a density of matter @xmath36 and a density of `` dark energy '' @xmath37 and taking @xmath38 .",
    "the escape fraction , @xmath39 , is set to 0.2 for each of our assumed modes of star formation .",
    "the number of ionizing photons for massive stars is calculated using the tables given in @xcite .",
    "finally , the thomson optical depth is computed as in @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath15 is the redshift of emission , and @xmath41 the thomson scattering cross - section . the latest result for the optical depth from the @xcite",
    "is based on the nine year @xcite polarization data and the two studies of optical depth are not substantially different .",
    "here we use the @xcite result of @xmath42 to compare with model predictions .    in what follows",
    "we consider four choices for the sfr .",
    "we begin with the sfr inferred from the grb rate @xcite which has the highest sfr at high @xmath15 of the models considered ( model 1 ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the normalization used to construct the sfr from the grb rate should not evolve beyond @xmath43 because most galaxies would have low enough metallicity that the grb rate saturates .",
    "in fact the specific mass accretion rate from simulations can be applied to compute the star formation rate by assuming the empirical ratio of stellar to halo mass obtained by normalizing to data at @xmath44 to successfully account for the observations to @xmath45 and then to predict the specific sfr ( ssfr - discussed below ) and sfr , to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to our second model below ( model 2 ) .",
    "the third model considered is based on the galaxy luminosity function @xcite ( model 3 ) .",
    "we will show , however , that this model marginally fails , for reasonable escape fractions , to give sufficient cmb optical depth , and develop a variant ( model 4 ) in which a complementary , high @xmath47 , mode of massive star formation is added to simultaneously account for enrichment and ionization .      keeping in mind the uncertainties in converting the grb rate to a global sfr , we begin by first considering the sfr obtained from the grb rate in @xcite .",
    "we have fit the sfr to the @xcite form and find @xmath48 m@xmath49/yr / mpc@xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the assumed sfr is shown in the upper left panel of fig .",

    "the red points providing the bulk of the data at low redshift are taken from @xcite .",

    "[ fig : k1]c , observational data ( black points ) come from @xcite .",

    "they combine these metallicity measurements with 195 from previous surveys , which were drawn from the sdss - dr3 and sdss - dr5 surveys for dla systems performed by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "moreover , we have added the nine mean points ( cyan points ) from @xcite ( see their figure 11 ) where horizontal error bars are determined such that there are equal numbers of data points per redshift bin .",
    "we note that at high redshift ( @xmath66 ) , models 1 and 2 ( red lines ) are a good fit to these mean z observations .",
    "this could support the idea that grbs could be better metal tracers ( and also sfr tracers ) at high z.    the grb rate - inferred cosmic star formation history is anti - biased with regard to the dark matter distribution according to @xcite , who argue that the implied preference for regions of high star formation accounts for the apparent enhancement in the corresponding star formation history .",
    "this conclusion is supported by our chemical evolution study : we obtain a slope that matches the data for the grb - inferred cosmic star formation history , and agrees in normalization if we reduce the effective yield by a factor @xmath67    in fig .",

    "@xcite argued that supernovae have been missed in optical surveys due to dust obscuration .",
    "the new higher rate at @xmath70 , is now in much better agreement with the types of models we are considering .",
    "both quantities ( the total metallicity and sn rate ) are sensitive to the assumed model of chemical evolution and can be used to discriminate between models and make reasonable parameter choices . like the optical depth ,",

    "a single mode of star formation is sufficient to explain these data .",
    "the above choice for the sfr can be considered as an upper limit .",
    "it was derived using a normalization of the grb rate to the sfr based on the @xcite sfr .",
    "any further flattening of the sfr at high redshift would produce a greater abundance of metals and lead to an excessive optical depth .",
    "adopting an alternate normalization based on the @xcite sfr leads to a lower sfr at high redshift by a factor of approximately 0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "one can obtain a more realistic sfr by assuming that two key time - scales are proportional with a fixed constant of proportionality : the inverse specific star formation and mass accretion rates .",
    "this assumption fits all data to @xmath71 and has predictive power to higher @xmath72 . by a small adjustment in the slope of the sfr at high redshift",

    "[ fig : b1 ] . as one can see by the solid blue curve in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : k1]b , using only a single mode of star formation in this case is not sufficient to account for the optical depth derived from cmb data .",
    "for this choice of the sfr , the optical depth only rises to @xmath83 at high redshift , more than 2 @xmath63 below the cmb value .",
    "furthermore , the redshift of reionization is significantly below the wmap value .",
    "for this case , we find @xmath84 and is over 4 @xmath63 too low . nevertheless , the overall metallicity and type ii supernova rate are quite consistent with observations as seen by the solid blue curves in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : k1]c , d. thus in this case , we are led to consider a high mass mode of star formation operating predominantly at high redshift , to fit the optical depth .    for the high mass mode , we assume an imf with a salpeter slope ( as we have done for all other imfs ) but with a restricted mass range from 36  100 m@xmath22 .",
    "although we also use the @xcite form for the sfr , there is now , in principle , considerable freedom for the selection of the four sfr parameters . to help in this choice we performed a scan of the 4d parameter space to minimize a @xmath19 function which is described below .",

    "[ fig : no ] , we show the analogous evolution of nitrogen and oxygen as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the nitrogen abundances are very similar for all four models considered .",
    "they all slightly underproduce [ n / h ] .",
    "note however , that our predictions are closer to the measurements in damped lyman-@xmath64 systems ( @xcite for which [ n / o ]  @xmath112  @xmath113 for [ o / h ] in the range between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "nitrogen has different nucleosynthetic origins ( compared to oxygen for example ) , including one from a potential intermediate mass stellar mode which is not considered here .",
    "consequently , our calculation provides only a lower limit to the production of nitrogen .",
    "to have an idea of how much additional n production is necessary to match the data , we have multiplied the n yield by a factor of 4 and show the result for model 4 by the dotted blue curve . in contrast to c and o , n is not produced in massive stars , so model 4 does not show a bump at low metallicity .    the oxygen abundances for models 1 , 2 , and 3 all look similar , however , the evolution of [ o / h ] is significantly different for model 4 .",
    "here we see directly the impact of the high mass mode which shows a local peak in [ o / h ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath115 .",
    "this is the only model that can explain the abundances seen in very low metallicity stars ( magenta points ) , as is the case for carbon as well . due to uncertainties concerning the oxygen synthesis in massive stars",
    ", we show the [ o / h ] abundance for model 4 using an o yield enhancement of a factor of 2 ( shown by the dotted blue curve ) .",
    "the result for the other models would scale similarly and provide a better fit to the data at [ fe / h ] @xmath110 .",
    "as in the case for oxygen , the evolution of magnesium shows the impact of the high mass mode in model 4 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mg ] ( left ) where the evolution of [ mg / h ] is shown as a function of the iron abundance .",
    "while models 1,2 and 3 all fit the data nicely , model 4 appears to overproduce mg at [ fe / h ] @xmath116 .",
    "once again , for comparison , we have plotted ( dotted blue line ) the mg evolution multiplying the mg yield by a factor 2 .",
    "a recent study @xcite devoted to nucleosynthesis in massive stars at zero metallicity presents new mg yields .",
    "there , it was found that no mg is produced for massive stars larger than 30 m@xmath22 in the most of the models considered at zero metallicity .",
    "we have included these new yields at very low metallicity ( z@xmath117 0.0001 z@xmath22 ) which should result in the lowest possible mg production .",
    "the right panel presents the mg evolution for model 4 ( which includes a massive mode at high redshift ) with these two different yields : from @xcite ( solid line ) and from @xcite ( dotted line ) .",
    "this choice of yields for the early production of mg provides us with a lower limit to mg / h and fits the lower envelope of data .",
    "a signature of a high mass mode which corresponds to a distinct population of stars ( pop iii ) is clearly of great importance in understanding the chemical evolutionary history of the universe . @xcite",
    "defined a transition discriminant , , based on the carbon and oxygen abundances at low metallicity , and recently @xcite have provided an updated formula for : @xmath118}+0.9\\times10^{\\rm [ o / h]})\\ , , \\ ] ] which we use here .",
    "when sufficiently abundant , ionized carbon and neutral atomic oxygen act as a trigger to lower mass star formation and signify the transition to pop i / ii star formation @xcite .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of this quantity in the context of chemical evolution with hierarchical structure formation , see @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtrans ] , we show the evolution of @xmath119 as a function of [ fe / h ] for the four models .",
    "all models make similar predictions for [ fe / h ] @xmath120 .",
    "only model 4 can explain the 2 observations with relatively high at [ fe / h ] @xmath121 , while none of the models can account for the scattering of points with @xmath122 and @xmath123 [ fe / h ] @xmath124 .",
    "as noted earlier , we do not consider here the effects of an intermediate mass mode which would be a large contributor of carbon at low metallicity .",
    "these points correspond precisely to the high c content in cemp stars .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr ] ( left ) shows the evolution of the mean specific star formation ( ssfr ) as a function of redshift for the four considered models .",
    "the ssfr is calculated by dividing the cosmic sfr density by the mean stellar mass density ( shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr ] ) .",
    "we have taken the compilation of data from @xcite and added a point from @xcite at @xmath125 .",
    "the estimated stellar mass range is @xmath126 to @xmath127 m@xmath22 .",
    "there no significant difference between the models . at high redshift",
    ", they fit the data points .    as usual , at low redshift , the ssfr calculation is too steep relative to data , possibly due to an overestimate of the stellar mass .",
    "the model rise from the present epoch to the @xmath128 star formation rate peak is shallower than found in the data .",
    "it is likely that this is due to hidden star formation in dense molecular gas and the galaxy merger contribution , not included in our simple modeling and reflected in the strong difference between the star formation rate contributions by normal star - forming galaxies ( relatively shallow and with low ssfr ) and luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) ( very steep and high ssfr ) as found by @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows the evolution of the mean stellar mass density as a function of redshift .",
    "the data points are taken from the compilation by @xcite , once again adding the @xmath125 point from @xcite .",
    "models 3 and 4 fit the observational data at high redshift . indeed",
    ", these results clearly show the limitation of this approach at low redshift .",
    "this is related to feedback processes that prevent stars from forming and enhancing the ssfr .",
    "models 1 and 2 can not fit this data because these latter observations are deduced from the sfr data from observations of star - forming galaxies . while grbs are associated with dwarf galaxies , however even just considering the data based on the grb rate , additional dwarf galaxies are still required that are well below the observational limits . possibly these might be associated with grbs that have no apparent host galaxy .",
    "the dla abundances reflect enhanced star formation rates at high redshift as does the intercluster medium at low redshift .",
    "the fact that these data are consistent over a wide redshift range argues against a systematic change in the imf , but favors a dwarf galaxy population that has a steep luminosity function and hosts the grbs .",
    "evidence for a steep luminosity function comes both locally from dwarf galaxy surveys in clusters , where harassment is thought to be responsible , and at high redshift where studies of the stellar mass function show that the faint - end slope , @xmath64 , steepens from @xmath129 to @xmath130 over @xmath131 @xcite , the explanation in this case presumably being due to the expected convergence to the halo mass function .",
    "the steep value of @xmath64 has been found via a lensed sample of high redshift ( @xmath132 ) galaxies to extend to below @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "wmap and planck data @xcite have given us unprecedented precision in determining cosmological observables . among these are the integrated optical depth and the corresponding epoch of reionization at @xmath106 .",
    "we therefore know that some stellar activity and hence chemical evolution must have taken place at a still higher redshift ( assuming that stellar light is the source of reionization ) . the discovery of lyman break galaxies at @xmath134 @xcite opened the door to a host of rest frame uv observations of galaxies at ever increasing redshift .",
    "there are now six candidate galaxies at @xmath135 @xcite , and between 200 - 500 galaxies at redshift @xmath136 @xcite allowing one to map out the global uv luminosity function and gain insight into the global sfr density .",
    "however because observations at @xmath137 and above remain sparse , significant uncertainties remain in the sfr at high redshift .",
    "to some extent , the sfr determined from the galaxy luminosity function can be thought of as setting a lower limit as systematic effects due to dust obscuration would tend to increase the derived sfr .",
    "there is also the problem that such surveys are flux - limited and hence biased by the brightest galaxies , and again the true sfr might be higher , particularly at high redshift @xcite . indeed , as we have shown above ( in our discussion of model 3 ) , the sfr derived from these flux - limited surveys is not sufficient to reionize the universe at sufficiently high redshift .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite .    while the true sfr may be somewhat higher at large @xmath15 than that derived by the uv galaxy luminosity function , it is also possible that there was a burst of star formation at @xmath106 that was primarily responsible for the reionization of the universe .",
    "here we have considered in model 4 , the effect of such a burst on the chemical history of the universe .    on the other hand ,",
    "grbs are expected to be visible out to very high redshifts of @xmath138 @xcite , the current record being @xmath139 @xcite . as the origin of grbs",
    "is expected to be core collapse supernovae @xcite , it is sensible to infer that these events may trace the sfr as many authors have assumed . however , as discussed above , a straight fit to the sfr derived from existing grb data would lead to an optical depth in excess of that determined from cmb data .",
    "extracting the sfr from grb is also not free from its own set of uncertainties and biases @xcite .",
    "models attempting to overcome these problems predict a steeper fall off at high redshift @xcite and these  softened \" sfrs yield predictions for the optical depth and reionization which are quite consistent with data as we have shown in model 2 .    presently , most observations of chemical abundances are available only at relatively low redshift . for redshifts",
    "@xmath140 , we would require observations of objects with iron abundances [ fe / h ] @xmath141 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fe ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the hierarchical picture of structure formation which is at the core of our cosmic chemical evolution models , element abundances are primarily sensitive to the late - time sfr where the models are constrained by the low @xmath15 determination of the sfr . as a consequence , in most cases",
    ", the models considered predict very similar abundances for [ fe / h ] @xmath120 .",
    "differences begin to occur at lower metallicity , and these are most apparent for model 4 where a high mass mode of star formation is included at high redshift .",
    "most notably this model predicts enhanced abundances of c , o , and mg at very low metallicity as is seen in some of the most primitive stars in our own galaxy .",
    "it is clear that enhancement of the sfr occurs relative to that inferred from the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this may be because faint but star - forming galaxies have been missed ( as must be supposed if the grb data is a better indicator of the true sfr ) , or because pop iii star formation included at high redshift results in an exclusively high mass ( and short - lived ) mode of star formation . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the sfrs in all models are similar ( as there is far less uncertainty ) and chemical abundances are far less discriminating . to better disentangle the sfr at high redshift",
    ", new abundance data is required at very low metallicity .",
