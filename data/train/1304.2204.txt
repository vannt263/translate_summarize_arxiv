    "hence we work in the `` thin '' category of digraphs , in which there is at most one generic morphism from one digraph to another .",
    "some significant constructions in graph theory turn out to be functors , and sometimes some of their fundamental properties are related to the fact that they have a left adjoint , a right adjoint , and sometimes both .",
