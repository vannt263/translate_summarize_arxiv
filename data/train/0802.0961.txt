    "a number of physical processes affect the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "star formation is among the most important processes , not only because it largely determines the bulk properties of a galaxy , but also because the history of star - formation essentially reflects the formation history of a galaxy .",
    "numerical simulation is a powerful tool to study galaxy formation . to compare `` simulated '' galaxies with observed ones ,",
    "it is necessary to follow the dynamics of baryonic matter as well as the assembly of dark matter halos .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation are , however , often hampered by the fact that relevant physics are still poorly understood . numerical resolution is another limiting factor . in particular , appropriate physical models of star formation should be used in high resolution simulations .",
    "for example , recent simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , have a spatial resolution of several hundreds pc , with the corresponding mass resolution of @xmath11 . in such simulations ,",
    "simple models such as an isothermal interstellar medium ( ism ) are applied to galactic gas disks .",
    "in addition , individual giant molecular clouds ( hereafter gmcs ) in galaxies are not resolved in current simulations , although gmcs are regarded as the site of star formation .",
    "thus one often needs to use phenomenological models , to describe the star formation processes , which is called subgrid physics .",
    "there are many prescriptions ( `` subgrid models '' ) of star formation used in simulations of galaxy formation with coarse resolutions .",
    "a commonly used technique is to convert high - density gas elements to collisionless `` star '' particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "typical criteria to spawn star particles are as follows ( e.g. , @xcite ) : ( 1 )  the physical density is greater than @xmath12 , ( 2 )  the temperature is lower than @xmath13 , and ( 3 )  the velocity field is converging . if these three conditions are satisfied , ` stars ' are then formed at a rate following the local schmidt law .",
    "namely , the local star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath14 , is assumed to be proportional to the local gas density , @xmath15 , and inversely proportional to the local dynamical time , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dimensionless star formation efficiency parameter .",
    "the value of this parameter is usually calibrated by the global star formation properties , the schmidt - kennicutt relation @xcite . choosing @xmath19 reproduces the schmidt - kennicutt relation in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the threshold density is too low which does not correspond to typical densities of the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath20 ) gas in real galaxies .",
    "there are several models that assumes higher density regions as star forming regions .",
    "for instance , @xcite adopted @xmath21 as the star forming regions in a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation .",
    "when he chose a plausible star formation time , @xmath22 : @xmath23 , which is set to constant ( @xmath24 ) in his simulation , the schmidt - kennicutt relation is also reproduced .",
    "more recently , ( ) performed adaptive mesh refinement simulations of the ism in a static halo potential .",
    "their simulations resolve individual star forming regions ( the minimum cell sizes are @xmath25 ) .",
    "they compared two variants of star formation criteria : ( a )  @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , and ( b )  @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "both models also employ converging flows as one of the star formation criteria and the star formation law described by equation ( [ eq : sf ] ) .",
    "interestingly , it is found that both the models reproduce the schmidt - kennicutt relation .",
    "the star formation histories are also found to be similar .",
    "therefore , their results appear to imply that the global star formation properties are not sensitive to the details of star formation prescriptions .    in this paper , we examine how numerical prescriptions of star formation affect structure of the ism , and the global star formation history ( sfh ) of a galactic disk .",
    "in particular , we focus on the threshold density in star formation criteria ( @xmath5 ) and the star formation efficiency ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we adopt two values of density threshold : @xmath12 ( low-@xmath5 model ) and @xmath32 ( high-@xmath5 model ) .",
    "we also test the effect of star formation efficiency parameter @xmath1 in high-@xmath5 models .",
    "we perform high - resolution sph simulations ( number of sph particles are @xmath33 ) in a galactic potential and we compare structure of the ism and stellar disks .",
    "we show that , while both models can exhibit similar sfhs and the relation of surface gas density to surface sfr , only high-@xmath5 models have the complex , inhomogeneous , and multiphase ism .",
    "the ism has a log - normal like probability density distribution ( pdf ) , while a model that does not include either star formation and supernova ( sn ) feedback has a power - law like pdf ; star formation and sn feedback distort pdf .",
    "interestingly , structure of the ism , stellar disks , and sfrs ( sfhs ) are not simply proportional to @xmath1 in high-@xmath5 models .",
    "this is because the mass supply timescale from from the reservoir ( @xmath9 ) to the star forming regions ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 and this timescale is not affected by the adopted value of @xmath1 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we mention the relation between numerical resolution and expressible phase of the ism in section 2 . in section 3 , we describe properties of a model galaxy and our numerical methods .",
    "our results are presented in section 4 .",
    "summary and discussions are given in section 5 .",
    "we consider regions with the density greater than @xmath32 as `` star forming regions '' . from the jeans condition",
    ", we can estimate the resolution necessary to express the gravitational collapse for a fluid with a given density and temperature .",
    "in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , this condition is expressed as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the jeans mass , @xmath38 is a typical number of neighbor particles , and @xmath39 is the mass of an sph particle @xcite .",
    "the jeans condition then determines resolved regions in phase ( @xmath40 ) plane .",
    "figure [ fig : jeans]a shows the limits for several different particle masses .",
    "we can accurately treat the gravitational fragmentation of fluid in the upper region of each line in the phase diagram .",
    "the line is given in equation ( 3 ) in @xcite .",
    "the curve indicates the thermal balance between the cooling and heating that are both adopted in this paper ( see  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that a very higher resolution is required in order to resolve the gravitational collapse to dense clouds , e.g. , gmcs .",
    "figure [ fig : jeans]b illustrates @xmath37 and @xmath39 for a given critical density , @xmath42 , where @xmath42 is defined as values of the density @xmath42 at intersection between equilibrium @xmath40 relation in figure [ fig : jeans]a and constant @xmath37 line .",
    "the solid curve indicates @xmath37 as a function of @xmath42 , while the dashed curve represents @xmath39 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the red region overplotted on the dashed curve represents @xmath42 of simulations in this paper , where the mass range of sph particles in simulations is on the order of @xmath43 ( see table [ tab : runs ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "we choose several simulations of galaxy formation ( @xmath44 in @xcite ; @xmath45 in @xcite ) and plot the corresponding range of the critical density as the blue region .",
    "we investigate 3-d evolution of a gas disk in a static disk - halo potential . we assume a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile @xcite for a dark matter halo , and a miyamoto - nagai model @xcite for a stellar disk . for the halo model",
    ", we adopt a cosmological model of a standard @xmath46 cdm universe @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we use these parameters to model the dark matter halo . by adopting the static potentials for a dark matter halo and a stellar disk",
    ", we can prevent global disk instabilities and artificial disk heating due to the scattering of gas and star particles by massive dark matter particles , which are inevitable if we use a live halo with low mass resolution .",
    "we will study the effect of live halo and also the effect of the mass resolution of halo particles in forthcoming papers .",

    "is based on that of @xcite .",
    "we use an opening angle @xmath50 for a cell opening criterion .",
    "we only use a monopole moment .",

    "we do not include heating from an ultra - violet ( uv ) background radiation .",
    "this is because we consider the structure of the ism in the current environment of the milkyway galaxy in this paper .",
    "when we consider the detailed structure of the ism in the galaxy formation process , a careful treatment of the uv background and the local fuv radiations is required since the fluxes are quite stronger than those in the local universe in high redshift universe .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
