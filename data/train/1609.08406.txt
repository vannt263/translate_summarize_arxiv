    "anderson localization in homogeneous disordered materials is traditionally signaled by exponential suppression of diffusion and conductance  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the two is firmly established by linear - response theory and the einstein - sutherland relation  @xcite .",
    "hence , the decay of localized wave packets and transmission coefficients with distance are characterized by the same localization length .",
    "bias fields , such as electric forces , induce strong nonlinear response , which significantly affect localization and question this relation . for a weak bias field ,",
    "algebraic ( rather than exponential ) localization of the wave - functions has been established by previous numerical  @xcite and analytical  @xcite work . furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite presented a rigorous proof that states become extended beyond a critical value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the force , @xmath2 the particle mass , and @xmath3 the disorder strength ) , see also ref .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with a diagrammatic calculation of the asymptotic density of an expanding wave packet  @xcite , yielding @xmath4 in the direction of the force , with @xmath5 for @xmath6 . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the asymptotic density is not normalizable , hence signaling a delocalization transition at @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , numerical evidence was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transmission coefficient remains algebraic for arbitrary large values of the force , @xmath9 , and is thus unaffected by the delocalization transition .",
    "moreover the exponent @xmath10 found numerically significantly differs from the exponent @xmath11 .",
    "while striking , it is worth noting that this result was found for the specific kronig - penney lattice model and by averaging the logarithm of the transmission rather than the transmission itself .",
    "therefore the behavior of physical quantities that are directly related to the transmission , such as the landauer conductance , remains unclear , in particular for generic models of disorder .",
    "this question has direct applications in mesoscopic physics to understand the electric response to a bias field in disordered carbon nanotubes  @xcite or silicon nanowires  @xcite for instance .",
    "it may have even greater relevance to ultracold atoms where anderson localization has been extensively studied  @xcite . in those systems , a tunable bias field can easily be applied , and the conductance is now accessible via the discharge between well - controlled reservoirs  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the transmission of a one - dimensional disordered matter wave guide subjected to arbitrary disorder and bias force field .",
    "for white - noise disorder and a constant force , we find algebraic decay of the transmission coefficient for arbitrary force strength and derive the exponent @xmath12 analytically , hence generalizing the result of ref .",

    "we also perform numerical calculations for various models , and obtain excellent agreement with analytical calculations .",

    "to compute the statistical distribution of the transmission coefficient , we use the transfer matrix approach .",
    "we briefly outline its generalization to include a , possibly inhomogeneous , bias force field ( see details in the supplemental material ) . assuming that the ( non - averaged ) transmission , @xmath26 , and reflection , @xmath27 , coefficients from the origin to the distance @xmath28 are known , we add an infinitesimal cell of material of length @xmath29 , with transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . the transmission coefficient at length @xmath32 is then computed from the product of the two transfer matrices .",

    "since @xmath38 , the non - vanishing value of the reflection coefficient @xmath31 results from typically less that one scattering and it may thus be computed in the single - scattering approximation .",

    "we thus find the fokker - planck equation @xmath44 with the initial condition @xmath45 .",
    "note that , for a positive bias force field @xmath1 and a bounded disorder power spectrum @xmath46 , the back - scattering mean free path @xmath36 increases and the wave length @xmath47 decreases with the distance @xmath28 , so that all the validity conditions of eq .",

    "the resulting differential equation for @xmath50 admits the analytic solution  @xcite @xmath51 which generalizes the celebrated log - normal law .",
    "the main result of this approach is that the solution  ( [ eq : distrabrikosov ] ) is universal .",

    "( [ eq : metrics ] ) .",
    "we now compute characteristic quantities and compare them to exact numerical calculations .",
    "let us start with the logarithm of the transmission .",
    "we find @xmath52 , which calls for several remarks .",
    "first , this formula exactly matches the heuristic formula proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to interpret numerical results found for the specific kronig - penney model .",
    "our analysis justifies this formula on rigorous grounds and generalizes it to any model of disorder and bias field .",
    "second , for white - noise disorder and constant force , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we find @xmath55 where @xmath0 is the relative strength of the force and the disorder  @xcite .",
    "it yields the characteristic algebraic decay @xmath56 .",
    "excellent agreement with exact numerical calculations is found for continuous white - noise disorder [ see the open blue squares and dotted - dashed line on fig .  [",
    "fig : graph_universality](a ) ] .",
    "third , the relative fluctuations of the logarithmic transmission equal @xmath57 at small @xmath58 and decrease as @xmath59 for large values of @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the quantity @xmath60 is self - averaging for white - noise disorder and constant force since the rescaled length @xmath58 then diverges in the long - distance limit .",
    "we now turn to the average transmission , which is more directly related to physically - relevant quantities ( see below ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : distrabrikosov ] ) , we find the exact formula @xmath61 again , it is in excellent agreement with exact numerical calculations [ see filled blue squares and solid line on fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_universality](a ) ] . note that the relative fluctuations of @xmath62 rapidly increase for large @xmath58 , @xmath63 , so that the numerical calculation of @xmath64 requires a huge number of realizations of the disorder .",
    "for white - noise disorder and constant force , we find the asymptotic behavior @xmath65 , up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "the difference of the scalings @xmath66 and @xmath65 is not surprising .",
    "it is reminiscent of the large fluctuations associated to the log - normal law as well known in the absence of a bias field  @xcite .    in turn",
    ", it is quite surprising that the scaling @xmath65 differs from that found for the density profile of an expanding wave packet , @xmath67  @xcite . to understand this difference ,",
    "consider a particle initially at position @xmath68 and look at the probability that it has been transmitted beyond @xmath69 after infinite time .",
    "if the disorder is restricted to the space interval @xmath70 $ ] , this probability is given by the transmission coefficient @xmath71 and therefore decays as @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , if the disorder extends over the full @xmath28 line , it turns into @xmath73 , which decays as @xmath74 .",
    "this slower decay may be ascribed to the presence of long - range algebraically - localized eigenstates , centered beyond @xmath69 , whose overlap with the initial wavefunction is significant , thus enhancing the probability of finding the particle at @xmath75 .",
    "note that this effect is expected to be less important when the eigenstates are more strongly localized , i.e.  when @xmath76 vanishes .",
    "this is consistent with the equality of the two exponents , @xmath77 in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "the statistical distribution of transmission determines a number of physical quantities , and in the first place landauer conductance  @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined as the ratio of the current @xmath79 induced by the potential imbalance between two charge reservoirs to their potential difference @xmath80 , at zero temperature . in the limit @xmath81",
    ", the disorder - average conductance reads @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath83 are the chemical potentials of the reservoirs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reservoirs_deltav ] ) , @xmath50 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distrabrikosov ] ) , and the function @xmath84 depends on the specific scheme  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the simplest case where @xmath80 is measured inside the reservoirs ( two - terminal scheme ) .",
    "one then finds the conductance @xmath85 with @xmath86 the conductance quantum .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 may be measured in mesoscopic  @xcite or ultracold - atom  @xcite systems for instance .",
    "extension to multi - terminal configurations is straightforward .    to discuss the behavior of @xmath88 , or equivalently @xmath62",
    ", it is worth including specific features beyond the ideal case considered so far , in particular disorder correlations . using the gaussian correlation function @xmath89 , where @xmath24 is the correlation length , we find that the algebraic decay is clearly visible at short distance but is strongly suppressed in large - distance limit  [ see numerics on fig .",
    "[ fig : graph_universality](b ) , magenta filled ( @xmath64 ) and open ( @xmath90 ) circles ] .",
    "this entails correlation - induced delocalization .",
    "this behavior is easily understood from that of the metrics @xmath58 , which now reads @xmath91}{2\\hbar^2(e+fx)},\\ ] ] where @xmath42={u_{\\textrm{\\tiny r}}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{e+fx}{\\hbar^2/4m{\\sigma_{\\textrm{\\tiny r}}}^2}\\right)$ ] .",
    "compared to white - noise disorder , here the linear increase of the kinetic energy @xmath54 , which appears in the argument of the power spectrum @xmath46 , suppresses the logarithmic divergence of @xmath58 . hence the metrics @xmath58 , the distribution @xmath50 , and all disorder - average functions of @xmath62 saturate when @xmath92 . this delocalization effect is not specific to gaussian correlations but applies to any model of disorder with finite - range correlations .",
    "similarly , faster - than - linear bias also entails delocalization since it makes @xmath58 converge .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical calculations performed with the slightly linearly increasing force @xmath93 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : graph_universality](b ) , brown diamonds ] .",
    "correlation - induced delocalization effects appear for @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and @xmath24 is the disorder correlation length . in the two - terminal configuration of fig .  [",
    "fig : reservoirs_deltav ] , @xmath96 is the fermi wavevector of the left - hand - side reservoir , with @xmath97 the fermi temperature and @xmath98 the boltzmann constant . using @xmath99",
    ", we find @xmath100 .",
    "for mesoscopic channels designed in ultracold - atom systems  @xcite , where typically @xmath101nk and @xmath102 m , and assuming that the force results from gravity on @xmath103li atoms , @xmath104n , we find @xmath105 m . since this value is of the order of magnitude of the channel length , correlation - induced delocalization effects can be significant in these systems . to circumvent this issue , one can take advantage of the universality of the distribution of transmission  ( [ eq : distrabrikosov ] ) .",
    "indeed , as shown on fig .",

    "[ fig : graph_universality](b ) . ] .",
    "let us finally consider the effect of a finite temperature , which is typically @xmath106 in ultracold - atom systems  @xcite . using the sommerfeld expansion of the current - potential characteristic function",

    "since the quantity @xmath114 is not a universal function of the rescaled length @xmath58 , such finite - temperature effects break universal scaling .",
    "however , if the system is sufficiently large so that @xmath115 , universal scaling is recovered .",
    "in conclusion , we have computed the statistical distribution of transmission in a disordered matter wave guide in the presence of a bias force . for white - noise disorder and a constant force ,",
    "we have shown that the transmission decays algebraically , irrespective of the value of the force , in agreement with numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "this behavior differs from the expansion of a wave packet , which features a delocalization transition  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "these different behaviors have been traced back to the long - range character of the algebraic decay of the localized eigenstates in the presence of the bias .",
    "they could be directly observed in ultracold - atom experiments , which allow for both transmission and expansion schemes  @xcite .",
    "while finite - range disorder correlations or non - constant forces may entail saturation of the transmission , we have shown that a universal behavior can be recovered using appropriate rescaling .",
