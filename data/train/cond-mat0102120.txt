    "traffic flow cellular automaton(ca ) models have attracted much interest recently . compared with other dynamical approaches , e.g. the fluid dynamical approach , to this class of problems , ca models are conceptually simpler and",
    "can be easily implemented on computers for numerical investigations [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "two popular one - dimensional ( 1d ) traffic flow models are the fukui - ishibashi(fi ) model [ 5 ] and the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) model [ 6 ] .",
    "an exact car - oriented mean - field ( comf ) theory has been developed for the fi model with arbitrary limit on the maximum speed @xmath1 , car density @xmath2 and delay probability @xmath3 [ 7,8 ] .",
    "however , for the ns model with high speed vehicles ( @xmath4 ) and stochastic delay , there is still no established exact analytical theory up to now [ 9,10 ] .",
    "the acceleration and stochastic delay rules of the ns model lead to complications in the time evolution of the flow and hence it is very difficult for exact analytical studies . in order to understand how these rules affect the evolution and the corresponding asymptotic state , we study a new 1d traffic flow ca model in which only the cars following the trail of the car ahead may be delayed .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows .",
    "the definition of the model and the evolution equations for the inter - car spacings are given in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iii some observations are made to describe the steady state of the system .",
    "we present the fundamental diagrams for the low car density case with arbitrary vehicle speed limit and the high density case with vehicle speeds limited to 1 and 2 in sec .",
    "excellent agreements between numerical simulations and theoretical results are shown in sec .",

    "let @xmath5 be the total number of cars on a 1d road of length @xmath6 .",
    "the density of cars is @xmath7 .",

    "it means that the @xmath9th car may become the neighbor of the car ahead if the car in front stops .",
    "stochastic delay is introduced in such a way that all the cars which follow the trail of their cars ahead have a probability @xmath3 to move forward one site less than it is allowed by _ step 1 _ , i.e. , we have    _ step 2 _ : @xmath14 with the probability @xmath3 , if @xmath13 and @xmath15 ,    and    _ step 3 _ : the @xmath9th car moves @xmath11 sites ahead .",
