    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) consist of two phases : prompt grb emission and subsequent afterglows . how long the prompt grb emission lasts and when the transition from the prompt grb to the afterglow occurs have been long - standing problems .",
    "these problems are tightly related to the mechanism of the central engine of grbs .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite has brought us early , dense , and detailed data on the afterglows of grbs in various observation bands .",
    "now , we are entering the era of multi - wavelength observations ; especially optical and x - ray bands , which tell us some hints for answering the problems .",
    "contrary to the expectation in the pre-_swift _ era , _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) data have revealed complex temporal behavior of the x - ray afterglow @xcite . initially , it decays very steeply , whose most popular interpretation is the tail emission of the prompt grb @xcite , although other possibilities have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at several hundreds of seconds after the burst trigger",
    ", the shallow decay phase begins until @xmath5 sec , whose origin is quite uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the shallow decay phase ends , the x - rays subsequently decays with the decay index usually steeper than unity , which was expected in the pre-_swift _ era .",
    "this decay behavior can be well explained by _ the classical external shock model _",
    "@xcite , in which neither the delayed energy injection nor time - dependency of shock micro - physics is considered .",
    "hence this phase is sometimes called _ the normal decay",
    "phase_.    however , as the number of the x - ray observations increases , it is getting suspicious that the normal decay phase arises from the external shock . in the steep and the shallow decay phases ,",
    "the x - ray light curves sometimes possess large bumps , called _ the x - ray flares _",
    "@xcite , and/or dips that can not be explained by the external shock model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for an extreme example , grb  070110 showed a rather complex x - ray afterglow with a sudden drop at @xmath6  sec after the burst trigger as the end of the shallow decay phase @xcite .",
    "these observational facts may tell us that the steep and the shallow decay phases are likely due to late internal dissipation of the energy produced by the long - acting central engine . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum remains unchanged across the shallow - to - normal transition @xcite , which may imply that the shallow and the normal decay phases are of the same origin .",
    "therefore , it might be that the normal phase comes from the internal energy dissipation .    the observed optical afterglow is also complicated and in an early epoch ( @xmath7  sec ) , there is a diversity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was found in the pre-_swift _ era that for almost all events , the behavior at @xmath8  day after the burst could be well explained by the _",
    "classical _ external shock model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although some events showed complex light curves with dips and/or bumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this epoch corresponds to the normal decay phase of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "those previous studies are mainly based on the optical bands , because the x - ray observation was sparse at that time . in the _ swift _ era",
    ", we are starting to have the simultaneous optical and x - ray afterglow data in the epoch @xmath8 day after the burst thanks to the rapid and the dense x - ray observation by the xrt .    in this letter",
    ", we study the normal decay phase of the x - ray afterglows simultaneously observed in optical r - bands , and investigate whether it is consistent with the classical external shock model or not .",
    "we perform a simple test using the optical and the x - ray decay indices , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where we use a notation , @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the classical external shock model with uniform ism , they are related to the power - law index of the electron distribution , @xmath10 , as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , since the cooling frequency @xmath13 usually lies between the optical and x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "eliminating @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , for the wind environment , we derive @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these relations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 are also valid in the case of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "therefore , through the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , one can test the classical external shock model . in the pre-_swift _ era ,",
    "similar study has been done for _ bepposax _ grbs @xcite .",
    "however , compared with the _ swift _ grbs , their x - ray data were not well enough to identify the normal decay phase and to determine the decay index with small uncertainties .",
    "we can now obtain more dense x - ray and optical data and can determine @xmath1 and @xmath0 with much less ambiguity .",
    "finally it is noted that in this letter , we do not consider the spectral indices , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , because they have at present large uncertainties ; @xmath18 fairly depends on the assumed dust model , and the low x - ray flux at the epoch we are interested in makes us difficult to constrain @xmath19 with precision which we need to test the model .",
    "we consider long grbs that are followed - up by _ swift _ xrt from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2006 .",
    "the _ swift _ xrt data are systematically analyzed using our pipeline script . the cleaned event data of the window timing ( wt ) and the photon counting ( pc ) mode from the _ swift _ science data center ( sdc ) are used in the whole process .",
    "although both wt and pc mode data are processed in the pipeline , hereafter , we are only focusing on the process of the pc mode data .",
    "the search of the x - ray afterglow counterpart , a construction of the x - ray light curve , and a fitting process of the x - ray light curve and spectra are performed automatically using the standard xrt softwares and calibration database ( heasoft 6.2 and caldb 20070531 ) .",
    "the source region is selected as a circle of 47@xmath20 radius .",
    "the background region is an annulus of an outer radius of 150@xmath20 and an inner radius of 70@xmath20 excluding the background x - ray sources detected by ximage in circle region of 47@xmath20 radius .",
    "the light curve is binned based on the number of photons required to meet at least 5@xmath4 ( sakamoto et al .",
    "we select the samples of the x - ray afterglows which have a smooth transition from the shallow to the normal decay phases at @xmath21  sec .",
    "samples with x - ray flares have been excluded .",
    "then , we find the start time of the normal decay phase of the x - ray afterglow ( @xmath22 ) , and extract events in which well - sampled r - band light curves are available during the normal decay phase .",
    "the light curve data in the r - band are published in literatures or observed by the east asian grb follow - up network ( _ eafon _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the kanata telescope .",
    "the r - band data taken by us are processed as in the following . a standard routine , including bias subtraction , dark subtraction , and flat - fielding corrections with appropriate calibration data",
    "is employed to process the data using iraf .",
    "flux calibrations are performed using the apphot package in iraf , referring to the standard stars suggested by @xcite . for each data",
    "set , the one - dimensional aperture size is set to 4 times as large as the full - width at half maximum of the objects . the magnitude of error for each optical image is estimated as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the photometric errors for each afterglow , estimated from the output of iraf phot , and @xmath25 is the photometric calibration error estimated by comparing our instrumental magnitudes .",
    "when we combine data which are obtained at several different sites , we re - calibrate each data set by our photometric manner ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these efforts decrease systematic differences and yield realistic light curves .",
    "there are 14 grbs which have a good coverage with both x - ray and optical bands at the normal decay phase . among them , optical data of 11 events have been already published in literatures . for unpublished data obtained by eafon , detailed light curves in the x - ray and the optical bands are presented elsewhere ( urata et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . for those samples",
    ", we identify the normal decay phase that is well described by a single power - law decay model and derive @xmath0 . during the phase",
    ", we find that the optical light curves are well fitted with a single power - law model in the time interval shown in table  [ tbl2 ] in which the decay index , @xmath1 , is determined .",
    "all results are summarized in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 , while figure  [ fig2 ] shows the value of @xmath2 for each event .",
    "the quoted errors in this letter are at the 1 @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "let us consider the case of the minimum frequency @xmath26 smaller than the r - band frequency @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , which is a reasonable assumption for several bright bursts in the pre-_swift _ era . in this case",
    ", the spectral index of the optical afterglow is positive , @xmath29 , which is consistent with the previous observational results ( see table  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the decay and",
    "the spectral indices are calculated as shown in table  [ table : index ] by the classical external shock model with ambient matter density dependent on the radius , @xmath30 where we assume @xmath31 .",
    "since the lorentz factor of the relativistically expanding shell evolves with the observer time as @xmath32 , @xmath33 is needed in order for the shell to decelerate . if @xmath34 , we derive @xmath35 which is valid for @xmath17 or @xmath36 , so that @xmath2 ranges between @xmath3 and @xmath37 if @xmath38 . for the cases of @xmath39 or @xmath40 , @xmath2 should be zero . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , among 14 events considered in this paper , 4 events ( grb  050319 , 050401 , 060206 , 060323 ) are below the line @xmath15 at more than the 3@xmath4 level , so that a fraction of bursts are outliers of the classical external shock model at the normal decay phase . @xcite",
    "have performed similar study and found two out of 12 events have @xmath2 significantly below @xmath3 , which was roughly consistent with our result ( see table  5 of their paper ) .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath0@xmath19 relation of the normal decay phase and found that there are several outliers of the classical external shock model .",
    "their outliers have large @xmath41 . in our sample",
    ", however , outliers of @xmath1@xmath0 relation exists even if their @xmath0 of around 1.5 , and their @xmath0@xmath19 relations are consistent with the classical external shock model ( see fig .  5 of * ?",
    "this fact , therefore , strengthens the importance of the multi - wavelength studies at the normal decay phase to test the classical external shock model .",
    "there are several possibilities leading to @xmath42 .",
    "one is to consider @xmath43 case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 , however , there is no theoretical reason to consider such a steeply rising profile .",
    "another is to consider the delayed energy injection @xcite and/or time - variable shock micro - physics parameters @xcite . here , we consider @xmath34 for simplicity .",
    "the generalized forms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are then derived by @xcite based on the assumptions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath33 .",
    "then , from their derived formula , we obtain @xmath49 which is independent of @xmath50 and @xmath14 .",
    "we find that @xmath42 is achieved if @xmath51 for the uniform ism case ( @xmath52 ) , or if @xmath53 for the wind medium case ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "note that these cases have been discussed for the pre-_swift _ grbs @xcite .",
    "another possibility to explain the outliers may be that the x - ray flares superposing on the x - ray afterglow could steep the apparent decay index of the x - ray .",
    "x - ray flares are usually more active in the initial phase , so that they may enhance the early x - ray flux . in this case",
    "the x - ray flare should not be spiky but relatively smooth , and the late afterglow is just an ordinary afterglow .",
    "although the external shock model is still viable , the afterglow emissions of outliers may be capable of the internal shock origin .",
    "such a possibility has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "then , the optical and x - ray emission in the late phase are of different origins .",
    "it is also possible in this model that a chromatic break occurs at @xmath55  day after the burst , which was believed to be achromatic in the pre-_swift _ era and to be caused by the jet collimation effects @xcite . or a cannonball model may account for our outliers @xcite",
