    "the past years have been characterized by a regain of interest in nuclear matter response functions in connection with the nuclear structure . the power of this tool to study electron , neutrino , meson and nucleon scattering on nuclei in the quasielastic peak and beyond ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) is well known .",
    "recently the formalism of the response functions has been largely employed to investigate the properties of effective nuclear forces .",
    "after the seminal work of ref .",
    "@xcite , a lot of efforts have been done in connection with the skyrme forces in order to generalize the fully - antisymmetrized random phase approximation ( rpa ) results obtained in that paper , since those calculations were limited to consider the central and the density - dependent terms of the skyrme interaction .",
    "the first generalization has been the inclusion in the rpa calculations of the spin - orbit term @xcite and after that several papers have been devoted to the inclusion of the tensor term @xcite and to the investigation of its role @xcite , up to the generalization of the formalism to asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the effects of other density - dependent terms @xcite and of the three - body forces @xcite have also been treated .",
    "a review on this topic recently appeared @xcite .",
    "the two main applications of this kind of calculations have been , up to now , the study of the unphysical finite - size instabilities in nuclear energy density functionals @xcite and the calculation of the neutrino mean free path in nuclear and neutron matter @xcite .    at variance with the case of the skyrme forces , less attention has been paid to the case of finite range gogny forces .",
    "the reason is probably twofold .",
    "first , in spite of the successes of this kind of force ( with which pairing correlations can be automatically taken into account in the mean - field based calculation , without the introduction of further parameters ) , the number of mean - field based calculations using the gogny force is enormously inferior to the number of the corresponding calculations with zero - range skyrme forces .",
    "the second reason is that , due to the finite range of the force , fully analytical calculations of the antisymmetrized rpa nuclear matter response are no longer possible because of the role played by the exchange terms . with",
    "finite range forces analytical results can be achieved only in the so called ring approximation , which takes into account only the direct contributions , or by considering the landau - migdal ( lm ) limit . the first paper devoted to the rpa response function in infinite nuclear matter employing the gogny force",
    "has been the one of gogny and padjen @xcite , which followed the lm approach .",
    "an approximation beyond the standard lm one , based on keeping the full momentum dependence in the direct term and making the lm approximation for the exchange term ( lafet ) , has been studied for the gogny force in ref .",
    "@xcite and compared with the results of a method , developed in the same paper , based on an expansion of the bethe - salpeter equation onto a spherical harmonic basis , a method that in principle can be carried out up to any degree of accuracy .",
    "another approach for the treatment of the fully antisymmetrized rpa response with finite range nuclear forces is the one based on the continued fraction ( cf ) technique .",
    "calculations employing this method , for meson - exchange type potentials , have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite by truncating the cf expansion at the first order .",
    "the calculation has then been pushed up to the second order in ref .",
    "the cf technique up to the second order has been employed also in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a gogny force .",
    "their results support the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite on the rapid convergence of the cf expansion founding , among other , that up to the saturation density the convergence is already achieved at first order .",
    "in the present paper we use the cf technique , following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we make use of the gogny force . our aim is the study of the nuclear matter response function by employing the most commonly used parametrizations of the gogny force ( d1 @xcite , d1s @xcite , d1n @xcite , d1 m @xcite ) , as well as the recent generalizations that include the tensor terms @xcite .",
    "several recent papers have shown the crucial role played by the tensor term in the behavior of the nuclear matter response functions @xcite and , as a consequence , on the finite - size spurious instabilities , but all these studies have only considered skyrme energy density functionals .",
    "very few works cope with the role of the tensor in the gogny force . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only two papers related to this subject are ref .",
    "@xcite , which performs rpa calculations of the response functions , but in the lm approximation , showing results for the d1mt force , and ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers , for the d1st and d1mt interactions , the spin susceptibilities , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath1 , @xmath2 limit of the nuclear responses .",
    "in the evaluation of response functions we shall employ green s functions techniques , as described e.  g. in refs .",
    "we consider an infinite system of nucleons at a density corresponding to a fermi momentum @xmath3 , interacting through a non - relativistic potential , whose general form , in momentum space , reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the standard tensor operator and @xmath6 represents the momentum space potential in channel @xmath7 ( here we neglect , for sake of simplicity the spin - orbit terms ) .",
    "the response of the system to an external probe can be obtained from the particle - hole ( ph ) four - point green s function @xmath8 , which is the outcome of a galitskii - migdal integral equation :    @xmath9    @xmath0 being the exact one - body green s function and @xmath10 the irreducible vertex function in the ph channel ( capital letters here refer to four - vectors ; small case letters to three - vectors ) . for brevity , in eq .",

    "one can define the polarization propagator in a given spin - isospin channel @xmath11 : @xmath12 finally , the system response functions are simply proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath13 : @xmath14 @xmath15 being the volume and @xmath16 the mass number of the system .    depending on the approximations done on @xmath0 and @xmath10",
    ", one can get different approximations for @xmath13 . by neglecting @xmath10 and dressing the nucleon propagators with the first order self - energy @xmath17 one",
    "obtains the hartree - fock ( hf ) or mean field approximation , @xmath18 .",
    "here we shall follow the usual approximation of including the mean field effects through the hf effective mass @xmath19 @xmath20 being the bare nucleon mass . by replacing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gph ] ) the irreducible vertex function @xmath10 with the matrix elements of the bare potential , one gets the rpa equation for @xmath8 .",
    "however , one still has a closed equation only for the full four - point green s function and not for the simpler polarization propagator .    in order to get the rpa response functions we shall follow the approach based on the cf expansion of the polarization propagator @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , based on the cf expansion of the effective interaction , has been developed in refs .",
    "up to second order in the cf expansion ( the highest order so far reached in actual calculations ) the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",

    "thus , the calculation of the rpa response at order @xmath25 in the cf expansion is reduced to the calculation of the exchange contributions @xmath29 up to order @xmath25 .",

    "considering now specific parametrizations , we can affirm , qualitatively speaking , that the results obtained with d1s are not so different from the ones obtained with d1 .",
    "for these two parametrizations , some difference can be observed in the @xmath59 channel .",
    "indeed , at @xmath55 @xmath54 the collective mode is above the p - h continuum for d1s , but not for d1 . at @xmath56 @xmath54 the response is quenched with respect to the hf one in the case of d1 , while there is a small enhancement for the d1s case . in this @xmath59 channel , the difference between the first and the second order in the cf expansion is more pronounced for d1s than for d1 .",
    "remaining on this @xmath59 channel , the enhancement of the responses at @xmath56 @xmath54 with respect to the hf case , as well as the discrepancy between the first and the second order in the cf expansion , are largely evident for d1 m and d1n .    without entering into the details of the behavior of the responses in the different channels for each parametrization , we just mention that at @xmath55 @xmath54 the response in the @xmath58 channel calculated with d1 m is quite different with respect to the other parametrizations .    in the @xmath61 channel the results strongly depend on the appearance ( like in the case of d1 , d1s and d1 m ) or not ( like in the case of d1n ) of the collective mode above the ph continuum .",
    "this collective mode in the @xmath62 , @xmath63 channel is the counterpart of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in finite nuclei .",
    "a large scale theoretical qrpa calculation of dipole excitations in the whole nuclear chart has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the d1s and d1 m gogny forces are used .",
    "a systematic shift toward lower energies is found for the gdr mode calculated with d1 m with respect to d1s .",
    "an equivalent shift appears in the present infinite nuclear matter results .",
    "lower energy collective modes for d1 m when compared to d1s are also found in the @xmath59 channel , here for infinite nuclear matter , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gamow - teller resonances of finite nuclei .    beyond the discussed differences related to the use of different parameter sets of the gogny force ,",
    "an important and general comment is in order : independently of @xmath64 , of the choice for the parametrization of the interaction and of the spin - isospin channel of excitation , one can observe that at low @xmath65 the difference between the results obtained at first order in the cf expansion and the ones obtained at second order is always small .",

    "another important difference between the gt2 force and these last four parametrizations is that in the gt2 case the inclusion of tensor term involved a refitting of all the parameters whereas for the other cases the tensor terms have been added to the d1s or d1 m without changing the values of the central parameters . in the same spirit also the d1st and d1mt interaction were introduced @xcite . in this case",
    "the radial part of the additional tensor - isospin term was based on the analogous one in the microscopic argonne v18 interaction , hence it was not characterized by a gaussian behaviour . in order to include also these d1st and d1mt interactions in our analysis , which is based on gaussian interactions , we have fitted the tensor component of the d1mt and d1st interaction with a sum of three gaussians .    turning to the nuclear responses , we show in figs .",

    "the good agreement between the calculations at @xmath68 , but not at @xmath70 , seems to suggest that truncating the expansion of the residual interaction at @xmath67 is not enough at large @xmath64 .",
    "this conclusion is independent on the presence of the tensor terms , since the disagreement appears also in the @xmath62 channel and since the discrepancy survives also in the comparison with the d1 m parametrization ( which does not contain tensor terms ) , as seen from the results presented in the bottom right panel of our fig .",

    "for all these four interactions we can anyway conclude that the calculation at the first order in the cf expansion can be considered enough for finite - size instabilities studies .    turning to the parametrizations of the gogny forces including tensor terms",

    "as a first instance of connection between nuclear matter and finite nuclei , we have employed the present nuclear matter approach to study the spurious finite - size instabilities . we have shown for the first time that , at variance with some zero range skyrme functionals , the most commonly used finite range d1 , d1s , d1 m gogny forces satisfy the stability criteria of ref .",
