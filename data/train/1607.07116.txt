    "the properties of the @xmath3 meson has attracted continuous attention in hadron physics .",
    "its relatively large mass than other low - lying pseudoscalar mesons , such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 , is summarized as the u@xmath6(1 ) problem @xcite , and many studies  @xcite were devoted to the role of the u@xmath6(1 ) anomaly in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . in the three - flavor system ,",
    "on the other hand , the essential role of chiral symmetry breaking in cooperation with the u@xmath6(1 ) anomaly for the generation of the @xmath3 mass is pointed out in refs .",
    ".    partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium attracts our interests ; the magnitude of the order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking is expected to be reduced in the nuclear medium  @xcite , and its possible effects on hadronic phenomena are intensively studied ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "particularly , the analyses of the pion - nucleus system suggest that such a reduction of the order parameter in the nuclear medium actually occurs with about 30% suppression of the size of the quark condensate at the normal nuclear density  @xcite .",
    "taking account of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry and the strong connection of the @xmath3 mass and chiral symmetry breaking , we expect that the mass of the @xmath3 meson is reduced in nuclear medium  @xcite though the in - medium mass of @xmath3 is concerned from the viewpoint of the effective restoration of the u@xmath6(1 ) symmetry  @xcite ; some model calculations suggest that the @xmath3 mass reduces as large as about 100 mev at the normal nuclear density in association with the chiral restoration  @xcite .",
    "then , we expect to find some information on the chiral restoration in the nuclear medium through the investigation of the @xmath3-nucleus system studied from the theoretical and experimental aspects  @xcite .    for the study of the in - medium properties of the @xmath3 meson ,",
    "the interaction between @xmath3 and nucleon @xmath7 is a basic piece .",
    "the @xmath0 system is theoretically studied in refs .",
    "experimentally , the analysis of the @xmath8 near the @xmath9 threshold suggests the existence of the narrow and shallow @xmath9 bound state @xcite , and a threshold enhancement is seen in the @xmath3 photoproduction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent analysis of the @xmath10 reaction suggests the small scattering length  @xcite .    in our previous study , we investigated the mass of the @xmath3 meson in the nuclear medium and the @xmath0 two - body interaction in free space using the three - flavor linear sigma model with nucleon  @xcite . within the leading order of the momentum expansion",
    ", we found that the attractive @xmath0 interaction is induced by the scalar meson exchange ; the @xmath11 coupling is induced by the u@xmath6(1 ) symmetry breaking , and the transition to the @xmath1 channel is suppressed by the large mass of the octet scalar meson .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is enough strong to form the @xmath0 bound state .",
    "the possible appearance of the bound - state signal in the @xmath3-photoproduction process off the deuteron is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0 system based on the linear sigma model . due to the lack of phenomenological information of the @xmath0 interaction , we make good use of theoretical consideration and symmetry properties of hadrons .",
    "the linear sigma model is one of the well - contained effective models by chiral symmetry and has the mechanism of the chiral restoration . in exploratory stage",
    ", it would be interesting to see what comes out from such theoretical analyses .",
    "certainly , once we have experimental information on the @xmath0 interaction , we should go to the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry , in which more phenomenological analyses can be done based on chiral effective theories . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the @xmath0 interaction including the @xmath12 and @xmath2 transition .",
    "we also take account of the effects of the scalar meson mixing caused by the explicit breaking of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry which was not taken into account in the previous work .",
    "the mixing induces the octet sigma meson exchange in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we also calculate the mass and width of the possible state of @xmath0 by including the scattering channels of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
