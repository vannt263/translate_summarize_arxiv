    "any measurement aimed to extract information about a quantum state alters the state itself , _",
    "i.e. _ introduces a disturbance @xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum information can not be perfectly copied , neither locally @xcite nor at distance @xcite .",
    "overall , there is an information / disturbance trade - off which unavoidably limits the accuracy of any kind of measurement , independently of the implementation scheme @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in a multiuser transmission line each user should decode the transmitted symbol and leave the carrier for the subsequent user .",
    "indeed , what they need is a device able to retrieve as much information as possible , without destroying the carrier . since in a quantum channel symbols",
    "are necessarily encoded in states of a physical system , the ultimate bounds on the channel performances are posed by quantum mechanics .    the trade - off between information gain and quantum state disturbance can be quantified using fidelities .",
    "let us describe a generic scheme for indirect measurement as a quantum operation , _",
    "i.e. _ without referring to any explicit unitary realization",
    ". the operation is described by a set of _ measurement operators @xmath1 _ , with the trace - preserving condition @xmath2 . the probability - operator measure ( povm ) of the measurement is given by @xmath3 , whereas its action on the input state is expressed as @xmath4 .",
    "this means that , if @xmath5 is the initial quantum state of the system under investigation , the probability distribution of the outcomes is given by @xmath6= \\hbox{tr}[\\varrho\\ : a^\\dag_k a_k]$ ] .",
    "the conditional output state , after having detected the outcome @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 , whereas the overall quantum state after the measurement is described by the density matrix @xmath9 .",
    "suppose you have a quantum system prepared in a pure state @xmath10 .",
    "if the outcome @xmath7 is observed at the output of the measuring device , then the estimated signal state is given by @xmath11 ( the typical inference rule being @xmath12 is left for the subsequent user .",
    "the amount of disturbance is quantified by evaluating the overlap of the conditional state @xmath13 to the initial one @xmath10 , whereas the amount of information extracted by the measurement corresponds to the overlap of the inferred state @xmath11 to the initial one .",
    "the corresponding fidelities , for a given input signal @xmath10 , are given by @xmath14 where we have already performed the average over the outcomes .",
    "the relevant quantities to assess the performances of the device are given by the average fidelities @xmath15 which are obtained by averaging @xmath16 and @xmath17 over the possible input states , _",
    "i.e. _ over the alphabet @xmath18 of transmittable symbols ( states ) .",
    "@xmath19 will be referred to as the _ transmission fidelity _ and @xmath20 to as the _ estimation fidelity_.    let us first consider two extreme cases .",
    "if nothing is done , the signal is preserved and thus @xmath21 . however , at the same time , our estimation has to be random and thus @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "this corresponds to a _ blind",
    "_ quantum repeater @xcite which re - prepares any quantum state received at the input , without gaining any information on it .",
    "the opposite case is when the maximum information is gained on the signal , _",
    "i.e. _ when the optimal estimation strategy for a single copy is adopted @xcite . in this case @xmath24 , but then the signal after this operation can not provide any more information on the initial state and thus @xmath25 . in between these two extrema",
    "there are intermediate cases , _",
    "i.e. _ quantum measurements providing only partial information while partially preserving the quantum state of the signal for subsequent users .",
    "the fidelities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not independent on each other . assuming that @xmath18 corresponds to the set of _ all _ possible quantum states , banaszek @xcite has explicitly evaluated the expressions of fidelities in terms of the measurement operators , thus rewriting eqs .",

    "( [ dbound ] ) one may derive the maximum transmission fidelity compatible with a given value of the estimation fidelity or , in other words , the minimum unavoidable amount of noise that is added , in average , to a set of random qudits if one wants to acquire a given amount of information .",
    "notice that the trade - off crucially depends on the alphabet of transmittable symbols .",
    "ultimate bound on fidelities have been derived for different set of signals .",

    "in this paper we review our results @xcite on the unitary realizations of optimal estimation of qudits and present novel results about the information / disturbance trade - off in a multiuser transmission line .",
    "as we will see , our schemes are _ minimal _ , since they involve a single additional probe qudit , and _ optimal _",
