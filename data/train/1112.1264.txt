    "it is well known that in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with a continuous symmetry the conventional long - range order is prevented by thermal fluctuations at finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit , and as a result no spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking takes place .",
    "however , these systems can undergo a transition through binding of vortex pairs to form a quasi - long - range order .",
    "this is the celebrated berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the 2d xy model is the prototype to elaborate on the bkt transition .",
    "experimentally , the bkt transition has been examined in various physicsl systems , including @xmath0 films @xcite ,",
    "2d superconductors @xcite and superconducting josephson - junction arrays ( jja ) @xcite , and experimental works agree well with theoretical predictions .",
    "the study of josephson - junction arrays greatly enriched the research of the bkt transition @xcite . once a transverse magnetic field is introduced to jja , the bkt transition point as a function of the field",
    "can be investigated @xcite .",
    "theoretically , such a system can be described by the frustrated 2d xy model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these systems reveal a complex energy spectrum , known as the  hofstadter butterfly \" @xcite , which gives rise to rich phenomena that are still of present research interest .",
    "so far , cold atoms have been regarded as ideal test beds for fundamental models of condensed matter physics .",
    "it is of great interest to examine the bkt transition since the quasi-2d bose gas has already been produced either in a single pancake traps or at the nodes of one - dimensional optical lattice potentials @xcite .",
    "trombettoni it et al .",
    "has raised a proposal to investigate the occurrence of the bkt transition in a 2d scalar bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the bkt transition in atomic bose gases was first experimentally realized in 2006 by hadzibabic @xcite .",
    "they added the optical lattice in the @xmath1 direction to construct a quasi - two - dimensional configuration , and the transition was detected by the dislocations of interference patterns .",
    "later experiments identify this transition by the proliferation of vortex pairs @xcite and a bimodal density distribution or coherent length @xcite .",
    "the newly developed technic of synthetic magnetic field in cold atoms use the light - modulated excitation between nearby neighbor sites to construct a `` magnetic field '' like effective hamiltonian in a 2d optical lattice @xcite .",
    "this technic opens the door for cold atoms to simulate some more profound models , e.g. the lattice gauge theory .",
    "thus it stimulates us to re - examine the behavior of bkt transition in the cold atomic bose gases subject to the synthetic magnetic field . comparing with the former 2d experimental systems concerning on the superfluid density or sheet resistance to detect the superfluid transition ,",
    "cold atoms can be manipulated more easier and precisely and thus it benefits for further investigation of the bkt transition .",
    "we start with the bose - hubbard model which describes a 2d bose gas in uniform magnetic field in a square optical lattice .",
    "this model can be mapped to the frustrated xy model .",
    "then we study the bkt transition using the standard metropolis monte carlo method .",
    "this method has been used by trombettoni _",
    "_ to investigate the bkt transition in a atomic bose gases in a 2d optical lattice without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the transition point is determined through detecting the central peak of the expansion condensate after time - of - flight ( tof ) expansion .",
    "consider a 2d bose gas immersed into a uniform magnetic field in a square optical lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system can be described by the frustrated bose - hubbard model : @xmath2 where the first term on the right side is the hopping energy with the summation over the nearest neighbor sides and @xmath3 is the hopping matrix element .",
    "@xmath4(@xmath5 ) is the field operator of bosons for annihilate(create ) a boson at site @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is a bond operator describing the magnetic field and around every plaquette we have : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the uniform frustration with @xmath10 the flux quantum and we have chosen unit lattice constant @xmath11 . the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) refers to the on - site repulsive(attractive ) interaction , according to the interacting strength @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the particle number operator on site @xmath6 .",
    "the system under consideration is a uniform system at sufficient low temperature , such that the system is density coherent with fluctuating phases .",
    "the field operator of bosons can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the average particle number of each site and @xmath16 is the corresponding phase on site @xmath6 .",
    "the mechanism of bkt transition , the pairing of vortices , is due to topological long - range correlation , thus we can safely ignore the on - site interaction term at sufficient low temperature . upon these ,",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) can be mapped to the frustrated xy model : @xmath17 here @xmath18 .",
    "this model was first used by titel _",
    "_ to describe the superconducting josephson arrays in transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we note here that the frustrated xy model is @xmath19 gauge symmetry breaking in the superfluid state as the hopping term breaks the conservation of `` charge '' .",
    "it is to say that in a conventional system described by the frustrated xy model physical quantities can be gauge dependent , however , all observable quantities should be gauge invariant .",
    "however this is not the case in the cold atoms experiment that the observable physical quantities , e.g. , the momentum distribution of the wave function are gauge dependent .",
    "there is no paradox and on the other hand they are compatible in the case that the imaging of density of the expanding condensates in cold atoms experiment are in fact the canonical momentum of the original model @xcite .",
    "this just reflects nothing but the exitance of vector gauge potential .",
    "in the case of synthetic magnetic field we choose the landau gauge , which is : @xmath20 obviously the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2 ] ) is periodic in @xmath21 with the period 1 , thus we only need to study the properties of the system in the interval @xmath22 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath23 corresponds to the unfrustrated case and @xmath24 is the fully frustrated condition .",
    "the wave function of the system in the lattice space @xmath25 can be calculated using the monte carlo method . at low temperature",
    "the system undergo a superfluid transition and there will be a peak in the central of the wave function in the momentum space , which is fourier transformed as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of sites of the square lattice .",
    "the central peak of the momentum space describes the coherence of the phase of the condensates .",
    "it is analogous to the magnetization of a spin system , i.e. , @xmath28    in cold atoms experiments , the observation of momentum distribution can be detected by the sudden release of the optical lattice .",
    "the absorption imaging is taken after a tof period @xmath29 .",
    "the density profile of the image can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 here momentum @xmath31 is related to position @xmath32 by @xmath33 under the assumption of ballistic expansion .",
    "@xmath34 is the fourier transform of the wannier function and @xmath35 is the momentum space density matrix and is defined by : @xmath36    for density coherent states at low temperature , the system forms a quasi - condensate where on each site of the lattice there is a small condensate and we can have @xmath37 .",
    "thus the momentum space density matrix @xmath35 can be written as : @xmath38    in this case , the momentum space wave function is related to the density matrix and then can be observed experimentally using the tof imaging . in the following",
    "we will do the monte carlo simulation and investigate the transition behavior under different frustration @xmath21 , which can be directed realized in cold atoms experiments .",
    "we now use the standard metropolis monte carlo method with periodical boundary conditions to simulate the frustrated xy model .",

    "the system is in a superfluid state and the density profile reveals regular sharp peaks at the momentum space lattices .",
    "that is due to the pairing of vortices .",
    "as the temperature increasing the peaks begin to decay and at the transition point at about @xmath43 the sharp peaks go to zero . that s the signature of bkt transition of 2d bose gases .",
