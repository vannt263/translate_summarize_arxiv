    "oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems are generally reduced to the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation by means of the so - called center - manifold reduction when the local oscillators are close to their supercritical hopf bifurcation point@xcite .",
    "this fact led to a now widely accepted view that , without resorting to individual systems , one may concentrate on cgl if one wishes to gain a qualitative understanding of some universal dyanmical features shared commonly by a broad class of oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "this view in fact underlies a vast amount of work in the past ( see @xcite for review ) devoted to cgl .",
    "however , due to its local nature of coupling , cgl may fail to capture some important aspects of the dynamics characteristic to a certain class of oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "in fact , it was argued recently that a situation may arise where the oscillator coupling becomes effectively nonlocal , and as a consequence the system exhibits such peculiar dynamics as can never be seen in cgl @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there remains a yet unexplored area of reaction - diffusion systems where nonlocal effects on the pattern dynamics must seriously be considered . in the present paper , we are concerned with how this area is still accessible within the framework of the center - manifold reduction .",
    "it will turn out that this can actually be achieved by a slight extension of the conventional reduction scheme .",
    "effective nonlocality in coupling may become relevant when the reaction - diffusion system involves three or more chemical components .",
    "suppose that the system of concern is such that the chemical components constituting the local oscillators are free of diffusion , i.e. , the oscillators remain uncoupled , while the system involves an extra diffusive component which , for its diffusive nature , plays the role of a coupling agent . by eliminating mathematically this diffusive component",
    ", the system becomes a field of nonlocally coupled oscillators possibly involving delay also .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to achieve a reduction of such reaction - diffusion systems to a universal equation of the ginzburg - landau type without missing the effects of nonlocality .",
    "it may seem that the center - manifold idea would not work for our purpose because cgl is believed to be quite a general result of the center - manifold reduction .",
    "still there seems to be a way out within the same framework if we slightly extend the conventional method of reduction .",
    "note first that under usual conditions the disappearance of the effects of nonlocality near the bifurcation point comes from that the characteristic wavelength @xmath0 of the pattern becomes far longer than the effective coupling radius .",
    "if so , it may happen that nonlocality persists even close to the bifurcation point when the system involves a certain parameter whose suitable tuning as the bifurcation point is approached keeps @xmath0 comparable with the effective radius of coupling .",
    "similar physical idea lies behind the multiple bifurcation theory which aims to capture such complex dynamics as is absent in the vicinity of a simple bifurcation point .",
    "section ii starts with introducing a universal class of oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems involving three or more chemical components .",
    "after briefly discussing its physical relevance , we proceed to its reduction near the hopf bifurcation .",
    "if a certain parameter associated with the strength of effective nonlocal coupling is as small as the bifurcation parameter , the reduced equation turns out to take the form of a nonlocally coupled complex ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "analytic formulae for some coefficients of this equation are given , which would be of great help in inferring possible ranges of the parameters in the original system where nonlocality - dominated pattern dynamics is expected .",
    "regarding the derivation of the reduced equation , our primary concern is the case when direct oscillator coupling is absent , but the effects of weak diffusive ( i.e.  direct ) coupling will also be considered . in section iii ,",
    "linear stability analysis of our nonlocal cgl is carried out about the uniform oscillation .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue spectra , especially those of the phase branch , can be qualitatively different from those of the standard cgl , whose physical implication is discussed .",
    "a short summary will be given in the final section .",
    "the reaction - diffusion model of our concern was previously proposed by one of the present authors@xcite and is given by the general form @xmath1 here the @xmath2-dimensional real vector field @xmath3 represents a local limit - cycle oscillator with dynamical variable @xmath4 , so that the first equation with @xmath5 represents a field of continuously distributed oscillators without mutual coupling .",
    "the full system involves an additional chemical component with concentration @xmath6 whose dynamics is governed by the second equation .",
    "this component simply diffuses and decays at a constant rate , while it is produced locally as represented by the term @xmath7 , the production rate depending on the local value of @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the local oscillators is influenced in return by the local concentration of @xmath6 , and this effect is represented by the term @xmath8 . for the sake of convenience , we inserted in eq .",
    "( 2 ) parameter @xmath9 to indicate explicitly the time constant of @xmath6 , anticipating a limiting case in which @xmath9 is vanishingly small .",
    "note that there is no direct coupling among the local oscillators , while their indirect coupling is provided by the diffusive chemical represented by @xmath6 .",
    "in later discussions , we will generalize the above model by assuming @xmath10 and @xmath11 to depend both on @xmath4 and @xmath6 , and also by including a small diffusion term i.e.  weak direct coupling in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . throughout the present paper , the spatial extension of the system",
    "is supposed sufficiently large .",
    "let the spatially uniform steady state of our system be given by @xmath12 , or equivalently , we measure @xmath4 and @xmath6 always from their equilibrium values .",
    "thus , we clearly have @xmath13 .",
    "it is also convenient to arrange @xmath3 and @xmath10 so that the equalities @xmath14 may be satisfied .",
    "if we like , @xmath6 may be eliminated from the system by solving eq .",
    "( 2 ) , which can be done explicitly because the equation is linear . if the spatial dimension is @xmath15 , the solution of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spatial fourer transform of @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) with @xmath6 given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) constitutes a field of nonlocally coupled oscillators .",
    "note that the nonlocality appears in time as well as in space , and the characteristic scales in time and space associated with the nonlocality are given by @xmath9 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this fact will be used in the discussion below .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 involves a parameter @xmath20 such that if @xmath21 each local system given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with @xmath22 has a stable fixed point @xmath12 while this becomes oscillatory unstable for @xmath23 ; namely , at @xmath24 a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of the jacobian associated with each local system about the fixed point cross the imaginary axis of the complex plane , while the other eigenvalues all remain in the left half plane .",
    "it is a well known fact that the center - manifold reduction can be applied to reaction - diffusion systems near the hopf bifurcation point of the local oscillators@xcite .",
    "this leads generally to the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation @xmath25 where the amplitude @xmath26 and the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generally complex .",
    "the small parameter @xmath20 has been retained in eq .",
    "( 4 ) so that @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 scale like @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the above reduced form of reaction - diffusion systems remains valid also for our particular system given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "since cgl is a diffusively coupled ( i.e. locally coupled ) system , it may seem that effective nonlocality in coupling characteristic to our system disappears completely near the bifurcation point .",
    "the reason for the disappearance of nonlocality is clear .",
    "this is because the characteristic wavelength @xmath0 of the field @xmath4 becomes longer and longer as the bifurcation point is approached like @xmath35 so that the effective coupling radius given by @xmath19 comes to fall well within this scale , which gives nothing but the definition of local coupling . in what follows , we will be concerned with a special situation in which spatial ( and possibly temporal ) nonlocality can survive even close to the bifurcation point , so that the reduced equation involves nonlocal coupling rather than diffusive coupling .",
    "the same result was used already in earlier works@xcite for the particular case of vanishingly small @xmath9 without showing how the reduction can actually be achieved .",
    "we will develop below the reduction procedure explicitly including the case of finite @xmath9 .",
    "consider our system given by the form of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) for which eq .",
    "( 4 ) gives the right reduced form near @xmath24 provided there is no small parameter other than @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear that the diffusion term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is the reduced form of the coupling term @xmath8 in eq .",
    "this implies that @xmath36 .",
    "disappearance of spatial nonlocality is consistent with the fact that the characteristic wavelength @xmath0 estimated from the dimensional argument for eq .",
    "( 4 ) , which confirms @xmath37 , is far larger than the effective coupling radius given by @xmath19 provided @xmath38 remains an ordinary magnitude .",
    "this consistency is apparently broken if @xmath38 becomes as small as @xmath20 by which @xmath0 becomes independent of @xmath20 and hence can be comparable with the coupling radius . putting it differently , spatial nonlocality should remain relevant near the bifurcation point provided the strength of coupling between the local oscillators and the diffusive component becomes so weak as to satisfy @xmath39 thus , what we do next is to find a reduced equation valid near the doubly singular point @xmath40 . before proceeding to this issue ,",
    "however , we make a remark on _ temporal _ nonlocality .",
    "temporal nonlocality , which is characterized by the time constant @xmath9 , may be relevant to the dynamics even near the bifurcation point . however , this effect would never appear as a non - markoffian form of the reduced equation for the amplitude @xmath26 because the time scale associated with the variation of @xmath26 is much longer than @xmath9 .",
    "still , @xmath9 could be comparable with the period of the basic oscillation .",
    "then , as we see below , the effect of delay may appear in the reduced equation through the change in the space - dependence of the coupling function . specifically ,",
    "when @xmath9 is finite , the decay of the coupling function with distance becomes oscillatory rather than monotone .",
    "suppose first that @xmath5 .",
    "then the reduced form of the ordinary equation ( 1 ) is given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) with @xmath41 .",
    "although its derivation is routine , we now recapitulate it for the purpose of explaining soon later how easily the reduced equation can be generalized when a small coupling term is introduced .",
    "let the taylor expansion of @xmath42 in terms of @xmath4 be written as @xmath43 regarding the @xmath20-dependence of the coefficients appearing in the above expansion , we need to consider it only for the jacobian @xmath44 to the first order in @xmath20 like @xmath45 ; higher order corrections to @xmath44 as well as @xmath20-dependence of @xmath46 , @xmath47 etc .",
    "are irrelevant to the reduced equation to the leading order .",
    "let the pure imaginary eigenvalues at @xmath24 be @xmath48 , and the corresponding right eigenvectors and its complex conjugate are written as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding left eigenvectors and its complex conjugate are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "these eigenvectors satisfy @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath20 is nonvanishing but small , the eigenvalues change to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .    to the lowest order in @xmath20 , the original field @xmath4 and the complex amplitude @xmath26 are mutually related via @xmath57 thus , in this approximation we have @xmath58 .",
    "this means further that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) with @xmath41 is identical with the reduced form of @xmath59 , or @xmath60 the standard analysis determines the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath29 in terms of some parameters of the equations before reduction .",
    "it is clear that the linear coefficient @xmath27 is given by @xmath61 for obtaining @xmath29 , the lowest order expression for @xmath4 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) is insufficient , and we have to use a more precise formula including the next order term : @xmath62 where @xmath63 using these quantities , @xmath29 is given by @xmath64    suppose that the vector field @xmath3 is modified slightly to @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that the corresponding reduced equation must also be modified slightly with an additive term @xmath66 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath67 of our concern is the small coupling term @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath6 given by eq .  ( 3 ) . the original variable @xmath4 and the reduced one @xmath26",
    "must now be regarded as depending on space as well as on time .",
    "thus , our problem is to find a reduced form of the quantity @xmath68 using eq .",
    "since @xmath38 is already small , we only need to consider the most dominant contribution to @xmath69 . noting that @xmath70",
    ", we may use a linear approximation @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( 7 ) with @xmath4 and @xmath26 supposed to depend also on @xmath31 , we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 note that eq .  ( 16 ) ignores the contribution from the complex conjugate of @xmath76 which would give rise to a rapidly oscillating component of @xmath69 .",
    "this is allowed because such component would be averaged out in the equation describing the slow evolution of @xmath76 .",
    "since the time - integral in eq .",
    "( 16 ) extends practically over the interval between @xmath77 and @xmath30 , the slowly varying amplitude @xmath78 may safely be replaced with @xmath79 . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 note that @xmath83 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath84 thus the final form of the reduced equation becomes @xmath85 which we call nonlocally coupled complex ginzburg - landau equation or simply nonlocal cgl .",
    "it is clear that the situation of interest is such that @xmath86 for which the coupling term in the reduced equation is balanced in magnitude with the other terms even if the characteristic wavelength is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the bifurcation is supercritical , i.e. , the real part of @xmath29 is positive .    a few generalizations of the original system ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) can be made .",
    "firstly , @xmath10 and @xmath11 may depend both on @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "since the most dominant part of these quantities alone is relevant to the reduced equation , one may safely approximate @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . the resulting new term @xmath91 may slightly modify @xmath42 , but the modified @xmath42",
    "may again be denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath6 is small , @xmath92 is practically linear in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , this quantity simply modifies the linear decay rate of @xmath6 which can be normalized by a suitable rescaling of time . in this way ,",
    "the final result of reduction is unchanged except that @xmath93 and @xmath7 are replaced with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . as the second generalization",
    ", we may include in eq .",
    "( 1 ) a diffusion term like @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a diagonal diffusion matrix with non - negative elements . in parallel with the above argument for obtaining a reduced form of the nonlocal coupling term , the reduced form of the quantity @xmath98",
    "will then be added to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 22 ) . to the lowest order approximation",
    ", one may apply eq .",
    "( 7 ) for @xmath4 , by which the above quantity becomes @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a complex number with positive real part , and is given by @xmath101 thus , eq .",
    "( 22 ) is modified as @xmath102 in the conventional reduction of reaction - diffusion systems , @xmath103 is assumed to be of ordinary magnitude , so that the diffusion term can be balanced with the linear and cubic terms in magnitude only if the characteristic wavelength of @xmath26 scales like @xmath34",
    ". however , the last property of @xmath26 contradicts with the particular situation of our concern in which the characteristic wavelength remains independent of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we assume that @xmath103 as well as @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath20 , by which all terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 25 ) are balanced with each other , and the coupling nonlocality represented by the last term can survive .",
    "it is more convenient to write eq .",
    "( 25 ) in the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 . with this form",
    ", the coupling term can be approximated by a diffusion term when the characteristic wavelength of @xmath106 is sufficiently longer than the coupling radius .",
    "note that @xmath107 remains ordinary magnitude because @xmath108 by assumption .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the system is supercritical or @xmath109    an additional remark should be made on the functional form of the coupling function @xmath110 in connection with the time scale @xmath9 of the diffusive component @xmath6 . as implied by eq .",
    "( 16 ) , finite @xmath9 generally gives rise to memory effects or temporal nonlocality after the variable @xmath6 has been eliminated .",
    "however , as was noted before , the reduced equation is free from memory effects because the time scale of the slowly varying amplitude @xmath26 is much longer than @xmath9 .",
    "we also noted that because @xmath9 may be comparable with the period @xmath111 of the fundamental oscillation , the effect of delay in coupling should be relevant to the reduced dynamics .",
    "actually , as is clear from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , the effect of finite @xmath9 appears in the coupling function @xmath110 . for one - dimensional systems , in particular ,",
    "the coupling function is simply expressed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath9 is vanishing , @xmath115 decays exponentially with @xmath116 , the decay length being given by @xmath19 , whereas the decay becomes oscillatory when @xmath9 is finite .",
    "thus the effect of delay in coupling is such that the complex amplitude @xmath117 in the coupling term is multiplied by a factor @xmath118 , or equivalently , the phase of @xmath119 , denoted by @xmath120 , is replaced with @xmath121 . in the physical language",
    ", this means that the phase at the spatial point @xmath122 experienced by the oscillator at @xmath123 through the delayed coupling can not be its current value @xmath120 but should be the value at some time @xmath124 in the past , because the phase information travels at a finite speed .",
    "if this speed is constant , and the oscillation at @xmath122 is nearly regular , then we have @xmath125 equal to @xmath120 plus something proportional to the distance @xmath126 , justifying the above result .    coming back to general space dimensions , eq .",
    "( 26 ) with the coupling function given by eq .",
    "( 19 ) involves many parameters .",
    "however , some of the parameters can be eliminated by suitable transformations of some variables .",
    "firstly , the imaginary part of the linear coefficient @xmath127 vanishes through the transformation @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "secondly , one may rescale @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in such a way that @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 may all become unity . in this way , we may write eq .  ( 26 ) as    @xmath132    where the coupling function @xmath110 is defined as an integral form given by eq .  ( 19 ) , or @xmath133    the reduced equation now involves six independent parameters @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 all of which are independent of smallness parameters @xmath20 , @xmath38 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that the coupling coefficient in eq .",
    "( 30 ) is related to some original parameters through @xmath140 or @xmath141 so that , by combining the last equation with the inequality ( 27 ) and the original assumption @xmath142 , we have a restrictive condition @xmath143",
    "it is clear that eq .  (",
    "30 ) admits a family of plane wave solutions @xmath144 $ ] the stability of which is extremely important to the understanding of the pattern dynamics of our system . in the present paper we will focus on the stability of the uniform oscillation @xmath145 for which @xmath146    we now put @xmath147 and linearize eq .",

    "let the solutions of eq .",
    "( 39 ) be denoted by @xmath156 and @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "the uniform oscillation is stable if and only if @xmath159 holds for all @xmath160 .",
    "this holds only when @xmath161 and @xmath162 for all q. equivalently , if one of these inequalities becomes violated for a certain @xmath160 , then the uniform oscillation loses stability .",
    "this implies that the types of instability could be classified in terms of the signs of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "simple calculation shows that @xmath163 and @xmath164 can be expressed in the following form where we use the notation @xmath165 .",
    "@xmath166 here @xmath167 and @xmath168 are non - negative functions of @xmath169 , and @xmath170 figure 1 shows the @xmath171-@xmath172 plane divided into three domains ( labeled by a , b and c ) corresponding to qualitatively different forms of @xmath163 . note that the @xmath171-@xmath172 plane covers all possible types of @xmath163 because @xmath173 is positive definite .",
    "similar picture for @xmath164 in the @xmath174-@xmath175 plane is displayed in fig .",
    "2 where the whole space is divided into four domains ( labeled by a@xmath176 to d@xmath176 ) . since the parameters @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 as functions of four independent parameters @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath181 and @xmath135 can be changed independently , every combination between two members , one from the group ( a , b , c ) and the other from ( a@xmath176,b@xmath176,c@xmath176,d@xmath176 ) , is possible .",
    "uniform oscillation is unstable for all these combinations except for ( a , a@xmath176 ) .",

    "2 can now be translated into critical relations between @xmath136 and @xmath190 under fixed @xmath191 and @xmath137 . in this way , we have four types of eigenvalue spectrum shown schematically in fig .  3 where lines @xmath192 and @xmath193 correspond to @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "the figure shows the spectra only for phase - like fluctuations , because in each case the amplitude branch which is separated from the phase branch remains negative for all @xmath160 so that the amplitude - like fluctuations are irrelevant to stability .",
    "separation between the phase and amplitude branches also implies that the eigenvalues associated with these branches are all real .",
    "in contrast , if these branches merge , then the eigenvalues of the two branches for given @xmath160 would form a complex conjugate pair .",
    "note that in each type of spectrum shown in the figure the eigenvalue saturates to a constant as the wavenumber tends to infinity , which is characteristic to nonlonally coupled systems .",
    "the characteristic wavenumber about which the eigenvalue starts to saturate equals the inverse of the coupling radius .",
    "physically , this reflects the fact that the dynamics of fluctuations whose wavelengths are much shorter than the coupling radius is practically the same as the oscillators individual dynamics , and hence it is insensitive to the wavenumber . note also that the type u@xmath194 spectrum is possible only when @xmath137 is nonvanishing or , equivalently , when the nonlocal coupling before reduction involves delay .",
    "for larger @xmath187 , the phase and amplitude branches can merge , so that oscillatory instability becomes possible .",

    "for instance , the stability diagram for the case of @xmath199 and @xmath200 is displayed in fig .",
    "5 where the line @xmath201 gives the boundary associated with the last type of instability .    finally , we comment on the effects of weak diffusion represented by the term @xmath202 in eq .",
    "( 30 ) . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath203 is vanishing while @xmath155 is a small positive .",
    "it is clear that this diffusion term simply gives rise to an additional stabilizing term @xmath204 to each of the eigenvalues @xmath205 as a function of @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the fluctuations with sufficiently short wavelength are always decaying . a particularly interesting result from",

    "even the dispersion curves of types u@xmath206 and u@xmath207 could be deformed into a similar form if some parameter vaules are chosen suitably .",
    "it is clear that there is a critical value of @xmath138 at which fluctuations with a certain wavenumber @xmath208 become unstable . due to the presence of long - wavelength fluctuations which are almost neutral in stability",
    ", the unstable growth of the mode with @xmath208 will generally be unable to lead to a turing type periodic standing pattern . instead , from the outset ,",
    "a group of modes with wavenumbers close to @xmath208 will couple nonlinearly with another group of modes of almost vanishing @xmath160 with almost neutral stability , leading to a peculiar spatio - temporal chaos@xcite .",
    "the simple evolution equation @xmath209u-(\\partial _ { x}u)^{2},\\ ] ] called the nikolaevskii equation@xcite , gives qualitatively the same eigenvalue spectrum as those in fig .",
    "actually , it was argued previously that the turing pattern in this system existing for small positive @xmath210 is always unstable , and as a result the system immediately becomes turbulent characterized by the coexistence of turbulent fluctuations with vastly different length scales .",
    "possibility of this type of turbulence in reaction - diffusion systems was discussed by fujisaka and yamada@xcite . in electro - convective systems ,",

    "if spatially distributed limit cycle oscillators are diffusively coupled not directly but via a certain diffusive component , the oscillators may be viewed as coupled nonlocally after a mathematical elimination of this diffusive variable .",
    "we showed in the present paper that this actually occurs in reaction - diffusion systems and that the nonlocality of this kind persists even close to the hopf bifurcation point provided the coupling between each local oscillator and the diffusive component is sufficiently weak .",
    "specifically , under this condition , the systems is reduced to a comlex ginzburg - landau type equation with nonlocal rather than diffusive coupling .",
    "temporal nonlocality or memory effects which generally exist before reduction does not appear explicitly in the reduced equation , still they may generally affect the functional form of the coupling function .",
    "our results were generalized so as to include the effects of direct but weak diffusive coupling among the oscillators .",
    "linear stability analysis of the uniformly oscillating state of the reduced equation was also carried out .",

    "3 was found to lead to turbulence with multi - affinity@xcite .",
    "it was also found that even the normal spectrum ( type s ) can give rise to peculiar spiral waves without phase singularity when the nonlocal coupling becomes weak@xcite .",
