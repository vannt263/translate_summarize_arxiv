    "what physical resources are needed to simulate the evolution of an arbitrary physical system ? in the context of information processing ,",
    "the ability to perform _ universal _ computation is equivalent to the ability to simulate an arbitrary evolution  any computation is performed by evolving a computing machine , and conversely , a universal computing machine can be used to simulate the evolution of any system .    in the standard quantum circuit model of quantum computation @xcite ,",
    "a quantum computation involves initializing quantum systems  typically _ qubits _ or two - level quantum systems  that are then acted on by a sequence of _ quantum gates _ , followed by some measurements . in this model , simple quantum gates ( say , acting on one or two qubits at a time )",
    "can be used to build up an _ arbitrary _ unitary transformation .",
    "nonunitary evolution such as dissipation can also be simulated in this model by introducing and later discarding ancilla qubits .",
    "since measurement is generally irreversible , until recently the conventional wisdom has held that the processing of quantum information should be kept coherent and measurements should be delayed until the final read - out of computation results .",
    "a notable exception to this rule of thumb is quantum teleportation  @xcite , in which a measurement by one party determines the correction that a remote party should apply to recover a quantum state .",
    "another notable exception is the use of syndrome measurements in quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "syndrome measurements reveal the error that has occurred without measuring the encoded quantum state , thereby preserving its coherence . indeed , there are many approaches to fault - tolerant quantum computation in which measurements and simple quantum gates are used to implement other quantum gates that are difficult to apply directly  @xcite .",
    "raussendorf and briegel  @xcite overturned this conventional wisdom , showing that it is possible to perform universal quantum computation using a _ sequence of single - qubit measurements alone _ , acting on some fixed entangled state called a _ cluster state",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "once the cluster state is prepared , no further interactions are required , and the only aspect of the computation that must remain coherent is the storage of quantum information .",
    "more precisely , _ any _ quantum circuit up to depth @xmath0 and breadth @xmath1 may be simulated using a single , fixed cluster state of @xmath2 qubits .",
    "each simulation of a quantum gate is successful up to an additional known pauli error .",
    "since the act of measuring the cluster state is irreversible , this model is referred to as the _ one - way quantum computer _ ( 1wqc ) model .",
    "after the 1wqc was introduced , a very different measurement - based scheme for quantum computation was introduced by one of us  @xcite , following the line of thought developed in  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this model as a _ teleportation - based model of quantum computation _",
    "( tqc ) , since it is conceptually derived from teleportation .",
    "the tqc uses similar physical resources to the 1wqc : ( multiple - qubit ) measurements , quantum memory , and feedforward .",
    "the initial tqc scheme proposed in  @xcite uses four - qubit measurements .",
    "it also requires a nondeterministic number of steps to perform each quantum gate .",
    "simpler tqc schemes were later proposed @xcite , with the simplest using only two - qubit measurements and performing each gate deterministically ( up to a known pauli error ) .",
    "the tqc is easy to understand since it is similar to the standard model of quantum computation . in comparison , the conceptual basis for",
    "the 1wqc is less clear .",
    "the prescriptions given in  @xcite for using a 1wqc can be easily verified , but there is no clear underlying principle .",
    "this makes it nontrivial to modify or optimize the existing 1wqc schemes .",
    "it is also unclear what makes the cluster state a good substrate for quantum computation , and more generally , what makes a good or bad substrate .",
    "finally , the 1wqc formalism is heavily based on the stabilizer language developed by gottesman  @xcite .",
    "although this language is powerful , it is also rather specialized , being limited primarily to the analysis of situations in which operations from a special set  the clifford group  are being applied .",
    "furthermore , the connection between the stabilizer language and the corresponding picture in terms of state vectors is not always straightforward .",
    "on the other hand , the 1wqc has important advantages over the tqc .",
    "first , no quantum interactions are required after the initial preparation of the cluster state .",
    "second , the cluster state is independent of the computation to be performed , except for its breadth and depth : arbitrary interactions can be extracted from the fixed cluster state .",
    "third , there may be physical systems in which a cluster state offers experimental advantages over more conventional approaches  @xcite .",
    "our initial goal in undertaking the research reported here was to identify simple underlying principles for the 1wqc and to systematically derive schemes similar to the proposed 1wqc .",
    "we eventually found such a systematic derivation using teleportation as an underlying principle @xcite , in accord with the conjecture that the 1wqc and the tqc are closely related .",
    "our improved conceptual understanding of the 1wqc proved valuable , for we subsequently found much simpler 1wqc - like schemes  @xcite by choosing a simpler underlying principle , known as `` one - bit teleportation '' @xcite .",
    "such simplification is reminiscent of the work in  @xcite , which simplifies the systematic fault - tolerant gate construction proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we then realized that one - bit teleportation also simplifies schemes in the tqc model  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore unified the 1wqc and the tqc models and obtained simplified measurement - based quantum computation schemes .",
    "the 1wqc schemes we derive combine the conceptual simplicity of the tqc with the practical advantages of the 1wqc .",
    "we have also identified one - bit teleportation as a single principle underlying all existing approaches to measurement - based quantum computation .    during the course of our investigation and preparation of the manuscript ,",
    "several related results have been reported .",
    "a different explanation of the 1wqc model in terms of valence bond solids was reported by verstraete and cirac @xcite . whereas our 1wqc - like schemes differ from the original schemes of @xcite , an exact explanation of the latter in terms of teleportation",
    "was given by aliferis and one of us @xcite .",
    "a partial explanation of the 1wqc model in terms of one - bit teleportation was reported very recently by jorrand and perdrix @xcite , while schemes similar to our simplified tqc schemes were independently reported by perdrix @xcite .",
    "several results announced after our initial posting may also be of interest .",
    "these include a model of measurement - based universal quantum turing machines @xcite , further results on combining the 1wqc with linear optics @xcite and a new fault - tolerance study in the 1wqc @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in by briefly reviewing the circuit model , introducing a notion of circuit simulation with pauli errors , and describing the tqc and 1wqc models of quantum computation in more detail .",
    "we emphasize some conceptual ideas that may be useful elsewhere .",
    "reviews one - bit teleportation and presents useful techniques obtained from it .",
    "the techniques are used to derive a simplified tqc scheme in .",
    "explains how one - bit teleportation can be used to derive a scheme that simulates arbitrary circuits using only an entangled initial state , single - qubit measurements , and feedforward . here",
    "the initial state depends on the circuit to be simulated .",
    "explains several techniques to remove the dependence of the initial state on the circuit being simulated ( except for its breadth and depth ) .",
    "a short conclusion of the paper is given in .",
    "our initial systematic derivation of 1wqc - like schemes based on teleportation can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarize the circuit model of quantum computation as a way of introducing the notation used throughout the paper .",
    "we describe a notion of circuit simulation that is crucial to our discussion .",
    "then , we outline the main features of the tqc and the 1wqc that motivate our derivation . since we derive simplified tqc and 1wqc schemes , a full summary of the existing schemes will be omitted .",
    "finally , we describe a diagrammatic representation of the 1wqc , which we call the _ substrate representation_.      any unitary evolution can be built from simple quantum gates ( say , acting on one or two qubits at a time ) .",
    "a circuit diagram represents a sequence of unitary evolutions and measurements .",
    "the input states and measurement outcomes may be included . in a circuit diagram",

    "each horizontal line represents quantum information propagating forward in time , or equivalently , quantum storage .",
    "often , each line represents one qubit of quantum information .",
    "a unitary gate is represented by a box on the line(s ) , and a symbol for the gate is written inside the box .",
    "thus , the circuit symbol for a single - qubit gate @xmath3 is given by ( 30,12 ) ( 0,6)(1,0)10 ( 10,1)(10,10)@xmath3 ( 20,6)(1,0)10 [ eq : u ] in the basis @xmath4 , the matrix representations of some useful single - qubit gates are given by x_= e^-ix ,   z_= e^-iz ,   h = (    cc 1 & 1 + 1 & -1    ) , where @xmath5 are used to represent the pauli operators i = (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & 1    ) , & & x = (    cc 0 & 1 + 1 & 0    ) , + y = (    cc 0 & -i + i & 0    ) , & & z = (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & -1    ) .",

    "instead , we focus on features of the 1wqc that differ from the tqc model .    the 1wqc is based on an input state known as the _ cluster state _ @xcite .",
    "the cluster state consists of a two - dimensional square lattice of qubits . to simulate a computation of @xmath83 qubits with logical depth @xmath84 , the lattice is chosen to be of size @xmath85 .",
    "one way of defining the cluster state is as the result of a two - stage preparation procedure : ( @xmath46 ) prepare all lattice sites in the state @xmath86 , and ( @xmath87 ) apply @xmath6 between each pair of qubits that are adjacent in the lattice . since the @xmath6 operations all commute , it does not matter in what order they are applied .",
    "note that this prescription is merely a convenient way of defining the cluster state , and there is no need to actually prepare it by following these steps .",
    "the cluster states naturally generalize to _ graph states _ , for which an arbitrary graph defines the adjacency relation @xcite .",
    "we will use a feature of any graph state called the _ deletion principle_. when one of the qubits is measured in the computational basis , the unmeasured qubits will be left in a different graph state ( up to known pauli errors ) corresponding to the graph obtained by deleting the measured qubit from the original graph . in the 1wqc model ,",
    "once the cluster state is prepared , an _ arbitrary _ circuit @xmath42 can be simulated using only single - qubit measurements .",
    "the first step is to `` imprint '' the circuit @xmath42 onto the cluster state by deleting qubits from the lattice to obtain some graph state that depends on @xmath42 . roughly speaking ,",
    "this graph consists of horizontal lines of vertices , each line corresponding to a qubit in @xmath42 , and vertical edges connecting neighboring lines corresponding to interactions between the simulated qubits .",
    "the qubits in the graph are then measured from the left to the right .",
    "each measurement propagates quantum information from the measured qubit to its unmeasured right neighbor . in general ,",
    "the measurement basis will depend on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "various regions of the graph simulate subcircuits .",
    "qubits entering a region from the left boundary carry the input state of the circuit element , and qubits exiting at the right boundary carry the output .",
    "when composing element - wise simulation in the 1wqc model , the output registers of one region have to match the input registers of the next region . a schematic diagram for a computation in the 1wqc model",
    "is given in fig .  1 .",
    "simulation of a circuit using the 1wqc is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the precise protocols and their verification are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "interpretations in terms of valence bond solids @xcite and teleportation @xcite have been reported recently . in this paper ,",
    "the derivation is based on a different underlying principle and the schemes are significantly simpler than those discussed in  @xcite .",
    "circuit representations of a computation in the 1wqc model turn out to be rather unwieldy .",
    "instead , we prefer to use a more concise `` substrate representation '' in which we label each vertex in the graph representing the cluster with the measurement to be performed .",
    "the measurement bases may depend on previous measurement outcomes , and this dependency should be indicated in the labeling . note that the interdependence of the measurement outcomes and measurement bases specifies a partial order in which the qubits must be measured .",
    "an example of the substrate representation is  ( [ eq:1bitsub ] ) , in , which simulates the circuit in  ( [ eq : circuiteg ] ) .",
    "the substrate representation for simulating a certain circuit often visually resembles the simulated circuit ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : circuiteg ] ) ) .",
    "one can identify the different physical qubits that carry the propagating quantum state at different times with propagation of quantum information in time , and the various regions of the graph state corresponding to different quantum gates with the action of those gates themselves .",
    "all the measurement - based models of quantum computation share the common feature that measurements are not performed solely on the qubits storing the data .",
    "the reason is that doing so would destroy the coherence essential to quantum computation . instead",
    ", ancilla qubits are prepared , and then measurements are used to interact the data with the ancilla . by choosing the measurements and initial states of the ancilla carefully , we can ensure that coherence is preserved .",
    "even more remarkably , with suitable choices of ancilla and measurements , it is possible to effect a universal set of quantum gates .    in this section ,",
    "we introduce two circuits that offer perhaps the simplest example of these principles in action , the one - bit teleportation circuits introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we will show how the one - bit teleportation circuits can be used to derive simulation circuits for a universal set of quantum gates .",

    "in contrast , no interactions are used in the 1wqc model after the initial preparation of the cluster state . in some sense ,",
    "all interactions are built into the initial state before the computation begins .",

    "in contrast , a tqc simulation has a one - to - one correspondence with @xmath42 .",
    "these differences suggest a strategy to derive 1wqc - like schemes using the principles of the tqc model : every gate is performed by simulation circuits based on teleportation or one - bit teleportation ( such as , , , , and ) .",
    "suppose the goal is to simulate a circuit @xmath42 with @xmath83 qubits and @xmath84 time steps .    1 .",
    "each gate in @xmath42 will be simulated by circuits like , , and .",
    "furthermore , in each time step , identity gates will be explicitly simulated on qubits that are not being acted on .",
    "thus , each qubit will be `` teleported '' in each step . matching the output of one gate simulation to the input of the next , we obtain a circuit @xmath47 that `` teleports '' each of the @xmath83 qubits @xmath84 times , with the desired gates performed along the way .",
    "@xmath47 contains initial @xmath88 states , one- or two - qubit gates , and single - qubit measurements .",
    "note that in this circuit we do not interpret a two - qubit gate followed by a single - qubit measurement as an incomplete two - qubit measurement , as we did in the tqc .",
    "the reason is that in the next step we will build the two - qubit gates into the initial state , leading to an equivalent circuit containing only single - qubit measurements . 2 .",
    "to build interactions into the initial state , we apply standard circuit identities to rewrite @xmath47 so that all two - qubit gates occur before the @xmath42-dependent single - qubit gates , followed by single - qubit measurements . the circuits used to simulate each gate",

    "we can thus interpret @xmath171 as starting from a @xmath42-dependent initial state @xmath172 , followed by single - qubit measurements .",
    "we will see that @xmath172 is like the circuit - dependent graph state in the original 1wqc scheme .",
    "schemes derived in this way will be called 1wqc@xmath173 schemes , with @xmath174 standing for the underlying principle of teleportation , and @xmath175 for an initial graph state .",
    "we want to modify the 1wqc@xmath173 schemes to start with a fixed , universal initial state analogous to the cluster state .",
    "the idea is to find a circuit that simulates a two - qubit gate or the identity gate depending on the choices of the single - qubit measurements .",
    "in other words , the interactions built into the initial state are `` undoable , '' in the sense that they may be optionally removed by some later single - qubit measurement .",
    "the desired universal initial state simply has an undoable interaction built in wherever the interaction may occur .",
    "we call the resulting model 1wqc@xmath176",
    ".        the most general quantum circuit @xmath42 can be viewed as consisting of alternating steps of ( @xmath46 ) arbitrary single - qubit gates and ( @xmath87 ) optional _ nearest - neighbor _ @xmath6 gates ( because @xmath29 and @xmath6 can be composed to make swap gates ) .",
    "we want gate - simulation circuits in which the interactions can be performed before the @xmath42-dependent single - qubit gates .",
    "thus , simulation circuits like and are preferred to ones like and .",
