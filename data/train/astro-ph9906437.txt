    "almost all known black hole candidates ( bhcs ) in our galaxy are x - ray transients . although the triggering for the x - ray outbursts is not fully understood , models invoking accretion disk instability seem to provide an explanation . other important issues concerning",

    "339 is an x - ray transient ( markert etal .  1973 ;",

    "the 2@xmath010  kev x - ray flux is about 50 times the x - ray flux in the low state , and the photon index of the power law is @xmath6 . on one occasion mendez & van der klis ( 1997 )",
    "reported that the source was in a state intermediate between the low - hard and the high - soft state in which the 2@xmath010  kev x - ray flux is about a factor of 5 below the x - ray flux in the high state .",

    "the sequence of h@xmath10 and heii @xmath174686 line profiles from the 1998 april observations are shown in figure  6 . the presence of a double - peak in each profile is not as obvious as it appears in the summed spectra .",
    "however , the trace of two peaks can still be easily seen .",
    "the relative prominence of the two peaks varies from one spectrum to another .",
    "as changes of the relative contribution of the two peaks have also been observed in other bhcs , e.g.  gro j1665@xmath040 , when they were in a high - soft state ( see soria , wu & hunstead 1999 ) , this may imply that similar activities are occurring in the accretion discs of these bhcs during that state .",
    "the profile of the h@xmath10 line is slightly skewed , with an apparently wider blue wing .",
    "we suspect that the skewness is caused by the presence of a weak broad component whose red wing is partially obscured / absorbed along the line of sight , an indication that opacity effects play a significant role in the high - soft state as well as in the low - hard state .",
    "a hint of a third peak superimposed on the blue wing is detected in some spectra , particularly in the last series of observations from april 28 .",
    "the profile sequence in figure  5 reveals that the strength of the emission above the continuum increased from the first to the second night , and then decreased , to the previous levels , from the second to the third night .",
    "the average ew of the h@xmath10 line was @xmath38   on april 28 , @xmath39   on april 29 , and @xmath40   on april 30 .",
    "we do not have photometric data from 1998 april , and we are therefore unable to determine whether the variations in the ew are a consequence of changes in the intensity of the continuum or of the emission line itself .",
    "the presence of two peaks in the heii @xmath174686 line is more obvious than in the case of h@xmath10 .",
    "they are clearly separated most of the time , and their separation is wider than that of the two peaks in the h@xmath10 line profile .",
    "the red and blue wings are more symmetric with respect to each other , in comparison with the wings of the h@xmath10 line .",
    "the average ew of heii @xmath174686 was @xmath41   on april 28 , @xmath42   on april 29 , and @xmath43   on april 30 .",
    "in figure 7 we show the profiles of the h@xmath10 and the heii @xmath174686 lines from the 1998 august observations .",
    "the corresponding peak locations are consistent with those found in april .",
    "the red peak is generally weaker than that observed in 1998 april , while the blue peak seems to be stronger .",
    "the non - detection of lii @xmath176708 and of other stellar absorption lines above the noise level ( s / n @xmath44 ) suggests that the emission from the companion star gives a negligible contribution to the optical continuum .",
    "this is not surprising : in 1981 the system was observed at an optical brightness as low as @xmath45 mag ( hutchings , cowley & crampton 1981 ; ilovaisky & chevalier 1981 ) , which is approximately the brightness of a @xmath46 main sequence star at a distance of @xmath47 kpc ( zdziarski etal .",
    "1998 ) ; if that is the intrinsic brightness of the companion star , it would have contributed only @xmath48 of the optical flux detected in our observations ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the spectra are dominated by emission lines in both the low - hard and the high - soft states .",
    "we argue that these lines are emitted from the accretion disc and/or its corona and wind .",
    "thus , the accretion disc is present and active in both x - ray spectral states .",
    "the emission lines in the 1997 may spectra appear to have a round - topped profile , skewed towards the red .",
    "although we can not rule out the interpretation that the round - topped lines actually consist of two components , we do not see clearly resolved peaks in our data .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the round - topped lines are the consequences of an outflow , a dense wind from an inflated non - keplerian disk or an evaporating corona .",
    "if the outflowing matter is sufficiently dense to produce a large opacity , lines emitted from the accretion disc beneath can be masked .",
    "the lines will then be dominated by emission from the outflowing material instead of by emission from the accretion disc . as the kinematic velocity of the outflowing matter should be of the same order of magnitude as the local keplerian velocities",
    ", the widths of the lines from the outflowing material may not differ much from the widths of lines from the accretion disc .",
    "however , the lines will not show double - peaked profiles , and will instead appear to be round - topped or flat topped , depending on the outflow velocity and density profiles ( see chapter 14 in mihalas 1978 ) , similar to those of lines from windy massive stars .    the 1998 spectra show a strong optical continuum originated from an optically thick accretion disc . for a keplerian disc , the rotational velocity and the temperature increase radially inward .",
    "if the disc is only viscously heated at the middle layer of the disc , a temperature gradient will be set up , such that the temperature decreases from the central plane to the disc surface .",
    "this will result in a spectrum dominated by absorption lines ( see e.g.  la dous 1989 ) .",
    "however , if there is a temperature inversion near the disc surface  which may be caused by external irradiation  the spectrum will then be dominated by emission lines .",
    "the 1998 april spectra clearly show prominent emission lines with resolved double - peaks superimposed on a strong continuum .",
    "this implies that the accretion disc is irradiatively heated .",
    "the increase in the velocity separation with the ionisation state of the accreting matter is strong evidence that the disc is irradiated by a central source , as the higher excitation lines originate from the inner regions , where the keplerian velocities are larger and the temperature higher due to the smaller distance from the irradiation source . for a discussion on irradiation heating of accretion disks , see e.g. dubus etal .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the velocity separation of the h@xmath10 peaks in the high - soft state is smaller than the velocity separation obtained by a two - gaussian fit to the line profiles obtained in the low - hard state ( see also smith etal .  1999 ) .",
    "it is , however , roughly the same as the velocity separation of the h@xmath20 line observed in the same epoch . as the velocity separation of the peaks in the low - hard state",
    "is not well - defined , we can not draw any firm conclusions from the comparison .",
    "however , we have found that the velocity separation of the peaks in the h@xmath10 line in the high - soft state is a factor of two smaller than that observed in gro j1655@xmath040 in the same x - ray spectral state ( soria , wu & hunstead 1999 ) . the latter is a high orbital inclination system ( @xmath50 , e.g.  van der hooft etal .",
    "if the masses of the black holes in 339 and gro j1655@xmath040 are similar , say 710m@xmath9 , the smaller velocity separation for 339 implies that either the accretion disc in 339 is larger or the orbital inclination of 339 is lower . as the companion star of 339 is not visible during its off state ( callanan etal .",
    "1992 ) , it is likely to be a low mass star , less massive than the companion star in gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "this leads us to propose that 339 is a system with a low orbital inclination .",
    "a low orbital inclination for 339 is in fact consistent with the null detection of the orbital modulation in our 1997/1998 spectroscopic data .",
    "it is also supported by the fact that the radio spectrum of 339 is relatively flat ( fender etal .",
    "1997 ) , unlike the steep spectra expected from a superluminal synchrotron jet source .",
    "although a 14.8-h periodicity was detected when 339 was observed in an off state ( callanan etal .",
    "1992 ) , both our 1997/1998 spectroscopic data and our 1998/1999 photometric data ( soria , wu & johnston 1999a , b ) do not show any obvious periodicities . our photometric observations in 1998 august show variations in the brightness of the source similar to the flaring activities seen in a previous observation by corbet etal .",
    "( 1987 ) . on august 20 its brightness varied between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "while on august 23 the source brightened up from @xmath53 at the beginning of the night to a maximum of @xmath54 5 hours later , then started to decline again .",
    "further photometric observations during the off state are required to verify if 339 has a 14.8-h orbital period .",
    "if we accept the argument that 339 has a low orbital inclination , the 14.8-h periodicity detected by callanan etal .",
    "( 1992 ) may perhaps also be due to the precession of a weak accretion disc and/or its associated jet .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations of the bhc binary 339 during its low - hard and high - soft states .",
    "our data show that the optical spectra in the low - hard state are characterised by emission lines with slightly asymmetric , round - topped profiles ; on the other hand , the spectra in the high - soft state show emission lines with unambiguously resolved doubled - peaked profiles .",
    "we do not see obvious stellar absorption lines : this implies that the optical spectrum in both x - ray spectral states is dominated by emission from accreting matter around the black hole .",
    "the round - topped lines seen in the low - hard state are probably formed in opaque matter outflowing from the central black hole and/or the accretion disc .",
    "the double - peaked lines seen in the high - soft state , however , indicate the presence of a bright , active accretion disc .",
    "the trend of increasing velocity separation with line ionisation supports the model of an accretion disc irradiatively heated by soft x - rays from a central source .",
    "we do not see 14.8-h modulations in our spectroscopic data and we are therefore unable to verify the 14.8-h orbital period .",
    "the null detection of the 14.8-h periodicity and of stellar absorption lines , together with the relatively small velocity separation of the line peaks , lead us to believe that 339 is low - mass system with a low orbital inclination .",

    "<S> we carried out spectroscopic observations of the candidate black hole binary 339 during its low - hard and high - soft x - ray states . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the spectrum is dominated by emission lines of neutral elements with asymmetric , round - topped profiles in the low - hard state . in the high - soft state , however , the emission lines from both neutral and ionised elements have unambiguously resolved double - peaked profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of double - peaked emission lines in the high - soft state with a larger peak separation for higher - ionisation lines indicates the presence of an irradiatively - heated accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the round - topped lines in the low - hard state is probably due to a dense matter outflow from an inflated non - keplerian accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not show velocity modulations of the line centres due to the orbital motion of the compact object , neither do the line base - widths show substantial variations in each observational epoch . </S>",
    "<S> there are no detectable absorption lines from the companion star . </S>",
    "<S> all these features are consistent with those of a system with a low - mass companion star and low orbital inclination .    </S>",
