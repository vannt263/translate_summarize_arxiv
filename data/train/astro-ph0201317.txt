    "[ se29:intro ]    a rich chemical and physical interplay exists between gas and grains in which molecules are formed on grains , creating ice mantles that are preserved in environments ranging from quiescent dense molecular clouds to envelopes and disks around protostars .",
    "various processes , among which are bombardment by cosmic rays , ultraviolet irradiation , heating , and shocks , can physically or chemically alter the icy mantles , or return molecules into the gas phase ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a study of the chemical evolution of dense clouds to planet forming disks would ideally involve observations of molecular gas and ices in a range of environments , from quiescent clouds to disk dominated protostars . the most pristine , initial conditions are presumably well sampled by field stars behind clouds tracing quiescent molecular cloud material ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "lines of sight to protostars are more difficult to characterize , however , since they may trace quiescent foreground material , in addition to the gas and ices in their envelopes and disks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus crucial to characterize the line of sight conditions in order to locate the ices and derive physical conditions and eventually the evolution of the molecular gas and solid state in the interstellar medium .    in this paper , we study the line of sight of the class i protostar elias 29 in the @xmath0 oph molecular cloud , using ( sub)millimeter single dish and interferometer gas phase observations .",
    "this object is one of the most luminous protostars ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) in the nearby @xmath0 oph complex ( @xmath9 pc ; @xcite ) , yet little is known about its nature and line of sight conditions .",
    "abundant ice has been detected in its direction @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of ice band profiles indicates that the ices are not strongly thermally processed ( i.e. the ices are not crystallized or segregated ) , despite the presence of abundant warm molecular gas toward the object @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with high mass , luminous ( @xmath10 ) protostars , where significant thermal processing of the ices accompanies the presence of abundant warm molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the result obtained for elias 29 can only be understood once the location of the ices and the physical conditions of the various gas components are known .",
    "therefore , in this paper we try to identify any foreground material , the presence of a circumstellar envelope as well as the presence and orientation of a circumstellar disk , and the column density of each component .",
    "we will then address the question where the ices are located , and what their relation is to the young star .",
    "this study will , as a consequence , reveal important information on the nature and evolutionary stage of elias 29 , which has many interesting and unique properties @xcite .",
    "details of the single dish and interferometer observations are presented in  2 , and the maps and spectra are decomposed and interpreted in  3 .",
    "the physical conditions are determined for the different components along the line of sight , among which are two foreground clouds (  4.1 ) , a remnant envelope and face - on disk (  4.2 ) , as well as a dense ridge from which elias 29 probably formed (  4.3 ) .",
    "the gas phase conditions and abundances are linked to the ice observations in  4.4 .",
    "the depletion of gas phase species is compared to young class 0 objects and quiescent clouds in  4.5 .",
    "the results are summarized in  5 .",
    "single dish and interferometer millimeter wave spectral line and continuum observations were made toward the infrared position of elias 29 ( @xmath11 = 16@xmath1227@xmath1309@xmath14.5 , @xmath15 = @xmath1637@xmath1718@xmath1 ; j2000 ) .",
    "rotational lines of co , @xmath2 , cs , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and isotopes were selected in the 70 - 400 ghz spectral range based on their sensitivity to column density , temperature , and density @xcite .",

    "the nrao-12 m data retrieved from the telescope are on a @xmath23 scale , and the cso and jcmt data in @xmath24 . to convert to the main beam brightness temperature ( @xmath25 ) , we divide by the beam efficiencies :    @xmath26    this corrects for losses in the beam side lobes . for the jcmt and cso",

    "the beam efficiencies applied to our data are summarized in table  [ t : eta ] . for the cso telescope , @xmath27 and the main beam size ( table  [ t : sdish ] ) were determined by observing mars during observing runs in march 1999 and january 2001 . for the nrao-12 m , we used the theoretical values of @xmath28 from the ruze equation , increased by a small factor ( @xmath29 ) , needed to reproduce the experimental values @xcite . as a check",
    ", we determined @xmath28 from our observation of jupiter , yielding @xmath30=0.80 at 145 ghz , in excellent agreement with the assumed value .",
    "for the jcmt , the efficiency factors are taken from regularly measured values reported on the internet .    the calibration accuracy between different observing runs is not expected to be better than 25% ( e.g. @xcite ) . as a check on the calibration accuracy , we observed the very bright nearby source iras 162932422 during our jcmt and cso runs .",
    "we find that line intensities , observed with the same telescope during the night and in separate observing runs , indeed scatter with 20 - 30% variations around the mean .",
    "similar differences are found when comparing jcmt observations to the standard spectra available at the jcmt internet page . in this paper , we will assume an uncertainty of 25% in the line intensity , unless noted otherwise .",

    "understanding the circumstellar environment of elias  29 requires the combination of several pieces of crucial information : the single - dish @xmath2  32 map and 1.3  mm dust - continuum distribution ( fig .  [ f : hcop ] ) , the spatially resolved emission in @xmath47co 10 and @xmath2  10 observed by ovro ( fig .",

    "the ovro images and channel maps ( figs .",
    "[ f : ovromap ] and  [ f : ovrochan ] ) show that part of the @xmath47co and @xmath2  emission is centered on elias  29 , while a significant fraction follows the crest of the ridge , @xmath81@xmath82 offset to the west / southwest .",
    "this shows that multiple components are present in the immediate vicinity of elias  29 ( i.e. , within a typical single - dish beam ) , in addition to the multiple velocity components along the line of sight (  4.1 ) . the velocity coincidence between the ridge and elias  29 further supports that the star formed from the ridge .",
    "the most important clues about the nature of elias  29 are offered by the infrared sed . because of the large beam with which these measurements were taken (  2 ) , the sed reflects not only elias  29 but also many of the other components identified above .",
    "our ability to derive accurate parameters for each component therefore proved essential in helping to understand the nature of elias  29 .",
    "the sed ( fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) is remarkably flat between 10 and 200 @xmath79 m . at 10 @xmath79 m",
    "there is a prominent silicate absorption band , and at 5 @xmath79 m the sed shows a broad peak on top of which a number of sharp ice absorption features are present .",
    "below 2 @xmath79 m the emission drops off sharply .",
    "flat protostellar seds are generally explained by a circumstellar disk .",
    "compared to other circumstellar material distributions , a disk , especially a flared one , has the surface - area vs. temperature distribution required to create a flat sed .    for our analysis , we adopt the flared disk model of @xcite with the parameters listed in table  [ t : model ] .",
    "the flatness of the sed is explained in this model by a superheated surface layer .",
    "the continuum emission of the disk is modeled using the radiative transfer part of the monte - carlo code of @xcite ; this part of the code simply calculates the expected continuum emission from a given distribution of density and temperature by building up a grid of points on the sky , for each of which the radiative transfer is solved along straight lines . the resulting grid is then convolved with the appropriate beam sizes . because of the large number of parameters involved , their values should be considered as representative only .",
    "we believe that the general characteristics of the model are firmly established , however . the flatness of the sed over a large wavelength range ( 4 - 100 @xmath20 ; fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) limits the inclination of the system to @xmath83 ( @xmath84 being edge - on ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a low inclination can not explain the deep ice and silicate absorption features that are visible in the observed sed ; these must originate in the envelope and foreground clouds .",

    ". a fully face on orientation is however not likely , given the presence of low surface brightness scattered k band light out to distances of 15@xmath1 ( 2400 au ) from the central object ( zinnecker , perrier , & chelli 1988 ) .",
    "this light presumably traces the outflow lobes , adjacent to the remnant envelope and the outer edges of the disk .",
    "the emission is extended along the southwest / northeast direction , perpendicular to the high velocity outflowing gas ( c. ceccarelli et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , with an axis ratio compatible with an inclination of roughly @xmath86 .",
    "flattening on a similar scale is observed in the ovro images and in the 1.3 mm continuum iram-30 m single dish map .",
    "the flux between 20 and 40 @xmath79 m indicates a temperature scaled upward by a factor of 2.25 with respect to the values used by @xcite .",
    "the central star is therefore approximately 50 times brighter than their standard model , presumably because it has a higher mass ( using the scaling relation @xmath87 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disk midplane dominates the emission beyond 25 @xmath79 m , and the shape of the sed at these wavelengths limits the disk radius to @xmath5 500 au .",
    "the warmer surface layer dominates the shorter wavelengths and generate a silicate _ emission _",

    "the disk model can explain only @xmath520% of the emission maximum around 5 @xmath79 m .",
    "indeed , speckle observations of elias 29 reveal the presence of a @xmath5400 au radius thermally emitting region ( @xmath88 a few 100 k ; i.e. not scattered light ) responsible for @xmath520% of the m band flux @xcite , which , in our model , is explained by the warm disk surface layer .",
    "the observed remaining 80% of the m band emission originates from hot dust within a few au from the central object .",
    "perhaps this is a puffed up hot rim at the inner disk edge , just outside the region where dust has evaporated ( @xmath89 k ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the innermost , hottest , part of the rim may be related to the 0.25 au radius structure found in lunar occultation k band observations @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to fit the inner regions and stellar photosphere with that level of detail , but instead use an 800  k blackbody with an effective radius of 1.4  au to explain the remaining 80% of m band emission , and roughly the shape of the sed at shorter wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) .",
    "the disk alone is also insufficient to explain the emission beyond @xmath90 @xmath79 m .",
    "the single - dish line emission clearly reveals the presence of appreciable columns of material at 2.7 and 3.8 km  s@xmath66 (  4.1 ) .",
    "when filling the iso beam with these columns , the emission between 55 and 180 @xmath79 m can be fit at a dust temperature of 19  k. this material provides sufficient opacity in the 10 @xmath20  silicate band to turn the disk s emission feature into the observed absorption feature .",
    "the opacity shortward of 2 @xmath79 m is also sufficient to explain the observed steep drop in emission at short wavelengths .",
    "this strongly suggests that a large fraction of the 2.7 and 3.8 km  s@xmath66 material is located in front of elias  29 , as was found from the absorption in the @xmath43  emission lines as well (  4.1 ) .",
    "while the model of disk and foreground clouds fits the sed well , it produces a 1.3 mm continuum emission that is a factor of 3 larger than observed with the iram-30 m telescope , at large distances from the object ( @xmath91 mjy ; fig .  [ f:13mmprof ] ) .",
    "this may result directly from the adopted dual - beam mapping procedure of the iram-30 m observations , which filters out emission on the chopping scale @xcite .",
    "additionally , the model of disk and foreground predicts a source size at 1.3  mm that is too small ( fig .",
    "[ f:13mmprof ] ) .",
    "the observed profile indicates that the source extends to a radius of at least 3800  au ( 25 ) , much larger than is realistic for a circumstellar disk .",
    "instead , it suggests that elias  29 and its disk are embedded in a residual cloud condensation from which the system formed . for lack of stronger constraints",
    ", we model this envelope ( as we will refer to this condensation from now on ) with the inside - out collapse model of @xcite .",
    "earlier work ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) has shown that this model provides an adequate description of the density and temperature of envelopes around ysos .",
    "the two parameters of this model are the sound speed and the time since the collapse started , for which we take , rather arbitrarily , 0.13 @xmath21  and @xmath92 yr respectively .",
    "this gives an envelope mass of 0.12 @xmath93 and a radius of the ` collapse expansion wave ' of 6000 au .",
    "additional parameters are listed in table  [ t : model ] .",
    "this model , combined with the disk , produces a radial emission profile that fits the measured 1.3  mm continuum distribution much better than the disk alone ( fig .",
    "[ f:13mmprof ] ) .",
    "the sed below @xmath94",
    "@xmath20  is remarkably little affected by the envelope , even though with 0.12  m@xmath95 it is much more massive than the disk ( 0.012  m@xmath95 ; table  [ t : model ] ) .",
    "the material in the disk , of course , has a somewhat higher temperature range than the envelope ( 20033 k vs. 4417 k , respectively ) , yielding significantly more infrared flux .",
    "the envelope produces only a small amount of additional absorption in the 10 @xmath79 m silicate band .    the parameters for the disk and envelope derived above ( table  [ t : model ] ) maximize the contribution to the sed from the disk and minimize the mass of the envelope .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence that favor , but not proof , this maximum disk model above models with smaller disks .",
    "first , as for sources with directly detected disks @xcite , the disk contributes about half of the 1.3 mm continuum flux ( @xmath5 120 mjy/15  beam ; foreground subtracted ) .",
    "indeed , assuming that the weak 3 mm continuum flux within the small ovro beam (  2.2 ) orginates from the disk , then the expected 1.3 mm disk flux would be half the single dish flux ( @xmath35[1.3 mm]=49@xmath3614 mjy , taking spectral index 2.5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the abovementioned 400 au radius structure , emitting thermally at 5 @xmath20 , may well be the surface of a large , warm disk . and third",
    ", a large face - on flared disk is the simplest way to explain the observed flat infrared sed .",
    "nevertheless , the evidence for a large 500 au radius disk is not conclusive and therefore we also try to maximize the envelope s contribution in our model .",
    "we find that its mass can be as large as 0.33 @xmath93 , while the corresponding disk mass needs to be reduced to 0.002 m@xmath95 , in part by reducing the disk s radius to 30 au to preferentially decrease the amount of cool material .",
    "the disk s temperature scaling does not change appreciably with respect to that used before .",
    "it must be emphasized that in this minimum disk scenario , the flatness of the infrared sed is the result of a `` disk / envelope conspiracy '' , rather than a direct consequence of the flared disk s properties .",
    "although the disk and envelope masses are different from those listed in table  [ t : model ] , they are comparable to within the same order of magnitude and this level of uncertainty does not affect our conclusions . in the remainder of this section we will adopt the slightly preferred values from table  [ t : model ] , i.e. the maximum disk case .",
    "we use the accelerated monte - carlo method of @xcite to calculate the molecular excitation and the resulting line emission in the various beams , including a realistic sampling of spatial scales recovered by the interferometer observations . because the disk and envelope exhibit a range of densities and temperatures , we can not use the much simpler escape probability approach here .",
    "we calculate the line intensities for three different cases ( table  [ t : predict ] ) : for the disk alone , for the envelope alone , and for the combination of disk+envelope taking into account optical depth effects .",
    "the predicted line intensities are meant to be illustrative only .",
    "the general trends are robust , however . adopting ` fiducial ' molecular abundances derived for the two foreground clouds ( table  [ t : phys ] ) , we find that the emission of c@xmath49o observed with ovro is overestimated by at least a factor of 5 by the disk+envelope model .",
    "this can be accounted for by adopting a depletion factor of 5 - 10 for co in the disk .",
    "a large co depletion factor has been seen in many other disks as well @xcite . from the single - dish lines",
    "it can also be concluded , in particular from cs 7 - 6 , that a significant depletion in the disk is needed ( table  [ t : phys ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the higher excitation transitions are dominated by the disk+envelope , while the lower excitation lines can only be partially explained by this model",
    ". a fair fraction of these lines must therefore originate in the ridge .",
    "as mentioned above , elias  29 appears to be embedded in a ridge traced by the 1.3  mm continuum and @xmath2  3 - 2 line emission , but slightly offset from the crest of the ridge .",
    "how much of the line emission measured in the single - dish and interferometer beams at 5.0 km  s@xmath66 can be attributed to the elias  29 disk+envelope system , and how much originates in this dense ridge ?",
    "this question is relevant , because it addresses the issue of how much additional column density resides in the ridge that can harbor the ice - absorption bands .",
    "when we subtract the predicted emission of elias  29 s disk and envelope from the single - dish line fluxes at 5.0 km  s@xmath66 of table  [ t : decomp ] , we can use the ratios of the remaining intensities to roughly constrain the conditions in the ridge .",
    "[ f : phys]c shows the results for the c@xmath49o 1 - 0/3 - 2 and @xmath2  1 - 0/3 - 2 lines .",
    "the density is constrained at @xmath96 @xmath97 , significantly higher than that of the foreground clouds , while the temperature is found to be similarly low at @xmath98  k. these parameters are consistent with the appearance of the ridge in the 1.3  mm and @xmath2  3 - 2 maps ( cold and dense ) .",
    "the corresponding column density along the ridge is @xmath99 @xmath77 , comparable to that of the largest column density foreground cloud at 3.8 km  s@xmath66 .",
    "elias  29 is offset from the maximum column density in the ridge , however , and the pencil beam traced in the infrared absorption features may contain a significantly smaller column density .",
    "the fact that the foreground clouds and , to a lesser extent , the envelope can already fit the 10 @xmath79 m absorption would suggest that the ridge does not contribute significantly .",
    "this conclusion does not change if we assume the higher envelope mass of 0.3 @xmath93 .",
    "we have identified four regions of significant column density in the line of sight of elias 29 : the 2.7 and 3.8 @xmath21  foreground clouds , the dense ridge , and the envelope .",
    "all of these are cold environments , in which icy mantles can exist , and together they must account for the rich spectrum of ices seen with the iso satellite @xcite .",
    "their relative contribution to the visual extinction and ice bands depends on which fraction of the column is actually in front of elias 29 .",
    "the 2.7 and 3.8 @xmath21  clouds are likely in front (  4.1 ) with columns corresponding to visual extinctions @xmath100=2.9 and 8.2 .",
    "the visual extinction of the dense ridge , @xmath1015.9 , is an upper limit beause the ridge is somewhat displaced from elias 29 .",
    "for the envelope , @xmath102 is 2.5 magn . for the minimum , and 6 magn . for the maximum envelope case .",
    "these are upper limits because the system is seen at low inclination and much of the envelope material is likely not in front of elias 29 .",
    "the extinction from either ridge or envelope is however not negligible , given the absorption seen at 5.0 @xmath21  in the co 6 - 5 emission line ( fig .",
    "[ f : sdish ] ) .",
    "finally , extinction by the circumstellar disk is not significant due to its low inclination .",
    "there is observational evidence that ices in molecular clouds form only above a certain threshold extinction value ( @xmath103 ; @xcite ) , due to photodesorption at the cloud edges @xcite . above @xmath103 ,",
    "the ice abundances grow linearly with @xmath102 .",
    "the visual extinction can thus , in principle , be used as an indicator for h@xmath7o ice growth and destructions mechanisms .",
    "unfortunately , the usefulness of this relation is limited by the uncertainty in @xmath103 . measurements of a variety of sight - lines in @xmath0 oph indicate @xmath103=12 @xcite , but @xmath104 toward ob stars tracing ices in foreground clouds only @xcite .",
    "the @xmath102 values used to calibrate the aforementioned relation are highly uncertain as well @xcite . while our emission line method has its own uncertainties ( beam dilution , disk / envelope ratio ) , the generally used h ",
    "k color method may be uncertain by a factor of 2 , for example due to an unknown color of the intrinsic light source .",
    "indeed , for elias 29 a much lower @xmath105 was found from j ",
    "h color ( th.p .",
    "greene , priv .",
    "comm . ) , compared to the h ",
    "k color ( @xmath106 ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , using the relation in @xcite , and assuming that the threshold extinction for h@xmath7o formation ( @xmath103=12 ) applies only once for all clouds combined , we find that the total @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath108 @xmath109 , which is @xmath5030% of the observed ice column density @xcite . in this picture , the observed ice column is thus much higher than that expected from the total visual extinction along the line of sight . given the abovementioned uncertainties in the ice column versus @xmath102 and @xmath103 relation , the most reliable conclusion that can be drawn from this is that h@xmath7o ice sublimation does not play an important role in the elias 29 line of sight .    from a different perspective",
    ", the low temperature of the clouds along the line of sight ( table  [ t : phys ] ) indicates that indeed no sublimation or other forms of thermal processing ( e.g. crystallization ) of polar , h@xmath7o  rich ices can take place .",
    "a similar conclusion was previously drawn from the ( low ) far infrared color index , which is found to be a good indicator of thermal processing of ices @xcite .",
    "even the temperature of the warmest absorbing component , the inner part of the envelope ( @xmath545 k ) , is less than the h@xmath7o crystallization ( @xmath110 k ) and sublimation temperatures ( @xmath111 k ) .",
    "this explains the observed lack of crystallization signatures in the absorption band profiles of solid h@xmath7o and co@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thermal processing must have played a role for apolar , co  rich ices toward elias 29 , however .",
    "the solid co / h@xmath7o ratio is 5% , which is a factor of five less than in several other lines of sight within the @xmath0 oph cloud @xcite .",
    "we find that elias 29 has heated its envelope sufficiently ( 1744 k ;  4.2 ) to evaporate co  rich ices ( @xmath1121520 k ; @xcite ) , but preserve h@xmath7o  rich ices .",
    "the envelope , however , harbors only a small fraction of the ices , and it is unlikely that this 38 @xmath113 object can heat ices located beyond the envelope , such as the dense ridge and the two foreground clouds .",
    "nevertheless , the temperatures of the gas and dust in the quiescent foreground clouds are similar to , or slightly higher ( table  [ t : phys ] ) than the sublimation temperature of apolar ices . several known luminous b stars and the sco ob2 association play an important role in heating the dust in the @xmath0 oph cloud @xcite . the differences of the solid co / h@xmath7o ratio within @xmath0 oph",
    "may thus be explained by the location of the ices with respect to these luminous heating sources .",
    "bright external heating sources are absent in the taurus molecular cloud , and indeed the co / h@xmath7o ratios are significantly larger in that cloud @xcite .",
    "the depletion factor of co ( defined as solid/[gas+solid ] ) amounts to a few percent , assuming the ices are present in several of the clouds toward elias 29 ( using @xmath74[co - ice]=@xmath114 @xmath109 ; @xcite ) .",
    "direct measurements of solid co yield larger depletion factors in the quiescent taurus molecular cloud ( 8 - 40% ; @xcite ) .",

    "we will compare gas phase abundances of other molecules toward elias 29 with those of class 0 sources , as well as the well studied dense cloud tmc  1 ( table  [ t : phys ] ) .",
    "even when taking the uncertainty of gas phase abundances into account , we find that co , cs , @xmath18 , and possibly @xmath2  are an order of magnitude more depleted in the class 0 sources compared to the clouds in front of elias 29 .",
    "this can be ascribed to the much larger densities and low dust temperatures in the outer regions ( @xmath115 700 au ) of these class 0 objects , and thus shorter depletion times scales @xcite .",
    "depletion is much lower in the tmc  1 cloud compared to class 0 objects ( table  [ t : phys ] ) . in fact , the @xmath18  and @xmath19  abundances are an order of magnitude larger than toward elias 29 . whether these species are depleted toward elias 29 can not be answered directly , because the upper limit to the ice abundances are typically a few@xmath116 ( @xcite ; taking @xmath117 @xmath109 ) .",
    "this is four and two orders of magnitude larger than the gas phase @xmath19  and @xmath18  abundances respectively , and demonstrates that a direct determination of depletion factors by using infrared ice bands suffers from a lack of sensitivity . alternatively , the difference in gas phase @xmath19  and @xmath18  abundances between these clouds may have its origin in different chemical evolutionary states , such was found within the tmc 1 cloud itself for several carbon bearing species @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath18  abundances of several other quiescent and star forming cores ( 210@xmath118 ; @xcite ) are in much better agreement with elias 29 .    in some class 0 sources , the @xmath19  and @xmath18  abundances and temperatures are larger than in our comparison source ngc 1333 : iras 4 , possibly because they are more evolved @xcite .",
    "this warm gas originates from evaporated ices , that are enriched in hydrogenated molecules by grain surface reactions during the collapse of the cold envelope .",
    "shocks @xcite and thermal evaporation @xcite in the inner envelope have been proposed as ice desorption mechanisms , which can enhance the @xmath18  abundance at radii @xmath119 au by 2 orders of magnitude .",

    "boogert et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "emission from this gas is severely diluted in the large single dish milimeter wave beams , and thus difficult to detect .    finally , the @xmath2  abundance toward elias 29 is comparable to that found toward class 0 objects , but an order of magnitude lower compared to tmc 1 .",
    "the importance of depletion is more difficult to establish , because the @xmath2  abundance is highly dependent on local cosmic ray flux and electron density . even in the direction of elias 29",
    "the @xmath2  abundance varies dramatically .",

    "we stress however that the prominent appearance of the ridge in the @xmath2  3 - 2 map ( fig .",

    "these same foreground clouds are also the most likely repository of most of the ices seen along the line of sight ( @xmath122% ) .",
    "the low temperature of the foreground clouds explains the observed absence of crystallized ices , and the presence of large abundances of polar , h@xmath7o  rich ices , i.e. thermal processing did not play a major role for the ices toward elias 29 .",
    "the foreground cloud temperature ( 25@xmath3615 k ) could , however , be high enough to explain the low abundance of apolar , volatile co  rich ices , presumably due to the proximity of a number of luminous b type stars .",

    "<S> a ( sub-)millimeter line and continuum study of the class i protostar elias 29 in the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular cloud is presented , whose goals are to understand the nature of this source , and to locate the ices that are abundantly present along this line of sight . within 1560@xmath1 beams , </S>",
    "<S> several different components contribute to the line emission . </S>",
    "<S> two different foreground clouds are detected , an envelope / disk system and a dense ridge of @xmath2rich material . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two components are spatially separated in millimeter interferometer maps . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the envelope / disk system by using inside - out collapse and flared disk models . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is in a relatively face - on orientation ( @xmath3 ) , which explains many of the remarkable observational features of elias 29 , such as its flat sed , its brightness in the near infrared , the extended components found in speckle interferometry observations , and its high velocity molecular outflow . </S>",
    "<S> it can not account for the ices seen along the line of sight , however . </S>",
    "<S> a small fraction of the ices is present in a ( remnant ) envelope of mass 0.120.33 @xmath4 , but most of the ices ( @xmath570% ) are present in cool ( @xmath640 k ) quiescent foreground clouds . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the observed absence of thermally processed ices ( crystallized h@xmath7o ) toward elias 29 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the temperatures could be sufficiently high to account for the low abundance of apolar ( co , n@xmath7 , o@xmath7 ) ices . </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that it is crucial to obtain spectrally and spatially resolved information from single - dish and interferometric molecular gas observations in order to determine the nature of protostars and to interpret infrared iso satellite observations of ices and silicates along a pencil beam . </S>"
