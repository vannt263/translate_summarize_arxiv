    "every physicist knows the rule for combining several experimental results : @xmath1 where ` @xmath2 ' refers to the true value and @xmath3 stands for the individual data point ( the use of @xmath4 , instead of the usual @xmath5 , for the standard uncertainty reported by the experiments will become clear later ; similarly , the meaning of ` @xmath2 ' and of @xmath6 have not been well defined for the moment , as they will be better defined later ) .",
    "the above rule , hereafter called _ standard combination rule _",
    ", is based on some hypotheses which are worth recalling : all measurements refer to the same quantity ; _ ii ) _ the measurements are independent ; _ iii ) _ the probability distribution of @xmath7 around @xmath2 is described by a gaussian distribution with standard deviation given by @xmath8 .",
    "if one , or several , of these hypotheses are not satisfied , the result of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : media])([eq : sigma ] ) is questionable .",
    "now we are confronted with the problem that we are never absolutely sure if these hypotheses are true or not .",
    "if we were absolutely convinced that the hypotheses were correct , there would be no reason to hesitate to apply eqs .",
    "( [ eq : media])([eq : sigma ] ) , no matter how ` apparently incompatible ' the data points might appear .",
    "but we know by experience that unrecognized sources of systematic errors might affect the results , or that the uncertainty associated with the recognized sources might be underestimated ( but we also know that , often , this kind of uncertainty is prudently overstated  ) .    as is always the case in the domain of uncertainty , there is no ` objective ' method for handling this problem ; neither in deciding if the data are in mutual disagreement , nor in arriving at a universal solution for handling those cases which are judged to be troublesome .",
    "only good sense gained by experience can provide some guidance .",
    "therefore , all automatic ` prescriptions ' should be considered _",
    "cum grano salis_. for example , the usual method for checking the hypothesis that ` the data are compatible with each other ' is to make a @xmath9 test .",
    "the hypothesis is accepted if , generally speaking , the @xmath9 does not differ too much from the expected value . as a strict rule ,",
    "the @xmath9 test is not really logically grounded ( see e.g. section 1.8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) although it does ` often work ' , due to implicit hypotheses which are external to the standard @xmath9 test scheme ( see section 8.7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but which lead to mistaken conclusions when the unstated hypotheses are not reasonable ( see e.g. section 1.9 of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , i shall not attempt here to quantify the degree of suspicion .",
    "i shall assume a situation in which experienced physicists , faced with a set of results , tend to be uneasy about the mutual consistency of the picture that those data offer .",
    "as an example , let us consider the results of table  [ tab : results ] ,    .published results on re(@xmath0 ) ( values in units of @xmath10 ) .",
    "data points indicated by @xmath11 have been used for quantitative evaluations .",
    "owing to correlations between the 1988 and 1993 uncertainties of na31 , only the combined value published in 1993 is used protect@xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the problem of combining data which appear in mutual disagreement has been analysed from a probabilistic perspective . we have started from the usual hypotheses on which the well - known combination rule is based and we have seen that a possible solution can be based on a suitable modelling of the uncertainty on the standard deviation which describes the gaussian likelihood . the complete status of uncertainty on the true value resulting from the various pieces of information is quantified by a p.d.f .",
    "@xmath12 which , in our approach , does not have an a priori defined shape .",
    "this property allows one to obtain results which never conflict with the intuitive judgement of experienced physicists .",
    "the method described here also allows one to infer the ratio between the ` true ' standard deviation and the stated one , as a result of the mutual agreement of the data .",
    "the application of this method to cp violation results from k@xmath13 shows that the picture of a positive and sizeable value of re(@xmath0 ) survives a sceptical analysis .",
    "this conclusion also holds if one considers separately cern and fermilab results .",
    "as far as a number to summarize the result is concerned , the mass of probability is concentrated around @xmath14 , with a @xmath15 interval having a 68% probability of containing the true value . however the p.d.f .",
    "has a negative skewness that can not be ignored . as a consequence ,",
    "the expected value is slightly below the mode , at @xmath16 .",
    "we would like to re - state that what matters for uncertainty propagation is the expected value , together with the standard deviation ( @xmath17 ) , and not the mode , or the median , and the @xmath18 probability interval around either of them .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite [ fig : fabbrichesi ]    the 1999 experimental results on re(@xmath0 ) have indeed renewed the interest of theorists in the subject .",
    "the comparison of the combined result with recent @xcite and very new @xcite theoretical evaluations   is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fabbrichesi ] , an extension of the updated version  @xcite of fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the vertical bands quantify somehow the uncertainty stated by the theoretical teams .",
    "the dark - grey bars should have the meaning of 68% central probability bands , although sometimes they are given as standard deviation of a non - gaussian distribution .",
    "the grey bars are obtained using a procedure that the theorists call ` scanning ' ( see original papers ) , but which has no well - defined probabilistic meaning .",
    "since scanning produces very pessimistic uncertainty intervals , covering values of re(@xmath0 ) which the authors hardly believe , one should be careful about concluding from fig .",
    "[ fig : fabbrichesi ] that the experimental value of re(@xmath0 ) is well compatible with all the approaches used to evaluate it .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : confr_pdf ] ,    which shows the p.d.f.s of the munich and rome teams , alongside that obtained from the combined analysis of the experimental results , gives a better idea of the mutual compatibility , and of how to interpret the grey bars of fig .",
    "[ fig : fabbrichesi ] ( note , in particular the positive skewness of the theory curves and negative skewness of the experiment curve ) .",
    "the grey - dashed bar shows the upper 2@xmath19 tail of the result of a recent evaluation  @xcite which gives a very large negative value , having also a large uncertainty .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems that , given the well - known difficulties both in the experimental determination and in the theoretical evaluation , the overall picture is not dramatically worrying ( and therefore invoking new phenomenology seems premature ) .",
    "what it is _ practically _ certain is that direct cp violation in the neutral - kaon system is established .",
    "we are all looking forward to an accurate theoretical explanation of the effect .",
    "i am indebted to volker dose for having suggested to me the two - parameter extension of his work with wolfgang von der linden , for cross - checking some of the final formulae , and for comments on an initial version of the paper .",
    "i have benefited from discussions on the subject with pia astone and heinrich wahl , who also gave me helpful comments on the manuscript .",
