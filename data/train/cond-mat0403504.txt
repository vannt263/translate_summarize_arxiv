    "the study of noise induced transport by `` ratchets '' has attracted in recent years the attention of an increasing number of researchers due to the biological interest and also to its potential technological applications @xcite . since the pioneering works , besides the built - in ratchet - like bias and correlated fluctuations ( see for instance @xcite ) , different aspects have been studied , such as tilting @xcite and pulsating @xcite potentials , velocity inversions @xcite , etc .",
    "there are some relevant reviews @xcite where the biological and/or technological motivation for the study of ratchets can be found .",
    "recent studies on the role of non gaussian noises on some noise - induced phenomena like stochastic resonance , resonant trapping , and noise - induced transitions @xcite have shown the possibility of strong effects on the system s response .",
    "for instance , enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio in stochastic resonance , enhancement of the trapping current in resonant trapping , or shifts in the transition line for noise - induced transitions .",
    "these results motivate the interest in analyzing the effect of non gaussian noises on the behavior of brownian motors . here",
    "we analyze the effect of a particular class of colored non gaussian noise on the transport properties of brownian motors .",
    "such a noise source is based on the nonextensive statistics @xcite with a probability distribution that depends on @xmath0 , a parameter indicating the departure from gaussian behavior : for @xmath1 we have a gaussian distribution , and different non gaussian distributions for @xmath2 or @xmath3 .    some of the motivations for studying the effect of non gaussian noises are , in addition to its intrinsic interest within the realm of noise induced phenomena , the existence of experimental data indicating that for several biological problems fluctuations have a non gaussian character .",
    "examples are current measurements through voltage - sensitive ion channels in a cell membrane or experiments on the sensory system of rat skin @xcite . also , recent detailed studies on the source of fluctuations in different biological systems @xcite clearly show that , in such a context , noise sources in general are non gaussian . even though the previous arguments refer to biological aspects",
    "that are not directly related to ratchets , they strongly induce to think about the possible relevance of considering non gaussian noises in those biological situations where the ratchet transport mechanism can play a role .",
    "in addition , from the point of view of technological applications , the finding of new conditions that may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency of the devices is always desirable .",
    "we show here that , as a consequence of the non gaussian character of the driving noise and from two alternative points of view , we can find a kind of enhancement of the system s response .",
    "the first direct point of view , takes as free parameters those that could be controlled in the case of technological applications . in this case",
    "we find a remarkable increase of the current together with an enhancement of the motor efficiency when non - gaussian noises are considered ( showing an optimum for a given degree of departure from the @xmath4 gaussian behavior ) .",
    "moreover , when inertia is taken into account it is found that , again when departing from the gaussian case , there seems to be a remarkable increment in the mass separation capability of these devices .",
    "the second point of view is the more natural one when thinking of biological systems , as it considers the non - gaussian noise as a primary source . in this case",
    "we also find an enhancement of the current and efficiency due to departure from gaussian behavior , which occurs for low values of noise intensity .",
    "we begin presenting the general framework within which we will work , and the nature of the non gaussian noise .",
    "we continue discussing the first of the two points of view , and the results showing the enhancement we can find within it .",
    "after that we discuss the second point of view where we compare gaussian and non gaussian behaviors but adopting a constant width criterion , and discuss the results .",
    "finally we draw some general conclusions .",
    "we begin considering the general system @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the particle , @xmath7 the friction constant , @xmath8 the ratchet potential , @xmath9 is a constant `` load '' force , and @xmath10 the thermal noise satisfying @xmath11 .",
    "finally , @xmath12 is the time correlated forcing ( with zero mean ) that allows the rectification of the motion , keeping the system out of thermal equilibrium even for @xmath13 . for this type of ratchet model several different kind of time",
    "correlated forcing have been considered in the literature @xcite . in almost all studies",
    "authors have used gaussian noises .",
    "the few exceptions which considered non gaussian processes correspond mainly to the case of dichotomic noises @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic introduced by the non gaussian form of the forcing we consider here , is the appearance of arbitrary strong `` kicks '' with relatively high probability when compared , for example , with the gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) noise and , of course , with the dichotomic non gaussian process .",
    "we will consider the dynamics of @xmath12 as described by the following langevin equation @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17.\\ ] ] previous studies of such processes in connection with stochastic resonance problems @xcite and dynamical trapping @xcite , have shown that the non gaussian behavior of the noise leads to remarkable effects . for @xmath4 , the process @xmath18 coincides with the ou one ( with a correlation time equal to @xmath19 ) , while for @xmath20 it is a non gaussian process .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for @xmath21 the stationary probability distribution has a bounded support , with a cut - off at @xmath22^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , with a form given by @xmath23^\\frac{1}{1-q},\\ ] ] for @xmath24 and zero for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is a normalization constant ) . within the range @xmath27 , the probability distribution is given by @xmath28^\\frac{1}{1-q}\\ ] ] for @xmath29 , and decays as a power law ( slower than a gaussian distribution ) . finally ,",
    "for @xmath30 , this distribution can not be normalized .",
    "hence , we see that keeping @xmath31 constant , the width or dispersion of the distribution increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this means that , the higher the @xmath0 , the stronger the `` kicks '' that the particle will receive .",

    ", we were not able to find an analytical expression .",

    ", we briefly sketch some results about the correlation time @xmath37 .",
    "as commented above , both the second moment of @xmath42 and the correlation time of the process @xmath18 , diverge for @xmath43 .",
    "for the second moment , @xmath41 , we have the exact result shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) , while for the correlation time , @xmath37 , we have no analytical expression . however , in @xcite we have observed , numerically , the behavior of the correlation function @xmath44 in the stationary regime @xmath45 .",
    "we have found that the exponential decay of the correlations in the ou process is still valid for @xmath3 where we can write @xmath46 .",

    "2 we show , after simulation results for the correlation function @xmath51 , the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath0 , as well as the comparison with different approximations as follows    * @xmath52 * @xmath53 * @xmath54 \\ , \\tau}{(5 - 3q)},$ ]    where the third , ad hoc , approximation corresponds to the best fit to the numerical data within the range @xmath55 .",

    "as our first approach we will analyze the results for the current and efficiency as function of @xmath0 for constant values of @xmath31 and @xmath19 .",
    "these are the parameters that could be adequately controlled , for example , in a designed technological device .",
    "the analysis of the current and efficiency behavior for constant @xmath41 and @xmath37 , that will be discussed in the next section , could be considered an even more relevant item as @xmath41 and @xmath37 are parameters of the non gaussian noise when we think such noise as the `` primary source '' acting on the brownian particle .    in @xcite , essentially the same system described by eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) was analyzed for the case in which the time correlated forcing belongs to a general family of stochastic processes ( non gaussian in general ) called `` kangaroo processes '' . also in that work , and for the same kind of processes , a parameter called the `` flatness '' of the noise was defined as the ratio of the fourth moment to the square of the second moment of the stationary distribution .",
    "the dependence of the current on the flatness for the limit of small correlation time was discussed .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as defined in @xcite , the flatness of the stationary distribution of the process indicated by eq .",
    "( [ etapto ] ) is infinite for @xmath59 , since the fourth moment of the distribution diverges .",
    "as we will see , this corresponds to the parameter region where we observe a decay in the efficiency of the brownian motor .",
    "however , it has to be noted that the process here considered is not a `` kangaroo process '' .",
    "firstly , we analyze the overdamped regime setting @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for the ratchet potential in this case",
    "we will consider the same form as in @xcite ( with period @xmath62 ) @xmath63}{j_0(i\\alpha ) } - 1 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the bessel function , and @xmath65 .",
    "the form of @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "3.a . the integrand in eq.([v1dex ] )",
    "is the ratchet force ( @xmath67 ) appearing in eq.([xpto ] ) .",
    "( a ) and @xmath68 ( b ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of the current in normal situations ( that is , when there is no current  inversion\").,width=453 ]    we are interested on analyzing the dependence of the mean current @xmath69 and the efficiency @xmath70 on the different parameters , in particular , their dependence on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the ratio of the work ( per unit time ) done by the particle `` against '' the load force @xmath9 @xmath71 to the mean power injected to the system through the external forcing @xmath18 @xmath72 for the numerator we get @xmath73 , while for the denominator we obtain @xmath74 simulations show that the time average of @xmath75 is negligible in the latter equality ( it is always several orders of magnitude lower than @xmath76 ) and we may approximate the denominator as @xmath77^{-1}$ ] .",
    "interesting and complete discussions on the thermodynamics and energetics of ratchet systems can be found in @xcite .    in the overdamped regime",
    "we are able to give an approximate analytical solution for the problem , which is expected to be valid in the large correlation time regime ( @xmath78 ) : we perform the adiabatic approximation of solving the fokker - planck equation associated to eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) assuming a constant value of @xmath18 @xcite , analogous to the one used in @xcite .",
    "this leads us to obtain an @xmath18dependent value of the current @xmath79 that is then averaged over @xmath18 using the distribution @xmath42 @xcite with the desired value of @xmath0 @xmath80    in fig .",
    "4 , we show typical analytical results for the current and the efficiency as functions of @xmath0 together with results coming from numerical simulations ( for the complete system given by eqs.([xpto ] ) and ( [ etapto ] ) ) .",
    "calculations have been done in a parameter region similar to that studied in @xcite but considering ( apart from the difference provided by the non gaussian noise ) a non ",
    "zero load force that leads to a non  vanishing efficiency . as can be seen ,",
    "although there is not a quantitative agreement between theory and simulations , the adiabatic approximation predicts qualitatively very well the behavior of @xmath81 and @xmath70 as @xmath0 is varied .",
    "as shown in the figure , the current grows monotonously with @xmath0 ( at least for @xmath40 ) while there is an optimal value of @xmath0 ( @xmath82 ) which gives the maximum efficiency .",
    "this fact could be interpreted as follows : when @xmath0 is increased , the width of the @xmath42 distribution grows and high values of the non gaussian noise become more frequent , leading to an improvement of the current .",
    "although the mean value of @xmath81 increases monotonously with @xmath0 , the efficiency decays when @xmath0 approaches @xmath83 since the denominator in the definition of @xmath70 , which is essentially the dispersion of the noise distribution , diverges .    .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the adiabatic approximation , the line with squares shows results from simulations .",
    "all calculations are for @xmath84 and @xmath85.,width=377 ]    in fig .",

    "( [ etapto ] ) .",
    "the results correspond to @xmath86 , hence , the only noise present in the system is the non gaussian one . on the curve corresponding to the results for @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "5.a ) , we indicate with error bars the dispersion of the results .    .",
    "results from simulations at @xmath86 for @xmath56 ( squares ) , @xmath87 ( circles ) , and @xmath88 ( triangles ) . all calculations are for @xmath89 and @xmath85.,width=377 ]    it is possible to observe that a huge growth on the fluctuations of @xmath81 occurs for the same values of @xmath0 for which the efficiency decays .",
    "this result induces to think of a connection between the enhancement of the fluctuations on @xmath81 and the growth of the width of @xmath42 occurring for @xmath90 ( which , as stated above , is the origin of the efficiency decay ) .",
    "a simple , however useful , interpretation of this connection can be given : for @xmath38 , in spite of having a large ( positive ) mean value of the current , for a given realization of the process , the transport of the particle towards the desired direction is far from being assured ( due to the fluctuations on @xmath81 ) .",
    "hence , we could say that the transport mechanism ceases to be efficient .",
    "it is worth recalling here that @xmath4 corresponds to the gaussian ou noise @xcite .",
    "hence , these results for constant @xmath31 and @xmath19 seem to show that the transport mechanism becomes more efficient when the stochastic forcing has a non gaussian distribution with @xmath91 .",
    "let us now discuss the case with inertia and after that we will return to this aspect through an alternative approach .",
    "now we turn to study the @xmath92 case , that is , the situations in which the inertia effects are relevant .",
    "hence , we consider the complete form of eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) . in fig .",
    "6 we show the dependence of the current @xmath81 on the mass @xmath6 for different values of @xmath0 at constant @xmath31 and @xmath19 .",
    "the results are from simulations for zero temperature and without load force .",
    "it can be seen that , as @xmath6 is increased from @xmath93 , the inertial effects initially contribute to increase the current , until an optimal value of @xmath6 is reached . as expected , for high values of @xmath6 ,",
    "the motion of the particle becomes difficult and , for @xmath94 , the current vanishes .     and",
    "@xmath95 and for different values of @xmath0 : circles @xmath4 ( gaussian noise case ) , squares @xmath96.,width=377 ]    an interesting effect appears for @xmath96 . for a well defined interval of the value of the mass ( ranging approximately from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ) ,",
    "a negative current is observed .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the high value of the mass , that makes inertial effects much more important than those of the ratchet potential",
    ". the same velocity s change of sign for high inertia has been observed in @xcite for an ou noise ( @xmath4 ) for different values of the parameters .",
    "however , in the region of parameters here considered , the effect occurs only if we consider a non gaussian noise with a value of @xmath91 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors give an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the so called `` running states '' ( i.e. transitions between wells that are separated by several periods ) which is also valid here as was observed in results from simulations for single realizations of the process .",
    "these results suggest the possibility that the mass separation capability of a ratchet system may be in general enhanced by the inclusion of non gaussian noises , since we have found mass separation in a region of parameters where it is not observed for ou noise .",
    "but the separation of masses found here , occurs for particles with a ratio of masses of the order of @xmath99 or more ( say @xmath100 in fig .",
    "6 ) , while it has been shown in @xcite that , with a load force and considering simply ou noise , particles of much more similar masses can be separated by ratchets .    in order to compare results",
    ", we analyze the same system studied in @xcite but considering the non gaussian forcing described by eq.([etapto ] ) .",
    "hence , we study the system in eq.([xpto ] ) with @xmath101\\ ] ] as the ratchet potential , which is shown in fig . 3.b .",
    "we focus on the region of parameters where , in @xcite ( for @xmath4 ) , separation of masses was found .",
    "we fix @xmath102 , and @xmath103 and assume the values of the masses @xmath104 and @xmath105 as in @xcite .",
    "our main result is that the separation of masses is enhanced when a non  gaussian noise with @xmath91 is considered . in fig .",
    "7.a we show @xmath81 as function of @xmath0 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it can be seen that there is an optimum value of @xmath0 that maximizes the difference of currents .",
    "this value , which is close to @xmath108 , is indicated with a vertical double arrow .",
    "another double arrow indicates the separation of masses occurring for @xmath4 ( gaussian ou forcing ) .",
    "we have observed that when the value of the load force is varied , the difference between the curves remains approximately constant but both are shifted together to positive or negative values ( depending on the sign of the variation of the loading ) . by controlling this parameter",
    "it is possible to achieve , for example , the situation shown in fig .",
    "7.b , where , for the value of @xmath0 at which the difference of currents is maximal , the heavy `` species '' remains static on average ( has @xmath109 ) , while the light one has @xmath110 .",
    "also it is possible to get the situation shown in fig .",
    "7.c , at which , for the optimal @xmath0 , the two species move in opposite directions with equal average velocity .     for particles of masses @xmath111 ( hollow circles ) and @xmath112 ( solid squares ) .",
    "calculations for three different values of the load force : @xmath113 ( a ) , @xmath114 ( b ) and @xmath115 ( c).,width=453 ]",
    "we consider here the second point of view .",
    "it corresponds to studying the behavior of current and efficiency as function of @xmath0 when @xmath41 and @xmath37 are kept constant ( instead of @xmath31 and @xmath19 as was done in the previous section ) .",
    "this approach is more consistent with the image of @xmath18 as a primary ( natural ) source of noise , and it isolates the effects of the non - gaussian character of the noise distributions by keeping the dispersion and correlation time at fixed values .",
    "we consider eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath8 as in fig .",
    "3.a ( see section iii.a , overdamped regime ) .",
    "in the simulations , for each value of @xmath0 , we have adapted the values of @xmath31 and @xmath19 in order to obtain the desired values of @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "this was done by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) together with the equation for the best fit for @xmath37 ( the third one , presented at the end of section ii ) .",
    "as @xmath0 is varied for constant @xmath41 , the efficiency is essentially proportional to the current .",
    "hence , we only present results for @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "8 we show the results for the current as function of @xmath0 for @xmath117 and different values of @xmath41 . an interesting result is found for low values of @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath118 it is observed that the current grows monotonously with @xmath0 through most of the range studied ( it decays for @xmath0 very close to @xmath83 ) .",
    "this means that , for @xmath91 we found an enhancement of @xmath81 with respect to the gaussian noise situation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this enhancement has to be attributed essentially to the non - gaussian character of the noise @xmath12 , as for every @xmath0 on each curve we have considered the same values of dispersion and correlation time .     for fixed @xmath119 and different fixed values of @xmath41 . from top to bottom , the curves are for @xmath120,@xmath121,@xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "all calculations are for @xmath124 and @xmath125.,width=377 ]    for higher values of @xmath41 the effect disappears : for ( @xmath126 ) the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath0 becomes flat in most of the range analyzed .",
    "this means that the non - gaussian character does not play a relevant role in this region of parameters , and the current and efficiency are essentially determined by the intensity and correlation time of the noise source @xmath18 , independently of the detailed statistical characteristics of the process @xmath12 . for even higher values of @xmath127 the optimum value of @xmath0 that maximizes the current tends toward values of @xmath21 ( results not shown ) .",
    "however in the range of @xmath0 analyzed the corresponding @xmath128 curves are essentially flat and the differences with the @xmath4 case are not distinguishable at all .",
    "hence , we can remark the enhancement effect occurring for @xmath91 at low values of @xmath41 .",
    "we consider now the case @xmath92 , and study the current as a function of @xmath0 for fixed values of @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "we fix @xmath61 and consider again the potential @xmath129 defined in section iii.b .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the results for @xmath128 at fixed @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for different values of the masses and the external force @xmath9 .",
    "it can be seen that , when considering @xmath132 , no remarkable enhancement of the mass separation capabilities of the system is found . moreover , for @xmath91 the mass separation effect decreases . however , an interesting fact is that we find an inversion of current when considering large enough values of @xmath0 ( depending on the mass and @xmath9 ) .",
    "this inversion of current is due essentially to the variation of the non - gaussian properties of the noise distribution , as @xmath41 and @xmath37 are kept fixed .     for fixed @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "we have systematically studied the effect of a colored non gaussian noise source on the transport properties of a brownian motor using two alternative points of view . in the first one ,",
    "we analyze the results for the current , efficiency and mass separation as functions of @xmath0 , for constant values of @xmath31 and @xmath19 , which are the parameters that could be adequately controlled , for example , in a designed technological device .",

    "the latter shows , in addition , an optimum value for a given degree of non gaussianity . when inertia is taken into account we have also found a considerable increment in the mass separation capability .",

    "in contrast , for higher values of @xmath41 , the fluctuations dominate the dynamics in such a way that the gaussian or non gaussian character of the noise produces no relevant differences .",
    "when studying inertial systems at constant @xmath41 and @xmath37 we have not observed relevant effects on the mass separation capability of the system , in the region of parameters considered : the effect of mass separation seems to be governed essentially by the noise intensity and the correlation time .",
