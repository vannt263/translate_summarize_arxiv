    "two - dimensional cellular patterns fill the plane without gaps or overlaps . even if we consider here only the class of patterns where most cells meet in threes , they are ubiquitous in nature : from 2d foams to biological tissues , including geology , hydrodynamics , ecology , geography ; as well as 2d cuts of 3d cellular patterns in metallurgy , astronomy , 3d foams and biological organisms @xcite",
    ". each cell is characterised by its area @xmath0 , which is an intrinsic property determined by the amount of matter it encloses , and its number of neighbours @xmath1 , which can vary according to the mutual arrangement of cells within the pattern .",
    "there are at least two quantities which characterise the disorder of a pattern : the distribution of @xmath0 and the distribution of @xmath1 @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we study whether it is possible to simplify the description of disorder to only two numbers , namely the width of each distributions , called , respectively , the geometrical and topological disorders . both measures of disorder",
    "are independent @xcite",
    ". however , statistically , a cell s value of @xmath1 tends to increase with its size ( perimeter or area ) : small cells tend to have fewer neighbours , and larger cells have more neighbours ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can thus expect that , except when the initial conditions due to preparation are important , there is a correlation between these two measures of disorder . we investigate here , on different examples but focusing on a 2d foam , whether this intuition is correct and under which conditions the disorder of a pattern can statistically be described by a _",

    "it provides all the properties that we require ( unlike both other main types of quasi-2d foams , namely between two parallel glass plates , or at the surface of water exposed to air @xcite ) : the water provides easy access to the foam and enables us to prepare precisely the chosen distribution of bubble areas .",
    "it also facilitates the manipulation of the boundaries , in particular that of the rubber bands ( see below ) .",
    "the glass plate facilitates observation and prevents bubbles from breaking : the foam lifetime is limited only by coarsening , which takes several hours and does not affect the results presented below .",
    "the trough is a rectangle 44 cm long and 20 cm wide .",
    "the foam is enclosed in a smaller square of size @xmath2 @xmath3 , with four independent boundaries ( fig .",

    "another rigid rod ( moving boundary ) is attached to the glass lid , which slides laterally under teh control of a motor .",
    "the rectangle is closed on each side by a rubber band ( passive boundaries ) : it thus deforms into a parallelogram at constant area ( fig .",

    "a pump blows air into a tube placed below the surface of water , which is moved back and forth to produce an homogeneous foam . at low flow rate ,",
