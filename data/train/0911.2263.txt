    "the asymptotic behaviour of invariant metrics has been studied by several authors , graham @xcite , catlin @xcite , krantz @xcite , diederich - herbort @xcite , lee @xcite , and others .    in this paper",
    ", we study the behavior of the kobayashi metric , which is defined as follows :    let @xmath1 be a domain , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the kobayashi metric @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the family of holomorphic mappings from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the unit disc in @xmath10 .    let @xmath11 be a smoothly bounded domain and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the unit outward normal vector to @xmath15 at @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "we want to estimate @xmath18 as @xmath19 goes to @xmath20 , i.e. , as the point @xmath21 approaches the boundary point @xmath16 along the normal line to the boundary .",

    "catlin @xcite showed ( [ 1011 ] ) is true when @xmath23 is a finite type pseudoconvex domain in @xmath31 and lee @xcite proved it for convex domains in @xmath29 .",
