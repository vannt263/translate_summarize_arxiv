    "considerable evidence connects long - duration grbs to star - forming regions ( see @xcite for review ) and , consequently , to the high - mass stars that radiate strongly in the uv band and evolve to supernova core collapse . for example , the host galaxies of grbs have blue colors , consistent with galaxy types that are undergoing active star formation .",
    "grb counterparts are found within the optical radii and central regions of the host galaxies .",
    "lack of optical counterparts in approximately one - half of grbs with well - localized x - ray afterglows ( so - called  dark bursts \" ) could be due to extreme reddening from large quantities of gas and dust in star - forming host galaxies .",
    "supernova - like emissions have been detected in the late - time optical decay curves of a few grbs including , most recently , the low redshift ( @xmath1 ) grb 030329 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , x - ray features have been detected in about 6 grbs , which implies the existence of dense , highly enriched material in the vicinity of the sources of grbs ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "this includes the variable absorption feature attributed to photoionization of fe in grb 990705 , k@xmath2 and recombination edges from highly ionized fe and s in the afterglow spectra of grb 991216 , multiple high - ionization emission features detected in grb 011211 and , at lower significance , claimed x - ray fe k@xmath2 features in grb 970508 , grb 970828 , and grb 000214 .",
    "the association of grb 980425 and the type ic sn 1998bw @xcite , if true , directly connects grbs and sne .",
    "the well - measured light curve of sn 1998bw has been used in a number of cases to model reddened excesses in the optical afterglow spectra found tens of days after the grb , again pointing to a sn / grb connection .",
    "because supernovae are widely thought to accelerate galactic cosmic rays , the supernovae associated with grbs should play a special role in the cr / grb connection . here",
    "we summarize work connecting crs , sne , and grbs , beginning with source models of grbs and arguments for cr acceleration by supernovae .",
    "high - energy neutrino detection with km - scale telescopes such as icecube would conclusively establish that hadrons are accelerated by grbs , and is likely if grb sources are hadronically dominated by a factor of @xmath3 or more .",
    "this would be required in a grb model that accelerates nonthermal power - law distributions of particles to produce ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies @xmath4 ev , and super - gzk crs with energies @xmath5 ev .",
    "hadronic cascade radiation could make grbs luminous sources of gev - tev emission that would be detectable with _",
    "glast _ , _ veritas _ , and _ hess_.",
    "leading scenarios for the sources of long - duration grbs are the collapsar and supranova models . in the former case @xcite , grbs are formed in the seconds to minutes following the collapse of the core of a massive star to a black hole . during the collapse process , a nuclear - density , several solar - mass accretion disk forms and accretes on the newly born black hole at the rate of @xmath6-@xmath7 s@xmath8 to drive a baryon - dilute , relativistic outflow through the surrounding stellar envelope .",
    "the duration of the accretion episode corresponds to the period of activity of the relativistic winds that are argued to produce the prompt variable grb emission .",
    "a wide variety of collapsar models are possible @xcite , but their central feature is the one - step collapse of the core of a massive star to a black hole . a major difficulty of this model is to drive a baryon - dilute , relativistic outflow through the stellar envelope @xcite .    in the supranova model @xcite , grbs are the second in a two - step collapse process of an evolved massive stellar core to a black hole through the intermediate formation of a neutron star with mass exceeding several solar masses . the neutron star is initially stabilized against collapse by rotation , but the loss of angular momentum support through magnetic dipole and gravitational radiation leads to collapse of the neutron star to a black hole after some weeks to years .",
    "a two - step collapse process means that the neutron star is surrounded by a sn shell of enriched material at distances of @xmath9-@xmath10 cm from the central source .",
    "the earlier sn could yield @xmath6-@xmath11 of fe in the surrounding vicinity to provide a surrounding shell of material that forms prompt and afterglow x - ray features in grb spectra .",
    "a pulsar wind and pulsar wind bubble consisting of a quasi - uniform , low density , highly magnetized pair - enriched medium within the snr shell is formed by a highly magnetized neutron star during the period of activity preceding its collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the pulsar wind with the shell material will fragment and accelerate the snr shell , and the pulsar wind emission will be a source of ambient radiation that can be comptonized to gamma - ray energies @xcite",
    ". the heating of the sn shell by the plerionic emission could give rise to a characteristic cooling shell signature , which might explain some instances of the delayed reddened excesses in optical afterglow spectra @xcite .    in both the collapsar and supranova models ,",
    "the stellar progenitors are @xmath12m@xmath13 stars that evolve to core collapse and produce a supernova with an expanding nonrelativistic shell , and a grb with its highly relativistic ejecta .",
    "the shocks formed in these nonrelativstic and relativistic outflows can accelerate cosmic rays .",
    "the strongest argument that hadronic cosmic rays ( crs ) are powered by snrs is probably the claim that only sne inject sufficient power into the galaxy to provide the measured energy density of crs @xcite . a time- and volume - averaged kinetic luminosity @xmath14 ergs s@xmath8 in the disk of the milky way is required to power the galactic crs .",
    "the galactic sn luminosity is @xmath15 sn@xmath16 yrs@xmath17 ergs / sn @xmath18 ergs s@xmath8 which , given a 10% efficiency for converting the directed kinetic energy of sne into crs that seems feasible through the shock - fermi mechanism , is adequate to power the cosmic radiation .",
    "besides available power , fermi acceleration at snr shocks offers another strong argument that cosmic rays originate from supernovae . in fermi models ,",
    "the directed kinetic energy of a nonrelativistic or relativistic outflow is transferred to a small fraction of suprathermal particles , either through repeated scattering and diffusion upstream and downstream of the shock front ( first - order fermi acceleration ) , or through energy diffusion accompanying stochastic pitch - angle scatterings with the magnetic turbulence spectrum ( second - order fermi acceleration ) .    as compared with some other acceleration mechanisms , for example , charge - depletion fields in pulsar magnetospheres or through magnetic reconnection in stellar flares , the shock - fermi mechanism naturally produces power - law particle spectra , at least in the test particle approximation .",
    "first - order fermi acceleration at a nonrelativistic strong shock gives the canonical test - particle shock index @xmath19 , and first - order fermi at a relativistic shock gives the canonical test particle shock index @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "modifying these standard injection indices through energy - dependent diffusion for impulsive , steady , or stochastic injection models offers a wide range of flexibility to explain observations of cosmic rays .",
    "arguments for a connection between crs and grb sources are based on the coincidence between available power of grbs within the gzk radius and the power required to accelerate super - gzk particles . moreover , the available power from grbs within our galaxy is sufficient to accelerate crs between the knee at @xmath21 ev and the ankle at @xmath22 ev ( if these crs are trapped in the halo of our galaxy ) , and could even power a significant fraction of the gev - tev / nuc cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the larmor radius of a particle with energy @xmath23 ev is @xmath24 kpc .",
    "unless super - gzk crs are heavy nuclei , they probably originate from outside our galaxy . based on assumptions that the faintest batse grbs are at redshifts @xmath25 ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the energy density of super - gzk crs is comparable to the energy density that would be produced by grb sources within the gzk radius , assuming that the measured @xmath0-ray energy from grbs is roughly equal to the total energy deposited in the form of uhecrs .",
    "this coincidence is verified by a detailed estimate of grb power in the context of the external shock model for grbs @xcite .",
    "a prediction of this hypothesis is that star - forming galaxies which host grb activity will be surrounded by neutron - decay halos .",
    "the local density of @xmath26 galaxies like the milky way galaxy can be derived from the schechter luminosity function , and is @xmath27(200 - 500 mpc@xmath28 ) .",
    "the batse observations imply @xmath29 grbs / day over the full sky . due to beaming , this rate is increased by a factor of 500 @xcite .",
    "this implies an event rate of about 1 grb in the milky way every @xmath30-@xmath31 years , and an energy injection rate of @xmath32 ergs s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this estimate takes into account the assumption that the grb rate density follows the star - formation rate history of the universe , and a factor of @xmath33 to account for the contribution from clean and dirty fireballs , such as the x - ray rich grbs , for every classical long - duration grb .",
    "thus the grb rate is about 10% as frequent as type ib / c sne , and about 1% as frequent as type ii sne .    because each grb has a total energy release of a few @xmath34 ergs , a factor of a few greater than the energy release in  normal \" sne , but occurs @xmath35 times less frequently , the available power from the sources of grbs is a few per cent of the power from type ia and type ii sne . the efficiency for accelerating crs in the relativistic outflows of grbs could be much greater than in nonrelativistic sne , so that the progenitor sources of grbs could make a significant contribution to crs at all energies .    from the rate estimates , we see that about 1 in 10 to 1 in 100 snrs would exhibit this enhanced emission from strong cr acceleration due to an associated grb . the better imaging and sensitivity of the _ glast _ telescope and",
    "the next generation of imaging ground - based air cherenkov telescopes , namely veritas , hess and magic , will test this hypothesis .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from km - scale telescopes such as icecube will establish hadronic acceleration in sources such as blazars and grbs .",
    "we @xcite have recently completed the first quantitative set of calculations of photomeson neutrino production for the collapsar and supranova models of grbs that also treats associated @xmath36 pair - production attenuation of the emergent @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "this model takes into account nonthermal proton injection followed by photomeson energy loss , based on our photo - hadronic model for blazar jets @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption in our calculations is that equal kinetic energy is injected in nonthermal protons as is measured in hard x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "given the fluence of a grb , the energy injected in protons therefore depends only on the doppler factor @xmath37 .",
    "neutrinos will be formed through photomeson production with internal synchrotron radiation and , in the supranova model , with external synchrotron photons emitted by the pulsar wind electrons .",
    "even with the very strong radiation field that could occur in the supranova model , model - independent arguments @xcite , which we reproduce here , show that it is not possible under the assumption of equal energy in hadrons and observed radiation to detect neutrinos from any grbs except those exceedingly rare events at the level @xmath38 ergs @xmath39 , which occur about 2 - 5 times per year @xcite .    the detection efficiency in water or ice of ultrarelativistic upward - going muon neutrinos ( @xmath40 ) with energies @xmath41 ev is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "for a neutrino fluence spectrum parameterized by @xmath47 erg @xmath39 , the number of @xmath40 detected with a km - scale @xmath48 detector such as icecube with area @xmath49 @xmath50 is therefore @xmath51 where @xmath52(1-{\\epsilon_t}^{\\alpha_\\nu})$ ] . for a @xmath53 spectrum with @xmath54 , the number of @xmath40 to be expected",
    "are @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if the nonthermal proton energy injected in the proper frame is comparable to the radiated energy required to form grbs with hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray fluences @xmath59 ergs @xmath39 , then extremely bright grbs are required to leave any prospect for detecting @xmath40 with km - scale neutrino detectors .",
    "this estimate does not take into account the loss of efficiency to produce @xmath40 from energetic protons through photomeson processes , so the number of @xmath40 detected from individual grbs would be even less .",
    "1 shows the total @xmath40 fluences expected from a model grb with a photon fluence of @xmath60 ergs @xmath39 that is radiated in 50 one - second pulses .",
    "the variability time scale determines the size scale of the emitting region given @xmath37 , and thus the intensity of internal synchrotron photons for photomeson production .",
    "the thin curves show collapsar model results at @xmath61 200 , and 300 .",
    "the expected numbers of @xmath40 that a km - scale neutrino detector would detect are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively . the heavy solid and dashed curves in fig .  1",
    "give the supranova model predictions of @xmath65 for both @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the equipartition magnetic fields used in this calculation are 1.9 kg and 0.25 kg , respectively .",
    "the external radiation field in the supranova model makes the neutrino detection rate insensitive to the value of @xmath37 ( as well as to the variability time scale , as verified by calculations ) . as the above estimate shows",
    ", there is no prospect to detect @xmath40 from grbs at this levels or from a grb with a factor of ten more fluence .",
    "although this calculation is not optimistic for neutrino detection , note that the coincidence between the power released by grbs in @xmath0 rays within the gzk radius and the power required for the super - gzk crs assumes that equal energy is injected into the highest energy cosmic rays as is detected as grb photon radiation .",
    "this is possible in a second - order fermi acceleration scheme where a very hard , very high energy particle population is produced @xcite .",
    "if particles are instead injected with a @xmath68 or @xmath69 spectrum through a first - order fermi mechanism , then grbs must be hadronically dominated if they are to power the uhecrs .",
    "thus , @xmath3 - 100 times as much power must be injected in hadrons as is inferred from the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray emission from grbs . under these conditions",
    ", icecube could expect to detect high - energy neutrinos from several grbs each year .",
    "such a discovery would have a profound impact on our understanding of cosmic rays .",
    "in addition , luminous mev - gev - tev cascade radiation induced by hadronic secondaries would be produced .",
    "observations of distinct @xmath0-ray components in grb spectra would also support the grb / cr connection .",
    "many lines of evidence point to a close linkage between supernovae , gamma - ray bursts , and cosmic rays .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from the sources of grbs would confirm hadron acceleration to very high energies . under the assumption that equal energy is injected into protons as is measured in radiation , we have found @xcite that there is no realistic prospect for neutrino detection except from the most fluent grbs at a level @xmath38 ergs @xmath39 .",
    "more optimistic estimates from the viewpoint of detecting grb neutrinos could be found in proton - dominated grb models . without this hypothesis",
    "only the brightest grbs can be expected to be detected with both high - energy @xmath0-ray and neutrino detectors .",
    "the assumption of hadronically dominated grbs is required to provide the required energy in uhecrs if the protons are accelerated in the form of a power law with number index steeper than @xmath68 .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from grbs would test scenarios for grbs , the hypothesis that grbs sources are powerful accelerators of ultrarelativistic crs , and our understanding of the origin of grb radiation ."
