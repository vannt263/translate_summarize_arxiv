    "a representation equivalent to ( [ riesz ] ) in term of polynomial kernels is : @xmath50 if @xmath22 is a polynomial of order @xmath51 the series terminates at @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , for general @xmath52 , the individual orthogonal polynomials @xmath53 are uniquely determined by their leading coefficients of degree @xmath3 and @xmath54 . if a leading term is @xmath55 then @xmath56 , \\label{leadingq}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 has distribution @xmath6 .",

    "this can be shown by using their expansions in an orthonormal polynomial set and applying ( [ leadingq ] ) .",
    "+ the polynomial kernels with respect to @xmath67 and @xmath68 will be denoted by @xmath69 and @xmath70 and called jacobi and hahn kernels , respectively .",
    "+   + this paper is divided in two parts .",
    "the goal of the first part is to describe jacobi and hahn kernels under a unified view : we will first provide a probabilistic description of their structure and mutual relationship , then we will investigate their symmetrized and infinite - dimensional versions .",
    "+ in the second part of the paper we will turn our attention to the problem of identifying canonical correlation sequences with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath71 we will restrict our focus on sequences @xmath31 such that , for every @xmath72 @xmath73 for these sequences , jacobi or hahn polynomial kernels will be used to find out conditions for a sequence @xmath74 to satisfy the inequality @xmath75 + since @xmath33 is required to map constant functions to constant functions , a straightforward necessary condition is always that @xmath76 for every @xmath77 and every @xmath78 we will call any solution to ( [ cop2 ] ) an _ @xmath79-jacobi positive definite sequence ( @xmath79-jpds ) _ if @xmath80 and an _ @xmath79-hahn postive - definite sequence ( @xmath79-hpds ) _ if @xmath81 + we are interested , in particular , in studying if and when one or both the following statements are true .    * for every @xmath1 and @xmath78 @xmath31 is @xmath79-jpds @xmath82 @xmath31 is @xmath83-jpds for every @xmath84 * for every @xmath1 and @xmath78 @xmath31 is @xmath79-jpds @xmath82 @xmath31 is @xmath79-hpds .    regarding ( p1 ) , it will be clear in section [ sec : pdandk ] that the sufficiency part ( @xmath85 ) always holds . to find conditions for the necessity part ( @xmath86 ) of ( p1 )",
    ", we will use two alternative approaches .",
    "the first one is based on a multivariate extension of a powerful product formula for the jacobi polynomials , due to koornwinder and finalized by gasper in the early 1970 s : for @xmath87 in a certain region(see theorem [ gasper ] further on ) , the integral representation    @xmath88    holds for a probability measure @xmath89 on [ 0,1 ] .",
    "our extension for multivariate polynomial kernels , of non - easy derivation , is found in proposition [ prop:1 ] to be @xmath90,\\ \\ |n|=0,1,\\ldots\\label{protoprop}\\ ] ] for every @xmath1 and @xmath78 in a certain region , and for a particular @xmath91$]-valued random variable @xmath92 . here , for every @xmath93 @xmath94",
    "is the vector with all zero components except for the j - th coordinate which is equal to 1 .",
    "integral representations such as ( [ protoprop ] ) are useful in that they map immediately univariate positive functions to the type of bivariate distribution we are looking for : @xmath95=\\sum_{|n|}{\\widehat{f}}(n)q_{|n|}(x , y)\\geq 0.\\ ] ] in fact , whenever ( [ protoprop ] ) holds true , we will be able to conclude that ( p1 ) is true .",
    "+ the identity ( [ protoprop ] ) holds only with particular choices of the parameter @xmath79 . at the best",
    "one needs one of the @xmath96 s to be greater than 2 .",
    "this makes it hard to use ( p1 ) to build canonical correlations with respect to poisson - dirichlet limit marginals on the infinite simplex .",
    "the latter would be a desirable aspect for modeling dependent measures on the infinite symmetric group or for applications e.g. in nonparametric bayesian statistics .",
    "+ on the other hand , there are several examples in the literature of positive - definite sequences satisfying ( p1 ) for every choice of @xmath97 even in the limit case of @xmath98 .",
    "two notable and well - known instances are    * @xmath99 arising as the eigenvalues of the transition semigroup of the so - called _ @xmath1-type , neutral wright - fisher diffusion process in population genetics . _ * @xmath100 i.e. the eigenvalues of the so - called poisson kernel , whose positivity is a well - known result in special functions theory ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .    a probabilistic account of the relationship existing between examples ( i ) and ( ii ) is given in @xcite .",
    "+ it is therefore natural to ask when ( p1 ) holds with no constraints on the parameter @xmath101 + our second approach to lancaster s problem will answer in part to this question .",
    "this approach is heavily based on the probabilistic interpretation of the jacobi and hahn polynomial kernels shown in the first part of the paper .",
    "we will prove in proposition [ pr : gspd ] that , if @xmath102 is a probability mass function ( pmf ) on @xmath103 then every positive - definite sequence @xmath104 of the form @xmath105 satisfies ( p1 ) for every choice of @xmath97 therefore ( p1 ) can be used to model canonical correlations with respect to the poisson - dirichlet distribution .",
    "+ in section [ sec : pd2prob ] we investigate the possibility of a converse result , i.e. will find a set of conditions on a jpd sequence @xmath31 to be of the form ( [ d2rhoproto ] ) for a pmf @xmath106 + as for hahn positive - definite sequences and ( p2 ) , our results will be mostly consequence of proposition [ pr : kdm ] , where we establish the following representation of hahn kernels as mixtures of jacobi kernels : @xmath107\\ \\ |n|=0,1,\\ldots\\ ] ] for every @xmath37 and @xmath108 where the expectation on the right - hand side is taken with respect to @xmath109 i.e. a product of _ posterior _ dirichlet probability measures .",
    "a similar result was proven by @xcite to hold for individual hahn polynomials as well .",
    "+ we will also show ( proposition [ prp : hintf ] ) that a discrete version of ( [ protoprop ] ) ( but with the appearance of an extra coefficient ) holds for hahn polynomial kernels .",
    "+ based on these findings , we will be able to prove in section [ sec : hpds ] some results close to(p2 ) : we will show that jpdss can be viewed as a map from hpdss and also the other way around , but such mappings are not in general the identity ( i.e. ( p2 ) ) .",
    "+ on the other way , we will show ( proposition [ bernpds ] ) that every jpds is indeed the limit of a sequence of ( p2)-positive - definite sequences .",
    "+ our final result on hpdss is in proposition [ prp : p2 ] , where we prove that if , for every @xmath0 , a jpds @xmath31 is of the form [ d2rhoproto ] , for a probability distribution @xmath110 such that @xmath111 for @xmath112 , then ( p2 ) holds properly . such sequences also satisfy ( p1 ) and admit infinite - dimensional poisson - dirichlet ( and ewens sampling distribution ) limits .",
    "+ the key for the proof of proposition [ prp : p2 ] is provided by proposition [ vdmk ] , where we show the connection between our representation of hahn kernels and a kernel generalization of a product formula for hahn polynomials , proved by gasper @xcite in 1973 .",
    "proposition [ vdmk ] is , in our opinion , of some interest even independently of its application .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : distn ] will conclude this introduction by recalling some basic properties and definitions of the probability distribution we are going to deal with . in section [ sec : k1 ] an explicit description of @xmath113",
    "is given in terms of mixtures of products of multinomial probability distributions .",
    "we will next obtain ( section [ sec : k2 ] ) an explicit representation for @xmath114 as _ posterior mixtures _ of @xmath113 .",
    "this is done by applying an analogous relationship which was proved in @xcite to hold for individual orthogonal polynomials . in the same section",
    "we will generalize gasper s product formula to an alternative representation of @xmath115 and will describe the connection coefficients in the two representations . in sections",
    "[ sec : kpd]-[sec : esfk ] we will then show that similar structure and probabilistic descriptions also hold for kernels with respect to the ranked versions of @xmath34 and @xmath116 , and to their infinite - dimensional limits , known as the poisson - dirichlet and the ewens sampling distribution , respectively . as an immediate application , symmetrized",
    "jacobi kernels will be used in section [ sec : sp ] to characterize _ individual _",
    "( i.e. not kernels ) orthogonal polynomials with respect to the _ ranked _ dirichlet distribution",
    ". this will conclude the first part .",
    "+ sections [ sec : irjpk]-[sec : irhpk ] will be the bridge between the first and the second part of the paper .",
    "we will prove the identity ( [ protoprop ] ) for the jacobi product formula and its hahn equivalent .",
    "we will point out the connection between ( [ protoprop ] ) and another multivariate jacobi product formula due to koornwinder and schwartz @xcite . in section [ sec : pdandk ] we will use the results of section [ sec : irjpk ] to characterize sequences obeying to ( p1 ) , with constraints on @xmath97 and will investigate the existence of sequences satisfying ( p2 ) .",
    "+ in section [ sec : prob ] we will find sufficient conditions for ( p1 ) to hold with no constraints on the parameters , when a jpds can be expressed as a linear functional of a probability distribution on @xmath117 we will discuss the possibility of a converse mapping from jpdss to probability mass functions in section [ sec : pd2prob ] .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we consider a multivariate version of the so - called lancaster problem of characterizing canonical correlation coefficients of symmetric bivariate distributions with identical marginals and orthogonal polynomial expansions . </S>",
    "<S> the marginal distributions examined in this paper are the dirichlet and the dirichlet - multinomial distribution , respectively on the continuous and the @xmath0-discrete @xmath1-dimensional simplex . </S>",
    "<S> their infinite - dimensional limit distributions , respectively the poisson - dirichlet distribution and the ewens sampling formula , are considered as well . </S>",
    "<S> we study in particular the possibility of mapping canonical correlations on the @xmath1-dimensional continuous simplex ( i ) to canonical correlation sequences on the @xmath2-dimensional simplex and/or ( ii ) to canonical correlations on the discrete simplex , and viceversa . </S>",
    "<S> driven by this motivation , the first half of the paper is devoted to providing a full characterization and probabilistic interpretation of @xmath3-orthogonal polynomial kernels ( i.e. sums of products of orthogonal polynomials of the same degree @xmath3 ) with respect to the mentioned marginal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> orthogonal polynomial kernels are important to overcome some non - uniqueness difficulties arising when dealing with multivariate orthogonal ( or bi - orthogonal ) polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> we establish several identities and some integral representations which are multivariate extensions of important results known for the case @xmath4 since the 1970 s . </S>",
    "<S> these results , along with a common interpretation of the mentioned kernels in terms of dependent polya urns , are shown to be key features leading to several non - trivial solutions to lancaster s problem , many of which can be extended naturally to the limit as @xmath5 </S>"
