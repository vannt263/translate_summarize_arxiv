    "in this paper we study the asymptotic properties related to connectivity of random geometric graphs where the underlying distribution of the vertices may not be uniform . a random geometric graph ( rgg ) consists of a set of vertices that are distributed in space independently , according to some common probability density function .",
    "the edge set of the graph consists of the set of all pairs of points that are within a specified cut - off distance .",
    "our point of departure from usual random geometric graphs is the specification of a cut - off function @xmath7 that determines the edge set .",
    "a directed edge exists , from a vertex located at @xmath4 to another vertex located at @xmath8 , provided the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath8 is less than @xmath9 .",
    "our motivation for the study of such graphs comes from applications in wireless networks . in models of wireless networks as rggs",
    ", the nodes are assumed to be communicating entities that are distributed randomly in space according to some underlying density .",
    "nodes are assumed to communicate effectively with other nodes that are within a cut - off distance , that is , proportional to the transmission power .",
    "hence , the transmission power has to be sufficiently large for the network to be connected .",
    "however , nodes that are within each other s transmission range interfere and thus can not transmit simultaneously . in order to maximize spatial reuse , that is , the simultaneous use of the medium by several nodes to communicate",
    ", the transmission power should be minimized .",
    "thus the asymptotic behavior of the critical radius of connectivity in a random geometric graph as the number of vertices becomes large is of considerable interest .",
    "often the nodes are assumed to be distributed in @xmath10^d$ ] according to a poisson point process of intensity @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", it is known that the critical connectivity radius scales as @xmath11 if the underlying density is nonuniform but bounded away from zero , then ( see penrose  @xcite ) the asymptotic behavior of the largest nearest neighbor distance in the graph is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the minimum of the density over its support .",
    "note that the asymptotics of the largest nearest neighbor distance is determined by the reciprocal of the minimum of the density , since it is in the vicinity of the minimum that the nodes are sparsely distributed .",
    "in many applications such as mobile ad - hoc networks and sensor networks , the distribution of the nodes may be far from uniform ( see , e.g. , foh et al .",
    "@xcite , santi  @xcite ) . in the case of nonuniform distribution of nodes",
    ", it is not efficient from the point of view of maximizing spatial reuse , for all nodes to use the same cut - off radius .",
    "nodes near the mode of the density require a much smaller radius than those at locations where the density is small .",
    "further , the infimum of the density over its support could be zero ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in such cases the asymptotics of the largest nearest neighbor distance or the connectivity threshold will be very different from that given above .",
    "one of the major objectives in a wireless sensor network is to maximize battery life , and hence it is important to minimize the energy expended in data transmission .",
    "these considerations leads us to rggs with location - dependent choice of radii . in many applications",
    ", it is assumed that the nodes know or can effectively estimate their location ( akkaya and younis  @xcite , langendoen and reijers  @xcite ) .",
    "we prescribe a formula for a critical location dependent cut - off radius depending on the intensity , so that almost surely the resulting graphs do not have isolated nodes eventually .",
    "a useful property of the graphs we construct is that the distribution of out - degree is independent of the location of the nodes .",
    "vertex degree distributions are important in designing algorithms for distributed computations over wireless networks where the performance worsens with increasing vertex degrees ( giridhar and kumar  @xcite ) .",
    "we derive strong law bounds for the maximum and minimum vertex degrees . by considering a finer parametrization of the cut - off function",
    ", we show that the number of vertices with zero out - degree converges to a poisson distribution , under some conditions on the underlying density .",
    "we illustrate the result with some examples . a result of this nature for usual random geometric graphs with the uniform and exponentially decaying densities of nodes can be found in penrose  @xcite , gupta and iyer  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the solution to the connectivity problem for random geometric graphs for nonvanishing densities with compact support and dimensions @xmath15 can be found , for example , in chapter 13 of penrose  @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "this problem is studied for densities in @xmath10 $ ] with polynomial rate of decay to zero in han and makowski  @xcite , while in gupta , iyer and manjunath  @xcite the density is assumed to be exponential or truncated exponential . in two dimensions , the asymptotic distribution for the critical connectivity threshold for a large class of densities , including elliptically contoured distributions , distributions with independent weibull - like marginals and distributions with parallel level curves",
    "is derived in hsing and rootzen  @xcite . in dimensions",
    "@xmath15 , penrose  @xcite obtains the asymptotic distribution for the connectivity threshold when the nodes are distributed according to a standard normal distribution . in this paper , we derive a sufficient condition for the rggs with location - dependent radius to be almost surely connected eventually .    in summary ,",
    "our primary motivation in proposing the study of graphs with location dependent radii is as follows .",
    "it is to enable the design and study of wireless and sensor networks that allow nonstandard distribution of nodes obtained by fitting densities to empirical data obtained from actual deployments .",
    "given such a density , each individual node can be programmed to choose a transmission radius depending on its location so that the network is connected with high probability .",
    "further , any change in the underlying distribution over time due to failures , re - deployments , etc .",
    ", can be easily accommodated by appropriately changing the transmission radii . as far as analyzing these graphs",
    "is concerned , the key features to contend with are that the edges are directed and that the cut - off radius is specified implicitly .    in order to state our results",
    "we need some notation .",
