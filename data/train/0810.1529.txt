    "a new commutator method based on such an inequality was proposed in @xcite . by analogy to the method of the conjugate operator , it has been called the method of the weakly conjugate operator ( mwco ) . under some technical assumptions ,",
    "both approaches lead to a limiting absorption principle , that is , a control of the resolvent of @xmath0 near the real axis . in the case of the usual method of the conjugate operator , this result is obtained locally in @xmath3 , and away from thresholds .",
    "the mwco establishes the existence of the boundary value of resolvent also at thresholds , but originally applies only to situations where the operator @xmath0 has a purely absolutely continuous spectrum .",

    "the derivation of the limiting absorption principle of @xcite has been abstracted in @xcite .",
    "the framework of @xcite is still the one of the mwco , but since its result applies a certain class of two - body schrdinger operators which have bound states below zero , it can also be considered as the first extension of the mwco dealing with operators that are not purely absolutely continuous .",
