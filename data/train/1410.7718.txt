    "the corresponding potential @xmath4 diverges , which could be shown by reducing the non - hermiticity in our model potential .",
    "even exactly at the exceptional point , where only one state is present in the system , the formalism can be applied .",
    "it leads to one wave function in the partner system with the correct energy . in principle , infinitely many superpotentials and hence also potentials of the fermionic sector can be found . this freedom can be used to either find partner potentials which preserve the relations of @xmath0 symmetry or lead to cases in which a non - hermitian non-@xmath0-symmetric potential exhibits real eigenvalues or even purely real spectra .    in an extension we investigated whether the formalism can also be used for the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we found that for small nonlinearities a partner potential can be constructed , of which the remaining state s energy is almost unchanged in comparison with its counterpart in the original system , whereas the other has vanished .",
    "thus , the results are very similar to the linear case and the most important feature of the supersymmetry concept is preserved in the nonlinear system .",
    "one state is removed from the spectrum without disturbing the others too much .",
    "unfortunately this is not true for stronger nonlinearities . here",
    "the simple construction of a superpotential with a procedure adapted from linear quantum mechanics will fail . however , the case of strong nonlinearities is the most interesting for the application of the formalism .",
    "it is desirable to remove the @xmath0-broken states branching off from one of the @xmath0-symmetric eigenstates and introducing a dynamical instability .",
    "certainly a way to extend the formalism to arbitrary strengths of the nonlinearity is the greatest challenge for future work . for this purpose it could be useful to investigate the many - particle description of the condensate in second quantisation .",
    "it could be promising to try to factorise the hamiltonian such that generalised creation and annihilation operators suitable for the supersymmetry concept can be introduced .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether then two supersymmetric partner systems can be created and how their mean - field limits are related to each other ."
