    "scattering processes involving excitons are at the heart of a wide range of phenomena in semiconductor optics .",
    "excitons are often treated as elementary bosons , but the complexity of the scattering problem obviously lies in their composite nature : excitons are coulomb - correlated quasiparticles made of two fermions , a conduction band electron and a valence band hole .",
    "it is only recently that a many - body theory of exciton scattering was put on firm grounds in a series of papers by combescot _ et al _ ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "their formalism , based on fermion commutation techniques , allows one to calculate correctly the scattering matrix elements as well as the transition rates of two excitons . in the present paper",
    ", we are only concerned with the simpler problem of exciton  carrier scattering , i.e. a 3-body problem with well defined interaction potentials between the three scattering partners , including exchange effects explicitly .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in exciton  free carrier scattering in iii  v gaas - based and ii  vi znse - based quantum - well systems",
    ".    early investigations of the microscopic mechanisms yielding low lasing thresholds and high optical gain in bulk semiconductor lasers included detailed theoretical and experimental studies of radiative recombination involving exciton scattering .",
    "various scattering processes including @xmath3 , @xmath4 lo - phonon , @xmath0 scattering @xcite and @xmath1 scattering @xcite were studied and compared , and it was reported that @xmath0 scattering is a process yielding important optical gain in bulk materials @xcite .",
    "in particular , haug and co - workers gave a detailed study of the temperature dependence of the lasing thresholds for each of the scattering process @xcite .",
    "later , feng and spector studied the exciton ",
    "free carrier elastic and inelastic scatterings in quantum wells to compute the related cross sections and exciton linewidths , but they did not account for carrier exchange in their analysis @xcite . here",
    ", the aim of our work is two - fold : first we want to compare the respective contributions of the direct and the exchange terms to the scattering matrix elements ; then we want to study quantitatively the exchange term dependence on the carrier effective mass and its impact on carrier - assisted exciton radiative recombination in quantum wells .",
    "the interest for extensive studies of photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra @xcite lies in the fact that they are useful to study a rich variety of phenomena in semiconductor physics and allow non - destructive characterization of semiconductors . in the case of mixed exciton / electron - hole plasmas ,",
    "many processes occur that contribute to pl spectra .",
    "these processes include : direct exciton recombination , electron - hole recombination and several scattering processes involving quasi - particles such as excitons , phonons and excited carriers .",
    "the importance of each contribution to pl depends on the thermodynamic properties of the plasma and hence on the excitation conditions as well as the type of material under consideration that determine the populations and temperatures of each quasi - particle gas . moreover , the dimensionality of the system is also of great importance since quantum confinement not only enhances the effective strength of the coulomb interaction between the carriers , but changes drastically the density of states of the particles .",
    "early works by kubo , martin and schwinger ( kms ) @xcite suggest that in quasi - equilibrium the intensity of pl is proportional to the absorption coefficient times the bose distribution describing the photon gas interacting with the semiconductor medium .",
    "detailed studies of the excitonic resonance features and their dynamics through pl spectra based on the kms approach led to the interpretation of the build - up of the excitonic resonance below the gap as direct evidence of excitonic formation on the sub - nanosecond timescale , see e.g. refs .  @xcite .",
    "however , calculations by kira _ et al _ @xcite clearly show that there is no straightforward connection between exciton formation and the presence of an excitonic peak in the emission : free plasma emission can occur at the exciton energy .",
    "et al _ @xcite reported later on the existence of luminescence at the exciton energy in gaas - based multiple quantum well , consistent with the theoretical work of kira _ et al _ @xcite , and chatterjee _ et al _ @xcite identified conditions under which the pl emission at the exciton resonance after excitation in the continuum is dominated by the free electron - hole plasma or by an incoherent exciton population at low temperature ( but they could not determine experimentally the fraction of excitons contributing to pl ) .",
    "this contradicts the findings reported by szczytko _",
    "et al _ @xcite who claimed that excitons provide the dominant contribution to the luminescence signals at the exciton energy , and concluded that for densities , temperatures , and time scales actually used in time - resolved experiments the coulomb correlated plasma contribution may be neglected .",
    "the conclusion on the role of a finite exciton population based on the results obtained from simple rate equations used by szczytko _",
    "et al _ may require further investigation to be confirmed , but models that take into account the existence of a finite population of excitons in excited qws deserve nonetheless attention .    in our model , we assume that the exciton and carrier populations at room temperature in a low density regime have reached thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "during the course of the scattering process , an exciton leaves its initial state and reaches the photon line before radiative recombination , transferring its momentum to its scattering partner , a free carrier .",
    "the exciton ",
    "electron scattering was found to be an important mechanism producing photoluminescence in bulk materials @xcite and optical gain in thin films @xcite .",
    "it is thus of interest to investigate this mechanism in mid - gap and wide - gap quantum wells , and also obtain further insight by including the exciton ",
    "hole scattering in the analysis .",
    "therefore , the object of the present work is _ not _ the calculation of the full pl spectra for which a full microscopic theory @xcite is required , but the quantitative study of the relative importance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering mechanisms , including exchange .",
    "direct exciton recombination , known to yield a strong emission at exciton energy @xcite , as well as scattering processes other than that of excitons with free carriers are beyond the scope of the present work and hence are not included in the paper .    a complete treatment of the balance between bound excitonic states , scattering states and free carriers is a difficult problem that has attracted attention for several years @xcite . in the case of qws",

    "@xcite where the degree of ionization , @xmath5 , of a non - degenerate two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron - hole plasma was calculated as the ratio @xmath6 of the density of free carriers , @xmath7 , to the total plasma density , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density of coulomb correlated carriers @xcite . to account for occupation of scattering states and overlap of exciton wavefunctions at moderate and high densities",
    "this concept was further refined in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that the definition of @xmath5 is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total density of carriers of type @xmath12 and @xmath13 originates from the interaction of carriers of type @xmath12 with carriers of type @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the ionization degree is now formulated in terms of elementary excitations ( electrons and holes ) .",
    "note that in the low density limit , @xmath13 can be identified to the exciton density .",
    "the degree of ionization whose values are between 0 and 1 , is both density and temperature dependent .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for wide - gap semiconductor quantum - wells at room temperature , the equilibrium consists of an almost equal mixture of correlated electron - hole pairs and uncorrelated free carriers whereas this is not the case for mid - gap materials .",
    "for a plasma temperature of 300 k , we ensure the occupation density is small enough ( nondegenerate limit ) to neglect phase - space filling effects . under these conditions ,",
    "the scattering between excitons and carriers involves mostly thermalized 1@xmath2 excitons with a finite center of mass momentum and free carriers .",
    "this assumption is valid at room temperature and moderate densities where the 1@xmath2 exciton population dominates all other coulomb correlations in the electron - hole plasma .",
    "calculations in an unscreened coulomb potential with hydrogen atom - like exciton wavefunctions have been reported by kavokin @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the electron - hole bound states are computed assuming a statically screened coulomb potential ( whose asymptotic behavior permits the application of the variable phase method @xcite ) .    in section",
    "ii we detail the basic assumptions made for the model of the interacting 2d electron - hole plasma and define the ionization degree .",
    "section iii is devoted to the derivation of the exciton wavefunctions from the variable phase theory .",
    "in section iv we calculate the exciton ",
    "free carrier scattering matrix elements that we include into fermi s golden rule to compute the related emission rates .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in section v , where photon emission rates induced by exciton ",
    "carrier scattering in znse and gaas qws are compared .",
    "in this work we assume the quantum - well structures to be ideal two - dimensional systems in a two - band model with parabolic dispersion , neglecting detail related to valence - band mixing .",
    "we consider a neutral low density , 2d plasma composed of interacting electrons and holes , at room temperature .",
    "we thereby remain in the boltzmann regime defined by @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the 2d carrier density , @xmath18 the thermal wavelength and @xmath19 the spin degeneracy of the confined carriers of effective mass @xmath20 . for @xmath21 = 300 k , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath22 @xmath23 for znse - based qws and @xmath24 @xmath23 for gaas - based qws @xcite .    due to spatial confinement of the carriers in qws",
    "the coulombic interaction between electrons and holes is enhanced . however , even at moderate plasma densities carrier - carrier interactions are weakened because of the density - dependent screening .",
    "screening is one of the most important manifestations of the complex many - body interaction in the electron - hole plasma and the simplest approach is the use of the 2d statically screened potential @xcite :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the bessel function ; @xmath27 , in the boltzmann limit , is known as the 2d debye - hckel screening wavenumber ( which depends on temperature and carrier density ) , @xmath28 is the static dielectric constant of the semiconductor and @xmath29 the inter - carrier distance .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) describes the electron - electron and hole - hole repulsion ; the attractive electron - hole potential is obtained by changing the overall sign .",
    "the above integral may also be written in terms of special functions :    @xmath30,\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the neumann and struve functions respectively @xcite .",
    "the total screening is the sum of electron and hole plasma screenings . as such we neglect the weak screening by neutral excitons .      in qws where coulomb forces are enhanced because of the spatial confinement of the electrons and holes , we expect a finite population of coulomb correlated quasi - particles in the plasma even at room temperature .",
    "the balance between those correlations and the free carriers is obtained by calculating the degree of ionization , @xmath5 @xcite :    @xmath33    in the above equation , the total density of a carrier of type @xmath12 is defined as @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the density of free carriers of type @xmath12 and @xmath36 originates from the interaction between carriers of the same type ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) .",
    "when @xmath5 is close to unity , the thermodynamic properties of the electron - hole plasma are those of the ideal gas ( defined by @xmath5 = 1 ) . for lower values of the degree of ionization",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the plasma deviate from those of the ideal gas and coulomb correlations have to be considered .",
    "detailed calculations of the degree of ionization and further discussion on the statistical mechanics of the 2d electron - hole plasma can be found in refs .",
    "here we only stress that the degree of ionization is obtained from the calculation of the partition function of the 2d electron - hole plasma .",
    "scattering state contributions to the partition function have to be considered in addition to the bound - state sum as a proper account of scattering eliminates singularities in thermodynamic properties of the non - ideal 2d gas caused by the emergence of additional bound states as the strength of the attractive potential is increased .",
    "inclusion of the scattering states also leads to a strong deviation from the standard law of mass action .",
    "additionally , note that exchange between carriers within the electron - hole plasma is taken into account in the calculation of the electron - electron and hole - hole parts of the partition function @xcite .",
    "the ionization degrees , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are shown as functions of plasma density @xmath17 on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for gaas and znse quantum - wells at temperature @xmath41 k. in the nondegenerate regime , the function @xmath42 is monotonic whereas @xmath43 exhibits a minimum at low density .",
    "the presence of the minimum is due to the influence of coulomb screening on the density dependence of the ionization degree : at very low density screening is negligible and @xmath44 is proportional to the square of the total plasma density so @xmath5 is a decreasing function of @xmath17 ; however with @xmath17 increasing further , plasma screening becomes more and more important and hence reduces the strength of coulomb correlations so @xmath44 is a decreasing function of @xmath17 and @xmath5 increases .",
    "this density dependence is more dramatic in znse qws where coulomb forces are much stronger than they are in gaas qws .",
    "note that @xmath42 and @xmath43 not only differ qualitatively but also quantitatively : in gaas qws the electron - hole plasma is dominated by free carriers whereas it contains comparable densities of correlations and free carriers in znse qws .",
    "knowledge of the degree of ionization is of great importance as the emission mechanisms depend on the nature of the plasma . for further detail",

    "[ fig4 ] , the direct term is negligible compared to the exchange term .",
    "therefore , the total scattering matrix elements can be very well approximated by the exchange term only in eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) , and the spin configuration becomes irrelevant here , as observed by ramon _",
    "et al _ @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we find that the inclusion of exchange effects in our model reverses the trend that we observed above : the magnitude of @xmath93 has increased dramatically and is now greater than that of @xmath94 .",
    "exchange is therefore the mechanism that makes the @xmath0 scattering a more efficient process than @xmath1 scattering to lead an exciton to the radiative cone where photon emission occurs .",
    "although of importance , exchange effects are indeed reduced for the holes , which are heavier ( 4 times and 7 times the electron effective mass in znse and gaas respectively ) . comparing results",
    "obtained for znse and gaas , it appears clearly that , for a given plasma screening , the contribution of exciton  carrier scattering to the emission rates at room temperature is more important in znse than it is in gaas , whatever the scattering channel is , @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "this is first due to the fact that for a given plasma screening , the plasma density is higher in znse qw than it is in gaas qw ; second , because of a smaller dielectric constant that yields a strong exciton binding energy in znse qws , the exciton population remain important at low and moderate carrier densities ( more than 50 % ) whereas the fraction of excitons in gaas qws remains modest ( less than 20 % ) and hence yield a lower carrier - assisted excitonic contribution to photon emission .",
    "the nature of the mixed exciton / electron - hole plasma is therefore of importance .",
    "we have computed the exciton  electron and exciton  hole scattering matrix elements and discussed their properties .",
    "we have considered the fermionic nature of the carriers through exchange effects , which have been found to be very important even in a dilute mixed exciton / electron - hole plasma at room temperature . in these thermodynamic conditions",
    "the carrier - assisted radiative exciton recombination process has been investigated for gaas - based and znse - based quantum wells . for a given plasma screening , the emission rates due to elastic exciton ",
    "carrier scattering in znse - based qws are found to be one to two orders of magnitude greater than those in gaas qws .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that for the same value of plasma screening , the plasma density is greater in znse qws than it is in gaas qws , but more importantly , because of the lower ionization degree of the znse qws plasma .",
    "we have also found that in both systems the @xmath1 scattering channel is a more efficient one in the case of _ direct _ scattering when the densities of electrons and holes are comparable .",
    "we attribute this essentially to the two - dimensional density of states which is greater for hole than for electron systems .",
    "the direct terms of the scattering matrix elements have been found to be negligible compared to the exchange terms . as a consequence",
    ", fermion exchange favors the @xmath0 scattering channel for the carrier - assisted radiative recombination .",
