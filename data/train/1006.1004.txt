    "nearby star - forming regions at these young ages , as observed , for example , in the orion complex , display a significant fraction of circumstellar disks remaining from the star formation process ( haisch et al .",
    "2001 , hernndez et al .  2007 , and references therein ) .",

    "2008 ) . for comparison , the orion nebula cluster hosts only 2 to 4 o - type stars ( hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "most of our knowledge of the first few million years of stellar evolution and disk depletion stems from nearby star - forming regions of significantly lower density and stellar mass , while the effects of the starburst environment on circumstellar material and the disk lifetime has rarely been probed .    increasing evidence for remnant accretion disks around young , massive ob stars",

    ". the large fraction of near - infrared excess objects and the fact that early o - type stars are on the main sequence suggest very young ages of less than 1 - 2 myr for these environments . observing disk fractions at later evolutionary stages",
    "is complicated by the steeply decreasing disk fraction as clusters age ( haisch et al .  2001 ) , and the decreasing brightness of the increasingly depleted disks themselves . the arches cluster , at an age of @xmath8 myr ( najarro et al .",
    "2004 ) , fills one of the rare gaps in cluster evolution .",
    "not only does it provide an estimate of the disk lifetime in its substantial b - star population , it additionally connects disk survival with the dense environment of a starburst cluster .      in young star - forming regions with ages less than 10 myr ,",
    "@xmath9-band excess provides one of the most efficient tools to detect circumstellar disks ( haisch et al .",
    "2001 , see also hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 , lada et al .",
    "2000 ) . as the illumination of the dense , inner disk rim by the central star generates 3.8@xmath10 m emission from hot dust ( natta et al .",
    "2001 ) , the excess @xmath9-band flux indicates dense disks surviving from the star - formation process . the hostile starburst cluster environment can accelerate disk destruction , to the extent that one might not expect to find any remaining gaseous disks in a cluster like the arches .",
    "the finding of disks provides crucial clues for our understanding of disk survival and the likelyhood of planet formation in dense cluster environments .",
    "a linear decrease is observed in the disk fraction as a function of increasing cluster age in nearby star - forming regions ( haisch et al .",
    "this decrease in near - infrared excess emission can be understood as the depletion of dust in the inner , hot disk rim due to photoevaporation and grain growth ( e.g. , takeuchi et al .",
    ". the lifetimes of young disks , as derived from near - infrared excess fractions , indicate that most disks are depleted within 10 myr , with shorter disk lifetimes for higher mass stars . in a pioneering study of 47 herbig ae",
    "/ be stars , hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found a more rapid depletion of disks around b - type stars with masses of @xmath11 than in a stars in the @xmath12 mass range . on average",
    ", the disks around high - mass stars do not survive for more than 1 myr , with a characteristic disk age of only a few @xmath13 yr ( alonso - albi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "according to disk depletion simulations , the timescale for disk survival is expected to depend on the mass of the central star and on the ambient uv radiation field , and thus on the cluster environment .",
    "however , disk photoevaporation models do not arrive at a consistent conclusion for disk survival times around high - mass stars .",
    "models of disks around high - mass o- and early b - type stars in isolation suggest that while the outer disk is evaporated by the central star on timescales of less than 1 myr , the inner , dense disks with radii of @xmath14 au can survive for several myr in late o - type stars , and more than 20 myr in early b - type stars ( richling & yorke 1997 , hollenbach et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , on the other hand , predict that the dense , inner disk around a herbig ae / be star will be depleted out to a radius of 40 au within 3 myr . in a starburst cluster , the numerous o- and b - type stars additionally create a strong euv / fuv radiation field that accelerates disk evaporation . simulations by armitage ( 2000 ) suggest that a disk with a dust mass of @xmath15 can survive for up to 1 myr in clusters with @xmath16 stars at a distance of 1 pc from the dense core , while the same disk will be evaporated in less than @xmath13 yrs if located at 0.1 - 0.3 pc from the massive stars in the cluster center .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by fatuzzo & adams ( 2008 ) , who simulate the influence of the radiation field on circumstellar disks in a massive star cluster with respect to planetary system formation .",
    "tidal forces during dynamical interactions between cluster members might additionally truncate circumstellar disks ( olczak et al .",
    "2008 , pfalzner et al .",

    "ngc3603 , and similarly dense starburst clusters , the situation may be more extreme than in nearby star - forming regions , as the numerous o - type stars segregate toward the cluster core , where the combined effect of their radiation fields act on circumstellar material around lower - mass cluster members as well .",
    "the radiation environment in starburst clusters therefore has important consequences for the survival timescale of disks , both in the milky way and in extragalactic systems , and thus for the potential of planetary system formation in dense star - forming environments .",
    "in particular , the disk fraction is predicted to be a function of the stellar density in addition to the cluster age .",
    "a lower disk fraction in high - density environments might influence the accretion timescale and final stellar masses , and hence the initial stellar mass function .",
    "observationally , the effect of the ambient stellar density can be evidenced as a depletion of circumstellar disks towards the dense cluster core , where the most massive stars reside . a decrease in the disk fraction with decreasing cluster radius",

    "two fainter natural guide stars with @xmath29 mag were used as tip - tilt reference sources , located @xmath30 from the center of each field .",
    "the adaptive optics performance was strongly dependent on the observing wavelength and on nightly atmospheric conditions .",
    "the average strehl ratios were 0.15 in @xmath31 , 0.27 in @xmath2 , and 0.64 in @xmath1 . a @xmath2 mosaic of the five @xmath0 fields is illustrated in fig .  [ mosaic ] , and field positions and tip - tilt star offsets",
    "are provided in table  [ fieldtab ] .",
    "a summary of the observations , including the observational details , the number of frames entering each final combined image , as well as the resulting strehl ratios and spatial resolutions , can be found in table  [ obstab ] .",
    "the images were reduced with our nirc2 python / pyraf pipeline ( lu et al .",
    "2009 ) , which includes dark and flatfield correction , sky subtraction , the removal of nirc2 bad pixels and cosmic rays , and distortion correction ( thompson et al .",
    "2001 ) prior to image combination .",
    "ten separate sky frames were observed in each filter at the end of each 3 hour arches observing block . from these open - loop , star - free exposures ,",
    "a median sky frame was created for each filter , which was scaled to the median background value of each individual exposure prior to subtraction . in @xmath1 ,",
    "a special procedure was employed to additionally account for structured thermal background caused by the keck ii field rotator mirror .",
    "residual background structure was minimized by observing sky frames at the same rotator mirror angle as the science observations .",
    "skies were taken with rotator angle increments of two degrees , and median skies were averaged from three adjacent rotator angle positions .",
    "we also note that the best performance is achieved in @xmath1 when sky frames are taken close in time to the observations .",
    "when sky frames were observed within one hour of our @xmath1 targets , the photometric sensitivity in the reduced images was typically 0.5 mag deeper than on the images observed earlier during the same night .",
    "strehl ratios and full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) values of the point - spread function ( psf ) were derived for each individual image during the pipeline reduction . in observing sequences with less than 20 frames , all frames with closed - loop ao correction",
    "were combined into the final image . in observing sequences with more than 20 frames , frame selection to enhance the spatial resolution was possible without compromising photometric depth . in these sequences , only frames with @xmath32 were included in the final image , where @xmath33 was the minimum @xmath34 achieved in the sequence for each field and filter .",
    "this rejection criterion typically removed between 10% of the images under stable atmospheric conditions and 30% of the images in the case of variable seeing and ao performance prior to image combination .",
    "when frame selection was applied , the selected images were weighted by the strehl ratio to enhance the resolution on the combined image .",
    "after the standard reduction procedures , the drizzle algorithm was used to combine the images to preserve the original resolution and to achieve the maximum sensitivity on the co - added image ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .    relative photometry was extracted using the starfinder algorithm ( diolaiti et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is designed to fit an empirical psf to crowded stellar fields .",
    "the code has the advantage of creating an empirical 2-dimensional psf by averaging several isolated sources , such that the extracted psf is independent of fitted analytical functions .",
    "this is particularly crucial , as the keck ao psf can not be characterized by azimuthally symmetric functions . the emploid version of the code is limited to non - spatially varying psfs .",
    "the radial extent of the psf was set for each field and filter by the radius where the psf structure was dominated by background noise , and is listed in tab .",
    "[ obstab ] . in the cluster core",
    ", @xmath35 sufficiently bright and isolated sources could be found to define the average psf . in the east fields ( see fig .  [ mosaic ] ) , the rapidly decreasing density of bright stars limited the psf template selection to 5 - 7 sources on field east1 , and 3 - 5 sources on east2 .",
    "the final psf for each field was created iteratively after selection and subtraction of neighboring sources from each image .",
    "three iterations were performed before the final psf was extracted .",
    "the average empirical psf then served as the template to fit simultaneous photometry for all sources in each frame .",
    "in addition to the deep , combined images , the reduced frames were divided into three qualitatively comparable subsets and combined into three auxiliary images to estimate the photometric and astrometric uncertainties .",
    "the auxiliary frames are composed from the list of all selected images sorted by strehl ratio . from this quality - sorted list ,",
    "every third frame enters auxiliary frames 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , to ensure the same quality in all three auxiliary frames .",
    "the random dither pattern with three images per pointing position and small dither offsets additionally ensures that image distortions are sampled in the same way in all three auxiliary frames .",
    "starfinder positions and photometry were derived for point sources on the auxiliary images in the same way as for the deep data sets . as a first pass at rejecting faint , spurious detections caused by the varying halo structure of the psf or fluctuations in the background",
    ", sources in @xmath31 and @xmath2 were required to be detected in at least one auxiliary frame in addition to the deep image in order to be included in the final photometry table .",
    "in addition , the auxiliary frames were used to estimate the photometric and astrometric uncertainties . in @xmath31 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by crowding effects .",
    "the photometry of stars near bright sources is sensitive to the strehl ratio of each image , and hence their individual measurements on the three auxiliary images vary more than for isolated sources .",
    "this crowding effect is not evident in the photometric uncertainties delivered during psf fitting by starfinder , but is well reproduced in the rms uncertainties from repeated measurements on the auxiliary images .",
    "the astrometric and photometric uncertainties , shown in figs .  [ photuncer ] and [ posuncer ] , are derived from the standard deviation ( rms ) of the positions and fluxes on the auxiliary images and the main image , and hence from the repeatability of each measurement . in @xmath1 ,",
    "residual thermal background emission caused the sensitivity of the auxiliary images to be significantly lower than the sensitivity of the deep image , such that @xmath1 uncertainties are most affected by spatial sensitivity variations and not by crowding .",
    "the limited photometric sensitivity of the auxiliary frames restricted the number of @xmath1 sources matched with the photometry of the @xmath31 and @xmath2 images . with the goal of including the fainter @xmath1 sources detected only in the deep combined image in the final catalogue , all @xmath1 starfinder detections were matched with the @xmath36 photometric table .",
    "when sources were detected in the auxiliary frames , the @xmath1 photometric uncertainties were derived from the standard deviation of the repeated measurements . for faint sources",
    "not detected in the auxiliary frames , the starfinder signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was used to estimate the photometric uncertainty . as psf fitting does not account for background fluctuations , the starfinder s / n still appears to underestimate the photometric uncertainty in some cases .",
    "a comparison of the rms photometric uncertainties derived from the auxiliary frames and the starfinder s / n indicates that the starfinder s / n may underestimate the true @xmath1 photometric uncertainty by up to a factor of 4 .",
    "these smaller uncertainties have a negligible effect on the final photometric uncertainty of each source , which is dominated by the uncertainty in the zeropoint ( see table  [ zpttab ] ) .",
    "the final @xmath0 table thus contains as many sources as possible , while avoiding @xmath1 artefacts with the requirement that any @xmath1 source be detected in all three filters .",
    "this procedure resulted in a clean list of 380 @xmath0 detections and 1033 additional @xmath36 detections for the two - color analysis ( table [ fulltable ] ) .",
    "the @xmath36 photometry was calibrated with reference to the vlt / naos - conica ( naco ) observations obtained in 2002 ( stolte et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 , see also stolte et al .",
    "2008 ) , covering a @xmath37 fov around the cluster center with a spatial resolution similar to the keck / nirc2 observations ( tab .",
    "[ obstab ] ) .",
    "the absolute calibration zeropoint for the naco photometry is provided by lower resolution ( @xmath38 ) hst / nicmos calibrations presented in figer et al .",
    "five available 2mass sources were used to check that the calibration with respect to the nicmos filter system did not display systematic offsets with respect to the standard 2mass @xmath39 system . as in our previous work ,",
    "no color terms were found ( fig .",
    "[ colorterms ] ) . in order to verify that the use of a spatially invariant psf did not alter the photometric performance across the field",
    ", photometric residuals were tested independently in the x , y and radial directions .",
    "a possible weak zeropoint variation of less than @xmath40 mag , comparable to the standard deviation of @xmath41 mag in @xmath2 and @xmath42 mag in @xmath31 in a sample of 76 calibration sources , may be present over the maximum radial extent of @xmath43 in the nirc2 @xmath31 and @xmath2 data sets when compared to both nicmos and naco , but the linear fit indicates less than one sigma significance . as the variance is within our formal zeropoint uncertainties ( table  [ zpttab ] )",
    ", we apply a constant zeropoint across the field . with increasing distance from the field center ,",
    "anisoplanatic effects are expected to affect the natural guide star observations with naco most severely , while more modest effects are expected for the keck lgs observations since the artificial guide star was pointed at the center of each @xmath44 field of view .",
    "this may explain the slight differences of 0.03 - 0.10 between the zeropoints of the nirc2-nirc2 and the nirc2-naco calibrations . in order to achieve a uniform photometric calibration across the nirc2 mosaic area ,",
    "we therefore apply a two - step correction process .",
    "first , absolute photometric calibration is obtained for the central core region from the comparison with naco , and relative calibration of fields at larger distances from the guide star is then derived with respect to the cluster core .",
    "the core field is close to the guide star used both as the natural gs with naco and as the tip - tilt source with nirc2 , such that anisoplanatic effects at increasing guide star distances are minimized ( see fig .",
    "[ mosaic ] ) . for the core field , we use only the innermost @xmath45 region within @xmath46 nirc2 pixels to calibrate against naco @xmath39 .",
    "the high stellar density in this area provides 56 sources with @xmath47 and @xmath48 mag for the absolute calibration , and zeropoint variations over this small area were confirmed to be negligible .",
    "the zeropoint offsets of the adjacent fields , `` east1 '' and `` lead '' were derived with respect to the calibrated core field , and `` east2 '' and the intermediate proper motion field `` east1.5 '' were calibrated against `` east1 '' ( see table [ zpttab ] ) . only sources with relative photometric uncertainties @xmath49 mag , as derived from the auxiliary images ( see above ) , were used as calibration sources .",
    "the halo field does not overlap with the core field , but its proximity to the guide star ensures that anisoplanatic effects are avoided .",
    "hence , the halo field @xmath36 photometry was calibrated against the naco field .",
    "the average zeropoints after airmass correction were 25.219 in @xmath31 , 24.578 in @xmath2 .      in @xmath1 , where no previous data exist , absolute calibration was achieved using @xmath1 observations of the central parsec in the galactic center ( gc ) , where numerous previous long - wavelength observations are available ( see appendix , tab .",
    "[ gctab ] , and for reference , see also blum et al .  1996 , clnet et al .  2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "the central parsec was observed during the same night and at the same airmass as the arches core field .",
    "the surrounding arches fields were subsequently calibrated relative to the core field .",
    "the same observational setup was employed for both the arches and the gc observations .",
    "taking into account airmass variations , we first derived the zeropoint for the gc data by referencing against calibrated ngsao observations reported in appendix a. the final calibration was confirmed by matching with both the blum and clnet tables .",
    "this procedure ensures that the zeropoint offset between the @xmath1 ( @xmath50 ) , used by clnet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and for our data , and the @xmath9 ( @xmath51 ) filter used in blum et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was accounted for .",
    "the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath1 is a constant offset in this case , as sources in the gc sample as well as in the arches cluster have comparable line of sight extinctions ( see appendix b for details on the filter differences and the extinction law ) . as well as @xmath1 , such that they could not be used as calibration sources . ]",
    "the uncertainty in the zeropoint was estimated from variations of the zeropoints of individual images throughout the observation sequence .",
    "the derived gc @xmath1 zeropoint of @xmath52 mag was used to calculate magnitudes for the arches core field after airmass correction .",
    "possible temperature or atmospheric variations leading to a varying thermal or sky background during the two hours of @xmath1 observations cause the remaining uncertainty of 0.10 mag in the zeropoint .",
    "when the calibrated photometry was compared to the location of the reddening vector in the @xmath53 two - color diagram , the majority of sources was located below the reddening line .",
    "this is unexpected , as the cluster population is dominated by main sequence stars , and the field population is dominated by field giants .",
    "the intrinsic colors of main sequence stars are close to zero in the standard magnitude system , such that the reddening vector also passes through the origin in the two - color diagram , and main sequence stars behind substantial foreground extinction , such as the arches members , are expected to scatter around this vector according to their photometric uncertainties . a shift of @xmath54 mag allowed for both cluster stars and background sources in the arches field to follow the extinction vector ( see sec .  [ lsec ] below ) , as expected .",
    "such a zeropoint shift can be explained by the difference in the average extinction between the gc calibration sources , @xmath55 mag and arches cluster members , @xmath56 mag . @xmath57",
    "mag corresponds to a difference of @xmath58 mag when calibrating @xmath1 with respect to @xmath9 data ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "this offset is , however , also consistent with the zeropoint variation across the two hour @xmath1 gc observing sequence due to thermal background variations across the night . as",
    "the offset is within the zeropoint uncertainties , it was applied to the absolute @xmath1 calibration .",
    "all adjacent images were calibrated with respect to the core , and as in the case of @xmath36 , the zeropoint uncertainties were calculated based on the standard deviations of the photometric residuals of the calibration sources after the zeropoint was applied . in the halo field , four @xmath1 acquisition exposures with total exposure times of 30s each were obtained with one third of the acquisition images overlapping the core field , and two thirds overlapping the lower - density halo field .",
    "the acquisition exposures were combined to provide a calibration field for the halo field @xmath1 photometry .",
    "the zeropoint of the acquisition image was obtained with respect to the core , and the halo field was calibrated with respect to the acquisition image , consecutively .",
    "the reported systematic zeropoint uncertainty in @xmath1 for this field is comprised of the standard deviations of the photometric residuals of the acquisition and halo fields .",
    "zeropoint uncertainties are estimated from the standard deviation in the photometric residuals of calibration sources after the zeropoint was applied ( table [ zpttab ] ) , and are included as systematic uncertainties in all reported photometric uncertainties .",
    "where several fields had to be used consecutively to obtain the absolute zeropoint , the standard deviations from each field were added in quadrature to obtain the final zeropoint uncertainty .",

    "the finding of disks in the arches b - star population is unexpected for two reasons .",

    "the @xmath31-band brightness of the disk - bearing stars suggests that the majority are b - type stars . as the characteristic uv evaporation timescale of a primordial disk around herbig",
    "be stars is less than 1 myr ( alonso - albi et al .",
    "2009 ) , a disk lifetime of 2.5 myr for b - type stars implies that the disks had to be massive initially .",
    "secondly , disk destruction is expected to be accelerated in a starburst cluster environment .",
    "the extreme uv radiation from numerous o - stars adds to the evaporation by the disk host star . at a density of @xmath152 , interactions cause additional tidal truncation especially of the extended outer disks ( olczak et al .",
    "2006 ) , which in turn enhances the exposure of the inner disk to the cluster radiation field .",
    "the detection of optically thick disks with substantial @xmath9-band excesses close to the cluster center suggests that the disk - bearing sources have migrated into the sphere of influence of the central o - type stars only recently , or are viewed in projection toward the cluster center .",
    "the radial increase of the disk fraction toward larger cluster center distances evidences the influence of the radiation field and high stellar density in the cluster core on primordial disks .",
    "speculatively , one can envision a scenario wherein disk - bearing stars migrate inward during the mass segregation process and once close to the cluster center lose their disks rapidly .",
    "taking into account that some of the core sources might be in front of or behind the cluster center , the very low excess fraction of only 3% in the cluster core is already an upper limit to the disk fraction inside the core radius of 0.2 pc .",
    "the disk fraction of 10% for stars with @xmath161 ( 0.28 pc ) in the _ same stellar mass range _ provides stringent evidence that the starburst cluster environment enhances the depletion of primordial disks as soon as their orbital motion moves disk - bearing stars close to the cluster center . in the future ,",
    "the increasing proper motion accuracy might provide trajectories of these sources to understand their orbital motion in the cluster .    from observations of lower - mass star - forming regions",
    ", we might expect an increase in the disk fraction towards stars with later types , such as afg stars .",
    "if the same processes dominated disk destruction in a starburst cluster , a substantial increase in the disk fraction in fields with deeper @xmath9-band observations should be observed , which is not the case .",
    "for instance , in the leading field with a peak in the luminosity function of @xmath162 mag , the same number of 5 excess sources is observed as in the shallower east1 and core fields with @xmath1 peak luminosities of only 13.5 and 14.0 mag . if the disk fraction would mostly be determined by the uv evaporation from the b - type host stars , then the deeper detection limit in the leading field should yield a significantly larger fraction of disks than the shallower fields , especially when compared to the east1 field with similar stellar density .",
    "the fact that an increase in the disk fraction towards fainter stars seems not to be observed in the arches cluster strengthens the interpretation that the starburst environment affects disk survival .",
    "it appears that stars later than b lose their disks more rapidly in a starburst cluster environment than in moderate star - forming regions , indicating that the influence of the ambient uv radiation field and encounters indeed shorten the disk survival timescale .    in fig .",

    "the herbig be star disks were shifted to the distance and foreground extinction of the arches cluster .",

    "the finding of significantly different disk fractions for high- and low - mass stars ( 80% for low - mass stars with @xmath163 , 42% for oba stars ) in this study corroborates the dependence of the disk depletion timescale on the mass of the central star .",

    "the possibility of survival of dense , inner disks around b - type stars up to ages of 10 myr was also predicted theoretically from hydrodynamic simulations taking into account various levels of photoevaporation , disk - stellar wind interaction , mass loss from disk winds , and the evaporative depletion by nearby o stars ( richling & yorke 2000 , see hollenbach et al .",
