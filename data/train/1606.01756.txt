    "a question raised in one of the first papers on the rotor - router walk ( introduced originally under the name `` eulerian walkers model '' @xcite ) concerned the shape and size of the cluster of sites visited by the walker till time @xmath0 .",
    "the finite - time behavior of the rotor walk on an infinite lattice is a much more difficult problem than the recurrent rotor walk on a finite graph which admits a theoretical treatment due to the abelian structure similar to that in the sandpile model @xcite ( see @xcite for more references ) .",
    "heuristic arguments used in @xcite showed that , given a uniform random initial configuration of rotors on the infinite square lattice , the average cluster of visited sites is roughly a disc of radius @xmath1 which grows as @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of circular shape appears also in the model of rotor aggregation introduced by propp @xcite . in this model ,",
    "@xmath3 particles starting at the origin perform rotor - router walk until reaching an unoccupied lattice site which then becomes occupied .",
    "levine and peres @xcite proved that for @xmath4-dimensional lattice the asymptotic shape of the set of occupied sites is an euclidean ball .",
    "the shape of the cluster of sites visited by a single rotor walker is another problem .",
    "in contrast to the rotor aggregation where each particle finishes its trajectory at the first unoccupied site , the single rotor walk continues its motion permanently modifying the rotor configuration .",
    "then , an additional essential problem appears on the number of returns of the rotor walk to the origin .",
    "recently , florescu , levine and peres @xcite have proved that the number of distinct sites visited by the rotor - router walk on @xmath4-dimensional lattice in @xmath0 steps is greater or equal @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a positive constant . particularly for @xmath7 , this statement gives a tight lower - bound of the law @xmath2 for the growth of the average linear size of a two - dimensional cluster , but leaves aside the question of its asymptotic form .",
    "kapri and dhar @xcite used extensive numerical simulations to study the shape of the rotor - router cluster formed by an eulerian walk on a random background in two dimensions and presented evidence that it converges to a perfect circle for large number of steps .",
    "further attempts to describe the structure of the cluster of visited sites were made in @xcite .",
    "the motion of the rotor - router walker creates a sequence of loops of rotors and a set of labeled sites where the loops become closed . in the case",
    "when the rule of clockwise rotations is applied to all rotors , the sequence of labeled sites forms a spiral - like structure which was conjectured to tend asymptotically to the _ archimedean spiral _ in average @xcite .",
    "the archimedean property is consistent with the perfect circular asymptotic shape of the cluster of visited sites .",
    "also , it agrees with a scaling law for the number of visits to a site separated from the origin by distance @xmath8 for @xmath9 steps of the walker @xcite .",
    "while the circular shape of the rotor - router cluster is approved at least numerically , the fluctuations of this shape are more resistant to a clear description .",
    "a standard approach to investigation of fluctuations of a growing surface implies a formulation in terms of the kpz theory @xcite .",
    "kapri and dhar @xcite calculated the width @xmath10 of the surface region of the rotor - router cluster on the square lattice to determine the saturation - width exponent @xmath11 and the dynamical exponent @xmath12 in the kpz scaling law @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a characteristic length of the surface , and @xmath15 is the scaling function which behaves as @xmath16 for @xmath17 and tends to 1 for @xmath18 @xcite . since for the growing two - dimensional cluster of radius @xmath1 ,",
    "both time @xmath0 and length @xmath14 are proportional to @xmath1 , the expected kpz values @xmath19 and @xmath20 lead to asymptotic law @xmath21 .",
    "the exponent @xmath22 obtained in @xcite was estimated as @xmath23 .",
    "this value of @xmath22 is consistent with the kpz exponents although it was difficult to control its limiting behavior .",
    "a non - controlling influence of shape fluctuations can be seen also in a slow convergence of the spiral structure to the proposed archimedean law @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for these difficulties is a lack of the stationary state for fluctuations of the boundary of the radially growing cluster and an unrestricted growth of the boundary region @xmath10 which stands in contrast to an expected stationary regime for the infinitely long cylinder .",
    "singha @xcite compared surface fluctuations in growing clusters on the plane and those in the cylindrical geometry where width @xmath10 tends to a constant .",
    "the comparison showed quite different behavior of fluctuations in two geometries : the auto - correlation function tends with time to a non - zero value for the plane and decays to zero for the long cylinder .",
    "an obvious advantage of the cylindrical geometry is the explicit separation of variables @xmath14 and @xmath0 in the scaling law ( [ kpz ] ) instead of their merging to single variable @xmath1 in the plane geometry .",
    "this allows to investigate the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath14 and large @xmath0 separately . as to detailed properties of the growing clusters",
    ", we may expect more regular behavior of the spiral structure which should be converted into a regular helix in the cylindrical case .    in this paper , we consider the rotor - router walk on a semi - infinite cylinder of square lattice with a boundary of perimeter @xmath14 .",
    "rotors are considered as arrows attached to each lattice site and directed toward one of four neighbors on the lattice .",
    "arrows at the boundary sites have three possible directions .",
    "a particle called usually _ chip _ , performs a walk jumping from a site to its neighbor along the current direction of rotor in the site . arriving to a given site",
    ", the chip rotates the arrow 90 degrees clockwise and moves toward the site pointed by new direction of the arrow . on the boundary , the arrow pointed clockwise with respect to the top of the cylinder turns 180 degrees and becomes pointed anticlockwise .",
    "imposing special initial directions of rotors on @xmath14 boundary sites and random initial directions in the remaining lattice we provide a uniform propagation of the cluster of visited sites downward from the top of the vertically oriented semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "then the asymptotic average boundary of the growing cluster is flat and the non - trivial shape problem vanishes .",
    "the average width @xmath10 of the surface region evolves with time to its stationary value presumably by the kpz law ( [ kpz ] ) .",
    "a check of the scaling form of @xmath24 and determination of the related exponents is the first goal of the present paper .",
    "another goal is an analysis of the internal structure of the growing clusters .",
    "there are plenty of models demonstrating the local growth mechanism and kinetic roughening phenomena , for instance , random and ballistic deposition , the eden model , rsos models and polymer growth ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the growth of the cluster of visited sites generated by the rotor walk has some peculiarities .",
    "florescu , levine and peres @xcite defined an _ excursion _ from the origin @xmath25 as the rotor walk started at @xmath25 and runs until it returns to @xmath25 exactly once from each of the neighboring sites .",
    "the cluster appearing at the end of each excursion consists of rotors oriented towards the boundary of cylinder .",
    "these rotors are directed edges of a graph which is a forest of trees attached to the boundary sites .",
    "each excursion adds to the forest additional branches .",
    "the accumulation of edges is accompanied by a coarse - grained accumulation of domains formed by loops of rotors , in particular the clockwise closed contours .",
    "the latter process imposes a larger scale of the fluctuations of growing surface and is responsible for the asymptotic values of the sought exponents .    beside the clusters of visited sites , we consider spiral structures introduced in previous papers @xcite .",
    "the site , where the chip completes a next clockwise contour , was called _",
    "label_. we have noticed in @xcite that the sequence of labels forms a spiral structure in the case of plane geometry . after averaging over initial random configurations of rotors , the sequence approaches asymptotically the archimedean spiral . in the cylinder geometry , the spiral should be converted into a cylindrical helix .",
    "the determination of its parameters and examination of the convergence to the limiting form is the concluding part of the work .",
    "let @xmath26 be an infinite directed graph whose vertices @xmath27 are sites of a semi - infinite cylinder of square lattice with a boundary @xmath28 of perimeter @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the set of outgoing edges of site @xmath30 .",
    "it consists of four outgoing edges @xmath31 for bulk sites @xmath32 and of three outgoing edges @xmath33 for boundary sites @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , @xmath35 for the bulk sites and @xmath36 for the boundary sites . a rotor configuration is defined as a collection of outgoing edges @xmath37 from every site of the lattice .",
    "we assume that elements of both the bulk and the boundary sets @xmath29 are ordered locally clockwise .",
    "a chip - and - rotor state @xmath38 is a pair consisting of a vertex @xmath39 which represents the location of the chip and a rotor configuration @xmath40 .",
    "the rotor - router walk is a sequence of chip - and - rotor states @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 . at each step @xmath44 of discrete time @xmath0 ,",
    "the chip arriving to site @xmath45 , changes the position of rotor @xmath46 to @xmath47 where index @xmath48 is changed as @xmath49 if the vertex @xmath50 is in bulk and @xmath51 if the vertex @xmath50 is on the boundary .",
    "then , the chip moves to the neighboring site of @xmath50 pointed by the new position of the rotor .",
    "the motion of the chip is determined by the initial chip - and - rotor state @xmath41 .",
    "we denote boundary sites @xmath52 by numbers @xmath53 .",
    "the initial rotor configuration @xmath54 consists of specifically chosen boundary rotors @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the randomly chosen rotor configuration @xmath54 for @xmath32 .",
    "a general aim is a characterization of rotor states @xmath57 for @xmath58 and description of clusters of sites visited by the rotor walk .    given a rotor state , we say that a group of rotors outgoing from sites @xmath59 forms a directed path if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are neighbors for all @xmath62 and the rotor at @xmath60 is directed toward @xmath61 . the directed path of rotors becomes a cycle if @xmath63 .",
    "a shortest possible cycle consists of two adjacent sites @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which are connected by a pair of edges from @xmath64 to @xmath65 and back .",
    "we call such cycles _ dimers _ by analogy with lattice dimers covering two neighboring sites . a cycle formed by more than two edges",
    "is called _",
    "contour_. if rotors belonging the contour are oriented clockwise , we call it the clockwise contour .",
    "the clockwise or anticlockwise directions depend on an orientation of the surface .",
    "below , we will fix the orientation of the surface by the mapping of the cylinder onto the two - dimensional annulus .",
    "we use two technical tools for analysis of the structure of growing clusters of visited sites .",
    "they are : a selection of clockwise contours among the rotor configurations @xcite , and a representation of the recurrent rotor - router walk as a sequence of excursions @xcite .",
    "a special role of clockwise contours follows from a property of the chip - and - rotor states proved in @xcite and called _",
    "week reversibility_. a precise formulation of this property is given as theorem 2 in @xcite .",
    "here we need a reduced form of theorem 2 and its corollary , which can be formulated as follows .",
    "_ proposition 1_. let @xmath66 be the clockwise contour on a planar graph consisting of vertices @xmath67 ordered anticlockwise and containing an arbitrary rotor configuration inside allowing a recurrent rotor walk .",
    "the rotor - router operation is applied to the chip at @xmath68 and continues until the moment when the chip returns to @xmath69 and the rotor @xmath70 on the contour is made oriented anticlockwise .",
    "then all rotors on @xmath66 are becoming oriented anticlockwise and the moments @xmath71 when the rotors at @xmath67 become anticlockwise for the first time are ordered as @xmath72 .",
    "_ remark_. the semi - infinite cylinder can be considered topologically as a planar annulus .",
    "then , the recurrence of the rotor configurations in the proposition 1 guarantees that any rotor walk started at a contour enveloping the cylinder returns to the contour .",
    "the proof of the first part of the proposition 1 is shared with that of theorem 2 in @xcite while the second part is proved as corollary @xcite .",
    "( a ) the chip trajectory between vertices @xmath8 and @xmath73 .",
    "the closed circles denote vertices where cycles become closed .",
    "( b ) the resulting configuration of rotors at the moment when the chip reaches vertex @xmath73 .",
    "the bold line denotes a backbone of the resulting tree .",
    "arrows show orientations of branches formed by rotors.,width=491 ]    figure [ loops ] shows how proposition 1 works .",
    "consider a chip trajectory between vertices @xmath8 and @xmath73 in fig.[loops](a ) . at moment @xmath74",
    ", the chip visits the vertex denoted by 1 where the first clockwise contour becomes closed .",
    "the chip enters the contour , reverses its orientation into anticlockwise by theorem 1 and leaves vertex 1 in left direction at moment @xmath75 .",
    "due to proposition 1 , we can replace the steps between @xmath74 and @xmath75 by the single operation of reversion of orientation of the first contour .",
    "the next two vertices where closed cycles appear are 2 and 3 .",
    "the both corresponding cycles are dimers . leaving dimers , the chip forms the anticlockwise contour of vertices 1,2,3,4 and leaves it in vertex 4 at the next step .",
    "then , the trajectory continues up to vertex 5 where the second clockwise contour becomes closed at moment @xmath76 .",
    "the chip leaves this contour at @xmath77 and we again skip the steps between @xmath76 and @xmath77 reversing the orientation of the contour .",
    "continuing , the chip closes the dimer cycle in vertex 6 , the anticlockwise contour in 7 , the dimer cycle in 8 and finally reaches vertex @xmath73 .",
    "the configuration of rotors obtained as a result of the chip motion from @xmath8 to @xmath73 is shown in fig.[loops](b ) .",
    "since all cycles were opened during the rotor walk , the resulting configuration is a tree .",
    "vertices @xmath8 and @xmath73 appear to be connected by a line which can be considered as a backbone of the tree .",
    "thus , a complicated trajectory of the rotor - router walk can be represented as a directed path and a collection of tree branches attached to the path .",
    "the backbone of the graph generated by the rotor - router walk can be compared with the loop erased random walk ( lerw ) introduced by lawler @xcite . like the lerw ,",
    "the rotor backbone avoids closed loop and , after sufficiently large number of steps , can be considered as a `` chemical path '' of the resulting spanning tree .",
    "however , the spanning tree whose chemical path corresponds to the lerw is so called _ uniform _ spanning tree @xcite and this chemical path has the fractal dimension @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we will see below that the spanning tree generated by the single rotor walk in a finite volume is not uniform . for a large volume , the fractal dimension of its chemical path @xmath79 as it follows from numerical simulations .",
    "a rigorous proof of @xmath79 is still absent .",
    "the second tool we use below is the decomposition of the rotor walk into excursions .",
    "the definition of excursions given in @xcite reads : fix a vertex @xmath80 .",
    "an excursion from @xmath25 is a rotor walk started at @xmath25 and run until it returns to @xmath25 exactly @xmath81 times .",
    "lemma 2.4 in @xcite states the following properties of excursions .",
    "( i )  if time of @xmath82-th excursion is finite , the number of visits of site @xmath8 during this excursion does not exceed @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "( ii )  let @xmath85 be the set of sites visited during @xmath3-th excursion .",
    "then the number of visits of site @xmath8 during @xmath82-th excursion is @xmath83 for all @xmath86 .",
    "( iii )   @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the set of all vertices neighboring to @xmath85 and not belonging to @xmath85 .",
    "since each excursion is a closed path , the backbone either collapses into a single point , if the backbone path on the lattice is contractible , or becomes a non - contractible loop enveloping the cylinder in the case of cylindrical geometry . in what follows , we consider the latter case imposing a specific initial conditions on the top boundary of the cylinder .",
    "consider the initial rotor configuration @xmath54 shown in fig.[cyl ] .",
    "all boundary rotors @xmath55 , @xmath56 are oriented anticlockwise .",
    "the bulk rotors are chosen randomly with equal probabilities for four possible directions @xmath31 .",
    "the bulk rotors near boundary can be combined to form a forest of oriented trees attached by their roots to the boundary . if there are no rotors directed to a given boundary vertex , the tree consists of the root alone .",
    "we put the initial position of the chip @xmath89 to site @xmath90 and consider evolution of the chip - and - rotor state @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 in discrete time .     semi - infinite cylinder .",
    "arrows at boundary sites denote rotors directed anticlockwise in the initial rotor configuration .",
    "arrows at bulk sites denote rotors constituting trees attached to the boundary .",
    ", width=245 ]    the rotor walk is called _ recurrent _ if it visits the initial vertex infinitely many times , otherwise it is _ transient _ @xcite . if the initial configuration @xmath54 has an infinite path to initial vertex 1 , then the walk is transient @xcite .",
    "below , we need the recurrence property , then we assume that all random trees oriented to the boundary are finite , because otherwise they contain an infinite path .",
    "the surface of the semi - infinite cylinder is equivalent topologically to a two - dimensional annulus whose internal ring coincides with the top boundary of the cylinder and the external ring is situated at infinite distance from the internal one .",
    "the anticlockwise direction of rotors in fig.[cyl ] corresponds to the clockwise orientation of the internal ring against the surface of the annulus .",
    "the external ring is not reachable for the recurrent rotor walk , so its orientation does not matter .",
    "then the initial rotor configuration @xmath54 meets the conditions of proposition 1 and we can assert after @xmath3 steps the existence of a chip - and - rotor state @xmath91 where all boundary rotors changed their orientation to opposite for the first time .    during the next @xmath14 steps @xmath92 , the chip moving along the boundary rotates the boundary rotors at @xmath93 one by one so that at @xmath94-th step the boundary rotors return to the initial positions and the chip is in the vertex 1 .",
    "the sequence of steps from the first to @xmath94-th fits the definition of excursion given in @xcite .",
    "denote the time when the first excursion is completed by @xmath95 .",
    "lemma 2.2 in @xcite claims that if @xmath95 is finite and there is a directed path of initial rotors from vertex @xmath8 to the origin 1 , then the rotor at @xmath8 performs the full rotation .",
    "therefore , we come to an important conclusion : given a forest of trees attached to the boundary in the initial rotor configuration @xmath54 , the first excursion produces a new configuration @xmath96 which contains the rotors of the initial forest at the same positions as in @xmath54 .    proposition 1",
    "allows us to say more about results of the first excursion .",
    "consider a vertex @xmath97 which is visited by the chip during the first excursion but does not belong to the initial boundary forest . since the chip returns to the origin , there is a rotor configuration @xmath57 at step @xmath0 , @xmath98 where @xmath30 belongs to a contour @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath99 is clockwise , it will be open after reversing by proposition 1 ; if @xmath99 is anticlockwise or it is a dimer , it will be open at next step @xmath100 . in all cases",
    "@xmath30 will belong to a branch attached to the initial boundary forest .",
    "therefore , during the first excursion the initial forest will be augmented by new branches containing all visited vertices not belonging to the initial forest .",
    "in particular , all vertices separated from the initial boundary trees by distance 1 are connected to them after the first excursion due to the rotor rotation rule .",
    "the moments of time when new branches are attached to the trees rooted at @xmath53 are strictly ordered : no new branches are attached to @xmath101-th tree , @xmath102 , until the replenishing of the @xmath103-th tree is completed .",
    "indeed , the second part of proposition 1 claims that the moments @xmath104 when the rotors at @xmath53 reverse their direction are ordered as @xmath105 .",
    "any contour producing a branch of @xmath103-th tree should be closed before @xmath106 and a new branch can be added to @xmath101-th tree only after the moment when the chip enters the boundary site @xmath101 i.e. later than @xmath106 .",
    "the next excursions act similarly .",
    "properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the excursions allow to consider each new excursion in the same way as the first one with a given initial rotor configuration .",
    "the rotor configuration @xmath107 obtained after @xmath3-th excursion contains the same ( anticlockwise ) rotors at boundary vertices @xmath53 and differs from @xmath54 by the size of forest only .",
    "each excursion adds new branches to the existing trees , so that the forest of trees attached to the boundary grows monotonically .",
    "if after some excursion a tree appears which has no free neighboring vertices not visited by the rotor walk during previous excursions , then the growth of the tree stops . actually , for a sufficiently large number of excursions and finite @xmath14 , a single tree remains which continues its growth , whereas remaining @xmath108 trees are surrounded by branches of neighboring trees .",
    "we can conclude that , given an arbitrary height @xmath109 of the part of cylinder , there is a number of excursions @xmath110 after which there are no free vertices with the vertical coordinate @xmath111 , so that the obtained forest spans the lattice restricted by height @xmath109 .",
    "in two forthcoming sections , we consider statistical properties of a boundary of the forest and an internal structure of the cluster of sites visited by the rotor walk .",
    "starting with a recurrent initial configuration @xmath54 , the rotor walk generates a forest which covers all sites visited for time @xmath0 .",
    "the surface of the forest is the set of visited sites which have at least one neighboring site not belonging to the forest . for each vertex @xmath97",
    ", we define the height @xmath112 as a vertical distance of @xmath30 from the boundary of the cylinder .",
    "the average height of the surface @xmath113 at moment of time @xmath0 is the average of @xmath112 over all surface sites .",
    "the average number of visited sites is proportional to @xmath114 , so we have for the velocity of growth @xmath115 this implies that for large time @xmath0 @xmath116    the time variable @xmath0 needs some elaboration .",
    "the most natural representation of the discrete time is the number of steps @xmath117 of the rotor - router walk .",
    "however , the evolution of surface @xmath113 proceeds in a coarsened scale determined by the sequence of excursions .",
    "then , a convenient variable is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the moment when the @xmath3-th excursion is completed .    in section",
    "ii , we defined @xmath85 as the set of sites visited during the @xmath3-th excursion . the surface of the set of visited sites after @xmath3-th excursion is subset @xmath120 of visited sites that have at least one neighbor unvisited during first @xmath3 excursions or , by property ( iii ) , during the last @xmath3-th excursion .",
    "to check if the growth of the cluster of visited sites is within the kpz class of universality , consider the average width of the surface @xmath121 , defined as @xmath122 where @xmath123 numerical simulations for the cylinders with circumference @xmath124 , number of excursions @xmath125 and number of samples @xmath126 showed that    @xmath127    with scaling function @xmath128 satisfying    @xmath129    the estimated values of exponents are @xmath130 , @xmath131 in a good agreement with predictions of the kpz theory @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",

    "returning to the sequence of contours near boundary depicted on fig.[con ] , we identify contour @xmath66 of the proposition 2 with @xmath160 , graph @xmath168 with the interior of @xmath160 together with boundary sites not belonging to @xmath160 . the vertices @xmath173 and @xmath6 of the proposition 2 are identified with the boundary vertices @xmath90 and @xmath14 and the path @xmath181 with the path from @xmath14 to the contour @xmath159",
    ". then , by propositions 1 and 2 , there is a moment @xmath182 when the boundary contour @xmath183 becomes closed and a moment @xmath184 when the contour @xmath185 appears .",
    "the latter contour coincides with that in @xmath54 and therefore , by the definition of excursion , the moment @xmath186 is the end of the first excursion .",
    "three events turn out to be synchronized : the emergence of a non - contractible loop corresponding to a clockwise contour with label @xmath161 ; the completing a turn around the cylinder by the sequence of clockwise contours ; the end of the first excursion .",
    "this synchronization is preserved during the further evolution .",
    "indeed , the rotors remaining on contours @xmath187 constitute a forest attached to the boundary of cylinder .",
    "then the rotor walk continuing from @xmath188 for @xmath189 moves along this forest in the same way as the walk starting at @xmath190 moves along the original forest in @xmath54 .",
    "an essential difference is that the interiors of contours @xmath187 are not available for new labels because no clockwise contours can be closed inside them . therefore , the sequence of labels @xmath191 is disposed below the sequence @xmath192 forming a next layer which propagates in the same direction until a label appears which corresponds to the next non - contractible loop .",
    "we come to a conclusion that a natural order for disposition of labels is a helix - like sequence on the surface of cylinder .",
    "the synchronization mentioned above implies that each turn of the helix corresponds to one excursion and to one label denoting a non - contractible contour .",
    "the helical order of growth of the cluster of visited sites explains the mentioned non - uniformity of spanning trees generated by the rotor walk on the cylinder.neverthelrss , the determination of the fractal dimension of the chemical path of the obtained tree remains an open problem .",
    "a set of labels @xmath193 , @xmath194 , obtained for a particular random initial configuration @xmath54 is shown in fig.[scr ] .     the labels on the equivalent annulus with the internal ring of length @xmath195 .",
    "bold points show the positions of labels corresponding to non - contractible loops.,width=321 ]    the sequence @xmath193 demonstrates a helix structure which agrees with the construction described above and is expectedly random since @xmath54 is random .",
    "we can characterize the positions of labels by variables @xmath196 and @xmath197 , where @xmath196 is the distance of @xmath101-th label from the top of cylinder , @xmath198 is the number of chip rotations around cylinder before reaching a given site and @xmath199 is the polar angle .",
    "the helix - like structure implies that @xmath200 is asymptotically proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "the relation @xmath202 can be examined for a large number of steps @xmath101 after averaging over large number of initial rotor configurations @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath203 be a subsequence of labels corresponding to the non - contractible loops selected from sequence of all labels @xmath193,@xmath204 .",
    "four bold points in fig.[scr ] show the positions of selected labels for four first rotations of labels around the cylinder .",
    "if the helix with increasing number of turns tends in average to a regular form , the average @xmath205 should meet the relation @xmath206 where @xmath207 tends to a constant @xmath208 for every @xmath14 .",
    "coefficients @xmath207 as functions of the number of excursions @xmath209 for cylinders of radius @xmath210 . ,",
    "width=377 ]    the functions @xmath207 for different @xmath14 are shown in fig.[fig ] . for large @xmath3",
    ", we use the approximation @xmath211 to find @xmath212.when @xmath14 increases , the values @xmath212 converge rapidly to the constant @xmath213 which is estimated as @xmath214 .",
    "the obtained value of the helix step @xmath173 can be compared with the estimation of the spiral step in @xcite . in the case of planar lattice",
    ", we considered the average ratio of radius @xmath215 to angle @xmath216 @xmath217 as a function of the number of labels which is similar to @xmath207 in the present paper . in @xcite , we were not able to declare a definite value of @xmath216 @xmath217 in the limit of large numbers of the spiral rotations @xmath3 for a possible presence of logarithmic corrections @xmath218 . in the case of cylindrical geometry , the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) gives a perfect description of the large @xmath3 behavior and leads to the reliable value of @xmath173 .    despite the difference in the numerical estimations of the spiral and helical steps , the conceptual conclusions on the properties of the rotor - router walks are common in both geometries . in @xcite",
    ", we have found that the number of visits of the origin @xmath219 depends on the number of spiral turns @xmath3 as @xmath220 since one of four rotations of the initial rotor necessarily corresponds to the end of an excursion , we obtain the equivalence between the number of excursions and the number of spiral turns .",
    "the study in the present paper shows that this equivalence holds also for the helix turns .",
