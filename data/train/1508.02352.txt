    "high contrast imaging has made major strides since the first coronagraphs were used by lyot to investigate the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the success of coronagraphy using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ showed the clear advantage of the very stable environment achieved with space - based platforms , while the complementary successes of ground - based systems showed the importance of achieving very small inner working angles ( iwas ) .",
    "the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ was recognized during its early development as a powerful platform for studying exoplanets , or more generally , circumstellar environments . in consequence ,",
    "coronagraphic devices were foreseen as integral components of the science instruments .",
    "the potential is particularly large in the deep thermal regime where the mid - infrared instrument ( _ miri _ ) operates , wavelengths where very faint objects can be detected by _",
    "jwst _ in comparison with the limited sensitivity of even the largest ground - based telescopes .",
    "therefore , in addition to a classical lyot coronagraph , _ miri _ incorporates one of the most innovative concepts , the four - quadrant phase mask coronagraph ( 4qpm , * ? ? ? * ) to achieve this capability . at the time of the miri conceptual design phase ,",
    "only a few coronagraphic technologies had been validated both in the laboratory and on - sky @xcite ; the 4qpm appeared to be the best option to provide the smallest possible iwa of @xmath0 at miri wavelengths ( in this case , 10 - 16 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "direct imaging of exoplanets is one of the most challenging topics in modern astrophysics as it requires a large instrumental contrast , and hence very good optical quality . by the time of _ jwst s",
    "_ scheduled launch in late 2018 , sphere ( spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gpi ( gemini planet imager , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will have been operating for nearly five years .",
    "these near - ir ( 0.95 - 2.3@xmath2 ) , extreme adaptive optics ( xao ) facilities will have likely discovered dozens of young giant planets that _ jwst _ will be able to observe at complementary wavelengths ( 5 - 28@xmath2 ) , improving the spectral characterization of the planet atmospheres and measuring their energy balance .",
    "in addition , the large binocular telescope interferometer ( lbti ) operating in the thermal infrared @xcite will provide insights to the behavior of planetary systems at higher angular resolution than can be achieved with miri on jwst .",
    "in addition , miri coronagraphy will enable a range of investigations to measure structures in circumstellar disks , potentially identifying locations of forming planets , or the influence of unseen planets on the circumstellar material .",
    "it will also enable detailed studies of the circumnuclear environments in active galaxies , potentially probing the connection between star - formation and outflows powered by the central supermassive black holes .",
    "thus , high contrast capabilities provided by miri in the mid - infrared will open new frontiers in a variety of astrophysical contexts that have never been accessible before .",
    "this paper updates the descriptions of the miri coronagraph performance in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : modes ] introduces the coronagraphic modes available in miri and section [ sec : perf ] describes the numerical simulations and the expected raw contrast performance .",
    "section [ sec : labtest ] presents the contrast performance measured in the lab during the integration and test of the flight model .",
    "section [ sec : ta ] discusses the target acquisition procedure that is specific for the miri coronagraph .",
    "the potential interest of miri for exoplanet and disk science is illustrated in section [ sec : illustration ] together with simulated observations of known targets .",
    "finally , we indicate in section [ sec : futurecapab ] some possible expansions of the high - contrast capabilities of miri .",
    "miri has four individual coronagraphs , one of which is based on the classic design of lyot and three of which are based on four - quadrant phase masks ( 4qpms ) .",
    "the classical lyot coronagraph places an occulting spot in the focal plane to block the light from a bright point source from entering the instrument .",
    "typically , this spot is of order @xmath3 in radius so that it blocks the majority of the light from the airy core including a few bright rings . nonetheless , some extraneous light escapes 1 . ) as the diffraction pattern associated with the telescope aperture and a particular coronagraph design , and 2 . ) as phase and amplitude aberrations of the wavefront in the optical train .",
    "some of the unwanted light can be intercepted by appropriate lyot stops , at the expense of lost light , at a reimaged pupil .",
    "these stops can remove the diffracted light induced both by the telescope pupil and the coronagraphic occulting spot .",
    "however , completely suppressing the telescope diffraction pattern resulting from the multi - mirror _ jwst _ primary would require relatively complex stops .",
    "for miri , a lyot coronagraph is provided at 23 @xmath1 m , selected in part because of the lack of suitable transmissive optical materials to fabricate a 4qpm and in part to provide a broad spectral band to maximize the sensitivity on planetary debris disks ( currently available 4qpms are not achromatic ) .",
    "although classical lyot coronagraphs can provide excellent contrast outside the area blocked by the occulting spot , obviously they are limited with regard to iwa to the projected radius of this spot ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "phase mask coronagraphs are designed to reduce the iwa to near @xmath5 , by replacing the occulting spot with a transparent mask that imparts phase differences in different parts of the focal plane so when the reimaged pupil is formed the light interferes more destructively than with a lyot mask , hence rejecting the starlight outside the geometrical pupil .",
    "there are several implementations of phase - mask coronagraphs based on this principle .",
    "the theory of 4qpms is developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 4qpms in miri use an optical element that retards the phase by @xmath6 in two diagonally opposite quadrants . if a monochromatic source is placed exactly at the center of the resulting four - quadrant phase mask ,",
    "the rejection is formally complete .",
    "the overall operation is illustrated in figure [ fig : theory ] .",
    "the miri phase masks are monochromatic versions of the 4qpm , that is they are effective at a single wavelength .",
    "the miri devices generally operate with spectral bandpasses of about 10% .",
    "however , the net coronagraphic rejection suffers from several limitations including phase and amplitude aberrations , which are larger in the case of miri than the chromaticity caused by the filter bandwidth @xcite . as another defect ,",
    "a point - source lying in between two quadrants is also partly attenuated @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 4qpm reduces the sensitivity ( at maximum by a factor of 10 ) in the field along the four edges of the mask ( in a width of about 1@xmath7/d ) .",
    "all four of the coronagraphic masks are implemented in the entrance field of the miri imager on a frame supporting four sub - fields of view ; the three 4qpms provide fields of @xmath8 , while the free - standing lyot spot mask is held by supporting bars across a @xmath9 aperture .",
    "the mounting arrangement , along with that for the low resolution spectrograph slit , is shown in figure [ fig : mount ] .",
    "the location of the coronagraphic fields is shown in a flat field image ( see figure [ fig : flat ] ) ; they occupy about a third of the detector square field of view .",
    "no mechanism is required to utilize the coronagraphs - the telescope is used to position a star on each one as required .",
    "the lyot spot mask is machined in aluminium and has a radius of @xmath10 , which is 3@xmath7/d in radius at 23@xmath2 the 4qpms are etched in germanium ( figure 4 ) and then anti - reflection coated .",
    "the pupil masks , mounted in the filter wheel , are shown in figure [ fig : pupil ] .",
    "the four masks are each associated with an appropriate filter ( labeled `` c '' in table [ tab : filters ] ) together with an appropriate lyot stop in the filter wheel where the pupil image is formed .",
    "the stops have a transmission of 62% and 72% for the 4qpms and the lyot spot mask , respectively .",
    "the phase masks were designed to operate at 10.65 , 11.40 and 15.50 @xmath2 for exoplanet science while the lyot coronagraph is optimized for 23 @xmath2 , in particular for disk imaging .",
    "the two bands near 11 @xmath1 m were selected to allow detection of the nh@xmath11 feature at 10.65 @xmath1 m in exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "the choice of filter wavelengths for miri coronagraphs is discussed further in @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the central wavelengths of manufactured filters measured at nominal temperature are well controlled ( 1% offset at maximum ) , while the bandwidths can be broader by 40% at maximum .",
    "a summary of coronagraphic configurations is given in table [ tab : filters ] .",
    "the rejection is calculated on - axis and accounts for all the aberrations considered in the simulation ( see section [ sec : perf ] ) .",
    "the coronagraphs produce a radial attenuation plotted in figure [ fig : iwa ] , which quantifies the total attenuation of a point - source located on - axis .",
    "the 50% transmission radius , defined as the iwa , is about 1@xmath7/d for the 4qpms and 3.3@xmath7/d for the lyot spot mask .",
    "100% transmission ( relative ) is achieved at 3 and 5@xmath7/d for respectively the 4qpm and the lyot spot .",
    "4qpm coronagraphs were tested in the laboratory by @xcite and demonstrated on the telescope @xcite .",
    "the laboratory results showed very high performance ( raw contrast approaching 10@xmath12 ) , although use on ground - based telescopes was challenging because of the level of aberrations left uncorrected by adaptive optics as well as the need to maintain the star precisely on the center of the phase mask , a near - corollary of the small iwa .",
    "this issue will be mitigated by operation in space with jwst .",
    "therefore , the focus has shifted to tests of prototypes of the 4qpm coronagraphs for miri as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first of these papers concentrates on the specifications and manufacture of the 4qpm itself , optimized for the mid - infrared as required for miri .",
    "it considers the requirements on the chromaticity of the mask material , how well its dimensions must be matched to the wavelength of operation , and the fidelity that must be achieved at the intersection of the four quadrants ( where the star image must be placed ) .",
    "it shows the results of a variety of manufacturing possibilities and demonstrates good results using germanium as the mask material .",
    "the steps between quadrants on this successful mask were reactive ion etched .",
    "the second paper is concerned with the operation of 4qpms specifically in miri .",
    "it describes measurements of the performance of pre - flight phase masks in the miri imager test system at cea - sacley , including practical effects such as a mis - alignment of the instrument pupil with the telescope exit pupil .",
    "these experiments led to further optimization of the coronagraph .",
    "the performance with the flight units ( next section ) was predicted accurately in this work .",
    "the performance of the flight coronagraphs was verified in the flight model imager prior to its delivery to be integrated with the full miri optics module ( om ) @xcite .",
    "the test arrangement of a warm source outside the cryostat with heavy filtering to block room - temperature thermal radiation is described in paper iii . a 30 @xmath1 m diameter pinhole source ( much smaller than the fwhm of the diffraction pattern ) in the external apparatus",
    "was scanned in a raster pattern to measure the response of the coronagraphs , with results shown in figure [ fig : fmimage ] .",
    "the faint extended residual in the image to the right is due to local heating of the surroundings of the pinhole infrared source , which is not rejected by the coronagraph and places an artificial floor on its contrast performance .",
    "the coronagraph shows good rejection of the central point spread function ( psf ) , by a factor larger than 100 on - axis ( up to a few hundreds ) , although the level of rejection is probably limited more by the experimental limitations than by the coronagraph .",
    "the scans also showed that the iwa , defined as the angle with 50% of the maximum transmission , is at 1.3 @xmath7/d for the 4qpm units .",
    "figure [ fig : fmcontrast ] shows the measured contrast as a function of distance from the center of the psf , and demonstrates that it agrees closely with theoretical expectations .",
    "with the performance of the coronagraph itself confirmed , we now turn to simulations of its operation in jwst .",
    "two models are under evaluation : case a makes relatively optimistic assumptions about the wave front error , while case b is more conservative .",
    "the simulation of miri coronagraphy under case a is performed in two steps , first the calculation of coronagraphic images and psfs themselves and then a photometric treatment that includes sources of noise .",
    "the images are modeled with a fourier - based approach described in @xcite .",
    "the model accounts for the telescope pupil ( 18 hexagonal segments separated by small gaps ) and phase aberrations ( independent on each segment ) , for a total of @xmath13130 nm root mean square ( rms ) ( mid and high frequencies ) wavefront error ( wfe ) , as well as a global low order aberration in the form of defocus equivalent to 2 mm at the telescope focal plane . in the pupil plane ( filter wheel )",
    ", the position of the lyot stop can be mis - aligned so it is offset by 3% of the size of the pupil and includes also a 0.5@xmath14 rotation with respect to the perfect pupil orientation . to model the telescope pointing variations the calculation of the coronagraphic image",
    "is repeated 200 times with a 1-sigma dispersion of 7mas ( corresponding to the current specifications for jwst ) and all realizations are summed in the end .",
    "a reference star image is calculated simultaneously ( same setup as the target ) but considering different jitter realizations .",
    "we assume that the target / reference duty cycle can be short enough to neglect the variation of the wavefront errors and consider that the target to reference mismatch is driven by the pointing precision of 5mas ( the _ jwst _ pointing requirement at 1-sigma / axis ) .",
    "finally , several off - axis images ( psfs ) are generated in the field at various positions ( @xmath15 ) to account for the coronagraphic radial attenuation ( see figure [ fig : iwa ] ) .",
    "both types of coronagraphs are included in the simulation , the 4qpm and the lyot spot mask .",
    "for the broad band filter f2300c , polychromatic images are generated according to the tabulated transmission of this filter ; the 4qpm coronagraphs were simulated with their integral filters .",
    "raw coronagraphic contrasts ( azimuthally averaged ) , corresponding to the first step of the simulation ( free of detection noise ) , are shown in figure [ fig : rawcontrast ] , together with 5-@xmath16 post - processing contrasts after reference star subtraction .",
    "this last step provides an estimate of the maximum contrast achievable directly with this technique .",
    "however , in addition to this simple , single reference star subtraction , several more advanced post - processing techniques have been developed @xcite and should be implemented to improve this limit of detection .",
    "we now consider case b , which assumes a wfe of 204 nm and the specification offsetting accuracy ( dispersion of 7 mas 1-@xmath16 per axis with different realization for the star and the reference ) .",
    "jitter is not included .",
    "model results are shown in figure [ fig : rawcontrast ] . while the achieved contrast is a fairly strong function of optimal positioning within the coronagraph",
    ", it is even more sensitive to the relative locations of the science target and the reference star ( see , e.g , fig . 1 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the comparison with the case a simulation reflects our current uncertainty about the exact parameters that are applicable and how their effects change with wavelength ( e.g.",
    ", the current work indicates a greater difference between cases a and b at 15.5 @xmath1 m than at 11.4 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "work is continuing to understand these differences and to use the knowledge gained to optimize coronagraphic observations .",
    "the second part of the simulation includes the detection noise .",
    "we illustrate the procedure for case a. the photon noise in the coronagraphic image depends on the star distance and spectral type , telescope area ( 25@xmath17 ) , telescope and optics transmission ( 85% ) , the detector spectral response ( i.e. , quantum efficiency maximum of @xmath1380% at @xmath1315@xmath2 ) , the lyot stop transmission ( 62% for 4qpm , 72% for lyot spot and 100% for lyot bar ) , and the integration time .",
    "the net transmission in the coronagraphic filters is about 15 - 20% .",
    "the intensity of the most distant off - axis psf at 10@xmath18 serves as a normalization factor for all simulated images , as if it were an observation of the unocculted star .",
    "in addition , we assume that the reference star is identical to the target star in terms of magnitude and spectrum .    at the level of the detector ,",
    "we included read out noise ( 20e- rms ) , and flat field stability ( 0.1% ) .",
    "the thermal background accounts for several components : the zodiacal light dominates at @xmath19 , while at longer wavelengths the telescope ( primary and secondary mirrors ) as well as the deployable tower assembly shield and sunshield are mostly responsible for the thermal emission .",
    "overall the model corresponds well to the specifications of 3.9mjy / sr at 10@xmath2 and 200mjy / sr at @xmath20 ( the possible higher emission from the sunshield than originally expected will compromise the performance of the lyot system , but has less effect on the shorter wavelength coronagraphs ) .",
    "figure [ fig : perf ] displays four cases for various filters . each sub - panel shows the averaged contrast for the psf ( blue line ) and the coronagraphic image ( red solid line ) as well as the 3-@xmath16 contrast for the reference star subtraction process ( red dashed line ) and the ideal noise level if only photon noise dominates ( red dash - dotted line ) .",
    "typical contrasts after post - processing achieve @xmath21 to @xmath22 for separations larger than @xmath23 . note that the radial transmissions of the miri coronagraphs are not accounted for in these contrast profiles .",
    "the performance presented in this section is strongly related to the end - to - end optical system assumptions , such as the wavefront error and the whole optical train stability of the telescope .",
    "the simulated performance may be conservative , particularly with the development of operations and analysis techniques optimized for jwst . in any case",
    ", the current model will have to be updated once the telescope is on orbit and commissioned .",
    "miri operations , including coronagraphy , are discussed in gordon et al .",
    "( 2014 : paper x ) . here",
    "we briefly discuss the operations unique for coronagraphy , particularly target acquisition ( ta ) .",
    "to achieve maximum contrast , all coronagraph observations will require ta to center the target accurately on the coronagraph .",
    "the 4qpms are particularly sensitive to slight offsets from the optimum location ( figure 1 : * ? ? ?",
    "the lyot coronagraph is less sensitive to small offsets , but still requires precise , and repeatable tas .",
    "the basic approach to coronagraphic ta starts by selecting a suitable filter .",
    "for faint objects , the filter can simply be that associated with the coronagraphic mask , but for very bright objects , a neutral density filter will be needed .",
    "the target is initially placed at a fiducial location within the coronagraphic field of view .",
    "an exposure is obtained , a centroid is found for the target , and the offset necessary to move the target to the optimal location at the center of the coronagraph is calculated .",
    "the observatory then makes a small angle maneuver to place the target at the proper location in the coronagraph .",
    "once the maneuver is complete the observatory enters `` fine lock , '' which maintains precise pointing control throughout the observation .",
    "if the neutral density filter was used for ta , then the correct mask filter is selected for observations ( the ordering of this step is under study , in case it is advantageous to move to the mask filter before maneuvering to the coronagraph position ) .",
    "a ta must be executed for observations obtained with each coronagraph separately .",
    "thus , a science program that requires observations using multiple coronagraphs will need to take these additional tas into account .",
    "two effects make the ta process complex : 1 . ) for the 4qpm coronagraphs , the phase mask can distort the image of a star close to its center and undermine the accuracy of the centroid determination ; and 2 . )",
    "the detector arrays have latent images ( paper vii ) that could mimic planets or other exciting astronomical phenomena if the centroiding process left them close to the target star .",
    "these effects would make adequate ta very difficult at the nominal jwst offsetting accuracy specifications .",
    "fortunately , it is projected that small angle offsets up to 20@xmath18 distance will be much more accurate than dictated by the requirements .",
    "for example , an offset of up to 20@xmath18 is expected to be accurate to 5 mas ( 1-@xmath16 per axis ) .",
    "simulations of the centering accuracy on the coronagraph using the projected performance and a fiducial distance of 2@xmath18 from the coronagraph center indicate a scatter of @xmath137 mas ( rms ) and average centering errors of 2 - 4 mas @xcite .",
    "the details depend on the particular strategy , i.e. , whether one utilizes a single position for target acquisition , or uses more than one to acquire additional information about the pointing .",
    "none of the strategies quite reaches the desired centering performance for the 4qpm coronagraphs ( the lyot is much more relaxed in this area ) , so further optimization is in progress .      after",
    "the ta process is complete , images are acquired until the necessary on - source integration time is achieved .",
    "the details of the actual operation of the detectors , their calibration and data reduction are described in ressler et al .",
    "( 2014 , paper viii ) and gordon et al .",
    "( 2014 , paper x ) .    to maximize contrast",
    ", most coronagraphic observations will require coronagraphic observations of a `` reference star , '' whose image is then subtracted from the science target image(s ) .",
    "typically this will be a star that is of similar or greater brightness compared with the science target ; this ensures equal or greater signal to noise for the reference star in a similar or shorter amount of total integration time .",
    "the procedure for obtaining these observations is identical to that for the science target , including the ta .    as mentioned in section 4 , several techniques and algorithms for improving contrast",
    "have been developed that are more sophisticated than the classical reference star subtraction method .",
    "one is angular differential imaging ( adi ) , where the target and reference star are observed at multiple orientations of the observatory . because the diffraction patterns and detector artifacts are fixed to the telescope reference frame , they move relative to the target when the observatory is rolled . subtracting two ( or more ) rolled images",
    "removes , or at least reduces , these diffraction and detector features .",
    "_ jwst _ has limited roll capability ( @xmath24 ) , because it must keep the sunshield correctly positioned relative to the sun , but will still provide sufficient angular roll for some science cases at large enough angular separations from the star .",
    "larger roll angles can be achieved by observing the objects at different epochs during the year albeit with more significant changes in the wavefront error compared to back - to - back observations .",
    "another class of enhancement is centered on sophisticated image analysis techniques , such as loci or klip @xcite .",
    "this section presents a few science cases making use of the capabilities of the miri coronagraphs .",
    "we compare the simulated performance metrics presented in section [ sec : perf ] with the expected flux densities from giant planets orbiting solar type stars out to 10 pc .",
    "we also present simulated observations of the emblematic hr8799 planetary system discovered by @xcite , and observations of the debris disk associated with hd181327 .",
    "these examples illustrate the promise of the miri coronagraph in the context of exoplanet and disk science . in the case of exoplanets ,",

    "measure the ammonia absorption feature ( sensitive to the presence of ammonia clouds and to the atmospheric temperature ) ; and 4 . ) in combination with shorter wavelength measurements , support comprehensive modeling of the atmospheric properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of debris disks , the capability will let us : 1 . )",
    "explore the virtually unknown region between about 1 and 30 au , containing for example the ice lines ( not resolved with _ spitzer _",
    ", too low in surface brightness for hst or groundbased telescopes ) ; 2 . ) constrain the minerology of planetary debris ; and 3 . )",
    "search for structures maintained by larger bodies in planetary systems .",
    "colored symbols in figure [ fig : perf ] stand for the intensity of jovian planets orbiting g and m stars at 10 pc and for different assumed planetary temperatures .",
    "the radial transmission of the coronagraph for each modeled planet is highlighted with dotted lines .",
    "for synthetic photometry of planets , we used the bdcond2000 models of @xcite integrated over the miri filters .",
    "several test cases were considered : 300k , 400k , 500k with a radius of 1.0r@xmath25 and 500k , 1000k , 1500k with a radius of 1.4r@xmath25 .    at a separation of @xmath26 ,",
    "the contrasts expected , even for simple reference star - subtracted coronagraphy , enable detection in f1140c of 1.0r@xmath25 planets with temperature of 500k ( respectively 350k ) orbiting a g0v(respectively m0v ) star .",
    "the situation is more favorable in f1550c where a 400k temperature is reached at @xmath26 from a g0v star .",
    "for example ,",
    "the @xmath27 pic b planet @xcite has a temperature of 1600 - 1700k and a large radius ( 1.3 - 1.6r@xmath25 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence should be brighter than any planet in figure [ fig : perf ] , so almost visible in raw coronagraphic images ( providing the debris disk itself is fainter than the planet ) .",
    "post - processing should yield a very high signal to noise detection .      for the simulations of hr8799",
    ", we assumed an a0v star at 40pc , and 3 hours of on - source integration in each miri filter .",
    "the planets b , c , and d , were assigned temperatures of 900k , 1100k and 1100k with identical radii of 1.25r@xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding contrasts in each filter , according to @xcite , are listed in table [ tab : hr8799 ] .",
    "the angular separations are @xmath29 for planet b , c and d. some of the planets are close enough to the center of the 4qpm coronagraphs to be attenuated significantly .",
    "planet b is always at a separation larger than 3@xmath7/d in any filter so it is not impacted .",
    "planet c is inward of 3@xmath7/d in f1065c , f1140c and f1550c , and hence is attenuated by 10 , 15 and 30% , respectively .",
    "similarly , planet d is attenuated by 35 , 40 , 40% in the same coronagraphic filters .",
    "simulated images are displayed in figure [ fig : imageshr8799 ] .",
    "planets b and c are detected at all wavelengths , while planet d is only visible at 15.5@xmath2 .",
    "signal to noise ratios measured in the brightest pixel are given in table [ tab : hr8799snr ] .",
    "these numbers , if integrated over a psf size can be as large as 100 for planet b , for instance .",
    "the apparent elongation of planet d in the f1550c filter ( in which the star residuals are fainter than the planets and the background level ) is in fact due to the presence of planet e nearby .",
    "these images were used to measure the planet photometry and to compare with the initial planet intensity .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : spectrumhr8799 ] for planet b , where the solid line represents the model degraded to a spectral resolution of @xmath30 , red points stand for the initial photometry and blue points are the measurements obtained in each filter .",
    "there is good agreement in the four filters around @xmath31 . at f1550c",
    "the departure of the measured intensity from the true value is larger and likely the result of residual diffraction on one side and background noise on the other side .",
    "this does not mean miri will fail to obtain accurate photometry in these cases but rather that a special analysis will be required .",
    "another example of miri coronagraphic capabilities is given for the case of an extended object .",
    "figure [ fig : hd181327 ] shows simulated images of the ring - like debris disk around the star hd181327 @xcite .",
    "here , we assumed an f5v central star , located at 50pc , and observed for 1 hour in each miri filter .",
    "the disk model corresponds to a @xmath1390 au - wide belt containing 0.05 @xmath32 ( up to 1 mm ) of icy and porous , silicates and carbonaceous dust grains in collisional equilibrium .",
    "this model was found by @xcite to be the best bayesian solution to reproduce the disk spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from mid - infrared to millimeter wavelengths , assuming the radial brightness profile measured in newly - reduced _",
    "hst_/nicmos scattered - light images .",
    "scattering and absorption efficiencies as well as equilibrium temperatures were computed as a function of grain size distribution and composition using state - of - the - art radiative transfer techniques .",
    "monochromatic images were produced at the effective wavelength of each filter .",
    "they include a scattering phase function with @xmath33 as seen in the _ hst _ images ; their absolute flux is conservatively scaled to the _ hst _ one at 1.1 @xmath1 m to correct for the limited capability to predict scattering properties .",
    "the transition between scattering- and thermal emission - dominated regimes occurs around 10 @xmath1 m , which turns out to be the least favorable band for imaging due to an unfavorable compromise between contrast and resolution .",
    "the corresponding star to disk total flux ratio is 154 , 48 , 3.5 , 0.16 , respectively in f1065c , f1140c , f1550c , f2300c filters .",
    "the 86au ring - like pattern is obvious in all images as well as the north / south asymmetry .",
    "the 23@xmath2 image is sensitive to the outer part of the disk while the central cavity is blocked by the lyot spot .",
    "compared to the _ hst _ images obtained in the near - ir @xcite and visible @xcite , the miri images have greatly reduced stellar residuals in the center and will allow a cleaner analysis of the dust grain properties based on mid ir colors .",
    "in addition , the ring disk is seen close to face - on and hence would be immune to the gain brought by angular differential imaging in ground - based observations . here",
    ", for simplicity we assumed that the radial transmission of 4qpms is isotropic , so we did not model the cross - like pattern of this coronagraph where the field is partially obscured . in practice , for extended objects , observations at multiple rolls ( at least two at 45@xmath14 ) will enable `` filling in '' the gaps caused by the 4qpm boundaries and by the support bar in the lyot coronagraph .",
    "miri coronagraphy is centered on four filters , which can be regarded as a minimum set for spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres considering the large spectral range available . in particular , wavelengths shorter than 10@xmath2 carry the signatures of water vapor and methane , which are expected to be abundant in giant planet atmospheres . in principle , one can use the broad band filters for imaging ( labeled `` w '' in table [ tab : filters2 ] ) in combination with the lyot mask .",
    "the absence of a lyot stop to accompany these filters significantly reduces the coronagraphic rejection . however , the bar supporting the lyot mask is sufficiently large compared to the size of the airy disk , especially at the shortest wavelengths , for some coronagraphic effect to occur using the bar as the focal plane occulter . at a minimum ,",
    "these non - standard degraded coronagraphic modes should be considered as anti - saturation devices rather than coronagraphs , but they can still can be very beneficial for observing near bright stars .",
    "there are currently no plans to implement these modes on - orbit . however , we present them here for completeness and to advocate interest in them .    to illustrate their application ,",
    "similarly to section [ sec : perf ] , we performed simulations of the lyot bar mask for three imaging filters ( f560w , f770w , f1000w ) .",
    "we assume the central source is offset by 6 \" from the center of the field so the star falls on the bar rather than the lyot spot . after reference star subtraction ,",
    "the contrast performance is comparable to that of the coronagraphic modes ( figure [ fig : perf2 ] ) as the psf falls off more rapidly with radius at wavelengths shorter than those passed by the coronagraphic filters .",
    "however , we note for f560w and f770w that the coronagraphic effect is really small beyond the iwa , as expected .",
    "another possibility is to obtain multiple observations of the reference star with slightly different positional offsets .",
    "_ jwst _ has a fine steering mirror ( fsm ) , which is used to compensate for small perturbations in pointing control .",
    "the fsm can also be used during coronagraphic imaging programs to perform micro - offsets ( sub - pixel ) , thus building up a library of reference star images @xcite for use in the more sophisticated algorithms .",
    "use of the fsm has the advantage that it does not require any additional tas , both making this mode very efficient and avoiding additional errors due to small - angle maneuvers .",
    "the image library can be used for psf subtraction with a variety of algorithms ( e.g ; loci or klip , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a preliminary evaluation ( at this stage omitting the effects of latent images and pointing jitter , both of which need to be added to future simulations ) indicates possible gains in contrast by up to an order of magnitude , when working close to the iwa @xcite .",
    "this gain comes at the expense of the increased observing time on the reference star , but could be critical to success for demanding observations .",
    "the coronagraphic capability of miri is unique as it allows high - contrast imaging at wavelengths that are usually not considered for exoplanets and other high - contrast science . with _",
    "these science applications will become attractive owing to the large aperture and high sensitivity .",
    "the miri spatial resolution is comparable to those obtained in the near - ir in space with _",
    "hst_. to exploit this opportunity ,",
    "miri includes phase mask coronagraphs , which are able to offer the same iwa as the nircam coronagraphs but at longer wavelengths .",
    "even with simple , single reference star subtraction , we have shown that the expected performance of the miri coronagraphs will open a new frontier in the characterization of many astronomical objects from exoplanets , to circumstellar disks , to the near - nuclear regions of nearby active galaxies and the host galaxies of distant quasars .",
    "for example , our performance analysis indicates that the threshold of detection in terms of planet temperature is very comparable to the one achieved with sphere , about 400k . as a consequence ,",
    "the very same planets detected from the ground in the near ir with 8-m class telescopes will be potential targets for miri .",
    "miri , together with nircam , will complete the spectral characterization and determine the energy balance of young giant planets in large - radius orbits .",
    "since the coronagraphic suite of _ jwst _ was conceived ( before 2005 ) , several new developments have occurred in the field of exoplanet direct imaging , both at the instrumental level but more importantly at the data processing level .",
    "the miri performance will be enhanced by taking advantage of these new methods for data reduction that have shown significant improvement with respect to older techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented is the effort of the entire miri team and the enthusiasm within the miri partnership is a significant factor in its success .",
    "miri draws on the scientific and technical expertise many organizations , as summarized in papers i and ii .",
    "a portion of this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
