    "magnetic field is one of the most widely utilized and powerful probes of the unconventional superconducting state .",
    "it couples to momentum and spin of the quasiparticles , via the orbital and zeeman mechanisms respectively , and therefore can be used to probe both the momentum dependence of the order parameter and the spin structure of the cooper pairs .    in singlet superconductors both mechanisms are detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "the orbital coupling of the cooper pair motion to the vector potential of the field leads , in type - ii superconductors , to the appearance of a mixed state with partial field penetration .",
    "the cooper pair supercurrents and the order parameter are spatially modulated and form an array of abrikosov vortices .",
    "the upper critical field at which the second order transition into the normal state occurs is given @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the flux quantum , and @xmath8 is the superconducting coherence length  @xcite . for unconventional superconductors , below that field the number of the quasiparticles outside of the superconducting condensate , and , consequently , entropy - sensitive properties such as the specific heat or thermal conductivity , depend on the relative orientation of the field with respect to zeroes ( nodes ) or deep minima in the energy gap @xcite .",
    "the corresponding measurements have been extensively used to determine the symmetry of the superconducting state @xcite . with the heavy fermion cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 two examples where a reasonably detailed comparison of theory and experiment was carried out  @xcite .",
    "crucially , the anisotropic signal changes sign depending on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the superconducting phase diagram , so that either minima or maxima correspond to the direction of the field along the nodes  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a detailed theoretical analysis is required for the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "so far , such an analysis has only been carried out for purely orbital coupling .    at the same time measurements on cecoin@xmath0",
    "clearly show that the second suppression mechanism , depairing due to pauli spin polarization , is important in this compound @xcite .",
    "from the theory perspective , magnetic field aligns the spins of the unpaired electrons , while the singlet cooper pairs can not take advantage of the lower energy offered by a spin - polarized state . as a result , in the absence of the orbital effects , the normal state is energetically favorable above the pauli critical field @xmath11 ( for isotropic superconductors , see below ) , where @xmath12 is the superconducting gap , and @xmath13 is the bohr magneton  @xcite . the normal state is reached via a second order transition at @xmath14 and a first order transition at low temperatures @xmath15 . in the absence of strong anisotropy of the spin - orbit coupling , the number of unpaired electrons at @xmath16 does not depend on the field orientation and therefore whenever this mechanism is dominant it is not immediately obvious how efficient the field is for determination of the gap symmetry , and when exactly the inversion of the anisotropy pattern takes place .    under most circumstances the orbital suppression mechanism dominates , @xmath17 .",
    "pauli limiting is important in thin films and other quasi - two - dimensional materials , when the orbital coupling is inefficient  @xcite . in strongly layered materials even at relatively low fields the zeeman pairbreaking effect may complicate the extraction of the nodal contribution to the specific heat  @xcite . even in relatively 3d systems , if the characteristic electron velocity ( fermi velocity ) is low and hence the coherence length is short , as it is in many heavy fermion and other correlated superconductors , the orbital upper critical field is high , and can be comparable to the pauli limiting field .",
    "the question of what the vortex state anisotropies can tell us about the superconducting gap symmetry in this situation has not been explored before and is the subject of this paper .",
    "we consider a model relevant to cecoin@xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "the situation when the orbital and pauli pairbreaking mechanisms are comparable was considered early on by gruenberg and gunther  @xcite and by maki  @xcite for an @xmath18-wave superconductor with spherical fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "cecoin@xmath0 has @xmath19-wave gap symmetry with the main @xmath20-electron containing fermi surface sheet open along the @xmath21-axis  @xcite . consequently , as our first task",
    ", we compute the upper critical field as a function of temperature for different orientations .",
    "we extend previous calculations  @xcite to the fermi surface in the shape of a corrugated cylinder that gives the correct normal state resistivity anisotropy , and find the the temperature @xmath22 , below which the normal to superconducting transition becomes first - order .",
    "one of our main findings is that the commonly used criterion for determining the dominant pauli limiting regime via the maki parameter  @xcite , @xmath23 is quantitatively incorrect and depends on the symmetry of the gap and on the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "second , we analyse the anisotropy of the specific heat and the thermal conductivity under rotated magnetic field across the @xmath9-@xmath10 phase diagram including the effects of pauli limiting .",
    "since the precise details of the behavior of the anisotropy are used to infer the gap symmetry from experiment , this extension is critical for justifying @xmath5 symmetry in cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "we show that even moderately high pauli effect has little influence on the the low temperature and low field part of the phase diagram whereas its consequences near the upper critical field are considerable .",
    "we use the quasiclassical formalism  @xcite at real frequencies , @xmath24 , which allows to carry out calculations for arbitrary temperature and field and to self - consistently include effects of the field and impurities on the order parameter .",

    "we assumed non - magnetic isotropic scattering with the individual impurity potential strength @xmath40 , so that the impurity self energy does not have any momentum dependence  @xcite .",

    "before we write it explicitly , however , it is convenient to rewrite the function @xmath25 in a different representation .",

    "this is , of course , simply because the spin - split quasiparticle spectra produce a density of states at zero energy , @xmath176 , with the prefactor that , for high @xmath177 , can be large enough to dominate the sublinear volovik term already at low fields . at low temperatures @xmath174 acquires a positive curvature at high fields , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the anisotropic term , , @xmath171 , is similar for the two values of @xmath111 at low temperature , panel ( b ) , but is distinctly smaller at higher temperature , shown in panel ( d ) , and even changes sign near @xmath104 .",
    "the comparison becomes even more clear if the amplitude @xmath171 is plotted against the upper critical field for given values of zeeman splitting , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : c4vshc2 ] . at low temperature",
    "there is essentially no difference between the purely orbital case and that of a moderately strong zeeman coupling , and hence in this regime the anisotropy depends only on the shape of the gap and the underlying fermi surface .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath161 for the case of weak zeeman splitting the coefficient does not change sign , as seen already from fig .  [",
    "fig : pd](a ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath152 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd](c ) , there is a change of sign in the anisotropy of the specific heat , due to the `` isotropization '' of the upper critical field , as discussed above .     and @xmath178 in the expansion of the thermal conductivity , eq.([eq : coefk ] ) at @xmath172 ( top two panels ) and @xmath173 ( bottom panels ) for @xmath106 and @xmath152 . ]    ) is shown for @xmath172 in panels ( a ) and ( c ) , and for @xmath173 in panels ( b ) and ( d ) as function of the field , panels ( a ) and ( b ) and the reduced field , @xmath169 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) . ]    the same trend is seen in the thermal transport anisotropy . the behavior of the average thermal conductivity , @xmath179 and the twofold term responsible for the difference between heat transport parallel and perpendicular to the vortices , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa02 ] . at low fields the scattering of the quasiparticles on the vortices",
    "is determined by the vortex concentration , @xmath180 , and therefore , at low temperature , only weakly depends on the zeeman field . as the temperature increases , however , the differences between the two cases become much more pronounced .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that the two - fold symmetry @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) is much more pronounced in the pauli - limited case .    the fourfold `` nodal '' term , fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa4 ] , shows the behavior broadly similar to that of the anisotropic component of the specific heat .",
    "the low - temperature behavior as a function of the reduced field , @xmath169 is similar for the cases of weak and strong pauli limiting , while the behavior at moderate temperatures is very different starting at moderate fields .",
    "once again , the coefficients for @xmath106 and @xmath152 have the opposite signs starting at @xmath183 .",
    "notice that the shaded region at low @xmath9 and @xmath10 is identical in all three panels . ]    in conclusion , we calculated in a @xmath19-wave superconductor with quasi - cylindrical fs the @xmath104 and its evolution for transition between orbital and pauli limits .",
    "we find that in this system the critical value of the maki parameter for paramagnetic limit criterion is @xmath184 .",
    "that values depends on both the symmetry of the order parameter and the shape of the fermi surface , and hence there is no universal threshold value for that parameter that ensures the first order transition in a given system .",
    "we also find that the linear extrapolation of the upper critical field in pauli - limited superconductors from the vicinity of @xmath92 to low temperatures does not accurately predict the value of the orbital critical field .",
    "we showed that moderately large zeeman contribution does not alter the typical behavior of @xmath185 and @xmath186anisotropy at low temperatures and fields .",
    "this is summarized in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdsummary ] .",
    "the region at low @xmath9 and @xmath10 where the minima in the fourfold terms in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity occur for the field along the nodes is essentially insensitive to the strength of the zeeman coupling .",
    "the differences , of course , occur at higher temperatures and fields .",
    "this finding proves that , even in systems with strong paramagnetic contribution where @xmath104 anisotropy in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane is largely absent and therefore can not be used to infer the nodal structure  @xcite , the anisotropy of heat conductivity and heat capacity at moderate to low @xmath10 and @xmath9 still can help determine the location of the nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface .",
    "the previous analysis  @xcite of the inversion of the anisotropy in cecoin@xmath0 remains valid when the zeeman term is accounted for , and unequivocally indicates the @xmath5 shape of the order parameter .",
    "this also provides further support for the interpretation of ref .   that confirmed the inversion of the specific heat oscillations .",
