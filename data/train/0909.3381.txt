    "in recent years , we have witnessed the development of nano - devices based on molecular wires @xcite .",
    "one of their essential features is that the electric current through them can be controlled effectively .",
    "one approach to such transport control is based on conformational changes of the molecule @xcite .",
    "another scheme relies on the dipole interaction between the molecular wire and a tailored laser field @xcite .",
    "a further approach employs gate voltages acting on the wire @xcite .",
    "the latter allows a transistor - like control which has already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore as well the related control of heat transport .",
    "in general , heat transport through a molecular junction involves the combined effect of electron as well as phonon transfer processes .",
    "control of phonon transport is much more complicated since the phonon number is not conserved .",
    "nevertheless , the field of phononics , i.e.control and manipulation of phonons in nanomaterials , has emerged @xcite .",
    "this includes functional devices , such as thermal diodes @xcite , thermal transistors @xcite , thermal logic gates @xcite , and thermal memories @xcite based on the presence of a static temperature bias .",
    "the corresponding theoretical research has been accompanied by experimental efforts on nanosystems .",
    "in particular , solid - state thermal diodes have been realized with asymmetric nanotubes @xcite and with semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .    upon harvesting ideas from the field of brownian motors @xcite  originally devised for particle transport  a classical brownian _ heat engine _ has been proposed to rectify and steer heat current in nonlinear lattice structures @xcite . in the absence of any static non - equilibrium bias",
    ", a non - vanishing net heat flow can be induced by unbiased , temporally alternating bath temperatures combined with nonlinear interactions among neighboring lattice sites .",
    "this so obtained directed heat current can be readily controlled to reverse direction .",
    "if , in addition , a thermal bias across the molecule is applied , a heat current can then typically be directed even against an external thermal bias .",
    "this setup is therefore rather distinct from adiabatic and nonadiabatic electron heat pumps which involve photon assisted transmission and reflection processes in presence of irradiating photon sources @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the possibility of steering heat through a molecular junction in the presence of a gating mechanism . in doing so",
    ", the bath temperatures of adjacent leads are subjected to slow , time - periodic modulations .",
    "both the electronic and the phononic heat current are considered , as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a finite directed ratchet heat current requires breaking reflection symmetry .",
    "this can be achieved by spatial asymmetries in combination with non - equilibrium fields @xcite or in a purely dynamical way @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on an unbiased temporal temperature variation in the connecting leads .",
    "can be gated , while the vibrational frequency @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "the lead temperatures @xmath1 are subjected to time - periodic modulations.,width=302 ]    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we specify the physical assumptions and introduce our model together with the basic theoretical concepts for directing heat current across a short , gated molecular junction formed by a harmonically oscillating molecule .",
    "the heat flux is induced by temperature modulations in the contacting leads .",
    "section iii presents the results for case ( i ) where the temperature is modulated in one lead only .",
    "we elaborate on the phenomenon of pumping heat against a static thermal bias and consider the resulting thermoelectric power . in section iv , we consider case ( ii ) with both lead temperatures periodically , but asymmetrically modulated .",
    "a finite directed heat current emerges from harmonic mixing of different frequencies , which entails dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "since the leading order of this heat current is of third order only in the driving strengths , the overall rectification is weaker as compared to case ( i ) where the heat flux starts out at second order in the driving amplitude . the latter scheme with its symmetric static parameters",
    ", however , provides a more efficient control scenario : the direction of the resulting heat current can be readily reversed either by a gate voltage or by adjusting the relative phase shift within the harmonic mixing signal for the temperature modulation .",
    "section v contains a summary and an outlook .",
    "we consider a molecular junction between two leads and a static gate voltage acting on the junction .",
    "heat transport from both electrons and phonons is taken into account .",
    "since we focus on coherent transport in a short molecular wire @xcite , electron - phonon interaction can be ignored .",
    "moreover , we treat ballistic heat transfer for the electron system and the phonon system in the absence of anharmonic interactions and dissipative intra - wire scattering processes . then , the heat flux can be obtained in terms of a landauer - type expression involving corresponding temperature - independent transmission probabilities for both the electrons @xcite and the phonons @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian can thus be separated into electron and phonon part , i.e. , @xmath2 each of which consisting of a wire contribution , a lead contribution , and an interaction term , such that @xmath3    the short molecular wire is modeled as a single energy level and one harmonic phonon mode only .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the wire electron in tight - binding approximation reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the on - site energy of the tight - binding level which can be shifted via a gate voltage .",
    "the electrons in the leads are modeled as ideal electron gases , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 creates an electron in state @xmath8 of lead @xmath9 .",
    "the electron tunneling hamiltonian @xmath10 establishes the contact between the wire and the leads .",
    "this tunneling coupling is characterized by the spectral density @xmath11 .",
    "we assume symmetric coupling within a wide - band limit such that @xmath12 .",
    "the phonon mode is represented by a harmonic oscillator with the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the position and the momentum operator , respectively , @xmath16 denotes the atom mass and @xmath0 the characteristic phonon frequency of wire . the phonon bath and its bilinear coupling to the wire system",
    "is described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the position operators , momentum operators , and frequencies associated with the bath degrees of freedom ; @xmath19 are the masses and @xmath20 represent a symmetric phonon wire - lead coupling strength for lead @xmath21 .",
    "the position and momentum operators can be expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators for phonons as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    throughout the following",
    "we assume that slow , time modulated temperature system acting on the baths are always sufficiently slow so that a thermal quasi - equilibrium for the molecular wire system can assumed .",
    "the heat transport then obeys the adiabatic , exact coherent quantum transport laws as discussed in the next subsection , see eq .",

    ", we invoke a non - equilibrium situation via an adiabatically slow temperature modulation @xmath30 in the leads .",
    "the latter can be realized experimentally , for example , by use of a heating / cooling circulator @xcite .",
    "then the expectation values of the electron and phonon lead operators then read @xmath31 where @xmath32^{-1}$ ] and @xmath33^{-1}$ ] denote the fermi - dirac distribution and the bose - einstein distribution , respectively , which both inherit a time - dependence from the temperature modulation .",
    "this implies a time - scale separation which is justified by the fact that laser heating of a metallic system , the electrons undergo rather fast thermalization @xcite .",
    "the corresponding relaxation times stem from electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction , and for a typical metal is in the order of a few fs or ps , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the changes of the lead temperatures occur on a time - scale much smaller than the thermal fluctuations itself , i.e.  @xmath34ps .",
    "the time - varying lead temperatures @xmath35 and @xmath36 are assumed to be time - periodic @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the time - averaged environmental reference temperature .",
    "this implies a vanishing temperature bias @xmath39    in the long - time limit , the time - dependent , asymptotic heat current @xmath40 assumes the periodicity @xmath41 of the external driving field @xmath42 henceforth we focus on the stationary heat current @xmath43 which follows from the average over a full driving period : @xmath44    if the lead temperatures are modulated slowly enough ( adiabatic temperature rocking ) , the dynamical thermal bias @xmath45 can be viewed as a static bias at time @xmath46 in the adiabatic limit @xmath47 . thus the asymptotic electron and phonon heat currents @xmath48 can be expressed by the landauer - type formula for electron heat flux @xcite and for the phonon heat flux @xcite , such that @xmath49,\\label{j } \\\\",

    "note that the two opposite heat fluxes are not at equilibrium with each other and that the heat energy transferred by a single electron scattering process is @xmath54 rather than @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "at zero temperature , where the energy levels below fermi energy @xmath55 are fully occupied , no heat current is transferred since no electron can tunnel . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the tunneling process is thermally activated .",
    "an electron with energy @xmath52 tunneling from left lead to right lead will dissipate to the fermi energy level . therefore the heat energy transferred by this electron is @xmath54 .",
    "the electron transmission coefficient @xmath50 can be expressed by the electron green s functions @xcite @xmath56 , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 , stems from the tunnel coupling to lead @xmath21 .",
    "for the present case of a one - site wire , this operator is simply a @xmath58-matrix , so that the green s function reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 .    for a molecular wire with a single level such as described by eq .",
    "( [ h - wire ] ) , the electron transmission assumes the breit - wigner form and obeys @xcite @xmath61    where we have assumed symmetric electron wire - lead coupling such that @xmath62 .",
    "the phonon transmission coefficient @xmath51 is evaluated following ref .",
    "as is shown in appendix a , it assumes for one phonon mode as well a breit - wigner form , i.e. , the temperature - independent phonon transmission probability reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is the debye cut - off frequency of phonon reservoirs in the lead and @xmath66 incorporating the phonon wire - lead coupling @xmath67 .      in our numerical investigation",
    "we insert the electron wire - lead tunnel rate @xmath68ev , which has been used also to describe electron tunneling between a phenyldithiol ( pdt ) molecule and gold contact @xcite .",
    "the phonon frequency @xmath69 is typical for a carbon - carbon bond @xcite . for the debye cut - off frequency for phonon reservoirs we use the value for gold which is @xmath70 .",
    "the phonon coupling frequency @xmath71 is chosen such that the static thermal conductance assumes the value @xmath72 which has been measured in experiments with alkane molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "these parameters imply physical time scales which are worth being discussed . during the dephasing time ,",
    "electron - phonon interactions within the wire destroy the electron s quantum mechanical phase . if this time is larger than the dwell time , i.e. , the time an electron spends in the wire , the electron transport is predominantly coherent @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the dwell time by the tunneling traversal time @xmath73^{-1/2}$ ] which for our parameters is of the order @xmath74fs and , thus , much shorter than the typical electron - phonon relaxation time ( dephasing time ) which is of the order of 1ps .",
    "this implies that the electronic motion is predominantly coherent , so that the electron - phonon interaction within the wire can be ignored .",
    "the phonon relaxation time within wire can be estimated as @xmath75fs . among the above mentioned time scales ,",
    "the maximum time scale is the electron - phonon relaxation time which is in the order of ps .",

    "this allows one to tune the electron transport while keeping the phonons untouched . in fig .",
    "[ e1 ] , we depict the net electron heat current @xmath91 as a function of @xmath77 for a fixed driving amplitude .",
    "we find that the heat current possesses an extremum for @xmath92 , i.e. , when the onsite energy is aligned with the fermi energy .",
    "interestingly enough , this extremum is a maximum for low reference temperature @xmath78 and turns into a minimum when the temperature exceeds a certain values .",
    "this implies that the net electron heat current is rather sensitive to the on - site energy with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "this property thus provides an efficient way to determine experimentally the fermi energy of the wire as an alternative to , e.g. , measuring the thermopower as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for large gate variations",
    "we find that the directed electron heat current is significantly suppressed since the wire level is far off the electron thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath93 .",

    "a necessary ingredient is the non - linearity of the initial electron and phonon distribution , which is manifest in the fermi - dirac distribution and the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the first scenario yields sizable heat currents proportional to the squared amplitude of the temperature modulation .",
    "the resulting heat flow occurs in the absence of a static thermal bias",
    ". we also studied heat pumping against an external static thermal bias and computed the corresponding thermal heat - current load characteristics .",
    "moreover , the ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current .",
    "this ratchet heat current induces a novel phenomenon , namely a ratchet - induced , effective thermopower , see in fig .",
    "[ volsee ] .    when the asymmetry is induced by temperature rocking at both leads , the resulting net heat current becomes smaller in size .",
    "this is so because the leading - order time - averaged heat flow now starts out with the third moment of the driving amplitude .",
    "the benefit of this second scenario is the possibility of controlling efficiently both the magnitude and the sign of the net heat flow .",
    "for example , the direction of the heat current can be readily reversed via the gate voltage or the relative phase between two temperature modulations that are harmonically mixed . when adjusting the gate voltage , the directed heat current experiences multiple current reversals . the directed heat flow is even up to 7-th order in the amplitude proportional to the cosine of the phase between the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic .",
    "this allows robust control even for relatively large temperature amplitudes .",
    "these theoretical findings may also inspire experimental efforts to steer heat in a controlled manner across a molecular junction as well as the development of new concepts for measuring system parameters via their impact on the heat current .",

    "<S> we explore heat transfer in molecular junctions between two leads in the absence of a finite net thermal bias . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we consider two cases of adiabatically slow driving , namely ( i ) periodic temperature modulation of only one lead and ( ii ) temperature modulation of both leads with an ac driving that contains a second harmonic , thus generating harmonic mixing . </S>",
    "<S> both scenarios yield sizeable directed heat currents which should be detectable with present techniques . adding a static thermal bias , </S>",
    "<S> allows one to compute the heat current - thermal load characteristics which includes the ratchet effect of negative thermal bias with positive - valued heat flow against the thermal bias , up to the thermal stop - load . </S>",
    "<S> the ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current . </S>",
    "<S> an applied electric stop - voltage , yielding effective zero electric current flow , then mimics a solely heat - ratchet - induced thermopower ( `` ratchet seebeck effect '' ) , although no net thermal bias is acting . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the relative phase between the two harmonics in scenario ( ii ) enables steering the net heat current into a direction of choice . </S>"
