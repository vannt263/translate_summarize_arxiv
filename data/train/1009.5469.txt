    "recently , a renewed interest has emerged in nuclear physics research .",
    "this includes low energy fusion process  @xcite , intermediate energy phenomena  @xcite as well as cluster - decay and/or formation of super heavy nuclei  @xcite . in the last one decade ,",
    "several theoretical models have been employed in the literature to estimate the half - life times of various exotic cluster decays of radioactive nuclei .",
    "these outcome have also been compared with experimental data .",
    "most of these models applied to study exotic cluster decay can be classified into two categories : in the first category , only barrier penetration probabilities are considered .",
    "such models have been labeled as unified fission models ( ufm )  @xcite . in the second category ,",
    "clusters are assumed to be formed well before penetration .",
    "this is done by including the preformation probability in the calculations .",
    "these models have been dubbed as preformed cluster models ( pcm )  @xcite . in either of these approach",
    ", one needs complete knowledge of the potential .",
    "this problem is tackled in the literature in two different manners : one tries to adjust various parameters of model to known experimental data  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one starts from a basic fundamental approach free from such adjustable parameters  @xcite .",
    "it remain to be seen how particular set of model parameters influence the cluster decay process .",
    "we plan to address this question in this paper .",
    "we shall work out the above problem with potential obtained from the skyrme interactions .",
    "the skyrme interactions are well used to describe the fusion process at low incident energies as well as in subthreshold , collective flow , and multifragmentation at intermediate energies .",
    "the skyrme force is an effective interaction , which parameterizes the _ g - matrix _ by a zero range , density and momentum dependent ansatz .",
    "the skyrme force consists of two - body as well as three - body parts as  @xcite : @xmath3 using a short - range expansion of the two - body interaction , the matrix elements in momentum space can be written as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the relative wave vectors of the nucleons .",
    "@xmath7 is spin exchange operator and @xmath8 are pauli spin matrices . to deal with such interaction ,",
    "it is convenient to write the matrix elements in configuration space as : @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + t_{2}\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\cdot\\delta\\left(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2}\\right)\\vec{k } + i w_{0}\\left(\\vec{\\sigma}_{1}+\\vec{\\sigma}_{2}\\right)\\cdot\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\times \\delta\\left(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2}\\right)\\vec{k } ,   \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 denotes the relative momentum operators acting on the right and @xmath11 , acting on left , respectively .",
    "the three - body term of the skyrme force can be written as : @xmath12 for the hartree - fock calculations of even - even nuclei , this force is shown to be equivalent to a two - body density dependent interaction : @xmath13 the above form , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , provides a simple phenomenological representation of many body effects describing the way , in which the interaction between two nucleons is influenced by the presence of others .",
    "the skyrme interaction is an approximate representation of the effective nucleon force which is valid only for the low relative momentum . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) to ( [ eq:5 ] ) , we see several constants / parameters like @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 that need to be fitted .",
    "these parameters have been fitted by various authors from time to time to get better description of various ground state properties of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a particular set comprising these parameters is known as _",
    "skyrme force_. till to - date , large number of skyrme forces are available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these different skyrme forces constituting different equation of state at intermediate energies@xcite .",
    "all the conventional ( i.e. with the three body term replaced by a density dependent two body term ) , generalized ( adjusting the effective mass @xmath20 and compressibility @xmath21 ) and modified skyrme forces ( adjusting the density parameter @xmath17 to fit the spectra ) are unified in a single form by zhuo  @xcite as an extended skyrme force . @xmath22    our aim here is to study the role of various skyrme forces and surface corrections in the exotic cluster decay process .",
    "this study is still missing in the literature .    in recent years , there have been a number of experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite aimed at understanding the decay of light compound nucleus formed through heavy - ion reactions . in most of the reactions studied , whereas the general conclusion about the formation probability for the compound nucleus and characteristic features of its decay are debated in terms of either fusion - fission mechanism  @xcite , which may be considered as the emission of complex ( or intermediate mass ) fragments , or a deep inelastic ( di ) orbiting  @xcite mechanism behaviour .",
    "one of such system is the doubly magic @xmath0ni , which is studied by using several entrance channels ( @xmath23o + @xmath24ca , @xmath25s + @xmath26 mg ,",
    "@xmath27si + @xmath27si ) and at different incident energies ( 1.5 to 2.2 .",
    "times coulomb barrier )  @xcite . at these incident energies ,",
    "the incident flux get trapped that results in the formation of compound nucleus , which is in addition to a significant large angle scattering cross - sections . for light masses ( a@xmath2844 )",
    ", the compound nucleus decays by the emission of light particles and @xmath29-rays .",
    "an experimental measure of this so called particle evaporation residue is the compound nucleus fusion cross - section . for heavier systems , such as @xmath0ni ,",
    "a significant decay strength to heavier fragments is also observed which could apparently not arise from a direct reaction mechanism because of large mass asymmetry differences between the entrance and exit channels .",
    "the measured angular distributions and energy spectra are consistent with fission like decays of the respective compound systems .",
    "the measured mass distribution for @xmath0ni shows a preferential decays to channels comprising @xmath30-nuclei @xmath23o , @xmath31ne , @xmath26 mg and @xmath27si , and their complimentary fragments  @xcite , independent of the entrance channel nuclei and centre - of - mass energy @xmath32 .",
    "such an @xmath30-structure is associated with the shell effects in the potential energy surface of the compound nucleus  @xcite , though these are almost zero at the compound nucleus excitation energies involved .",
    "such an @xmath30-nucleus structure in the measured mass distribution of @xmath0ni has its origin in the macroscopic energy  @xcite .",
    "cluster decay is studied for @xmath0ni , when formed as an excited compound system in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since @xmath0ni has negative @xmath33 , and hence stable against both fission and cluster decay processes .",
    "however , if is is produced in heavy - ion reactions depending on the incident energy and angular momentum , the excited compound system could either fission , decay via cluster emissions or results in resonance phenomenon .",
    "the negative @xmath33 is different for various exit channels and hence would decay only if it were produced with sufficient compound nucleus excitation energy @xmath34 , to compensate for negative @xmath33 , the deformation energy of the fragments @xmath35 , their total kinetic energy ( @xmath36 ) and the total excitation energy ( @xmath37 ) , in the exit channel as : @xmath38 ( see fig .  1 , where @xmath35 is neglected because the fragments are considered to be spherical ) . here",
    "@xmath39 adds to the entrance channel kinetic energy @xmath32 of the incoming nuclei in their ground states .",
    "section [ model ] gives some details of the skyrme energy density model and preformed cluster model and its simplification to unified fission model .",
    "our calculations for the decay half - life times of @xmath0ni@xmath1 compound system and a discussion of the results are presented in section [ result ] .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
