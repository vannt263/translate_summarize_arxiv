    "type ii supernovae ( sne  ii , hereafter ) are exploding stars characterized by strong hydrogen spectral lines and their proximity to star forming regions , presumably resulting from the gravitational collapse of the cores of massive stars ( @xmath3@xmath48 @xmath5 ) .",
    "sne  ii display great variations in their spectra and lightcurves depending on the properties of their progenitors at the time of core collapse and the density of the medium in which they explode ( hamuy 2003a ) .",
    "the plateau subclass ( sne  iip ) constitutes a well - defined family which can be distinguished by 1 ) a characteristic `` plateau '' lightcurve ( barbon et al . 1979 ) , 2 ) balmer lines exhibiting broad p - cygni profiles , and 3 ) low radio emission ( weiler et al .",
    "these sne are thought to have red supergiant progenitors that do not experience significant mass loss and are able to retain most of their h - rich envelopes before explosion .",
    "although sne  iip display a wide range in luminosity , rendering their use as standard candles difficult , hamuy & pinto ( 2002 ) ( hp02 , hereafter ) recently used a sample of 17 sne  ii to show that their plateau luminosities are well correlated with the expansion velocities of their ejecta , which implies that the luminosities can be standardized from a spectroscopic measurement of the sn ejecta velocity .",
    "this `` standard candle method '' ( scm ) affords a new opportunity to derive independent and potentially precise extragalactic distances . in this paper",
    "i use a larger sample of 24 sne  iip to assess the precision of the scm and solve for the hubble constant based on two sne with cepheid distances .",
    "i collected published and unpublished photometric and spectroscopic data for the largest possible sample of sne  iip in order to re - evaluate the luminosity - velocity relation .",
    "the current sample comprises 24 sne  iip , 15 of which were included in the hp02 list . here",
    "i exclude sn  1987a and sn  2000cb from the hp02 sample for exhibiting non - plateau lightcurves .",
    "i measured apparent magnitudes 50 days after explosion ( nearly the middle of the plateau phase ) for the 24 sne  iip , i applied corrections to the observed fluxes using my best estimate for dust extinction ( see next section ) , and converted the fluxes into luminosities from redshift - based distances corrected for the peculiar motion of the galaxy and the sn host galaxy ( using the flow model described in the next section ) . also , i measured ejecta velocities from the minimum of the fe ii @xmath65169 lines , and i interpolated them to the same epoch ( 50 days after explosion ) by fitting a power - law to the observed velocities following the precepts described by hamuy 2001 .",
    "5169 versus absolute @xmath7 magnitude , both measured in the middle of the plateau ( day 50 ) of 24 sne  iip ( filled circles ) and the models of ln83 and ln85 with @xmath8 8 @xmath5 ( open circles ) . ,",
    "width=283,height=283 ]    fig .",
    "[ l_v.fig ] compares the plateau @xmath7 luminosity and ejecta velocity for these 24 sne  iip ( filled circles ) which reveals the well - known fact that sne  iip encompass a wide range ( @xmath95 mag ) in luminosities , and confirms the luminosity - velocity relation previously reported by hp02 .",
    "the extreme objects in this diagram are the dim and low - velocity sn  1999br and the luminous high - velocity sn  1992am .",
    "this result reflects the fact that while the explosion energy increases , so do the kinetic energy and internal energies .",
    "also plotted in this figure with open circles are the models of litvinova & nadezhin ( 1983 , 1985 ) ( hereafter ln83 and ln85 ) for sne with progenitors masses @xmath8 8 @xmath5 , which reveals a reasonable agreement with observations .      in order to use astronomical objects as standard candles",
    "it proves necessary to correct the observed fluxes for dust absorption .",
    "the estimate of galactic extinction is under good control thanks to the ir dust maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which permit one to estimate @xmath10 to @xmath10.06 mag .",
    "the determination of absorption in the host galaxy , on the other hand , is not so straightforward .    here",
    "i explore a method which assumes that sne  iip should all reach the same color toward the end of the plateau phase , so a measurement of the color should give directly the color excess due to dust absorption .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the opacity in sne  iip is dominated by e@xmath11 scattering , so they should all reach the same temperature of hydrogen recombination toward the end of the plateau phase ( eastman et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "next i proceed to test this method using the best - studied plateau sn  1999em as the reference for the intrinsic color . for this purpose",
    "i adopt the @xmath12=0.18 value derived by baron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from detailed theoretical modeling of the spectra of sn  1999em . for the other sne",
    "i use their @xmath13 and @xmath14 color at the end of the plateau phase to determine the color offset relative to sn  1999em and the corresponding visual extinction , @xmath12 , assuming the extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for @xmath15=3.1 .",
    "color curves of sn  1999cr ( left ) and sn  1999gi ( right ) corrected for galactic extinction , and after applying a color offset in order to match the dereddened color curves of sn  1999em ( crosses ) .",
    "the required offset for each sn is indicated in each panel in units of visual extinction @xmath16 .",
    "( bottom ) same as above but for @xmath14 .",
    "this figure shows that , while the offsets required for sn  1999gi agree quite well and probably reflect dust extinction in the host galaxy , the required offsets for sn  1999cr reveal a poor agreement.,width=283,height=283 ]    the technique is illustrated in figure [ color.fig ] .",
    "the top panels show with filled circles the @xmath13 color curves of sn  1999cr ( left ) and sn  1999gi ( right ) corrected for galactic extinction , after applying an offset in order to match the dereddened color curves of sn  1999em ( crosses ) .",
    "the required offset for each sn is indicated in units of visual extinction @xmath16 .",
    "the bottom panels show the same procedure using @xmath14 colors .",
    "hp02 found a value of @xmath0=55@xmath112 based on one calibrator ( sn  1987a ) , which proves significantly lower than the current 81@xmath110 value .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that sn  1987a is not a plateau event and should not have been included in the hp02 sample since the physics of its lightcurve is different than that of sne  iip . unlike these objects which have red supergiants progenitors ( arnett 1996 , hamuy 2003b ) , sn  1987a exploded as a compact blue supergiant ( woosley et al .",
    "1987 ) and most of the energy deposited in the envelope by the shock wave formed after core collapse went into adiabatic expansion , thus leading to a dimmer plateau and to a lightcurve promptly powered by @xmath17ni @xmath18 @xmath17co @xmath18 @xmath17fe ( blinnikov et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the cepheid distances for sn  1968l and sn  1999em will be released soon ( g. tammann and d. leonard , priv .",
    "comm . ) , thus improving significantly the @xmath0 value from the scm .",
    "sn  1999em will prove particularly important because it has far better observations than any of the other 3 calibrators , both in the @xmath7 and @xmath19 bands .",
    "\\2 ) the luminosity - velocity relation can be used to standardize the luminosities of sne  iip , and the corresponding hubble diagram has a dispersion of 0.3 mag , which implies that sne  iip can produce distances with a precision of 15% .",
    "\\4 ) the least satisfactory aspect of the scm is the dereddening method based on the sn color curves , which produces different results depending on the color used .",
    "clearly other techniques need to be explored in the future .",
    "\\4 ) this study confirms that sne  iip offer a great potential as distance indicators .",
    "these conclusions , however , are based on several historical sne with poor photometric observations and few objects in the quiet hubble flow .",
    "clearly a greater sample of sne with @xmath20@xmath43000 km  s@xmath2 and modern ccd photometry is needed .",
    "the recently launched carnegie supernova program at las campanas observatory has already targeted a dozen such sne and in the next two years it will produce an unprecedented database of spectroscopy and optical / infrared photometry for a large number of sne , which will allow us to achieve this goal .",
    "\\5 ) although the precision of the scm is only half as good as that produced by sne  ia , with the 8-m class telescopes currently in operation it should be possible to get spectroscopy of sne  iip down to @xmath7@xmath923 and start populating the hubble diagram up to @xmath21@xmath90.3 .",
    "a handful of sne  iip will allow us to check the distances to sne  ia .",
    "i dedicate this work to my dear friends and collaborators bob schommer and marina wischnjewsky , for their tireless work which led to an enormous progress of the supernova field over recent years .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through hubble fellowship grant hst - hf-01139.01-a awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
