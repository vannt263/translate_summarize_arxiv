    "a direct consequence of supersymmetry is the existence of superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "in addition , supersymmetry is strongly favored in view of grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) with tev - scale superparticles leads to precise unification of the sm gauge couplings at a single scale @xmath0  gev  @xcite . thus supersymmetric",

    "this implies that high - energy physics can be probed through the observed superparticle spectrum in low - energy regime . along this line",
    ", possible implications from physics around the gut scale have been investigated in the literature  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the matter generation structure in unified theory and show that it can be probed with superparticle mass spectrum , once observed in near future particle experiments . in gut models",
    ", quarks and leptons are generally unified into gut gauge multiplets .",
    "it is thus an interesting subject to study the recently revealed disparate flavor structure of quarks and leptons .",
    "the mssm scalar mass spectrum somehow inherits the matter flavor structure in high - energy theory .",
    "in particular , the first and second generation scalars generally have non - degenerate masses even when the universal supersymmetry breaking is assumed at a high - energy scale , as we will discuss below .",
    "we point out that particular combinations of mssm scalar masses are useful for directly extracting the matter flavor structure . with these combinations ,",
    "the origin of generation structure in unified theory is probed through scalar mass spectrum .",
    "we also discuss the implications and constraints on non - universal flavor origins in the lepton sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : gut ] the generation dependent angles are introduced to describe the flavor dependence of matter structure in unified theory .",
    "we examine the resultant non - universality of scalar mass spectrum .",
    "several scalar mass relations for extracting these angles are presented . in section",
    "[ sec : low ] , we show with these relations that the flavor structure is probed from the scalar mass spectrum , which is expected to be observed in near future particle experiments .",
    "physical implications to flavor origins are discussed in section  [ sec : lfv ] .",
    "finally we summarize the discussion in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "in grand unified models , the sm matter multiplets are unified into larger gut gauge multiplets . in the minimal @xmath1 model  @xcite , the electroweak doublet quarks @xmath2 , up - type quarks @xmath3 and charged leptons @xmath4 are unified into decuplets , and the doublet leptons @xmath5 and down - type quarks @xmath6 are combined in anti quintuplets ( @xmath7 denotes the generations ) . further in models with @xmath8 or larger unified symmetry , all matter multiplets in one generation are unified into a single gauge multiplet .",
    "the simple and naive assumption of matter unification is that three - generation matter multiplets are embedded into gut multiplets in a completely parallel fashion .",
    "while the unification of mssm gauge couplings suggests the existence of grand unification at high - energy regime , the matter unification does not seem to be simply realized and the observed quark and lepton masses and mixing indeed have diverse structures .",
    "in particular , the recently revealed lepton flavor mixing is quite different from that in the quark sector  @xcite . to realize such diversity is therefore an interesting subject in unified theory .",
    "an available approach to this subject is to adopt flavor assignment of matter multiplets in generation - dependent manner .",
    "a non - universal matter embedding naturally emerges if the unified gauge group @xmath9 is enough large to have the freedom to choose the ways of embedding .",
    "for example , in @xmath10 unified models , a vectorial representation ( @xmath11-plet ) doubly contains the electroweak doublet leptons ( and also the down - type quarks ) which can not be distinguished with respect to the sm charges . generally , each low - energy sm matter field @xmath12 could appear as a linear combination of some distinct fields . in this work",
    ", we consider the situation @xmath13 where the sm gauge charges of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are identical to @xmath12 , and these two fields are distinctive to each other with respect to @xmath16 charges . in this work , the parameter @xmath17 is referred to as the twisting angle for @xmath12 . the flavor embedding structure is thus parametrized by twisting angles @xmath18 ( @xmath7 ) in addition to the @xmath16 gauge charges of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a trivial example is @xmath19 with only three @xmath20-plets introduced as matter multiplets .",
    "that results in all twisting angles being equal . with extensions of this example , e.g.  including additional matter 10-plets of @xmath8 , the embedding of @xmath2 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is unique for each generation and then @xmath23 . on the other hand , both 16 and 10 plets contain @xmath24 multiplets of @xmath1 subgroup , and the model contains two candidates for down - type quarks and doublet leptons in low - energy regime , while these candidates have different high - energy gauge charges under @xmath25 . in this case",
    "it is therefore natural for the twisting angles to depend on the generations ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 . symmetry which is viable only for @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the continuous values of twisting angles implies that the potential terms should possess an abelian global symmetry to avoid rapid nucleon decay . ]    in the following we discuss the explicit example of @xmath30 case  @xcite with three @xmath11-plets as matter multiplets .",
    "the sm matter embedding into @xmath10 @xmath11-plets and the notation are summarized in appendix  [ sec:27 ] .",
    "our analysis is general and can be easily extended to other scenarios as long as the parametrization is valid .",
    "the only assumption we adopt in this paper is that the gauge coupling unification with the desert is respected .",
    "that is , @xmath1 or larger simple group which contains @xmath1 as a subgroup is broken down to @xmath31 at the unification scale .",
    "then the down - type quarks and doublet leptons are expressed as follows : @xmath32 where the common angles @xmath33 is a result of @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "the multiplets @xmath34 and @xmath35 are contained in a single 27-plet and characterized by @xmath36 gauge charges [ e.g.  see   in appendix  [ sec:27 ] ] .",
    "the other assignments of sm matter fields are uniquely determined @xmath37 therefore the twisting angles for these matter fields take the universal , flavor - independent values . finally we comment that non - parallel matter embedding discussed above is deeply suggested by the recent experimental results of neutrino flavor mixing in the context of grand unification  @xcite and is motivated by low - energy observations .      with the generation redundancy in unified theory discussed above ,",
    "matter fields with the same sm charges generally have flavor - dependent @xmath16 quantum numbers .",
    "the corresponding flavor - violating gauge interactions leave their imprints in scalar mass spectrum in low - energy effective theory .",
    "that is determined by non - vanishing @xmath38-term contribution  @xcite and renormalization - group ( rg ) effects  @xcite in high - energy theory .",
    "according to the generation structure , these effects induce specific types of non - universality for mssm scalar mass spectrum .",
    "a notable future is that the induced non - universality is connected to the generation twisting angles discussed in the previous section , since the flavor - dependent @xmath16 charges of matter fields are parametrized by these angles .",
    "using this fact , one can directly probe into the generation structure in high - energy theory from observed scalar mass spectrum at low - energy regime .",
    "here we study an example of @xmath10 unified theory described by and , and examine the resultant scalar spectrum with nonzero twisting angles .",
    "the following discussion is similarly carried out for more general case with  . as discussed before ,",
    "the electroweak doublet leptons and down - type quarks , that is @xmath1 anti quintuplet matter , have a redundancy of flavor - dependent @xmath39 charges .",
    "each twisting angle @xmath40 sets the @xmath41 direction in @xmath11-plet and determines its @xmath42 quantum numbers . as a result",
    ", these scalar fields receive non - degenerate masses via the @xmath38-term contribution and rg effects .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath38-term contribution .",

    "there are several patterns of the unified gauge symmetry @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "however in the present case of @xmath43 , the @xmath38-term contribution is generally parametrized by two mass parameters without assuming explicit breaking chain ( see appendix [ sec : dterm ] ) . for an eigenstate of @xmath44",
    ", it is given by the following form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the @xmath48 and @xmath49 charges of the field labeled @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the mass parameters which represent the deviation of the vacuum from supersymmetric flat directions .",
    "it is noted that the above parametrization is also valid in the case that @xmath9 is any subgroup of @xmath10 if one takes an appropriate limit of @xmath38 terms .",
    "the equation   is readily extended to the cases where matter fields are not eigenstates of the broken @xmath52 symmetries [ i.e.  @xmath53 in  ] .",
    "the @xmath38-term contributions to scalar masses of quark doublets @xmath54 , up - type quarks @xmath55 , down - type quarks @xmath56 , lepton doublets @xmath57 , and charged leptons @xmath58 are written as follows : @xmath59 where the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the mass parameters .",
    "it should be noted that when one considers the cases where @xmath8 gauge symmetry is realized at some intermediate stage of symmetry breaking chain , then @xmath63 and @xmath64 are directly connected to the @xmath38-term vacuum expectation values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "let us first focus on the particular limit @xmath65 , which is the case that @xmath10 is broken down to @xmath8 or @xmath66 without supersymmetry - breaking corrections . with the universal hypothesis for soft terms at some high - energy scale , the induced scalar masses read from @xmath67 at the gut scale . from these mass expressions ,",

    "this is because , due to the absence of @xmath8-violating parameters @xmath80 and @xmath63 , the gauge symmetry ensures the degeneracy of the first - generation scalar masses @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "also a similar observation appears in the case @xmath65 , where the @xmath79 dependence vanishes for @xmath83 .",
    "there generally appear the corrections to scalar soft masses from rg evolution above the unification scale . for the contributions from gut gauge interactions",
    ", scalar masses generally receive the gaugino corrections according to their @xmath39 charges .",

    "if future particle experiments would observe some deviations from such universality , that would provide an evidence that the unified theory has non - trivial and more complicated matter structure beyond the simplest one discussed in this paper .",
    "in this section , we perform the extraction of flavor structure in unified theory through the twisting angles using the sum rules , and among sfermion soft masses .",
    "the scalar mass corrections are induced by the gauge interactions of @xmath16 symmetry and have imprints of high - energy flavor theory .",

    "however in case that @xmath145 is sufficiently small , the @xmath149 amplitude rather depends on @xmath146 and is suppressed as @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "that does not lead to any experimental constraints . secondly",
    ", the @xmath158 process is relevant to the non - degeneracy between the second and third generations .",
    "its amplitude is enhanced for @xmath165 where the predicted branching ratio is just below the present experimental bound and would be testable in near future experiments .",
    "the @xmath158 decay is now induced through the large 2 - 3 generation mixing in @xmath136 and therefore the constraint on matter twist is insensitive to the mixing parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "finally the @xmath155 process strongly depends on the details of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "but we found that the branching fraction is predicted to be much smaller than the experimental bound and does not give any meaningful constraints on the generation twisting as long as @xmath146 is small , as observed in the neutrino experiments .",
    "the second case we discuss is that @xmath136 is the dominant origin for both large lepton mixing angles .",
    "however , it is found in this case that the scalar lepton non - degeneracy of the first two generations is severely constrained by the experimental limit from the @xmath149 rare process . as a result ,",
    "the twisting angles @xmath80 and @xmath79 should be almost aligned even if the other mixing angles in @xmath136 are sufficiently small . to see this behavior , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mueg ] the @xmath149 branching ratio as a function of the 1 - 2 lepton mixing and twisting angles . in the figure",
    "we take the explicit form of @xmath136 as @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "that is , we have assumed a conservative limit that the irrelevant lepton mixing angles are tiny ( @xmath168 ) , and then examine the @xmath145 dependence .     branching ratio .",
    "the twisting angles are set to @xmath74 and @xmath127 , and @xmath136 has the form with @xmath167 .",
    "the model parameters are similarly taken as in fig .  [",

    "the gray shaded area is excluded by the current experimental upper bound.,width=245 ]    from the figure , one easily sees that the constraint from the @xmath149 decay is rather severe for @xmath145 , even when the other mixing angles in @xmath136 are small . though the other processes , @xmath169 and @xmath155 , are sensitive to @xmath170 and @xmath146 , the amplitudes are not more than those in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfv ] .",
    "the above discussion depends on supersymmetry - breaking soft mass parameters .",
    "it is well known that the decay rates are enhanced for a large value of @xmath119  @xcite . therefore for larger @xmath119 , the constraints on the generation twisting become severer than the cases in figs .  [",

    "the results depend on the form of charged lepton yukawa matrix in the flavor basis where scalar lepton mass matrices are diagonalized .",
    "if one generally considers other forms of non - degeneracy and other flavor violation processes , the analysis can be performed in completely parallel fashion .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that the flavor structure in unified theory is probed with superparticle mass spectrum in low - energy regime .",
    "the flavor dependence is parametrized by the introduction of twisting angles which represent the embedding redundancy of sm matter multiplets into unified theory .",

    "we have obtained several sum rules for induced scalar masses : , and .",
    "these relations are independent of explicit mass scales and are the functions of twist angles only",
    ". therefore the relations are useful to directly probe the flavor sector in high - energy regime .    using the mass relations , we have studied the twist angle behaviors in the explicit @xmath10 example .",
    "it has been found that matter flavor structure in unified theory is explored if future particle experiments would reveal the superparticle mass parameters at low energy .",

    "the embedding redundancy naturally emerges if the fundamental unified gauge theory is @xmath8 or larger , and/or with the presence of extra matter .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize the sm matter assignment in unified theory , in particular , the embedding into a @xmath11-plet of @xmath10 gauge group .",
    "a main subject here is to show that the embedding of right - handed down - type quarks and electroweak doublet leptons ( and also right - handed neutrinos ) is not uniquely determined and can be generation dependent , which fact leads to non - universal quantum numbers of the broken gauge symmetry @xmath39 .    in order to examine possible matter assignments , it is useful to consider the maximal subgroup decomposition of the vector representation 27 under @xmath171 : @xmath172 the first factor @xmath173 is identified with the @xmath174 color group of the sm . furthermore , under the fixing of electroweak @xmath175 symmetry s.t .",
    "@xmath176 , each representation of @xmath177 is decomposed as @xmath178 here we have used the notation that the labels of trivial representation are dropped , and the superscript @xmath179 represents the @xmath180 index .",
    "thus the components in a @xmath11-plet transform in the following way under @xmath181 ; @xmath182 where @xmath7 denote the generation indices .",
    "it is found that the @xmath183 multiplet is the unique choice for electroweak doublet quarks in the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "each @xmath11-plet contains three sets of @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which correspond to @xmath180 triplets , and therefore the embedding of other sm matter fields is not uniquely identified .",
    "the components of @xmath180 triplets are discriminated with respect to the quantum numbers of three @xmath52 symmetries @xmath187 ^ 3\\subset e_6/su(3)_c\\times su(2)_l$ ] .",
    "we take a basis for these three @xmath52 symmetries as @xmath188 in a certain charge normalization , the @xmath180 singlets @xmath183 and @xmath189 are found to have the following quantum numbers of @xmath190 symmetry : @xmath191 with this normalization , the @xmath180 triplets @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 take the following @xmath52 charge assignment : @xmath195 ( for the proper normalization of @xmath10 generators , these three @xmath52 charges are multiplied by @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , respectively ) .",
    "it is easily found from this assignment that the @xmath180 triplets @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 belong to the multiplets of @xmath8 as @xmath199    the last factor undetermined is the hypercharge symmetry @xmath200 in the sm . in general , the generator of @xmath200 is a linear combination of the above three @xmath52 generators .",
    "the successful gauge coupling unification in the mssm implies that the sm gauge group @xmath201 is embedded into a simple group at the unification scale . under this situation ,",
    "it is a natural assumption that @xmath10 is broken down to a subgroup which contains @xmath1 symmetry at a high - energy scale , and consequently the hypercharge @xmath200 is identified with @xmath202 in the above decomposition of @xmath10 symmetry .    as a result ,",
    "the residual sm matter fields , up - type quarks @xmath3 , down - type quarks @xmath6 , doublet leptons @xmath203 and charged leptons @xmath4 , are found to be uniquely embedded into 27-plets as follows : @xmath204 ( the right - handed neutrinos are identified with a linear combination @xmath205 . )  at this stage , there appear three degrees of freedom @xmath40 ( @xmath7 ) , i.e.  the ways of embedding @xmath41 matter in the @xmath1 language , which we refer to as the twisting angles in the text .",
    "finally we comment on the @xmath206 ( baryon minus lepton number ) symmetry .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath207 is a gauge symmetry embedded in @xmath10 group , that is possible only when the matter twisting angles take the boundary values @xmath28 or @xmath29 . for @xmath28 , the generator of @xmath208 corresponds to @xmath209 and for @xmath210 @xmath211 where @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the generators of @xmath215 and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore for the general matter embedding ( @xmath216 ) , the @xmath206 symmetry is not local one .",
    "the continuous values of twisting angles implies that potential terms of the model should possess abelian global symmetries .",
    "one linear combination of these global and local @xmath52 symmetries remains intact in low - energy regime as @xmath207 ( which is accidentally enhanced within the sm matter content ) .",
    "here we present the general parametrization of @xmath38-term corrections to scalar soft masses , which arise in the rank reduction of gauge symmetry  @xcite . as an example , let us examine the case that @xmath10 is broken down to @xmath1 as the following symmetry breaking chain : @xmath218 where the breakdown occurs at two subsequent rank reduction scales @xmath219 and @xmath220 . at each scale",

    "@xmath225 is a mass parameter ( a deviation of the symmetry - broken vacuum from supersymmetric directions ) .",
    "the diagonal generators for vector representation are given by @xmath226 and @xmath227 , which commute with the @xmath1 generators .",
    "the unbroken @xmath52 generator at @xmath219 is parametrized by the angle @xmath179 as @xmath228 , and the associated gauge coupling constant is given by @xmath229 at the second reduction scale @xmath220 , there appears another @xmath38-term contribution due to the breaking of the above @xmath52 symmetry : @xmath230    d_{\\lambda_2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the end , the total @xmath38-term correction is written as follows : @xmath231d_{\\lambda_1 }    + [ g_1 ^ 2(t_2)_i\\cos\\alpha - g_1 ^ 2(t_6)_i\\sin\\alpha]d_{\\lambda_2 } , \\\\    & = & ( t_6)_id_6+(t_2)_id_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath232 are the redefined mass parameters .",
    "an important fact here is that the generators @xmath233 and @xmath234 can be rewritten by suitable linear combinations of the generators of @xmath235 .",
    "therefore if one chooses @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the basis of @xmath236 , the scalar mass correction is generically parametrized in the following form : @xmath237 the parametrization is always valid for @xmath38-term contributions associated with @xmath43 breaking , since any @xmath52 generator in @xmath39 is spanned by @xmath213 and @xmath212 .",
    "thus scalar masses generally have a wide variety due to generation - dependent charges @xmath46 and @xmath47 , according to the matter embedding discussed in appendix [ sec:27 ] .    the result is easily generalized to the case with an arbitrary gauge group @xmath9 which is a rank @xmath238 semi - simple group . above the unification scale ,",
    "@xmath9 is broken down to @xmath1 and the @xmath38-term contributions generally appear .",
    "one is always able to take a linearly independent set of @xmath52 generators @xmath239 ( @xmath240 ) as the basis of cartan generators of @xmath241 . using the generators @xmath239",
    ", the general form of scalar mass corrections is written as follows : @xmath242 the parametrization is valid for arbitrary symmetry breaking chains .",
    "if the charges @xmath243 are generation dependent according to the matter assignment in unified theory , generation - dependent contributions to scalar masses arise from the @xmath38 terms .",
