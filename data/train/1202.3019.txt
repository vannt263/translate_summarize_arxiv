    "entanglement is the essential role in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "most of the applications of entanglement information processing work only with the maximally entanglement states @xcite .",
    "they first produce the entanglement locally and distribute them into different distant locations .",
    "however , during the transmission , the particles will inevitably contact the environment .",
    "the noisy environment will degrade the entangled state and make it become a nonmaximally entangled state . generally speaking ,",
    "the nonmaximally entangled states unusually include two different types .",
    "the first type is the mixed state and the second type is the pure less - entangled state .",
    "both of which will make the fidelity of quantum teleportation degraded , quantum dense coding failed , and the quantum cryptography protocol be insecure .",
    "the method of distilling a mixed state into a maximally entangled state is called entanglement purification , which has been studied for several decades @xcite , since bennett _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an entanglement purification protocol in 1996 @xcite .",
    "another way of distilling a pure less - entangled state into a maximally entangled state is called entanglement concentration , which will be detailed later @xcite . bennett",

    "it is so called schimidt projection protocol .",
    "proposed an ecp based on entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "this protocol needs collective bell - state measurement .",
    "it was developed by shi _",
    "et al . _ , subsequently @xcite .",
    "an ecp based on the quantum statistics was discussed by paunkovi _",
    "et al._. their protocol requires less knowledge of the initial state than most ecps @xcite . in 2001 , yamamoto _ et al . _ and zhao _",
    "proposed two similar protocols based on linear optics @xcite .",
    "their protocols were both realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "the ecps based on the cross - kerr nonlinearity were proposed in 2008 @xcite .",
    "however , most of the ecps are focused on two - particle system .",
    "they are used to concentrate a two - particle entangled state @xmath0 to the bell state @xmath1 . in a three - particle system , there are two classes of tripartite - entangled states which can not be converted into each other by stochastic local operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "they are greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state and w state .",
    "the ghz state can be described as @xmath2 and the w state can be written as @xmath3 .",
    "the ecps described above for two - particle bell state are usually suitable for the case of multipartite ghz state @xcite .",
    "thus one does not need to discuss the ecp for ghz state additionally .",
    "but , this kind of ecps can not deal with the case of less - entangled w state . in 2003 ,",
    "cao and yang proposed an ecp for w class state with the help of joint unitary transformation @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "zhang _ et al .",

    "their protocol is focused on a special kind of w state , that is @xmath4 .",
    "recently , yildiz proposed an optimal distillation of three - qubit asymmetric w states @xcite of the form @xmath5    in this paper , we present two ecps for concentrating an arbitrary three - photon w state @xmath6 to a standard maximally entangled w state @xmath7 with only local operation and classical communication . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the horizontal and vertical polarization of the photon , respectively .",
    "our protocols are quite different from others for we are focused on the arbitrary three - particle w states . moreover , during concentrating , we do not require two copies of less - entangled states , but only need one pair of less - entangled satate and two single photons . in this way ,",
    "it is more practical and economical .",
    "the two protocols are implemented with different optical elements . in the former ,",
    "we use the polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) to perform the parity check and to achieve the whole task . in the later",
    ", we adopt the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement . with the help of the qnds ,",
    "this protocol becomes more powerful .",
    "it does not require the sophisticated single - photon detectors and can be repeated to get a higher success probability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the first protocol with linear optics .",
    "we denote it the pbs protocol .",
    "we show that an arbitrary less - entangled w state can be concentrated with a certain success probability . in sec .",
    "iii , we exploit the qnds to substitute the pbss and make the ecp more feasible and efficient in current technology .",
    "we denote it the qnd protocol . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a discussion and summary .",
    "in fig . 1 , we show the basic principle of our concentration protocol . in order to explain this protocol clearly",
    ", we divide the whole ecp into two steps . in a practical experiment ,",
    "both steps of the operations should be performed simultaneously .",
    "suppose a pair of less - entangled w state @xmath10 is sent to alice , bob and charlie .",
    "the photon in the spatial mode @xmath11 is sent to alice .",
    "the photon in the spatial mode @xmath12 is sent to bob , and @xmath13 belongs to charlie .",

    "is the partial entanglement source and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the single photon sources .",
    "pbss transmit the horizontal polarization component and reflect the vertical component .",
    "hwp@xmath21 and hwp@xmath22 can rotate the polarization of the state by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively.,width=340 ]    in first step , a single photon in the spatial mode @xmath25 emitted from source @xmath19 is sent to alice .",
    "it is described as @xmath26    from eq .",
    "( [ combine1 ] ) , after the two photons in spatial modes @xmath11 and @xmath25 both passing through the pbs@xmath27 , the three items @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 will lead to the two photons in spatial modes @xmath11 and @xmath25 in the same output mode . but the other three items @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 will lead to the two output modes of pbs@xmath27 both containing exactly one and only one photon",
    ". therefore , if they choose the case that the spatial modes @xmath34 and @xmath13 all contain exactly one photon , then the initial state collapses to @xmath35 with a success probability of @xmath36 the superscription `` 1 '' means the first concentration step .",
    "( [ collpase1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath37 now alice uses @xmath38-wave plate hwp@xmath22 to rotate the photon in spatial mode @xmath39 .",
    "the unitary transformation of @xmath24 rotation can be described as @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 therefore , if the photon in spatial mode @xmath42 is @xmath43 , and makes detector d@xmath27 fire , the original state is left in the state @xmath44    otherwise , if d@xmath45 fires , the original state is left in the state @xmath46    in order to get @xmath47 , one of the parties , says alice , bob or charlie should perform a local operation of phase rotation on her or his photon .",
    "it is the first step of the first ecp .",
    "the second step is analogy with the first one .",
    "it is performed by charlie , shown in fig .",

    "( [ combine4 ] ) , if charlie picks up the @xmath85 phase shift , the remaining state is essentially the four - photon maximally entangled w state .",

    "finally , if d@xmath97 fires , they will get the same state eq .",
    "( [ concentrated3 ] ) . otherwise ,",
    "if the detector d@xmath63 fires , they will obtain the same state in eq .",
    "( [ concentrated4 ] ) , with the same probability @xmath98 .    compared with the first protocol ,",
    "the function of the qnd is also the parity check .",
    "certainly , with the help of the qnd , we do not need to measure the photon directly , and the concentrated photon pairs can be remained . during the whole process , alice and charlie both",

    "interestingly , if a suitable cross - kerr nonlinearity can be provided , and the interaction time @xmath99 can be well controlled , which leads to @xmath100 . in this way , phase shift @xmath101 and 0 will not be distinguished .",
    "therefore , the discarded items in each step by alice and charlie are also the nonmaximally entangled w state and can be reconcentrated in the next round .",
    "for instance , in eq .",

    "( [ w state ] ) and ( [ concentrated1 ] ) , it is obvious to see that eqs .",

    "by far , we have fully explained our ecps both with linear optics and cross - kerr nonlinearity . in order to explain ecps clearly , for each ecp we divide it into two steps .",
    "the first step is operated by alice , and the second one is operated by charlie .",
    "bob needs only to retain or discard his photons according to the measurement results from alice and charlie by classical communication . in the pbs protocol",

    "if it is a failure , then they repeat it again until it is successful .",

    "interestingly , in the first step , suppose it is successful in the @xmath138th ( @xmath139 iteration , they always obtain eq .",

    "4 , with qnds , one can get a higher success probability . in this way , they should exploit the cross - kerr nonlinearity to generate @xmath117 phase shift on the coherent state , or use the coherent state rotation .",
    "however , the largest natural cross - kerr nonlinearities are extremely weak ( @xmath147 ) @xcite . the kerr phase shift",
    "when operating in the optical single - photon regime is about @xmath148 .",
    "with electromagnetically induced transparent materials , it is much larger and can reach @xmath149 . on the other hand ,",
    "using cross - kerr nonlinearity to implement the quantum information processing is still a controversial topic @xcite . in 2003 , hofmann _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that a @xmath117 phase shift can be reached with a single two - level atom in a one - side cavity @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , shapiro argues that the single - photon kerr nonlinearities do not help quantum computation .",
    "recently , he _",
    "_ discussed the cross - kerr nonlinearity between continuous - mode coherent state and single photons .",
    "they believed that their work constitutes significant progress in making the treatment of coherent state and single photon interactions more realistic @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also showed that it is possible to amplify a cross - kerr phase shift to an observable value , which is much larger than the intrinsic magnitude of the single - photon - level nonlinearity , with the help of weak measurement @xcite .",

    "we exploit both the linear optic element pbs and the nonlinear optics cross - kerr nonlinearity to achieve the whole task . compared with other concentration protocols",
    ", these protocols do not require the collective measurement .",
