    "the production of quarkonium states in hadronic collisions has recently attracted a lot of interest in the theoretical community , as the contributions to this workshop confirm .",
    "most of the studies done so far have concentrated on key issues such as whether the colour - octet mechanism  @xcite can indeed explain both tevatron and fixed - target data , and on trying to identify the most direct and distinct signatures of it .",
    "applications to production of quarkonium at lep and hera have also been considered . in general , i believe it is fair to say that the field is still in its infancy .",
    "the theoretical predictions require the introduction of several new nonperturbative parameters  @xcite to describe the values of colour - singlet and colour - octet operators on different states , and the available data can only in part fix these values . in absence of exactly known relations between the values of the different nonperturbative matrix elements ,",
    "connecting for example their values on 1s states to their values on 2s or p states , it is difficult to reduce the number of independent parameters .",
    "this increases the number of separate measurements needed to fix them , and reduces the set of data available to test the predictions of the theory .",
    "while the use of nonperturbative matrix elements extracted from the tevatron data  @xcite provides an acceptable description of the fixed - target data  @xcite , the naive use of the tevatron fits at hera significantly overestimates the yield of observed  in the region @xmath1  @xcite . whether this is a real problem of the current theory , or whether it is just a result of our incomplete understanding of it , is a question that still waits an answer .    with so many very basic open questions , i decided nevertheless to concentrate in this presentation on the subject of higher - order qcd corrections .",
    "given the size of the current theoretical uncertainties , i consider this subject perhaps academic .",
    "for example  @xcite , although there are arguments that the right mass parameter to be used in the perturbative evaluation of the short - distance matrix elements and in the phase space constraints should be @xmath2 ( twice the heavy - quark mass ) , it is not clear that this prescription properly reflects the correct nonperturbative result , where one expects that , at least for the determination of the phase space boundary , the quarkonium mass should be used .",
    "the two choices lead to results which differ by large factors .",
    "undertaking the task of calculating next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the lo results seems therefore a bit premature , and the hope that the inclusion of nlo effects could help making the predictions more accurate is in my view , today , not supported by solid evidence .",
    "the reason why i am interested in higher - order corrections is that hopefully they will help learning more about the structure of perturbation theory for quarkonium production in both the colour - singlet and colour - octet models .",
    "it is a well known fact that nlo corrections to charmonium decay widths are very large .",
    "it is important to remark that their size is not just a consequence of the large value of  evaluated at the charm mass scale : it is mostly the result of very large coefficients which multiply  in the radiative corrections .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens of these large coefficients when we study charmonium production at nlo .",
    "should the size of nlo corrections be very large , the whole exercise of extracting the value of nonperturbative parameters from a comparison of lo matrix elements with data , and the use of these parameters to perform predictions for different observables , would clearly have less chances of producing reasonable results .",
    "this is because nlo corrections to different observables might be in principle very different in size .",
    "i would not be surprised if this were part of the solution to the puzzle uncovered by the application of the colour - octet model to the hera data .",
    "in the present talk i will first of all briefly illustrate the technique we used to evaluate the nlo cross sections .",
    "this technique makes use of dimensional regularization , but uses universal properties of soft and collinear singularities to avoid the need of calculating the real - emission cross sections in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "this technique was first introduced for hadronic processes in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the specific context of heavy quark production in ref .",
    "the full details of the nlo quarkonium calculation , including explicit results for colour - singlet @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] states and for several colour - octet states ( @xmath6}$ ] , @xmath7}$ ] , @xmath8}$ ] ) , will be documented in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the nlo cross sections for the @xmath4}$ ] state have already appeared in the literature , in the papers of khn and mirkes  @xcite and schuler  @xcite .",
    "our results and theirs for this channel are in full agreement .",
    "next i will show some numerical results .",
    "for simplicity , i will just confine myself to the case of @xmath5}$ ] states , studied at fixed - target and at collider energies .",
    "while the results at fixed target are extremely encouraging , displaying relatively small @xmath9-factors and a significant reduction of the scale dependence , the results at collider energies are very worrisome . in short ,",
    "the radiative corrections turn out to be extremely large and negative , so as to leave us with negative total cross sections .",
    "the origin of this problem will be discussed in some detail .    to conclude",
    ", i will make a few remarks on the issue of understanding the full structure of the final states produced in conjunction with quarkonium , with particular reference to the production via fragmentation of a gluon jet .",
    "the style of this written contribution is very informal , trying to convene to the reader who did not attend the wonderful spirit of this workshop .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers , the session chairpersons and , most of all , the participants , for the great atmosphere in which the workshop took place .",
    "i look forward to more opportunities like this to openly discuss future progress in the field !",
    "we are interested here in the process @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are arbitrary hadrons and @xmath12 is a quarkonium state .",
    "we will limit ourselves to states for which the lowest - order process @xmath13 is non - zero . in this way",
    "the  contributions represent genuine nlo effects .",
    "these involve the evaluation of the virtual corrections to the @xmath14 vertex , in addition to the real emission processes @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider these processes separately .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath18 process to the total cross section gives rise to collinear and soft singularities .",
    "these can be regulated by working in dimensional regularization , giving rise to poles in @xmath19 : double poles for the leading soft singularities , and single poles for the sub - leading soft and for the collinear singularities .",
    "the soft singularities are absorbed by similar singularities present in the virtual corrections to the @xmath14 vertex , leaving finite terms which contribute to the processes with born - like kinematics @xmath20 .",
    "the collinear singularities are absorbed into a redefinition of the initial - state parton densities , according to the standard procedure of factorization of the initial - state mass singularities .",
    "the residual finite contributions correspond to purely inelastic processes @xmath15 , regulated at the boundary of phase space ( namely in the soft and collinear region ) by an appropriate `` + '' prescription .",
    "given the simplicity of the kinematics of the lo process , and given the universal character of soft and collinear emission , it can be shown  @xcite that the structure of the nlo partonic cross section is given in general quantum numbers .",
    "] by the following expression : _",
    "nlo^j,(gg)(x ) & - & _ born^j,(gg ) ( 1-x ) = _ born^j,(gg ) x + & & \\ { ( 1-x ) + f_j(x ) - p_gg(x ) .",

    "this sets to zero some universal terms proportional to @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the factorization of collinear singularities was performed in the @xmath28 scheme .",
    "all of the dependence on the quarkonium state is included in the numbers @xmath29 and in the functions @xmath30 .",

    "this is the analogous of the singularities found in the case of p - wave decays to @xmath41 . in dimensional regularization",
    ", we obtain : _",
    "nlo^j,(qq)(x ) = ( 2j+1 ) ( - ) b ( 1-x ) + f_j^(qq)(x ) , where @xmath42 is a constant factor , independent of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath19 pole can be removed by a renormalization of the @xmath7 } \\to ^3p_j^{[1]}$ ] transition matrix element , and including the @xmath44 } \\to \\;^3p_j^{[1 ] } x$ ] contribution to the cross section .",
    "any reasonable value of the renormalized coupling will however make the numerical impact of the @xmath40 channel totally negligible in all experimental configurations of interest , except for @xmath45 production at very low energy .",
    "we base this claim on a study of the @xmath40 production mechanism done using an ir cutoff in four dimensions . in this scheme ,",
    "the divergence is proportional to the logarithm of the binding energy .",
    "even with values as low as few mev the @xmath40 channel contribution to @xmath46 production is overwhelmed by the @xmath18 and @xmath37 channels .",
    "the partonic cross sections described in the previous section can be used to obtain total cross sections in hadronic collisions . for illustration",
    ", i will consider here the case of @xmath47 collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fxtchi](a ) i present the results for @xmath48 production at fixed - target energies , comparing the nlo to the lo predictions .",
    "i use the mrsa  @xcite pdf set , and show results for three different scale choices .",
    "as can be seen , the nlo calculation significantly reduces the scale dependence of the lo result .",
    "the size of the k - factor depends on the scale chosen , as well as on the beam energy .",
    "the same distributions , plotted as a function of @xmath49 in the energy domain of the tevatron collider , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fxtchi](b ) .",
    "i chose here the mrsd0  @xcite set of pdfs .",
    "the results are extremely disappointing : not only have the nlo cross sections a very strong scale dependence , but they also become negative for sufficiently large @xmath49 .",
    "what is the origin of this behaviour , which makes the perturbative evaluation of the cross sections totally unreliable ?    there are at least two problems production , as well as the leading small-@xmath50 behaviour of the @xmath51 cross sections .",
    "it is a pity that those remarks have passed almost unnoticed in the community ! ] .",
    "the first one is that the virtual corrections are very large and negative .",
    "the large universal term @xmath52 , proportional to @xmath53 , is only in part cancelled by the state - dependent coefficient @xmath54 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : b0],[eq : b2 ] ) ) .",
    "this indicates that two - loop corrections coming from the square of the 1-loop matrix elements are likely to be large is universal and directly linked to the ir behaviour of the real emission diagrams in a @xmath55}$ ] process , with @xmath56}$ ] an arbitrary colour - singlet state , we have no argument suggesting that it should be exponentiated .",
    "other @xmath57 terms arise from the virtual corrections , not all of them universal . understanding which ( if any ) of them exponentiates requires more work , which we have not done so far . ] .",
    "the second problem is that , after subtraction of the collinear singularities , the  corrections to both @xmath18 and @xmath37 processes tend to a negative constant in the @xmath58 limit : _",
    "nlo^j,(gg)(x ) & & 2c_a _ born ( - c_j ) , + _",
    "nlo^j,(qg)(x ) & & _",
    "nlo^j,(gg)(x ) , where @xmath59=43/27 and 53/36 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "there is nothing wrong in principle with these cross sections turning negative in the small-@xmath50 region , as what is subtracted is partly returned to the gluon density via the evolution equations .",
    "however in this particular case two things happen :    * the standard dglap evolution might not be adequate , as @xmath62 at collider energies .",
    "* the factorization scale ( of the order of the charmonium mass ) is very close to the scale at which the input pdf is measured or parametrized , and there is therefore no room for evolution ( resummation of large logs ) .",
    "the cross sections will therefore critically depend on the assumed shape of pdfs .    to illustrate the second point , let us assume for simplicity that we can approximate the inelastic part of the quarkonium cross section by its small-@xmath50 behaviour , in such a way that : _",
    "nlo(x ) ~ a ( 1-x ) - c , ( we left out irrelevant overall constants ) and let us assume that we can parametrize the gluon density with the following form : g(x ) = , with @xmath63 .",
    "it is then easy to show that the total cross section has the following behaviours , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath64 : _ nlo = _ born \\ {    ll a - c & + a - c & +    .",
    "if the input gluon density @xmath65 is not sufficiently steep ( if @xmath66 ) , very large logarithms @xmath67^n$ ] will appear at all orders of perturbation theory , and will need to be resummed  @xcite , or accounted for by corrections to the dglap evolution . if @xmath64 instead has a value of the order of 0.30.5 , typical of the most recent fits to hera data , no large logarithmic corrections appear .",
    "as an example of how a different choice of pdf can change things , i present in fig .",
    "[ fig : colchia](a ) the @xmath48 cross sections obtained using the pdf set mrsa , for which the input gluon density is steeper than @xmath68 .",
    "the nlo cross section remains now positive over a much larger range of @xmath49 .",
    "nevertheless the scale dependence is still so large that i would sadly conclude that no predictive power is available at nlo for total @xmath69 production cross sections at energies @xmath49 larger than few hundred gev .",
    "the situation is significantly better in the case of bottomonium states , @xmath70 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colchia](b ) . in this case",
    "the inclusion of nlo corrections significantly reduces the scale dependence of the lo result .",
    "needless to say , no conclusion on the behaviour of the charmonium cross sections at large  can be reached from the previous study , since at large  additional higher - order diagrams need to be calculated to achieve a nlo accuracy , and since the range of @xmath50 and the scales probed are significantly different than those explored in the total cross section calculation .",
    "no full nlo calculation is currently available for quarkonium production in hadronic collisions at non - zero .",
    "even the simplest case of @xmath71 production , although irrelevant phenomenologically given that no data exist , might provide an interesting theoretical insight if it were available .",
    "i would put this calculation very high on the list of things to be done !",
    "in this final section i would like to address a few additional issues related to the understanding of quarkonium production at higher orders in perturbation theory :        it is generally accepted by now that the proper treatment of the hierarchy of higher fock states is most likely the solution to a large fraction of the puzzles present in quarkonium production data .",
    "it is also clear , however , that a complete understanding of the full dynamics of the interactions involving colour - octet states ( or , more generally , higher fock states ) is still missing . to which extent this ignorance can affect our capability to perform quantitative predictions for production rates is , in my view , unclear . to give an example ,",
    "let me consider charmonium production via the colour - octet mechanism at large . in this case , we believe that production is dominated by fragmentation contributions , with a high-  gluon turning into some colour - octet state ( @xmath12 ) , that will then undergo a nonperturbative transition to a given , colour - singlet , onium state ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this final step is usually parametrized by assigning a probability , proportional to a well defined nonperturbative matrix element , and by assuming that @xmath72 will carry all of the energy of the parent @xmath12 .",
    "the nonperturbative transition @xmath73 should however be thought of as an inclusive process , @xmath74 , since one ( or more ) gluons need to be radiated . in the standard approach , these gluons are assigned zero energy . in practice",
    ", however , we know that these gluons can not carry zero energy , because they will have to materialize into some hadron , say into pions . in the rest frame of @xmath12 , it is reasonable to assume that the energy of these gluons will at least be of the order of @xmath75 , a number of the order of , say , 300  mev . in",
    "we consider as an example the transition @xmath7 } \\to ^3s_1^{[1]}$ ] , believed to be responsible for the large @xmath76 rate measured at the tevatron , there should be at least two gluons emitted . in the laboratory frame , and for production at large , the ratio of the energy carried by these gluons and the energy carried by the @xmath77}$ ] will be equal on average to the ratio of their masses , namely : = ~0.2 . as a result",
    ", the actual energy fraction @xmath78 of the colour - octet state carried by the final @xmath76 will be around 0.8 .",
    "so the fragmentation function instead of peaking at @xmath79 will peak at @xmath80 .",
    "once convoluted with the  spectrum of prompt gluons , assuming a behaviour like @xmath81 , this change will induce a change in the production rate at a given  of the order of @xmath82 . for a typical value of @xmath83 , this is a @xmath84 correction .",
    "it is important to point out that this is not a higher - twist phenomenon , in the sense that the effect is not reduced by going to larger . in order to make a more accurate prediction of the high-  production rate , it is therefore essential to improve the understanding of the colour - bleaching mechanism transition . ]",
    "notice also that this problem is not totally unrelated to the problem of connecting nonperturbative matrix elements `` measured '' in quarkonium decay via colour - octet states to the nonperturbative matrix elements needed in the evaluation of production cross sections .",
    "let me now touch on one more issue related to fragmentation .",
    "the standard approach consists in determining the perturbative boundary condition for the evolution of the fragmentation function by using the following relation  @xcite : d_0(z , m^2 ) = _",
    "m^2^ d(z , s ) , where @xmath85 is the probability that a gluon of virtuality @xmath86 decays to a @xmath76 carrying longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath78 in the infinite - momentum frame .",
    "the evolution of the fragmentation function @xmath87 is then given by the standard dglap evolution equation : d(z,^2 ) = _",
    "z^1 p_gg(z / y ) d(z,^2 ) .",
    "the problem with this equation  @xcite is that it does not respect the phase - space constraint @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "the implementation of this constraint would slow down the evolution of the fragmentation function by delaying the depletion of the large-@xmath78 fragmentation region .",
    "since the spectrum of gluons falls rapidly with @xmath90 , a proper treatment of the large-@xmath78 region can have a significant effect on the cross section .",
    "a more accurate treatment would be to use the following equation : [ nhap ] ^2 d(z,^2 ) = d(z,^2 ) + ^1_z p_gg(y ) d(z / y , y ^2 ) , together with the boundary condition @xmath91 .",
    "this evolution equation respects the phase space constraint , as can be easily checked . a consistent calculation done",
    "using nlo fragmentation functions should use this evolution , instead of the naive one .    as a final point",
    ", i would like to present a simple proposal for how to describe the exclusive structure of the final state in quarkonium production via fragmentation through a colour - octet state .",
    "after generation of a hard final - state gluon , let the gluon shower evolve , until it generates a @xmath92 pair .",
    "allow then the @xmath92 pair to evolve .",
    "if additional gluons are emitted , we can assume that no quarkonium state should be produced .",
    "this would be in fact a @xmath93 suppressed process . given that the emitted gluons are perturbative , the only way to correctly calculate the probability that the colours will recombine into a singlet state after gluon emission is by using the colour - singlet matrix elements .",
    "if no additional gluons are emitted , then consider the invariant mass of the pair .",
    "if it is below a given value ( to be parametrized by the bbl factorization scale , the scale at which nrqcd matrix elements are separated from the perturbative ones ) then we can assume that the @xmath92 pair will be converted into a colour - singlet @xmath76 plus two gluons , with a probability proportional to the nrqcd matrix element ( this matrix element depends on the factorization scale , so at the end the factorization scale dependence should cancel between the choice of the phase space boundary and the transition probability ) .",
    "this transition is equivalent to what is done in the cluster model for hadronization  @xcite , where at the end of the perturbative evolution each gluon is split into a @xmath94 pair . the energy and angular distribution of the two gluons",
    "can just be taken to be given by the 3-body phase space for transition of the @xmath92 pair into the @xmath95 final state .",
    "colour lines can be drawn between these two gluons and the rest of the shower , so that hadronization can take place ( say via the cluster model itself ) . from the point of view of the algorithm efficiency",
    ", one could use the forced evolution a la mike seymour  @xcite to always get a @xmath92 pair at the end of each shower .",
    "all of the mc inefficiency is then related to the invariant mass distribution of the pair , which will often be above the factorization scale threshold .",
    "the first attempt to produce @xmath76 states via the colour - octet mechanism in a full shower mc , using however a different approach than what suggested above , has recently been presented by ernstrm and lnnblad  @xcite .",
    "this calculation allows to make definite predictions for the structure of the gluon - jet which accompanies the @xmath76 .",
    "comparisons of these predictions with data will certainly help improving our understanding of this important aspect of the production dynamics .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that all the effects discussed in this section can lead to significant changes in the shape of the  distribution of @xmath76s observed at the tevatron .",
    "in addition to the factors described here , one should consider of course the effect of higher - order corrections due to multiple - gluon emission from the initial - state , and the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the input gluon densities and due to the chosen value of .",
    "all of these effects will also induce a smearing of the  spectrum , and could therefore influence dramatically the extraction of the nonperturbative parameters for the different channels which contribute to @xmath76 production at the tevatron .",
