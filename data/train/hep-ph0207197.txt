    "however , one also has a penguin amplitude @xmath13 involving a @xmath34 loop transition involving contributions @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the decay amplitudes are then a(^+ ^- ) = -(|t|e^i _ t e^i + |p| e^i _ p ) ,   a(^+ ^- ) = -(|t|e^i _ t e^-i + |p| e^i _ p ) , where the strong phase difference @xmath39",

    "alternatively , one may directly use @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath47 to learn @xmath1 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath47 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 may be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we estimated @xmath50 ( see also @xcite ) , obtaining @xmath51 from @xmath52 via ( broken ) flavor su(3 ) and @xmath53 from @xmath54 .",
    "plotting @xmath45 against @xmath44 for various values of @xmath1 in the likely range , one obtains curves parametrized by @xmath48 which establish a one - to - one correspondence between a pair @xmath55 and a pair @xmath56 as long as @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath58 is allowed to exceed about @xmath59 these curves can intersect with one another , giving rise to a discrete ambiguity corresponding to as much as @xmath60 uncertainty in @xmath1 when @xmath61 .",
    "in this case , when @xmath62 or @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is typically @xmath67 .",
    "one can resolve the ambiguity either by comparing the predicted @xmath47 with experiment ( see @xcite for details ) , or by comparing the allowed @xmath68 region with that determined by other observables @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in @xcite .",
    "once errors on @xmath47 are reduced to @xmath69 ( they are now about three times as large @xcite ) , a distinction between @xmath62 and @xmath70 will be possible when @xmath71 , as appears to be the case for babar @xcite .",
    "for the belle data @xcite , which suggest @xmath72 , the distinction becomes easier ; it becomes harder for @xmath73 . with 100 fb@xmath74 at each of babar and belle , it will be possible to reduce @xmath75 from its present error of 44% and @xmath76 from its present error of",
    "21% each to about 10% @xcite , which will go a long way toward this goal .",
    "in an analysis independent of @xmath49 performed since the workshop , the somewhat discrepant babar and belle values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , when averaged , favor @xmath1 between about @xmath59 and @xmath77 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we mention some results of @xcite on information provided by @xmath79 decays , which involve both a penguin @xmath80 and a tree @xmath81 amplitude .",
    "one can use the flavor - averaged branching ratio @xmath41 and the cp asymmetry in these decays , together with @xmath80 information from the @xmath52 decay rate ( assuming it is equal to the charge - conjugate rate , which must be checked ) and @xmath81 information from @xmath82 and flavor su(3 ) , to obtain constraints on @xmath8 .",
    "one considers the ratio @xmath83[\\tau_+/ \\tau_0]$ ] , where the @xmath84 lifetime ratio @xmath85 is about 1.07 .",
    "once the error on this quantity is reduced to @xmath86 from its value of @xmath87 as of february 2002 , which should be possible with 200 fb@xmath74 at each of babar and belle , one should begin to see useful constaints arising from the value of @xmath88 , especially if errors on the ratio @xmath89 can be reduced with the help of better information on @xmath90 .",
    "one can use the ratio @xmath92 to determine @xmath8 . given the values as of february 2002 , @xmath93 , @xmath94/ % jr| \\ocb(b^+ \\to k^0 \\pi^+ ) = -0.13 \\pm 0.17 $ ] , and @xmath95 ( here @xmath96 is a color - suppressed amplitude , while @xmath97 is a penguin amplitude including an electroweak contribution ) , and an estimate @xcite of the electroweak penguin contribution , one finds @xmath98 or @xmath99 at the @xmath100 level , updating an earlier bound @xcite @xmath101 .",
    "a useful determination would involve @xmath102 , achievable with 150 fb@xmath74 each at babar and belle .",
    "the `` right - sign '' ( rs ) decay @xmath103 , governed by the ckm factor @xmath104 , and the `` wrong - sign '' ( ws ) decay @xmath105 , governed by @xmath106 , can interfere through @xmath42@xmath43 mixing , leading to information on the weak phase @xmath107 .",
    "one must separate out the dependence on a strong phase @xmath48 between the rs and ws amplitudes , measuring time - dependent observables a_(t ) = ( 1+r^2 ) ( 1 - r^2 ) m t ,   b_(t ) = - 2 r ( 2 + ) m t , where @xmath108 , with @xmath109 a parameter of order 1 which needs to be known better . in ref .",
    "@xcite we use the fact that @xmath88 can be measured in the decay @xmath110 to conclude that with 250 million @xmath111 pairs one can obtain an error of less than @xmath86 on @xmath112 , which is expected to be greater than about 0.89 in the standard model .",
    "thus , such a measurement is not likely to constrain ckm parameters , but has potential for an interesting non - standard outcome .",
    "some other processes which have a near - term potential for providing information on tree - penguin interference ( and hence on @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) are the following @xcite : ( 1 ) the cp asymmetries in @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; ( 2 ) rates in @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; ( 3 ) rates in @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; and ( 4 ) rates in @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "other interesting branching ratios include those for @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , with a story for each @xcite . in order to see tree - penguin interference at the predicted level one needs to measure branching ratios at the level of @xmath126 .",
    "for other recent suggestions on measuring @xmath1 and @xmath8 , see the review of @xcite and the contributions of @xcite on the isospin triangle in @xmath127 ( @xmath1 ) , @xcite on @xmath128 ( @xmath8 ) , @xcite on @xmath129 ( @xmath10 ) , @xcite on @xmath130 ( @xmath8 ) , @xcite on @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( @xmath8 ) , and @xcite on @xmath78 and @xmath133 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these contain references to earlier work .",
    "ckm phases will be learned in many ways .",
    "while @xmath134 is well - known now and will be better - known soon , present errors on @xmath1 and @xmath8 are about @xmath135 . to reduce them to @xmath136 or less , several methods will help .",
    "( 1 ) time - dependent asymmetries in @xmath21 already contain useful information .",
    "the next step will come when both babar and belle accumulate samples of at least 100 fb@xmath74 .",
    "( 2 ) in @xmath7 an ambiguity between a strong phase @xmath48 near zero and one near @xmath63 ( if the direct asymmetry parameter @xmath137 is small ) can be resolved experimentally , for example by better measurement of the @xmath7 branching ratio and the @xmath82 spectrum .",
    "( 3 ) several @xmath9 modes , when compared , can constrain @xmath8 through penguin - tree interference .",
    "this has been recognized , for example , in @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the rates in several @xmath12 modes are sensitive to tree - penguin interference .",
    "one needs to measure branching ratios with errors less than @xmath138 to see such effects reliably .",
