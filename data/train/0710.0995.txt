    "@xcite to determine @xmath280 and @xmath313 , the dependence of those quantities on @xmath8 is much milder , partly because some factors of @xmath187 are replaced with @xmath185 in the theoretical expressions .",

    "@xcite have not estimated the sizes of uncertainties that arise from other sources , and so it is not clear whether their method of calculation leads to a more precise prediction for the cross section than the one that we have used .",

    "changes in the measured values of the cross section have reduced the discrepancy somewhat @xcite .",
    "more recently , calculations of the corrections of nlo in @xmath2 @xcite and relativistic corrections @xcite have increased the theoretical prediction for the cross section by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the shifts in the theoretical and experimental central values for the cross section have resolved the outstanding discrepancy . however , in the absence of an analysis of the theoretical uncertainties , the meaning of the apparent agreement between theory and experiment is unclear .    in this paper , we have carried out a new computation of the relativistic corrections to @xmath315 $ ] , with the goals of adding certain refinements to the calculation and making a more precise estimate of the theoretical uncertainties . some of the refinements , relative to the calculation of ref .",

    "these increase the cross section by about @xmath264 .",
    "the second , indirect source of relativistic corrections derives from the relativistic corrections to the electromagnetic decay widths of the @xmath14 and the @xmath51 , which enter into the matrix - element determinations of ref .",
    "these corrections increase the cross section by about @xmath316 ( ref .",
    "( other , smaller corrections result in a net change in @xmath317 of @xmath273 relative to the value of @xmath317 that was used in the calculation of ref .",
    "the inclusion of corrections of nlo in @xmath2 further increases the cross section by about @xmath318 , of which about @xmath319 comes from the interference between the relativistic corrections and the corrections of nlo in @xmath2 .",
    "our principal results are given in eqs .",

    "the effects of the various refinements that we have mentioned largely cancel .",

    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have not estimated other uncertainties , and so it is not clear whether their method of calculation yields a result that is more precise or less precise than ours .",
    "as we have mentioned , in our calculation , we resum a class of relativistic corrections to all orders in @xmath7 .",
    "these corrections include all of the relativistic corrections that are contained in the color - singlet @xmath48 quarkonium wave function , up to the ultraviolet cutoff of the nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the effect of the resummation beyond relative order @xmath11 is small , indicating that the velocity expansion converges well for this process .",
    "the fact that the direct relativistic corrections are modest in size supports the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effects of the finite width of the momentum - space @xmath48 wave function are not dramatic , once one excludes contributions from the large - momentum tails of the wave function that are contained in corrections of higher order in @xmath2 .",
    "let us discuss the prospects for decreasing the uncertainties in our calculation .",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the uncalculated terms of relative order @xmath321 and relative order @xmath322 .",
    "this uncertainty may be as large as @xmath323 .",
    "a complete calculation of the order-@xmath321 corrections , which are the larger ones , seems quite feasible .",
    "the calculation of the corrections of order-@xmath322 would be a major undertaking , but is not out of the question .",
    "the next largest source of uncertainty arises from the use of the nrqcd factorization formalism itself , which may lead to an uncertainty of about @xmath320 . a more thorough understanding of the issues that are involved in constructing a rigorous proof of a factorization theorem for @xmath315 $ ] may lead to a different estimate of these uncertainties .",
    "it is also conceivable that one could prove a `` higher - twist '' factorization theorem that would allow one to carry out a systematic computation of corrections to the existing nrqcd factorization formula .",
    "the uncertainties that arise from the use of the nrqcd factorization formalism presumably would decrease as the cm energy of the process @xmath166 increases .",
    "however , there are no prospects for measuring @xmath315 $ ] at higher energies in the immediate future .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath8 is the next most important source of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we estimate the resulting uncertainty in the cross section to be @xmath324 .",
    "we can expect to see some progress in reducing this uncertainty , particularly from lattice determinations of @xmath8 .",
    "our result for @xmath315 $ ] agrees , within errors , with the measurements of the belle and babar experiments .",
    "the uncertainties in our result are quite large , and , of course , it would be desirable to reduce these uncertainties , so as to sharpen this test of the nrqcd factorization approach to quarkonium production .",
    "nevertheless , it seems fair to conclude that the long - standing discrepancy between the theoretical prediction for @xmath325 $ ] and the experimental measurements has been resolved .",
