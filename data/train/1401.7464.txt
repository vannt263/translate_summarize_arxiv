    "the observation of collective flow and its description in terms of fluid dynamics is a cornerstone of contemporary understanding of the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions in terms of the creation of thermalized qcd matter . in many recent studies",
    "it has been shown that fluid dynamics utilizing event - by - event ( e - by - e ) fluctuating initial conditions ( ic )  @xcite can be successfully used to explain the large elliptic flow results for the most central collisions and also the significant triangular flow of charged particles at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite which were underestimated previously by hydrodynamic with smooth initial density distribution .",
    "e - by - e hydrodynamics with fluctuating ic also explains the hardening of charged particle spectra at larger @xmath2  @xcite , various structures observed in two particle correlations  @xcite , and it also has been used to constrain the viscosity over entropy ratio @xmath12 from simultaneous measurement of elliptic and triangular flow coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the thermal emission of photons is sensitive to the initial hot and dense stage of the expanding system  @xcite and thus photons are considered as one of the probes suitable to study ic fluctuations .",
    "it has been shown that fluctuations in the initial density distribution lead to a significant enhancement in the production of thermal photon compared to a smooth initial density distribution in ideal hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "consequently a better agreement of the experimental direct photon spectrum is obtained in the region @xmath13 2 gev/@xmath5  @xcite using thermal contribution from the fluctuating ic .",
    "the enhancement due to ic fluctuations is found to be more pronounced for peripheral collisions than for central collisions and is less pronounced at the lhc than at rhic for similar centrality bins  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the elliptic flow calculated using the e - by - e hydrodynamics is substantially larger compared to the results from a smooth initial state averaged profile in the region @xmath14",
    "gev/@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the success of fluid dynamics implies that the shape of initial spatial geometry or more precisely the initial spatial anisotropy of the overlapping zone between the two colliding nuclei leads to azimuthally anisotropic pressure gradients . as a result , an anisotropic momentum distribution of the final state particles is observed .",
    "the momentum anisotropies of the emitted particles are usually quantified by expanding the invariant particle distribution in transverse plane in terms of the fourier decomposition @xmath15 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle measured with respect to the reaction plane and various @xmath17 are called the anisotropic flow parameters .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter @xmath3 is a result of the almond shape of the initial geometry and is one of the key observables studied at the rhic experiments  @xcite .",
    "the significantly large @xmath3 measured at rhic is considered as a sign of collectivity in the produced system .",
    "the observation of significant triangular flow anisotropy @xmath0 of hadrons is attributed to the collision geometry fluctuations leading to a potential initial triangularity of the overlapping zone  @xcite .",
    "this is different from the case of @xmath3 where the global shape of the initial collision geometry already has an ellispoid shape which dominates over the local fluctuations . as a result",
    ", one finds large @xmath3 with respect to the reaction plane , whereas @xmath0 only takes a non - zero value when determined with respect to an e - by - e determined participant plane .",
    "triangular flow of photons is of particular interest as photons are emitted from every phase of the expanding system and at high @xmath2 predominantly reflect early time dynamics , hence they can be expected to particularly probe the initial conditions .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has investigated triangular flow and higher flow harmonics of thermal photons from an e - by - e viscous hydrodynamic model with kln and glauber initial conditions and argued that this leads to a very sensitive measurement of viscosity .",
    "there are three potential mechanisms by which the initial state might influence photon @xmath0 : a ) fluctuating ic lead to an overall triangular deformation of the matter distribution in the transverse plane which is mapped into a triangular flow patterm .",
    "this is the mechanism leading to hadron @xmath0 , but since the global shape of the matter distribution can only be probed by late time dynamics when photon production above 1 gev is suppressed by thermal factors , it is not evident that this mechanism also holds for e.m .",
    "b ) fluctuating ic lead to irregularly - shaped hotspots with copious photon production , and the early time evolution of such hotspots will likely lead to angular anisotropies in the photon emission .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason for this anisotropy to correlate with the hadronic @xmath0 event plane , and hence it can a priori be expected to average out in measurements unless a photon triangular event plane can be determined ( which is however impossible in any real measurement due to the very limited number of high @xmath2 photons in any given event ) c ) hotspots in the fluctuating ic leads indirectly , e.g. by development of additional radial flow , to a magnification of the photon @xmath0 . interpreting any result requires to carefully disentangle these mechanisms .    in the present work we study the @xmath2 dependent triangular flow of thermal photons from fluctuating ic in detail for 040% central collision of pb nuclei at lhc and the dependence of @xmath0 on the fluctuation size parameter and the initial formation time of the system and",
    "interpret out findings in the light of the three mechanisms outlined above .",
    "we use the e - by - e ideal hydrodynamic model framework developed in  @xcite to calculate the triangular flow anisotropy of thermal photons at lhc energy .",
    "this ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamic model with fluctuating ic has been successfully used to reproduce the @xmath2 spectra and elliptic flow of hadrons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to calculate the spectra and elliptic flow of thermal photons at the rhic and at the lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "a monte carlo glauber model is used for the initial state .",
    "the standard two - parameter woods - saxon nuclear density profile is used to randomly distribute the nucleons into the two colliding nuclei .",
    "two nucleons from different nuclei are assumed to collide when the relation @xmath18 is satisfied where , @xmath19 is the transverse distance between the colliding nucleons and @xmath20 is the inelastic nucleon nucleon cross - section .",
    "we take @xmath21 64 mb at lhc .",
    "an entropy initialized wounded nucleon ( swn ) profile is used where the initial entropy density is distributed around the collision participants ( wounded nucleons ) using a 2-dimensional gaussian distribution function @xmath22 k is an overall constant in the eq . above and",
    "the position of the @xmath23th nucleon in the transverse plane is denoted by ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the most important parameter in the above equation which decides the granularity or the size of the initial density fluctuations .",
    "it is a free parameter and we use a default value of @xmath25 0.4 fm as before  @xcite .",
    "we use an initial time @xmath26 0.14 fm/@xmath5  @xcite at lhc from the ekrt minijet saturation model  @xcite as default value but later vary the value of @xmath9 and @xmath27 from their default values to understand the effect of initial collision geometry and the hotspots on the triangular flow parameter better .    the temperature at freeze - out is taken as 160 mev which reproduces the measured @xmath2 spectra of charges pions at lhc .",
    "170 mev is considered as the transition temperature from the plasma phase to hadronic phase and we use a lattice based equation of state  @xcite for our calculation .",
    "we use complete leading order ( lo ) plasma rates from  @xcite and hadronic rates from  @xcite to calculate the triangular flow of thermal photons from the fluctuating ic .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) plasma rates from  @xcite are used to obtain the thermal photon spectra from smooth ic only .",
    "the total thermal emission is obtained by integrating the emission rates ( @xmath28 ) over the space - time history of the fireball as @xmath29 here t(x ) is the local temperature and @xmath30 = @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the four - momentum of the photons and @xmath33 is the local four - velocity of the flow field .",

    "results from smooth ic ( sic ) using complete lo plasma rates ( blue dotted line ) and nlo plasma rates ( solid orange line ) are compared . here",
    "the smooth ic is obtained by taking initial state average of 1000 random events which essentially removes all the fluctuations in the initial density distribution .",
    "we see that the addition of nlo contribution to the complete lo rate increases the thermal photon production by 1015% in the range @xmath40 gev/@xmath5 , whereas for @xmath41 gev/@xmath5 lo and nlo spectra look quite similar and fall on top of each other .",
    "in addition , we observe that the additional nlo contribution to the thermal photon production is still not sufficient to match the experimental data in the range @xmath422 gev/@xmath5 .    as shown before  @xcite , thermal photons from fluctuating ic ( fic ) along with the contribution from nlo pqcd  @xcite explain the direct photon @xmath2 spectrum measured by alice  @xcite well in the region @xmath132 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the result from the fluctuating ic is obtained by taking final state average over the @xmath2 spectra from large number of random events .",
    "the calculation of the elliptic and the triangular flow anisotropies of thermal photons from the e - by - e hydrodynamic model is numerically expensive process .",
    "the time taken by the nlo plasma rates to calculate the @xmath2 spectra is significantly larger than the time taken by the lo plasma rates and also the difference between the two rates is not significant for @xmath13 2 gev/@xmath5 .",

    "this argues that indirect effects of fluctuations , such as the buildup of a strong flow field , contribute significantly to the observed result beyond leading to an overall triangular eccentricity . for hadrons",
    "a clear mapping between the initial eccentricity and @xmath17 has been observed  @xcite , however this is not true for photons .",
    "the fluctuation size scale @xmath9 is an important parameter as both the geometry and the overal strength photon emission is strongly sensitive to its value .",
    "the initial density distribution becomes smoother for larger values of size parameter and in an earlier study  @xcite we have shown that the elliptic flow parameter for @xmath53 1.0 fm is quite similar to the elliptic flow parameter calculated using a smooth initial state averaged ic .",

    "the presence of the local fluctuations or the hotspots in the ic results in stronger radial flow velocity which allows to probe global geometry more efficiently and we see larger @xmath0 for the smaller value of @xmath9",

    "next we study the dependence of the triangular flow parameter on the initial formation time @xmath27 of the plasma .",
    "all the @xmath0 results shown till now are calculated for a very small @xmath260.14 fm which is taken from ekrt model  @xcite for most central collision of pb nuclei at lhc .",
    "now the formation time of the plasma can be larger for peripheral collisions than for central collisions  @xcite . as we do not have the formation time at lhc for 040% centrality bin from ekrt model , we choose a sufficiently large @xmath26 0.6 fm/@xmath5 to start the hydrodynamic calculation in order to see the dependence of @xmath0 on the initial formation time of the plasma .",
