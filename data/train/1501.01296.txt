    "a large number of cosmological and astrophysical observations have evidenced that 85% of the matter content of the universe is in the form of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "a generic weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is a well - motivated candidate for this new kind of matter , since its thermal production in the early universe would match the observed dm abundance .",
    "in addition , wimps can be easily accommodated in theories beyond the standard model , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "wimps can be searched for indirectly , through the particles produced when they annihilate in the dm halo ( photons , neutrinos and antiparticles ) . among the different annihilation products ,",
    "gamma - rays provide an appealing detection possibility because the signal can be traced back to the source .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has produced the most detailed maps of the gamma - ray sky for a wide range of energies , with unprecedented angular and energy resolutions . using data from the fermi - lat , various studies have revealed the presence of an excess from an extended gamma - ray source in the inner region of the galaxy  @xcite , a signal that is robust when known uncertainties are taken into account  @xcite . although the explanation of this galactic centre excess ( gce ) is still under debate ,",
    "if it were interpreted in terms of dm annihilations @xcite it would correspond to a particle with a mass in the range @xmath2  gev for a @xmath3 final state ( @xmath4  gev for a @xmath5 final state ) and with an annihilation cross section in the dm halo , @xmath6  @xmath7/s , remarkably close to that expected from a thermal relic .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain the gce in terms of simplified models for dm @xcite , considering dm annihilation into pure channels . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is crucial to investigate if this excess can be obtained within a complete theoretical framework .",
    "for example , it has been recently shown that the neutralino could reproduce the gce for dm masses up to hundreds of gev depending on the primary annihilation channel within the context of the mssm @xcite and the next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we carry out a complete analysis of the right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino in the nmssm @xcite and demonstrate that it can successfully account for the gce while fulfilling all the experimental constraints from direct and indirect dm searches as well as collider physics .",
    "we apply the lux and supercdms limits on the spin - independent elastic scattering cross section of dm off protons , which are currently the most stringent bounds from direct detection experiments .",
    "we also consider the latest results from the lhc on the higgs boson mass and couplings to the sm particles , which are known to be specially constraining for light dm scenarios through the upper bound on the invisible and non standard model higgs decays .",
    "besides , the latest bounds from the measurement of the rare decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also applied .",
    "finally , we incorporate the fermi - lat constraints on dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) and spectral feature searches in the gamma - ray spectrum , including an estimation of the effect that the most recent results derived from the pass 8 data impose on our results .",
    "this model has been extensively described in refs .",
    "it is an extended version of the nmssm , in which a new gauge singlet superfield , @xmath11 , is introduced in order to account for rh neutrino and sneutrino states as in @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of this construction is given by @xmath12 where flavour indices are omitted and the dot denotes the antisymmetric @xmath13 product . @xmath14 is the nmssm superpotential , @xmath15 is a new dimensionless coupling , @xmath16 is the neutrino yukawa coupling , and @xmath17 are the down and up type doublet higgs components , respectively . as in the nmssm , a global @xmath18 symmetry",
    "is imposed so that there are no supersymmetric mass terms in the superpotential .",
    "since we assume @xmath19-parity conservation in order to guarantee the stability of the lsp , the terms @xmath20 and @xmath21 are forbidden .",
    "furthermore , we do not consider cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "after radiative electroweak symmetry breaking the higgs fields get non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and the physical higgs states correspond to a superposition of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 fields .",
    "the rh sneutrino interacts with the sm particles through the mixing in the higgs sector thanks to the coupling @xmath25 , thereby behaving as a wimp .",
    "interestingly , light rh sneutrinos with masses in the range of @xmath26  gev are viable dm particles @xcite and constitute ideal candidates to account for the gce , as we already pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "their phenomenology is very rich , as they can annihilate into a variety of final states , some of which include scalar and pseudoscalar higgses . in particular , if @xmath27 , the annihilation final state of rh sneutrinos is dominated by a @xmath28 pair in vast regions of the parameter space .",
    "the subsequent decay of each scalar and pseudoscalar higgs into pairs of fermions or gauge bosons gives rise to non - standard final states , which often display spectral features coming from the @xmath29 final states .",
    "given that the rh sneutrino annihilation contains a mixture of final states , often including exotic configurations , the gce model - independent approach generally found in the literature is not applicable .",
    "to fit the gce we have followed the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors take into account theoretical model systematics by exploring a large range of galactic diffuse emission models final state with a mass of 49@xmath30 gev and a velocity averaged annihilation cross section of @xmath31 @xmath7/s .",
    "other analyses of the gce employ different assumptions on the galactic diffuse and point source components , and the reconstructed dm mass and annihilation cross section differ slightly . ] . regarding the dm distribution , we have considered a generalised nfw profile with slope @xmath32 in the region of interest ( roi ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as in ref .  @xcite .    to implement the aforementioned analysis , we have performed a series of scans over the parameter space of the model in the rh sneutrino mass range @xmath35  gev , computing the gamma - ray spectrum as well as the rh sneutrino relic abundance with micromegas 3.6.9  @xcite .",
    "the number of free parameters and the corresponding ranges of variation coincide with those used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( only the range in the rh sneutrino mass has been enlarged to accommodate new solutions ) . in our analysis",
    ", we have also incorporated the most recent constraints from direct detection experiments using the latest results of lux and supercdms @xcite .",
    "lhc constraints on the masses of supersymmetric particles , the mass and couplings of the sm higgs boson , as well as bounds from the rare decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , have also been implemented ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    we have set an upper bound on the rh sneutrino relic abundance , @xmath36 , consistent with the latest planck results  @xcite .",
    "besides , we have considered the possibility that rh sneutrinos only contribute to a fraction of the total relic density and set for concreteness a lower bound on the relic abundance , @xmath37 . to deal with these cases , the fractional density , @xmath38 $ ] , has been introduced to account for the reduction in the rates for direct and indirect searches ( assuming that the rh sneutrino is present in the dm halo in the same proportion as in the universe ) .",
    "then , we have convoluted the differential photon spectrum of the scan points fulfilling all these constraints with the energy resolution of the lat instrument .",
    "we have used the p7rep - source - v15 total ( front and back ) resolution of the reconstructed incoming photon energy as a function of the energy for normally incident photons .",
    "afterwards , we have calculated the @xmath0 function as follows  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the covariance matrix containing the statistical errors and the diffuse model and residual systematics  @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) stands for the measured ( predicted ) flux in the @xmath43th energy bin .",
    "the vector @xmath44 refers to all parameters of our model which determine the predicted flux .",
    "the fermi - lat satellite has also provided bounds on the dm annihilation cross section in the galactic halo derived from the study of the gamma - ray spectrum from dsphs and the search for spectral features in the galactic centre .",
    "these limits play an important role in the current analysis .",
    "let us review them in more detail .",

    "the fermi - lat collaboration has performed an analysis of the gamma - ray emission from 25 dsphs using four years of data @xcite .",
    "the absence of a signal can be interpreted as constraints on the annihilation cross section of dm particles .",
    "it is customary to assume annihilation into pure sm channels in the calculation of these bounds .",
    "the occurrence of non standard annihilation final states in our model prevents us from using these results directly .",
    "instead , we have extracted independent upper bounds on @xmath46 for each of the six more constraining dsphs ( coma berenices , draco , segue i , ursa major ii , ursa minor and willman i ) , using the dm flux predicted by our model and the mean values for the @xmath47 factors from ref .",
    "then , we have applied the most restrictive of these limits to our data .",
    "we have checked that this method leads to slightly less stringent bounds than the combined limit from the fermi - lat collaboration ( by a factor smaller than @xmath48 ) , when applied to the region of dm masses from 10 to 100 gev with pure annihilation channels .",
    "lastly , we have also estimated the impact of the preliminary results derived from the latest data ( pass  8) presented by the fermi - lat collaboration  @xcite . in general for any final state , the limit on @xmath46 improves by approximately a factor @xmath49 for a dm mass in the range @xmath50  gev .",

    "this also happens for other channels when @xmath119  gev and explains the gap in the plot .",
    "the annihilation into a pair of cp even higgs bosons takes place mostly for @xmath120  gev .",

    "moreover , the points that survive the pass  8 constraints are mainly related to dominant annihilation into non standard final states , such as @xmath77 and @xmath74 .",
    "this is due to the fact that these solutions produce four particles in the final state , which makes their spectrum different from that of the usual two - body final states .",
    "furthermore , at the same time they produce spectral features at high energies .",
    "it is worth noting that the points which are still alive and fit the gce at 95% c.l .",
    "might show up in the results of the fermi - lat collaboration in the very near future .",

    "however , this correlation can be broken in the presence of resonant annihilations . because of this as well as the different annihilation final states , the predictions for @xmath133 span many orders of magnitude  @xcite .    as already emphasised in the previous section",

    "we can observe that many of these scenarios have @xmath148 , which means that an improvement of a factor 2 in the fermi - lat sensitivity to the search for spectral features would be enough to probe these solutions .",
    "as has already been emphasised , the points in which the rh sneutrino annihilates mainly into scalar or pseudoscalar higgs bosons typically present box - shaped features and/or lines in their spectrum .",
    "the energy @xmath146 at which we evaluate @xmath145 ( and at which we expect them to be detected ) is systematically shifted towards low values , since the sensitivity of the fermi - lat instrument is better is typically achieved close to the lower - end of the box . ] .",

    "unfortunately , all of the points that satisfy our expectation of the pass 8 bound on dsphs have very small values of @xmath145 and therefore would not present any observable feature in the gamma - ray spectrum .      finally , in this section we investigate the implications of new physics searches at the lhc .",
    "in general , the nmssm introduces profound changes in the structure of the higgs sector .",
    "most notably , the addition of new states opens the door to the occurrence of light singlet - like scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons with a mass that can be considerably smaller than that of the sm higgs .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , these scenarios are very common when we try to fit the gce with rh sneutrino dm at 95% c.l .",
    "these light particles provide new decay channels for the sm higgs boson , @xmath137 .",
    "some of them contribute to the invisible branching fraction , as is the case of the rh sneutrino , the rh neutrino and the lightest neutralino ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) , whereas others would only appear as non - standard decay channels(@xmath155 and @xmath156 ) .",

    "it is therefore conceivable that some of the scenarios considered in this article can be probed in this way .",
    "we have defined the invisible branching ratio of the sm higgs and the branching ratio of the sm higgs into non sm particles as follows , @xmath161 mostly only the rh sneutrinos contribute to the invisible branching fraction , since the rh neutrino mass is generally too large .",
    "neutralinos in this scenario would decay into the rh sneutrino through @xmath162 or @xmath163 @xcite , contributing to the invisible branching ratio of the sm higgs boson . nevertheless , this contribution is negligible in most of the points of the parameter space since either the lightest neutralino is too heavy or the branching ratio of the @xmath154 process is very small .    in figure",

    "our choice of signs for @xmath170 and @xmath171 makes the coupling of @xmath132 to @xmath172 higher than the @xmath167 one ; thereby the existing lhc constraints on the sm - like higgs couplings to sm particles are more stringent for the @xmath132 final states  @xcite .",
    "this does not apply to the limit @xmath173 , where the relative sign between @xmath170 and @xmath171 does not play any role . ] .",
    "the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs can even be smaller than @xmath174 ( thus favouring its decay into leptons ) , whereas the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson remains above 20  gev .",
    "it is noteworthy that the solutions allowed by the estimated pass 8 bounds from dsphs always contain a pseudoscalar higgs below 50  gev , and some of them also include a scalar higgs below 60  gev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : masses ] ( right panel ) , we show the mass ranges of the different supersymmetric particles , as well as the higgs sector for the aforementioned solutions . in general , these solutions have a mass spectrum that contains several non sm particles below the frontier of 100 gev .",
    "namely , we can see that neutralinos in these scenarios can be as light as 20  gev while in some cases also the rh neutrinos can reach a mass around 60  gev . notice that the masses of sleptons and squarks do not vary much , since the soft masses and trilinear parameters for these particles were fixed in our scan .",
    "figure  [ fig : inputs ] displays the solutions fitting the gce at 95% c.l . in the planes @xmath171 versus @xmath170 ( left panel ) and @xmath175 versus @xmath176 ( right panel ) , where the main constraint on these parameters is the bound on the @xmath172 mass  @xcite . for @xmath74 final states ( blue )",
    "we observe a slight preference for small values of @xmath170 , while for @xmath77 ( cyan ) and @xmath3 ( grey ) final states the solutions can be found for a wide range of values .",
    "very light pseudoscalar higgses can be found in the peccei - quinn ( pq ) limit @xmath177 and @xmath178 , for which the @xmath179 symmetry is restored , and it is precisely in these regions where we find most of the points that are in agreement with the expected dsph bounds using pass  8 data . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inputs ] , we can observe that these solutions are grouped in the region of @xmath180  gev while the values of @xmath175 do not show any preferred region .",
    "the pq limit is not needed for points that only fulfil pass  7 data as the pseudoscalar mass can be larger .",
    "the nmssm can also accommodate low - mass neutralino dm  @xcite .",
    "several studies have recently pointed out that these neutralinos can also explain the gce  @xcite when they are either singlino / higgsino or bino / higgsino admixtures  @xcite .",
    "the former situation can occur when @xmath181 and requires some degree of fine - tuning in the higgs mass matrix parameters in order to avoid large deviations from the sm - like higgs composition .",
    "moreover , to account for the observed relic abundance the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs must be very close to the resonant condition , @xmath182 .",
    "the bino / higgsino scenario requires @xmath183 and is however less fine - tuned since no resonant condition is required to fulfil the relic density constraint .",
    "the region of the parameter space in which rh sneutrinos can explain the gce is similar to that with singlino / higgsino neutralinos , as @xmath184 ( in fact , light neutralinos are also frequent as we showed in fig.[fig : masses ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , especially when pass  8 constraints are imposed , both models feature a similar higgs spectrum with light singlet - like scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons . nevertheless , in the nmssm with rh sneutrinos the amount of fine - tuning required is largely reduced as resonant annihilation is no longer necessary in order to obtain the correct relic abundance . in this model ,",
    "the annihilation cross section increases when the annihilation channels into light scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons ( @xmath185 and @xmath186 ) are open @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mh1-msn ] , where @xmath187 is represented as a function of @xmath188 for the set of points for which the gce is fit at 95% c.l .",
    "the solid line denotes @xmath189 ( threshold for the annihilation in @xmath74 ) and the dashed line corresponds to @xmath190 ( condition for resonant annihilation ) . only the points with @xmath121 final states require resonant annihilation .    it should finally be emphasized that , contrary to the neutralino case , the parameters that determine the rh sneutrino properties ( the soft mass , @xmath71 , the trilinear term , @xmath191 , and the coupling , @xmath15 ) do not affect the masses of the higgs sector of the nmssm . therefore , it is much easier to obtain the correct relic abundance without violating the lhc bounds .",
    "in this article , we have demonstrated that rh sneutrino dark matter in the nmssm can account for the observed low - energy excess in the fermi - lat gamma - ray spectrum from the galactic centre .",
    "since we are working with a complete theoretical framework , we have also explored the complementarity with other dm search strategies , such as indirect searches for gamma - ray lines , direct dm detection , and the implications for a future lhc run .",
    "more specifically , we have performed a scan in the parameter space of the model , incorporating all the constraints from the lhc as well as direct and indirect dark matter searches . for the latter ,",
    "we have included the fermi - lat bounds on dsphs and gamma - ray spectral features .",
    "in addition , we have estimated the effect of the latest fermi - lat reprocessed data ( pass 8) .",
    "we have computed the gamma - ray spectrum for each point in the parameter space of the model , and then we have performed a @xmath0 fit to the excess .",
    "it should be emphasised that , contrary to usual model - independent approaches , we have taken into account the full annihilation products , without assuming pure annihilation channels .",
    "we have obtained good fits to the gce for a wide range of the rh sneutrino mass , @xmath192  gev , with annihilation cross section in the dm halo @xmath193@xmath7/s at 95% c.l .",
    "there is a large variety of final states for the rh sneutrino annihilation . in general",
    ", we observe that the fit to the gce is good when the rh sneutrino annihilates mainly into pairs of light singlet - like scalar or pseudoscalar higgs bosons , @xmath114 or @xmath113 , that subsequently decay in flight .",
    "these produce spectral features , such as gamma - ray lines and/or box - shaped emissions that improve the goodness of the fit at large energies .",
    "the best fit of our analysis ( @xmath1 ) corresponds to a rh sneutrino with a mass of @xmath194  gev which annihilates preferentially into a pair of light singlet - like pseudoscalar higgs bosons ( with masses of order 60 gev ) .",
    "good fits are also obtained for a variety of mixed final states and have been summarised in table[tab : chi ] .",
    "our estimation of the constraints from the new pass  8 data from fermi - lat rules out all the points that fit the gce at 68% c.l . and",
    "leaves only a few of them within the 95% c.l .",
    "interestingly , these correspond mainly to points with predominant annihilation into light pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "it is remarkable that a region with @xmath108  gev remains valid.in this region , the light pseudoscalar has a small mass , @xmath104 , and therefore leads to a leptonic final state with 4@xmath106 , @xmath107 , which differs from the usual result for @xmath109 .",
    "we have then studied the implications for direct detection of the points that fit the gce at 95% c.l . because of the presence of light non sm particles in the mass spectrum of the model , and the fact that many of our solutions involve resonant annihilation through the lightest scalar higgs , the prospects for the rh sneutrino scattering cross section off quarks span several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is remarkable that many of the points found here are within the reach of next - generation experiments such as supercdms and lz .",
    "interestingly , this is the case of the few points which also survive our estimation of the pass  8 constraints .",
    "we have also investigated the prospects for the detection of these scenarios in future searches for gamma - ray spectral features , using the estimated future sensitivity of fermi - lat for this kind of studies .",
    "we have found that only a small fraction of the points that fit the gce at 95% c.l . will be observable in this way , mainly those associated with resonant annihilation through the lightest or second - lightest scalar higgs boson .",
    "unfortunately , none of the scenarios allowed by our estimation of the pass 8 constraints would be detectable by spectral feature searches .",
    "finally , we have computed the contribution of these scenarios to the invisible and non - sm branching ratios of the sm higgs and compared them with the predicted reach of the future high - luminosity lhc run at 14 tev .",
    "we have determined that a substantial amount of viable scenarios ( many of which also satisfy the pass  8 constraint ) can be probed in such a way .",
    "it is remarkable that many of the scenarios that can explain the gce with rh sneutrino dm can be subject to a complementary detection through other methods in the near future , such as direct dm searches or collider tests of the higgs sector .",

    "<S> we have explored the parameter space of this scenario , computed the gamma - ray spectrum for each phenomenologically viable solution and then performed a @xmath0 fit to the excess . unlike previous studies based on model - independent interpretations , we have taken into account the full annihilation spectrum , without assuming pure annihilation channels . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have incorporated limits from direct detection experiments , lhc bounds and also the constraints from fermi - lat on dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) and gamma - ray spectral lines . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have estimated the effect of the most recent fermi - lat reprocessed data ( pass  8) . in general , we obtain good fits to the gce when the rh sneutrino annihilates mainly into pairs of light singlet - like scalar or pseudoscalar higgs bosons that subsequently decay in flight , producing four - body final states and spectral features that improve the goodness of the fit at large energies . the best fit ( @xmath1 ) corresponds to a rh sneutrino with a mass of 64  gev which annihilates preferentially into a pair of light singlet - like pseudoscalar higgs bosons ( with masses of order 60 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we have analysed other channels that also provide good fits to the excess . finally , we discuss the implications for direct and indirect detection searches paying special attention to the possible appearance of gamma - ray spectral features in near future fermi - lat analyses , as well as deviations from the sm - like higgs properties at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , many of the scenarios that fit the gce can also be probed by these other complementary techniques . </S>"
