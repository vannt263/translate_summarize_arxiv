    "since some decades ago just after the discovery of asymptotic freedom of qcd @xcite the possibility of the existence of a new state of matter in high energy physics is under consideration , namely , a color deconfined phase of quarks and gluons , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the heavy - ion collision experiments at ultra - relativistic energies is to create , under controlled conditions , and understand the properties of this new state of matter .",
    "this opens a new field of study in strong interaction physics .",
    "many experiments have been proposed and accelerators built in the search for the qgp at different energies at sis / gsi , ags / bnl , sps / cern , rhic / bnl and lhc / cern to look for some signs and signatures of the production of the qgp that subsequently hadronizes @xcite .",
    "the study of particle production in ion collisions contribute to the understanding of the conditions under which the quark - gluon plasma may be produced and also to determine the equations of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter .    in hydrodynamical models",
    "the system which arises from a high - energy collision ( fireball ) reaches an approximately local thermal equilibrium ( thermalization ) and expands evolving collectively up to the point when the mean free path of the created and interacting particles becomes large enough for the particles to escape from the fluid , i.e. , the interactions among the particles of the system cease because the system has reached the freeze out point .",
    "the approximately local thermalization is considered due to detailed computations of the expansion stage that takes much longer than the typical scattering times @xcite .",
    "although , non - equilibrium processes are also important for the dynamics , equilibrium processes are a quite good approximation to be used in theoretical models , and are a reasonable first approximation at freeze - out .",
    "some authors consider both the temperature at which the inelastic collisions cease ( chemical freeze - out ) and the elastic collisions cease ( kinetic freeze - out ) @xcite .    in the end of the eighties of the last century the existence of the ( chiral ) critical end point ( cep ) in the qcd phase diagram",
    "was suggested @xcite and since then its properties have been extensively studied @xcite.although , most lattice qcd calculations indicate the existence of the cep for @xmath2  mev @xcite , its exact location is not well known since it depends , for example , on the mass of the strange quark .",
    "the cep separates second - order transition at high temperatures ( or even a smooth cross - over ) from the first - order transition at high chemical potentials in the qcd phase diagram . studying this intermediate region",
    "is a hard task since perturbation theory can not be applied to qcd at this regime and additionally at finite chemical potential the usual lattice approach fails .",
    "moreover , new techniques have been proposed to study lattice qcd at finite t and @xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand the lattice qcd simulations of different groups disagree with each other on the location of the critical end point .",
    "subsequently in the late nineties a hypothesis arose @xcite that the onset of the deconfinement phase transition was located between the top ags and sps energies . the cern energy scan program of the na49 experiment at sps has given signs of a phase change at @xmath4  a@xmath5gev particularly from the horn - like peak in the @xmath6 ratio @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ temp - densb ] ( a ) we have considered @xmath7  mev together with the models nl3 and nl@xmath8 .",
    "the properties of the eos are clearly reflected on these results : for nl3 the transition occurs for smaller densities due to its very large compressibility at large densities .",
    "it is also this high value of the compressibility that dilutes in part the effect of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "nl@xmath8 has a much softer eos and symmetry energy and , therefore , the curves obtained for a fixed asymmetry span a larger range of densities . in summary , the hadron - quark phase transition is favored when the asymmetry of the system is increased .",
    "we are interested in discussing the phase transition at intermediate temperatures and high densities and , for this reason , we consider smaller bag pressures according to fig .",
    "[ mit - cley ] .",
    "we set @xmath9  mev in order to reach a specific range of temperature and densities , which is presented in figs .",
    "[ press - assym - tm1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) and also in fig .",
    "[ press - assym3 ] ( a ) .",
    "the asymmetries experimentally available up to now according to table  [ ion - asymmetries][ion - asymmetries ] are in the range @xmath10 .    since nl3 is too hard and does not satisfy most of the constraints imposed by experimental and observational measurements @xcite we consider in the following tm1 with and without a @xmath11 non linear term which allows us to discuss a asy - soft and a asy - hard eos .",
    "we also take into account the nl@xmath8 parametrization in order to compared with the results already obtained in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ press - assym - tm1 ] we compare tm1 and tm1-@xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to discuss the effect of density dependence of the symmetry energy on the phase transition since the isoscalar channel is kept fixed .",
    "the main effect of a softer symmetry energy is to shift the binodal sections for larger values of the asymmetry parameter to larger densities .",
    "a harder symmetry energy allows the occurrence of the hadron - quark phase transition at smaller densities , and therefore , easier to reach with heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "similar conclusion were drawn in @xcite where the effect of the @xmath12-meson on the phase transition was discussed : the @xmath12-meson gives rise to a harder symmetry energy at large densities favoring the hadron - quark phase transition .    in fig .",
    "[ press - assym3 ] ( a ) we show for the same bag constant the binodal sections obtained with nl@xmath8 .",
    "it is seen that due to a softer eos at intermediate densities the binodal sections occur at larger densities when compared with tm1 .",
    "the effect of the bag constant is clear if we compare fig .",
    "[ temp - densb ] ( b ) with @xmath13  mev with fig .",
    "[ press - assym3 ] ( a ) . a larger @xmath14 shifts the phase transition to much larger densities , showing that in order to obtain a good estimation it is essential to choose an adequate value of @xmath14 .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ press - assym - tm1 ] ( b ) and ( d ) and fig .",
    "[ press - assym3 ] ( b ) a part of figs .",
    "[ press - assym - tm1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) and also fig .  [ press - assym3 ] ( a ) , corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "we also include curves corresponding to the mixed phase with the quark concentrations @xmath16  and @xmath17 which correspond to @xmath18 and @xmath19 of quarks in the mixed phase .",
    "one sees the indication of an interesting region where the phase transition probably occurs and can be probed by intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this region is located in the range @xmath20 and @xmath21  mev and can reached by the new planned facilities ( nica ) at jinr/ dubna @xcite and ( fair ) at gsi / darmstadt @xcite that will start operations in the next few years .    the density behavior at intermediate / high densities defines the transition region .",
    "for instance , models tm1 and tm1@xmath11 would favor the detection of a quark phase more than nl@xmath8 .",
    "we have presented a study of the deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma , which could be formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "calculations at finite temperature with a simple two - phase model and the inclusion of pion and kaon condensation were done in order to describe this type of system .",
    "we have studied the effect of the density dependence of the eos on the phase transition choosing a convenient set of parametrizations of the nlwm .",
    "we have considered both hard and soft eos at intermediate densities as well as models with asyhard and asysoft symmetry energies .",
    "we have also considered the effect of gluons on the quark phase . for the quark phase",
    "we have used the mit bag model and chose the bag constant according to a parametrization of the freeze - out curve deduced from particle multiplicities in heavy - ion collisions @xcite : for deconfinement phase transition at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the bag constant @xmath24 mev was used .",
    "an important result is the difference between the phase diagram for a symmetric system and that for asymmetric matter as observed in liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "usually , the onset of the phase transition takes place at lower baryon densities and temperatures in more asymmetric systems .",
    "this can be probed by means of neutron - rich nuclei in heavy - ion collisions . moreover",
    ", the density at which the phase transition occurs is sensitive to the density dependence of the eos at intermediate densities .",
    "a hard eos gives rise to a transition at lower densities .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy also affects the transition when asymmetric matter is considered .",
    "the phase transition is favored for asymmetric nuclear matter , and even more for an asyhard symmetry energy .",
    "both thermal pions and pion condensation have been included in the calculation .",
    "they mainly play a role at low densities , large isospin asymmetries and large temperatures .",
    "we have considered that the pions couple to the nucleons through the @xmath8-meson @xcite . using an equivalent parametrization for the kaon - meson coupling , which maybe too naive",
    "since it only takes into account the isospin interaction , we have verified that the effect of including strangeness in the hadron phase was negligible for a system with an overall strangeness equal to zero .",
    "this can be generalized to finite strangeness when it becomes possible to prepare heavy - ion collisions with hypernuclei .",
    "it remains to be investigated how sensitive are the results to the pion and kaon interaction .",
    "the results obtained for the phase transition are very sensitive to the eos .",
    "both the isoscalar and isovector interactions have an effect on the transition density . according to the effective models used in this work there exists a region in the parameter space where the phase transition probably occurs and can be probed by heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "this region is located in the range @xmath20 and @xmath25  mev and can be reached by the new planned facilities ( nica ) at jinr/ dubna @xcite and ( fair ) at gsi / darmstadt @xcite that will start operations in the next few years .",
    "we have obtained a larger @xmath26 interval , extending to lower temperatures , for the same densities obtained in @xcite due to the properties of the models used .",
    "a clear sign of a phase transition could be used to constrain both the eos and symmetry energy at intermediate densities .",
    "we have verified that models with a soft eos and soft symmetry energy such as fsu do not predict a hadron - quark phase transition at densities that could be attainned in the laboratory .",
    "a more complete system with all baryons of the baryonic octet and strange mesons , as well as interacting pions and kaons , and using interactions constrained by experimental measurements , is under investigation in order get more systematic results .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnpq ( brazil ) and capes(brazil)/fct(portugal ) under project 232/09 and by fct ( portugal ) under the grants ptdc / fis/64707/2006 and cern / fp/109316/2009 .",
    "r. c. is grateful for the warm hospitality at centro de fsica computacional / fctuc .",
    "it is possible to obtain the respective thermodynamic potential and the eos of the boson fields .",
    "it is convenient to transform @xmath29 into real and imaginary parts using two real fields , @xmath30 and @xmath31 such that @xmath32 @xmath27                    @xmath43[d \\pi_2 ] }   \\int\\limits_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\rm periodic}{[d \\phi_1][d \\phi_2]}\\ ;   \\exp \\left\\ {   \\int_{0}^{\\beta}{d \\tau }   \\int{d^3 x } \\left [   i\\ , \\pi_1 \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial \\tau }    + i\\ , \\pi_2 \\frac{\\partial \\phi_2}{\\partial \\tau }   - { \\cal h}_b + \\mu_b ( \\phi_2 \\pi_1 - \\phi_1 \\pi_2 ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\;,\\ ] ]      where @xmath44 is the boson chemical potential associated with the conserved charge @xmath45 .",
