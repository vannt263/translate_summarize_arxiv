    "the boundary condition has a crucial influence on properties of quantum systems .",
    "for example , the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) realizes a translationally - invariant system with the geometry of the ring or torus , while the open boundary condition ( obc ) results in the chain or cylinder with open boundaries with the boundary - induced modulation such as the friedel oscillations . the thermodynamic properties , i.e. , the expectation values of observables in the bulk of infinite - size systems , are believed to be the same irrespective of the boundary conditions employed . however , the way that the expectation values approach the thermodynamic limit is usually distinct for obc and pbc , which requires a different treatment of finite - size scaling .",
    "furthermore , at the level of the wave function , the difference between the critical systems under obc and pbc remains sizable even at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "that is clearly demonstrated by the different scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in one - dimensional ( 1d ) critical systems with and without open boundaries.@xcite    attempts to control the boundary and finite - size effects have been made in the studies of lattice fermion / spin models .",
    "one example is the so - called smooth boundary condition , which succeeded pretty well in suppressing the boundary effects by smoothly decreasing the energy scales near the edges of the system.@xcite similar but modified boundary conditions were applied to transport problems such as the conductance of 1d interacting systems.@xcite another example is the hyperbolic deformation in which the ground state expectation values of local observables are nearly uniform in the bulk whereas the interaction strength is enhanced rather than suppressed at the boundaries .",
    "@xcite    recently , a more efficient scheme to suppress the boundary effects , which is called the sine - square deformation ( ssd ) , has been proposed for 1d critical systems . in the system with ssd , the energy scale of the local hamiltonian is",
    "rescaled according to the scaling function , @xmath3 , \\label{eq : fx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the length of the system and @xmath1 is the center position of the local hamiltonian .",
    "note that since @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( mod @xmath2 ) , the ssd disconnects the link between the sites at @xmath6 and @xmath2 , resulting in the open edges .",
    "the ssd was first applied to the 1d free - fermion system.@xcite it was found there that in the system with ssd the local observables such as the bond strength are translationally invariant , suggesting that the ssd was able to remove the open - boundary effects almost completely . furthermore , the effects of ssd in several quantum spin models at criticality were examined numerically.@xcite in addition to the translational invariance of the observables such as spin correlations , it was further revealed that the wave - function overlap between the ground state of the open system with ssd and that of the uniform system with pbc is very close to ( almost exactly ) unity .",
    "this means that the ssd does not disturb the periodic ground state at the level of the wave function and keeps the state as the true ground state even after the model hamiltonian loses the translational symmetry by the energy deformation .",
    "this striking feature of the ssd was proven rigorously for the spin-1/2 xy chain , which is equivalent to the free fermions in one dimension.@xcite it has also been shown that the ssd works well for other strongly correlated systems including the 1d hubbard model@xcite and kondo - lattice model.@xcite    while the efficiency of the ssd has been confirmed for several 1d systems , it remains a puzzle why the ground state of the system with ssd is ( almost ) identical to that of the periodic system . since the system with ssd is no longer translational invariant ,",
    "its one - particle eigenstates are distinct from the plane waves . however ,",
    "when ( and only when ) the fermions are filled up to the fermi level , the many - particle ground states of the system with ssd and the uniform periodic system become equivalent .",
    "it is desirable to clarify the mechanism of the ssd to leave the ground state under pbc unchanged .    in this paper , we propose a simple theory which explains how the ssd realizes the energy - scale deformation with keeping the ground state of the original free - fermion model with pbc as an eigenstate .",
    "the key idea is that the amplitudes of active processes in the hamiltonian with ssd vanish , therefore the hamiltonian does not disturb the fermi sea of the original model with pbc . for a certain class of 1d systems , it is also proved that the fermi sea of the original uniform system is not only an eigenstate but also the unique ground state of the hamiltonian with ssd . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , the ground state of the system with ssd",
    "is found to be very close to the fermi sea of the original periodic system accompanied by edge states localized around open edges .",
    "we emphasize that the ssd works well to suppress the boundary effect induced by the obc in any dimensions and in any directions .",
    "the ssd thereby reduces the number of directions under pbc with maintaining the ground - state properties in the bulk .",
    "for example , applying the ssd to a 2d model changes its geometry from a torus to a cylinder , then to a rectangle .",

    "we have observed essentially the same results for the square - lattice model with diagonal hoppings and triangular - lattice model .",
    "the completely flat profiles strongly suggests that the ground state of the systems with ssd is very close to the translationally - invariant ground state of the uniform periodic system superposed by the small disturbance of the edge states .",

    "we have studied effects of the ssd on the free fermion systems .",

    "the ground state of the two- and higher - dimensional systems with ssd can be regarded as a fermi sea of the uniform periodic system superposed by edge - localized states .",
    "as we have shown , in one dimension , the fermi sea is not only an exact eigenstate but also the ground state of the hamiltonian with ssd if the chemical potential @xmath25 is chosen so that @xmath131 for the processes in the ssd hamiltonian allowed by the pauli principle .",
    "one can explicitly confirm this correspondence in a class of exactly solvable spin chains.@xcite it is worth mentioning that the hamiltonian with ssd is distinct from the inhomogeneous integrable models obtained from the quantum inverse scattering method and the algebraic bethe ansatz.@xcite from the point of view of conformal field theory , the chiral hamiltonian has a definite meaning , which accounts for the correspondence between the pbc and ssd hamiltonians in a wide class of 1d critical systems . a detailed discussion will also be given in a subsequent paper.@xcite    our results demonstrate that the ssd works extremely well for free fermions in any dimensions .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the results generalize to systems with interactions . in one dimension ,",
    "it has been confirmed numerically for several strongly - correlated fermion@xcite and spin@xcite systems that the ssd works efficiently to realize the translationally - invariant ground state , and the results are well founded by a field - theoretical analysis.@xcite extending the analysis to multi - leg ladder systems,@xcite and then , to 2d systems must be an intriguing problem .",
    "it would also be interesting to explore the generalizations of other deformations such as the hyperbolic,@xcite exponential,@xcite and sinusoidal@xcite deformations , to higher - dimensional and/or interacting systems .",
    "an experimental study of the ssd in real systems should also be a challenge of great interest .",
    "considering the fact that hopping strength and coupling parameters can be tuned in systems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices as demonstrated in refs .  , they can be promising candidates for the realization of the system with ssd studied in our work .",
