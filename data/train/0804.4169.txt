    "quantum mechanics and classical mechanics provide profoundly different descriptions of the physical world . in one - dimensional classical mechanics one",
    "is given a hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 .",
    "the motion of a particle modeled by this hamiltonian is deterministic and is described by hamilton s equations @xmath6 or equivalently , by newton s law @xmath7 .",
    "the position @xmath8 of a particle at time @xmath9 is found by solving a _ local _ initial - value problem for these differential equations .",
    "the energy @xmath10 of a particle , that is , the numerical value of the hamiltonian , is a constant of the motion and can take on continuous values .",
    "particle motion is restricted to the classically allowed regions , which are defined by @xmath11 .",
    "because a particle may not enter a classically forbidden region , where @xmath12 , a classical particle may not travel between disconnected classically allowed regions .",
    "in quantum mechanics heisenberg s operator equations of motion and the time - dependent schrdinger equation are posed as initial - value problems , just as hamilton s equations are treated as initial - value problems in classical mechanics .",
    "however , the time - dependent schrdinger equation is required to satisfy _ nonlocal _ boundary conditions that guarantee that the total probability of finding the particle is finite . for stationary states",
    "these boundary conditions demand that the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian satisfy a nonlocal boundary - value problem . as a consequence , for a rising potential that confines a classical particle the energy spectrum is discrete .",
    "while classical mechanics consists of nothing more than solving a differential equation to find the exact trajectory of a particle , quantum mechanics is an abstract theory in which the physical state of the system is represented by a vector in a hilbert space and predictions are probabilistic .",
    "the nonlocality mentioned above implies that physical measurements are subtle and difficult to perform .",
    "quantum effects such as discretized energies , tunneling , and interference are a consequence of the nonlocal nature of the theory and are not intuitive .",
    "for example , one can not speak of an actual path that a particle follows when it tunnels from one classically allowed region to another .",
    "complex - variable theory is of great assistance in providing an understanding of nonintuitive real - variable phenomena .",
    "it explains , for example , why the taylor series for a real function @xmath13 may cease to converge at a real value of @xmath14 where @xmath13 is smooth .",
    "( series convergence is linked to the presence of singularities that may lie in the complex plane and not on the real axis . )",
    "moreover , complex analysis shows the fundamental theorem of algebra , which is a deep property of the roots of polynomials , to be nothing more than a straightforward application of liouville s theorem .    the objective of this conjectural paper is to demystify some well - known quantum effects by showing that their qualitative features can be reproduced very simply by the deterministic equations of classical mechanics ( newton s law ) when these equations are extended to and solved in the complex plane .",
    "specifically , we take the uncertainty principle @xmath15 to mean that there is intrinsic uncertainty in the energy of a particle , and in this paper we consider the possibility that this uncertainty may have an imaginary as well as a real part .",
    "we find that a deterministic classical particle whose energy has a small imaginary component can exhibit phenomena that are associated exclusively with quantum mechanics .",
    "we do not necessarily claim that quantum mechanics is a deterministic hidden - complex - variable theory .",
    "indeed , there are important quantum phenomena , such as interference effects , that we can not as yet reproduce by using complex classical mechanics",
    ". however , the results that we obtain by using complex classical mechanics to simulate quantum mechanics bear a striking qualitative and quantitative resemblance to many well - known quantum effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we illustrate the power of complex analysis by using it to explain the quantization of energy .",
    "we show that in the complex domain the energy levels cease to be discrete and energy quantization can be explained topologically as the counting of sheets of a riemann surface . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we describe the general features of classical particle trajectories when the energy of the classical particle is allowed to be complex .",
    "specifically , classical trajectories that are closed and periodic when the energy is real cease to be closed when the energy becomes complex . in secs .",
    "[ s4 ] , [ s5 ] , and [ s6 ] we examine the complex particle trajectories for three potentials whose quantum properties are well studied : the quartic double - well potential @xmath16 , the cubic potential @xmath17 , and the periodic potential @xmath18 . in each of these cases",
    ", we find that the corresponding complex classical system is able to mimic the quantum phenomena of tunneling , bound states of distinct parity , conduction bands , and energy gaps .",
    "section [ s7 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the notion of quantized energy levels is a central feature of quantum mechanics and is a dramatic departure from the continuous energy associated with classical mechanics .",
    "one can gain a different perspective on quantization if one extends quantum theory into the complex domain . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider a simple two - dimensional quantum system whose hamiltonian is @xmath19 where the coupling constant @xmath20 is real .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath21 whose two energy levels are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , describes the unperturbed system .",
    "the interaction is represented by the hermitian off - diagonal matrix @xmath24 the energy levels of @xmath25 are evidently real and discrete : @xmath26 . \\label{e5}\\ ] ]    an elementary way to understand the discreteness of these energy levels is to extend the coupling constant @xmath20 into the complex domain : define the _ energy function _ @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{e6}\\ ] ] as a function of complex @xmath20 , @xmath27 is double - valued , so it must be defined on a two - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "these sheets are joined at a branch cut that connects the square - root branch points located at @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . on the real-@xmath20 axis of the first sheet @xmath30 , and on the real-@xmath20 axis of the second sheet @xmath31 . on the riemann surface",
    "the energy function @xmath27 is smooth and _ continuous _ and is not a quantized function of complex @xmath20 . indeed , along a continuous path that runs from a point @xmath32 on the real axis on the first sheet , crosses the branch cut , and goes to the corresponding point @xmath32 on the real axis on the second sheet , the energy eigenvalue @xmath33 continuously deforms to @xmath34 .",
    "( such a path is shown on fig .",
    "thus , we see that the quantization in ( [ e5 ] ) is a consequence of the topological discreteness of the sheets that make up the riemann surface .",
    "the energy function @xmath27 appears quantized only if we restrict its domain to the real axes on the sheets of the riemann surface .    to summarize",
    ", we have extended the hamiltonian in ( [ e2 ] ) into the complex domain by complexifying the coupling constant @xmath20 and have obtained a clearer and deeper understanding of the nature of quantization .",
    "the topological picture of quantization described here is quite general , and it applies to more complicated systems , such as @xmath35 , which have an infinite number of energy levels @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the advantage of analyzing a system in the complex plane is that special features ( like the discreteness of eigenvalues ) , which only occur on the real axis or which only emerge when we limit our attention to the real domain , can be seen to be part of a simpler and more general framework .",
    "in the rest of this paper we will examine complexified classical mechanics .",
    "we will see that while classical trajectories tend to be closed and periodic when the energy is strictly real , this special feature disappears and trajectories cease to be closed when the energy is allowed to be complex .",
    "open trajectories are generic and , unlike closed trajectories , their behavior is rich and elaborate and bears a strong resemblance to some of the features that are thought to be restricted to the domain of quantum mechanics .",
    "given a classical hamiltonian @xmath36 , the path @xmath8 of a particle is fully determined by hamilton s equations of motion ( [ e1 ] ) together with the initial conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the energy @xmath10 is fixed by these initial conditions and is left invariant under the action of hamilton s equations of motion . in elementary texts on classical mechanics",
    "the initial conditions are taken to be real so that the energy @xmath10 is real and , in addition , particle trajectories are restricted to the real-@xmath14 axis . however , in recent papers on @xmath39-symmetric classical mechanics , it has been shown that it is interesting to study the complex as well as the real trajectories for systems having real energy @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the real - energy trajectories of a classical - mechanical system by using the anharmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is @xmath40 .",
    "the classical trajectories for the energy @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "there are four turning points located at @xmath42 and indicated by dots .",
    "the so - called `` classically allowed '' region is the portion of the real axis between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and a classical particle that is initially on this line segment will move parallel to the real axis and oscillate between the real turning points .",
    "the so - called `` classically forbidden '' regions are the portions of the real-@xmath14 axis for which @xmath45 , and a particle whose initial position is in one of these regions will have an initial motion that is perpendicular to the real axis .",
    "the particle will then enter the complex plane , make a sharp turn about the imaginary turning points , and return to its initial position . by virtue of cauchy s theorem ,",
    "all closed orbits in this figure have the same period @xmath46 .",
    "there are two open orbits that run along the imaginary axis from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and from @xmath49 to @xmath50 in half this time .",
    "note that two different classical trajectories can never cross .",
    "the crucial feature illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is that all of the classical trajectories ( except the two that run off to infinity along the imaginary axis ) are closed .",
    "this means that we can view the system as a sort of complex atom . because the classical orbits are closed , we can quantize the system and calculate the allowed real energies @xmath51 by using the bohr - sommerfeld quantization formula @xmath52 along _ any _ of these closed orbits to obtain the real discrete energy levels of the quantum anharmonic oscillator .",
    "recall that the heisenberg uncertainty principle states that there is an intrinsic uncertainty in the energy @xmath10 .",
    "let us see what happens if this uncertainty in energy implies that it can take complex values . to begin with , since the turning points are determined by the value of the energy , they are slightly displaced from their positions in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . however , the main effect is that while the classical trajectories still do not cross , they no longer need be closed and periodic . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] a single trajectory for a particle whose energy is @xmath53 is shown .",
    "the initial position is @xmath54 and the particle is allowed to travel for a time @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we examine the double - well potential @xmath16 . a negative - energy quantum particle in such a potential tunnels back and forth between the classically allowed regions to the left and to the right of @xmath56 .",
    "let us first see what happens if we put a classical particle whose energy is real in such a potential well .",
    "we give an energy of @xmath57 to this particle and plot some of the possible complex trajectories in fig .",
    "the turning points associated with this choice of energy lie on the real-@xmath14 axis at @xmath58 and @xmath59 and are indicated by dots .",
    "observe that the classical trajectories are always confined to either the right - half or the left - half plane and do not cross the imaginary axis .",
    "therefore , when the energy is real there is no effect analogous to quantum tunneling .",
    "next , we allow the energy of the classical particle to be complex : @xmath60 .",
    "the open classical trajectories that result from such a complex energy are particularly interesting because their behavior is reminiscent of the phenomenon of quantum tunneling .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows a single trajectory that begins at @xmath56 .",
    "the particle moves into the right - half complex plane , and as time passes , the trajectory spirals inward around the right pair of turning points .",
    "the shape of the spiral is similar to that in fig .",
    "after many turns , the particle crosses the real axis between the two turning points and then begins to spiral outward",
    ". eventually , the particle crosses the imaginary axis and begins to spiral inward around the left pair of turning points .",
    "the process then repeats : the particle eventually crosses the real axis , spirals outward , crosses the imaginary axis , and begins to spiral inward around the right pair of turning points .    this process of spiraling inward , spiraling outward , and crossing the imaginary axis continues endlessly , but at no point does the trajectory ever cross itself . during this process",
    "each pair of turning points acts like a strange attractor ; the pair of turning points draws the trajectory inward along a spiral path , but then it drives the classical particle outward again along another nested spiral path .",
    "the classical particle spends roughly half of its time spiraling under the influence of the left pair of turning points and the other half of its time spiraling under the influence of the right pair of turning points .",
    "the classical `` tunneling '' process is less abstract and hence easier to understand than its quantum - mechanical analog . during quantum tunneling",
    ", the particle disappears from one classical region and reappears almost immediately in another classical region .",
    "we can not ask which path the particle follows during this process .",
    "however , for a classical particle , it is clear how the particle travels from one classically allowed region to the other ; it follows a well - defined path in the complex-@xmath14 plane .",
    ".[t1 ] imaginary - axis intercepts , directions , and times for the classical trajectory shown in fig .",
    "each time the trajectory crosses the imaginary axis we register the intercept in the first column , the direction of motion in the second column , and the time in the third column .",
    "this table becomes its mirror image under spatial reflection , so we classify the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] as having odd parity . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parities of the quantum eigenfunctions associated with the double - well potential @xmath16 alternate as the energy varies monotonically .",
    "analogously , we have found that the parities of the classical trajectories also alternate as the real part of the energy changes monotonically .",
    "in this section we examine the cubic hamiltonian @xmath61 , which is a model for a quantum particle in a long - lived metastable state .",
    "this particle is initially confined to the classically allowed region in the parabolic portion of the potential , but it eventually tunnels through the barrier and then moves rapidly off to @xmath62 .",
    "this hamiltonian serves as an archetypal model for radioactive decay .",
    "the energy levels of this hamiltonian have been calculated for small @xmath63 by using wkb theory @xcite , and the approximate formula for the ground - state energy is @xmath64 the reciprocal of the imaginary part of the energy is an approximate measure of the lifetime @xmath65 of the metastable state : @xmath66    let us examine what happens to a classical particle under the influence of this potential .",
    "first , we choose @xmath67 and give this particle a _ real _ energy @xmath68 . because this energy is real , the particle trajectories are closed and periodic ( see fig .  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "periodic trajectories can not represent a physical tunneling process in which a particle , initially confined in a potential well , gradually leaks out to infinity .",
    "next , we allow the energy of the particle to have an imaginary component .",
    "we take @xmath69 and set @xmath70 .",
    "this choice lifts the two outer turning points slightly above the real-@xmath14 axis and pushes the central turning point below the axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] . the trajectory on the left represents a classical particle that starts at the origin and goes until @xmath71 , while the trajectory on the right runs until @xmath72 .",
    "observe that the classical particle begins its motion by spiraling outward under the control of the two left turning points , which mark the edges of the confining region .",
    "after some time , the third turning point gradually takes control .",
    "we observe this change of influence as follows : initially , as the particle crosses the real axis to the right of the middle turning point , its trajectory is concave leftward , but as time passes , the trajectory becomes concave rightward .",
    "it is clear that by the fifth orbit the right turning point has gained control , and we can declare that the classical particle has now `` tunneled '' out and escaped from the parabolic confining potential .",
    "the time at which this classical changeover occurs is approximately at @xmath73 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the lifetime of the quantum state in ( [ e8 ] ) , whose numerical value is about 20 .",
    "a periodic potential is used to model the behavior of a quantum particle in a crystal lattice . when the energy of such a particle lies below the top of the potential",
    ", there are infinitely many disconnected classically allowed regions on the real axis .",
    "ordinarily , a quantum particle is confined to one such region , but has a finite probability of tunneling to an adjacent classically allowed region .",
    "thus , such a particle hops at random from site to adjacent site in the crystal .",
    "however , for a narrow band ( or bands ) of energy the particle may drift freely from site to site in one direction . in such a _ conduction band _ the motion of the particle",
    "is said to be _",
    "delocalized_.    a classical particle in such a periodic potential exhibits these characteristic behaviors , but only if its energy is complex . if its energy is taken to be real , the particle merely exhibits periodic motion and remains confined forever to just one site in the lattice .",
    "figure [ f9 ] illustrates this periodic motion for a particle of energy @xmath74 in a @xmath18 potential .",
    "for the same potential , if we take the energy to be complex @xmath75 , the classical particle now executes localized hopping from site to site ( see fig .  [ f10 ] ) . in this figure",
    "the particle starts at the origin @xmath56 and `` tunnels '' right , right , left , left , left , left , left , right , and so on , without ever crossing its trajectory .",
    "this deterministic `` random walk '' is reminiscent of the behavior of a localized quantum particle hopping randomly from site to site in a crystal .",
    "the tunneling rate of the classical particle depends on the imaginary part of its energy . to measure the time required for the particle in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] to hop to an adjacent site , we simply count the number of turns in the spiral path contained in each cell .",
    "this gives an extremely accurate measure of the time the particle spends in each cell before it hops to an adjacent cell .",
    "if we then vary the imaginary part of the energy and plot the relationship between @xmath76 and the tunneling time , we obtain the graph shown in fig .",
    "we see from this graph that the product of @xmath77 and the tunneling time is a constant . in units",
    "where @xmath78 , for the time - energy quantum uncertainty principle this product should be greater than @xmath79 , and this lower bound is saturated by the harmonic oscillator .",
    "measured for the @xmath18 potential , we find that the numerical value of this product is approximately @xmath80 .    we have found that there is a narrow range for the real part of the energy in which the classical particle in the @xmath18 potential behaves as if it is a delocalized quantum particle in a conduction band ; that is , the classical particle drifts consistently from site to site in the potential in one direction . a classical trajectory that illustrates this behavior is shown in fig .  [ f12 ] .",
    "the energy of this particle is @xmath81 .",
    "the band edges can be determined with great numerical precision ; we find that when @xmath82 , the range of real energy in this band is @xmath83 .",
    "the classical differential equations that we have solved numerically in this paper can be solved exactly in terms of elliptic functions , but we have not done so because we are interested in their qualitative behavior only .",
    "their solutions seem to suggest that many features thought to be only in the quantum arena can be reproduced in the context of complex classical mechanics .",
    "of course , we have not shown that _ all _ quantum behavior can be recovered classically . in particular , we have not yet been able to observe the phenomenon of interference .",
    "( for example , we do not yet see the analog of the nodes in bound - state eigenfunctions . )",
    "the ideas discussed here might be viewed as a vague alternative version of a hidden - variable formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the original idea of de  broglie , bohm , and vigier was that a quantum system can be reduced to a deterministic system in which probabilities arise from the lack of knowledge concerning certain hidden variables .",
    "this approach encountered various difficulties , but an alternative way forward was suggested by wiener and della riccia @xcite , who argued that the hidden quantity in a coordinate - space representation of quantum mechanics is not the classical position of the particle but rather the momentum variable , which is integrated out and thus circumvents the issues associated with traditional approaches . in order to obtain the quantization condition , wiener and della riccia introduced probability distributions over the classical phase space , thus obtaining the spectral resolution of the liouville operator in terms of the eigenfunctions of the associated schrdinger equation .",
    "the complex energy formulation of classical mechanics outlined here , if viewed as an alternative hidden variable theory , is close in spirit to that of wiener and della riccia , but is distinct and more primitive in that we have not introduced probability distributions over the classical phase space .",
    "nevertheless , the inaccessibility of the imaginary component of the energy in classical mechanics might necessitate introducing a probability distribution for the energy , which in turn might give rise to a more precise statement of uncertainty principles .",
