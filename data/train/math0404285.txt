    "in this subsection , we review the relevant facts about homogeneous spaces and their schubert stratification which we will use in this paper .    to set the stage , let @xmath5 be the algebraic homogeneous space @xmath1 where @xmath72 is a semisimple group and @xmath73 is a parabolic subgroup .",
    "we pick @xmath74 a maximal torus , @xmath75 a borel subgroup such that @xmath76 .",
    "our convention is that the lie algebra @xmath77 contains all the negative roots with respect to some choice of a weyl chamber .",
    "we let @xmath78 denote the unipotent subgroup of @xmath72 whose lie algebra is the sum of all positive root spaces .",
    "we let @xmath79 be the weyl group and @xmath80 be the hesse diagram of @xmath81 .",
    "we consider the decomposition of @xmath5 coming from the maximal torus action on @xmath5 .",
    "this action has isolated fixed points indexed by the elements of the hasse diagram @xmath80 .",
    "the corresponding _ plus _ bialynicki - birula stratification coincides with the more familiar schubert decomposition : @xmath82 we let @xmath83 be the orbit @xmath84 and we let @xmath85 be its closure .",
    "@xmath85 is a subvariety of @xmath5 whose codimension equals the length @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath85 can be written as union of lower dimensional strata ( where @xmath88 refers to the bruhat ordering ) : @xmath89    the codimension @xmath0 cells @xmath85 are important to us .",
    "they are in one to one correspondence with the _ simple _ roots @xmath47 of @xmath90 not contained in @xmath81 , the corresponding @xmath87 being the reflection @xmath91 across the wall @xmath47 . the cycle @xmath92 corresponds to the points of @xmath5 which flow to @xmath93 as @xmath94",
    ". the @xmath95 s can also be described by the zeros of holomorphic sections of some very ample line bundles @xmath96 .",
    "we can write any class @xmath7 in the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the codimension @xmath0 class @xmath99=c_1(l_{\\alpha})$ ] for each simple root @xmath47 not in @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , each simple root @xmath47 determines a rational curve in @xmath5 joining @xmath73 to @xmath93 .",
    "the class of this rational curve is dual to the class of @xmath95 .",
    "the rational curve can be parametrized as : @xmath100 similarly , such @xmath74 invariant curves in @xmath5 can be generated for all positive ( not necessarily simple ) roots @xmath47 which are not in @xmath81 ; all @xmath74 invariant curves passing through @xmath73 are obtained this way . more generally , a @xmath74-invariant rational curve joining two general fixed points @xmath101 and @xmath102 exists provided @xmath103 for some root @xmath47 not in @xmath81 .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to prove the following result about the generators of the rational codimension @xmath0 chow group of @xmath6 .",
    "[ gmodp ]    the codimension @xmath0 chow group with rational coefficients of @xmath6 is generated by the following classes :    * boundary divisors of nodal maps , the degrees and marked points being distributed arbitrarily on the two components .",
    "* evaluation classes @xmath104 for each @xmath105 and each simple root @xmath47 which is not contained in @xmath81 , * kappa classes @xmath106 where @xmath107 ( so that @xmath85 has complex codimension @xmath4 in @xmath5 )",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* as a corollary of localization and the rationality of the moduli space of stable maps we easily see that the rational picard group , the rational codimension @xmath0 chow group and the complex codimension @xmath0 rational cohomology all coincide , essentially because the same is true for the fixed loci .",
    "this was explained in @xcite is greater detail . in this paper",
    "we will use chow groups / cohomology interchangeably , but in the proof of this proposition it is more convenient to make use of the chow group of @xmath108 .",
    "we let @xmath109 be the complement in @xmath5 of all classes @xmath85 with @xmath110 .",
    "we also let @xmath111 be the open dense cell of the schubert decomposition .",
    "it can be defined as follows : @xmath112    we consider the following subschemes of @xmath113 :    1 .   the codimension @xmath0 boundary divisors .",
    "2 .   the subscheme of maps intersecting @xmath85 for all @xmath87 with @xmath107 .",
    "3 .   the subscheme of maps with markings in @xmath95 for all simple roots @xmath47 .",
    "the subscheme of maps which cut @xmath95 with multiplicity higher than @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that the complement of all these subschemes is the locus @xmath114 of maps @xmath115 with the following properties :    * the domain curve is irreducible , * the image of the map is contained in @xmath109 , * the markings of @xmath116 map to @xmath111 , * @xmath116 intersects @xmath95 transversally .",
    "we claim that the chow group @xmath117 .",
    "it follows then that the four types of classes @xmath118 span the space of divisors . to complete the proof it remains to show that the classes in item @xmath119 are indeed among the generators we enumerated in the proposition .",
    "the subscheme in item @xmath119 can be described as the image of the cycle @xmath120 on @xmath121 under the map @xmath122 forgetting the last marking . here , @xmath120 is the gathmann space of stable maps with contact order at least @xmath4 with the very ample hypersurface @xmath95 ( see @xcite for the relevant definitions ) . due to the fact that @xmath95 is a very ample , there is an embedding @xmath123 .",
    "the following equation : @xmath124=\\phi^{\\star}\\pi_{\\star } \\left[{\\overline m}_{\\bullet}^{\\p^{n-1}}(\\p^{n } , \\phi_{\\star}\\beta)\\right]\\ ] ] holds in the chow group of @xmath125 ( see @xcite , theorem 2.6 ) .",
    "here @xmath126 denotes the corresponding gathmann space of maps to @xmath127 with contact order @xmath4 at the hyperplane @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to show that on @xmath125 the pushforward class @xmath129 $ ] is in the span of the corresponding classes we claimed as generators .",
    "that is , we need to show this class is a sum boundary divisors , @xmath21 classes and evaluation classes @xmath130 , and then observe that these classes pullback to similar classes under @xmath131 .",
    "however , this statement is already proved by pandharipande ( @xcite ) who in fact enumerated all divisor classes for @xmath132    to prove the vanishing of @xmath133 we first consider the case when @xmath134 .",
    "we let @xmath135 and @xmath136 in fact @xmath137 is the big fixed locus for the @xmath74 action on @xmath113 .",
    "the embedding @xmath138 ( and similarly @xmath139 ) is obtained as follows :    * we consider a stable curve with @xmath140 marked points .",
    "this will be a contracted component of the stable map whose image is the origin @xmath73 of @xmath5 .",
    "we make the first @xmath45 marked points of the stable curve be the marked points of the stable map to @xmath5 .",
    "* at the @xmath141 marked points we add @xmath142 s of degree @xmath0 mapping to the rational curve joining @xmath73 to @xmath143 constructed in the beginning of this section .",
    "we let @xmath144 proposition 2 of @xcite shows that @xmath114 is an open subvariety of @xmath145 .",
    "it is enough to show @xmath146 .",
    "let @xmath147 be a @xmath74-equivariant resolution of singularities for @xmath113 .",
    "the image of restricted map @xmath148 lies in the smooth ( automorphism - free ) locus of @xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath122 is an isomorphism over the smooth locus , we obtain an inclusion @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 be the subset of @xmath151 of points flowing to @xmath152 .",
    "since , @xmath122 is an isomorphism on @xmath152 , we have @xmath153 .",
    "now , @xmath154 can be chosen to be a composition of blowups , so we conclude that @xmath155 is surjective .",
    "it is enough to show @xmath156 .",
    "this follows easily , since @xmath151 is smooth and for smooth varieties , it is well known that @xmath150 is a bundle over the fixed set @xmath152 .",
    "thus the claimed vanishing of @xmath157 follows from the vanishing of @xmath158 .",
    "this is well known , it can be derived , for example from keel s result that the boundary classes generate all codimension one classes on @xmath159 .",
    "to finish the proof we have to analyze each of the remaining cases when @xmath160 individually .",
    "then @xmath152 is to be interpreted as a point , and as long as this point has no automorphisms in the moduli space @xmath113 we are done by the same arguments as before .",
    "there are four cases to consider .",
    "we will briefly show the argument for @xmath161 .",
    "the remaining cases can be obtained as in theorem 3 in @xcite , by adding more marked points to place ourselves in the case we already discussed .",
    "we let @xmath162 be the open subscheme of @xmath163 consisting in maps with image in @xmath109 such that all @xmath68 markings map to @xmath95 with multiplicity @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that @xmath164 .",
    "it is therefore enough to show @xmath165 .",
    "now , let @xmath166 be an equivariant resolution of singularities for the closure @xmath167 of @xmath162 in @xmath168 . since @xmath162 is smooth we can view it as a subscheme of @xmath166 .",
    "the arguments of proposition @xmath4 in @xcite show that all @xmath169 flow to a unique map @xmath170 .",
    "this map @xmath171 has an internal component of degree @xmath46 mapping to @xmath73 to which we attach external components of degree @xmath98 , each of them having a marked point mapping to @xmath143 .",
    "therefore @xmath171 sits in the smooth part of @xmath167 and we can therefore regard it as an element in @xmath166 .",
    "let us look at the subvariety @xmath172 of points of @xmath166 flowing to @xmath171 under the @xmath24 action .",
    "@xmath162 is contained in @xmath172 by the above discussion .",
    "now since @xmath166 is smooth , @xmath172 is an affine space .",
    "therefore @xmath165 , as desired .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition",
    ".      this subsection will contain another way of finding divisor classes on the space of maps to the grassmannian @xmath5 parameterizing @xmath173 dimensional projective subspaces of @xmath174 .",
    "the method is quite ad - hoc and it involves decomposing the space of stable maps into pieces we understand better . the author could not make this procedure work for other flag manifolds .",
    "we seek to reprove the generation result of the previous subsection .",
    "let @xmath175 and @xmath176 denote the tautological and quotient bundles on @xmath5 .",
    "we let @xmath79 be a copy of @xmath177 ( given by the vanishing of the first @xmath178 homogeneous coordinates ) .",
    "then the subvariety @xmath179 has codimension @xmath180 .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath181 and @xmath182 $ ] generate the complex codimension @xmath4 classes on @xmath5 .",
    "the complement of @xmath172 parametrizes subspaces @xmath183 in @xmath184 .",
    "the key observation is that @xmath184 can be understood as the total space of the bundle @xmath185 since the fibers of @xmath122 are affine spaces , the @xmath173 dimensional subspace @xmath183 contained in @xmath186 projects to a @xmath173 dimensional subspace @xmath187 in @xmath188 i.e. @xmath189 gives an element of the projective space @xmath188 of @xmath173 dimensional subspaces of @xmath188 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath186 can be described as a bundle @xmath145 over @xmath188 whose fiber over a subspace @xmath189 is @xmath190 .",
    "an easy argument , involving the euler sequence identifies this bundle with @xmath191 .",
    "the long exact sequence in cohomology induced by the euler sequence shows that this bundle is convex .",
    "that is , for any morphism @xmath192 we have @xmath193 .",
    "we define @xmath114 to be the subscheme of @xmath194 parameterizing stable maps @xmath116 whose images intersect @xmath172 .",
    "the open set @xmath195 consists in maps whose images are contained in the total space @xmath186 of the bundle @xmath196 .",
    "proposition 2.1 in @xcite and the convexity of the bundle @xmath145 imply that @xmath195 is in fact a bundle over @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , @xmath198 .",
    "this last group is well known , it has been computed by pandharipande in @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case when @xmath199 or @xmath200 , the generators are the boundary divisors and the class @xmath201 .",
    "this implies that the boundary divisors and the class @xmath202 on @xmath6 restrict to generators for @xmath203 . to get all divisors classes on @xmath204 we need to add the class @xmath205=\\pi_{\\star}ev_{n+1}^{\\star } \\left[\\mathcal v\\right]$ ]",
    "a similar argument works for @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "we recover the statement of proposition @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we will focus explicitly on the case of divisor classes on the space of maps to @xmath2 flag varieties .",
    "we will start by restating the results of the previous section for @xmath2 flags , then describe relations between the generators we found and finally prove their independence by a dimension computation .      to set the stage ,",
    "we let @xmath5 be the flag variety parameterizing quotients of a vector space @xmath26 of fixed dimensions @xmath207 , or equivalently of subspaces of @xmath26 of dimensions @xmath208 : @xmath209 there is a tautological sequence on @xmath5 given by @xmath210 we let @xmath211 denote the kernel of the map @xmath212 for all @xmath213 , where by convention @xmath214 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is well known that the chern classes @xmath215 form a basis for @xmath216 for @xmath217 .",
    "we let @xmath218 denote the dimension of this vector space .",
    "each stable map to @xmath5 will have a multi - degree @xmath219 determined by the above generators of @xmath220 .",
    "similarly , @xmath221 is generated by the classes @xmath222 together with the _ nonzero _ chern classes @xmath223 .",
    "there is only one relation between these generators : @xmath224    we enumerate",
    "the generators we obtained in proposition @xmath225 :    1 .   boundary classes .",
    "we have @xmath226^{+}-1 - n$ ] such boundaries",
    "@xmath21 classes @xmath227 and all classes @xmath30 when @xmath32 has rank at least @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   evaluation classes @xmath228 , for each @xmath12 and @xmath217 .",
    "now , these generators turn out not to be independent .",
    "we exhibit relations between them .",
    "we start with the boundary classes .",
    "the obvious way of getting relations is to pull back relations from @xmath229 under the forgetful map : @xmath230 there are @xmath231 boundary classes on @xmath229 but there are @xmath232 independent relations between them .",
    "this cuts down the number of independent classes in @xmath233 to at most @xmath226^{+}-1-\\binom{n}{2}$ ] , with equality when all relations come from @xmath229 .",
    "next , we consider the classes of type @xmath234 .",
    "when @xmath235 , we pick @xmath236 an ample generator and pick @xmath237 large enough such that the bundles @xmath238 are all very ample .",
    "we will replace the bundles @xmath239 in @xmath234 by their very ample counterparts @xmath240 .",
    "note that the span of the classes in @xmath241 and @xmath234 will be not be affected by this change .    when @xmath199 and when @xmath242 all divisor classes , including the corresponding evaluation classes of type @xmath234 , are spanned by boundaries and the @xmath21 class @xmath243 .",
    "this is the contents of lemma 1.1.1 in @xcite . using the linear system",
    "@xmath244 we get an _ embedding _ of @xmath5 into a projective space . pulling back under this map",
    ", we can therefore conclude that the class @xmath245 is in the span of boundaries and of @xmath21 classes , which will necessarily be on the list @xmath241 .",
    "when @xmath199 we will henceforth dispense with the classes @xmath234 .    when @xmath36 a different discussion is needed .",
    "we use lemma 2.2.2 in @xcite quoted as equation @xmath246 below . pull back the relation provided by the lemma under the embedding given by the linear system @xmath244 .",
    "then , modulo boundary classes the following relation holds for some constants @xmath247 : @xmath248 it follows that the span of the evaluation classes @xmath249 is exactly @xmath0 dimensional modulo boundaries and the @xmath21 classes in @xmath241 ( for example @xmath250 is a generator of the one dimensional span . intersecting with suitable curves or restricting to a copy of @xmath251 and invoking the results of @xcite , it can be shown this class is independent from the boundaries ) .    for @xmath37 ,",
    "a similar discussion as above shows that the span of the evaluation classes in @xmath234 is at most @xmath4 dimensional modulo boundaries and the kappa classes in @xmath241 .",
    "the classes @xmath250 and @xmath252 can be chosen as generators for the two dimensional span ( alternatively we can pick pairs of evaluation classes ) .",
    "however , corollary 1 in @xcite rewritten as equation @xmath253 below shows that the sum of these two classes is also in the span of the boundaries .",
    "it follows that the span of the evaluation classes @xmath234 is exactly @xmath0 dimensional modulo boundaries and @xmath21 classes",
    ". we immediately conclude that for all values of @xmath45 , the combined contribution of the classes in @xmath233 and @xmath234 is at most @xmath226^{+}-1-\\binom{n}{2}$ ] .    finally , the classes of type @xmath241 are also connected by relations .",
    "lemma @xmath22 of the next subsection shows that @xmath254 can be expressed in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath255 modulo boundaries .",
    "in fact , applying this lemma to each pair @xmath256 we derive that the following equation is true modulo boundaries : @xmath257 using @xmath258 , we easily arrive at the following relation : @xmath259 the coefficients of the boundary terms can be written down explicitly , but they    to summarize , we obtain the following upper bound for the dimension of the space of divisors on @xmath6 : @xmath260^{+ } - 1 - \\binom { n}{2}+h^{4}(x ) - \\binom { h^2(x)}{2}.\\ ] ]    in section @xmath261 , we will use localization to give a lower bound for the dimension of the space of divisors . in fact , we will prove that the bound obtained above is sharp",
    ". this will give the proof of theorem @xmath0 stated in the introduction .",
    "we will now indicate the statement and proof of the lemma invoked in the previous subsection to find relations between the @xmath21 classes .",
    "we hope this lemma could also be of use to understand divisors on product spaces .",
    "[ relation ] let @xmath262 be two line bundles on a projective variety @xmath5 . then the following @xmath21 class on @xmath263 : @xmath264 is in the span of the boundary divisors .    *",
    "* we claim that it is enough to prove the statement for @xmath189 and @xmath265 very ample . indeed , assuming we proved the statement in this case",
    ", we pick a very ample divisor @xmath236 on @xmath5 . for @xmath45 large enough , @xmath266",
    "will both be very ample .",
    "we obtain that @xmath267 is in the span of boundaries .",
    "clearing denominators , and then looking at the term independent of @xmath45 , we derive that the @xmath21 class in the statement of the lemma is also in the span of boundaries .",

    "let @xmath277 denote the boundary divisor of maps with nodal target such that the bidgree of the map on one of the components is @xmath278 ; then the bidgree on the other component is @xmath279 .",
    "the lemma will then follow pulling back under @xmath280 the following relation on @xmath281 : @xmath282 * claim .",
    "* as a first step in establishing @xmath283 , we show that the codimension @xmath0 classes on @xmath284 are in the span of the boundaries and of the two kappa classes @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "the boundary in @xmath281 is a divisor with normal crossings .",
    "it follows from the deligne spectral sequence that the cokernel of the gysin map @xmath287 can be identified with the weight @xmath4 piece of the hodge structure on the cohomology of the open stratum @xmath288 .",
    "we will show this is at most two dimensional .",
    "we will write the open stratum @xmath289 as a global quotient and make the computation in equivariant cohomology .",
    "let @xmath26 be a two dimensional space so that @xmath290 comes with the obvious @xmath291 action .",
    "the space of maps @xmath292 of bidgree @xmath293 is an open set in the product of two projective spaces @xmath294 we need to factor out the action of @xmath291 on the two factors to obtain @xmath295 .",
    "equivalently , we can think of @xmath296 as sitting in a quotient of the affine space @xmath297 by the action of the group @xmath298 .",
    "the action of @xmath299 is the usual one on the two factors , while @xmath24 acts in the usual way only on the second factor , and trivially on the first .",
    "this action is easily seen to have finite stabilizers .",
    "it is well known that in such cases we have an isomorphism between the cohomology of the orbit space and equivariant cohomology : @xmath300 both sides have hodge structures ( for equivariant cohomology , we need to use finite dimensional approximations of the equivariant models ) compatible with the above isomorphism .",
    "moreover , @xmath301 sits inside the space @xmath302 this space is the total space of a bundle over the product of two classifying spaces @xmath303 .",
    "the restriction map @xmath304 is surjective .",
    "therefore @xmath305 is at most @xmath4 dimensional .",
    "the surjectivity of the map can be explained by the usual arguments in @xcite , using ( grothendieck s ) remark @xmath68 of that paper .",
    "our * claim * follows if we show that the two classes @xmath285 and @xmath286 are not in the linear span of the boundary divisors .",
    "this is done in @xcite , lemma 1.2.1(i ) by intersecting with curves in the moduli space in the case of @xmath174 , but the argument goes through without change for @xmath306 .",
    "the claim we just proved suffices to establish the results needed in this paper .",
    "however for the sake of completeness , we will also prove the precise relation @xmath283 .",
    "it follows from what we proved above that a linear combination of the three classes : @xmath307 to identify the coefficients of this relation it is enough to intersect @xmath308 with curves in @xmath309 .",
    "a moment s thought shows that it is enough to check @xmath283 for all curves of @xmath113 transversal to the boundary .",
    "indeed , assuming this is the case , we show that @xmath308 and an appropriately scaled version of @xmath283 coincide .",
    "subtracting the two equations , we get an expression involving only @xmath285 , @xmath310 and boundary classes .",
    "this expression vanishes on each curve in @xmath113 transversal to the boundary .",
    "we have seen already in the proof of the claim that this implies that the coefficients of the @xmath21 s must vanish .",
    "it is not any harder to conclude the same about the coefficients of the boundary classes . without appealing to the * claim * above , simply by intersecting with the smooth curves of @xmath113 .",
    "we actually do this in the proof below for curves transversal to the boundary .",
    "the general argument should not be more complicated . ]",
    "it remains to show @xmath283 holds after intersecting with the smooth curves intersecting the boundary divisors transversally .",
    "let us now consider such a curve .",
    "this is the same as a family of stable maps to @xmath311 parametrized by a one dimensional base @xmath75 :    @xmath312    it can be proved that @xmath313 is the blow up of a projective bundle @xmath314 at the points @xmath315 where @xmath75 meets the boundary divisors .",
    "we let @xmath316 be the exceptional divisors of the blowups and we let @xmath317 .",
    "we assume that the map @xmath318 has bidegree @xmath319 on each exceptional divisor @xmath316 .",

    "<S> we conjectured that the cohomology of these moduli spaces is entirely tautological and proved this conjecture for @xmath2 flags . in this note , we bring more evidence in favor of our conjecture , establishing it completely for general flag varieties in codimension one , using a different method .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , let @xmath5 be a projective homogeneous space . </S>",
    "<S> the ( coarse ) moduli spaces @xmath6 parametrize marked stable maps to @xmath5 in the cohomology class @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these moduli spaces are related by a complicated system of natural morphisms which we enumerate below :    * : @xmath8 @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> * , @xmath10 * evaluation morphisms to the target space , @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the system of tautological classes on @xmath6 is defined as the smallest subring of @xmath13 ( or of the chow ring @xmath14 ) with the following properties :    * the system is closed under pushforwards and pullbacks by the natural morphisms . * </S>",
    "<S> all monomials in the evaluation classes @xmath15 for @xmath16 are in the system </S>",
    "<S> .    typical examples of tautological classes are the following . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath17 be cohomology classes on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the class @xmath18 is defined as the pushforward via the forgetful projection @xmath19 : @xmath20    one of the main results of this note is the following :    [ gmodpa ] let @xmath5 be any projective homogeneous space . </S>",
    "<S> all ( rational coefficient ) complex codimension @xmath0 classes on @xmath6 are tautological . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit system of generators can be written down .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain sharper results for @xmath2 flag varieties . </S>",
    "<S> these results generalize pandharipande s ( @xcite ) who worked out the case of maps to projective spaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , pandharipande s argument does not extend to this setting , essentially because there is no convenient description of the space of morphisms to flag varieties which is suitable for computations . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we propose a different approach : the previous proposition gives generators for the codimension @xmath0 rational chow group . </S>",
    "<S> we cut down the number of generators by exhibiting relations between the various @xmath21 classes on @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to lemma @xmath22 for the precise equations . we show independence of the remaining classes by a dimension calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation involves two ingredients : localization and a computation of the symmetric group invariants on the second cohomology of moduli spaces of marked rational curves . </S>",
    "<S> this latter computation is similar to getzler s ( @xcite ) ; the exact result is contained in lemma @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument will enumerate all the @xmath24 fixed loci on @xmath6 which have at most one negative weight on their normal bundle .    to explain our result in more detail , we let @xmath5 be the @xmath2 flag variety parameterizing @xmath25 successive quotients of fixed dimensions of a vector space @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the tautological sequence on @xmath5 : @xmath27 we will prove that :    [ diva ] the following classes span the second cohomology group / codimension @xmath0 chow group with rational coefficients of @xmath6 :    * the boundary divisors , * the classes @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and the * nonzero * classes @xmath30 for @xmath31 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 is the kernel of @xmath33 , and , by convention , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> * when @xmath36 or @xmath37 , we add any one of the evaluation classes @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> the class @xmath39 is sum of boundary classes . </S>",
    "<S> all other relations between these generators come from @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 - 1 - \\binom { n}{2}+h^{4}(x ) - \\binom { h^2(x)}{2 } .\\ ] ] here @xmath42 are the second and fourth betti numbers of @xmath5 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 $ ] denotes the integer part .    pandharipande s arguments ( @xcite ) show that all top intersection numbers of these divisors can be expressed as certain @xmath45 point genus @xmath46 primary gromov - witten invariants of @xmath5 . for projective spaces , these invariants can be inductively computed from the kontsevich - manin reconstruction theorem ( @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the next easiest case , that of the grassmannians of dimension @xmath4 subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the genus @xmath46 invariants determine all higher genera ( descendant ) invariants . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the intersection numbers on the moduli spaces of stable bundles over curves of arbitrary genus , or certain intersection numbers on the quot scheme can be expressed in terms of the genus @xmath46 gromov - witten invariants of grassmannians ( @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , kontsevich - manin reconstruction does not apply in this case . </S>",
    "<S> however , as a corollary of our study of the tautological rings , we will obtain a reconstruction result which we now explain . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by finding a relation between codimension @xmath4 evaluation classes , which is identical to the one exhibited in @xcite in codimension @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ evala ] for all codimension @xmath4 classes @xmath47 on a general grassmannian @xmath48 , the following codimension @xmath4 class on @xmath49 : @xmath50 can be written explicitly as a sum of classes supported on the boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this proposition relies on a dimension computation of the complex codimension @xmath4 cohomology , which combines localization and the deligne spectral sequence . as a second step , we enumerate all codimension @xmath4 classes on the moduli space of maps using the main theorem in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the number of generators with the actual dimension of their span to explain the existence of one relation between various evaluation classes . to identify the relation explicitly we will investigate how it restricts to the space of maps to projective spaces . </S>",
    "<S> this will require a better understanding of the codimension @xmath4 classes on the space of maps to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove the following :    [ codimensiona ] one can write down an explicit basis for the complex codimension @xmath4 cohomology of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> similar statements can be made for @xmath0 or @xmath4 marked points and for general grassmannians . </S>",
    "<S> these bases are described in propositions 3.a - d .    </S>",
    "<S> once proposition @xmath53 is established , we can derive a reconstruction theorem for the genus @xmath46 primary gromov - witten invariants of the grassmannian @xmath48 of @xmath4 dimensional subspaces .    </S>",
    "<S> [ reconstructiona ] ( i ) all genus @xmath46 gromov witten invariants of the grassmannian of @xmath4 planes can be reconstructed from the invariants @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the second chern class of the tautological quotient bundle and @xmath56 are arbitrary cohomology classes .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) for any number of marked points @xmath45 and any degree @xmath57 , there is a constant @xmath58 such that if @xmath59 then all genus @xmath46 , degree @xmath57 , @xmath45 point gromov witten invariants of @xmath48 can be explicitly computed .    </S>",
    "<S> we can rephrase the above result in terms of the gromov - witten potential as follows . </S>",
    "<S> fix @xmath60 a basis for the cohomology of @xmath48 which is coupled to the coordinates @xmath61 of the small phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we make the convention that @xmath62 and we write @xmath63 for the coordinates @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the gromov - witten potential @xmath65 is defined as the power series : @xmath66    the genus @xmath46 gromov - witten potential on the small phase space of @xmath48 is determined by the initial conditions : @xmath67    similar statements can be made for a larger class of smooth projective varieties ( see remark @xmath68 ) .    of course , </S>",
    "<S> the genus @xmath46 gromov - witten potential satisfies complicated differential equations such as the wdvv equations . </S>",
    "<S> these differential equations can essentially be derived from the topological recursion relations ( trr ) . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to understand how the above corollary fits in with the constraints on the potential enumerated above . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that corollary @xmath0 and proposition @xmath53 are again consequences of the trr . </S>",
    "<S> even more generally , one could perhaps hope that all relations in the tautological rings are obtained as consequences of the trr . </S>",
    "<S> theorem 1 above provides supporting evidence .    </S>",
    "<S> our paper is organized as follows . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> , we will prove proposition @xmath69 and check our result explicitly in the case of grassmannians . </S>",
    "<S> in the second section we discuss the case of @xmath2 flag varieties . </S>",
    "<S> there , we prove theorem @xmath0 stated above . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the last part of the paper is devoted to the proof of theorem @xmath70 which will follow quite formally after establishing proposition @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs of propositions @xmath53 and @xmath71 will be achieved in the third section .    </S>",
