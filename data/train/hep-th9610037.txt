    "matrix models have proved to be useful tools to understand several important issues in string theory and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that large classes of random matrix models are equivalent , in the so - called planar limit ( number of components @xmath11 ) , to discretized models of euclidean 2-dimensional gravity , or equivalently to discrete non - critical bosonic strings .",
    "critical points exist , which allow to take a continuum limit .",
    "some of these models are exactly solvable , and their continuum limit is 2-d gravity coupled to matter with central charge @xmath0 , or equivalently bosonic strings in @xmath12 ( in a linear dilaton background ) .",
    "explicit results are in agreement with other approaches , such as quantization in the conformal gauge ( liouville theory ) @xcite or in the light - cone gauge @xcite , or topological gravity @xcite .",
    "the so - called double scaling limit @xcite allows to sum over topologies of the 2-d world sheet , and to deal with non - perturbative issues in string theory .",
    "one of the still poorly understood issue is the nature of the so - called @xmath1 barrier .",
    "no explicit solution is known for matrix models which describe @xmath1 unitary matter coupled to 2-d gravity .",
    "moreover , the predictions of continuum theories for @xmath0 become meaningless in the domain @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the kpz formula @xcite for the string exponent @xmath13 and for the scaling dimensions of matter operators lead to unphysical complex values when @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath1 barrier is not simply a technical problem , since it is related to the occurrence of tachyons for bosonic strings in @xmath14 .",
    "alternative quantizations methods for strings in @xmath14 lead only to partial results @xcite , and liouville theory allows only to construct consistent theories for @xmath15 @xcite , which are nevertheless difficult to interpret in terms of physical ( non - topological ) strings .",
    "the nature of the @xmath1 phase has been investigated by numerical simulations .",
    "the simplest case is dynamical triangulations in @xmath16-dimensional space ( 2-d gravity coupled to @xmath16 massless free bosons , with @xmath17 ) @xcite . for large values of @xmath16 ( typically @xmath18 )",
    ", these studies point toward a branched polymer phase , with a string susceptibility exponent @xmath6 ( besides  pathological \" phases with highly singular curvature defects ) .",
    "this confirms semi - rigorous @xcite and more heuristic arguments @xcite which shows that if @xmath19 the model is  generically \" in a branched polymer phase with susceptibility exponent @xmath6 .",
    "however for smaller values of @xmath20 ( typically @xmath21 ) numerical simulations point towards an intermediate phase with @xmath22 , without discontinuity at @xmath7 .",
    "another class of models consists in multiple ising spins on dynamical triangulations @xcite . at the order - disorder transition point , one recovers a @xmath23 theory ( @xmath24 being the number of spins ) . here also for @xmath25 but not too large @xmath13 is found to increase smoothly with @xmath20 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , without discontinuity at @xmath28 . for large @xmath24 ,",
    "the ordered and disordered spin phases ( with the pure gravity behavior @xmath29 ) are separated by an intermediate branched polymer phase with @xmath6 , where the spins are already disordered @xcite .",
    "the transition between the ordered pure gravity phase and the disordered branched polymer phase is a branching transition with @xmath30 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for @xmath31-states potts models when @xmath31 is large @xcite , and is expected for o(@xmath24 ) models when @xmath24 is large @xcite ( but on flat 2-d space these models are non - critical at the order - disorder transition for @xmath32 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "analysis of @xmath33 models by series expansions give qualitatively similar results @xcite .",
    "so if for large values of @xmath20 the behavior of all these models is generically ( i.e. without fine tuning ) that of branched polymers , for smaller values of @xmath1 the situation is still very unclear",
    ". this lead several authors to conjecture that for @xmath1 but small there exists an intermediate behavior , with @xmath22 , intermediate between the kpz regime and the branched polymer regime @xcite , while it is also argued that very large finite size effects may occur as @xmath8 .",
    "another approach is the large @xmath2 renormalization group ( rg ) introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a change @xmath34 in the dimension of the matrix ( the string coupling constant ) can be absorbed into a change in the couplings @xmath35 of the matrix model .",
    "this defines a renormalization group flow , with fixed points which describe the continuum limit .",
    "calculations at lowest order in perturbation theory give a picture of the rg flow in agreement with exact results for @xmath3 models .",
    "however the agreement is only very qualitative .",
    "the positions of the critical points and the values for the critical exponents are quite different from the exact results .",
    "for some @xmath3 models one can use the equations of motion to write new non - linear rg equations which lead to the exact critical points and exponents @xcite , but this rely heavily on the solvability of these models , and can not be extended to the interesting non solvable cases .",
    "in addition these equations are non - linear and not really in the wilsonian spirit .    in this article",
    "i want to show that the @xmath1 barrier can be simply understood in this rg framework , if one takes into account the so - called touching ( or branching ) interactions in the matrix models .",
    "the scenario that i propose relies on already known results and on a few natural assumptions .",
    "it leads to a simple explanation of the characteristics of the @xmath1 barrier , and of the numerical results for @xmath1 , and might be of some relevance for higher dimensional models .",
    "touching ( or branching ) interactions generate random surfaces which touch at isolated points , i.e. produce a microscoping  wormhole \" connecting two world - sheets . in matrix models they correspond to products of traces of powers of the matrices .",
    "for instance , the simplest matrix model with such interactions , first introduced in @xcite , has for action @xmath36\\ = \\",
    "n\\,{\\rm tr}\\left({\\phi^2\\over 2}-g{\\phi^4\\over 4}\\right)\\,-\\,{x\\over 2}\\ , \\left({\\rm tr}\\left({\\phi^2\\over 2}\\right)\\right)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is an @xmath38 hermitean matrix .",
    "the @xmath39 term in the action generates the usual random surfaces made of squares , while the @xmath40 term allows two surfaces to be glued along an edge .",
    "it can be solved exactly , and its phase diagram is depicted on fig.1 .",
    "starting from the @xmath41 , @xmath42 bipz critical point there is a critical line which corresponds to pure 2-d gravity ( @xmath43 ) , characterized by the string exponent @xmath29 .",
    "this line ends at the end - point @xmath44 , @xmath45 , characterized by the exponent @xmath30 .",
    "then is becomes a branched polymer critical line , with @xmath6 , which passes through @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "these features persist for @xmath48 matrix models with touching interactions @xcite .",
    "when the touching coupling constant @xmath49 is switched on , the 2-d gravity critical line , characterized by the exponent @xmath50 given by the kpz formula , ends at a end - point , characterized by the new positive exponent @xcite @xmath51 and becomes for higher @xmath49 a branched polymer critical line , with @xmath6 .",
    "there is an interesting conjecture @xcite that the continuum limit of the modified matrix model at the end point is still a liouville theory , but with ( some ) positive gravitational dressings of operators replaced by the negative gravitational dressings .",
    "it is possible to study touching interactions with the rg approach of @xcite .",
    "this is a natural idea , since @xmath52 terms are naturally generated by the rg flow at second order in perturbation theory .",
    "it is quite simple to apply the method of sect .  4 of @xcite to the model ( [ sqrtraction ] ) , and to obtain the 1-loop rg flow equations .",
    "one rewrites the action ( [ sqrtraction ] ) as @xmath53\\ = \\",
    "n\\,{\\rm tr}\\left({\\phi^2\\over 2}(1-b)-g{\\phi^4\\over 4}\\right)\\ , + \\,{n^2\\over 2}\\,{b^2\\over x } \\,+\\,n^2\\,\\rho\\ ] ] with @xmath54 an auxiliary variable , and @xmath55 an additional trivial coupling constant , which normalizes the vacuum energy .",
    "starting from an @xmath56 matrix , one integrates over the last line @xmath57 and row @xmath58 of the matrix , after rewriting the @xmath59 term in the action in terms of the auxiliary variable @xmath60 @xmath61 and one obtains an effective action @xmath62 for the remaining @xmath38 matrix @xmath37 . for large @xmath2",
    "the variation of action is @xmath63\\ = \\",
    "{ \\rm tr}\\left({\\phi^2\\over 2}(1+b)-g{\\phi^4\\over 4 } + { \\rm log}(1+b+g\\sigma - g\\phi^2)\\right)\\ , + \\,n\\,\\left ( { b^2\\over x}+g{\\sigma^2\\over 2}+2\\rho\\right)\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath64 we may expand the second order in @xmath65 , and replace @xmath60 and @xmath54 by their saddle point values in @xmath66+\\delta s[\\phi]$ ] @xmath67 we thus generate @xmath68 , @xmath39 and @xmath69 terms in @xmath70 . rescaling @xmath37 in order to keep the @xmath68 term fixed , we find that the variation of the action amounts to a renormalization of @xmath65 , @xmath49 and @xmath55 , which defines the 1-loop @xmath71-functions @xmath72 of course the fact that the action ( [ sqrtraction ] ) remains closed under rg transformation is true only at 1-loop .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath55 is unimportant at that stage , and is usually neglected .    the corresponding rg flow in the @xmath73 plane is depicted on fig .  2 .",
    "the arrows goes from large @xmath2 to small @xmath2 .",
    "besides the gaussian attractive fixed point @xmath74 , we recover the pure gravity fixed point of @xcite at @xmath75 , which has one unstable direction , as expected .",
    "in addition , we find a purely repulsive fixed point at @xmath76 and another critical fixed point at @xmath77 .",
    "the interesting conclusions that we draw are : _",
    "( i ) _ we indeed obtain a rg flow which mixes @xmath39 and @xmath40 terms ; _ ( ii ) _ there are two critical points , i.e. two possible critical behavior for the model ; and _ ( iii ) _ the two corresponding critical lines are separated by a tricritical point . however , when compared with the exact phase diagram of fig .  1 , there are qualitative differences .",
    "we expect that the @xmath78 fixed point corresponds to the branched polymer critical behavior , since the @xmath47 line has an enlarged @xmath79 symmetry , and is thus stable under the rg flow . in the first order calculation",
    ", it has two unstable directions and is thus multicritical , while from the exact result we find that the true @xmath80 branched polymer critical point is critical , and should have only one unstable direction .",
    "one should nevertheless remember that the position of the critical points obtained by this first order rg calculation differs from the exact positions by @xmath81 , and that the error on the critical exponents , and on the stability of the fixed points , is very large .",
    "what lessons can be drawn from this simple calculation for @xmath82 matrix models ? we know from exact results that for @xmath83 the phase diagram in the @xmath84 plane ( where @xmath65 is the cosmological constant coupling and @xmath49 the branching coupling ) is generically similar to that of fig .  1 .",
    "if we assume that the large-@xmath2 rg picture stays valid , the corresponding rg flow is schematically depicted on fig .",
    "3 . there are two critical fixed points with one unstable direction , the first one ( a ) corresponds to non - critical string , the second one ( b ) is on the @xmath47 line and corresponds to branched polymers . in between on the critical surface there is a multicritical point ( c ) , with two unstable directions , which corresponds to the modified matrix model .",
    "the properties of the rg flow near the two fixed points a and c can be easily deduced from the exact results .",
    "let us first consider the 2-d gravity fixed point a , and linearize the rg flow around a , by mapping the couplings @xmath85 into the renormalized couplings ( i.e. the scaling fields ) @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 is the usual cosmological constant , and @xmath88 the renormalized branching coupling , other @xmath89 s correspond to possible other couplings . in terms of the new couplings @xmath90 , the singular part of the vacuum energy",

    "taking one derivative with respect to @xmath88 amounts to insert one  wormhole \" , i.e. to take two planar surfaces with one puncture and to glue them at the punctures ( see fig .",

    "this scenario for the rg flows near @xmath7 leads to a simple picture for the @xmath1 phase .",
    "the pair of fixed points @xmath129 simply disappear , and the rg flow is schematically depicted on fig .  5 .",
    "the only critical fixed point is then the branched polymer fixed point b , and the whole critical line in the @xmath84 plane is attracted toward b. this means that even if one starts without touching interactions ( @xmath130 they are generated by the rg and drive the model in the branched polymer phase .",
    "this picture is in agreement with the results of the numerical simulations for large @xmath20 , but also explains the situation for @xmath20 small . for @xmath131 but not too large ,",
    "the pair of fixed points become a complex conjugate pair of fixed point , not too far in the complex plane from the real critical surface .",
    "it is expected that there will be a strong slowing - down of the rg flow in this region of the critical surface close to the complex fixed points ( depicted as the shaded area @xmath132 on fig .",
    "5 ) . in this region",
    ", the rg flow for @xmath1 should look very much like the rg flow close to @xmath133 for @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that if one considers the matrix model without touching interactions ( @xmath41 ) , as the cosmological constant coupling @xmath65 approach its critical value @xmath134 , there will be a large crossover region , up to some @xmath135 smaller than ( but close to ) @xmath134 , where the rg trajectory takes - off from the critical surface in @xmath132 , with an effective rg eigenvalue @xmath136 . in this domain , asymptotic scaling",

    "one can still simplify the rg flow equation ( [ betacone ] ) into @xmath139 ( with @xmath140 and where @xmath141 denotes the derivative w.r.t the rg  time \" , i.e. the logarithm of the rescaling factor ) this approximation is valid for @xmath142 small and @xmath89 close to the @xmath7 fixed point @xmath143 . from ( [ toyrgx ] ) , for @xmath144 the  time \" needed to pass the @xmath95 barrier ( i.e. to go from the initial condition @xmath145 to the branched polymer fixed point at @xmath146 ) is @xmath147 and from ( [ toyrg0 ] ) during this crossing the most relevant coupling @xmath87 inflates by a factor @xmath148 .",
    "therefore if one start from @xmath149 , in order to reach the vicinity of the bp fixed point at @xmath150 one must start from a @xmath151 .",
    "this crude argument should nevertheless give the size of the true scaling domain , which is exponentially small when @xmath8 latexmath:[\\[\\label{asympscal }    this implies that the real branched polymer scaling should be unobservable in practice if @xmath9 is not large enough , and that one observes the cross - over effective scaling with @xmath153 .",
    "this scenario should be quite robust , and is in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "in the above section i have considered only the cosmological constant coupling @xmath65 and the branching coupling @xmath49 , assuming that it is enough to fine - tune @xmath65 ( i.e to make @xmath154 ) to make the model critical .",
    "thus the above discussion and the phase diagram of fig .",
    "5 apply typically to the non - critical string in @xmath155 space , that is to the gaussian model where @xmath16 massless free bosons are coupled to 2-d gravity .",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated for multicritical models , where more than one coupling have to be fine - tuned to obtain a critical theory .",
    "a typical example is the multiple ising spins model , which has been extensively studied .",
    "i shall show that the r.g .",
    "flow picture advocated in the previous section applies as well to this case , and leads to a simple and natural explanation of the numerical results .",
    "let me first consider the @xmath156 case . in this discretized model ,",
    "one considers a ferromagnetic ising model on a dynamical triangulation ( in practice the spins live on the faces of the surface ) . in the model without branching the model has two couplings , the usual string coupling @xmath65 , and the spin temperature @xmath157 ( the symmetry is not broken explicitly by an external magnetic field ) . for fixed @xmath157",
    "there is a critical coupling @xmath158 where the geometry becomes critical ( infinite area ) . at this @xmath158 , at low temperature ( @xmath159 ) the spins are in an ordered phase and the fluctuations of the spins are not critical , so the fluctuations of the geometry are that of pure gravity ( @xmath43 , @xmath160 ) . at high temperature ( @xmath161 )",
    "the spins are in a disordered phase , and the fluctuations of the metric are still that of pure gravity . at the critical point",
    "@xmath162 the fluctuations of the spins are critical , and it is well known that in the continuum limit one gets gravity coupled to the @xmath163 minimal model ( free fermions ) , with @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to add touching interactions in this model , so that one gets a model with @xmath65 , @xmath157 and the branching coupling @xmath49 as coupling constants .",
    "the phase diagram for such models was already studied in @xcite .",
    "let me give a schematic description of the critical surface : this means that @xmath65 is adjusted to its critical value @xmath165 where the fluctuations of the geometry are critical , and the structure of the critical surface is studied as a function of @xmath157 and @xmath49 . for @xmath166",
    "the spins are frozen and for @xmath167 they are decoupled from the geometry , so in both cases one recovers a phase diagram similar to that of the one matrix model as @xmath49 increases . for @xmath49 small",
    "the system is in the pure gravity phase @xmath29 , until it reaches the branching transition @xmath168 , and for large @xmath49it is in the branched polymer phase @xmath6 .",
    "now if one considers the ising critical point ( @xmath162 ) , as @xmath49 is increased it spans a critical line @xmath169 , characterized by the @xmath163 gravity behavior @xmath164 , until the branching transition multicritical point is reached . at this point",
    "the string exponent is @xmath170 , as given by ( [ gammabar ] ) . for higher @xmath49",

    "the transitions are just ordinary branching transitions with @xmath30 . moreover at these transitions one expects that the spin fluctuations are never critical .",
    "the argument that i used to estimate the size of the scaling domain in @xmath1 models can be easily adapted to estimate the width of the funnel , that is the size @xmath186 ( in spin temperature ) of the intermediate branched polymer phase .",
    "one finds that it is exponentially small when @xmath185 , @xmath187 and in addition the size of the scaling domain in the most relevant coupling @xmath65 , for which the branched polymer scaling and the branching transitions are observable , still scales as ( [ asympscal ] ) .",
    "this explains why this scaling has not been observed in numerical simulation and series analysis for moderate values of @xmath24 , and why in practice one measures effective scaling exponents @xmath188 intermediate between the @xmath7 scaling @xmath189 and the branched polymer behavior @xmath6 .",
    "finally a similar picture is valid for q - states potts models and for the @xmath190 interacting loops models .",
    "for @xmath191 or @xmath183 one expects a rg flow similar to that of fig .",
    "however at @xmath192 or @xmath28 one knows from the flat space results that the ordinary critical fixed point will coalesce with the ordinary tricritical fixed point , since in flat space the transition is first order for @xmath32 or @xmath25 .",
    "so for the models coupled to gravity , i expect that as @xmath193 or @xmath185 the critical f.p .",
    "* a * will coalesce with an ordinary tricritical f.p .",
    "@xmath194 _ and _ with the critical branching f.p .",
    "* c * , and that they all disappear for @xmath32 or @xmath25 .",
    "the logarithmic corrections to scaling at @xmath7 will be more complicated , but the rg flow for @xmath32 or @xmath25 will be qualitatively similar to that of fig .  10 .",
    "this explains the qualitative similarity between the behavior of the multiple ising spins models , potts models and o(@xmath24 ) models at @xmath1 .",
    "however it seems that for all these models the fluctuations of the matter fields are never critical , and just drive some geometrical transitions of pure gravity .",
    "in conclusion , i have proposed a scenario for the @xmath1 barrier in non - critical strings , based on the inclusion of touching interactions and on a rg analysis .",
    "this scenario is simple , generic , and in agreement with exact and numerical results .",
    "however , let me stress that it is still conjectural . in particular , further numerical studies are needed in order to test the scaling laws that it predicts for @xmath195 .",
    "let me end with a few more general remarks on the role of touching interactions in discrete gravity .",
    "i have argued that it is necessary to include such interactions in 2-d gravity , since they are generated by the large @xmath2 rg procedure of @xcite for matrix models .",
    "in fact there is another equally valid reason to take them into account . in the dynamical lattice approach of 2-d gravity",
    ", there has been several ( mostly numerical ) attempts to perform real space renormalization @xcite .",
    "this amounts to replace a block of neighboring cells of the random lattice by a single , larger cell .",
    "a problem with such procedures is that they inevitably lead to touching points , since a small  bottleneck \" can be replaced by a single vertex , thus generating wormhole - like configurations .",
    "some real - space renormalization procedures consist in removing such touching points , when they connect a small surface ( a  baby universe \" ) to the parent surface @xcite . from the point of view that i presented here , it is perhaps better to keep these configurations , and to include branching interactions from the beginning in these models .    another interesting question is to understand if touching interactions have a simply stringy interpretation . for instance , i do not know if the scaling dimension @xmath119 of the  wormhole operator \" in the modified matrix model can be reproduced by that of a local operator in liouville theory .",
    "these remarks may also apply to higher dimensional models , which have been used to discretize 3-d and 4-d euclidean gravity .",
    "the numerical simulations on dynamical 3-d and 4-d triangulations show a phase transition between a negative curvature phase and a positive curvature phase which bears similarities with the branched polymer phase of 2-d gravity .",
    "it is quite possible that touching interactions are needed to understand this transition .",
