    "discrete conformal geometry was essentially born when william thurston recognized that the existence of circle packings could be interpreted in terms of approximating a riemann map @xcite .",

    ", extremal length essentially measures the aspect ratio of the rectangle to which it can be mapped conformally and with vertices preserved .",
    "the definition carries to the discrete setting in a natural way , and it too has a nice geometric interpretation . schramm and cannon , floyd , and parry @xcite showed that the extremal metric is realized by a tiling by squares of a rectangle whose aspect ratio is the extremal length . the circle packing and square tiling models provide alternate paths to discretization of conformal geometry and",
    "behave very differently as convergence to the riemann map and preservation of extremal length separate into geometrically distinct notions in the discrete setting ( c.f .",

    "extremal length generalizes naturally to higher dimensions .",
    "our goal in this paper is to pursue the connection between extremal length and square ( now cube ) tilings beyond two dimensions .",
    "we should expect some trouble , as classical conformal geometry loses much of its depth in dimension three .",
    "nonetheless , hersonsky was able to show in @xcite that three - dimensional cube tilings do indeed realize the extremal length of a discrete parallelepiped , closely following schramm s approach .    to prove that a square tiling exists realizing any discrete quadrilateral , schramm used planarity in an essential way .",
    "moving to three dimensions , hersonsky captured this use of planarity in a condition called the triple intersection property .",
    "a cube tiling realizing the extremal length of a discrete parallelepiped will exist if the triple intersection property is satisfied , whereas no conditions on the graph are necessary in dimension two .",
    "we will show that the triple intersection property is too strong to realize a cube tiling and thus that the two - dimensional arguments will not generalize .",
    "this shows that discrete conformal mappings in dimension three are far more restrictive than in dimension two , mirroring the classical result that three - dimensional conformal mappings are mbius transformations .",
    "nonetheless , cube tilings certainly do exist and we explore some necessary conditions on a graph to realize a tiling .",

    "one forms a finite - dimensional vector space over the vertices of the graph and recognizes a metric as an element of this vector space . by normalizing to unit area , searching for an extremal metric amounts to maximizing a continuous function on the unit sphere .",

    "a _ cube tiling _ of a geometric box @xmath15 by a discrete box @xmath16 is a collection of @xmath2-dimensional cubes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 and any two cubes that intersect do so along their boundaries .",

    "in other words , @xmath28 contributes its measure in proportion to the volume @xmath50 of one of its faces .",
    "noting also that the volume of @xmath37 is @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 now employ hlder s inequality with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , giving @xmath55    we also have @xmath56 and @xmath57 , so @xmath58 since @xmath19 is extremal , @xmath59 is maximal and thus so too must be @xmath60 .",

    "topological arguments and a volume calculation then show that the cubes must form a tiling .",
    "a discrete box satisfying schramm s condition admits a tiling by cubes whose side lengths are determined by the extremal metric .",
    "schramm first presented the details of this argument in dimension two in @xcite .",
    "hersonsky was able to generalize the rest of schramm s proof to dimension three in @xcite ( with the added assumption that the top and bottom faces be squares ) , and indeed the arguments could be generalized to finite dimensions with some extra bookkeeping . the problem is thus reduced to satisfying schramm s condition .    to meet schramm s condition ,",
    "any shortest path connecting the top to the bottom must intersect each of the @xmath65 . to see this , note that @xmath67 captures the shortest of all such paths and @xmath68 will not depend on @xmath69 if any one top - to - bottom path misses @xmath70 , obliterating the derivative .",
    "schramm s condition is trivially met in dimension two , since any path connecting two opposing sides of a topological quadrilateral will necessarily intersect any path connecting the other two sides .",

    "then the discrete line @xmath78 misses @xmath70 , contradicting the triple intersection property .    the only way a collection of squares whose intersecting edges are parallel can fill the rectangular @xmath37 is if they are congruent squares laid in a line , in this case connecting @xmath79 to @xmath80 . but this violates the assumption that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are disjoint , since this configuration connects @xmath81 to @xmath82 with a single cube .",
    "notice that our proof never referenced the path @xmath72 , meaning that requiring even one cross - path to hit all top - bottom paths is prohibitive .",
    "the argument clearly carries to higher dimensions as well .",
    "the upshot of theorem  [ th : tip ] is that schramm s condition , while trivially satisfied in dimension two , is too strong to induce analogous tilings in higher dimensions .",

    "repeating this process indefinitely on these smaller boxes can produce cube tilings with great combinatorial complexity .",
    "the contacts graph of such tilings ( perhaps with some edges and null - weight vertices added to make it a triangulation ) will give extremal metrics by theorem  [ th : extremal ] , but there is no known method to recover the tiling from the combinatorics .",
