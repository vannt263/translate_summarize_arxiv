    "the 1.68-ev photoluminescence ( pl ) center was reported many decades ago in diamond@xcite and where later it was assumed @xcite that silicon impurities were involved in this center .",
    "this was confirmed by pl measurements at cryogenic temperature on si - doped chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) polycrystalline diamond samples where the fine structure of the 1.68-ev pl center could be detected.@xcite a 12-line fine structure is observed close to 1.68  ev , and this can be divided into three similar groups each containing four components .",
    "the relative strengths of the optical absorption for the three groups of lines are found to be the same as the ratio of the abundancies of the natural isotopes of silicon , @xmath0si , @xmath1si , and @xmath2si@xcite .",
    "the 4-line fine structure for an individual si - isotope is assigned to doublet levels both in the ground and excited states which split by about 48 and 242  ghz , respectively.@xcite it has been assumed that this small splitting might be explained by dynamic jahn - teller effect@xcite and/or by spin - orbit effect.@xcite    recently , single photon - emission from 1.68-ev pl center has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "its zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) with 5  nm width even at room temperature and the near infrared emission makes this pl center very attractive candidate for quantum optics@xcite and biomarker@xcite applications .",
    "spin - polarized local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) within density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in a very small nanodiamond model ( with @xmath370 carbon atoms ) concluded that the negatively charged split - vacancy form ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) of siv defect ( siv@xmath4 ) is responsible for the 1.68-ev pl center.@xcite they exclude the neutral siv defect ( siv@xmath5 ) as a good candidate as its ground state is orbitally singlet.@xcite this model was later disputed based on a semiempirical restricted open - shell hartree - fock cyclic cluster model calculation where they claimed that tunneling of si - atom along the symmetry axis may occur for siv@xmath5 defect that can explain the doublet line in the ground state.@xcite    the fingerprint of siv@xmath5 was found by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) studies.@xcite the kul1 center with @xmath6 high spin ground state and d@xmath7 symmetry@xcite was recently associated with siv@xmath8 defect where 216-atom lda supercell calculations produces relatively good agreement with the measured @xmath9c and @xmath0si hyperfine couplings ( see tab .",

    "very recently , thorough epr and pl studies have been carried out to correlate the kul1 epr center with an 1.31-ev pl center , and its relation to the 1.68-ev pl center.@xcite the final conclusion was that siv@xmath8 has a zpl at 1.31-ev whereas siv@xmath4 has a zpl at 1.68-ev .",
    "photo - conductivity measurements@xcite and photo - ionization measurements@xcite indicate that the adiabatic ( thermal ) charge transition level of @xmath10 level of siv defect is at @xmath11 + 1.5  ev , where vbm is the valence band edge .",
    "while the recent measurements@xcite are very plausible still no _ ab initio _ theory was able to conclusively support the assignment of 1.68-ev center with the negatively charged siv defect .",
    "lda or any semilocal generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functionals suffer from the band gap error@xcite which inhibits to directly compare the calculated and experimental zpl energies .",
    "recent advances in dft functionals made possible to accurately calculate zpl energies and charge transition level of defects in diamond and other semiconductors.@xcite in this paper , we apply this theory to study the charge transition levels and the zpl energies of siv defect in diamond .",

    "parameters for the supercell calculations were established first by using the gga exchange of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite in bulk calculations on the primitive cell with a 8@xmath158@xmath158 monkhorst - pack ( mp ) set for brillouin - zone sampling.@xcite ( increasing the mp set to 12@xmath1512@xmath1512 has changed the total energy by @xmath160.002  ev . ) constant volume relaxations using a cutoff of 370(740 )  ev in the plane - wave expansion for the wave function ( charge density ) resulted in an equilibrium lattice parameter of @xmath17= 3.570   . increasing the cutoff to 420 ( 840 )",
    "ev has changed the lattice constant by only 0.003   .",

    "the hse06 values presented here differ somewhat from those in refs .  ,",
    "but tests on the negatively charge nitrogen - vacancy center ( nv ) have shown that the higher cutoff would cause only negligible difference in the equilibrium geometry of that defect too .",
    "defects in the supercell were allowed to relax in constant volume till the forces were below 0.01  ev /  .",
    "we calculated the hyperfine tensors of @xmath9c and @xmath0si isotopes within paw formalism@xcite as implemented in vasp 5.3.2 package . here , we applied a larger 500(1000 )  ev cutoff for the plane wave ( charge density ) expansion .",

    "@xmath27 is the nuclear bohr - magneton of nucleus @xmath28 and @xmath29 the electron bohr - magneton .",
    "the fermi - contact term is proportional to the magnitude of the electron spin density at the center of the nucleus which is equal to one third of the trace of the hyperfine tensor , @xmath30 .",
    "the fermi contact term arises from the spin density of unpaired electrons with @xmath31-character , and can be quite sizable . the spin density built up from unpaired electrons of @xmath32-character yields the dipole - dipole hyperfine coupling .",
    "the fraction of fermi - contact and dipole - dipole term implicitly provides information about the character of the wave function of the unpaired electron as well as the corresponding nuclei ( via @xmath33 ) . according to our recent study@xcite the contribution of the spin polarization of core electrons to the fermi - contact hyperfine interaction@xcite is significant for @xmath9c isotopes ,",
    "thus , we include this term in the calculation of hyperfine tensors .",
    "the excitation energies were calculated within constrained dft method that was successfully applied to nv center in diamond.@xcite in this method one can calculate the relaxation energy of the nuclei due to optical excitation .",
    "the formation energy of the defect with defect charge state @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 by ignoring the entropy contributions , where @xmath36 is the total energy of the defect in the supercell , @xmath37 is the calculated energy of vbm in the perfect supercell , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the chemical potentials of c and si atoms in diamond with @xmath40 number of c atoms in the supercell , @xmath41 is the chemical potential of the electron , i.e. , the fermi - level , and @xmath42 is the correction needed for charged supercells .",
    "the thermal charge transition level between the defect charge states of @xmath34 and @xmath43 is the position of the fermi - level ( @xmath41 ) in the fundamental band gap of diamond where the formation energies are equal in these charge states .",

    "was applied for @xmath42.@xcite recently , this scheme was found to work best for defects with medium localization.@xcite",
    "we first study the structure and the obtained defect levels by hse06 calculation .",
    "then , we apply group theory in order to explain the symmetry of the defect states .",
    "we use the calculated thermal ionization energies , excitation energies and hyperfine couplings to identify the 1.31-ev and 1.68-ev pl centers .",
    "we also discuss the results with comparing them to the experiments .",
    "we first calculated the neutral defect siv@xmath8 by substituting the c - atom by a si - atom adjacent to a nearby vacancy .",
    "the si automatically left the substitutional site creating a split - vacancy configuration which may be described as a si - atom placed in a divacancy where the position of the si - atom is equidistant from the two vacant sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) .",
    "the position of si - atom is a bond center position which is an inversion center of perfect diamond lattice . in our special coordinate frame",
    "the two vacant sites reside along the [ 111 ] direction of the lattice which has a @xmath45 rotation axis .",
    "the symmetry of the defect may be described as @xmath46 or @xmath12 , where @xmath47 is the inversion .",
    "we note that nv center has @xmath48 symmetry with no inversion .",
    "the defect has @xmath6 high - spin ground state .",
    "this finding agrees with the lda calculations.@xcite after establishing the symmetry of the defect one can apply group theory analysis for this defect.@xcite .",
    "one can build the defect states of this defect as an interaction between the divacancy orbitals and the si - impurity states .",
    "the si impurity has 6 immediate neighbor c - atoms in divacancy",
    ". the calculated distance between si- and c - atoms is about 1.97    in the neutral charge state , which is longer than the usual si - c covalent bond ( 1.88   ) .",
    "since c - atoms are more electronegative than si - atom the charge transfer from the si - atom toward the c - atoms can be relatively large leaving positively charged si ion behind .",
    "the divacancy has @xmath12 symmetry with six c dangling bonds .",
    "these dangling bonds form @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals while the si - related four @xmath53 states should form @xmath49 , @xmath51 , and @xmath50 orbitals in @xmath12 crystal field ( the explicit form of these orbitals as a function of @xmath53 states can be seen in ref .  ) .",
    "please , note that the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 states may be combined but @xmath52 orbitals should be pure c dangling bonds state ( see fig .  [",

    "the bonding and anti - bonding combinations of these states form the defect states of siv defect .",
    "( color online ) the defect - molecule diagram of the neutral siv defect in diamond .",
    "the irreducible representation of the orbitals under @xmath12 symmetry is shown .",
    "the orbitals of the si - atom and the six carbon dangling bonds of divacancy recombine in diamond where the conduction band ( cb ) and valence band ( vb ) are schematically depicted .",
    "the @xmath52 orbital is very close to the valence band maximum with forming a strong resonance state at the valence band edge shown as brown ( lighter gray ) lines .",
    "the @xmath51 level falls in the valence band that also forms a strong resonance even deeper in the valence band . for the sake of the simplicity , the position of the spin - up ( majority spin channel ) levels",
    "are depicted in the spin - polarized density functional theory calculation . ]    according to hse06 calculation the occupation of the defect states may be described as @xmath54@xmath55@xmath56@xmath57 which agrees again with previous lda calculations.@xcite here , the ten electrons are coming from the six electrons of c dangling bonds and the 4 @xmath53 electrons of the si impurity . as two electrons occupy the double degenerate @xmath52 state , the high - spin @xmath6 ground state naturally forms by following hund s rules .",
    "it is important to determine the position of the defect levels .",
    "interestingly , hse06 predicts that only @xmath52 appears in the band gap . in the spin - polarized calculation",
    "the occupied @xmath52 state in the spin - up channel is at @xmath37 + 0.3  ev .",
    "the @xmath51 state is resonant with the valence band and can be found just 0.64  ev below vbm .",
    "the occupied @xmath49 state lies very deep in the valence band and may play no important role in the excitation or ionization processes .",
    "our estimations indicate that the @xmath50 defect level is too deep in the vb to be excited by red excitation .",
    "however , higher energetic lasers ( in the green and blue spectrum ) can excite this state and other states within the vb with @xmath50 symmetry .",
    "the empty anti - bonding orbitals fall in the conduction band , and will not be considered any more . the most important @xmath51 and @xmath52 states",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] .        despite the @xmath51 state lies in the valence band it is still localized around the defect site .",
    "the valence band states are strongly perturbed by the presence of the defect .",
    "the vbm is triple degenerate in perfect lattice that splits to an upper @xmath49 level and a lower @xmath52 level in the presence of the defect .",
    "since this @xmath58 state has the same symmetry as the low - lying @xmath52 defect state , that @xmath58 state becomes a defect resonance state .",
    "similar phenomena occurs for the deep @xmath51 defect state as well",
    ". the shallow @xmath58 state may play an important role in the excitation / de - excitation process of the defect .",
    "we conclude that the neutral siv defect ( i ) has @xmath59 ground state , ( ii ) can be theoretically ionized as ( 2 + ) , ( 1 + ) , as well as ( 1- ) and ( 2- ) by emptying or filling the double degenerate @xmath52 state in the gap . in order to establish the relevant charge states",
    ", one has to calculate the adiabatic charge transition levels of siv defect .",
    "we found that the neutral , negatively charged and double negatively charged states can be found in diamond ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : occlev ] ) .",
    "the single positive charged state might be only found in very highly p - type doped diamond samples .     the calculated formation energy of siv defect as a function of the fermi - level in the gap .",
    "the crossing points represent the charge transition levels .",
    "the chemical potential of si is taken from cubic silicon carbide in the carbon - rich limit . ]    the calculated @xmath10 level at @xmath37 + 1.43  ev is very close to the level that is associated with the acceptor ionization energy of the defect from photo - conductivity measurements at @xmath3@xmath37 + 1.5  ev.@xcite interestingly , the calculated @xmath60 level at @xmath3@xmath37 + 2.14  ev is well below the midgap .",
    "since the @xmath52 level is fully occupied at @xmath37 + 1.5  ev in @xmath61 charge state intra - level optical transition can not take place , and ultra - violet excitation ( @xmath34.0  ev ) is needed to excite or ionize the defect optically to the conduction band edge .",
    "another important note that the calculated acceptor level of nv lies at @xmath3@xmath37 + 2.6  ev.@xcite this means that if both nv and siv defects are present in the diamond sample then most of the nv defects should be neutral in order to detect siv@xmath62 defect .",
    "another important point that the luminescence from siv@xmath62 defect can be more stable than that of nv@xmath62 defect in nanodiamonds as a function of surface termination because the corresponding @xmath60 charge transition level lies deeper in the band gap than the @xmath10 level of nv defect .",
    "all in all , the neutral and negatively charged siv defects are relevant for intra - level optical transitions .      in the negatively charge siv defect",
    "the ground state electron configuration is @xmath56@xmath63 .",
    "this is principally a jahn - teller unstable system as the double degenerate @xmath52 level is partially filled ( in the spin - down channel in our calculation ) .",
    "this has @xmath64 symmetry in @xmath12 symmetry . in hse06",
    "geometry optimization we allowed the systems to relax to lower symmetries .",
    "indeed , hse06 showed a @xmath65 distortion where two c - atoms have 0.03    longer distance from si - atom than the other two atoms . in this particular case",
    "@xmath66 state was formed in @xmath65 symmetry .",
    "however , we have to note that the dynamic coupling between vibrations and electronic states can not be taken into account in our calculation .",
    "thus , dynamic jahn - teller system can not be directly described by our method .",
    "for instance , static jahn - teller effect occurs for nv@xmath8 in ref .   while it is known from experiments that it is a dynamic jahn - teller system .",
    "since the distortion from @xmath12 symmetry obtained by hse06 calculation is small the defect may well have @xmath12 symmetry with dynamic jahn - teller effect .",
    "we note that no such an electron paramagnetic resonance center with @xmath67 spin was found that could be associated with siv - defect .",
    "this also hints that the ground state of siv@xmath4 is a dynamic jahn - teller system which prohibits the electron spin resonance signal similar to nv@xmath8 defect .",
    "now , we discuss the possible excited states of this system .",
    "again , the fully occupied @xmath51 state is resonant with the valence band .",
    "still , one can promote one electron from this level to the @xmath52 level in the band gap .",
    "the resulted @xmath68 excited state is again jahn - teller unstable .",
    "interestingly , when the electron from the minority spin - down @xmath51 level in the valence band was promoted to the @xmath52 state in the gap then the resulted hole state pops up clearly above the valence band edge at about @xmath37 + 0.12  ev [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sivexc](a ) ] . the @xmath69 optical transition is allowed . in hse06 calculation the excited state",
    "has also @xmath65 distortion but the effect is again small , and can be a dynamic jahn - teller system .",
    "the calculated zpl energy is about 1.72  ev which agrees well with that of 1.68-ev pl center .",
    "the calculated relaxation energy due to optical excitation is about 0.03  ev which is much smaller than that of nv center ( about 0.21  ev ) , and explains the small contribution of the vibration sideband in the emission spectrum .",
    "thus , the assignment of 1.68-ev pl center with siv@xmath62 defect is well - supported by our calculation .",
    "we argue that the sharp zero - phonon line of siv@xmath4 as well as the relative strength of the fine - structure splittings in the ground and excited states can be well - understood by our findings . the @xmath64 ground and @xmath68 excited states have very similar electron charge densities , where mostly just the phase differs between the two states . as a result",
    ", the ions will be subject to similar potentials in their ground and excited states leading to only small change in the geometry due to optical excitation .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case of nv@xmath4 defect where the electron charge density strongly redistributes upon optical excitation leading to a large stokes - shift.@xcite another observation is that @xmath64 state virtually is not localized at all on si - atom due to symmetry reasons , however , our projected density of states analysis shows that there is a small contribution from the orbitals of the si - atom in the @xmath68 excited state , allowed by symmetry .",
    "this may explain the larger splitting in the fine - structure of the excited state than that in the ground state:@xcite the @xmath68 state has expected to have larger spin - orbit splitting due to the small contribution of the orbitals of si - atom than that in @xmath64 state where this contribution is missing , as the spin - orbit strength increases with the atomic number to the fourth power .",

    "the electron configurations of @xmath84@xmath85 results in @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 multiplets . among these states @xmath89 and @xmath93 states are optically allowed from the @xmath86 ground state .",
    "polarization studies of the 1.31-ev center indicates that @xmath95 transition occurs in the pl process@xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 state can be described as linear combination of slater - determinants that can not be treated within constraint dft . however",
    ", the @xmath96=1 substate of @xmath93 multiplet can be described by a single slater - determinant .",
    "the calculated excitation energy is about 1.63  ev which is significantly larger than 1.31  ev .",
    "thus , we may conclude that @xmath97 transition is not responsible for the 1.31-ev pl line . as the only other feasible transition is @xmath95",
    ", our result indirectly confirms the experimental finding .",
    "we also study the role of the valence band resonant states similar to the case of the negatively charged defect .",
    "when the electron is promoted from @xmath72 state to the @xmath52 state in the gap then @xmath98 state is created .",
    "the calculated excitation energy of this shelving state is @xmath31.27  ev .",
    "this coincides with the small peak found in ref .  , simultaneously with the peak of 1.31-ev",
    "this transition is optically allowed only when the inversion symmetry of the defect is broken .",
    "this might happen due to strain in the diamond sample .",
    "nevertheless , our calculation implies that this @xmath98 state can play an important role in the de - excitation process as a shelving or metastable state .",
    "we note that the experiments indicate@xcite that the ground state of the neutral siv defect resides at @xmath30.2  ev above the valence band edge . according to hse06 calculations",
    "the occupied single particle @xmath52 level lies at @xmath37 + 0.3  ev that agrees nicely with the implications from the experiments .",
    "in addition , we found a metastable state of the defect which may explain the temperature dependence of the 1.31-ev pl spectrum@xcite .",
    "we also propose that strain may induce a weak pl transition from this shelving state because this shelving state has the same spin as that of the ground state , and the parity selection rule may be relaxed in slightly distorted geometry of the siv defect .",
    "we further note that a very similar conclusion can be drawn for the optical excitation of the neutral siv defect as was hinted for the negatively charged defect : a hole is created in the valence band in the excitation process that may leave defect temporarily or permanently which leads to a charge conversion from neutral to negatively charged siv defect .",
    "we carried out _ ab initio _ supercell calculations on siv defect in diamond .",
    "the calculations could positively confirm the assignment of 1.68-ev and 1.31-ev pl centers to the negatively charged and neutral siv defect , respectively .",
    "the calculations reveal the high importance of the inversion symmetry of the center as well as the role of resonant valence band states in understanding the optical properties of the defect .",
    "we show that the shelving states of 1.68-ev pl center are from valence band excitations where the lowest - energy shelving state may have nir emission to the ground state in strain diamond samples .",
    "we show that holes are created in the excitation of the negatively charged and neutral siv defects that may lead to charge conversion of these centers .",
    "in addition , we show that the acceptor level of siv defect lies very deep in the band gap . as a consequence , the 1.68-ev pl center can be photo - stable when it is close to the surface of hydrogenated diamond surface .",
    "on the other hand , siv defect is double negatively charged in such diamond samples where the nv - defect is negatively charged .",
    "thus , the fermi - level should be set lower than the midgap of diamond , in order to conserve its negative charge state .",
