    "this note is motivated by two types of problems concerning hypergraphs .",
    "the first is well - known and regards 2-colorable hypergraphs , also said to possess property b. several papers have presented bounds on @xmath1 , the minimum number of edges in a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph that does not have property b ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the second comes from ramsey theory , where appropriate properties of graphs containing a given graph with a fixed order can be used to prove negative partition relations for unordered graphs ( see @xcite and @xcite for early papers on this topic ) .",
    "we would like to determine the minimum number of edges in a oriented uniform hypergraph needed to ensure that for every ordering of the vertex set , some edge is ordered in the same way . here",

    "call @xmath9 an _ oriented @xmath0-uniform hypergraph _ , or , more briefly , an _ oriented @xmath0-graph_. in the case that @xmath10 contains an ordered @xmath0-set for each @xmath0-element subset of @xmath3 , call @xmath11 a _",
