    "the navier - stokes equations ( nse ) are derived for a continuum .",
    "therefore , many difficulties arise in dealing with any kind of discontinuity , including finite - size solution domains ( simply - connected or multiply - connected ) . particularly in an incompressible flow",
    ", the problem usually appears as non - solenoidal velocity fields .",
    "consequently , satisfying the mass conservation has been one of the most challenging issues of almost all algorithms of incompressible flow simulations , whether in the primitive variables formulations or the other formalisms .",
    "as it is revealed , the boundary conditions have a vital role here ; and therefore , appropriate definition of the boundary conditions received significant attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "+ the literature of the subject is too rich to completely be summarized in this paper ( see e.g. @xcite and the references in there ) ; however , as the most pertinent works , we shall make reference to the works of quartapelle and valz - gris @xcite , and also quartapelle @xcite , which studied the issue extensively .",
    "calhun @xcite used the immersed boundary technique in the vorticity  stream function formulation , and introduced an appropriate distribution of the vorticity in order to satisfy the overall mass balance . from another viewpoint ,",
    "the problem was studied in relation to the compatibility conditions ( also called the space  time corner singularity ) .",
    "the required compatibility conditions for the nse was studied by temam @xcite , gresho and sani @xcite , and also by boyd and flyer @xcite , and then by flyer and swarztrauber @xcite ) .",
    "+ the main contribution of the present paper is to suggest a method for construction of a _ nearly _ solenoidal velocity field , which satisfies _ approximately _ the desired _ immersed _ velocity boundary conditions , using the kinematic velocity  vorticity relation .",
    "the central idea is to use the well - known property that the divergence of the velocities , obtained from the velocity  vorticity equation is a harmonic function ; and therefore , gets its maximum values on the boundaries .",
    "consequently , the divergence can be reduced ( or even vanished ) all over the field , by restricting ( or vanishing ) the divergence near the boundaries . in the present method ,",
    "these restrictions are implemented by considering a zero - velocity margin in the vicinity of the outer regular boundaries .",
    "+ embedding non - regular solution domains in a bigger regular domain was shown to be useful in solution of the scalar poisson s problems @xcite .",
    "now the present work may be seen as an extension of the method to the vector poisson s problems that the solenoidal solutions are desired . as it will be shown , a solenoidal velocity field ( within the machine accuracy ) is achievable for the periodic boundary conditions ( that is , the no - boundary problems ) , and also improvements in the solenoidality is possible for the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the method can be used in recently popularized one - fluid @xcite , or one - continuum @xcite immersed boundary methods , as it was used successfully our previous work @xcite .",

    "+ with the above definitions in mind , the following procedure is suggested :     is extended to a bigger regular domain @xmath12 , where the extended vorticity @xmath17 is obtained and the poisson s equations are solved on . then the modified velocities @xmath18 are extracted from @xmath19 . ,",

    "more than the above arguments , our numerical experiments have also confirmed that in this case @xmath31 is solenoidal within the machine accuracy .",
