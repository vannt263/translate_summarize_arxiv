    "investigation on the nuclear structure of the trans - lead neutron deficient nuclei ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) have attracted much attention in recent years@xcite . for many of these nuclei , only the ground state spin and parity are known from their @xmath13-factor / magnetic moment measurements , and perhaps a few low lying excited states are observed so far .",
    "the major difficulties in populating the high spin states in these nuclei are : a ) very low cross sections for the formation of evaporation residues  ( er ) , and b ) very high probability of fission , which removes flux from the er channel and prevents the excited nucleus from sustaining large angular momenta needed to populate the high spin states .",
    "experimental investigation of the high spin states of quite a few trans - lead neutron deficient nuclei have been of interest recently .",
    "a series of investigations on the @xmath14fr isotopes@xcite showed that the structure can be interpreted in terms of the shell model states , and the excited states reveal an interplay between the protons in the @xmath15 states and the neutron holes in the @xmath16 orbitals , or the neutrons promoted to the @xmath17 high spin orbitals by core excitation , leading to the generation of high spin states .",
    "one of the major interests in the spectroscopic investigation of these nuclei is the role played by the @xmath18 shell in creating isomeric levels which decay through transitions of higher multipolarity or are hindered by the close proximity of the levels below .",
    "a few spectroscopic investigations on the proton rich lighter francium isotopes have been made recently .",
    "while a complete study of the @xmath19fr nuclei@xcite , using gammasphere and the hercules ii array for filtering out the evaporation residues from the fission background , revealed the existence of shears band in @xmath20fr  ( @xmath21 ) , investigations on the @xmath22fr nuclei@xcite have resulted in contradictory conclusions .",
    "spectroscopic studies made using the yrast ball array , comprising six compton suppressed clover hpge detectors@xcite , coupled to the sassyer recoil separator@xcite for selecting the evaporation residues had concluded that the pair of intense gamma rays of 632 kev ( ground state transition ) and 194 kev ( isomeric transition ) belong to @xmath23fr . the half life of the isomeric transition was measured to be 446(14 )  ns .",
    "at the same time , another independent study of isomeric decay of proton rich nuclei produced by projectile fragmentation reaction of @xmath24u beam at 900 mev / u on @xmath25be target at the fragment recoil separator ( frs ) facility of gsi , darmstadt , germany had assigned the same pair of gamma rays to @xmath7fr@xcite .",
    "clean isotopic and isobaric resolution of nuclei , which have low lying isomers with half lives @xmath26 100 ns , are routinely achieved using this facility@xcite .",
    "half life of the 194 kev isomeric transition was reported to be @xmath27  ns , though the prompt transitions above the isomer could not be observed because of experimental constraints .",
    "this paper reports investigation of the isomeric transitions in @xmath7fr , along with the high spin states above the isomers .",
    "it is noteworthy to report here that at the time of final phase of data analysis and preparation of the manuscript , a paper on assignments of levels in @xmath7fr was published by g. d. dracoulis et al.@xcite .",
    "the differences in our methods , the results of observations on the isomeric transitions , new @xmath6 transitions over and above those reported therein , and the basis for our assignments of the isomeric transitions to @xmath7fr are highlighted in this paper .",
    "the experiment to produce @xmath7fr was carried out at the inter - university accelerator centre ( iuac ) , new delhi .",
    "the fr isotopes were produced by bombarding a 3.5 mg.@xmath28 self - supporting gold ( 99.95% purity ) target with @xmath3o beam at 88 , 94 and 100 mev .",
    "the nuclei of interest were produced as evaporation residues ( er ) through ( @xmath3o ,  @xmath29 ) reactions .",
    "the target thickness was chosen on the basis of energy loss calculations based on srim2003@xcite to stop more than 90% of the er within the target , and allow most of the fission fragments to fly away from it .",
    "estimation of cross sections , angular distributions of the evaporation residues ( er ) and the fission yield were done using the code pace@xcite . based on these calculations ,",
    "@xmath30  % of the fusion products at these bombarding energies undergo fission , which causes a huge background .",
    "therefore , an effective filter to clean up the spectra , and / or good statistics are essential for extraction of meaningful results , as were done recently@xcite . in the absence of such filters ,",
    "use of large gamma detector arrays with high resolving power , good efficiencies for @xmath31 and @xmath32 coincidence events , along with additional measurements of excitation functions from in - beam and off - beam measurements yielding consistent results , have been utilized in our attempt to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "a few gated spectra of the fr isotopes . ]",
    "the @xmath6-rays produced were detected by the indian national gamma array ( inga ) consisting of 18 compton suppressed clover germanium detectors placed around the target@xcite at the inga - hyra beam line of the iuac , new delhi .",
    "four clover detectors were placed at @xmath33 , six at @xmath34 , four at @xmath35 , and four at @xmath36 for facilitating measurement of directional correlation from oriented states ( dco ) ratios .",
    "the linear signals , along with the anti - coincidence logic and the trigger signals , were processed through the indigenously developed clover electronics modules dedicated for the inga set - up@xcite . since the measurement of half lives of the isomeric states is crucial for the experiment , time to digital converters ( tdc )",
    "were used with stop signals from the individual clover units and common start signal from the master trigger which can be chosen to select 2-fold or higher fold events .",
    "range of the tdc was set to 400 ns for the exclusion of delayed @xmath6-rays possibly coming from @xmath37- and @xmath38 decays .",
    "altogether @xmath39 two - fold and @xmath40 three - fold coincidences were recorded in @xmath4150 hours at 100 mev beam energy , and @xmath41  20% of above numbers were obtained at 88 and 94 mev . in order to identify and measure the yield of the er nuclei from their known @xmath42 and @xmath43decay modes ,",
    "data were taken in the multiscaling mode during the beam - off condition between the runs .",
    "all the on - line and off - line data were collected using the camac - based candle data acquisition system@xcite , and were analysed off - line using candle , ingasort@xcite and radware@xcite analysis softwares .",
    "data analyses were done in several steps . for the excitation function measurements ,",
    "@xmath31 coincidence matrices were generated from the 2-fold data collected at the three different energies .",
    "yields for the intense @xmath6-rays , normalized by the current integrator readings recorded at the beam dump during the excitation function runs , were obtained from the francium @xmath44 and @xmath45 x - ray gated projections of the symmetrized matrices for each energy .",
    "the gated spectra are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , where the intense @xmath6-rays of @xmath7fr and @xmath23fr are indicated .",
    "the 724 kev @xmath6-ray is present in both the nuclei , and hence could not be resolved in the experiment .",
    "since its intensity is stronger in the decay of @xmath23fr levels , the excitation function shows the energy dependence typical of @xmath23fr .",
    "the trends of the excitation functions graphs for @xmath7fr and @xmath23fr , shown in the fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] are comparable to that predicted from the pace calculations , though it overestimates the @xmath7fr yield and underestimates the @xmath23fr yield at 100 mev . the @xmath46fr yield could not be measured even at the two lower energies as the corresponding characteristic @xmath6-rays are not known .",
    "the relative yields of the fr isotopes ( @xmath47 ) at the three different energies were also obtained from the radioactive decay runs taken in the beam - off condition .",
    "the time stamps in the list data blocks were used to generate the time marker . the @xmath48 vs. time matrices",
    "were generated using the candle analysis software from which , the @xmath48 spectra at different time windows were generated .",

    "the results show reasonably good agreement with the reference values quoted in the nndc database@xcite .",
    "relative yields of different ers at the beginning of beam - off runs , were extracted from the fitted @xmath52 values , measured half lives and the branching fractions of the different decay branches .",
    "the relative yields , obtained from our data for the fr isotopes , are shown in the table  [ tb1 ] . the major contribution to the uncertainties ( @xmath53 ) quoted in the relative yields",
    "is from the fluctuation in the beam current before the beginning of the beam - off runs , which were monitored during the analysis , and the rest from the exponential fit to the data .",
    "the results are in reasonable agreement with the measured excitation functions of fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] , which agrees with the assignment of the 826 kev isomeric level and the corresponding gamma transitions to @xmath7fr , rather than to @xmath23fr@xcite , in agreement with the conclusions of refs .",

    "while the probable cause of this difference was cited as due to the restricted tdc range @xmath56  ns in the previous work , our result does not seem to agree with this conclusion .",
    "we get results which are consistent with earlier measurements , though the uncertainties are larger in case of larger half lives ( eg .",
    "@xmath7rn@xcite ) . the restricted range of tdc would result in poor statistics for fitting data , with consequent larger error bars , as manifested in our results .",
    "the results of dco ratio measurements are enlisted in the table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "these measurements are pivoted on the _ e2 _ assignment of the 632 kev ground state transition , which follows from the systematics in the neighbouring nuclei , including francium isotopes .",

    "@xmath7rn@xcite ) in this mass region .    in the level scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] , the series of levels from 632 kev ( @xmath65 ) to 1983 kev ( @xmath66 ) along sequence i arise from the @xmath67 with proton excitations of higher seniority leading to the generation of angular momenta .",
    "this is clear from the connecting sequence of _",
    "e2 _ transitions .",
    "the maximum angular momentum generated from proton excitation in this case is @xmath68 , which leads to maximum @xmath69 for the given configuration .",
    "the 123 and 156 kev transitions above the 1983 kev level could be of _",
    "e2 _ nature , though our data is inadequate to make a definite conclusion .",
    "the sequence ii transitions , observed for the first time , are weak in intensity but they are fitted into the level scheme from the matched sequence of @xmath6-ray energies , coincidence conditions and intensities . however , the spin assignments of only the 2603 kev level could be done from the dco ratio for the 645 kev transition by gating on 563 kev _",
    "m1 _ transition .",
    "this could be a stretched _ e2 _ transition or a @xmath57 _ m1 _ transition , but the latter assignment was adopted to fix the spins of the level sequence .",
    "the 604 kev , 499 kev and 150 kev transitions appear to be _",
    "m1 _ though it can not be confirmed from our data .",
    "sequence iii transitions extend to the highest excitation energy of @xmath7fr in this experiment .",
    "it starts from the 1395 kev @xmath63 level which is connected by 569 kev _",
    "e2 _ transition to the 826 kev @xmath61 level .",
    "this sequence is likely to arise from the @xmath70 configuration which leads to the highest spin of @xmath71 , and are connected by a series of _ m1 _ transitions .",
    "though we could extend up to @xmath72 level , the absence of @xmath73 level is possibly because of the fact that it is pushed down by the residual proton particle neutron hole repulsive interaction , from where gamma transitions are hindered .",
    "a detailed shell model calculation will be needed to make a definite conclusion in this regard .",
    "the low lying transitions of the sequences v and vi , extending up to 2763 kev @xmath74 level can be formed by @xmath75 configuration through proton excitation .",
    "however , levels above @xmath73 along sequence vi , built on proton excitation to the maximum proton spin of @xmath76 , are due to neutron hole excitation arising from @xmath77 , leading up to the maximum @xmath78 level observed .",
    "the series of _",
    "e2 _ transitions above the 2262 kev @xmath79 level along the sequence v can be between levels generated by @xmath80 , which leads to a maximum @xmath81 . the levels above it are connected by _ m1 _ transitions which are probably generated by a different configuration .",
    "a better statistics and / or higher resolving power of the array will be needed to extend the level scheme further .",
    "the level scheme of @xmath7fr was modified over the existing level scheme , and extended up to @xmath82 and @xmath83 mev excitation energy using a high resolving power clover detector array .",
    "a number of new @xmath6-transitions were observed and their dco ratios were measured .",
    "based on search for isomeric transitions from the data using the tagged @xmath31 time difference technique , the half lives of several isomeric transitions in @xmath7fr and in a few neighbouring nuclei produced as er in the experiment were measured .",
    "the results agree reasonably well with the previously known half lives .",
    "the half life of the known 194 kev isomeric transition in @xmath7fr was found to differ from the previously reported value . a new isomeric _ e2 _",
    "transition was obtained and its half life was measured .",
    "the weisskopf estimate of the single particle strength of the associated isomeric levels reveal similarity with the previous estimates in the neighbouring nuclei . from the shell model based interpretation of the level scheme ,",
    "it is clear that the majority of the excited states are caused by @xmath84 proton excitations , and neutron hole excitations predominantly in @xmath85 and @xmath86 shells .",
    "the importance of @xmath86 neutron hole in generating the isomeric levels is clear from the present data .",
    "it may be noted that though we have observed only two isomer levels , there can be a few more such levels which could not be observed due to limted statistics in our data .",
    "a pulsed beam based experiment , coupled with such a high resolving power array will be needed to extend the study further .",
