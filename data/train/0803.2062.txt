    "in geometric group theory one attempts to elucidate the algebraic properties of a group by studying its actions on spaces with good geometric properties . for irreducible lattices in higher - rank semisimple lie groups , versions of margulis superrigidity place severe restrictions on the spaces that are useful for this purpose .",
    "our focus in this article is on the rigidity properties of the group @xmath7 of automorphisms of a free group , which is not a lattice but neverthless enjoys many similar properties .    in @xcite",
    "we exhibited strong constraints on homomorphisms from   and pointed out that such constraints restrict the way in which   can act on various spaces .",
    "we illustrated this point by showing that if @xmath0 then any action of   on the circle by homeomorphisms must factor through the determinant homomorphism @xmath8 .",
    "we now show that similar resrictions apply much more generally , to actions on higher - dimensional generalized homology spheres over @xmath9 and to generalized manifolds that are @xmath9-acyclic , for @xmath10 .    for @xmath11",

    "for linear actions , elementary results in the representation theory of finite groups can be combined with an understanding of the torsion in  to prove this statement ; the real challenge lies with non - linear actions .",
    "smooth actions are considerably easier to handle than topological ones . thus we begin by proving , in section [ s : smooth ] , that for @xmath14  can not act non - trivially by diffeomorphisms on a @xmath3-acyclic smooth manifold of dimension less than @xmath5 .",
    "the proof we present is deliberately constructed so as to point out the difficulties encountered in the purely topological setting .",
    "in particular , the proof requires understanding the fixed point sets of involutions .",
    "this immediately creates a problem in the topological setting because the fixed point sets of involutions are not in general manifolds , but only homology manifolds over @xmath3 .",
    "a second difficulty arises because there is no tangent space in the topological setting ; in the smooth case the tangent space allows one to use linear algebra to transport information about the action near fixed point sets to information about the action on the ambient manifold .",
