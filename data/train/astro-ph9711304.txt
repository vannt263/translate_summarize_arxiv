    "one of the outstanding problems in cosmology today is that of dark matter and its role in structure formation .",
    "dark matter is usually classified by its velocity dispersion at matter - radiation equality , when structure formation commences . at that time",
    ", cold dark matter has a negligible mean velocity , which preferentially leads to the collapse of small scale objects",
    ". hot dark matter on the other hand , has a very high mean velocity at matter - radiation equality , which means that the hot dark matter is able to free - stream out of the gravitational potentials .",
    "the typical hot dark matter candidate is a relatively light neutrino . for a neutrino with a mass @xmath1 ,",
    "the free - streaming length is @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom when the particle decouples from the plasma .",
    "neutrinos , for example , decouple when @xmath3=10.75 .",
    "this free - streaming of power to larger scales means that larger objects tend to form first , later fragmenting into smaller objects .",
    "these are the simplest models of structure formation . in both of these scenarios , after fixing the initial power spectrum and the classical cosmological parameters @xmath4 , the cosmological constant @xmath5 , the baryon density @xmath6 , and the hubble constant @xmath7 , the model is completely specified . typically , for example , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "it has long been recognized , however , that both of these models have serious difficulties .",
    "hot dark matter , for example , tends to form structures at very low redshifts ( @xmath13 ) whereas many galaxies and quasars are observed at redshifts up to @xmath14 of 4 .",
    "cold dark matter , on the other hand , has no difficulty forming galaxies , but tends to produce too much power on small scales and not enough on large scales .",
    "previous work on solving this problem has tended to focus on three solutions : mixed dark matter @xcite , a tilted power spectrum @xcite , and a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "mixed dark matter models include some hot dark matter to complement the cold dark matter .",
    "the free - streaming neutrinos can then disperse some of the small scale power to larger scales .",
    "the second approach is a tilt in the primordial power spectrum , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "this is a rather generic prediction of most inflationary models .",
    "since the inflationary potential is not constant during the inflationary epoch , the spectrum of fluctuations is not exactly scale invariant .",
    "this tilt in the power spectrum results in less power at small scales ( high @xmath17 ) . finally , there is the cosmological constant . for a fixed @xmath4 , adding a cosmological constant at the expense of the matter both decreases the matter density , and , through spatial repulsion , disperses power to larger scales .    in this article",
    ", we consider another solution to this problem , warm dark matter .",
    "warm dark matter is an alternative to mixed dark matter . rather than having two dark matter components , one hot and one cold ,",
    "warm dark matter is a single dark matter component with a mean velocity that is greater than that of cold dark matter but less than that of hot dark matter .",
    "one then hopes that warm dark matter is hot enough to reduce the small scale power of cdm but still cold enough not to lose all of the small scale power , as in the case of hdm .",
    "traditional extensions of the standard model of particle physics usually involve supersymmetry or massive neutrinos . both of these scenarios produce interesting dark matter candidates . depending on the scale of supersymmetry breaking , either gravitinos or neutralinos",
    "may be produced with cosmologically interesting abundances . at present , the two best warm dark matter candidates are gravitinos or right - handed neutrinos . here",
    "we consider the motivations for these particles .",
    "perhaps the most promising extension to the standard model is supersymmetry , which is a symmetry relating bosons ( integral spins ) to fermions ( half - integer spins ) . in supersymmetry",
    ", every known particle has a supersymmetric partner which differs in spin by @xmath18 . as an example",
    ", the photon ( spin 1 ) has a supersymmetric partner called the photino ( spin @xmath18 ) .",
    "supersymmetry has a number of features , perhaps the most appealing of which is that it stabilizes the low energy sector against radiative corrections that would otherwise drive the higgs mass up to the planck scale .",
    "it also seems to be an essential element for string theory , the leading candidate for a theory of everything .",
    "the fact that none of the supersymmetric partners have been observed means that supersymmetry must currently be broken . in the old days",
    ", it was thought that supersymmetry was broken at low energy scales . in this case",
    "the gravitino , which is the spin @xmath19 partner of the graviton ( spin 2 ) , has a mass @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the goldstino decay constant , which is the expectation value of the @xmath21 component of some hidden sector field responsible for breaking supersymmetry . since it is reasonable to expect that the threshold energies for the susy particles are comparable to the symmetry breaking scale @xmath21 , the gravitino is expected to be the lightest supersymmetric particle or lsp .",
    "pagels and primack proposed the @xmath22 helicity component of the spin @xmath19 gravitino as a dark matter candidate .",
    "this helicity component , which couples much more strongly to matter than the @xmath23 component @xcite , is able to remain in thermal equilibrium until about the electroweak phase transition , when it decouples and freezes out , leaving a relic abundance of gravitinos .",
    "low energy susy breaking is an idea that has received some renewed interest lately in the models of dine et .",
    "al @xcite and as a result of the cdf @xmath24 event @xcite ( although one event is hardly compelling , much less statistically significant ) . in these models , it is assumed that there is a hidden sector which consists of a new set of fields and interactions responsible for breaking supersymmetry . if these fields carry the quantum numbers of the standard model such as color , electric charge , etc .",
    ", they will couple to the supersymmetric particles through gauge loops .",
    "this is known as gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking . as was the case in the model of primack and pagels ,",
    "the gravitino is again the lsp with a mass @xmath25 it is interesting to note that in the context of gauge - mediated susy breaking , the interpretation of the cdf @xmath24 event requires @xmath26tev @xcite , which means that the gravitino mass @xmath27 should be less than about 250ev .",
    "since the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle , all other supersymmetric particles will decay into the gravitino in a cosmologically short time scale @xcite .",
    "this raises the rather interesting possibility of having two populations of gravitinos , one of which is produced by freezeout ( discussed below ) , and another which is produced non - thermally by sparticle decays @xcite .      in the standard model ,",
    "fermion dirac masses arise from terms in the lagrangian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the yukawa coupling of the higgs field @xmath30 to the fermion field @xmath31 , which has been decomposed into left ( @xmath32 ) and right ( @xmath33 ) handed components . when the higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath34 , @xmath35 , giving the fermion a mass @xmath36 .",
    "in the electroweak model , though , there are no right - handed neutrinos and so the neutrinos are massless .",
    "massive neutrinos have many advantages , however .",
    "they seem to be the best explanation for the solar neutrino puzzle , in which the observed boron neutrino flux is only about 1/3 of what is expected and the observed beryllium neutrino flux is only about 60% of what is expected .",
    "furthermore , models of structure formation in which some of the dark matter consists of neutrinos with a total mass of about 5ev do quite well when compared to the observational data @xcite .    although there are no right - handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory , right handed neutrinos are possible in extensions of the standard model . typically in such models ,",
    "the mass term in the lagrangian is @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass matrix of the neutrinos , @xmath39 is the dirac  mass \" of the standard model neutrino interaction eigenstates and @xmath40 is the  mass \" of the right - handed neutrino interaction eigenstates .",
    "note that because the physical states are a mixture of the interaction eigenstates , the masses of the physical states are not necessarily equal to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "actually , the physical masses are the eigenvalues of the mass matrix @xmath41 . in the case that @xmath42 , which occurs in many models , the physical neutrino masses are just @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is known as the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that the dirac mass terms @xmath39 are of the same order as the other low energy dirac mass terms , @xmath45gev ; then , if @xmath40 ( and therefore @xmath46 ) is large , @xmath47 , which explains why ordinary neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) are so light .",
    "since we have no idea what the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 might be , it is not hard to imagine that there might be a suitable combination of @xmath39 and @xmath40 which could give masses @xmath1 in the range of 1 - 10ev , just right for hot dark matter .",
    "another interesting consequence of massive neutrinos is that of oscillations . since the mass eigenstates are mixtures of the interaction eigenstates , it is possible for interactions to change one kind of neutrino into another , thereby explaining the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "in addition to dark matter , which consists of ev mass neutrinos , several authors have considered the idea of a population of heavier sterile neutrinos . using the seesaw model , dodelson and widrow @xcite considered the possibility that neutrino oscillations could produce a population of sterile neutrinos , but not at a rate fast enough for the sterile neutrinos to reach thermal equilibrium . in this scenario ,",
    "the left - handed neutrino masses are tiny : @xmath48ev , much too small to be cosmologically interesting .",
    "another possibility is the model of malaney , starkman , and widrow @xcite .",
    "typically when one considers right - handed neutrinos , it is assumed that all of the right - handed neutrino fields are very massive ( @xmath49gev ) .",
    "malaney et al . relaxed this assumption and supposed that one of the right handed neutrinos has a much lower mass ( @xmath50 200ev ) . in this model",
    "there are light neutrinos ( @xmath51ev ) and a heavier , sterile neutrino ( @xmath52ev ) , which is a mixed dark matter scenario .",
    "a supposed advantage of this model is that all of the dark matter can be placed in the neutrino sector ; the drawback is that one has to impose a rather unnatural hierarchy among the masses of the right - handed fields : @xmath53 .",
    "the dark matter distribution function can be written as reduces to the distribution function for hot dark matter ( such as a light neutrino ) when @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath31 describes cold dark matter . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the mass of the warm dark matter particle .",
    "the distribution function has three free parameters : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "fixing the warm - dark matter density gives one constraint : @xmath63 leaving two free parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 depends on the temperature @xmath65 of the dark matter particle when it decouples from the radiation field : @xmath66 where 10.75 is the number of degrees of freedom at ordinary neutrino - decoupling and @xmath3 is the number of degrees of freedom at wdm decoupling . in the standard model of particle physics",
    ", @xmath3 has the approximate temperature dependence @xcite @xmath67 let us consider some examples .",
    "pagels and primack @xcite assumed that @xmath68 , the threshold for the production of supersymmetric particles was of the order of the weak interaction scale , i.e. , @xmath69100 gev or larger . in that case , the gravitinos could remain in equilibrium down to temperatures @xmath70 , leading them to expect that @xmath71 . in the model of dodelson and widrow @xcite , for @xmath72ev , the right - handed neutrinos are produced at temperatures of 10 s of mev , and so @xmath73 .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 depends on how the warm dark matter particles are produced .",
    "particles that are simply thermal relics , and whose relic abundance just depends on when they freeze out , like hot dark matter , have @xmath55 . a particle which is produced out of thermal equilibrium , however , will typically have @xmath74 . in the model of dodelson and widrow , for example , the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix lead to @xmath74 .",
    "colombi et al .",
    "@xcite found that a warm dark matter particle with a mass @xmath60 and a temperature @xmath65 , which has a mass to temperature ratio @xmath75 , where @xmath76k , satisfies several observational tests in the linear regime .",
    "these tests included excess power on @xmath77 scales , bulk velocities on scales of @xmath78mpc , and normalization to the cobe data .",
    "on the other hand , non - linear simulations suggest that although wdm does a good job of reproducing the observed structure , it also produces too much small - scale power .",
    "wdm may also have trouble forming galaxies early enough . and recently , pierpaoli et al .",
    "@xcite found that warm dark matter models with light gravitinos ( 100ev @xmath79 1kev ) have problems producing the required hi abundances within high redshift damped ly-@xmath80 systems and sufficient abundances of local galaxy clusters .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that warm dark matter models consisting of sterile or right - handed neutrinos will have the same difficulties .",
    "here we propose another test of warm dark matter , one that combines large scale structure statistics and upcoming microwave background anisotropy experiments .",
    "since the two leading warm dark matter candidates are gravitinos and neutrinos , let us consider each of those in turn .",
    "if supersymmetry is broken at low energy scales , the gravitino is typically the lightest supersymmetric particle . in the model of pagels and primack @xcite , it was assumed that the threshold for susy particle production , above which the gravitino is in thermal equilibrium , was roughly of the order of the weak energy scale .",
    "this still seems reasonable in the context of gauge - mediated susy breaking theories . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is about 107 or 62 , depending on whether the gravitinos freeze out before or after the electroweak phase transition . using these assumptions",
    ", we can see that if the gravitino is to provide closure density , the value of @xmath27 will typically be less than about 250ev . since the gravitino mass is heavier than that of the hot dark matter ( @xmath81ev ) , but is much less than that of the typical cold dark matter ( @xmath82gev ) , these gravitinos behave like warm dark matter .",
    "first , consider the case in which all of the dark matter is in the form of warm gravitinos . in order to be viable dark matter candidates",
    ", the gravitinos should be able to reproduce the observed large scale structure properties . in linear theory ,",
    "two useful quantities are @xmath0 and the excess power @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the excess power compares the mass fluctuation on @xmath77mpc scales to that on @xmath84mpc scales , relative to that of standard cdm : @xmath85 observationally , @xmath86 , which means there is more power on @xmath77mpc scales than would be expected from a standard cold dark matter scenario . in table",
    "[ tab : lssg ] we list the values of @xmath0 and the excess power for the two gravitino models , one of which freezes out before the electroweak phase transition , when @xmath87 , and the other which freezes out after the electroweak phase transition , when @xmath88 .",
    "as is evident from this table , neither of these gravitino models does any better than scdm when compared to the large scale structure data .",
    ".large scale structure quantities for pure gravitino warm dark matter models .",

    "warm dark matter is interesting because it offers the possibility of solving the dark matter problem entirely in one new sector of the standard model .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest warm dark matter models do not appear to work : like scdm , they produce too much structure on small scales .",
    "an interesting resolution to this problem is offered by supersymmetry .",
    "if susy is broken at relatively low energy scales , it may be possible to have two populations of gravitinos ; phenomenologically , this would correspond to a mixture of warm and hot dark matter .",
