    "@xcite examined the stability of multiple planets in binary systems , including the effects of mutual planetary perturbations . in this case , interactions among the planets themselves appear to be the leading cause for instability .",

    "planets possessing a free eccentricity in addition to the forced value can reach higher overall eccentricity and will therefore be more unstable .    the second effect of the companion s strong secular forcing is to displace the centroid of different sub - resonances away from each other . in appendix [ section : a1 ] ,",
    "we derive expressions for the centroid and the width of a resonance when secular forcing is important .",
    "while the width remains unchanged from the non - secular case , the centroid of a mmr is shifted from its nominal position , ( @xmath59 ) , by an amount , @xmath60 . as a result",

    "in fact , we show that even the @xmath68 , and @xmath69 resonances do not affect the instability boundary much .",
    "moreover , while @xmath70 is the strongest sub - resonance in solar system dynamics ( in light of jupiter s small eccentricity ) , we find here that all sub - resonances are essential to determine the overlap region .",

    "a planet situated within a single resonance ( elsewhere spanned by additional resonances ) , but which is still outside of the region of overlap proper , may ( or may not ) librate into the latter .",

    "the two sets of results can be considered consistent since hw99 carried out their investigation over a crude grid in @xmath76 space . to confirm this",

    "the detailed topology agrees well with that obtained from our perturbation analysis , and in many cases , one can even identify the ( sub)-resonances responsible for the instability .",
    "this suggests that resonance overlap and the consequential chaotic diffusion is the mechanism responsible for the planet instability observed in hw99 s numerical investigation .",
    "moreover , there is little evidence for ` bounded chaos ' near the instability boundary , so that one can adopt the boundary of resonance overlap as the boundary for planet instability .    in an effort to delineate the differences between the chaotic dynamics existing within regions of resonance overlap and the regular dynamics existing just outside such regions , we numerically integrate two sets of two initially ` close ' planets .",
    "both sets of planets are situated near the 5:1 mmr in a binary system with mass ratio , @xmath79 , and eccentricity , @xmath80 .",

    ", both values agree with our experiments .    adopting the expression by @xcite",
    ", we obtain ejection times for various resonances .",
    "lower order resonances lead to faster ejection , while at the higher end , for example , the 30:1 resonance , we find @xmath97 for a system with mass - ratio , @xmath74 .",
    "this resonance ( corresponding to @xmath98 ) defines the maximum stable orbit for the most eccentric binary orbit we consider ( @xmath99 ) .",

    "a key question of interest asks , what is the longest - period stable planet orbit , for a given binary ( fixed @xmath105 and @xmath72 ) ?",
    "hw99 provided a fitting formula for the minimum unstable @xmath23 as a function of @xmath105 and @xmath72 .",
    "our results here indicate , however , that the minimum unstable @xmath23 should be reduced by up to @xmath2 from their values .",

    "adopting @xmath110 , and requiring resonance overlap ( @xmath111 ) , we find that instability occurs when @xmath112 defining @xmath113 , and relating @xmath27 to @xmath23 by kepler s law , @xmath114 , we recast equation ( [ eq : crit1 ] ) as @xmath115 where @xmath27 is also a function of @xmath23 .",

    "the first is that we are searching for the very minimum value of @xmath23 at each value of @xmath72 that allows resonance overlap . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_9 ] , this may lie up to @xmath0 below the hw99 numerical result .",

    "they are therefore not important for determining the instability boundary and we conclude that our neglect of @xmath126 mmrs is valid .",

    ", we argue that instability boundaries obtained from finite - duration numerical integration are reliable , even though they may not detect long - term instabilities brought about by very high - order resonances ( e.g. , 50:3 ) .",
    "a second point concerns the fact that we have ignored terms of order @xmath127 in the expansion of the disturbing function , and that our @xmath128 and @xmath129 coefficients are only correct to order - of - magnitude .",
    "we argue , however , that the instability boundary depends only on the ratio of @xmath130 ( eq .  [ [ eq : crit ] ] ) .",
    "moreover , if , for instance , the true ratio of @xmath130 is smaller by a factor of @xmath131 than our adopted value of @xmath118 , the instability boundary for @xmath75 is moved downward in @xmath23 by as much as @xmath132 ( fig .",

    "our arguments here are based on very crude scaling relationships .",
    "they ought to be checked using more elaborate numerical experiments .",
    "we focus on @xmath133 binaries to study the following two issues : the applicability of the hill criterion for predicting planet instability , and the relevance of ` bounded chaos ' that prevents us from using resonance overlap as a synonym for planet instability .    with the exception of those of first and second - order , the widths of all other mmrs approach zero in circular binaries ( see appendix [ section : a1 ] ) .",

    "moreover , our analysis suggests that overlap between very high - order resonances ( e.g. , 50:3 ) do not substantially modify the instability boundary : these weak resonances , while producing slow chaotic diffusion , which may be missed by finite - duration numerical integrations , do not contribute markedly to planet instability .    in detail ,",

    "the 5:1 mmr overlap gives rise to an ejection time @xmath152 binary orbits .",
    "compared with numerical integrations , our perturbation analysis has the following short - comings : the perturbation strength is calculated accurate only to first - order in the mass - ratio between the companion and the host star , and the perturbation formula diverges for @xmath153 .",
    "as a final note , we raise the issue of stability in circular binary systems ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "while the hill criterion ( critical jacobi constant ) gives the energetic condition for planet instability , resonance overlap provides the dynamical cause .",
    "we observe that over almost the entire range of mass - ratio , the hill criterion and resonance overlap yield similar critical @xmath23 values , making the hill criterion not only a necessary , but also a sufficient condition for planet instability .",

    "md99 have presented a derivation for the width of a mmr when the resonance angle evolves due to a single resonance . in our situation with a massive third body ,",
    "secular effects on the resonance angle have to be taken into account .",

    "the time - variations of @xmath155 , @xmath72 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 due to the influence of the planet are neglected as the planet can effectively be thought of as a test mass ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "we also neglect variations in @xmath20 as previously mentioned .",
    "we take the time - derivative of equation ( [ eq : podot ] ) , substitute equations ( [ eq : edot ] ) and ( [ eq : podot ] ) into the right - hand side , and use the resulting equations to recast equation ( [ eq : phiddot ] ) into the form @xmath159",

    "this reduces to equation ( 8.63 ) of md99 when @xmath161 and @xmath162 . in deriving this equation ,",
    "we have made some simplifying assumptions .",
    "firstly , we have ignored the time - dependence of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are in reality both functions of @xmath23 .",
    "secondly , we have neglected the @xmath163 terms in equations ( [ eq : edot ] ) and ( [ eq : podot ] ) as we expect their time - averaged contributions to be negligible .",
    "we look for a solution of the system that is pendulum - like , as in the case without secular forcing .",
    "following md99 , we write @xmath164/2 ] , where @xmath165 is the mean motion associated with the nominal value of the resonance and @xmath108 is a constant that describes the amplitude of the oscillation , or equivalently , the width of the resonance .",
    "the choice of the angular form , @xmath166 $ ] , is determined by the libration amplitude of the resonant angle @xmath24 ( @xmath167 to @xmath168 ) as well as the presumed angle where maximum change in the mean motion occurs ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the latter applies when @xmath170 and shifts to @xmath171 when @xmath172 ; however , the final result does not depend on the presumed sign of @xmath129 .",
    "the derivation that follows is analogous to that presented in  8.7 of md99 .",
    "we do not repeat the details here but simply outline the results : @xmath173 the secular term is important for shifting the centroid of the resonance , but does not contribute to the width of the resonance .",
    "in fact , the width formula is identical to equation ( 8.75 ) of md99 where secular forcing is ignored .",
    "the simple pendulum approach applies only when the resonant width is small , i.e. , @xmath174 .",
    "moreover , assuming that @xmath57 is driven by the secular interaction to a value that is proportional to @xmath72 ( eq .  [ [ eq : esec ] ] ) , most mmrs have widths which approach 0 as @xmath175 .",
    "the first - order ( e.g. , 2:1 ) and second - order ( e.g. , 3:1 ) resonances that satisfy @xmath176 are exceptions ; the width diverges for the former and approaches a constant for the latter ."
