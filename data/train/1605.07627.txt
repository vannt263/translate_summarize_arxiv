    "in quantum many - body systems , quantum phase transitions are among the most fascinating phenomena @xcite . from the point of the view of adiabatic continuity",
    ", a quantum phase transition can be characterized by the absence of an adiabatic path between ground states of quantum systems . consider two quantum many - body systems in their ground states .",
    "if an adiabatic path can be constructed to smoothly deform one system into the other without any singularity , these two quantum states can be classified into the same quantum phase . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is impossible to adiabatically deform one quantum system into the other , without going through some singular point ( or some intermediate phase ) , these two quantum states belong to different quantum phases of matter and the singular point , which arises when we try to deform one system into the other , is a quantum phase transition point .",
    "in general , quantum phase transitions can be largely classified into two categories , landau - type and topological , depending on the origin of the singularity . in the first category ,",
    "the two quantum phases separated by a quantum phase transition have different symmetries , i.e. certain symmetry is broken spontaneously as we move across the phase boundary .",
    "similar to a classical ( thermal ) phase transition , the difference in symmetry implies that it is impossible for these two quantum states to smoothly evolve into each other without undergoing a quantum phase transition . in the second category",
    ", the two quantum phases have the same symmetry , but their ground - state wavefunctions have different topological structures . for a gapped quantum system , where a finite energy gap exists between the ground state and the excited ones , the topology of the ground state wavefunction can not change in any adiabatic procedure without closing the excitation gap . thus ,",
    "if the ground state wavefunctions of two gapped quantum systems have different topology , as we try to deform one into the other , a singularity point must arise , at which the energy gap closes and the ground - state wavefunction changes its topology .",
    "this singular point is known as a topological phase transition .",
    "such a topological transition can take place even in the absence of interactions , e.g. in non - interacting band insulators  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study adiabatic continuity between quantum states in gapped quantum systems focusing on the following question : _ for two ( arbitrary ) quantum states , how can we determine whether a gapped adiabatic path between these two states exists or not _ ?",
    "more precisely , we want to determine , for two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whether it is possible or not to construct a gapped hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some control parameter , such that as we tune the value of the control parameter @xmath3 , the ground state of the hamiltonian changes smoothly from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . it must be emphasized that here we require that the hamiltonian remains gapped for this adiabatic procedure , i.e. , the energy gap between the ground and excited states never vanishes . as discussed above ,",
    "the answer to this question is of direct relevance to the study of quantum phase transitions between gapped quantum systems , including topological phase transitions .    for band - insulators",
    ", we find that regardless of the symmetry and microscopic details , as long as the bloch wavefunctions ( of the valence bands ) of two insulators have finite wavefunction overlap , an adiabatic path can be constructed , connecting the two insulators without closing the insulating gap . for the study of topological band insulators",
    ", this conclusion implies that two band insulators with finite wavefunction overlap must have the same topology , i.e , all topological indices take the same value in the two insulators .",
    "this result also implies that for two insulators with different topology , there must exist at least one momentum point in the brillouin zone , at which the bloch waves in these two insulators are orthogonal to each other , i.e. the wavefunctions have zero overlap .",
    "this conclusion can be easily generalized to interacting systems , i.e. , if two quantum states have finite wavefunction overlap , regardless of microscopic details , a gapped adiabatic path can be defined to connect these two states . however , as pointed out below , this conclusion can not be applied to study generic quantum many - body systems and quantum phase transitions , due to the orthogonality catastrophe  @xcite , which says that in the thermodynamic limit , even for two quantum states in the same quantum phase , the wavefunction overlap will vanish due to the infinite size of the system . as a result , the wavefunction overlap , which is always zero in the thermodynamic limit , does nt carry useful information about quantum phases and adiabatic continuity .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to noninteracting systems , e.g. band insulators , where we can utilize single - particle bloch waves , which do not suffer from the orthogonality catastrophe . in this article",
    ", we show that the problem caused by the orthogonality catastrophe can be resolved in certain interacting systems , including integer and fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite , and integer and fractional chern insulators  @xcite , utilizing various schemes , e.g. , by studying systems with finite size or factorizing the many - body wavefunction .",
    "in this article , we study adiabatic continuity in band insulators in sec .  [",
    "sec : band_insulator ] .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec : interacting ] , we generalize the conclusion to interacting systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction_phase_transition ] , we discuss how to utilize this result to study quantum phase transitions in the presence of interactions .",
    "two examples , will be discussed .",
    "finally , we conclude the article by discussing possible implications in experimental and numerical studies .",
    "details about the calculations and proofs are shown in appendix .",
    "for band insulators , if we only focus on the qualitative properties , interactions can often be ignored . within the non - interacting approximation ,",
    "the quantum wavefunction of a band insulator is the ( anti - symmetrized ) product of bloch - wave states .",
    "because of the lattice translational symmetry , bloch states with different crystal momenta decouple from one another",
    ". therefore , we can examine wavefunction overlap at each momentum point separately .",
    "in this section , we focus on the non - interacting regime .",
    "first , we prove that for two band insulators , the wavefunction overlap between the many - body ground states factorizes into the product of ( bloch - wavefunction ) overlaps at each momentum point .",
    "then , we will show that if the overlap remains finite for all momenta , the two insulators are adiabatically connected , i.e. we can adiabatically deform the wavefunction of one insulator into the other without closing the insulating gap or breaking any symmetries .",
    "this conclusion immediately implies that ( a ) if two band insulators belong to two different quantum phases ( i.e. it is impossible to deform one state into the other without closing the insulating gap ) , there must exist ( at least ) one momentum point @xmath4 , at which the ( bloch - wavefunction ) overlap between the two insulators vanishes , and ( b ) if the bloch wavefunctions of two band insulators have finite overlap at all momenta , these two insulators must belong to the same quantum phase .",
    "we start the discussion by considering insulators with only one valence band ( sec .  [",
    "sec : one - band ] ) . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi_bands ] , we will generalize the conclusions to generic cases with multiple valence bands .",

    "it is easy to prove that as long as the overlap is nonzero @xmath29 , @xmath26 is positive and thus the denominator will not introduce any singularity .    when @xmath30 , the bloch state defined above coincides with @xmath21 , i.e. the bloch state for insulator @xmath5 . at @xmath31 ,",
    "the bloch state becomes that of insulator @xmath6 , up to an unimportant phase factor , @xmath32 therefore , by varying the parameter @xmath33 , eq .",
    "defines a path between the two insulators .",
    "as proved in appendix  [ sec : symmetry ] , if insulators @xmath5 and @xmath6 preserve certain symmetries ( e.g. , the time - reversal symmetry , lattice symmetries or some internal symmetries ) , the bloch state @xmath34 will preserve the same symmetry .",

    ", there must be at least one momentum point , at which the overlap vanishes .      in eq .",
    ", we introduced a factor @xmath43 in the definition of @xmath34 .",
    "this factor is necessary in order to preserve the @xmath42 phase symmetry , which is also known as the @xmath42 gauge symmetry for band insulators  @xcite . in a band insulator",

    "[ sec : band_insulator ] .",
    "however , for certain interacting systems , such a factorization could happen , which offers us another way to avoid the orthogonality catastrophe in the study of wavefunction overlap .",
    "here we consider a ( aa - stacked ) bilayer kane - mele model as studied in ref .  .",
    "for each layer , we have a non - interacting kane - mele model ( on a honeycomb lattice ) , which describes a @xmath164 topological insulator . between the layers , an interlayer anti - ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction is introduced between interlayer nearest neighbors .    in this model , because the @xmath165-component of the spin is conserved , the insulating ground state is characterized by an integer - valued topological index , known as the spin chern number . in the non - interacting limit ,",
    "the topological index is @xmath166 , i.e. , the system is topologically nontrivial . because there is no interaction , the ground state factorizes as the anti - symmetrized product of bloch states @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the creation operators for the two valence bands in the top layer . here",

    "in this article , we explored the relation between wavefunction overlap and adiabatic continuity in ( non - interacting ) band insulators and interacting quantum systems .",
    "our results can be utilized to simplify certain problems in the study of topological states .",
    "for example , in the study of band insulators , a large number of topological indices have been introduced ( e.g. the chern number , the z@xmath188 topological index , the mirror chern number , the spin chern number , the hopf index ) , and more topological indices can be defined , if we enforce additional symmetries ( e.g. space - group symmetries ) . as a result , to fully determine the topological property of an insulator becomes a nontrivial task . in principle , it is necessary to compute _ all _ these topological indices in order to achieve such an objective .",
    "the conclusions reported in this article offer an alternative approach . instead of trying to compute all known topological indices , one can utilize some known insulators as reference states , whose wavefunctions and topological properties are well understood . if the bloch waves of a new insulator have nonzero overlap with some reference insulator , we immediately know the topological properties of this new insulator , which must be identical to the reference insulator . if the new insulator has zero bloch - wavefunction overlap with all known reference insulators , then this insulator might be a new topological state , and it requires further investigation to understand its topological structure .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that a nonzero wavefunction overlap is a sufficient condition for topologically equivalence , but it is not necessary .",
    "for example , two topologically equivalent states may accidentally have wavefunctions that are orthogonal to each other .",
    "such an accidental vanishing wavefunction overlap is typically not stable and will be removed by small perturbations , while the topologically - protected zero wavefunction overlap is stable and can not be removed .    for interacting systems , our theorem can be easily generalized .",
    "however , it can not be applied to generic interacting systems because of the orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "on the other hand , in the study of interacting topological states , many numerical methods can only handle finite - size systems ( e.g. exact diagonalization or density matrix renormalization group ) .",
    "there , our conclusions will not suffer from the orthogonality catastrophe , and thus could benefit some of the numerical investigations .",
    "above , we proved that if we have two insulators with different topology , there must exist ( at least ) one momentum point , at which the overlap of the wavefunction vanishes .",

    "<S> in this article , we study the relation between wavefunction overlap and adiabatic continuity in gapped quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for two band insulators , a scalar function can be defined in the momentum space , which characterizes the wavefunction overlap between bloch states in the two insulators . </S>",
    "<S> if this overlap is nonzero for all momentum points in the brillouin zone , these two insulators are adiabatically connected , i.e. we can deform one insulator into the other smoothly without closing the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we further prove that this adiabatic path preserves all the symmetries of the insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such an adiabatic path implies that two insulators with nonzero wavefunction overlap belong to the same topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> this relation , between adiabatic continuity and wavefunction overlap , can be further generalized to correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized relation can not be applied to study generic many - body systems in the thermodynamic limit , because of the orthogonality catastrophe . however , for certain interacting systems ( e.g. quantum hall systems ) , the quantum wavefunction overlap can be utilized to distinguish different quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> experimental implications are also discussed . </S>"
