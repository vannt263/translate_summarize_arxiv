    "however , the contraction along the @xmath14 axis is much more pronounced , especially in the nonmagnetic state .",
    "this indicates that the distance between the neighboring feas and ba layers is substantially reduced by pressure .",
    "this can strengthen the coupling between the neighboring feas layers and stabilize the long range antiferromagnetic correlation in the feas layer .",
    "the magnetic moment in the magnetic states decreases almost linearly with pressure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vc - e - m](b ) . in our calculations ,",
    "the magnetic moment is always larger than 2@xmath74 in the collinear antiferromagntic state .",
    "the superexchange interaction thus remains dominant when a pressure is imposed .",
    "physically the moments of fe ions result from the on - site coulomb repulsion and the hund s rule coupling of @xmath12 orbitals . an isolated fe ion in a 2 + valency",
    "has a spin @xmath75 with a large magnetic moment of @xmath76 . in iron - pnictide semimetals , the effective moment of a fe ion ( in a 2 + valency ) will be reduced by its hybridization with other atoms and by the coulomb screening of itinerant electrons .",
    "however , it will remain finite if the hund s rule coupling and the on - site coulomb repulsion is strong enough in comparison with the hybridization and other screening effects , as we found in lafeaso @xcite .    in our calculations , by projecting the density of states onto the five @xmath12 orbitals of fe in the collinear antiferromagnetic state of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ figb](c ) ) , we find that the five @xmath12 orbitals of fe are almost completely filled by up - spin electrons and nearly half - filled by down - spin electrons in one of the two sublattices ( or completely filled by down - spin electrons and half - filled by up - spin electrons in the other sublattice ) .",
    "this indicates that the crystal field splitting imposed by as atoms is very small and the fe @xmath12-orbitals hybridize strongly with each other .",
    "we can see that this is a universal feature for all iron pnictides , as we first found in lafeaso @xcite .",
    "the strong polarization of fe magnetic moments is thus due to the hund s rule coupling .    in low temperatures ,",
    "the fe moments will interact with each other to form an antiferromagnetic ordered state .",
    "these ordered magnetic moments have been observed by elastic neutron scattering and other experiments @xcite .",
    "however , they are not exactly the moments obtained by the dft calculations , as we indicated first for lafeaso @xcite .",
    "this is because the dft calculation is done based on a small magnetic unit cell and the low - energy quantum spin fluctuations as well as their interactions with itinerant electrons are frozen by the finite excitation gap due to the finite - size effect .",
    "thus the moment obtained by the dft is the bare moment of each fe ion .",
    "it should be larger than the ordering moment measured by neutron scattering and other experiments .",
    "our calculations show that the bare magnetic moment around each fe atom is about @xmath77 in all iron pnictides and in different magnetically ordered states .    in high temperatures",
    ", there is no net static moment in the paramagnetic phase due to the thermal fluctuation , but the bare moment of each fe ion can still be measured by a fast local probe like esr ( electron spin resonance ) . very recently , the bare moment of fe has been observed in the paramagnetic phase by the esr measurement @xcite .",
    "the value of the moment detected by esr is about @xmath78 in good agreement with our dft result , which is but significantly larger than the ordering moment in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "again similar to what we found in lafeaso@xcite , from the spatial distributions of electrons , we further find that there is a strong hybridization between neighboring fe and as ions .",
    "this strong hybridization can mediate an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the fe moments .",
    "this superexchange interaction is antiferromangtic since the intermediated state associated with the hopping bridged by as ions is a spin singlet . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a relatively small but finite hybridization between two neighboring fe ions .",
    "this direct hybridization of fe @xmath12 orbitals can induce a direct exchange interaction between the fe moments .",
    "this direct exchange interaction is ferromagnetic due to the hund s rule coupling .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong covalent bonding or hybridization between as @xmath1 orbitals although the separation between as atoms is relatively large .",
    "this hybridization gives rise to a broad as @xmath1 band below the fermi level .",
    "thus as @xmath1 states are not truly localized .",
    "they form an electron network connecting as ions through covalent bonding , similar to what we found in iron chalcogenides ( @xmath79-fese and @xmath79-fete)@xcite .",
    "however , there is difference that the band formed by as @xmath1-orbitals is insulating , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figa ] , while the band formed by te @xmath80-orbitals is metallic ( see ref . ) .",
    "it turns out that the exchange interaction bridged by as @xmath1 orbitals is short ranged ( just @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) while the one bridged by te @xmath80 orbitals can be long ranged , as we found in @xmath79-fete in which there is a substantial third nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction @xmath81 besides @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .      for iron - based pnictides ,",
    "the low energy spin dynamics could be approximately described by an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with the nearest and the next - nearest neighbor exchange interactions .",
    "however , the fe spin ( or magnetic moment ) is not quantized since the electrons constituting the moment can propagate on the lattice , like in hole or electron doped high @xmath82 superconductivity cuprates .",
    "besides these superexchange interactions , the on - site hund s rule coupling among different fe @xmath12 orbitals is important .",
    "this is because the crystal splitting of fe @xmath12 levels is very small and the spins of fe @xmath12 electrons are polarized mainly by this interaction .",
    "thus we believe that the low - energy physical properties of these iron - based pnictides can be approximately described by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the summation over the nearest and the next - nearest neighbors , respectively . @xmath79 and @xmath86 are the indices of fe @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "@xmath87 is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "@xmath88 is the spin operator of the @xmath79 orbital at site @xmath89 .",
    "the total spin operator at site @xmath89 is defined by @xmath90 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath91 is the on - site hund s coupling among the five fe @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "the value of @xmath91 is generally believed to be about 1 ev .",
    "@xmath92 are the effective hopping integrals that can be determined from the electronic band structure in the nonmagnetic state@xcite .",
    "the nearest and the next - nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling constants , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) can be calculated from the relative energies of the ferromagnetic , square antiferromagnetic , and collinear antiferromagnetic states with respect to the non - magnetic state . for the corresponding detailed calculations ,",
    "please refer to the appendix in our paper in ref . .",
    "for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the energy of the ferromagnetic state is about 8mev per fe lower than the nonmagnetic state and the fe moment is about 2.3@xmath74 . from this and the relative energies of the two antiferromagnetic states",
    ", we find that the exchange constants are approximately given by @xmath37= 25.5 mev/@xmath39 per fe and @xmath38 = 33.8 mev/@xmath39 per fe ( @xmath93 is the spin of the fe ion ) for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , we also find that the interlayer superexchange antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath42 = 3.1 mev/@xmath39 per fe . in obtaining these values",
    ", we have assumed that the contribution of itinerant electrons to the energy is almost unchanged in different magnetically ordered states .",
    "since the bare @xmath92 and @xmath91 can be considering independent of magnetic structures , the relative energies between different magnetic states are not affected by itinerant electrons . for srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath42 are determined as well and given in table [ tableall ] .",
    "as we notice , @xmath37 in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is negative , namely ferromagnetic , which is unique among iron pnictides .",
    "we plot the superconducting critical temperatures @xmath82 versus @xmath38 for these compounds with doping carriers or by applying high pressures in fig .",
    "[ tc - j2 ] .",
    "interesting , as we see , the maximum critical temperatures @xmath82 are in proportion to the next - nearest neighbor superexchange interaction @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that there would exist an intrinsic relationship between the superconductivity and the as - bridged superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "here we have assumed that the value of @xmath38 does not change with doping or pressure in comparison with the ones of the parent compounds .",
    "this can be verified from fig .",
    "[ vc - j1-j2 ] .",
    "[ vc - j1-j2 ] shows how the superexchange interactions @xmath37 and @xmath38 change with the pressure , from which we find that @xmath38 slightly changes with the pressure .",
    "however , @xmath37 drops quickly with increasing pressure .",
    "this is because the energy difference between the non - magnetic state and the square antiferromagnetic neel state can be significantly reduced by the pressure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vc - e - m ] .     versus exchange interaction @xmath38 for afe@xmath0as@xmath0 (",

    ", width=283,height=188 ]    in comparison with the bare @xmath92 and @xmath91 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are very small .",
    "when we study charge dynamics like charge transport happening in iron pnictides , @xmath92-@xmath91 part will thus play a dominant role . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , if the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms are ignore , the hamiltonian will look similar to the double exchange model that was proposed for describing physical properties of colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) of manganese oxides@xcite .",
    "however , there is an essential difference . in manganese oxides the crystal field splitting between @xmath94 and @xmath95 orbitals is very large , the moments polarized by the hund s rule coupling on the @xmath95 orbitals are completely localized and only @xmath94 electrons can hop on the lattice .",
    "in contrast , in iron pnictides , all five @xmath12 orbitals of fe have contributions to the moment and at the same time they can also hop on the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that their charge dynamics shares a common feature . in manganese oxides there is a strong spin - dependent scattering on the conduction electrons due to the strong hund s coupling between @xmath94 and @xmath95 levels of mn ions .",
    "if the localized core spins of mn are aligned ferromagnetically , the scattering of the electrons due to the core spins will be dramatically reduced because of no spin - flip , leading to a giant magneto - resistance and a sharp drop of resistivity with decreasing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase . in iron pnictides",
    ", there is also a strong spin - dependent scattering on conduction electrons caused by the hund s rule coupling . in low temperatures , the moments of fe ions are in the collinear antiferromagnetic order , in which the fe moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along one direction but ferromagnetically along the other direction perpendicular .",
    "similar as in manganese oxides , the scattering of electrons along the ferromagnetic direction is significantly reduced , leading to a sharp drop of resistivity and a large magneto - resistivity in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase , in agreement with experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have reported calculated results on the electronic band structures of afe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( a = ba , ca , or sr ) by using the first - principles electronic structure calculations . the ground state of afe@xmath0as@xmath0 is shown to be a collinear antiferromagnetic semimetal with a large magnetic moment around each fe ion .",
    "the electronic structure is weakly affected by the spin - orbit interaction , but strongly altered by pressure .",
    "we have determined the density of states at the fermi level , the specific heat coefficient and the pauli susceptibility in both the non - magnetic and collinear antiferromagnetic states .",
    "the effective antiferromagnetic coupling constants of the fe moments are also estimated assuming that the low - energy spin dynamics is approximately described by the heisenberg model with the nearest and the next - nearest neighboring exchange terms .",
    "based on the analysis of electronic and magnetic structures , we proposed that the low - energy physics of afe@xmath0as@xmath0 can be effectively described by the @xmath2 model , defined by eq .",
