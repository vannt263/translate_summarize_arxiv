    "a physical system is in a _",
    "metastable state _ when it remains locked for a very long time in a phase that is different from the one corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the latter is referred to as the _ stable state_. classical examples are supersaturated vapours , supercooled liquids , and ferromagnets in the hysteresis loop .",
    "the main three objects of interest for metastability are the transition time from the metastable state to the stable state , the gate of configurations the system has to cross in order to achieve the transition , and the tube of typical trajectories the system follows prior to and after the transition .",
    "metastability for interacting particle systems on _ lattices _ has been studied intensively in the past three decades .",
    "various different approaches have been proposed .",
    "after initial work by cassandro , galves , olivieri and vares  @xcite , neves and schonmann  @xcite , @xcite , a powerful method  known as the _ pathwise approach _ to metastability based on large deviation theory  was developed in olivieri and scoppola  @xcite , @xcite , catoni and cerf  @xcite , manzo , nardi , olivieri and scoppola  @xcite , cirillo and nardi  @xcite , cirillo , nardi and sohier  @xcite .",
    "this was successfully applied to low - temperature ising and blume - capel models subject to glauber spin - flip dynamics ( in two and three dimensions , with isotropic , anisotropic and staggered interactions ) in koteck and olivieri  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , cirillo and olivieri  @xcite , ben arous and cerf  @xcite , nardi and olivieri  @xcite .",
    "later , another powerful method  known as the _ potential - theoretic approach _ to metastability based on the analogy between markov processes and electric networks  was developed in bovier , eckhoff , gayrard and klein  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this was shown in bovier and manzo  @xcite , bovier , den hollander and spitoni  @xcite to lead to a considerable sharpening of earlier results .",
    "for other approaches to metastability , as well as further examples of metastable stochastic dynamics and relevant literature , we refer the reader to the monographs by olivieri and vares  @xcite , bovier and den hollander  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the ising model on _ random graphs _ ( dembo and montanari  @xcite , dommers , giardin and van der hofstad  @xcite , mossel and sly  @xcite ) .",
    "the only results known to date about metastability subject to glauber spin - flip dynamics are valid for @xmath0-regular random graphs ( dommers  @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we investigate what can be said for more general degree distributions .",
    "metastability is much more challenging on random graphs than on lattices .",
    "moreover , we need to capture the metastable behaviour for a _ generic realisation _ of the random graph .    in section  [ isingglauber ]",
    "we define the ising model on a random multigraph subject to glauber spin - flip dynamics .",
    "we start from the configuration where all spins point down , and allow spins to flip up or down according to a metropolis dynamics at positive temperature .",
    "we are interested in the time it takes the system to reach the configuration where all spins point up . in section  [ metastability ]",
    "we introduce certain geometric quantities that play a central role in the description of the metastable behaviour of the system , and state three general theorems that are valid under a certain key hypothesis .",
    "these theorems concern the average transition time , the distribution of the transition time , and the gate of saddle point configurations for the crossover , all in the limit of low temperature .",
    "they involve certain key quantities associated with the random graph .",
    "our goal is to study the scaling behaviour of these quantities as the size of the graph tends to infinity .    in section  [ literature ]",
    "we describe four examples to which the three general theorems apply : three refer to regular lattices , while one refers to the erds - rnyi random graph . in section  [ configurationmodel ]",
    "we recall the definition of the configuration model , which is an example of a random graph with a non - trivial geometric structure . in section  [ maintheorems ]",
    "we state our main metastability results for the latter . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we place these results in their proper context and give an outline of the remainder of the paper .      given a finite connected non - oriented multigraph @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be the set of configurations @xmath3 that assign to each vertex @xmath4 a spin - value @xmath5 .",

    "we write @xmath17 if and only if @xmath18 and @xmath19 agree at all but one vertex .",
    "a transition from @xmath18 to @xmath19 corresponds to a flip of a single spin , and is referred to as an _ allowed move_. glauber spin - flip dynamics on @xmath20 is the continuous - time markov process @xmath21 defined by the transition rates @xmath22_+ } , & \\xi\\sim\\zeta,\\\\ 0 , & \\mbox{otherwise}. \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the gibbs measure in is the reversible equilibrium of this dynamics .",

    "<S> , the system needs to create a sufficiently large droplet of up - spins , called critical droplet , which triggers the crossover .    in the limit as the temperature tends to zero , and subject to a certain _ key hypothesis _ implying metastable behaviour , the average crossover time follows the classical _ arrhenius law _ </S>",
    "<S> , with an exponent and a prefactor that are controlled by the _ energy _ and the _ entropy _ of the critical droplet . the crossover time divided by its average is exponentially distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we study the scaling behaviour of the exponent as the number of vertices tends to infinity , deriving upper and lower bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify a regime for the magnetic field and the pair potential in which the key hypothesis is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the critical droplets , representing the saddle points for the crossover , have a size that is of the order of the number of vertices . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the random graphs generated by the configuration model are expander graphs . </S>"
