    "there are three promising theoretical models to explain the formation of the massive stars : monolithic collapse , competitive accretion , and mergers of low mass stars ( see for a review , zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) .",
    "however , their relative large distances ( a few parsecs ) , the clustered formation environments , and their short timescales have made extremely difficult to discard any of these models ( zapata et al .",

    "massive stars have a substantial impact on their surrounding environments , making important contributions to the chemistry enrichment of the interstellar medium ( e.  g. , hernndez - hernndez et al .",

    "uranus was used for flux calibration , and the absolute flux scale is estimated to be accurate to within 20% .",

    "self - calibration was performed to the continuum data , and the gain solutions from the continuum were applied to the line data .",

    "1 @xmath9 rms noises of the continuum and lines are approximately 0.01 jy beam@xmath10 and 0.1 jy beam@xmath10 , respectively . 1",
    "jy beam@xmath10 corresponds to a main beam brightness temperature of 2.7 k.",
    "continuum image was constructed from line - free channels of lsb and usb uv data , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the continuum image shows a compact and strong source at the position of w51 north , with an extension to the north , which embraces irs2d source .",
    "kjd3 and w51d2 are located east and west of w51 north , respectively ( zapata et al . 2008 ) .",
    "two dimension gaussian fits were made to the continuum obtaining the peak intensity and total integrated flux of @xmath11 jy  beam@xmath10 and @xmath12 jy , respectively .    under the assumptions that an average grain radius is 0.1 @xmath13 m , grain density is 3 gr @xmath14 and a gas to dust radio is 100 , the h@xmath1 column density and mass can be calculated by the formula ( lis , carlstrom & keene 1991 ) ,    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are boltzmann constant and planck constant , respectively .",

    "probably the dust and gas are well coupled through collisions in w51 north region .",
    "so we assumed that the dust temperature equals the rotation temperature of 138 k derived from the ch@xmath0oh lines .",
    "we adopt @xmath22 at 1.3 mm ( @xmath23 ) ( lis & goldsmith 1990 ; lis , carlstrom & keene 1991 ) .",

    "the h@xmath1 mass of @xmath27 610 @xmath28 61 @xmath29 is estimated from the continuum peak intensity .",
    "a similar result , @xmath27 400@xmath29 was reported by zhang , ho & ohashi ( 1998 ) , in which they calculated the mass of w51 north based on a dust temperature of 100 k , continuum peak intensity of @xmath27 2.0 jy  beam@xmath10 at @xmath30 ghz , d of 7 @xmath27 8 kpc and @xmath31 .",
    "if we take @xmath31 , then q(@xmath19 ) @xmath32 at 1.3 mm and then the h@xmath1 mass of @xmath27 535 @xmath28 54@xmath29 is obtained .",
    "a dust temperature larger than 100 k suggests that dust grains are not coagulated with ice mantles , and thus @xmath33 @xmath27 1.5 is a reasonable guess in w51 north ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "therefore the difference of mass between ours and @xmath27 400@xmath29 by zhang , ho & ohashi ( 1998 ) may be caused by taking different value of distance , q(@xmath19 ) and uncertain of flux calibration .",

    "the similar gas temperatures and distributions between oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules ( see  3.3 ) suggest that oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules are well mixed and originate from the same physical environments .",

    "the well mixed nitrogen- and oxygen - bearing molecules based on gas distributions and temperatures in w51 north indicate that the hot core is not very developed in w51 north and grain surface chemistry and evaporating from grain surface into gas phase may be responsible for the high ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 abundance of @xmath66 , since the gas temperature is not so high in w51 north .",

    "1987 ; herbst , giles & smith 1990 ) .",

    "the gas distributions of both oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules show a compact core concentrated on the strongest continuum source , which indicates that nitrogen- and oxygen - bearing molecules are well - mixed in space in w51 north region .",
    "+ 2 . under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the molecular rotation temperatures and column densities are estimated by use of the xclass program .",
    "the oxygen - bearing molecules have higher fractional abundance than the nitrogen - bearing molecules .",
    "the rotation temperatures range from 100 to 200 k , suggesting that the molecular emissions originate from warm environments .",

    "higher fractional abundance of ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath1h@xmath2oh are obtained , which can not explained by gas phase reactions and the two molecules may be synthesized on grain surface . @xmath105/@xmath106 @xmath74 0.32 are much higher than those in other massive star - forming regions , and w51 north is a very ethanol - rich source .",
