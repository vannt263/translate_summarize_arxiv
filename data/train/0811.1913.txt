    "quantum coherence and entanglement in mesoscopic systems are such delicate effects that we usually treat the environment as an inevitable influence to be mitigated against at all costs .",
    "one seeks to isolate the quantum system as far as possible from the environment in order to maintain and observe non - classical effects .",
    "the imaging technique we introduce here is based on the inversion of this viewpoint - the inherently quantum properties of a probe system are deliberately exposed to an environment in a controlled fashion .",
    "the effects of the environment are monitored and analyzed as a function of position .",
    "the resulting scan forms a unique image of the position and behavior of fluctuations in the environment as measured by the direct electromagnetic effects on the probe and its loss of quantum coherence .",
    "the use of qubits as sensitive magnetometers ( or electrometers ) has previously been discussed@xcite as the energy levels , and hence coherent evolution , depends very precisely on its electromagnetic environment .",
    "of particular interest to our proposal is the recent demonstration of a room temperature diamond colour - centre qubit scanning magnetometer system  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a novel imaging mode , rather than increased sensitivity .",
    "monitoring the position dependent probe hamiltonian and decoherence channels allows one to use the scanning quantum system as both a magnetometer / electrometer and as a probe of the decoherence environment _ simultaneously_. as we will show , this imaging mode can reveal new features not observable by other means , as it is sensitive to the temporal as well as spatial variation in the fields created by the sample . for a given sample ,",
    "this provides more than just structural information , it also provides unique information on processes occurring in the sample and _ where _ these processes occur .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we first present the concept of scanning quantum decoherence microscopy in a non - specific way and illustrate its operation with a general example . following this , we present an example using existing technology , where we study a qubit composed of a nitrogen - vacancy defect within a diamond substrate .",
    "we simulate the use of this system in imaging a biological macromolecule with non - trivial magnetic properties .    [",
    "the imaging setup we envisage employs a two - state system ( a qubit ) , based on charge or spin degrees of freedom , attached to the end of a cantilever probe , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the quantum probe is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where the @xmath1 s are the pauli operators and the coefficients ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are functions of both the operating conditions and the probe s electromagnetic environment .",
    "the probe is scanned across a sample and at each point , the hamiltonian and decoherence felt by the qubit is determined through a series of measurements .",
    "the decoherence of the qubit , in particular , is highly sensitive to the fluctuations in the local environment .",
    "thanks ( in part ) to the ongoing work to construct controllable quantum devices  @xcite , a number of techniques have been developed to measure the state or evolution characteristics of an ( open ) quantum system .",
    "these include techniques to reconstruct an arbitrary quantum state or process@xcite , quantum channel@xcite and the hamiltonian governing a few state quantum system@xcite or even spin echo techniques  @xcite from magnetic resonance .",
    "the simplest realisation of decoherence microscopy is to perform a rabi oscillation or spin echo experiment on a qubit which can be moved relative to the background decoherence source . in this case , the measurement procedure ( initialise , evolve , measure ) is used to map the ( ensemble averaged ) time evolution of the system and the decoherence rate is fitted as an exponential decay . with sophisticated measurement schemes and fitting procedures , the image can be acquired more quickly and efficiently . in this paper , we will focus on the technique of hamiltonian characterisation  @xcite and a general weak continuous measurement of the qubit as an example .",
    "it is important to note that the particular choice of continuous measurement and hamiltonian characterisation is not a requirement to perform decoherence microscopy , it simply provides an elegant and efficient realisation but other more established experimental techniques could be similarly applied .",
    "we consider a quantum probe , located at position ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) , suspended a distance @xmath6 above the sample .",
    "the probe is weakly monitored , providing a measurement record @xmath7 .",
    "this measurement record is then correlated and the spectral response @xmath8 computed , see fig .",

    "the hamiltonian and decoherence parameters can then be estimated from this spectral response , for each probe position . if the components of the hamiltonian are plotted as a function of position across the sample ( @xmath9 ) , the probe acts as a sensitive electrometer or magnetometer ( depending on the type of qubit ) , as given in the @xmath9 example in fig .",

    ", we will assume that the flipping rate is slow on the scale of the probe hamiltonian .",
    "the spectral response of the qubit is split , with the separation between the peaks giving the effective difference in the hamiltonian between the two sample spin states ( see appendix  [ sec : methodsiii ] ) .",

    "[ fig : image2d](b ) shows the measured decoherence field over the same sample .",
    "as each spin has a different magnetisation , the decoherence effects ( in this case splitting of the spectral response peak ) resulting from each spin are different .",
    "the ratio of the two split peaks provides the population of the spin states , which is directly related to the magnetisation and effective temperature of the sample spin .",
    "in this plot , the ratio of the split peaks has been used to colour code the data , with blue indicating a large spin magnetisation ( or low effective temperature ) and red a small magnetisation ( high temperature ) .",
    "the intensity of the colour is given purely by the amount of signal available from each decoherence source ( compared to the probe spin s intrinsic decoherence ) , whereas in fig .",

    "the image acquisition times ( for 2500 pixels ) varies between @xmath63 and @xmath64 for pixel error variances which range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "to allow fast image acquisition times ( using continuous a measurement mode ) , it is important to have both large detector bandwidth and a large ratio of bandwidth to intrinsic decoherence rate @xmath67 . the qubit transition frequency is less important , provided it is at least an order of magnitude greater than the intrinsic decoherence .",
    "however , a tunable qubit frequency is advantageous as many types of decoherence depend strongly on the frequency at which they are probed .    to estimate detector noise as a measure ( rather than acquisition time ) , we take recent noise limit estimates for magnetometry based on nv centres  @xcite as a guide . in this case , the measurement is a ` dc ' measurement ( @xmath68 ) with a sensitivity of @xmath69  @xcite and a @xmath70 qubit frequency .",
    "this results in an additional contribution to the pixel variance of @xmath71 but still results in a clear image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uncertexample_m2 ] ) .",
    "we have proposed and theoretically investigated a fundamentally new and complementary imaging mode which takes advantage of current qubit technology and modern techniques for characterising few - state quantum systems . mapping the induced decoherence across a sample indirectly images the dynamics of the environment , providing a new window into the microscopic world with wide applications to spin and charge fluctuations and transport in both solid - state and biological systems .",
    "in contrast to a scanning qubit magnetometer , the decoherence signature is sensitive to fluctuations even when the time - averaged field is close to zero .",
    "such processes abound in nature , in which the time dependent behaviour of electromagnetic fields stems directly from dynamical processes of interest , such as ion flow , spin fluctuations or conformational change .",
    "the device may be realised using a range of architectures , each of which will be sensitive to a particular electromagnetic effect within a sample .",
    "while we have discussed several specific examples using near future technology , the basic requirements for a decoherence microscopy already exist in the form of nano - scale positioning and individual two - state quantum systems which can be initialized , controlled and measured .",
    "hence , this technique has the potential to open a new window for imaging nanoscale processes in the physical and life sciences .",
