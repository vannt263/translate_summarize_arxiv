    "the sjm calculations for the fragmentation processes of metal clusters reported so far @xcite , were based on the assumption that the density parameter @xmath2 takes its bulk value @xmath1 , which we call ` rigid ' sjm . however , since the surface effects have large contributions in the energetics and sizes of small clusters , a more sophisticated use@xcite of the sjm is needed to predict the correct energetics of the clusters in the study of the fragmentation processes .",
    "this method , ` relaxed ' sjm , has already been used to predict the equilibrium sizes and energies of neutral as well as the charged@xcite metal clusters ( this method is also called self - compression method ) . in contrast to the jm and the rigid sjm in which the @xmath2 value is borrowed from the bulk system , in the relaxed sjm , the density parameter of the jellium sphere assumes a value such that a cluster with a given number of electrons and specific electronic configuration achieves its equilibrium state . comparing the relaxed sjm results with the rigid sjm results on the one hand , and the experiment on the other hand ,",

    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the total energies of @xmath4-ply ionized and neutral @xmath11-atom clusters , respectively . however , in fission processes a negative value for the difference energy is not a sufficient condition for the decay of the parent cluster .",
    "this is because the competition between the short - range surface tension and the long - range repulsive coulomb force may give rise to a fission barrier .",

    "these clusters have high stabilities compared to their neighboring sizes . on the other hand , the minima correspond to the sizes which decay into two closed - shell clusters ( for example , ag@xmath57ag@xmath58ag@xmath59 ) .",
    "a negative value for the dissociation energy implies that the cluster is unstable against the spontaneous decay .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , we have shown the most favored products ag@xmath60 and the dissociation energies @xmath61 for the decay of ag@xmath62 via evaporation channel .",
    "it is seen that , here , the mean dissociation energy is higher than that in the evaporation of singly ionized clusters .",
    "that is , here , the number of clusters stable against the spontaneous evaporation is larger than that in the singly ionized case .",
    "however , evaporation is not the only decay mechanism for multiply charged clusters , and they can also decay via fission processes in which both fragments are charged .",
    "figure [ fig7](b ) shows the barrier heights @xmath63 for the most favored fission channels @xmath64 . here , in the relaxed sjm , the coulomb barriers are calculated using the equilibrium sizes of each @xmath4-ply charged fragments i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "as is seen , for small clusters , the majority have negative barrier heights .",
    "that is , most of them are unstable against spontaneous fission . however , as @xmath11 increases , the number of clusters with negative barrier heights decreases and beyond a certain size range , all the barrier heights become positive . as",
    "before , the fragment sizes @xmath52 are shown in the left vertical axis .    as mentioned before",
    ", a doubly charged cluster can decay both via evaporation and fission .",
    "to estimate at what sizes which decay mechanism is dominant , we have compared the dissociation energies and the fission barrier heights in fig . [",
    "fig7](c ) . at small sizes ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the fission process dominates because , the barrier heights for the fission are lower than the dissociation energies for the evaporation .",
    "however , the competition between the evaporation and fission starts at @xmath11=21 .",
    "this competition continues with some fluctuations until the evaporation dominates completely .",
    "ag clusters of sizes @xmath67 and @xmath68 contain @xmath69 and @xmath70 atoms , respectively .",
    "knowing the fact that , in doubly ionized clusters , the induced evaporation is most favored for @xmath71 , we conclude that the ionized clusters of nano - meter size undergo the fragmentation mostly via the evaporation processes .",
    "the rigid sjm fragmentation energies have been calculated by the self - consistent solutions of the ks equations for the system with the positive background density parameter of @xmath1 . in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a)-(c ) , the corresponding fragmentation energies of the relaxed and the rigid sjm are compared .",
    "as is seen , in some cases the energy difference is as large as 0.5 ev , indicating the significant effect of relaxation .",
    "improvements over our relaxed sjm results can be obtained by assuming that , at the instant the fragmentation takes place , the the parent and the products are not at their individual equilibrium state but that , the @xmath2 values of the products are equal to that of the parent at that instant .",
    "thus , in the equations used for the dissociation energies and the fission barrier heights this fact must be taken into account .",
    "the @xmath2 value of the parent cluster at the fragmentation instant ( i.e. , at the instant the two pieces are created ) is something which is between that of the neutral cluster with the same @xmath11 and that of the relaxed @xmath4-ply charged of the same @xmath11 .",
    "that is , @xmath72 for the fission of a doubly charged @xmath11-atom cluster .",
    "the reason for this fact lies in the probabilistic nature of the energy absorption in the ionization process of the neutral cluster as well as the energy absorption in the fragmentation process of the @xmath4-ply charged parent cluster . if the fragmentation energy is absorbed as soon as the electrons are detached from the neutral cluster , then the parent charged cluster does not have enough time for structural relaxation due to its charging .",
    "therefore , the appropriate @xmath2 value would be that of the neutral cluster .",
    "on the other hand , if the absorption of the fragmentation energy takes place with enough delay relative to the ionization instant , then the parent charged cluster has a chance to arrive at its relaxed @xmath2 value .",
    "these arguments lead us to conclude that the experimental fragmentation energies are highly dependent on the details of the experimental setup .",
    "this freedom in taking the @xmath2 values of the clusters in a dynamical process such as fragmentation shows the advantages of the relaxed sjm over the rigid one .",
    "however , in cases where the relaxed and the rigid @xmath2 values are more or less the same , one would expect that applying the time - saving rigid sjm would lead to the same estimates of the fragmentation energies .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the dissociation energies and the fission barrier heights of the fragmentations of singly and doubly ionized silver clusters in the two schemes of relaxed and rigid sjms for different cluster sizes , @xmath45 . in our calculations , we have assumed spherical geometries for the clusters . in the rigid sjm",
    ", the density of the positive charge background is taken to be that of the bulk system , @xmath73 .",
    "however , in the relaxed sjm , that density is obtained in a self - consistent way which corresponds to the equilibrium state of the cluster .",
    "the fission barrier heights are calculated using the two - spheres approximation and for the coulomb interaction of the two metallic spheres we have employed the method of image charges numerically .",
    "the differences in the results of the two schemes show the advantages of the relaxed sjm over the rigid one in that , one is able to take into account the structural relaxations in dynamical processes such as fragmentations ."
