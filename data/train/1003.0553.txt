    "in a seminal paper zhang and rice showed the validity of a single - band effective hubbard hamiltonian starting from a two - band model for the superconducting copper oxides.@xcite although the holes created by doping reside primarily on the oxygen sites , cu - o hybridization strongly binds this hole to the central cu@xmath7 @xmath8 ion of the square planar cuo@xmath0 plaquette to form a singlet , nowadays called `` zhang - rice '' singlet .",
    "this singlet then moves through the lattice of cu@xmath7 ions in a similar way as a hole in the single - band hamiltonian .    around the same time",
    "zaanen and gunnarsson used a three - band hubbard model to describe the cu - o perovskite plane , including the oxygen @xmath9 and cu @xmath10 states and argued that charge and spins in a two dimensional electronic system with strong correlations could form charge and spin density waves with spins being maximal where the charges are absent.@xcite this striped structure appeared also in other theoretical approaches,@xcite but had to wait until 1995 for a convincing experimental verification by elastic neutron scattering in sr / nd doped @xmath11 and oxygen doped @xmath12.@xcite    apart from the formation of striped structures , doped cuprates and nickelates have other similarities , but also obvious differences .",
    "while delocalized holes in the cuprates finally lead to superconductivity , holes in the nickelates experience strong self - localization , and for doping levels less than one the nickelates are insulators . still , on the length scale of a lattice constant the dressed holes or polarons can be seen as non - classical objects . @xcite like in the doped cuprates , the holes in the nickelates are mainly located on the in - plane oxygens , as shown for @xmath13 by resonant soft x - ray diffraction .",

    "although the nmr technique for @xmath22 is severely hindered by signal wipe - out due to magnetic fluctuations below 70  k and by oxygen disordering above 250  k,@xcite we will argue that even in this temperature ( @xmath23 ) range two types of plaquettes can be distinguished on the nmr time scale , and that the results are independent evidence for the dressed @xmath19 picture for the doped plaquettes proposed in ref .  .",
