    "we proceed as follows : consider the family @xmath333 of all processes @xmath145 of the form @xmath334,\\ ] ] where @xmath249 is a positive integer , @xmath335 belongs to @xmath153 $ ] and the stopping times @xmath336 take only a finite number of finite values , with @xmath337 .",
    "let @xmath338 and let @xmath1 be the transform of @xmath0 by @xmath339 . in virtue of doob s optional sampling theorem , @xmath0 is a submartingale .",
    "therefore , by theorem [ main ] , if @xmath340 almost surely , then for @xmath145 as in , @xmath341 now we have that @xmath144 and @xmath112 satisfy the conditions of proposition 4.1 of bichteler @xcite .",
