    "since the early stages of high - energy physics , the detection of sub - atomic particles and the study of their trajectories were often based on visual techniques .",
    "the  nuclear emulsion technique  is a typical example : charged particles crossing emulsion pellicles form a latent image as a trail of sensitised silver bromide microcrystals .",
    "after development a three dimensional  track  can be studied under high magnification by means of an optical microscope .    initially , human observers operated manually the microscope by moving the stage , adjusting the focal plane of the objective , and examining a magnified image through eyepieces .",
    "later , the stage was motorised and the image made available also on a tv screen ; often the stage control and the image analysis performed by the operator were assisted by a host computer , thus configuring the so - called semi - automatic systems .    ideally , the last step in this chain is to let the computer do the image analysis usually performed by the operator to implement the instruments into fully automatic systems .",
    "sysal ( system of salerno ) @xcite is the automatic scanning system developed in the emulsion laboratory of salerno to take part in the emulsion scanning phase of the chorus experiment at cern . in the following chapters we will present features , results and further developments of this automatic multi - tracking system .",
    "the hardware configuration of the system currently at work in salerno includes :    * nikon microscope with @xmath0 @xmath1 stage , with @xmath2 @xmath3 stroke on both horizontal directions , motor driven axes , @xmath4 @xmath5 horizontal position accuracy , 0.5 @xmath6 m vertical position accuracy ; * high - resolution ( @xmath7 pixels ) custom made ccd camera , capable of @xmath8 frames per second at full resolution , and @xmath9 frames per second in @xmath10 mode ( not used ) , with a minimum gate time of @xmath11 @xmath12 ; * custom made stage controller with @xmath13 pid filters for the @xmath13 axes ; * custom made lamp controller ; * matrox pulsar frame grabber card , with @xmath14 mb on - board ; * pc pentium mmx @xmath15 mhz with @xmath16 mb ram on - board , @xmath14 gb hdd ; * auxiliary monitor to see the image coming from the camera to the frame grabber .",
    "the inspiring idea of sysal is very simple at first glance : basically , the computer is asked to reproduce the human process of track recognition presented in the introduction .",
    "the aim is recognizing tracks studying the alignment of their grains through the emulsion layer .    bearing this in mind",
    "one can use a computer to look at the emulsion at different depths ( usually @xmath17 levels for @xmath18 @xmath5 thick emulsions ) and get tomographic images of all the tracks .",
    "these images must then be assembled together for the real pattern recognition to take place .",
    "once all the tracks are reconstructed all the measurements are then easily obtained .",
    "the figure 1 fixes the main steps of the analysis process .",
    "it is clear that , at the end of this process , the multi - tracking system allows to get the whole physical information available ( tracks , kinks and vertices ) .",
    "the scanning process must be smart enough to deal with ambiguous situations and damaged information ( this could come from zones with scratches or dirt on the emulsion surfaces , and from inhomogeneous physical characteristics of the plates ) ; the main aim of an automatic system is , however , to do fast its task , and this has not been forgotten .",
    "most code has thus been written in c++ . when required , assembler has also been used .",
    "the starting point is , of course , the image coming from the camera .",
    "the analog signal is digitized by the pulsar , and converted to a gray scale of 256 levels ( 0 = black , 255 = white ) .",
    "the pulsar stores the data while they come into a 1 mb internal linear buffer ; however , this can not be accessed while it s receiving data . the double - buffering technique helps for the need to have maximum speed : one 1 mb buffer holds an image , making it available to the cpu for analysis , while another buffer grabs the new image .",
    "after all clusters have been formed , they are divided in three classes .",
    "small clusters are discarded ( they mostly come from noise in the camera signal ) ; large clusters ( sometimes called  blobs  )",
    "are discarded too : they are usually surface defects of the emulsion , or grains of heavy nuclear fragments , usually with little energy , not so interesting for the kinematical reconstruction of the interactions .",
    "medium size grains survive , and are used to recognize tracks left from high energy particles .",
    "these should be straight ; indeed , they are quite distorted , due to relaxation of stresses in the emulsion during the developing process . usually , straight tracks are turned into parabolas , in such a way that the point lying at the interface between the emulsion and its support remains in its original position , and the slope of each track at its exit point in air is also left unchanged ( this may happen to be not exactly true , and some corrections can be needed ) . a good multi - tracking algorithm must take into account this phenomenon .    the tracking method is designed to reduce the computing time : to quote a relevant number to understand the kind of job the cpu has to do , it can just be said that , typically , for each of the @xmath17 layers , one can find @xmath19 grains out of @xmath20 clusters , and all of them are , in principle , grains that may belong to a track .",
    "each layer is divided in  cells  , about @xmath21 @xmath22 wide ; then , one looks for alignment of grains in @xmath13 adjacent layers , within cells stacked one on top of the other .",
    "this phase is called  track startup ",
    ": when such an alignment is found , the computer looks for more aligned grains in the next layers , up and down the startup point . during this",
    " track following  phase , the tracking algorithm is also allowed to change the cell stack .",
    "after a new grain is appended , the current slope of the track is recomputed ; this makes it harder to miss next grains , because track distortion is automatically accounted for .",
    "it may happen that , for some reason , on one layer no grain is found belonging to the track being followed .",
    "if this repeats for @xmath23 adjacent layers , the track following phase ends .",
    "while a track is being built , it may cross some already existing track . in this case , if the tracks share three consecutive grains , they are joined together in a single entity .",
    "when a track stops both in the upward and downward directions , the number of points collected is compared with a minimum threshold ( usually @xmath24 points ) , required to store the track in the final array .",
    "after all the tracks in a field have been recognized ( that s why we refer to sysal as a multi - tracking system ) , the next step is to assign each of them some global parameters , such as a slope and an intercept , obtained from a linear fit .",
    "of course , this can not be done with distorted tracks .",
    "so , the tracks that pass the whole thickness of the emulsion layer are used to estimate the distortion vector , which is then used to correct the positions of the grains of all the tracks in the current field .",
    "this correction relies on the assumption that the slope at the exit point is the original one .",
    "sometimes this is not exactly true , and gives rise to some systematic deviation of the computed slopes from the real values .",
    "however , this kind of measurement error is not unrecoverable , and also an off - line correction is possible .",
    "emulsions shrink during the developing process .",
    "so , when they are scanned , the thickness is only @xmath25 of the original one .",
    "the reconstructed tracks are thus finally  expanded  .",
    "the process described above is repeated for each of the two sides of the emulsion .",
    "then , for each track on the upper side , a pairing track on the bottom side is searched , with the same angle and position ( within proper tolerances , typically @xmath23 @xmath5 and @xmath26 @xmath27 ) . when this process is finished all the tracks in the scanning field are reconstructed without any selection in slope so that the whole information present in the emulsion is stored and available for the analysis",
    ".      chorus ( cern hybrid oscillation research apparatus ) @xcite is a short baseline neutrino experiment .",
    "its detector is installed in the west area of the cern .",
    "it is composed of a bulk emulsion target ( four stacks of @xmath28 sheets of emulsion ) interfaced through some emulsion sheets ( called special and changeable sheets ) to the electronic tracking part of the detector ( scintillating fibers ) . after these devices a magnetic spectrometer , a calorimeter and a muonic detector follow ( fig.6 ) .",
    "scintillating fibers provide a prediction for every event that is therefore followed back in the interface emulsion sheets .",
    "then , using measurements in these emulsion sheets as a new prediction , the tracks are followed back in the target stack .    in the following some distributions of differences between predicted and found coordinates ( fig . 7 , 8 and 9 ) and predicted and found slopes ( fig .",
    "10 , 11 and 12 ) are presented for every kind of emulsion sheet used in the chorus experiment .",
    "as it turns out from the latter discussion , sysal is a multi - tracking system .",
    "this means that during the scanning the system pays attention to all the tracks in the field . because of this , some important features are stressed .    reconstructing all the tracks rather than",
    "the single scanback track allows the complete identification of an interaction vertex and of decay topologies .",
    "of course the physically interesting phenomenon is contained in the interactions .",
    "if the particle momentum and energy are known , from the geometrical parameters of a track before and after a kink one can get information on the decaying particle . using the kinematical data of the daughter particles , and geometrical / topological knowledge of a vertex , the complete kinematical reconstruction and the whole on - line study of an interaction is therefore possible .",
    "the sysal approach is indeed the first automatic scanning method that has been specifically designed for the task of recognizing and reconstructing complete topologies .",
    "moreover , the local mapping of tracks near the scanback track can help for the identification of the latter in another sheet of emulsion and can provide information to improve the precision of angle measurement .",
    "this is not all : mapping of wide zones of the emulsion is possible without any further complication and can be successfully used for the intercalibration of two sheets of emulsion .",
    "it follows that flux measurements are very easy to perform .",
    "all these benefits are strictly connected with the choice of a multi - tracking system .      as a sample of the features of a multi - tracking system ,",
    "two interesting events of the chorus experiment are presented .",
    "the good ability of sysal in detecting kinks and in following back the tracks are stressed . together with this two requirements sysal",
    "satisfies the need for an on - line complete study of the event .",
    "the first interaction ( fig.15 ; event 1339/380 ) was produced in the 1994 run of the chorus experiment at cern .    in this case , the interaction point was in the plastic base , @xmath29 @xmath5 upstream of the nearest ends of the tracks in the emulsion ; so the tracks were extrapolated , and their extrapolations were found to cross .    in the following table we show the comparison between the prediction and the real event , as found in the emulsion ; angles are measured with respect to the detector axis ( x ) at the vertex ; the direction of a particle is defined by the angles ( yx , zx ) .    @xmath30    track 4 was not predicted , but was found at the vertex , while another track was predicted and not found .",
    "track 3 was found in two pieces , with different slopes : this sudden variation , after @xmath31 @xmath5 , of a high - momentum particle can not be due to scattering ; so , one can conclude that there was a decay .",
    "one can compute the transverse momentum of the daughter particle with respect to the mother one , by knowledge of the particle direction before the decay .",
    "the angles were ( @xmath32 @xmath27 , @xmath33 @xmath27 ) .",
    "the variation of the particle direction is ( @xmath34 @xmath27 , @xmath35 @xmath27 ) ; the angle between the initial direction and the final one is @xmath36 @xmath27 .",
    "the transverse momentum is    @xmath37    information on the transverse momentum @xmath38 is useful to understand what kind of decay we are analyzing .",
    "a @xmath39 decay into a @xmath40 has a maximum transverse momentum of @xmath41 so , taking into account our @xmath42 , we must give up the hypothesis of such a decay .",
    "but a @xmath43 decay into @xmath40 has a maximum transverse momentum of @xmath44 and is therefore allowed .",
    "this second hypothesis is in good agreement with the lifetime of the particle that can be calculated from the length of its track in emulsion .    from the lorentz transformation relating the momentum in the center of mass with the momentum in the laboratory we yield : @xmath45    now the life time ( @xmath46 ) of the decaying particle can be derived using the relation :    @xmath47    considering once again @xmath48 , we have :    @xmath49    that is in good agreement with the charmed particle decay hypothesis .    concluding we can give the following interpretation of the event :    @xmath50    this study was very quick using the properties of the multi - tracking system that gave us all the topological information related to the event during its scanning",
    ". then same basic relations of the high energy physics allowed us to store and classify the event as a charm decay .",
    "let s analyze the second interesting interaction ( fig.16 ; event 1495/371 ) .",
    "this is a @xmath51 @xmath6 event with the primary interaction vertex in the @xmath52 bulk sheet and a secondary interaction in @xmath53 bulk sheet .",
    "the latter vertex had five tracks , three of them matching with the prediction with a primary charged track .",
    "the scanning was updated and the old scanback track ( @xmath54,@xmath55 ) found at the secondary vertex was changed into the primary charged track ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and followed back in the previous sheet . in the @xmath58 sheet",
    "this track led to the primary interaction vertex and so the topological reconstruction was complete .",
    "unfortunately the kinematics of the event was not completely reconstructed by the chorus detector . at the secondary vertex two of the five reconstructed tracks",
    "were not detected by the spectrometer and therefore their charge and momentum are unknown .",
    "this makes impossible any analysis on the primary charged track .    for the sake of completeness",
    "we must say that the secondary vertex could signal a @xmath59 decay of a @xmath60 that is however a very rare event .",
    "the same can be said for a charmed particle , but identifying it as the interaction of a secondary particle is more reasonable .",
    "the reconstruction of this event was not problematic since the updating of the scanback track is an automatic feature of the system .",
    "a second sample of the ability of the multi - tracking system turns out in the intercalibration procedure . in the chorus experiment , each one of the four stacks",
    "is composed of 36 bulk sheets and so , in order to reach the interaction vertex , the problem of getting all these sheets in the same frame of reference has to be faced .",
    "one of the needs to get a successful intercalibration between two bulk sheets is being able to match two maps of tracks belonging to different sheets .",
    "for example tracks belonging to x7 beam ( a muon beam passing trough the detector , useful to calibrate it ) can be followed .",
    "the procedure becomes harder taking into account that as a first step the special sheet must be matched with the first bulk of the stack . due to the different time of exposure ( 1 year for the special sheet , 2 for the bulk sheet ) about 50% of the tracks in the bulk sheet",
    "are not present in the special sheet .",
    "matching tracks must be followed for 36 bulk sheets , widening the scanning area because of the natural spread of the x7 beam .",
    "the multi - tracking system turns out to be very useful to build map of tracks and to compare them , getting the transformation necessary to switch coordinates of one map to the coordinates of the other .",
    "fig.17 shows two maps of tracks belonging to special and bulk ( target ) sheets , in fig.18 these two maps are matched .",
    "vertex recognition and study using sysal is based on two important features .",
    "the former is , of course , multi - tracking strategy and the latter is the choice of following more than one track for every event .",
    "* intersection of a scanback track in its scanning field with one or more tracks matching with the event prediction ; * disappearance of the scanback track ; * closest approach of two scanback tracks belonging to the same event ( pre - location of the event ) .",
    "[ [ intersection - of - a - scanback - track - in - its - scanning - field - with - one - or - more - tracks - matching - with - the - event - prediction ] ] intersection of a scanback track in its scanning field with one or more tracks matching with the event prediction ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    tracks matching with the scanback prediction are recognized in both side of the emulsion .",
    "intersections between these matching tracks and all the other tracks in the scanning field are calculated ; then a vertex alarm is given if at least one of the other intersecting tracks matches with a track belonging to the event prediction .",
    "vertices located in the second zone of the emulsion sheet shown in fig.20 are usually well reconstructed in both sheets of emulsion ( the vertex plate and the previous one ) .",
    "reconstruction of vertices in the first zone is better in the previous bulk because in the vertex plate there are few grains per track while vertices in the third zone are usually well reconstructed in the vertex plate . for these vertices",
    "the other tracks belonging to the event are often outside the scanning field of the previous bulk so that an intersection is seldom possible",
    ".          intersecting the scanback track with other tracks in the scanning field wo nt be useful to detect quasi - elastic events .",
    "these events consist of only one track predicted by the tracking system and so every intersection is useless .",
    "therefore disappearing of the scanback track can be the winning strategy to detect a kink of this track or the interaction vertex itself .",
    "sometimes it can happen that  missing ",
    "a linked track in a bulk sheet goes together with the presence of a one side track matching with the prediction and intersecting a wide angle track : this can be a further hint of the presence of a vertex .          of course ,",
    "following more than one track per event can be useful to locate the event before reaching it , by calculating the intersection of two tracks reconstructed in the same bulk sheet . to avoid any misleading information coming from kinks it could be wise to follow even three tracks per event .",
    "this study was performed on about 50 closest approaches calculated during the scanning of the stack 3 module 3 top part of the year 1994 .",
    "these closest approaches were derived from pairs of not kinking tracks that led to interaction vertices .",
    "the aim is to check the precision of the measurements of the vertex coordinates and the validity of the closest approach in connection with the extrapolation depth .",
    "fig.23 shows the differences between the predicted ( using @xmath68 ) and the found transverse coordinates of the vertex .",
    "the mean point of the segment representing the closest approach is chosen as the predicted vertex . according to this ,",
    "scanning of only one field of view is necessary to locate the vertex using a @xmath69magnification .",
    "we performed this study using tracks that led to vertices .",
    "therefore this study gives no suggestions about fake closest approaches , generated by pairs of tracks in which there is a fake candidate .",
    "as it turns out from fig.22 @xmath70 increases with the extrapolation depth .",
    "so at long extrapolation depths it is easy to mistake a good closest approach for a fake one and vice versa .              whether in the upper side there is no track in good agreement with the prediction then the lower side of the emulsion can be skipped ; otherwise , centering the interesting track and following down along its direction , a scanning in the lower side of the emulsion can be performed .",
    "the study of intersections of two tracks belonging to the same event together with the information of the event prediction is leading to the elaboration of a new scanning strategy .",
    "the goal is to provide as soon as possible , with the minimum scanning effort , a pair of tracks to locate the interaction vertex .",
    "this scanning strategy is possible for those events with at least three  safe  tracks ( well reconstructed by the detector , with angles @xmath72 ) otherwise a ",
    "scanback scanning must be used .",
    "once the first track is located , using the predicted longitudinal coordinate and the assumption that the vertex is along the direction of this track , it is possible to locate the position of a second track . the second track must be scanned in an area whose dimensions along the two directions in fig.26 are related with the uncertainty on the longitudinal vertex coordinate ( @xmath73 ) and on the predicted slopes of the tracks ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "once two tracks are available their closest approach can be calculated .",
    "if the extrapolation depth is too long it could be wise following the tracks for the number of bulk sheets necessary to get a safe closest approach .",
    "otherwise one can jump directly to the bulk sheet necessary to begin the analysis of the event ( say a few sheets before the vertex plate ) ."
