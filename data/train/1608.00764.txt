    "the first extra solar planet was discovered in the early 1990s by @xcite . today",
    "the statistics of the observations show that the architecture of our solar system seems to be unique compared with exoplanetary systems . at the moment we know about 2000 exoplanets in more than 1200 planetary systems , among them more than 100 exoplanets are in binary - star systems and two dozen are in multiple - star systems .",
    "the data of all planets are collected in the exoplanet - catalogue maintained by j. schneider ; whereas the binary and multiple - star systems can be found separately in the catalogue of exoplanets in binary star systems maintained by r. schwarz , which we will also introduce in this paper . + approximately 70 percent of the main- and pre - main - sequence stars are members of binary or multiple star systems : 67 % for g - m star , e.g. @xcite ; and approximately 70 % for o - b stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". statistics of solar - type dwarfs were studied by @xcite with a distance - limited sample of 4847 targets .",
    "a field population was found of about 54% for single stars , 33% binary stars , 8% triple systems , 4% for quadrupole systems , 1% for systems",
    "observational evidence indicates that many of these systems contain potentially planet - forming circumstellar or circumbinary discs , implying that planet formation may be a common phenomenon in and around binary stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this fact led many research groups to examine the planetary formation and evolution and dynamical stability in binary star systems , either in general or for selected systems @xcite . despite many theoretical studies on the planetary formation in double star systems ,",
    "the formation processes are not entirely understood @xcite .",
    "+ from the dynamical point of view the binary star systems as well as multiple star systems are particularly interesting . according to the work of @xcite",
    "one can distinguish three types of planetary orbits in a binary star system :    1 .",
    "s - type or circumstellar motion , where the planet orbits one of the two stars ; 2 .",
    "p - type or circumbinary motion , where the planet orbits the entire binary ; 3 .",
    "t - type : a planet may orbit close to one of the two equilibrium points @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; we call them trojan planets",
    ". the dynamical study of @xcite could show with a few real binary systems that the t - type configuration is not only of theoretical interest and @xcite could show that t - type orbits can be detected with etv signals .    the graphic representation of the different dynamical scenarios is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the first planet in p - type motion , was detected in 2009 ( hw vir ( ab ) c , * ? ? ?",
    "since that time planets in well detached binary systems become more and more attractive , especially tight coplanar circumbinary planets around short - period binaries @xcite .",
    "further p - type planets were discovered in the following years , where especially the space - mission kepler was very successful . among them are also multiplanetary circumbinary systems , like hw virginis or kepler 47 @xcite . + from the observational point of view well detached binary star systems with separations smaller than 3 au are more interesting than wide binary systems because the observation time for the latter ones is much longer .",
    "furthermore , well detached binaries offer reasonable signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) values for photometry and radial velocity ( rv ) amplitudes @xcite .",
    "a first study of test particles in circumbinary orbits was presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamics of binary star systems with a circumbinary planet , and calculated its eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) for different values of the mass ratio and orbital elements of the binary and the perturbing body .",
    "+ most observations of planets in binaries are focused on @xmath3 ( stars have similar masses ) and are restricted to sun - like stars . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show a distribution of the mass ratios of all detected exoplanets in binaries and we found that the most common mass ratios @xmath4 are @xmath5 and 0.5 .",
    "therefore we use different mass ratios for our simulations for p- and s - type systems .",
    "this paper is divided into three parts : the first part is devoted to the possible detection of exoplanets in well detached binary star systems in p- and s - type motion by the help of eclipse timing variations ( etv ) . in the second part we prepare statistics for well detached binary star systems from several catalogues and discussed the possibility of further candidates .",

    "the photometric detection of extrasolar planets is of particular interest for the discoveries in eclipsing binaries .",
    "we investigated well detached binary star systems , where the initial separation of the stars is 0.5 to 3  au . from the dynamical point of view",
    "these initial separations are very interesting , because planets in s- and p - type orbits are possible and they are supported by the first kepler discoveries of a long ( @xmath7 ) eclipsing binary with a pulsating red giant component  @xcite    we studied the planar full three - body problem ( 3bp ) with numerical integrators . in this problem two finite bodies , the primaries ( @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath9 ) revolve about their common center of mass , starting with three different eccentricities ( @xmath11 ) . a third body @xmath12 moves around @xmath13 for s - type or around both stars for p - type motion in the same plane as @xmath14 .",
    "we have regarded all the celestial bodies involved as point masses and integrated the equations of motion for a time up to @xmath15  yrs for the etv - maps shown in section  [ s ] and  [ p ] and @xmath16  yrs for the stability limits . for our simulations we used a gauss radau integrator with an adaptive step size",

    "* and references therein ) for the etvs and for the stability the lie - method with an automatic step size control to solve the equations of motion . in the s - type configuration we also investigated close - in planets ,",
    "therefore we considered the general relativity in our calculations , @xcite .",
    "we considered well detached eclipsing binaries , with distances between the stars of 0.5 , 1 and 3  au . to ensure that the effect of the variations of the mass ratio @xmath17 of the binary is included in our study , we considered the following three models :    * * model 1 : * @xmath13 = @xmath14 = 1@xmath18 , corresponds to @xmath19 * * model 2 : * @xmath13 = 1@xmath18 and @xmath14 = 0.5@xmath18 , corresponds to @xmath20 * * model 3 : * @xmath13 = 1@xmath18 and @xmath14 = 0.1@xmath18 , corresponds to @xmath21    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the mass ratio of our models is quite common , when we look at the histogram of the detected exoplanets in binaries and multiple star systems .",
    "we changed the other two models ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) because the statistics of other binary catalogues ( section[statistics ] ) are equally - distributed . to get a good estimation about occurring perturbations on the secondary star ( to measure etvs ) we used planets with different masses @xmath22 : earth which corresponds to @xmath23 @xmath18 ] , neptune which corresponds to @xmath25 @xmath18 ] , and jupiter which corresponds to @xmath26 @xmath18 ] .",
    "for the analysis of the orbit we used the method of the maximum eccentricity @xmath27 . in former studies we found a good agreement with chaos indicators like the lyapunov characteristic indicator ( lci )  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath27 method uses as an indication of stability a straightforward check based on the maximum value of the planet s eccentricity reached during the total integration time ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "if the planet s orbit becomes parabolic ( @xmath29 ) the system is considered to be unstable .",
    "the @xmath27 is defined as follows :    @xmath30      since the first exoplanets in p - type motion were detected , the investigation of the eclipse timing variation became more and more important .",
    "the etv signal of the secondary star will be induced by an additional planet .",
    "this gravitational perturbation affects the motions of the two stars and cause their orbits to deviate from keplerian . in an eclipsing binary , these deviations result in variations over time and duration of the eclipse .",
    "this method is particularly important in the case when the planet s orbit is not in the line of sight , which causes the absence of a transit signal .",
    "however , such planets cause perturbations in the orbit of the transiting star , leading to detectable etvs .",
    "similar investigations for transit timing variations ( ttvs ) were done in several articles like e.g. @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the detection of extrasolar planets by the partial occultation on eclipsing binaries was investigated by  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our work was to show which planet sizes for the s- and p - type configurations are detectable in the etv signal of the secondary star with current observational equipment . in order to approximate the detectability of possible extrasolar planets by means of etvs we used the work of @xcite who investigated the sensitivity of the eclipse timing technique for the ground and space - based photometric observations .",
    "they showed in a best - case scenario ( excluding e.g. star spots or pulsations ) , that the typical photometric error ( detectable timing amplitude dt ) for corot is about dt = 4 sec for a brightness ( l ) of 12  [ mag ] and dt = 16 sec for l=15.5  [ mag ] .",
    "kepler has a dt = 0.5 sec for l=9  [ mag ] and a dt = 4 sec for l=14.5  [ mag ] .",
    "future space missions will support the effort to detect smaller planets , like for example :    * plato ( planetary transits and oscillations of stars ) will monitor relatively nearby stars to hunt for sun - earth analogue systems @xcite .",
    "* tess ( transiting exoplanet survey satellite ) space mission is dedicated to detect nearby earth or super - earth - size planets on close - in orbits around the brightest m dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "* cheops ( characterising exoplanets satellite ) will examine transiting exoplanets of known bright and nearby host stars  @xcite .    for our investigations we will use as detection criterion the photometric precision of corot @xmath31  sec as well as that of kepler @xmath32  sec .",
    "we determined the etvs by calculating the amplitude for the perturbed case , where the planet - induced constant rate of apsidal precession is removed by a linear fit .",
    "we also took into account the long - term effects caused by the binaries motion around the systems center of mass and the light travel time effect @xcite .",
    "several observations of exoplanets in detached binaries motivated us to investigate the possible detection of exoplanets with etv s .",
    "therefore we used the configuration `` primary star - planet - secondary star '' with the following initial conditions :    * * masses : * as shown in section  [ models ] we used different masses for the primary and the secondary star ( model 1 , 2 and 3 ) , which we think represents a quite common mass ratio for binaries and might be useful for future observations of different stars ( see discussion section  [ statistics ] ) .",

    "the grid size of the etv maps were changed from 80x80 ( @xmath38x@xmath39 ) for @xmath6 0.1 and 1  au and extended to 160x80 for @xmath6=3  au .",

    "<S> this paper is devoted to study the circumstances favourable to detect circumstellar and circumbinary planets in well detached binary - star - systems using eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the dynamics of well detached binary star systems with a star separation from 0.5 to 3  au , to determine the probability of the detection of such variations with ground based telescopes and space telescopes ( like former missions corot and kepler and future space missions plato , tess and cheops ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the chosen star separations both dynamical configurations ( circumstellar and circumbinary ) may be observable . </S>",
    "<S> we performed numerical simulations by using the full three - body problem as dynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical stability and the etvs are investigated by computing etv maps for different masses of the secondary star and the exoplanet ( earth , neptune and jupiter size ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we changed the planet s and binary s eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that many amplitudes of etvs are large enough to detect exoplanets in binary star systems . as an application , we prepared statistics of the catalogue of exoplanets in binary star systems which we introduce in this article and compared the statistics with our parameter - space which we used for our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these statistics of the catalogue we enlarged them by the investigation of well detached binary star systems from several catalogues and discussed the possibility of further candidates .    </S>",
