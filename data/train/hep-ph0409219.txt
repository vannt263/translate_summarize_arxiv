    "recent cosmological observations , especially the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite , have established the @xmath3cdm cosmological model with great accuracy , and the relic abundance of the cold dark matter is estimated as ( in 2 @xmath4 range ) @xmath5 to clarify the identity of a particle as cold dark matter is still an open prime problem in cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is suitable for cold dark matter , because they are stable owing to the conservation of r - parity . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is typically the lsp and the promising candidate for cold dark mater . in light of the wmap data ,",
    "the parameter space in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) which allows the neutralino relic density suitable for cold dark matter has been recently re - analyzed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the resultant allowed region is dramatically reduced due to the great accuracy of the wmap data .",
    "note that the thermal relic density of the matter depends on the underlying cosmological model as well as its annihilation cross section .",
    "if a nonstandard cosmological model is taken into account , the resultant relic density of the dark matter can be altered from the one in the standard cosmology .",
    "a brane world cosmological model which has been intensively investigated @xcite is a well - known example as such a nonstandard cosmological model .",
    "the model is a cosmological version of the so - called `` rs ii '' model first proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite , where our four - dimensional universe is realized on the `` 3-brane '' located at the ultra - violet boundary of a five dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime . in this setup ,",
    "the friedmann equation for a spatially flat spacetime is found to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 is the hubble parameter , @xmath9 is the energy density of matters , @xmath10 is newton s gravitational constant with @xmath0 being the five - dimensional planck mass , and the four - dimensional cosmological constant has been tuned to be almost zero . here we have omitted the term so - called `` dark radiation '' , since it is severely constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is also constrained by the bbn , which is roughly given by @xmath12 mev ( or , equivalently , @xmath13 tev ) @xcite .",
    "this is a model - independent cosmological constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the original paper by randall and sundrum @xcite , the precision measurements of the gravitational law in sub - millimeter range lead to more stringent constraint @xmath14 tev ( or @xmath15 gev ) through the vanishing cosmological constant condition .",
    "however note that this constraint , in general , is quite model dependent .",
    "in fact , if we consider an extension of the model so as to introduce a bulk scalar field , the constraint can be moderated because of the change of the vanishing cosmological constant condition @xcite .",
    "hence , we care about only the bbn constraint on @xmath11 in this paper .",
    "note that the @xmath16 term in eq .",
    "( [ branefriedmanneq ] ) is a new ingredient in the brane world cosmology .",
    "since at a high energy regime this term dominates and the universe obeys a nonstandard expansion law , some results previously obtained in the standard cosmology can be altered .",
    "in fact , some interesting consequences in the brane world cosmology have been recently pointed out @xcite . especially , the thermal relic abundance of dark matter can be considerably enhanced compared to that in the standard cosmology @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the brane world cosmological effect for the relic density of the neutralino dark matter in detail by numerical analysis .",
    "we will show that the allowed region for the neutralino dark matter in the cmssm is dramatically modified in the brane world cosmology . in the next section ,",

    "note that the results are characterized by the transition temperature rather than the decoupling temperature .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to that in the standard cosmology . using the well - known approximate formulas in the standard cosmology @xcite , @xmath44 we obtain the ratio of the relic energy density of dark matter in the brane world cosmology ( @xmath45 ) to the one in the standard cosmology ( @xmath46 ) such that @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the decoupling temperature in the standard cosmology .",

    "the allowed regions include ( i ) a resonance region which appears in the bulk region , ( ii ) a stau coannihilation region which appears as a narrow strip along the boundary of the stau lsp region , and ( iii ) a higgsino - like region which appears near the no - ewsb region . in the resonance region ,",

    "the range of @xmath70 between the two dash  dotted lines satisfies the wmap constraint . for large @xmath0 @xmath78 @xmath1 tev , the ( too small ) relic density ( @xmath79 0.02 ) in the standard case",
