    "complex networks , evolved from the erds - rnyi random graph @xcite , are powerful models for describing many complex systems in biology , sociology , and technology @xcite . in the past decade , the explosion of the general interest in the structure and the evolution of most real - world networks is mainly reflected in two striking characteristics .",
    "one is the small - world property @xcite , which suggests that a network has a highly degree of clustering like regular networks and a small average distance among any two nodes similar to random networks .",
    "the small - world phenomenon has been successfully described by network models with some degree of randomness @xcite .",
    "the other is the scale - free behavior @xcite , which means a power - law distribution of connectivity , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the probability that a node in the network has @xmath2 connections to other nodes and @xmath3 is a positive real number determined by the given network . the origin of the scale - free behavior has been traced back to two mechanisms that are observed in many systems , growing and preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "recently , with the progress of research in networks , many other statistical characteristics of networks appeared on the stage .",
    "of particular renown is the so - called community(or modularity ) .",
    "that is to say , a network is composed of many clusters of nodes , where the nodes in the same cluster are highly connected , while there are few links among the nodes belonging to different clusters .",
    "for instance , groups are formed in scientific collaboration networks @xcite .",
    "also , it has been found that dynamical processes on networks are affected by community structures , such as tendencies spread well within communities @xcite and diffusion between different communities is slow @xcite .    in the study of community networks ,",
    "most research has been directed in two distinct directions . on the one hand ,",
    "attention has been paid to designing algorithms for detecting community structures in real networks .",
    "a pioneering method was made by girvan and newman @xcite , who introduced a quantitative measure for the quality of a partition of a network into communities .",
    "later , a number of algorithms have been proposed in order to find a good optimization with the least computational cost .",
    "the fastest available procedures use greedy techniques @xcite and extremal optimization @xcite , which are capable of detecting communities in large networks . on the other hand ,",
    "research has focused on modeling of networks with community structures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a static social network was introduced where individuals belong to groups that in turn belong to groups of groups and so on . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a networked seceder model was suggested to illustrate group formation in social networks . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a growing bipartite network for social communities with group structures was proposed .",
    "each of those models is constructed based on one aspect of reality .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a network model with communities that gives a realistic description of local events @xcite .",
    "the model incorporates three processes , the addition of new nodes intra - community and new links intra- or inter - community . using growing and preferential attachment mechanisms",
    ", we generate the community network with a good right - skewed distribution of nodes degrees , which has been observed in many social systems .",
    "the barabsi - albert network @xcite only describes a particular type of evolving networks , the addition of new nodes preferential connecting to the nodes already present in the network .",
    "systems in the real world , however , are much richer . for example , in scientific collaboration networks , a multidisciplinary scientist is not only collaborate with scientists in his research fields but also has a stronger desire to collaborate with scientists in other fields . in friendship networks",
    ", a person usually makes friends with people belonging to different communities besides the community he belongs to . to give a realistic description of the network construction like that ,",
    "we introduce a growing model of community networks based on local events , the addition of new nodes intra - community and new links intra- or inter - community .",
    "the proposed model is defined as follows .",
    "we start with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) isolated communities and each community consists of a small number @xmath6 of isolated nodes . at each time step , we perform one of the following three operations",
    ".    \\(i ) with probability @xmath7 we add a new node in a randomly chosen community . here",
    "the randomly chosen means that the community is selected according to the uniform distribution .",
    "the new node is only connected to one node that already present in the selected community .",
    "we denote it as the @xmath8th commnuity .",
    "the probability that node @xmath9 in community @xmath8 will be selected is proportional to its intra - community degree @xmath10 where the sum runs over nodes in community @xmath8 and @xmath11 is the intra - community degree of node @xmath9 in community @xmath8 .",
    "\\(ii ) with probability @xmath12 we add a new link in a randomly chosen community . for this",
    "we randomly select a node in a randomly chosen community @xmath8 as the starting point of the new link .",
    "the other end of the link is selected in the same community with the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ nodeprob ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) with probability @xmath13 @xmath14 we add a new link between two communities . for this",
    "we randomly select a node in a randomly chosen community @xmath8 as the starting point of the new link .",
    "the other end @xmath9 of the link selected in the other community @xmath15 is proportional to its inter - community degree @xmath16 where the sum runs over nodes in all communities except for community @xmath8 and @xmath17 is the inter - community degree of node @xmath9 in community @xmath15 .",
    "after @xmath18 time steps , this scheme generates a network of @xmath19 nodes and @xmath18 links .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 control the network structure .",
    "in the case of small @xmath13 , the generated network will have a strong community structure .",
    "notice that whatever process is chosen in the network growth , only one link is added to the system at each time step ( duplicate and self - connected edges are forbidden ) , however , this is not essential .",
    "we choose link probabilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be proportional to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , such that there is a nonzero probability of isolated nodes acquiring new links .",
    "in our community network , the degree of a node consists of two parts , the intra - community degree and the inter - community degree .",
    "increase in the node s connectivity can be divided into two processes , the increases of the intra - community degree and the inter - community degree . in each process , we assume that @xmath24 and @xmath25 change continuously , and the probabilities @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be interpreted as the rates at which @xmath24 and @xmath25 change , respectively . thus , the operations ( i)-(iii ) all contribute to @xmath28 , each being incorporated in the continuum theory as follows .",

    "the first term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) corresponds to the random selection of one end of the new link , while the second term on the rhs reflects the preferential attachment ( eq .",
    "( [ nodeprob ] ) ) used to select the other end of the link .",

    "so we write the solutions of eqs .",

    "( [ degreeintra ] ) and ( [ degreeinter ] ) , respectively .",
    "the small deviations between computer simulations and analytical solutions at both ends of the distributions appears to be the mathematical approximation of the boundary conditions and the finite size effect due to the relatively small network sizes used in the simulations . according to the evolving rule of our network ,",
    "nodes with larger intra- ( or inter- ) degree have higher probability to gain new links , then the usual degree preferential attachment is reasonably kept .",
    "this means that the right - skewed character of the network , such as the node s total degree , will retain . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , the total degree distribution of nodes is well expected showing a good right - skewed character , which is reasonably in agreement with the condition of many realistic systems @xcite .    to illustrate the predictive power",
