    "assuming newtonian gravity , and its extension into general relativity , describes gravitational forces correctly , astronomical and cosmological observations show that most of the matter in our universe is a non - luminous , neutral form of matter , called dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "quantitatively , it accounts for @xmath4 of all matter @xcite .",
    "there are many possible dm candidates @xcite . among those , weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps )",
    "have been studied in most detail .",
    "there are several reasons for the popularity of wimps . if they once were in full chemical equilibrium with the particles of the standard model ( sm ) , which is true if the largest temperature after the most recent period of entropy production exceeded about 5% of the wimp mass , the wimp relic density can be calculated unambiguously for a given cosmological model , independent of initial conditions , using only particle physics quantities ( masses and couplings , or cross sections ) as input .",
    "this calculation yields approximately the observed relic density for roughly weak  strength wimp annihilation cross sections .",
    "this not only hints at a deep connection between dm and extensions of the sm addressing some of its shortcomings @xcite , it also allows various ways in which the existence of wimp dm can be probed . unfortunately these probes have so far not yielded an unambiguous signal .",
    "successful wimp candidates must therefore not only satisfy the relic abundance constraint , but also constraints coming from direct @xcite and indirect @xcite detection experiments .",
    "in standard cosmology it is assumed that the comoving entropy density remained constant since the epoch when wimps were in full thermal equilibrium with sm particles .",
    "the quantity of interest is then the ratio @xmath5 of the wimp number density @xmath6 and the entropy density @xmath7 . in order to compute the temperature dependence of @xmath6 ,",
    "one thus needs to know the precise temperature dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the expansion rate , described by the hubble parameter @xmath8 , is proportional to the square root of the total energy density @xmath9 ; hence the temperature dependence of @xmath9 also has to be known . in early analyses @xcite @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "were calculated ignoring all interactions between sm particles , i.e. treating the thermal plasma as a relativistic free gas .",
    "this is quite a good approximation for most temperatures .",
    "however , it was realized early on @xcite that this approach fails for temperatures near the deconfinement transition , i.e. the transition from hadronic ( pions , kaons ,  ) to partonic ( quarks , gluons ) degrees of freedom .",
    "more recently it was realized that also for some range of temperatures above this transition the interactions between quarks and gluons should not be ignored @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carefully model the effect of strong interactions on the temperature dependence of the energy and entropy densities .",
    "we exploit recent calculations performed in the framework of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model well below the deconfinement transition @xcite , smoothly matching to results from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) at @xmath12 mev @xcite .",
    "we find that this can change the predicted relic density by more than 5% compared to earlier treatments @xcite of strong interaction effects on the thermal plasma .",
    "we then use our improved treatment of strong interaction effects to determine the value of @xmath13 , the thermally averaged product of wimp annihilation cross section times relative velocity of the annihilating wimps , that is required to reproduce the correct relic density , under the assumption that @xmath14 is independent of temperature . as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the wimp mass , this product can deviate by up to a factor of @xmath15 in either direction from the `` canonical '' value of @xmath16 @xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "this is important since experiments are now beginning to be sensitive to the canonical cross section .",
    "for example , analyses of fermi - lat gamma ray observations of nearby dwarf galaxies and of the diffuse gamma ray emission in the galaxy have , for some combinations of wimp masses and wimp annihilation final states , constrained the wimp annihilation cross section to be lower than the canonical one @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we have assumed that @xmath20 particles are self  conjugate ( majorana ) particles . with minor modifications our results",
    "can also be applied to particles that are not self  conjugate , such as dirac fermions or complex scalar particle . in this case",
    "one will in general have to track the densities of particles and antiparticles separately .    since the total entropy is assumed to be conserved , @xmath25const . where @xmath26 is the scale factor in the friedman  robertson ",

    "most papers on the calculation of the wimp relic density focus on the annihilation cross section .",

    "this `` hadron resonance gas model '' was used in all subsequent calculations at sufficiently low temperatures , including our own .",
    "one problem of the simple definition of the transition temperature used in ref.@xcite is that it leads to a discontinuity in @xmath46 .",
    "ref.@xcite therefore used smooth functions interpolating between the hadronic and partonic phases . while these functions ensure that not only @xmath46 and @xmath33 , but also their derivatives are smooth , they were not based on dynamical considerations .",
    "the authors advocated estimating the uncertainty by using two quite different values , 150 and 400 mev , for the transition temperature .",
    "the same functions were used in ref.@xcite ; the functions for a transition temperature of 150 mev are still used by default in the computer packages mentioned above .",
    "the first attempt to include the results of lattice qcd calculations was due to hindmarsh and philipsen @xcite . at that time",
    "the most accurate lattice qcd calculations did not include dynamical quarks .",
    "there was some evidence that the ratio of the true pressure to the corresponding value for non  interacting particles shows little dependence on the number of quark flavors @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite therefore scaled the contribution of all strongly interacting partons by the same correction function , determined from pure glue lattice calculations @xcite ; at @xmath73 gev , these were matched to perturbative calculations @xcite .",
    "the treatment by laine and schroeder @xcite is rather similar .",

    "in particular , they point out that charm quarks make non  negligible contributions already at temperatures of a few hundred mev .",
    "we now describe own treatment . at temperatures well above the electron mass",
    ", we treat all sm particles without strong interactions as free particles , i.e. we use eqs.([gfree ] ) and ( [ hfree ] ) for these particles .",
    "this includes the leptons , the electroweak gauge bosons as well as the single physical higgs boson of the sm .",
    "note that for the physical higgs mass , @xmath75 gev , in the standard model electroweak symmetry breaking leads to a smooth cross  over , not a phase transition @xcite ; hence the comoving entropy density remains constant , as assumed in the derivation of eq.([boltz1 ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we compute @xmath46 and @xmath33 using free , massive @xmath76 and @xmath77 bosons ( with three d.o.f .",

    "the difference between these treatments is very small , and will only affect the relic density of wimps with masses above 2 tev .",

    "the second , much lower peak near @xmath177 tev is probably due to lack of knowledge of the top mass at the time when ref.@xcite was written .",
    "the spike in @xmath56 predicted by the micromegas treatment of the results of ref.@xcite gives prominent spikes in the ratios shown in fig.[relicpercentage ] .",
    "these spikes are numerical artefacts that result from the smoothing procedure used in micromegas .",
    "as argued in ref.@xcite , a true @xmath178 function spike in @xmath56 should not affect the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation , which necessarily entails some discretization .",
    "the probability that the program then has to evaluate the right  hand side of the boltzmann equation at the precise value of @xmath149 where the @xmath178 function diverges is zero .",
    "we nevertheless show results including this spike since it results from the `` standard treatment '' encoded in micromegas . outside the mass range affected by this spike , the results of ref .",

    "a decrease of @xmath55 therefore goes into the same direction as a decrease of @xmath56 .",
    "however , the fact that the relative difference between our calculation and the prediction based on ref.@xcite is almost the same in both frames of fig .",
    "[ relicpercentage ] at large wimp masses shows that the main effect still comes from the change of @xmath56 .",
    "we saw in fig .",
    "[ doffig ] that the prediction for @xmath56 from ref.@xcite lies below our prediction , except for a very narrow range of temperatures around @xmath95 . as a result , for pure @xmath2wave annihilation",
    "the prediction for the relic density based on the treatment of ref.@xcite lies above our prediction for all wimp masses larger than 2 gev .",
    "we argued above that the relevant range of temperatures is ( even ) smaller for pure @xmath3wave annihilation .",
    "this explains why the blue curve in the lower frame of fig .",

    "note also that the predictions using our treatment agrees with the prediction using ref.@xcite to better than @xmath181 for all wimp masses , except in the range between @xmath182 and @xmath183 gev where the difference reaches @xmath184 for pure @xmath185wave annihilation .",
    "in order to put these results into perspective , it should be noted that the lattice qcd predictions for the energy and entropy densities listed in table 1 of @xcite , on which our treatment is based , still have significant uncertainties , which decrease from about @xmath186 at @xmath187 mev to about @xmath188 at @xmath189 mev .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty in the relic density is up to @xmath190 for @xmath191 gev @xmath192 gev .",
    "finally , we note that treating the charm quark as a free particle would increase the predicted relic density by about @xmath193 for @xmath194 gev .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ relicpercentage ]",
    "are almost independent of the assumed value of the wimp annihilation cross section as long as the relic density comes out at least roughly correctly , although they evidently are sensitive to the functional dependence of @xmath195 on the temperature .",
    "eq.([appsol ] ) shows that thermodynamic effects enter primarily through @xmath196 , and @xmath179 depends on the annihilation cross section only logarithmically .",
    "on the other hand , the exact value of the annihilation cross section that reproduces the correct relic density , now ( within standard @xmath197cdm cosmology ) constrained to be @xmath198 @xcite , does depend on @xmath199 and , to a lesser extent , on @xmath200 .",
    "precise knowledge of this cross section is important to constrain the free parameters of models of thermal wimps .",
    "moreover , as we will see in more detail below , indirect dm searches now begin to probe annihilation cross sections close to the required value of @xmath13 , _ if _ the latter is ( approximately ) independent of the temperature .    , assumed to be completely independent of temperature , required to obtain a thermal relic density @xmath201 within standard cosmology , as a function of wimp mass.,width=491 ]    in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav ] we show the required value of @xmath202 , assumed to be independent of the temperature , for a majorana fermion , obtained from our refined calculation of @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "this updates the results of ref.@xcite , which assumed @xmath203 and used @xcite to compute @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "we see that for @xmath204 tev @xmath205 gev the required value of @xmath13 is in fact closer to @xmath206 @xmath207s@xmath18 than to the `` canonical '' , often cited value of @xmath208 @xmath207s@xmath18 .",
    "the near constancy of the required value over such a large range of wimp masses results from an `` accidental '' cancellation of two effects .",
    "this can again be understood from the approximate analytical solution ( [ appsol ] ) of the boltzmann equation .",
    "on the one hand , increasing @xmath51 increases @xmath179 , which _ increases _ the relic density .",
    "since @xmath179 depends only logarithmically on @xmath51 , the freeze  out temperature @xmath209 still increases as @xmath51 is increased . as shown in fig .",

    "the required value of @xmath14 would thus increase logarithmically with @xmath51 , in order to cancel the effect of the increase of @xmath179 .",
    "however , since by dimensional analysis and unitarity arguments @xcite @xmath214 , it is very difficult to find scenarios with sufficiently large wimp mass for @xmath211 tev .    on the other hand , for wimp masses below 10 gev the rapid decrease of @xmath210 with decreasing @xmath212 shown in fig .",
    "[ doffig ] requires a rather rapid increase of @xmath13 , to a peak value of about @xmath215 @xmath17s@xmath18 . finally , for @xmath216 gev",

    "since @xmath179 keeps decreasing with decreasing @xmath51 , keeping the relic density constant requires that @xmath13 also decreases logarithmically with decreasing wimp mass for these very light wimps .",
    "in this section , we will compare experimental constraints from indirect wimp searches and from analyses of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with our prediction for @xmath19 shown in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav ] . since the cmb decoupled much later than wimps did , and hence also at a much lower temperature ( @xmath219 ev rather than @xmath220 ) ,",
    "while wimps in galaxies now have an average kinetic energy of @xmath221 , such a comparison is meaningful only if @xmath13 is largely independent of the temperature .",
    "if @xmath222 , as in pure @xmath3wave annihilation , or for even stronger @xmath223dependence , the bounds on @xmath13 from the cmb and from indirect wimp searches are still several orders of magnitude above the value required to obtain the correct relic density .",
    "currently the strongest and most robust upper bounds on @xmath195 from indirect wimp searches come from searches for hard @xmath224 rays by the fermilat collaboration .",
    "photons travel in straight lines through our galaxy , whereas charged particles get deflected by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this not only introduces a sizable uncertainty , since our knowledge of this magnetic field is far from perfect ; it also isotropizes the arrival directions of the wimp annihilation products , making it impossible to focus on regions of space where the wimp signal should be particularly strong .",
    "another advantage of @xmath224 rays is that they are present in nearly all possible final states : hard photons can be emitted directly off final or intermediate state particles , can originate from the decay of neutral pions and other hadrons that result from the hadronization of @xmath225 final states or the decay of @xmath226 leptons , and can be produced from energetic electrons or positrons through `` inverse compton '' upscattering of ambient photons .",
    "the strongest wimp signal is expected from near the center of our own galaxy .",
    "unfortunately this region also hosts several backgrounds , both in form of point sources and in form of extended emission .",
    "it has been claimed that there is evidence for an additional component in the gev @xmath224 flux from near the galactic center which can be explained through wimp annihilation @xcite , but other interpretations of this additional component exist @xcite .",
    "we also note that the fermilat collaboration itself has not published any analysis of their data on the galactic center .    in this paper",
    "we therefore focus on fermilat observations of nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast to big galaxies like our own , the mass density of dwarf galaxies should be dominated by dark matter even in the central region , yielding a much better signal  to  background ratio for indirect wimp signals .",
    "no such signal has been seen .",
    "our analysis is based on the very recent 6year `` pass 8 '' analysis @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav+experiment ] .",
    "we see that the upper bound on @xmath13 is strongest if wimps predominantly annihilate into @xmath227 final states , but the bound for wimp annihilation into @xmath228 is only slightly weaker . for the @xmath229 final state",
    "the upper bound on the cross section is similar for wimp masses below 40 gev , but is somewhat weaker for heavier wimps ; hadronic final states have higher multiplicity , and hence higher @xmath224 flux per wimp annihilation , for larger wimp masses , whereas for the @xmath230 final state the photon multiplicity is essentially independent of the wimp mass .",
    "these constraints exclude wimps with mass @xmath231 to @xmath232 gev annihilating into hadrons or @xmath226 leptons with temperature independent @xmath13 .",
    "is compared with several observational upper bounds on @xmath13 , which is assumed to be independent of temperature .",
    "the cyan , green and magenta curves follow from the fermilat upper bound @xcite on the @xmath224 flux from dwarf galaxies , for different dominant wimp annihilation channel ( @xmath233 or @xmath230 ) , whereas the red curve results from an upper bound on spectral distortions of the cmb , assuming wimp annihilation into @xmath121 pairs.,width=491 ]    as mentioned above , wimp annihilation into @xmath121 can produce hard photons through upscattering ambient , e.g. visible , photons .",
    "the corresponding upper bound on @xmath13 ( not shown ) is worse than that for wimp annihilation into @xmath229 by a factor of about two to three @xcite , excluding wimps with mass @xmath234 gev annihilating into @xmath121 pairs for the value of @xmath13 shown in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav ] .",
    "wimp annihilation can also affect the cmb .",
    "the strongest limits on @xmath13 originate from the fact that wimp annihilation heats up the plasma in the `` recombination '' epoch when neutral atoms first formed @xcite , thereby delaying the decoupling of the cmb photons and distorting the pattern of cmb anisotropies . in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav+experiment ] we show the bound on the wimp annihilation cross section into @xmath121 pairs that results from an analysis @xcite of data from the wmap and act collaborations .",
    "it excludes a thermal wimp with @xmath235 gev .",
    "planck data will lead to considerable stronger constraints @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these papers only cite upper bounds on the product of the wimp annihilation cross section and an efficiency factor @xmath236 with which the energy of the wimp annihilation products is absorbed in the thermal plasma .",
    "using results from ref.@xcite , we estimate that the latest planck data exclude wimps with @xmath237 gev annihilating into @xmath121 pairs with temperature independent cross section ; see also the recent analysis @xcite .    since the efficiency factor should be similar for the other final states considered in fig .",
    "[ newsigmav+experiment ] , the cmb constraint should also be similar for all channels .",
    "the current cmb constraint is thus weaker than the bounds derived from the most recent fermilat data if wimps mostly annihilate into @xmath225 or @xmath230 final states , but is stronger for wimps annihilating predominantly into @xmath121 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the cmb constraint is less direct .",
    "it is conceivable that additional non ",
    "standard ingredients to the cmb fit ",
    "e.g. , the presence of sterile neutrinos , a significant running of the spectral index of inflation , and/or a large contribution from tensor modes  can ( partly ) compensate the distortions caused by early wimp annihilation , thereby weakening the constraint on @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the constraint derived from the observation of dwarf galaxies depends on the assumed dark matter distribution @xcite . in any case , it is encouraging that recent astrophysical and cosmological observations begin to probe relatively light thermal wimps with temperature independent annihilation cross section .",
    "using recent lattice qcd results with dynamical quarks for the equation of state , we have computed the energy and entropy densities of the sm with emphasis on temperatures around the deconfinement transition at @xmath84 mev .",
    "these results are described by the functions @xmath46 and @xmath33 . of particular relevance for the calulcation of the relic density of thermal wimps",
    "is the quantity @xmath56 defined in eq.([gstar ] ) , which also depends on the derivative of @xmath55 with respect to the temperature .",
    "our results for these functions can readily be embedded in the public codes computing the relic density @xcite .",
    "our predictions for the wimp relic density differ from earlier treatments that relied on phenomenological models or pure glue lattice qcd calculations .",
    "these differences are most pronounced for wimp masses between 3 and 15 gev ; they can reach about @xmath168 for a constant @xmath13 , and up to @xmath169 if @xmath238 as in pure @xmath3wave annihilation away from poles and thresholds .",
    "these differences are partly due to a spurious divergence in @xmath33 leading to a divergence in @xmath56 , which results in a sharp spike in the standard implementation .",
    "this illustrates the importance of ensuring that @xmath33 is continuous everywhere , not just during the deconfinement transition but also during electroweak symmetry breaking at @xmath239 gev , which we essentially ignored in our treatment .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainties in the recent lattice calculation we used still translates into an uncertainty of the predicted relic density of up to @xmath190 , considerably larger than the observational uncertainty ( at least in the framework of the standard @xmath197cdm cosmology ) . on the other hand , for @xmath240",
    "gev our result for the relic density agrees to better than @xmath181 with the best previous calculation @xcite .",
    "we used our improved treatment of the thermodynamics of the very early universe to update the calculation of the wimp annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed dark matter relic density , assuming the thermal average @xmath13 to be independent of temperature .",
    "we found that this cross section is indeed nearly constant for @xmath241 , thanks to a fortuitous cancellation between two competing effects ; however , as also pointed out in ref.@xcite , the required value is closer to @xmath206 @xmath17s@xmath18 than to the often  cited `` canonical '' value of @xmath16 @xmath17s@xmath18 . on the other hand , for @xmath242 gev",
    "the required value of @xmath14 exceeds @xmath243 @xmath17s@xmath18 . producing a sufficiently large annihilation cross section for such light wimps typically requires the introduction of new light `` mediators '' between the wimps and sm particles .",

    "[ newsigmav ] .",
    "we also compared the required value of @xmath13 with upper bounds on this quantity that come from searches for energetic @xmath224 rays produced in wimp annihilation as well as from cmb constraints .",
    "the most recent planck data most likely give the strongest upper bounds , although a dedicated analysis for specific final states has not yet been performed .",
    "moreover , the cmb bound assumes standard @xmath197cdm cosmology , and can thus more easily be evaded than the bounds from @xmath224 ray searches .",
    "all of these bounds can be evaded if the wimps predominantly annihilate into neutrinos @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that both our calculation of the required wimp annihilation cross section and our analysis of observational upper bounds on this quantity assumed that the thermal average @xmath195 is independent of temperature , or , equivalently , that the annihilation cross section is independent of the invariant center  of  mass energy . theoretically this assumption is not well motivated . for non  relativistic wimps the annihilation cross section",
