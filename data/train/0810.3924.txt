    "the inert doublet model ( idm ) extension of the particle standard model has recently attracted attention within the particle physics and cosmology community . despite its simplicity - a two higgs doublet model with an imposed unbroken @xmath0 parity -",
    "it displays a remarkably rich phenomenology . after being touched upon already in the 1970s @xcite",
    "the model has in later years been studied within various contexts such as light neutrino generation @xcite , leptogenesis @xcite , higgs phenomenology @xcite , improved naturalness @xcite , electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , and as a dark matter candidate @xcite .    besides the standard model - like higgs boson , @xmath1 , the idm contains three additional scalar fields : two neutral , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and one charged , @xmath4 . because of the exact @xmath0 parity none of the new particles have direct ( yukawa- ) couplings to fermions and",
    "are hence called _ inert _ scalars ( or sometimes even inert higgs bosons @xcite ) . because the new doublet still couples directly to @xmath1 and the gauge bosons ( and does not generate standard model masses )",
    "some have preferred to instead denote the model the dark scalar doublet model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 parity also ensures the stability of the lightest inert scalar , which hence , if it is either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , constitutes a good dark matter candidate belonging to the class of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . for masses below 80 gev",
    "it can leave a relic abundance in agreement with the wmap constraints @xcite and hence explain all the dark matter @xcite .",
    "another striking property of the idm is that it can allow for a heavy ( @xmath5 gev ) standard model higgs boson @xmath1 without violating data from electroweak precision tests @xcite . although the direct higgs searches are not in conflict with the 95% c.l .",
    "upper higgs mass bound set by the precision tests ( assuming only standard model physics ) , they are well above the indicated central value @xcite . if upcoming accelerator searches fail to detect a light ( @xmath6 gev ) higgs boson , the idm may constitute an attractive explanation .",
    "although the idm ( in contrast to _ e.g. _  supersymmetric models ) seems to lack any deeper fundamental motivations , its strength instead lies in its simplicity , and the model can be regarded as an archetype for more comprehensive extensions of the standard model ( like @xcite or @xcite ) . just like generic spin-1/2 and spin-1 wimps could be represented by the supersymmetric neutralino and the first kaluza - klein excitation of the photon , respectively , the lightest inert particle could be used as a representative of spin-0 wimp dark matter candidates .",
    "experimental bounds and signatures of the idm have been investigated in several papers .",
    "studies show that the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section in general lies below the sensitivity of current deep underground direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "the prospects for indirect detection via gamma - rays produced in dark matter self - annihilation processes in the galactic halo look more promising @xcite , especially since inert scalar dark matter has the ability to produce extraordinarily clear spectral lines @xcite .",
    "lep i data on the width of the @xmath7 boson force the sum of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses to be larger than the @xmath7 mass @xcite , while the lep electroweak precision tests put constraints on the inert scalar mass splittings as a function of the @xmath1 mass @xcite . moreover , detection at the upcoming lhc seems feasible @xcite .",
    "what has been missing so far in the investigation of the idm is a closer study in connection with the existing lep ii data .",
    "so far the lep ii limits on the idm are only rough estimates based on direct usage of production cross section limits from existing analyses of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "although this may be suitable as a first approximation , there are certainly some important differences between the idm and the mssm which threaten to alter the conclusions .",
    "in this paper we take a closer look at the limits lep ii data can set on the idm .",
    "we make use of an existing delphi collaboration study of neutralino pair production @xcite where detailed signals and backgrounds have already been simulated . by generating @xmath8 events and mimicking the cuts performed on the dataset in @xcite",
    ", we can estimate upper limits on the corresponding production cross sections .",
    "these limits are then used to constrain the masses of the inert scalars .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the idm setup in more detail and discuss its theoretical and experimental constraints . in section iii",
    "we motivate the need for a more careful lep ii analysis , and introduce the method used here to constrain the idm parameter space .",
    "in section iv we present the results , and discuss those in connection with dark matter .",
    "section v includes some final remarks and conclusions .",
    "a short summary of this paper is given in section vi .",
    "appendices a and b provide detailed lists of the cuts used for the acoplanar jets and acoplanar leptons selections , respectively .",
    "although electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved with a single higgs doublet , a more complicated higgs sector is not excluded .",
    "since problems like dark matter and neutrino mass generation seem to require new physics beyond the standard model , minimal extensions could be considered as attractive models compatible with the principle of occam s razor .",
    "a simple and well known extension of the standard model higgs sector is the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) , in which there exist two scalar doublets , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in order not to be in conflict with the tight constraints on the magnitude of flavor changing neutral currents a @xmath0 parity , under which @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is imposed .",
    "the most general renormalizable and cp conserving potential of such a model is @xmath13\\!\\!,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real parameters . whether the higgs doublets develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) or not of course depends on the values of the parameters in the potential @xcite .",
    "even if one usually assumes that both doublets develop vevs , there is _ a priori _ nothing which requires that phase .",
    "the idm is a thdm where only one of the higgs doublets , @xmath9 , acquires a vev , @xmath16 .",
    "hence , @xmath9 closely corresponds to the ordinary standard model higgs doublet .",
    "moreover , the idm belongs to the class of type - i thdms in which all standard model fields are taken to be @xmath0 even . as a consequence",
    "no yukawa terms including @xmath10 are allowed by the symmetry .",
    "the nonexistence of a vev , @xmath17 , for @xmath10 leaves the imposed @xmath0 parity unbroken and ensures the absence of mixing between the components of @xmath9 and those of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the fields belonging to @xmath10 are inert in the sense that they do not couple directly to fermions , and the lightest of them is automatically stable .",
    "it should be noted that the idm is not the @xmath18 limit of a thdm in which both higgs doublets develop vevs .    after giving masses to the gauge bosons , @xmath9 has one physical degree of freedom left : the real scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 closely resembles the higgs particle of the standard model it will here be called the standard model higgs boson . in addition",
    ", @xmath10 includes the neutral cp - even @xmath2 , the neutral cp - odd @xmath3 , and the charged @xmath4 inert scalars .",
    "the masses of the particles are ( at tree level ) given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vev of @xmath9 .",
    "( the measured gauge boson masses determine @xmath21 gev . )    if either of the electrically neutral @xmath2 or @xmath3 constitutes the lightest inert particle , it could be a good wimp dark matter candidate . by assuming @xmath22 we",
    "will from now on have @xmath2 as our potential dark matter particle , although the roles of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in general interchangeable .",
    "the mass difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 is frequently appearing in calculations , and for later convenience we define @xmath23      the requirements of vacuum stability and perturbativity set theoretical constraints on the model . if and only if @xmath24 the potential @xmath25 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) is bounded from below , ensuring a stable vacuum .",
    "we will follow @xcite and adopt @xmath26 as sufficient conditions for a perturbatively well - behaved model .",
    "observational constraints come from direct and indirect detection experiments , measurements of the cosmic microwave background , and accelerator searches .",
    "the absence of wimp - nucleon scattering signals in existing direct detection experiments disfavors models very close to having a peccei - quinn symmetry @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "other direct detection constraints on the idm parameter space are not considered in this work [ 4,8 ] .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indirect detection through gamma - rays produced by annihilating @xmath2 pairs in and around the galactic center has been studied in several papers @xcite .",
    "although idm models ( with @xmath28 and large values of @xmath29 ) have been shown capable of producing spectacularly clear monochromatic line signals @xcite , the absolute photon fluxes are subject to large astrophysical uncertainties . also , the most interesting photon energy range has not yet been covered ( but is currently examined by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is not yet possible to derive any robust constraints from indirect detection .    the wmap data on the cosmic microwave background radiation limits the relic abundance of dark matter , @xmath30 , to 0.094 @xmath31 0.129 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km mpc@xmath32s@xmath32 .",
    "the lower bound need only be respected if the idm alone is to solve the dark matter problem .",
    "however , the relic density of @xmath2 particles must always respect the upper bound , since they otherwise would contribute to too much cold dark matter .    while the electroweak precision tests in the absence of new physics beyond the standard model favor a light higgs boson , this does not remain true once the inert scalars are taken into account . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the inert particles make important contributions to the electroweak observable @xmath33 according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fine - structure constant . with appropriate inert scalar mass splittings",
    "the idm can hence compensate for the otherwise too small values of @xmath33 arising for heavy standard model higgs bosons . from fig .  1 in @xcite we have estimated the allowed @xmath36 range ( at 68% c.l . ) as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "together with eq.([eq : deltat ] ) this translates into the constraint @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as first noted in @xcite and more explicitly argued in @xcite the precise lep i measurements of the @xmath7 boson width forbids the decay channel @xmath38 .",
    "hence it is required that @xmath39    when it comes to limits set by the lep ii experiments , previous studies have provided rough estimates based on existing analyses for neutralinos , @xmath40 , within the mssm . by simply applying the same upper limits on the @xmath41 cross section as those set by the different lep collaborations on @xmath42 production , one finds that the lep ii data seem capable of ruling out important parts of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "these observations bring up the question of what restrictions a more specific study of @xmath43 production could put on the idm parameter space .",
    "although a complete analysis including optimization of cuts , a detailed detector simulation and standard model background event generation would put the most accurate lep ii limits on the idm , it also demands a lot of effort to be carried out . on the other hand , the earlier estimates of lep ii",
    "constraints @xcite are quite coarse and , as motivated below , need to be improved ( or possibly verified ) . in this work we have therefore chosen to reuse cuts , detector acceptances , simulated backgrounds and derived production cross section limits from an existing mssm analysis @xcite , and instead focus on idm signal event generation and efficiency determination .",
    "this method , which will be described in detail in section iii b , is careful enough to put more accurate limits on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses than the current existing estimates ..    the different lep experiments have separately searched for neutralinos via the production process @xmath44 followed by the decay @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the lightest neutralino , @xmath46 , is assumed to be stable and would show up as missing energy , while the fermion pair , @xmath47 , could be detected as acollinear jets or leptons .",

    "the production of @xmath54 pairs only proceeds via s - channel spin-1 @xmath7 bosons , @xmath55 , forcing the spinless outgoing scalars into states with large transverse momentum , while neutralinos have the ability to conserve angular momentum with the help of their intrinsic spin .",
    "moreover , neutralino production differs in that it can also take place via t - channel selectron exchange .",
    "similarly , @xmath3 only decays according to @xmath56 , while both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are allowed ( where @xmath59 denotes a sfermion ) . figs .",

    "to illustrate observable outcomes we take help of the event generator madgraph / madevent @xcite , which is to be further discussed in section iii b. a comparison between the angular distributions of @xmath44 and @xmath60 indicates that there are significant differences between the two processes .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the angular probability distribution of produced @xmath61 and @xmath3 for representative models with various neutralino and inert scalar masses .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath3 is mainly produced with large transverse momentum , while the @xmath61 distribution is closer to isotropic .                      once including the decay processes one would expect the angular distribution of final state particles to get a bit smeared out . in order to properly include spin correlation and off - shell effects the full @xmath62 and @xmath53 matrix elements , shown in figs .",

    "however , the analysis of @xcite does not include any spin correlation effects and we hence focus on the factorized @xmath65 , @xmath64 process , figs .",
    "[ fig : susy8](a)-(d ) , for the neutralinos .",

    "[ fig:4 ] shows the angular probability distribution of the final state fermions for the same models as in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . since we factorize the mssm processes , and since the inert scalars carry no spin , an isotropic decay in the rest frame of the mother particle ( @xmath61 or @xmath3 )",
    "is expected .",
    "this makes the final angular distributions considerably flatter , and the mssm and idm models typically produce rather similar results , see figs .",
    "[ fig:4](b)-(c ) .",
    "however , if the velocity of the mother particle is large and the energy injected into the @xmath47 pair during the decay is relatively low , the boost can preserve some significant difference . in other words , the mssm and idm final fermion distributions will still differ for models where the center - of - mass energy , @xmath66 , is well above the kinematical limit for neutralino / inert scalar pair production , while at the same time the mass difference between the produced particles is small , see fig .  [",
    "fig:4](a ) .",
    "noteworthy , this is exactly the interesting dark matter preferred region of rather light @xmath2 ( @xmath67 ) together with a considerable amount of coannihilation with @xmath3 ( @xmath68 gev ) @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that there are of course other observables than individual scattering angles which may differ between the mssm and the idm models .",

    "[ fig:5 ] shows the @xmath47 opening angle distributions , where clear differences are seen in figs .",
    "[ fig:5](b)-(c ) . which observables are important depends on what cuts are imposed , and in general it can be hard to extract any reliable information without doing a more complete analysis . in any case , it should be clear from the above examples that there exist differences between the mssm and the idm which could hinder a direct application of the existing lep ii neutralino production cross section limits on the inert scalars .",
    "we therefore find it well motivated to study the lep ii bounds on the idm more closely .        a delphi collaboration search for pair production of neutralinos in the center - of - mass energy range 192208 gev @xcite forms the basis of this paper . in @xcite",
    "the absence of an excess above the standard model background in the delphi data was used to put upper limits on neutralino production cross sections .",
    "the analysis included a careful standard model background generation and a detailed detector simulation .",
    "the signal events were produced with the help of susygen 2.2004 @xcite , and jetset 7.4 @xcite was used for quark fragmentation .",
    "every event was tested against a number of searches with cuts optimized for different final state topologies , each using a sequential cuts approach .",
    "these searches , which are described in detail in @xcite , were ordered according to 1 ) acoplanar jets , 2 ) acoplanar leptons , 3 ) multijets , 4 ) multileptons , and 5 ) asymmetric taus , and an event being accepted by one of the selections was explicitly rejected by those appearing later in the list . however",
    ", the searches were designed to be mutually exclusive in order to substantially reduce the possibility of events being capable of passing more than one of the searches .",
    "based on the resulting efficiencies for simulated signal events , 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on neutralino production cross sections were derived and presented as functions of neutralino masses in contour plots . of interest for this paper",
    "are figs .",
    "12 and 13 in @xcite where @xmath69 production followed by @xmath61 decay into @xmath46 plus a fermion pair ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or according to the branching ratios of the @xmath7 boson ) was assumed",
    ". direct translation of these kinds of plots is what previously has been used to estimate rough limits on the idm .",
    "the basic strategy of this work is simple : simulate @xmath60 events , pass them through the same cuts as those used in @xcite to determine idm signal efficiencies , and finally rescale the upper limits on production cross sections derived in @xcite in accordance with the ratio between the mssm and idm efficiencies .",
    "however , in reality the full analysis of @xcite is not practically possible to reproduce in full detail .",
    "instead we rely on slightly different codes for event generation , a rough detector simulation , and a somewhat simplified set of cuts .",
    "thus a reevaluation of also the mssm efficiencies is required , both for consistency and in order to check the reliability of our method .",
    "the free parameters of the r - parity conserving mssm considered by @xcite are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the gaugino mass parameters @xmath79 and @xmath75 are assumed to be related according to the msugra unification relation : @xmath80 0.5@xmath75 . by",
    "choosing a high common scalar mass parameter @xmath81 tev , @xcite put focus on models with sfermions much heavier than the produced neutralinos . for fixed values of @xmath73 (",
    "_ i.e. _ the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ) , @xcite performed scans over @xmath75 and the higgs mass parameter @xmath74 to find models with suitable values of the @xmath46 and @xmath61 masses .",
    "the common trilinear coupling @xmath77 and the pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath78 typically have no noticeable influence on the results .",
    "because of the assumed unification relation between @xmath79 and @xmath75 , there are no models with the mass of @xmath61 much larger than twice the mass of @xmath46",
    ". therefore @xcite considered @xmath82 production followed by the decay @xmath83 when they explored larger neutralino mass differences . however , their notation was to not explicitly write out any @xmath84 , but instead use @xmath61 for any heavier neutralino .",
    "we follow the same convention here .",
    "although one can in general find several points within the ( @xmath73,@xmath75,@xmath74 ) parameter space giving the same set of ( @xmath46,@xmath61 ) masses , the differences in efficiencies are typically small .      for the generation of signal events we use the madgraph / madevent package @xcite .",
    "there are two main reasons for this choice : 1 ) it is possible to generate both mssm and idm events with madgraph / madevent .",
    "2 ) the code allows multiparticle final states , giving the opportunity to generate the complete @xmath85 processes in one step , thus fully taking spin correlation and off - shell effects into account . in agreement with @xcite",
    ", the mssm processes are factorized into @xmath65 , followed by either @xmath86 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 .",
    "the decays are arranged to be isotropic in the rest frame of @xmath61 , after which the decay products are boosted into the lab frame .",
    "the idm events , on the other hand , are generated via the unfactorized processes @xmath89 , where @xmath47 represents either @xmath70 , @xmath71 , or @xmath72 . as a consistency check",
    "we also study numerous unfactorized mssm processes as well as factorized idm processes . although slight deviations in for example the angular distribution of produced particles can be found between the factorized and unfactorized mssm processes , the discrepancies left at the level of efficiency determination are quite small . for the idm",
    "this agreement is even better .",
    "we fix the center - of - mass energy @xmath66 to 206 gev in our analysis , and note that the final results hardly depend on the exact value .",
    "pythia 6.4 @xcite is used for the fragmentation and hadronization of final state quarks , and jets are reconstructed with the pyclus algorithm .",
    "the minimum transverse jet separation is set to @xmath90 gev , while at the same time requiring at least two reconstructed jets , all in agreement with @xcite .",
    "different cuts are imposed depending on whether the final state includes quark or lepton pairs .",
    "we mimic the cuts of the acoplanar jets search and the acoplanar leptons search in @xcite as closely as possible , and apply them to the quark and lepton events , respectively .",
    "muon and electron identifications are performed with the help of tabulated acceptances extracted from an earlier detailed study of the delphi detector @xcite .",
    "given the four - momentum of the lepton , a probability for identification is assigned and used to generate identification status .",
    "because of _ e.g. _ our lack of a detailed detector simulation , some of the cuts have to be somewhat simplified , and some are not even possible to carry out",
    ". however , much effort has been put into accounting for all major effects in order to assure the reliability of our final conclusions .    in principle",
    "an event not passing the acoplanar jets or acoplanar leptons cuts could instead happen to be accepted by one of the subsequent searches ( _ i.e. _  the multijets , multileptons , or asymmetric taus selections ) .",
    "owing to the design of the searches we expect these events to be quite rare , and that the relative mssm and idm efficiencies in any case can be fairly represented by the corresponding results from the acoplanar searches .",
    "we therefore only impose one set of cuts on each event : the acoplanar jets ( for @xmath70 final states ) or the acoplanar leptons ( for @xmath71 and @xmath72 final states ) selections .",
    "the exact selection cuts are described in appendices a and b.      we start our analysis by generating ( on average a handful of different ) mssm models for each set of ( @xmath46,@xmath61 ) masses considered .",
    "we create the models using the spectrum generator suspect 2.34 @xcite , and feed them into madgraph / madevent to simulate mssm events .",
    "in total we generate more than @xmath91 @xmath69 events distributed among roughly 200 different mssm models .",
    "efficiencies are then calculated by passing the generated events through our cuts . as a reliability check of our analysis ,",
    "the found efficiencies are compared with those of table 8 in @xcite .",
    "although an exact agreement is too much to demand , the ratios between our calculated efficiencies and those in @xcite should at least stay rather constant for all ( @xmath46,@xmath61 ) mass points .",
    "indeed we find that this ratio stays in the interval 0.71.0 for most models , a result accurate enough for our needs .",
    "some larger deviations occur , but this happens mainly in not very important regions of the parameter space , and can possibly be understood by taking into account the uncertainties in the jet energy determination by the true detector .",
    "see section v for further discussion .",
    "within the idm the cross sections for production of @xmath43 events are on the other hand completely specified once @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given , and hence only one model for each set of ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) masses needs to be examined . again madgraph / madevent is used to simulate ( about @xmath94 ) signal events , which are subsequently taken through the same cuts in order to extract the corresponding idm efficiencies .",
    "we can now determine the ratio between our calculated mssm and idm efficiencies as a function of the produced neutralino / inert scalar masses .",
    "these are then used to rescale the cross section upper limits presented in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that although the 14 mass combinations given in table 8 in @xcite serve as our starting check points , we investigate many more to cover the complete ( @xmath92,@xmath93 ) plane and to be more detailed around more critical regions .    in the decay of @xmath3 ,",
    "fermion pairs are produced at tree level via s - channel @xmath7 bosons , and the branching ratios into fermions are therefore expected to be close to those of an on - shell @xmath7 boson .",
    "it is therefore natural to focus on the cross section limits provided by fig .",
    "13(d ) in @xcite , where the final fermions are assumed to be produced in accordance with the branching ratios of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "this is clearly appropriate for models with a large mass splitting @xmath95 ( and specifically when @xmath96 so that @xmath7 can be on - shell ) , but some modifications may be needed for models where the intermediate @xmath7 boson is very virtual and the branching may be somewhat different .",
    "in other words , when @xmath95 is small we need to evaluate the branching ratios to find out whether some modifications might be needed ( this calculation is done with madgraph / madevent ) .",
    "finally , we calculate the @xmath43 production cross section as a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and compare it with our derived cross section upper limits in order to constrain the idm parameter space .",
    "contour the limits are rescaled by a factor 0.9 ( 1.1 ) before being applied to @xmath8 production .",
    "the solid ( dark blue ) contour lines indicate the @xmath41 cross section .",
    "the ( red ) dotted - shaded region , where @xmath97 , is excluded by lep i data on the z boson width . the upper right dashed line shows the lep ii kinematical limit . ]    under our imposed cuts the resulting idm and mssm efficiencies turn out to be quite similar , an appealing , although not at all trivial , result .",
    "the efficiencies are first determined for each individual channel ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , after which those are combined into an efficiency representing the actual branching ratio .",
    "this combination is done by weighting the channels in accordance with the decay branching ratios of the z boson ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath70 efficiency is given the highest weight ) .",
    "in general we observe that the ratio between our derived idm and mssm efficiencies is quite insensitive to the very details of the imposed cuts , and we estimate our sensitivity in determining this ratio to be of the order of 10 % .",
    "we find that whenever @xmath98 gev the idm efficiencies typically are a few percent higher than those of the corresponding mssm models .",
    "an important observation is that we find no mass combinations in this region where the mssm gives a higher efficiency than the idm , and it is therefore appropriate to apply at least as hard production cross section upper limits on the inert scalars as those put on the neutralinos in @xcite .    in the specific region defined by 8 gev @xmath99 15 gev and @xmath100 gev ,",
    "the idm efficiencies are found to be about a factor 1.15 - 1.20 higher than those of the mssm . on noting that the models with the lowest @xmath95 have a slightly higher branching into neutrinos compared to ordinary z boson decay , we in this region adopt a conservative factor of 0.9 with which we rescale the neutralino production limits given in fig .",

    "[ fig : idm3b_excl_dm ] the lep ii data can exclude many idm models of interest from a dark matter perspective , although definitely not all of them .",
    "although we find that appropriate upper limits to impose on the production cross section for inert scalars are similar to those already derived for neutralinos in @xcite , this result is _ a priori _ far from trivial owing to the different properties of the particles .",
    "it is encouraging that the effect of including realistic selection efficiencies is not to invalidate , but rather to increase the confidence in simple applications of limits from other mssm searches directly onto the idm .",
    "however , one must keep in mind that rather different sets of cuts may be used in other searches , and hence any robust prediction requires an evaluation of the corresponding idm efficiencies .",
    "one may worry that some of the simplifications used in this analysis misses some important effects .",
    "for example we do not include any initial state radiation from the incoming @xmath72 pair .",
    "while this is certainly important for the models excluded by lep i which satisfy @xmath115 ( and for which the intermediate s - channel z bosons can be put on - shell by radiating off photons from the incoming particles ) we do not expect the initial state radiation to be very important for our mass range of interest .",
    "another concern is that the detector generally fails to detect some amount of the energy in high energy jets . on assuming a perfect jet energy determination we indeed find that for models with @xmath116 gev our derived mssm efficiencies do not match those of @xcite as well as they do for lower @xmath95 models .",
    "however , by artificially scaling down the jet energy of each event with on average 10%-20% before applying the cuts we find good agreements also for these models .",
    "an important observation to keep in mind is that we find the ratios between the idm and mssm efficiencies to be practically insensitive to the downscaling magnitude .",
    "therefore our final idm limits do not depend on the very details of the true energy losses . also , the @xmath43 production cross section is in general too low within the high @xmath95 region for any models to be excluded anyway .    in @xcite",
    "the acoplanar searches were each divided into four subselections ( these subselections are the last 1)-4 ) cuts presented in each of appendices a and b ) . within their analysis",
    "these were treated as independent selections , and we should hence actually check the efficiencies under each of them separately when trying to extract the idm limits . however , the ratios between our derived idm and mssm subselection efficiencies are found to be practically equal to the values for the corresponding complete acoplanar selections .",
    "we hence conclude that this does not constitute a problem for our method .",
    "while our analysis certainly includes some approximations , we have consistently been quite conservative in order to minimize the risk of overestimating the final constraints on the idm .",
    "hence , our derived lep ii limits on the inert scalar masses should be robust .",
    "in this paper we have investigated what limits can be inferred on the idm from an already existing lep ii neutralino search . in performing this translation",
    "we have used a method respecting the differences between inert scalars and neutralinos .",
