    "magnetic fields on the sun exhibit fine structure which is conditioned by the fine structure of the solar surface in general and its active regions in particular @xcite .",
    "the first supporting evidence for the fine structure of magnetic fields was found in the 1960s , initially in strong fields in spots and later in quiet regions @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields outside spots were found to be unevenly distributed over the surface , in the form of dense magnetic fluxes in very small areas ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "kilogauss strengths of these compact magnetic features were initially measured in faculae and in the supergranular network by the line - ratio method @xcite .",
    "these results were confirmed more than once in later studies . according to @xcite , the typical size of magnetic concentrations is 100300  km ,",
    "typical strength is 100200  mt , the velocity does not exceed 1.2  km  s@xmath1 and is 0.5 km  s@xmath1 on the average .",
    "the field strength scatter is very small .",
    "the authors of @xcite concluded that 90 percent of the photospheric magnetic field is concentrated in compact kilogauss structures and 10 percent is found in quiet regions with a mean flux density of 0.20.3  mt .",
    "further investigations revealed that fine compact magnetic features have a filamentary structure and look like tubes with their diameter growing with height in the atmosphere ( the mushroom or canopy effect ) .",
    "they are tilted most probably at an angle of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the temperature in them is higher in the middle and upper photosphere and is lower in the lower photosphere as compared to the quiet sun , and the chromospheric temperature growth begins in deeper layers as compared to the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "analyses of all available data revealed a wonderful property of these magnetic structures  despite some distinctions in size , field strength , and orientation , they all are much alike in form and in their magnetic and temperature properties .",
    "because of this , they were pooled to form a separate class of solar magnetic structures and were called the small - scale magnetic elements or magnetic flux tubes @xcite . the number of flux tubes on the solar surface increases with decreasing tube size .",
    "although each magnetic element adds very little to the general solar radiation flux , millions of magnetic elements not only compensate for the energy blocked in spots but even produce some additional radiation ( about 0.1 percent @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic flux tubes can form clusters of various sizes .",
    "these clusters are assumed to form larger magnetic structures such as the active supergranular network , faculae , and plages . at present",
    "the smallest ( 120  km ) magnetic elements resolved in observations are the so - called bright points of magnetic network @xcite .",
    "concurrent with the refinement of observation techniques , theoretical models of magnetoconvection in quiet regions on the sun have been developed .",
    "much research was devoted to numerical simulation of magnetic elements , their formation and interaction with convective motions ( see review @xcite ) .    in this study we use two - dimensional mhd models developed by gadun @xcite . unlike other researchers",
    ", he used an original approach to the solution of the equations of radiation magnetohydrodynamics @xcite which describe a compressible , gravitationally stratified turbulent medium .",
    "the magnetic field is described by the vector potential , so that the divergence of magnetic field strength is always zero in the simulation region .",
    "the initial magnetic field is specified by a bipolar magnetic configuration . the first sequence of 2d mhd models @xcite of completely nonstationary solar magnetogranulation extended over a long time period ( two hours of solar time ) . with such models ,",
    "the evolution of solar magnetic elements , their structure and dynamics could be studied in detail on scales much smaller than the spatial resolution of the present - day observations .",
    "three - dimensional models ( e.g. , @xcite ) are certain to give more realistic flow patterns , while two - dimensional models more adequately represent small - scale phenomena , and they still remain useful in studying the properties of magnetic elements . analyses of 2d simulations of convection @xcite and magnetoconvection @xcite suggest that 2d models reproduce quite well many features of 3-d convection .",
    "the major results of 2d magnetoconvection simulations on granulation scales obtained by gadun were presented in @xcite .",
    "investigations into the mechanism of formation and destruction of flux tubes and into their stability conditions revealed that thermal flows are the most important factor in the evolution of small - scale magnetic fields .",
    "fragmentation of large - scale thermal flows can result in the formation of vertical magnetic elements from horizontal magnetic surface flows .",
    "this previously unknown mechanism of flux tube formation was called the surface mechanism @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of formation of kilogauss flux tubes through convection collapse was also investigated , and some spectropolarimetric manifestations of this process were found @xcite .",
    "mhd models @xcite pointed to the emergence , reconnection , and recycling of magnetic flux near the surface , and these processes were demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "nonstationary mhd models @xcite can serve as an analog of some observed photospheric regions with average unsigned strength of magnetic fields of 4050  mt . these heterogeneous models , which are more realistic than two - component models , were also used to calculate the stokes profiles of photospheric lines @xcite .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the @xmath0 profiles of the ir line fe  i @xmath9 1564.8  nm @xcite gave a magnetic field intensity distribution which is in good agreement with observations of magnetic fields in quiet regions @xcite and which confirms the two - component structure of intra - network fields .",
    "the magnetic field in the solar plasma is closely associated with the velocity field , and this association inside sunspots as well as in the quiet solar atmosphere still is one of the most difficult problems in solar physics .",
    "the freezing of magnetic field in the moving plasma ( or its rigid connection with velocity field ) can be weakened due to the fine structure of this magnetic field @xcite .",
    "that is why the study of dynamic processes in magnetic elements , and inside strong flux tubes in particular , by the magnetoconvection simulation techniques is of current interest , inasmuch as the magnetic elements still are not spatially resolved because of their small horizontal size .",
    "numerical mhd simulations @xcite suggested that a large variety of dynamic processes should be expected on scales of several hundred kilometers inside and outside flux tubes .",
    "recent highly accurate polarimetric observations in the line fe  i @xmath9 630.25  nm with a spatial resolution better than 700  km @xcite yielded some statistical relations between the observed stokes @xmath0-profile parameters which are indicative of substantial systematic motions in the magnetic elements in the network , faculae , and quiet regions .",
    "we believe that the reproduction of some observed spectropolarimetric effects @xcite with the use of 2d  mhd models @xcite is of obvious interest .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to determine the dynamical characteristics of magnetic elements in the solar photosphere .",
    "below we give some principal results of observations of the magnetic element dynamics , a description of the 2d mhd models we use , and the results of the application of the line - ratio method to these models .",
    "we also analyze our calculations of the stokes @xmath0 profiles , their shifts , asymmetries , and center - to - limb variations on scales smaller than or comparable to the spatial resolution of present - day observations .",
    "studies based on complex magnetographic observations of magnetic fields and line - of - sight velocities revealed that the vertical velocities are equal to zero , on the average , at the chromospheric network boundaries as well as inside network cells @xcite , while the line - of - sight velocities determined from spectropolarimetric observations were contradictory @xcite . early extensive polarimetric observations with fourier spectrometers ( fts ) with high spectral resolution and low spatial and time resolutions ( about @xmath10 and 30 min ) detected no significant systematic motions ( above 0.25 km  s@xmath1 ) inside flux tubes @xcite .",
    "this result differed essentially from a mean velocity of 0.5  km  s@xmath1 derived earlier in @xcite . only observations with high spatial resolution ( @xmath11 ) 32 detected a small predominance of downflows with a mean velocity of 0.2 km  s@xmath1 and the dependence of this velocity on the size of magnetic elements . in regions with small filling factor , downflows were stronger and the velocity scatter increased from @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 to 1.5  km  s@xmath1 . the mean velocity measured in @xcite was about 0.8  km  s@xmath1 , and the scatter increased with decreasing amount of polarization .",
    "theoretical simulations of the interaction between convection and magnetic field @xcite also confirmed the existence of systematic motions outside and inside flux tubes on small spatial and temporal scales . a most impressive evidence that dynamic processes are stronger inside magnetic elements",
    "was given in recent studies @xcite .",
    "systematic downward motions observed with a spatial resolution of 0.8@xmath13 were found to have mean velocities of 0.50.7  km  s@xmath1 . in magnetic elements with small filling factor the velocities were as high as @xmath14  km  s@xmath1 , while they were smaller in elements with large filling factor or in clusters .",
    "some evidence for large horizontal velocities of about 2  km  s@xmath1 in magnetic elements was given in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the zero - crossing doppler shifts , the asymmetry of observed @xmath0 profiles is used for the diagnostics of motions in flux tubes .",
    "this asymmetry detected for the first time in @xcite from fts observations near the disk center was `` blue '' , i.e. , the amplitude and area of the shortwave peak were greater , on the average , than in the longwave peak , the amplitude asymmetry being several fold greater than the area asymmetry .",
    "the general trends found in @xcite have been confirmed by observations made with various resolutions , but the asymmetry magnitude slightly decreased with growing resolution .",
    "numerous investigations demonstrated that the @xmath0 profiles owe their asymmetry to the combined effect of the magnetic field and velocity field gradients inside flux tubes and around them @xcite .",
    "a large number of profiles with extremely large asymmetries were recently found in observations with resolutions below 700  km .",
    "for example , three percent of all fe  i @xmath9 630.25  nm line profiles observed in the network regions and in faculae have such asymmetries @xcite .",
    "atypical @xmath0 profiles , especially those which have one wing only , are of special interest .",
    "they were shown in mhd simulations to appear mainly at the periphery of magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "extremely large asymmetry can be caused by strong downflows below the canopy near flux tube boundaries .",
    ", horizontal axis ) column number @xmath15 in the mhd model ; distance between the columns is 35 km . ]",
    "so , polarimetric observations with high spatial resolutions demonstrated that the dynamical characteristics of magnetic elements have a much wider range than that assumed before . what can we expect from observations in which the structure of magnetic elements will be resolved ?",
    "we tackled this question with the use of the results of the 2d mhd simulation of magnetic elements and the synthesis of the stokes profiles of the fe  i @xmath9 630.25  nm line .",
    "the sequence of mhd models we use here was described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the simulated region 3920@xmath161820  km in size had 112 vertical columns ( rays ) with a 35-km spatial step .",
    "the starting magnetic field had bipolar decreasing with growing height , the mean unsigned field strength was 5.4  mt .",
    "the magnetic field was evolving in the course of two - hour simulation , and its unsigned strength grew to 50  mt on the average .",
    "strong flux tubes are formed after a lapse of 50 min of simulation .",
    "they disintegrate and form again in the simulation region . in one of the snapshots displayed in fig .",
    "1 two kilogauss flux tubes of different polarities can be seen to approach each other and to destroy one the other a short time later .",
    "the horizontal size of flux tubes at the level of visible surface ( @xmath17 ) varies from 35  km to 350  km in the course of evolution , and the maximum strength of their fields varies correspondingly from 40  mt to 250  mt .",
    "the largest area ( about 50 percent ) is occupied throughout the simulation time by flux tubes with diameters of 80180  km and field strengths of 100200  mt @xcite .    our study is based on a sequence of the snapshots of half an hour s duration after 94 minutes of simulation with a 30-s step .",
    "this is a period when strong flux tubes are intensely evolving .",
    "two flux tubes of opposite polarities are often formed in the simulation region . as a rule ,",
    "flux tubes are accompanied by nearby weak fields of opposite polarity . in upper lateral layers of flux tubes",
    "hot regions appear as a result of deceleration of strong granulation flows near the tube walls .",
    "these hot regions may be analogs of observed bright points @xcite .",
    "predominantly horizontal magnetic fields are observed in the central parts of granular cells .",
    "all these peculiarities of the simulated magnetogranulation can be seen in the vertical section of the simulation region ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume that the selected snapshots sequence represents the quiet sun regions with some network elements because the unsigned field strength distribution mode is 35  mt in the simulation region and the flux density is 0.2  mt @xcite .",
    "the mhd models we use were tested in @xcite . here we continue to test them by the method of field strength ratio measured in two spectral lines @xcite .",
    "this well - known method was widely used for the diagnostics of strong magnetic fields outside active regions on the sun in low spatial resolution spectra ( 1@xmath18 ) @xcite , and now it is applied to high - resolution spectra ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the effectivity of the line - ratio method depends on the model atmosphere chosen for the field strength calibration , so that the method also needs testing with models which are more realistic than the two - component models commonly used for calibration @xcite . applying this method to mhd models",
    ", we can test the models and the method itself .    as in observations ,",
    "we chose two fe  i lines  @xmath20 524.71 and 525.02  nm .",
    "their atomic parameters are nearly the same , and only the lande factors differ ( their ratio is 1.5 )",
    ". therefore , the ratios of calibrated magnetograph signals in two lines  @xmath21 or @xmath22  should be insensitive to all atmospheric parameters except field strength , magnetic field inclination , and velocity field . as shown in @xcite , the `` magnetic ratio ''",
    "also depends on the position of the selected @xmath0-profile section with respect to the profile center  as the magnetograph slit approaches the line center , the ratio decreases .",
    "the line ratio also depends on the filling factor in the resolved area and on lateral magnetic field profile .",
    "thus , the magnetic field strength found by the line - ratio method depends on the spatial and spectral resolutions of observed spectra .",
    "we determined the ratio of @xmath0 signals as a function of distance to line center @xmath23 $ ] for the profiles in different simulation regions .",
    "the doppler shifts of @xmath0 profiles with respect to the central wavelength of @xmath24  profiles were compensated .",
    "figure 2 illustrates three @xmath25 relations .",
    "one relation was derived from profiles averaged over a @xmath26 region with a relatively weak subkilogauss flux tube ( @xmath27  mt ) , the second relation refers to an area of the same size with two strong flux tubes with @xmath28  mt , and the third relation is based on the profiles corresponding to the axis of a strong flux tube with @xmath29  mt at the level @xmath30 ( without spatial averaging ) .",
    "we also plotted the relations for the ratios @xmath31 ( observations from @xcite ) and @xmath32 $ ] ( fts observations of regions with strong and weak faculae @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic ratio is greater at greater distances from line center and is greater than unity in distant line wings . at lower resolutions ,",
    "the relation is less steep and the magnetic ratio is smaller ( cf curves 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the run of relation 2 ( the region with two strong flux tubes and with low resolution ) is in good agreement with observation data , and this supports our earlier inference @xcite that the theoretical mhd models @xcite represent quite well the actual magnetic fields on the sun .",
    "the run of the @xmath25 relations derived for different magnetic fluxes from mhd models is the same as the run derived earlier with the use of two - component models @xcite .",
    "these relations roughly represent various cases of magnetic saturation and various long - wave shifts of @xmath0 signals in different sections of the profiles of two lines .",
    "kilogauss fields not only diminish the @xmath0-profile amplitude but substantially change the profile shape as well . in strong fields",
    "the @xmath33 profile is lower and wider than the @xmath34 profile , and the ratio of magnetic saturations in two lines becomes reverse at a distance of 57 pm from the line centers : @xmath35 becomes greater than unity .",
    "so , the @xmath36 relations we derived clearly demonstrate that the magnetic fields measured by the line - ratio method heavily depend on the line section ( @xmath37 ) chosen for the measurements .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0-profile amplitudes @xmath38 , which is independent of @xmath39 , is sometimes used in polarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "we determined the amplitude ratio for 5824 @xmath0 profiles calculated in every mhd model column ( fig .",
    "there is a correlation between the `` magnetic ratio '' and the amplitude @xmath40 : the ratio decreases , on the average , with increasing @xmath0-profile amplitude , and this suggest that the magnetic field increases .",
    "we also determined @xmath35 for profiles averaged with a @xmath13 resolution . this spatial averaging",
    "markedly affected the @xmath0-profile amplitudes and consequently the magnetic ratio ( fig .",
    "3b ) ; the @xmath35 scatter increased in every interval and the correlation between @xmath35 and profile amplitude deteriorated .",
    "the number of atypically shaped profiles ( with one wing or with several wings ) was found to grow among weaker @xmath0 profiles , and this can affect the accuracy with which mean @xmath0-profile amplitudes are calculated . it should be noted that the fe  i lines @xmath20 524.71 and 525.02  nm have very narrow profiles which are highly sensitive to temperature , so that the effect of extreme asymmetry of weak @xmath0 profiles is stronger for these lines , and this accounts for the greater scatter in @xmath35 for small @xmath0-profile amplitudes .",
    "we calculated the @xmath35 values in order to transform the magnetic ratios into field strengths .",
    "this was done with the data for the mhd model shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we calculated @xmath35 and effective heights of @xmath0-profile peak formation for each model column .",
    "having found the level at which the method locates the magnetic field , we determined the field strength for this level directly from the model and plotted the @xmath35@xmath41 relation ( fig .",
    "we found from this relation that a decrease of @xmath35 from 0.94 to 0.82 ( fig .",
    "3a ) corresponds to a growth of @xmath41 from 30 to 62  mt ( fig .",
    "this means that , according to the        line - ratio method , the field strength in the simulation region can be @xmath42  mt at the most , i.e. , the method did not fix any strong fields about 150  mt appropriate for the mhd models we use .",
    "the averaged magnetic line ratio is @xmath43 , and the corresponding mean field strength in the simulation region is 43 mt , in good agreement with the simulation results for our mhd model sequence ( 4050  mt ) and with the results obtained in @xcite by the line - ratio method applied to the @xmath0 profiles of the same two lines observed in quiet regions with high spatial resolution .",
    "no significant deviations of @xmath35 from unity were found in @xcite , and the intra - network fields were concluded to have no kilogauss structures ; the typical field strength was estimated at 2050  mt .",
    "the coincidence of the data from @xcite with the mean field strength in the mhd  models we used allows us to suggest that our simulation region is similar to quiet solar regions .",
    "thus , the testing of mhd models by the line - ratio method with the use of the fe  i lines @xmath44  524.71 and 525.02  nm showed a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and observed magnetic ratios as functions of the distance from the @xmath0-profile center .",
    "this suggests that the mhd models @xcite describe adequately the fine structure of actual magnetic fields of the quiet sun .",
    "the testing also demonstrated that fields stronger than 100  mt with filling factors of 15 percent can not be detected by the line - ratio method in quiet regions on the sun , since this method depends on spatial resolution . nevertheless , the method can give a reliable estimate for the mean field strength in quiet regions .",
    "the stokes profiles of the fe  i line @xmath9 630.25  nm were calculated for every column in the mhd models by integrating the unno - rachkovskii equations for the polarized radiation transfer in the lte approximation @xcite .",
    "we chose this moderately strong photospheric line for the @xmath0-profile analysis because it is most often used , together with the fe  i line @xmath9 630.15 nm , in polarimetric measurements @xcite . a telluric o@xmath45 line which is observed in the @xmath24-profile wing",
    "does not affect the @xmath0 profile .",
    "the line @xmath9 630.25  nm is preferred to the magnetic fe  i lines @xmath20 524.7 and 520.5  nm not only because of its unblended @xmath0 profile but also due to its high sensitivity to magnetic field and much smaller sensitivity to temperature irregularities .",
    "the @xmath0 profile of fe  i @xmath9 630.25  nm is formed rather deep in the photosphere , at the level @xmath46 , on the average , and thus it can be calculated in the lte approximation .",
    "it should be stressed that the dynamical characteristics of magnetic elements studied with the use of this line refer to the same photospheric level .",
    "this is particularly true for the velocity and magnetic field gradients which can suddenly change in highly inhomogeneous media , for example , at the periphery of compact magnetic features .",
    "that is why the asymmetry magnitude and sign , which attest to the existence of gradients , as well as the relationship between the asymmetry and other parameters found in our study can differ from the results obtained with the use of other lines .",
    "we compared our calculations to the fts observation data kindly made available by j.  stenflo and s.  solanki .",
    "these observations were made in quiet network elements and in active facula regions at the mcmath telescope in 1979 ; the fourier spectrograph had a high spectral resolution ( 420 000 ) and low spatial and time resolutions ( @xmath10 and 3552 min , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "we used only the @xmath0 profiles of fe  i and fe  ii lines in the wavelength range from 445.0 to 557.0  nm .",
    "the observed @xmath0 profile parameters were calculated by solanki s codes , and the absolute zero - crossing shifts were determined by the method proposed in @xcite .",

    "the areas @xmath54 and @xmath55 were obtained by integrating the @xmath56 profile from zero - crossing to a 0.5-percent level in the red and blue wings .    by analogy with the observation data from @xcite",
    ", we used only the profiles with amplitudes greater than 0.15 percent and regularly shaped profiles , i.e. , only those with two wings of different signs and with one zero - crossing .",
    "the number of such profiles was 3755 ; the rest were either very weak or abnormal in shape ( symmetric , with one wing only , or with several zero - crossings ) , and they were excluded from the analysis .    * mean @xmath0-profile amplitudes*. figure 4 ( upper part ) demonstrates the @xmath57 distribution obtained from @xmath0-profiles calculated without spatial averaging and with a @xmath13 averaging . when the histogram for all profiles is compared to the histogram for regularly shaped profiles ( without strong anomalies ) , one can see that weak profiles are less numerous in the second case due to highly asymmetry of weak profiles .",
    "spatial averaging of profiles essentially changes their distribution . recall that the maximum diameter of simulated flux tubes is about 350  km , so that the profiles averaged over a 700-km area do not resolve the tube structure , and profiles with amplitudes above 10 percent are absent in the histogram .",

    "6a shows obtained vertical velocities as functions of time .",
    "we also calculated the power spectrum of velocity oscillations ( fig .",
    "7a ) , where two power peaks can be clearly seen in the bands at 5  min ( @xmath74  mhz ) and 3 min ( @xmath75  mhz ) .",
    "the power maximum lies at @xmath76 mhz ( 5.9 min ) , and a smaller peak lies at @xmath77  mhz ( 3.5 min ) . a 99-percent confidence level shown by a horizontal line in the figure",
    "was calculated in accordance with @xcite from the mean power in the band 5.58.3 mhz .",
    "the nyquist frequency is equal to 8.3 mhz .",
    "velocity oscillations with frequencies of 2.57 , 3.88 , and 5.58 mhz were also obtained in @xcite from a 3-d simulation of the solar surface convection in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the p - mode oscillations were assumed to be excited by random nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations near the sun s surface .",
    "such fluctuations are produced by the radiative cooling which can locally deviate for a short time from equilibrium with the heating produced by convective motions .",
    "figure 6a shows the gas pressure fluctuations @xmath78 calculated for our models . here @xmath79 is the pressure averaged over one model at a specific point in time and <",
    "@xmath79 > is the pressure averaged over all models in a time interval of 120 min .",
    "comparison of the velocity and pressure oscillations suggests that there should be a relationship between them . in the power spectrum calculated for pressure oscillations ( fig .",
    "7b ) there are power peaks at the same frequencies as in the spectrum of velocity oscillations in the 5-min and 3-min bands .",
    "to examine the influence of magnetic field on the oscillations of vertical velocities , we obtained the field strength fluctuations @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "6b ) from the simulation data and calculated their power spectrum ( fig .",
    "first of all we point out a constant increase of the magnetic field and its well - marked oscillations associated with the evolution and disruption of strong flux tubes in the simulation region .",
    "a strong peak in the field strength oscillation power was found at @xmath81  mhz ( 20 min ) and a smaller peak was found at 1.25 mhz ( 13 min ) .",
    "when comparing the magnetic field oscillations with vertical velocity oscillations , we found that the negative velocity component almost disappeared and the positive component increased when the magnetic field was stronger , that is , the upflows were slower and downflows faster .",
    "this means that the velocity oscillations are nonlinear .",
    "such quasi - oscillatory motions in flux tubes were predicted in @xcite .",
    "nonlinear oscillations were considered there to be a superposition of upflows and downflows with different amplitudes and durations .",
    "the upflow velocities were estimated there at @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 and downflow velocities at about 2  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our results for the moments of magnetic field strengthening are very close to these data . as seen in fig .",
    "6a , the magnetic field modulates the velocity oscillations .",
    "based on the results of mhd simulation @xcite , we attribute this effect to convective instability in intergranular lanes . about 1012 min after the formation of a strong flux tube begins , conditions favorable for convective collapse set up , and the collapse produces a kilogauss field .",
    "then the flux tube is in a quasi - stable state for some time ( @xmath82  min ) , it is narrower and closer to the vertical , its temperature grows , the field is stronger , and the wilson depression correlates with the vertical velocity .",
    "oscillatory downward motions become more intense in the flux tube region . after each abrupt downward shift of magnetic configuration , there comes a period of a slacker convective collapse .",
    "these oscillations persist until the strong evacuation in the upper part of the flux tube begins to destroy the tube ( i.e. , until the beginning of reverse convective collapse ) . as this takes place ,",
    "downflows are replaced by upflows with supersonic velocities .",
    "the flux tube rapidly dissipates in the course of several minutes .",
    "the size and the inclination of the flux tube increase , the magnetic field and the temperature diminish , the wilson depression also diminishes . as the dynamical condition changes",
    ", the inclination of flux tubes also changes with time  it oscillates .",
    "this can give rise to waves propagating along the flux tubes @xcite .",
    "so , the convective and superconvective instability processes going in strong flux tubes bring about a  nonlinearity in the oscillatory motions of magnetized plasmas in the simulation region .     and area asymmetry @xmath83 of @xmath0 profiles , scatter of asymmetry parameters and their correlations : upper plots ) all profiles , lower plots ) profiles averaged with a 700-km step .",

    "the amplitude asymmetry varies in a wide range ( @xmath85  percent ) at small amplitudes .",
    "the area asymmetry has a similar distribution , but the scatter is smaller .",
    "the amplitude asymmetry correlates with the area asymmetry , at positive values they vary in nearly direct proportion .",
    "this means that both asymmetries are caused by the same factors  the velocity field and magnetic field gradients .",
    "mean asymmetries are close to zero ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 percent for unaveraged profiles and @xmath88 , @xmath89 percent for averaged ones ) .",
    "spatial averaging drastically weakens the correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath83 and changes the inclination of the relation  the amplitude asymmetry becomes more positive .",
    "this suggests that the spatial averaging is also a cause of observed profile asymmetry , the amplitude asymmetry being more sensitive to the averaging .",
    "this may be the reason why the amplitude asymmetry measured from observations is greater , as a rule , than the area asymmetry : @xmath90 percent and @xmath91 and 4 percent for the fe  i lines @xmath20  630.15 and 630.25  nm @xcite .",
    "figure 8 also shows the asymmetries found in fts observations @xcite , they are much greater , on the average , than those obtained in our calculations .",

    "this difference is yet to be explained .",
    "our results suggest that it is caused by insufficient spatial resolution of observations and by atmospheric effects .",
    "when the quality of observations and the spatial resolution are upgraded , the relative number of strong @xmath0 profiles observed in the kilogauss flux tube will increase .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the asymmetry in such profiles is much smaller because there are no sudden velocity and field strength gradients inside flux tubes as compared to their periphery or the regions of weak turbulence fields of mixed polarity",
    ". these properties of strong @xmath0 profiles also account for a small scatter in their asymmetries , while the scatter for weak @xmath0 profiles can be as large as 70 percent .",
    "we analyzed the relationship between the @xmath0-profile asymmetry and the amplitude @xmath57 , velocity @xmath67 , inclination angle @xmath61 , and contrast ( fig .",
    "the correlation of @xmath84 with these parameters is rather weak ; the only feature worthy of notice is an appreciable growth of positive asymmetry with the velocity of upflows while downflows are more often associated with negative amplitude asymmetries .",
    "* center - to - limb variation . *",
    "investigations of the center - to - limb variations in the @xmath0-profile shifts and asymmetries involve a huge amount of calculations , and so we selected ten snapshots only .",
    "figure 10 shows the velocity @xmath67 as functions of their position on the disk ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "@xmath67 is positive ( predominance of downflows ) outside the disk center , it amounts up to 2 km  s@xmath1 , on the average , at @xmath93 and changes almost not at all to the limb .        spatial averaging slightly affects the @xmath67@xmath94 dependence . according to observations @xcite , downflows dominate at the disk center , and the profile shifts are close to zero at the limb .",
    "our results can differ from observations for various reasons .",
    "we suppose that the velocity increase obtained in our calculations is a result of the canopy effect in the upper parts of flux tubes , where the profiles calculated for @xmath95 are formed .",
    "according to the 2d mhd simulations used in this paper , the strong flows of matter in the upper layers are predominantly inclined , they are directed slightly downwards , to the centers of intergranular lanes ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "another reason for the discrepancy can be related to some peculiarities of the 2d mhd models  the upper boundary conditions imposed on the upper layers in the models do not correspond to actual conditions in the upper photosphere .",
    "this may affect the calculations of the line profiles far from the disk center , these profiles being formed higher in the photosphere than those which are located closer to the disk center . at the same time",
    "the accuracy of observations deteriorates closer to the limb .",
    "it should also be noted that there is observational evidence of high horizontal velocities ( up to 2  km  s@xmath1 ) @xcite , and they are in better accord with our results .",
    "the center - to - limb variations of mean asymmetry @xmath84 , particularly the asymmetry for averaged profiles , agree satisfactorily with observation data . in fts observations @xcite the amplitude asymmetry diminished from 1015 percent at the disk center to zero at the limb .",
    "in @xcite the mean asymmetry @xmath84 varied from 15 percent ( center ) to @xmath96 percent ( limb ) , with the intersection point near @xmath97 .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite , but @xmath84 and @xmath83 slightly increased at @xmath98 and then monotonically diminished to the limb .",
    "the area asymmetry in our calculations is small and predominantly negative ( fig .",
    "10 ) , while in the fts observations in @xcite the asymmetry is positive at the center , diminishes to the limb and becomes negative .",
    "negative area asymmetries were observed in @xcite at the disk center in regions with small filling factor .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "10 that the spatial averaging of profiles affected the most the amplitude asymmetry , especially at the disk center .",
    "we wish to stress once more that the amplitude asymmetry is the parameter most sensitive to spatial averaging .",
    "we used the results of two - dimensional mhd simulation of solar granulation to investigate the motions of matter in magnetic elements with high spatial resolution ( 35  km ) .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0 profiles of the fe  i @xmath9 630.25  nm line synthesized in snapshots of the mhd simulations allowed us to make some inferences as to the vertical velocity of magnetized plasma motions in photospheric regions with a mean magnetic flux density of 0.2  mt and mean unsigned field strength of 35  mt .",
    "the mean velocity is @xmath99  km  s@xmath1 with a scatter from @xmath69 to 9  km  s@xmath1 . downflows with a mean velocity of @xmath100  km  s@xmath1 dominate in intergranular regions inside strong vertical flux tubes , while upflows with a mean velocity of @xmath99  km  s@xmath1 are typical of granular regions outside flux tubes .",
    "there is a noticeable correlation between the velocity and the amplitude and area asymmetries of @xmath0 profiles .",
    "the positive asymmetry increases , on the average , with upflow velocity .",
    "the negative asymmetry occurs most often in the profiles formed at the sites with dominant downflows .",
    "the mean asymmetry of amplitudes and areas is about 1 percent with a scatter of 70 percent in weak @xmath0 profiles and 10 percent in strong ones .",
    "the mean velocity fluctuates nonlinearly in time .",
    "there are two peaks in the velocity power spectrum  a stronger peak in the 5-min band and a much weaker one in the 3-min band .",
    "velocity fluctuations correlate with gas pressure fluctuations at the surface level , and they also depend on magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "the power spectrum of field strength fluctuations has two peaks at periods of 20 and 13 min .",
    "periodic variations of magnetic field strength are related to intensification and dissipation of magnetic fields in strong flux tubes . when the field strength increases , oscillatory downward motions are intensified , and this results in a nonlinearity of mean velocity oscillations .",
    "the mean velocity substantially changes when going from the solar disk center to the limb .",
    "these changes occur due to intense slopping motions in the upper layers of simulation region .",
    "the mean velocity increases to 2  km  s@xmath1 at a small distance from the disk center ( @xmath101 ) , and then it slightly changes to the limb .",
    "the amplitude asymmetry decreases and changes its sign from positive to negative when going from the center to the limb of the solar disk .",
    "the negative area asymmetry is greater at the limb .",
    "the mean velocity depends on spatial averaging of profiles . at lower resolutions",
    "the @xmath0-profile amplitudes and other parameters substantially change , and they are closer to the observed parameters . the asymmetry of @xmath0 profiles is the parameter most sensitive to spatial averaging , the amplitude asymmetry growing much faster at lower resolutions than the area asymmetry .",
    "this may be a reason why observed amplitude asymmetries are greater than area asymmetries .",
