    "in collisions of relativistic heavy nuclei , there is a substantially enhanced production of strange hadronic particles@xcite .",
    "since the time scale in a typical nucleus - nucleus collision is very short , it is necessary to determine kinetically the strange particle production @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of kinetic strangeness production suggest that abundant strangeness is either a signature of qgp or of some other new phase , e.g. , with partially restored chiral symmetry @xcite in which the cross section for strangeness production is considerably enhanced .",
    "enhancement in the total strangeness abundance tells us that we deal with a state of matter which is either dense or relatively long - lived or in which strangeness production cross sections are enhanced or possesses some combination of these three factors . in order to be more specific about the nature of the dense matter , individual strange quark and anti - quark clusters , which may be more sensitive to the environment from which they emerge @xcite , have to be considered .",
    "recent measurements of the abundance of strange anti - baryons and baryons at 200 gev a collisions of s - ions with a w - target by the wa85 collaboration @xciteconstrains the properties of the central rapidity source of these particles and it has already been demonstrated that the particle abundances are well in agreement with a picture of explosively disintegrating qgp fireball @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has been already argued that these results are compatible with the scenario of an equilibrium hg fireball @xcite . given",
    "that both approaches ( hg and qgp fireballs ) can account for the presented data , our main objective here will be to identify a difference between qgp and hg scenarios which permits to distinguish the underlying strangeness source despite the limited information available today .",
    "we note that on theoretical grounds the qgp interpretation is a more palatable one in view of the domain of the thermal parameters associated with the fireball .",
    "a simple distinction of these two phases derives from the inherent difference with regard to their entropy content @xmath1 given a fixed and conserved property , such as baryon number content @xmath2 which can be determined experimentally .",
    "@xmath2 is seen as being well understood in terms of the nucleon number of the combined system of the projectile nucleus and the target tube of nuclear matter cut out in the collision from the much larger target nucleus .",
    "baryon number of the fireball can decrease only by particle radiation in the final disintegration of the fireball , beyond which we assume that the scattering between the different components have ceased and the relative abundances carry the information about the property of the source . on the other hand , once the pre - equilibrium reactions have been terminated , and the particle momentum distributions have reached their thermal form , entropy production effectively has ceased , even if a phase transition occurs from a primordial phase to the final hg state @xcite .",
    "hence both baryon number and entropy content of the isolated fireball remain constant and their ratio in a theoretical description is rather model independent",
    ". therefore the supplementary measurement , which will permit to define the properties of this source is the multiplicity per participating baryon in the fireball which is directly related to entropy .",
    "while the hadronization of the entropy rich qgp fireball is presently not understood , we take advantage here of the fact that in any case a substantially enhanced particle multiplicity must result , as compared to the hg scenario .",
    "this can e.g arise if the qgp fireball were to evaporate emitting hadronic particles sequentially .",
    "in contrast to fireball entropy , the thermal fraction of energy of the fireball is decreasing in the course of fireball evolution even though the total energy content is conserved ; it can not be therefore used for the study of the properties of the source on a model independent way .",
    "implicit in the physical picture developed here is the formation of a central and hot matter fireball in the nuclear collisions at 200 gev a.this reaction picture does not necessarily imply `` full stopping '' of either baryon number or energy when the smaller projectile collides at small impact parameter with the target , actually effectively with the tube of matter in its path in the target nucleus .",
    "all that such a picture presumes is that the energy and flavor content of the central rapidity region is able to scatter several times , leading to thermal particle spectra in @xmath3 .",
    "support for such source of strange particles comes from the remarkably central production of strange particles as reported by the na35 collaboration @xcite even for s  s collisions and more recently by the na36 experiment @xcite for s @xmath0 pb . all these and other data @xcite can be combined to show that the source of transversely produced particles has a common apparent temperature of @xmath4 mev @xcite .",
    "the statistical variables of the system are the temperature @xmath5 and the chemical potentials @xmath6 of the different conserved quark flavors @xmath7 .",
    "it is convenient to denote : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is `` quark '' chemical potential , @xmath10 is the baryo - chemical potential and @xmath11 describes the ( small ) asymmetry in the number of up and down quarks due to the neutron excess in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is straightforward to identify that the ratio of the number of down and up quarks in a s @xmath0 w - tube collisions is 1.09 , and this number will help fix the small value of @xmath11 , in dependence on the assumed structure of the source  in any case this asymmetry leads to small corrections in our work and though implemented , will be not discussed at length .",
    "we further introduce the fugacities @xmath12 which are the tools of counting the particles .",
    "finally we note that it is not necessary to introduce different fugacities ( and chemical potentials ) for the hadronic gas phase , as the fugacity of each hg species is simply the product of the fugacities of the constituent quarks , viz .",
    "@xmath13 , etc .",
    "the fact that quark flavors @xmath7 are separately conserved on the scale of times of the hadronic collisions implies that their number is conserved and the production ( or annihilation ) can only occur in @xmath14 . in consequence the chemical potentials for particle and",
    "anti - particle flavors are opposite to each other and this implies @xmath15 .    in any statistical model for the production of particles based on a thermal source the ( relative ) probability of ( formation ) emission of a(composite )",
    "particle ( ignoring correlation effects ) is : @xmath16 for a composite particle at energy @xmath17 , eq.[eq7 ] becomes simply a phase space factor times the boltzmann exponential @xmath18 factor .",
    "we recall that @xmath19 with @xmath20 ( the transverse direction is with regard to the original collision axis ) and @xmath21 is the particle rapidity .",
    "the other factors in eq.[eq7 ] are : + a ) the statistical multiplicity factors @xmath22 , referring to the degeneracy of the @xmath23 component , and characterizing also the likelihood of finding among randomly assembled quarks , the suitable spin - isospin of the particle ; + b ) the product of chemical fugacities @xmath24 for each constituent quark species ; + c ) allowance is made for the approach to the absolute chemical equilibrium by strange quarks with a factor @xmath25 , for the strange quark flavor content of the particle .    as the method of measurement distinguishes the flavor content",
    ", we keep explicit the product of @xmath24-factors ; @xmath26 will enter when one compares particles with different number of strange quarks and/or anti - quarks .",
    "the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is that @xmath26 is the same for _ both _ @xmath28 and @xmath29 viz .",
    "@xmath30 , as both particles are produced together and hence their total abundance is equally distant from ` full ' phase space .",
    "we assume that for light flavors the @xmath31-factor is effectively unity considering the collision times and the strength hadronic cross sections .",
    "we note that this counting rule allows to describe the relative abundances of strange baryons and anti - baryons at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "all baryons considered here have spin @xmath32 , but they include spin @xmath33 resonances which become spin @xmath32 states through hadronic decays .",
    "this is implicitly contained in the counting of the particles by taking the product of the quark spin degeneracies ; since in all ratios to be considered this factor is the same , we shall not discuss it further .",
    "when considering hyperons we must remember that there are two different charge zero states of different isospin @xmath34 and @xmath35 : the experimental abundances of @xmath34 and @xmath36 ( i=0 ) implicitly include , respectively , the abundance of @xmath35 and @xmath37 ( i=1 , i@xmath38=0 ) , arising from the decay @xmath39 mev ) ; hence the true abundances must be corrected by a factor @xmath40 , e.g. @xmath41 , the latter being the observed quantity .",
    "comparing _ spectra _ of particles within overlapping regions of @xmath3 , the boltzmann and many statistical factors cancel , and their respective abundances are only functions of fugacities , e.g. : @xmath42 the cascade and lambda ratios can easily be related to each other , in a way which shows explicitly the chemical potential dependence : @xmath43 always remember that eq.[r2 ] is generally valid , irrespective of the state of the system ( hg or qgp ) . since the asymmetry @xmath11 is small ( see below ) , eq.[r2 ] determines the value of the baryo - chemical and strange potentials to considerable precision ( because of the factor 6 in the exponents ) .",
    "the value emerging from such an analysis will correspond to the conditions prevailing in the source of the strange ( anti- ) baryons .    in eq.[ratio ] above the factor @xmath44 did not appear because it is the same for both strange quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "it enters where particles of differing strangeness content are compared : @xmath45 the product of both expressions in eq.[rab2 ] determines the unknown quantity @xmath26 : @xmath46 the factor @xmath26 accounts for much of our ignorance about the dynamics of strangeness formation and the approach to equilibrium of the strange quark abundance .",
    "a value @xmath47 is believed to favor qgp interpretation of the data @xcite .",
    "we now recall the high @xmath3 , central @xmath21 strange anti - baryon abundances emerging from high energy nuclear collisions of 200  gev / as @xmath0 w. the following data is from the cern experiment wa85 @xcite , and we have : @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 gev / c . in p - w reactions in the same @xmath51 region , a smaller value @xmath52 is found .",
    "furthermore , @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath50 gev / c . here",
    "corrections were applied to eliminate hyperons from cascading decays .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 for s - w collisions is slightly smaller than for p - w collisions in the same kinematic range .",
    "wa85 also determined @xmath56 and @xmath57 at fixed @xmath58 gev .",
    "the fact that the more massive and more strange anti - cascade exceeds at fixed @xmath3 the abundance of the anti - lambda is most striking , even considering the experimental error .",
    "these results are inexplicable presently in terms of particle cascades @xcite .",
    "the relative yield of @xmath59 appears to be 5 times greater than seen in the @xmath60 isr experiment @xcite at higher energy .",
    "these results imply in view of eq.[rab3 ] : @xmath61  the source is near to absolute chemical equilibrium of strangeness .",
    "note that the error which comprises only the experimental measurement error comes out amazingly small for @xmath26 , considering how large the error on the individual quantities has been .",
    "the values of the chemical potentials are determined by the two forms of the eq.[r2 ] . neglecting the isospin asymmetry factor , we find : @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 vanishes within the precision of the measurements , which indicates exact symmetry between the produced strange and anti - strange quarks , which can only occur in either :    1 .   a baryon number free fireball of arbitrary composition  this is clearly excluded by the presence of a finite @xmath9 ; 2 .   in a qgp phase before hadronization ; 3 .   in a hg at the magic point in @xmath65 parameter space for which the size of the phase space for strange and anti - strange baryons _ accidentally _ agree .",
    "the qgp interpretation of the conditions determined above is natural : in qgp we always have @xmath66 for a fireball with zero strangeness .",
    "this implies that we implicitly assume that the loss of strangeness due to pre - equilibrium emission is small and/or symmetric between @xmath28 and @xmath29-quarks .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( allowing for the asymmetry between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 quarks ) we find for the value of @xmath71 and @xmath72 mev that the energy density is 2.2 gev/@xmath73 , baryon density 0.27/@xmath73 , above normal nuclear density and the strange quark density is 0.45/@xmath73 ( allowing for the factor @xmath74 as determined ) .",
    "the entropy per baryon is @xmath75 and it rises slowly to 47.1 as temperature is increased by 20 mev .",
    "naturally , strangeness density scales nearly with @xmath76 , while the energy density scales nearly with @xmath77 . a non - negligible portion of the energy is contained in the strange quark pair density .",
    "a further small component is in the latent energy of the vacuum which we took here to be @xmath78 mev@xmath79 .",
    "we note that while presence of @xmath80 reduces the light quark and gluon effective degrees of freedom according to the known first order perturbative behavior , we have left the contributions of strange quarks to entropy , energy , etc ... unaffected by the perturbative qcd interaction .",
    "when the value of @xmath80 is changed by @xmath81 there is a small change in the entropy per baryon : for @xmath82 we find the value @xmath83 , for @xmath84 we find @xmath85 .",
    "as noted before , in principle entropy must increase in the evolution of the qgp fireball , and in practice this increase is small once thermal conditions are reached .",
    "the entropy content per baryon is ultimately contained in the particle multiplicity that emerges in the central rapidity region , mostly in form of pions . as each baryon in a non - relativistic nucleon gas has the entropy content @xmath86 the remaining entropy , @xmath87 is divided between the pions : in a relativistic pion gas at @xmath88 we have entropy content per particle @xmath89 .",
    "consequently we find that the thermal parameters of the qgp fireball would lead to a hadronic particle multiplicity per participating baryon which must be above @xmath90 with the uncertainty in the value of @xmath80 introducing an uncertainty of one unit in this value .",
    "as expected , the qgp picture thus leads to a relatively high final state multiplicity .",
    "we now turn to discuss the possibility that the single data point we have for @xmath91 is associated with a hadronic gas fireball .",
    "it is easy to write in the boltzmann approximation the partition function for the strange particle fraction of the hadronic gas , @xmath92 , as it has been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , given the wa85 values of the thermal parameters we are obliged to sum over many more strange hadronic particles than was done in eq.4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have in detail : @xmath93 \\label{4a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kaon ( @xmath94 ) , hyperon ( @xmath95 ) , cascade ( @xmath96 ) and omega ( @xmath97 ) degrees of freedom in the hadronic gas are included successively .",
    "the phase space factors @xmath98 of the strange particles are : @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the modified bessel function .",
    "we now consider a hg fireball in which the number of @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks is equal .",
    "the condition that the total strangeness vanishes takes the form @xmath102 this is an implicit equation relating @xmath103 with @xmath104 for each given @xmath5 . in actual calculations we have distinguished the @xmath105 quarks and introduced as required @xmath106 in lieu of @xmath104 , with the ratio of @xmath107 determined by the requirement that the ratio of down to up flavor is 1.09 ( at temperature @xmath108 mev this leads to @xmath109 ) . in order to implement this requirement we of course had to include in the partition function the non - strange hadrons , which was done in the same way , with the mesons included up to mass 1690 mev , nucleons up to 1675 mev and @xmath110 s up to 1900 mev",
    "we note that higher resonances would matter only if their number were divergent as is the case in the bootstrap approach of hagedorn @xcite and the hg was sufficiently long lived to populate all high mass resonances .",
    "we caution the reader that our empirical approach suffers as soon as we ask questions which are dependent either on the ever increasing mass spectrum of particles or on the proper volume occupied by the particles @xcite .",
    "however , quantities such as condition of zero strangeness , fixed entropy per baryon are independent of the absolute normalization of the volume and of the renormalization introduced by the diverging spectrum and hence can be considered in the approach we take .    in the @xmath111 plane",
    "the condition of zero strangeness combined with the condition @xmath112 leads to the curve shown in fig.1 by the solid line .",
    "dashed line is the case @xmath113 and dotted line @xmath114 .",
    "the upper and lower boundary of hatched area arise from @xmath115 and from the constraint obtained from the @xmath116 ratio .",
    "we find that if we are willing to accept a hadronic gas @xcite at temperature of @xmath117 mev , it could indeed be the source of strange particles  another puzzle in such an interpretation is the condition of @xmath118 which is natural for qgp , and does not have at present any special founding for the hg state .",
    "however , we find that the properties of the hg and qgp fireballs are considerably different in particular with regard to the entropy content .",
    "both states are easily distinguishable in the regime of values @xmath119 shown in fig.1 .",
    "we find for @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , the pion multiplicity which can be expected from such a hg fireball is @xmath121 .",
    "this is less than half of the qgp based expectations we found above , and clearly the difference is considerable in terms of experimental sensitivity .",
    "checking the theoretical sensitivity we find that the point at which the entropy of hg and qgp coincide _ and _ strangeness vanishes _ and _ @xmath122 is at @xmath123 mev , @xmath124 mev , quite different from the region of interest here .",
    "we note that charged particle multiplicity _ above 600 _ in the central region has been seen @xcite in heavy ion collisions corresponding possibly to a total particle multiplicity of about 1,000 , as required in the qgp scenario for the central fireball we described above .",
    "we thus conclude that the different models for the source of the strange particles in s @xmath0 w 200 gev collisions can be differentiated with help of the entropy content which corresponds to the final particle multiplicity .",
    "particle multiplicity per baryon of about 10 indicates pure qgp fireball , around 4 suggests pure hg , and an intermediate value may be taken to be indicative of a mixed and/or pre - critical phase .",
    "we recall that the number of baryons in a zero impact parameter collision is about 110 , and that in the above discussion multiplicity of strange particles is included ",
    "strangeness being a non - negligible component in the particle flow . while we can not distinguish alone in terms of strange particle high @xmath3 spectra the qgp and hg hypothesis for the case @xmath125 mev , we have shown assuming that the fireball has net strangeness zero , that in the extreme conditions considered here both hypothesis are falsifiable when studying the associated particle multiplicities .",
