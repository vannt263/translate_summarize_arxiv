    "ngc 4945 is a nearby ( 3.7 mpc : mauersberger et  al .",
    "1996 ) , edge - on spiral galaxy in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it is the third brightest galaxy in the iras point source catalogue , and most of its infrared emission arises in a compact central region ( rice et  al .",
    "1988 ; brock et  al .",
    "ngc 4945 shows both starburst emission ( e.g. heckman , armus & miley 1990 ; koornneef 1993 ) and a highly obscured and variable seyfert core ( iwasawa et  al . 1993 ) .",
    "it has recently been discovered to be the brightest seyfert 2 known at high x - ray energies ( @xmath5 kev : done , madejski & smith 1996 ) . in this letter",
    "we report on a powerful , off - nuclear x - ray source in ngc 4945 that shows large - amplitude variability on a time - scale of a year .",
    "ngc 4945 was observed with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; tr \" umper 1983 ; pfeffermann et  al .",
    "1987 ) starting on 1992 august 12 ( rp600259 : total raw exposure of 14208 s over @xmath6 s ) and 1993 july 10 ( rp600275 : total raw exposure of 9032 s over 80760 s ) .",
    "these were the first observations of this galaxy with an imaging x - ray detector .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to rp600259 as ` pointing 1 ' or ` p1 ' and rp600275 as ` pointing 2 ' or ` p2 ' .",
    "the observations were performed in the standard ` wobble ' mode , and reduction and analysis of the pspc data were performed with the starlink asterix x - ray data processing system .",
    "ngc 4945 was also observed with ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) starting on 1993 august 31 ( total good sis exposure time of 35000 s over 68362 s ) , and the high resolution imager ( hri ) starting on 1994 july 11 ( rh600276 : total raw exposure of 8608 s over @xmath7 s ) .",
    "the data were reduced and analysed using the xselect x - ray data processing system , and the hri data were reduced and analysed with asterix .    in figure 1 we show contours of the p2 pspc hard image ( we use pspc channels 52201 which correspond to @xmath80.52.0 kev ) overlaid on the image from the uk schmidt southern sky survey j plate [ see section iib of lasker et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) for more information on the optical image ] .",
    "we also show the position of the nucleus ( we use the nuclear coordinates of henkel , whiteoak & mauersberger 1994 ) .",
    "the image shows several point sources as well as diffuse x - ray emission ( presumably associated with the starburst ) . we have used the asterix point source searching program pss ( allan 1995 ) to search the hard pspc image for point sources that are spatially coincident with the optical extent of ngc 4945 .",
    "we detect five point sources ( at greater than 5@xmath9 ) in both p1 and p2 .",
    "if we compare the count rates of these sources between p1 and p2 , four of them show little evidence for variability .",
    "however , the fifth stands out as showing clear evidence for having brightened between p1 and p2 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we have plotted the position of this source in figure 1 and shall hereafter refer to it as ngc 4945 x-1 .",
    "the p1 x - ray centroid position of x-1 is @xmath10 13@xmath11 05@xmath12 22.6@xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath1529@xmath1612@xmath17 , and its p2 x - ray centroid position is @xmath10 13@xmath11 05@xmath12 22.1@xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath1529@xmath1609@xmath17 .",
    "these positions each have absolute errors of about 15 arcsec and are entirely consistent with one another .",
    "x-1 is offset from the nucleus with extremely high statistical significance ( the separation is @xmath18 arcmin ) .",
    "we have checked the pspc image astrometry ( for both p1 and p2 ) using ngc 4945a , which lies close to ngc 4945 on the plane of the sky , and it appears to be good to within 15 arcsec .",
    "the pss count rate of x-1 during p1 is @xmath19 count s@xmath3 , and its pss count rate during p2 is @xmath20 count s@xmath3 ( we quote 68 per cent confidence count rate errors ) .",
    "the hard band count rate thus appears to have increased by a factor of @xmath21 in the 11 months between p1 and p2 .",
    "we note that , while small - scale gradients in the diffuse x - ray emission might lead to slightly larger errors than the formal pss errors stated above , they can not remove the large - amplitude variability that we detect .",
    "inspection by eye of the p1 and p2 images clearly shows that x-1 has brightened substantially . during p2 , x-1 is the brightest soft x - ray point source observable in ngc 4945 .",
    "the observation also detects a point x - ray source with a position that coincides with that of x-1 .",
    "we have used other sources in ngc 4945 seen by both and to improve the astrometry of the sis images .",
    "the x - ray centroid position for the source is @xmath10 13@xmath11 05@xmath12 22.9@xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath1529@xmath1617@xmath17 , and the error circle for this position is about 20 arcsec .",
    "the source is detected with very high statistical significance ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "precision source count rate determination is difficult , owing to the broader point spread function that leads to cross - source contamination . in order",
    "roughly to estimate the count rate , we have compared the relative peak heights of x-1 and a source located at @xmath10 13@xmath11 05@xmath12 31.9@xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath1527@xmath1633@xmath17 in the 0.62.0 kev image .",
    "the height of x-1 is larger than that of the comparison source by a factor of about 1.5 .",
    "provided that the comparison source is not variable we estimate an effective pspc count rate for x-1 of about @xmath23 count s@xmath3 by multiplying the pspc count rate of the comparison source by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "thus x-1 appears to have dimmed by a factor of about 2 in 52 days .",
    "we note that x-1 is not the brightest point source in the 0.62.0 kev image of ngc 4945 .",
    "we have also used pss to search the hri image for point sources . in this",
    "searching we use only hri channels 416 to avoid contamination by ultraviolet light ( cf .",
    "section 3.6 of david et  al .",
    "1995 ) . at the pspc position of x-1",
    "there is only a weak ( 1.8@xmath9 ) x - ray source with an hri count rate of @xmath24 count s@xmath3 .",
    "the hri count rate of x-1 is thus a factor of @xmath25 times lower than its p2 count rate .",
    "if we use pimms ( mukai 1995 ) and the pspc spectral models given below to take into account the different responses of the pspc and the hri , we find that the hri count rate of x-1 should have only been lower than its p2 count rate by a factor of 2.54.0 if x-1 remained constant .",
    "the hri - to - p2 count rate ratio of x-1 is much smaller than that for the other sources in ngc 4945 .",
    "thus x-1 appears to have dimmed by a factor of @xmath1 between 1993 july 10 and 1994 july 11 .",
    "count rates from should be averaged over an integer multiple of the 400-s wobble period when used to search for rapid variability of cosmic x - ray sources ( cf .",
    "brinkmann et  al .",
    "we have searched for rapid variability of x-1 during p1 and p2 and do not detect any such variability with high statistical significance . however , even during p2 the statistics are such that we would only be able to detect variability by factors @xmath26 . the data do not show any significant x-1 variability ( again variations by a factor of @xmath26 would be required for a detection ) , and the hri data do not allow a serious variability search .",
    "meaningful pspc spectral fitting of x-1 is not possible during p1 , and only crude spectral fitting is possible during p2 .",
    "cross - source contamination , the low total number of source counts , and the limited spectral resolution of the pspc all hinder precision fitting .",
    "however , in order to probe the spectrum of x-1 to the greatest extent possible and derive luminosity constraints , we have extracted source counts from a circular region of radius 0.8 arcmin centred on x-1 . in this region",
    "the emission from x-1 dominates the x - ray flux .",
    "while we recognize that we are losing some source counts as a result of our small extraction radius , any larger radius would introduce unacceptably large cross - source contamination .",
    "we do include the standard energy - dependent correction for source counts scattered outside our source region .",
    "we take our background from a circular region of radius 1 arcmin centred on @xmath10 13@xmath11 05@xmath12 10.8@xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath1531@xmath1626@xmath17 , as this region appears to have approximately the same level of background as the source region .",
    "we obtain @xmath27 counts for our spectrum after background subtraction .",
    "the galactic neutral hydrogen column towards ngc 4945 is @xmath28 @xmath29 ( heiles & cleary 1979 , page 51 ) , and we note that there may well be significant intrinsic column in the disc of ngc 4945 .",
    "after corrections for source region size , vignetting , wire scattering and detector dead time , we have binned our extracted spectrum so that there are at least 12 counts in each spectral bin ( this allows the use of chi - squared fitting techniques ) .",
    "we fit this spectrum using the xspec spectral fitting package .",
    "we fit only the data above 0.85 kev , as the lower energy data have potentially significant background and cross - source contamination ( by ignoring the data below 0.85 kev we lose only about 10 per cent of our source counts due to the large column ) .",
    "when we state fluxes below they are computed for the 0.852.5 kev band that we directly fit .",
    "all errors are for 90 per cent confidence , taking all free parameters to be of interest other than the absolute normalization .",
    "we first considered a power - law model with the only absorption being due to the galactic column .",
    "this model gives a flat power - law photon index of @xmath30 , @xmath31 for 12 degrees of freedom , an absorbed flux of @xmath32 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 , and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath33 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 .",
    "if we instead fix the photon index to be @xmath34 and allow the absorption column to be a free parameter , we obtain @xmath35 @xmath29 , @xmath36 for 12 degrees of freedom , an absorbed flux of @xmath37 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 , and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath38 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 .",
    "power - law models where we allow both the photon index and the absorption column to be free parameters are very poorly constrained , but give unabsorbed fluxes similar to or larger than those stated above .",
    "we have also fitted an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model to our spectrum ( see figure 3 ) . using this model we derive @xmath39 @xmath29 , @xmath40 kev ( @xmath41 is constrained to be larger than 0.5 kev ) , @xmath42 for 11 degrees of freedom , an absorbed flux of @xmath43 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 , and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath44 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 .",
    "if we fix the total column at the galactic value , a thermal bremsstrahlung model leaves large systematic residuals and can be ruled out with greater than 90 per cent confidence .",
    "the cross - source contamination does not allow a detailed spectral analysis , but we have performed a rough x - ray colour analysis using a small aperture ( a square with side length 1.2 arcmin ) to minimize cross - source contamination . the colour analysis used three energy bands : 0.71.3 kev , 1.32.3 kev and 2.38.0 kev .",
    "x-1 has the smallest 2.38.0 kev to 1.32.3 kev count rate ratio ( @xmath45 ) as well as the smallest 0.71.3 kev to 1.32.3 kev count rate ratio ( @xmath46 ) of any source in ngc 4945 .",
    "for a power - law model , the first ratio corresponds to a spectral slope of @xmath47 or steeper , and the second ratio corresponds to an absorption column of @xmath48 @xmath29 or more .",
    "this suggests that the galactic column power - law fit to the pspc data ( see above ) is probably not physically appropriate .",
    "a more detailed colour analysis of all the sources in ngc 4945 will be presented by iwasawa et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "it is unlikely that x-1 is a foreground or background x - ray source . given the position of ngc 4945 , the probability of finding a contaminating source with at least the p2 flux of x-1 within the optical extent of ngc 4945 is less than @xmath49 ( see section v of hertz & grindlay 1984 ) .",
    "we have searched the uk schmidt plate image and the less saturated image in sandage & bedke ( 1994 ) , and there are no obvious foreground optical counterparts .",
    "the position of x-1 in the nomograph of maccacaro et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) does not agree well with that of a foreground star ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "there is no strong x - ray variability during p2 as might be expected from a foreground flare star and , in addition , saw x-1 to be bright 52 days after p2 .",
    "furthermore , we note that the excess column over the galactic value suggested by our spectral analysis argues for the extragalactic nature of x-1 .",
    "as all of our models above yield unabsorbed fluxes larger than @xmath50 erg @xmath29 s@xmath3 , the isotropic luminosity of x-1 during p2 appears to be larger than @xmath51 erg s@xmath3 ( we use a conservative distance of 3.7 mpc ) .",
    "we note that there is probably some additional flux outside the 0.852.5 kev band considered above , and reasonable estimates of the total x - ray flux of x-1 suggest isotropic luminosities of @xmath4 erg s@xmath3 or more .",
    "there is no obvious radio source that corresponds to x-1 in the 843 mhz radio map of harnett & reynolds ( 1985 ) or the co maps of dahlem et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , although these limits are not tight ( e.g. the 843 mhz radio flux is less than 77 mjy with a @xmath52 arcsec@xmath53 beam ) . the large amplitude variability of x-1 allows us to rule out a starburst superbubble model for this source , and its off - nuclear position argues against a low luminosity active galactic nucleus .",
    "we are thus led to consider ultra - powerful x - ray binaries and supernova remnants .",
    "the minimum p2 isotropic luminosity for x-1 corresponds to the eddington limit luminosity for a 6 solar mass compact object , and makes it more luminous than any known persistent x - ray binary in the milky way .",
    "if x-1 is a binary , then the variability and the mass derived from the eddington limit are suggestive of a transient black hole binary , and we note that the peak observed isotropic luminosity of x-1 is similar to that for the galactic transient gs 2023 + 338 ( v404 cyg ; tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "however , we note that some rare neutron star binaries in the magellanic clouds have comparable isotropic luminosities to x-1 ( e.g. a@xmath54 in outburst ; smc x-1 in its bright state ) . of course",
    ", the emission need not be isotropic and indeed could be beamed ( see reynolds et  al .",
    "1996 for a more detailed discussion of this possibility ) .",
    "our x - ray spectrum is consistent to within its ( large ) errors with that seen from luminous galactic black hole binaries .",
    "ultra - powerful supernova remnants are described in schlegel ( 1995 ) and references therein . to explain x-1 a remnant",
    "would have had to brighten by a factor of about 9 in one year and then dim by a factor of @xmath1 in the subsequent year",
    ". this could perhaps happen if we caught a remnant either when it was very young or when it happened to be interacting with circumstellar material . by comparison with predictions for the x - ray emission from the ring around sn 1987a ( e.g. suzuki , shigeyama & nomoto 1992 ) , we note that very dense circumstellar material would be needed in the second scenario to explain the large luminosity and short cooling time",
    ". however , the required variability does not seem to be obviously inconsistent with our limited knowledge of the variability of other powerful supernova remnants ( schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "we have checked the updated version of the asiago supernova catalogue and the van den bergh supernova catalogue ( barbon , cappellaro & turatto 1989 ; van den bergh 1994 ) , and no supernovae in ngc 4945 are listed .",
    "ngc 4945 is regularly monitored for supernovae , and no supernovae brighter than 15.5 mag have been seen during the dates relevant to this paper ( rev .",
    "r. evans , private communication ; see chapter 5 of murdin 1990 ) . we note that the ` inclination effect ' is not likely to make the discovery of supernovae impossible in ngc 4945 ( see the discussion in van den bergh 1994 ) . in the case of only galactic extinction , the apparent magnitude limit corresponds to an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath55 . if we take into account the intrinsic extinction suggested by our x - ray spectral fitting ( see above ) , the absolute magnitude limit is reduced to about @xmath56 , although limit values as low as @xmath57 are not impossible . however",
    ", we note that if the extinction were as large as 7.1 magnitudes then even larger 0.852.5 kev luminosities of @xmath58 erg s@xmath3 or more would be implied .",
    "thus if x-1 were a supernova it probably , although not certainly , would have been seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "we have also checked the uk schmidt plate database for optical plates that might be used to look for a supernova , but unfortunately there are no plates at appropriate dates .",
    "additional _ asca _ , and observations of ngc 4945 are needed to monitor the variability of x-1 .",
    "the detection of another outburst or rapid x - ray variability would further support the binary interpretation .",
