    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite and @xcite give an empirical formula for the relationship between planet mass and the gap depth , which is derived analytically by considering the angular momentum exchange processes between the disk and the planet @xcite .",
    "we briefly explain a more accurate derivation given by k15 , below .",
    "we assume a steady , axisymmetric , non  self  gravitating , geometrically thin disk . in a viscous accretion disk , the radial angular momentum flux @xmath9",
    "is given by the combination of the fluxes carried by advection and viscosity @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote the radial distance from the central star , the angular velocity of the disk , the mass flux , the kinetic viscosity , and the surface density , respectively .",
    "adopting the @xmath2prescription of kinematic viscosity @xcite , we write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the disk aspect ratio and @xmath18 is the sound speed , which are dependent on the disk temperature .",
    "because of a strong gravitational torque exerted by a planet on the disk , a gap opens along the planet orbit .",
    "we assume a sufficiently wide gap so that the torque is exerted mainly within a flat gap bottom with a constant surface density @xmath19 .",
    "then , using the wkb torque formula with a cutoff , the one  sided lindblad torque , @xmath20 , which is exerted by the planet on the outer disk , is approximately given by ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath21 where @xmath0 and @xmath22 denotes the masses of the planet and the central star , respectively , and the subscript @xmath23 denotes the values at the planet orbital radius @xmath24 . in the above",
    ", we set the torque cutoff length @xmath25 to match the one  sided torque with the results by detailed linear analyses of disk ",
    "planet interaction @xcite .",
    "the above assumption that the planetary torque is exerted mainly within the gap can be valid when the gap width is much larger than the cutoff length .    in steady state , the mass flux is constant and the angular momentum flux radially changes due to the planetary torque .",
    "thus , the angular momentum flux at the outside of the gap , @xmath26 is equal to the sum of the angular momentum flux at @xmath24 and the one  sided torque @xmath20 , @xmath27 at the outside of the gap , the surface density is the unperturbed value @xmath28 .",
    "the gap width is much smaller than @xmath24 though the width is longer than the cutoff length",
    ". then we can set @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and therefor @xmath32 . under these approximations ,",
    "substitution of equations  ( [ eq : amf ] ) and ( [ eq : outerlb ] ) into ( [ eq : amf_planet ] ) yields @xmath33 from equation  ( [ eq : amf_balance ] ) , we obtain the gap depth @xmath34 , as @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( see k15 for detail derivation ) . although we adopt a simple expression for the one  sided torque , equation  ( [ eq : gap_depth ] ) gives a good agreement with the results of hydrodynamic simulations as shown in figure  [ fig : gapdepth ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : gap_depth ] ) would be valid for @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 is appreciably large , the gap even becomes eccentric and non  steady , which breaks down our simple estimate @xcite . in the eccentric state ,",
    "the gap is shallower than the prediction by equation ( [ eq : gap_depth ] ) @xcite .    as seen in equation ( [ eq : gap_depth ] )",
    ", it is related to the planet mass , the viscosity and the aspect ratio . solving equation ( [ eq : gap_depth ] ) for @xmath39",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 figure  [ fig : param_contour ] displays the planet mass given by equation  ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] ) as a function of the gap depth @xmath41 and the disk aspect ratio for several cases of @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of the planet mass on @xmath1 is strong , though @xmath2dependence is relatively weak .",
    "the planet mass varies from @xmath42 to @xmath43 if @xmath1 changes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the constraint on @xmath1 , or equivalently disk temperature , is important in estimating the planet mass . in current observations ,",
    "the constraints of the disk temperature can be given , for example , by emissions from optically thick gas ( or sometimes dust ) as discussed in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : spiralconstraint ] , we also show that the spiral structure can constrain the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio .    in application of our model to an observed gap",
    ", we assume that the distribution of dust is similar to the gas .",
    "because of the dust filtration accompanied with the gap , however , the dust distribution can be significantly deviated from the gas , as reported by many theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the millimeter ",
    "sized or larger dust particles strongly suffer the dust filtration .",
    "they are piled up at the outer edge of the gap and have a much deeper gap than the gas .",
    "smaller particles with radii of @xmath48 mm , on the other hand , are not much affected by the dust filtration and their distributions are similar to the gas for a gap created by a jupiter mass planet ( see figure  3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence the above assumption in our model is valid for the case of such small dust particles .",
    "also note that the critical dust size of filtration depends on the gas density and the turbulent viscosity .",
    "@xcite did not take into account an additional diffusion of dust particles by the turbulence due to the rossby wave instability and the rayleigh unstable region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which occur at a deep gap .",
    "this additional diffusion can further increase the critical dust size for filtration . in application to an observed gap , it is also important to judge whether the filtration effect strongly alters the dust distribution at the gap or not .",
    "such a judgement can be possible , by checking the dust pilling ",
    "up at the outer edge of the gap ( see section  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "in the actual observations of protoplanetary disks to date , there are several cases where the gap - like structures are observed . in this section ,",
    "we consider two examples : hl  tau and hd  169142 .",
    "hl  tau was observed during the 2014 long baseline campaign of alma @xcite .",
    "the observations show multiple rings but we focus on the ring residing at @xmath49  au , which is clearly seen and reasonably resolved .",
    "we use the fits image of the hl  tau that is publicly available from the alma archive site .",
    "we use the data of dust continuum emission in band 6 and 7 in our analyses , and assume the distance of @xmath50  pc .",
    "figure [ fig : prof_results](a ) and ( b ) show the radial profiles of the brightness temperature in band 6 and 7 between @xmath51 ",
    "@xmath52 averaged over the position angles of @xmath53 , which is close to the major axis of the disk .",
    "we use the position of the central brightest pixel as the location of the disk center .",
    "since the brightness temperatures in band 6 and 7 are similar at @xmath54 , the dust emission is likely to be optically thick .",
    "therefore , we use the ratio of the brightness temperature in the two bands to estimate the actual gap depth .",
    "the brightness temperatures in band 6 and 7 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the disk temperature , @xmath60 is the optical depth in band 6 and @xmath61 is that in band 7 .",
    "the optical depths of the band 6 and 7 are related by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the central frequency at band 6 , @xmath64 is that at band 7 , and @xmath65 is the opacity index .",
    "we can derive @xmath60 and @xmath59 by using equations ( [ eq : tau6 ] ) and ( [ eq : tau7 ] ) if we assume @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ fig : prof_results](c ) shows the radial profiles of @xmath66 in the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by measuring the contrast of the maximum of @xmath69 at @xmath70 and the minimum at @xmath71",
    ", we estimate the depth of the gap to be @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : prof_results](d ) also shows the profile of @xmath59 in the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath73 .",
    "the temperature in the gap region strongly depends on the assumption of @xmath65 , but that outside the gap is relatively insensitive to it .",
    "if we use @xmath74 at @xmath75 , and assume that the sound speed is @xmath76 and that the central star mass is @xmath77 , we derive @xmath78 as an estimate of the disk aspect ratio . adopting equation ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] ) , we derive @xmath79 if this gap is created by a planet .",
    "note that the error in the estimate of the stellar mass also increases the error in the planet - star mass - ratio through @xmath80 . in the above estimate",
    ", it is assumed that dust particles are gas have simular distributions .",
    "this assumption is vaild when dust particles are too samll to be much affected by the dust filtration , as mentioned in the end of section  [ sec : gapmodel ] .",
    "we can check the validity of the assumption , using the observed gap structure . according to the result by @xcite ,",
    "the dust surface density at the outer edge of the gap is much larger than that at the inner edge when the dust filtration is effective . for the gap at @xmath5",
    "au of hl  tau , on the other hand , the distribution of the dust optical depth ( see figure  [ fig : prof_results][c ] ) does not show any enhance at the outer edge . hence , we can judge that dust filtration is not so effective in this case .",
    "the second example is the disk around hd  169142 .",
    "recent observations by @xcite of 7  mm emission shows that there may exist a gap at @xmath81  au from the central star .",
    "the observations also found a knot at @xmath82  au , which could be regarded as compact source with the mass of @xmath83 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the gap depth from their observation since the beam size is relatively large , but the radial profile given in the figure  2 of @xcite suggests that the gap may be as shallow as @xmath84 .",
    "we consider this as the upper limit of the gap depth since the model with complete gap ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) seems to be consistent with observations .",
    "if we adopt the disk aspect ratio of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as indicated by @xcite , we obtain the lower limit of the planet mass as @xmath88 from equation ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the constraint on disk temperature , or disk aspect ratio , is important in inferring the planet mass from the gap structure . as discussed above",
    ", the disk temperature is obtained from the disk emissions . here , we discuss an alternative constraint on disk aspect ratio coming from a spiral density wave , which is a natural consequence of disk  planet interaction .",
    "the spiral structures have been observed in infrared observations so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect such features may be observed at sub  millimeter wavelengths in near future when better sensitivity at higher spatial resolution is available .    this shape of the spiral density wave induced by disk ",
    "planet interaction is related to the disk aspect ratio ( or temperature ) and is given in an analytic form  @xcite .",
    "the shape of spiral waves excited by a planet is determined by four parameters , @xmath89 and @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "[ 1 ] * ? ? ?",
    "the launching location of spiral waves ( very close to the planet location ) is denoted as ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 denotes the profile of sound speed @xmath92 .",
    "the disk aspect ratio @xmath93 changes as @xmath94 . for demonstration , we have performed two  dimensional hydrodynamic calculations using fargo  @xcite to obtain the gap and spiral structures caused by a jupiter mass planet at @xmath95 in a disk with @xmath47 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefit]-(a ) and ( b ) are the optically thin dust thermal emission at 230ghz obtained by the simulation ( @xmath98 is assumed to be @xmath99  @xmath100/g per unit gas mass and the dust and gas are assumed to be well  mixed ) , and the radial cuts of the emission along the wave and in the direction opposite to the planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefit]-(c ) and ( d ) are the same as ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , but the emission is convolved with a circular gaussian beam with an fwhm of 0.065  ( the distance to the disk is set as @xmath101 pc ) . even in the convoluted image , the emission of wave is about @xmath102 larger than the emission from non  wave region near the planet",
    ". such spiral feature would be detectable with future alma or tmt observations .",
    "we fit the spiral structure , and the resulting @xmath103map ( figure  [ fig : paramfit ] ) indicates that we can constrain the lower limit of @xmath1 to be @xmath104 .",
    "the gap depth can be estimated by @xmath105 from figure  [ fig : wavefit ] .",
    "therefore , from equation ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] ) , we derive the lower limit of the planet mass as @xmath106 .",
    "this lower limit actually coincides with the actual planet mass within a factor of @xmath107 in this particular case .",
    "in this letter , we have shown an analytic derivation of the depth of the gap created by a planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk . equation ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] )",
    "gives the relationship between the gap depth , planet mass , disk temperature ( aspect ratio ) and viscosity .",
    "since the gap depth strongly depends on the disk aspect ratio , the constraints on the disk temperature is critical in estimating the planet mass from the gap structure .",
    "the disk temperature is obtained by the emissions from optically thick gas / dust , as shown in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we have also argued that the spiral wave can constraint the disk temperature in the observation of optically thin emission .",
    "our model assumed that dust particles and gas have similar distributions .",
    "this assumption is vaild when dust particles are too small to be much affected by the dust filtration .",
    "the assumption would be verified if the dust piling  up is not observed at the outer edge of the gap .",
    "we have applied equation  ( [ eq : gap_depth_mpl ] ) to the dust continuum observations of hl  tau and hd  169142 and derived the estimates of the mass of the planet , which could be responsible for the observed gaps ( at 30  au of hl  tau and at 50  au of hd  169142 ) . at the gap of hl",
    "tau , the dust filtration does not seem so effective becasue no significant dust pilling  up is seen at outer edge of the gap .",
    "we also note that in both the observations of hl  tau and hd  169142 , the gaps we have focused on are only marginally resolved .",
    "therefore , the gap depth quoted in this paper should be regarded as upper limit .",
    "future high resolution observations by alma and/or tmt should put good constraints on the gap depth .",
    "when complex morphologies are found in protoplanetary disks , simple analytic formulae should be useful for interpreting ( at least a part of ) such structures and derive physical quantities .",
