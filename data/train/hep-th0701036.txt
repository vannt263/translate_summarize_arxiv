    "the quantum phase transitions of two ( spatial ) dimensional systems have been the focus of much study in the condensed matter community .",
    "prominent examples include the superfluid - insulator transition in thin films @xcite , the transitions between various quantum hall states @xcite , and magnetic ordering transitions of mott insulators and superconductors which have applications to the cuprate compounds @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in this paper are the transport properties of conserved quantities such as the electrical charge or the total spin : these are characterized by a ( charge or spin ) conductivity @xmath2 , which can in general be a complicated function of frequency @xmath3 , wavevector @xmath4 , temperature @xmath5 , and various couplings characterizing the ground state .",
    "it is often the case that the quantum critical point is described by a strongly interacting quantum field theory in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "examples are ( _ i _ ) the superfluid - insulator transition in the boson hubbard model at integer filling @xcite , which is described by the @xmath7 field theory with o(2 ) symmetry , and so is controlled by the wilson - fisher fixed point in @xmath8 ; ( _ ii _ ) the spin - gap paramagnet to nel order transition of coupled spin dimers / ladders / layers which is described by the o(3 ) @xmath7 field theory @xcite ; and ( _ iii _ ) the ` deconfined ' critical point of a @xmath9 antiferromagnet between a nel and a valence bond solid state @xcite , which is described by the @xmath10 model with a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field @xcite . in all these cases the critical point is described by a relativistic conformal field theory ( cft ) . with an eye towards such experimentally motivated applications , our purpose here is to explore the transport properties of general interacting cfts in @xmath8 .",
    "a crucial property of cfts in @xmath8 ( which actually applies more generally to any critical theory in 2 spatial dimensions which obeys hyperscaling ) is that the conductivity is @xmath11 times a dimensionless number . for u(1 )",
    "currents , there is also a prefactor of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unit of charge  we will drop this factor below . for non - abelian noether currents ,",
    "the normalization of charge is set by a conventional normalization of the generators of the lie algebra .",
    "we will be working with relativistic theories , and therefore set @xmath14 .",
    "initial discussions @xcite of this dimensionless conductivity at the quantum critical point were expressed in terms of ground state correlations of the cft .",
    "let @xmath15 represent the set of conserved currents of the theory ; here @xmath16 is a spacetime index , and @xmath17 labels the generators of the global symmetry",
    ". in the cft , @xmath18 has dimension 2 , and so current conservation combined with lorentz and scale invariance imply for the fourier transform of the retarded correlator @xmath19 at zero temperature is permitted in eq .",

    "we define @xmath25 so that it is analytic in the upper - half - plane of @xmath3 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 are a set of universal , momentum - independent dimensionless constants characterizing the cft , which are the analog of the central charge of the kac - moody algebra of cfts in @xmath29 .",
    "application of the kubo formula at @xmath30 shows that @xcite the @xmath28 are equal to the conductivities @xmath31 , thus setting up the possibility of observing these in experiments .",
    "it was also noted @xcite that particle - vortex duality @xcite of theories with abelian symmetry mapped the @xmath32 conductivities to their inverse ( we review this mapping in section  [ sec : cp1 ] ) . in self - dual theories ,",
    "this imposes constraints on the values of the @xmath28 , possibly allowing them to be determined exactly .",
    "however , the field theories considered in these early works were not self - dual ( see appendix  [ app : cs ] ) .",
    "duality , and possible self - duality , was also considered in the context of theories containing chern - simons terms , relevant to quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "we comment on these works in appendix  [ app : cs ] , but the body of the paper considers only theories without chern - simons terms . for our purposes ,",
    "more relevant is the self - dual field theory proposed recently by motrunich and vishwanath @xcite , and we discuss its charge transport properties below .",
    "it was subsequently pointed out @xcite that the @xmath28 are _ not _ the d.c .",
    "conductivities observed at small but non - zero temperature .",
    "the key point @xcite is that at non - zero @xmath5 , the time @xmath33 is a characteristic ` collision ' or ` decoherence ' time of the excitations of the cft .",
    "consequently the transport at @xmath34 obeys ` collision - dominated ' hydrodynamics , while that at @xmath35 involves ` collisionless ' motion of excitations above the ground state .",
    "therefore , the limits @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not , in general , commute , and must be taken with great care ; the constants @xmath28 above are computed in the limit @xmath38 , while the d.c .",

    "the @xmath20 correlations are the fourier transform of the retarded real time correlators .",
    "these are related by analytic continuation to the euclidean space correlations defined at the matsubara frequencies , which are integer multiples of @xmath43 .",

    "these functions are dimensionless , and hence they can _ only _ depend upon the dimensionless ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as is also the case for the conductivities .",
    "spatial rotational invariance , and the existence of finite correlation length at @xmath20 which ensures analyticity at small @xmath62 , imply that the longitudinal and transverse response are equal to each other at @xmath63 , and , by the kubo formula , are both equal to the zero momentum , frequency dependent complex conductivity , @xmath64 : @xmath65 also at @xmath32 , these functions reduce to the constants in eq .",
    "( [ j0 ] ) : @xmath66    the functions @xmath59 are clearly of great physical interest , and it would be useful to compute them for a variety of cfts . a number of computations have appeared @xcite , and show interesting structure in the conductivity as a function of @xmath60 , encoding the hydrodynamic - to - collisionless crossover for a variety of tractable models . here",
    "we will present some additional results which shed light on the role duality can play on the form of these functions .",

    "the lagrangian formulation of the @xmath10 theory involves two complex scalar fields and one gauge field @xmath68 , which is coupled to a gauge current @xmath69 .",

    "we use the notations of eqs .",
    "( [ j0 ] ) , ( [ j1 ] ) with @xmath74 .",

    "( [ j1 ] ) .",
    "we examine the duality transformations of these function in section  [ sec : cp1 ] and show that the existence of a self - dual critical point leads to the functional relations , as explained in section [ sec : cp1 ] . ]",

    "r - currents in @xmath8 is holographically equivalent to the correlator of a so(8 ) gauge field on an asymptotically ads@xmath83 background . in the large @xmath1 limit , the action of the so(8 ) gauge field is gaussian , and is easily shown to possess electromagnetic ( em ) self - duality under which the electric and magnetic fields are interchanged .",
    "we demonstrate in section  [ sec : emduality ] that it is precisely this em self - duality of the 3 + 1 dimensional gauge field which leads to the constraint ( [ mdual ] ) in the scft .",
