    "modern researchers have been fascinated by how efficiently solar photons are converted into chemical energy in photosynthesis .",
    "initially , photons are absorbed in so - called light - harvesting complexes ( lhcs ) .",
    "the following steps of the cascading energy transfer within lhcs are remarkably efficient : at low light intensities , 9 out of 10 absorbed photons create a charge separated state in the reaction center as the basis for further energy conversion .",
    "@xcite a thorough understanding of this process and its technological utilization will be a major contribution to a sustainable energy concept . accordingly .",
    "this hope has motivated numerous studies , with the aim of finding and characterizing a bio - inspired , artificial light harvesting systems .",
    "@xcite despite the efforts , artificial systems remain still less efficient and less stable than their natural counterparts .",
    "it is generally accpeted that a detailed picture of the involved electronic energy levels as well as the energy dissipation pathways in both artificial and natural light harvesters is crucial in the realization of an efficient and durable bio - mimetic photosystem .    while there is great structural diversity and flexibility in photosynthetic lhcs ,",
    "@xcite essentially only two molecular species serve as pigments , namely carotenoids and ( bacterio)chlorophylls , ( b)chls . carotenoids and ( b)chls are fundamentally different in structure and complementing in physiological function .",
    "carotenoids are linear molecules with varying endgroups .",
    "their optical properties are defined by the @xmath0-conjugated electronic states , extended along the polyene backbone as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sec : figure absorption ] .",
    "the earliest suggested energy flow models used a three - level system with ground state @xmath1 and excited states @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the linear absorption spectra of carotenoids stem from transitions between the electronic ground state @xmath1 and the `` bright '' electronic excited state @xmath2 , whereas the lowest - lying excited state @xmath3 is `` dark '' , with the @xmath4 transition being one - photon forbidden .",
    "the properties of @xmath3 are observed either by two - photon absorption from @xmath1 or by using nonlinear spectroscopy , e.g. transient absorption ( ta ) , where the esa @xmath5 is characteristically strong .",
    "@xcite the population flow rate from @xmath2 and @xmath3 strongly depends on the carotenoid s chain length , with typical transfer times of less than 200fs for solvated carotenoids ( _ in vitro_).besides quenching of harmful long - lived triplet states in ( b)chls and structural support of lhcs , the efficient transfer of the excitation energy from carotenoid to the lower lying ( b)chl states is the main functional role of carotenoids .",
    "the most efficient transfer route occurs from carotenoid s @xmath2 state to the energetically closest ( b)chl - state , namely @xmath6 .",
    "transfer from @xmath3 to @xmath7 is found in several antenna complexes and occurs on a longer timescale than @xmath8.@xcite _ in vivo _",
    ", i.e. as part of a lhc , the lifetime of @xmath2 decreases dramatically .",
    "@xcite for example , in lhcii , the main antenna system of higher plants and algae , the lifetime of the @xmath2 state of the involved carotenoids is @xmath9120 fs _ in vitro _ and only @xmath926 fs _ in vivo _ as measured by fluorescence upconversion , which makes it one of the shortest in naturally occurring systems .",
    "@xcite the reason for this dramatic speed - up in carotenoid lifetime is the interaction with the closely neighboring ( b)chls . chemically , the chromophore of ( b)chls is a nitrogen containing tetrapyrrole - macrocycle with one or two reduced pyrrole rings . according to the four orbital picture of porphyrins , @xcite the absorption spectrum of ( b)chls is described by at least two transitions in the so - called soret band ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 for homo - lumo+1 and homo-1 - lumo+1 , respectively ) and two @xmath12-band transitions ( homo - lumo for @xmath7 and homo-1 - lumo for @xmath6 ) . depending on molecular structure , the @xmath13-band is found in the blue to near - uv spectral region .",
    "the @xmath12-bands stem from transitions with orthogonal transition dipole moments and are energetically degenerate for planar and symmetric porphyrins such as metal - centered phthalocyanines.@xcite ( b)chls show a reduced symmetry in comparison , causing a split of the @xmath12-band . for bchl _ a _ in organic solvents , the @xmath6-band peaks near 600 nm , while the maximum of @xmath7 is found just below 800 nm . despite their structural differences , carotenoids and ( b)chls fulfill complementary tasks in photosynthetic antenna complexes . _ in vivo _ , excitonic coupling and the polar protein environment shift the @xmath7 -band of ( b)chls to the red , thus covering the red edge of the visible solar spectrum .    in this contribution",

    "then , upon the addition of dnase and mgcl@xmath14 , the cells were broken by passage through a french press .",
    "the photosynthetic membranes were collected from the broken - cell mixture by centrifugation and resuspended in the trishcl solution to an optical density ( od ) of 0.6 at 830 nm .",
    "the membranes were then solubilized by the addition of 1%(v / v ) of the detergent n , n - dimethyldodecylamine - n - oxide ( ldao ) .",
    "these solubilized membranes were subjected to sucrose density centrifugation with a step gradient ( as described previously by brotosudarmo _",
    "et al._,@xcite ) in order to fractionate the sample into lh2 and rclh1 complexes .",
    "the lh2 fraction was then further purified by ion - exchange chromatography using diethylaminoethyl cellulose ( de52 , whatman ) .",
    "the bound protein was washed with 20 mm trishcl ph 9.0 containing 0.15% dodecyl maltoside ( dm ) to exchange the ldao detergent and then eluted by adding increasing concentrations of nacl also containing 0.15% dm .",
    "additional purification was achieved by gel - filtration chromatography using a superdex s-200 column ( xk 16/100 , ge healthcare ) which had been equilibrated overnight with 20 mm trishcl ph 9.0 plus 0.15% dm .",
    "the two spectroscopic techniques employed in this article , transient grating ( tg ) and two dimensional electronic spectroscopy ( 2d - es ) are both four wave mixing techniques . in four wave mixing , three excitation pulses interact with the sample to create a non - linear polarization of third order in the field , which acts as a source term for an emerging signal . in the experiment employed here ,",
    "all three excitation fields emerge along individual wavevectors , resulting in a non - linear signal direction which is different from any of the incoming beams .",

    "pulse spectra were chosen to overlap with the investigated sample s absorption spectrum ( see fig.[sec : figure absorption ] ) and compressed down to a temporal fwhm of sub-11 fs in each case , determined by intensity autocorrelation .",
    "the pulses were attenuated by a neutral density filter to yield 8.5nj per excitation pulse at the sample .",
    "this corresponds to a fluence of less than @xmath15 photons/@xmath16 per pulse or 0.5% of excited molecules in the focal volume .",
    "the four wave mixing experiment used for both tg and 2d - es relies on a passively phase stabilized setup with a transmission grating @xcite and has a temporal resolution of 5.3as for @xmath17 , i.e. the delay between the first two pulses and 0.67fs for @xmath18 , the delay between second and third excitation pulse .",
    "a detailed description can be found in milota _ _",

    "sample handling was accomplished by a wire - guided drop jet @xcite with a flow rate of 20 ml / min and a film thickness of approx .",
    "the fact that the jet operates without the use of cell windows allows us to interpret 2d spectra and tg - signals even during pulse overlap ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "all measurements were performed under ambient temperatures ( 295 k ) .        to facilitate the interpretation of the measured 2d - spectra",
    ", results of model calculations were included in the analysis .",
    "it turned out that simulations including only carotenoid allowed most features of the measured 2d spectra to be explained .",
    "therefore the model was based on the properties of the carotenoid component , whereas transfer from carotenoid to bchl only entered in terms of a contribution to lifetime broadening . with regards to electronic transitions it was assumed that the spectral profile of the pulses used in the experiment allows for resonant transitions between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and from @xmath24 to @xmath25 subsequent to population transfer from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . to account for vibrational effects in excitation processes involving the electronic states @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",

    "besides the rate @xmath44 for transfer from @xmath23 to @xmath24 also a transfer rate @xmath45 from @xmath23 to an electronic state @xmath46 of the chlorophyll component of the lh2 complex plays a role in lifetime broadening effects .",
    "the rate of lifetime broadening in @xmath23 consists of the sum @xmath47 and is denoted as @xmath48 .",
    "for lifetime broadening in @xmath24 a rate @xmath49 was introduced .",
    "the response functions can be distinguished by their rephasing or nonrephasing properties and assigned to excitation processes of stimulated emission ( se ) , ground state bleaching ( gsb ) or excited state absorption ( esa ) type , where in the case of se and gsb only the electronic transition dipole moment @xmath50 enters , while for esa components with population transfer the transition dipole moment @xmath51 also appears .",
    "the response functions were formulated in analogy to @xcite and @xcite and are given in the appendix [ sec : response - functions ] .",

    "this effective model of the bath enables us to limit the bath description to one harmonic mode whose dynamics is treated explicitly by a master equation according to @xcite . in this way the mode effectively provides a correct bath spectral density for the energy transfer between the carotenoid and bchl while allowing for a non - perturbative treatment .",

    "accordingly , @xmath193 and @xmath194 were taken as zero .",
    "the huang - rhys factors for excitation from @xmath24 to @xmath25 are known to be much smaller than the ones of the excitation from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . in ref.@xcite a value of @xmath195{}$ ]",

    "however , the much larger huang - rhys factors of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath22 allows for a larger vibrational energy than expected from the value of @xmath196 for the huang - rhys factor .    regarding the brownian oscillator modes ,",
    "it has been reported in @xcite that for double excitation from @xmath24 the reorganization energy corresponds to a fraction of only @xmath197{}$ ] of the corresponding reorganization energy in @xmath24 from the electronic ground state , which was taken as the same as for @xmath23 in our description .",

    "after convolution with the pulses an intensive , positive - valued diagonal peak in the region of ( @xmath204{cm^{-1}}$],@xmath205{cm^{-1}}$ ] ) appears at all population times up to @xmath206 fs , starting from @xmath207{fs}$ ] .",

    "this tendency becomes even more pronounced at @xmath216{fs}$ ] and @xmath217{fs}$ ] , where the esa peak pushes the diagonal peak almost completely above the diagonal .",
    "different from the measured 2d - spectra , the upper diagonal peak at @xmath18=0 to 30fs is missing in the calculated 2d - spectra shown in fig.[fig : simulated - electronic-2d ] , most likely due to the fact that the spectral phase of the pulses was considered as flat in the calculations .",
    "when comparing the spectra from experiment ( fig.[sec : figure 2d_experimental ] ) and simulation ( fig.[fig : simulated - electronic-2d ] ) at @xmath18=30fs , it becomes apparent that the experimentally obtained cross peak , which we identified as an indication of @xmath8 energy transfer , is missing in simulations .",
    "considering that the simulations only incorporate the okenone - part of the spectrum , this missing cross peak confirms our assignment to energy transfer to @xmath6 .",
    "2d - es elucidates why carotenoid to bacteriochlorophyll energy transfer pathways are difficult to analyze in pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite the according cross peak coincides with a recurring negative carotenoid feature ( see @xmath18=30fs and @xmath18=10fs spectrum in fig.[fig : simulated - electronic-2d ] ) . additionally , @xmath8 energy transfer is overlaid with esa from @xmath3 , making it only observable within the ultrashort lifetime of @xmath2 , i.e. only during 55fs in lh2 _ m. pur_.",
    "in this work we have shown that a vibronic coupling mechanism describes several central aspects of the carotenoid to bchl energy transfer dynamics , yielding moderate coupling constants @xmath116 close to 100@xmath65 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with structure - based calculations and reproduces experimental absorption spectra well .",
    "the low values of @xmath116 obtained from the vibronic model suffice for explaining the experimentally observed ultrafast transfer rates .",
    "this is explained by vibronic resonances , which have the potential of dramatically speeding up energy transfer .",
    "@xcite hence , the vibronic coupling mechanism circumvents the shortcomings of frster theory and explains static as well as dynamical properties of natural light harvesters .",
    "the investigated carotenoid - bchl system is an extreme case of a heterodimer , meaning that donor ( carotenoid ) and acceptor ( bchl ) differ in transition energies and hr - factor .",
    "future studies will test the vibronic coupling mechanism on energy transferring dimers where the spectroscopic properties are more alike , such as perylene bisimide dyads.@xcite in such systems , both donor and acceptor show strong electron - phonon coupling , which should make vibronic effects in energy transfer dynamics even more pronounced .",
    "another highly promising class of systems is bulk heterojunction solar cells , where vibronic coupling between donor and acceptor was recently suggested to be the mechanism behind ultrafast electron transfer.@xcite    the authors wish to thank ana moore for providing the dyad sample and heiko lokstein for fruitful discussion .",
