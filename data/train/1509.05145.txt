    "the consideration of doubly special relativity , hence gravity s rainbow , is related to the effects of quantum spacetime . in other words",

    "it is worthwhile to mention that by considering proper values for the energy functions of the gravity s rainbow , this theory would yield a model of the horava - lifshitz which indicates that these theories are related .",
