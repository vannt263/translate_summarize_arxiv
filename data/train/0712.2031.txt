    "in order to illustrate our case , let us assume that a first phase of assisted inflation is driven by @xmath6 scalar fields with an identical potential : @xmath7 this is well studied in ref .",

    "the observed value of @xmath13 is set by cobe normalization , i.e. @xmath14 . hence detectable gravity waves , i.e. @xmath15 , can be generated if  . ] : @xmath16 after inflation the @xmath17 fields will start oscillating coherently ( we assume that they have the same amplitude of oscillations by virtue of identical mass scale ) .",
    "there will be a long wait until the next phase of inflation begins because mssm inflation occurs at a low scale , i.e. @xmath18  gev  @xcite . since all @xmath17 fields are gauge singlets , it is conceivable that their couplings to matter are extremely weak , and hence they do not decay for @xmath19 gev   operators , i.e. non - renormalizable interactions  @xcite , leading to a small decay rate .",
    "it can have a renormalizable coupling to the sm higgs , but for an absolute gauge singlet the strength of such a coupling is not constrained by any symmetry argument .",
    "moreover , such a coupling does not necessarily lead to a complete decay of the inflaton . ] .",
    "then the universe will evolve as in a matter dominated epoch for @xmath20 .    during this intermediate epoch modes which exit the horizon in the last @xmath21 e - foldings of assisted inflation , i.e. between mode i and ii in fig . 1",

    "for example , the mode i in fig .",
    "( 1 ) leaves @xmath26 e - foldings before the end of assisted inflation .",
    "the crucial observation of this paper is that the tensor - to - scalar ratio in such a two phase inflationary model , where the tensor perturbations from the first phase skim through the horizon of the second phase of inflation ( i.e. mode 1 in fig .  1 ) ,",
    "is always bounded by @xmath27 this assumes that the entire scalar perturbations are generated by the second phase of inflation , but its contribution to tensor perturbations is negligible .",
    "this result is generic and does not depend on the details of either the first phase or the second phase of inflation .",
    "the numerical value only depends on the hubble expansion rates for the two phases . in the most optimistic scenario when both the phases of inflations generate similar amplitude , spectral tilt and the running of the spectral tilt",
    ", the above bound can be saturated . on the other hand , if the amplitude of scalar perturbations from the second phase is dominant , then the bound is strict , @xmath28 .",
    "another important comment is that if there was a single phase of inflation driven by the assisted inflation alone , then the tensor - to - scalar ratio would be determined by eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) . in this case",
    "the relevant scalar perturbations are produced at roughly @xmath29 , yielding @xmath30 , which is lower than the maximum value allowed in our scenario , see eq .",
    "( [ imp ] ) .",
    "we now briefly discuss mssm inflation ( for details , see  @xcite ) .",
    "inflation is driven by mssm flat directions , which are classified by _ gauge - invariant _ combination of scalar fields in the theory .",
    "the potential along such a flat direction ( after being minimized along the angular direction ) is given by : [ scpot ] v = 1 2 m^2 _",
    "n^n nm^n-3_p + ^2_n",
    "^2(n-1 ) m^2(n-3)_p , here @xmath31 denotes the radial component of the flat direction field , and @xmath32 is a positive definite quantity of dimension mass .",
    "if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related by @xmath34 , there is a saddle point : [ phi0 ] _ 0 = ( m_m^n-3_p_n)^1/(n-2 ) . where @xmath35 .",
    "the potential is very flat near @xmath36 , and it is given by : [ potential ] v_mssm = ( n-2)^22n(n-1)m^2__0 ^ 2 .",
    "as a result , if the flat direction field is in the vicinity of @xmath36 ( and has a sufficiently small kinetic energy ) , there will be an ensuing phase of inflation .",
    "the hubble expansion rate during inflation is given by [ hubble ] h_mssm = ( n-2 ) m _ _ 0 m_p .",
    "inflation ends when @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the slow roll parameters .",
    "the number of e - foldings between the time when the observationally relevant perturbations are generated and the end of inflation follows  @xcite : _ cobe 66.9 + 1 4   ln ( v_mssm m^4_p ) 50 . here",
    "we have used the fact that , due to efficient reheating  @xcite , the energy density in the inflaton gets converted into radiation very quickly after the end of mssm inflation .",
    "the amplitude of scalar perturbations thus produced is given by : [ ampl ] _ h ( n-2 )   ( m_m_p _ 0 ^ 2 )   n_cobe^2 .",

    "mssm inflation can produce up to @xmath42 e - foldings of slow roll inflation  @xcite .",
    "however the exact number of e - foldings in the slow roll regime depends on the initial vev of the inflaton . since in our case",
    "assisted inflation sets the initial conditions for the mssm inflation , we are focusing on those hubble patches where the inflaton vev matches to provide @xmath43 . on the other hand , in those regions where this criteria is not met",

    "( [ phi0],[hubble ] ) , we have @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 .",
    "another important point for an mssm inflation is that the model parameters naturally accommodate thermal dark matter , i.e. successful inflation is compatible with the allowed regions of the parameter space which yield the correct abundance of neutralino dark matter  @xcite .",
    "although we invoke assisted inflation for generating gravity waves , it also serves another useful purpose as it can set the initial conditions for the mssm inflation  @xcite",
    ". the phase of assisted inflation will induce large quantum fluctuations to the flat direction since @xmath55 .",
    "the flat direction will make quantum jumps in this phase which accumulate in a random walk fashion  @xcite : @xmath56 .",
    "then the required number of e - foldings of assisted inflation , which is required to push @xmath57 to the vicinity of @xmath36 follows @xmath58  @xcite . for @xmath53  gev and @xmath59  gev",
    ", the required number of e - foldings turns out to be @xmath60 .",
    "this is quite feasible in assisted inflation with a sufficiently large number of fields  @xcite  .",
    "now we wish to analyze the evolution of tensor and scalar modes from the first phase of inflation .",
    "note that the phase of mssm inflation requires at least @xmath61 e - foldings in order to explain the observed scalar perturbations  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in those tensor modes which just skim through the horizon of the mssm inflation , i.e. modes that were of the horizon size when mssm inflation began",
    ". they will be observable today if mssm inflation lasted the minimum number of required e - foldings , i.e. @xmath62 .    these modes ( tensor and scalar ) left the horizon about @xmath24 e - foldings before the end of assisted inflation , see eq .",
    "( [ efold ] ) .",
    "modes that left earlier will be well outside the horizon when mssm inflation started , and hence today as well .",
    "on the other hand , modes that left later will re - enter the horizon before the onset of mssm inflation and get suppressed . in this section , we will discuss this issue in detail .",
    "the evolution of the scalar curvature perturbations in the early universe can be followed by using the _ gauge - invariant _ mukhanov variable @xmath63  @xcite , which on flat hypersurfaces is related to the fluctuation of the scalar field , @xmath64 , simply by @xmath65 .",
    "the curvature perturbation , @xmath66 , is related to the variable @xmath63 by   [ udef ] u =- z , where the variable @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68 .",
    "the fourier modes of @xmath63 , denoted by @xmath69 , evolve according to @xcite [ uequ ] _",
    "^2u_k + ( k^2 - ) u_k=0 , where @xmath70 denotes conformal time .",
    "the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is given by [ power ] _",

    ". deep inside the hubble radius , when @xmath71 , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ uequ ] ) tends to the free field bunch - davies vacuum solution ( with arbitrary normalization ) [ freesol ] u_k^-ik .",
    "well outside the hubble radius , @xmath72 , the growing solution is simply [ freesol2 ] u_kz , indicating that the curvature perturbation tends to a constant outside the hubble radius . from these considerations",
    "the qualitative picture is clear : the vacuum modes are stretched during inflation until they exit the horizon , resulting in a constant curvature perturbation at superhubble scales .      for the tensor modes ,",
    "the situation is similar to the scalar case but there are also important differences .",
    "the equation determining the evolution of modes is now [ gravmodes ] v_k+(k^2-)=0 , where @xmath73 is related the gravity wave power spectrum by [ gravspec ] p_g^1/2=| | .",
    "again , deep inside the horizon ( @xmath74 ) we have the free field solution for a mode [ gravinside ] v_ke^-ik which freezes after leaving the horizon ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 .      in order to see the effect of the second phase of inflation on the modes that have been generated and left the horizon during the first phase , we rewrite the equations in terms of physical properties of the cosmic fluid , i.e. instead of considering the scalar field and its potential , @xmath31 and @xmath77",
    ", we express eq .",
    "( [ uequ ] ) in terms of the equation of state of the fluid , @xmath78 .",
    "this allows us to study general fluids and their effect on the primordial power spectrum without the need to specify the potential .",
    "here we concentrate on fluids with @xmath79 , but a similar analysis is straightforward to carry out also when @xmath80 .    by defining the effective equation of state @xmath81 and using the definitions of pressure and energy density for a scalar field with a canonical kinetic term , eq .",
    "( [ uequ ] ) can be written as    [ uequ3 ] u_k  - 12 ( 1 + 3)u_k + u_k = 0 ,    where @xmath82 .",
    "this is a general result valid for @xmath79 .",
    "in particular one can use eq .",
    "( [ uequ3 ] ) to study the evolution of perturbations during transition periods in the early universe when the effective equation of state changes .    similarly for gravity waves , we have [ vequ1 ] v_k  - 12 ( 1 + 3)v_k + v_k = 0 .",
    "note the qualitative difference between the two equations , as long as the equation of state is constant , both @xmath69 and @xmath69 will evolve in a similar fashion .",
    "however , when the equation of state changes , i.e. when inflation stops ( or a second phase of inflation starts ) , scalar and tensor modes will evolve differently .",
    "in order to solve the mode equations numerically , one needs to specify the initial conditions .",
    "we adopt the approach also followed , for example , in  @xcite and start the calculation for each mode deep inside the horizon , where it can be accurately described by the free field solution [ freefield ] u_k ,  v_k=^-ik . by integrating eq .",
    "( [ uequ3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ vequ1 ] ) for each @xmath83-mode , one can determine the produced spectrum via eqs .",

    "it is useful to integrate the real and imaginary parts of @xmath69 and @xmath73 separately .",
    "-modes and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 , @xmath86.,width=264 ]    the equation of state changes from inflation , with @xmath87 , to a matter dominated universe with @xmath88 and then back to an inflationary epoch .",
    "the transition between the different phases is modeled with a hyperbolic tangent , [ hyptan ] ( ) & = & _ 0 + 12(_1-_0)(((-_0))+ + & & ( ( _ 1- ) ) ) , where @xmath89 marks the end of the first phase of inflation and the beginning of the matter / radiation dominated epoch , @xmath90 is when the second inflationary phase begins and @xmath91 is a parameter determining the smoothness of the transition .",
    "in a realistic situation we expect that the transition from matter domination to mssm inflation be smooth .",
    "the mssm flat direction has frozen near the saddle point and carries a constant potential energy @xmath92 .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath17 fields which drive assisted inflation , see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , behave as matter and dominate the universe during the intermediate stage .",
    "their amplitude is redshifted by the hubble expansion until the mssm flat direction takes over . as a result , since there are no sudden changes in the potential of assisted or mssm inflatons , the equation of state of the universe changes smoothly from that of matter domination to inflation .",
    "the transition to the second phase of inflation can be accurately modeled as follows .",
    "consider a universe filled with two fluids , @xmath93 with two different equations of state @xmath94 so that @xmath95 .",

    "( [ spectra-1 ] ) we have shown the evolution of the amplitude of the tensor modes , @xmath105 , as a function of @xmath101 . the tensor spectrum on the very large angular scales is solely given by the one arising from the assisted inflation .",
    "the mode that just grazes the horizon , @xmath106 , as the second inflationary phase begins , can be calculated by considering the evolution of @xmath107 . during",
    "the first inflationary phase @xmath108 is constant , and hence @xmath109 .",

    "( [ spectra ] ,  [ specdet ] ) we show the tensor and scalar power spectrum , @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively . from the figure",
    "one can read that both spectra are dropping with @xmath83 with a large power . in the case of tensor perturbations ,",
    "i.e. @xmath120 in good agreement with analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "the rate of decay is constant over the studied range of @xmath83 , hence a general prediction of the scenario described here is that the tensor spectrum is very red with distinct bumps .",
    "the remnant scalar spectrum from the first phase of inflation also drops rapidly with increasing @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the tensor and scalar spectra exhibit anti - correlation so that an increase in scalar power means less power in the tensor power at the same scale ( and vice versa ) .    .",
    "the largest mode corresponds to the critical mode grazing the horizon.,width=264 ]    if the whole observed scalar spectrum is due to the mssm inflation and does not have features due to remnants from the assisted inflationary phase , then one expects that the tensor spectrum should be observable only at the very largest scales .",
    "for example , if the tensor - to - scalar ratio at @xmath121 is of the order @xmath122 , then at @xmath123 , corresponding to @xmath124 in fig .",
    "[ specdet ] ) , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is roughly @xmath125 .",
    "so far we have assumed that the current horizon corresponds to the critical mode @xmath126 .",
    "if we relax this assumption along with the details of the first inflationary phase , we have much more freedom in the scenario .",
    "for example , if the amplitude of scalar perturbations from the first phase of inflation is larger than the observed value , implying a higher scale for the assisted inflationary phase , one can have the current horizon corresponding to a mode that has been sufficiently re - processed in between inflationary phases .",
    "then one would still have the second phase of inflation producing scalar perturbations on all observable scales but now the horizon size can correspond to a mode which is smaller than the critical one , i.e. @xmath127 .",
    "for this mode one can read from fig .",
    "( [ specdet ] ) that the tensor - to - scalar ratio is amplified by an order of magnitude from its initial value .",
    "the other option is to consider scenarios where the observed scalar spectrum is a combination of the two inflationary phases .",
    "this naturally implies that there is a break in the scalar spectrum , therefore one would expect to see feature in the scalar spectrum . in all of the cases",
    "the main observable prediction remains , a very red tensor spectrum with distinct bumps observable at the largest scales .",
    "this can be associated with anti - correlated features in the scalar spectrum .",
    "the anti - correlation between scalar and tensor spectra can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "first of all note that the frequencies of tensor and scalar modes are different , see eqs .",
    "( [ uequ3],[vequ1 ] ) , they differ by the time variation in the equation of state as it changes from matter domination to inflation",
    ". this mainly affects modes whose wavelength is of the order of horizon size when the second phase of inflation began , i.e. modes to the left of fig .",
    "( [ specdet ] ) . as a result",
    "the tensor and scale modes start oscillating at different times which leads to a phase difference between them . for modes which are deep inside the horizon at that time , i.e. modes to the right of fig .",
    "( [ specdet ] ) , @xmath128 is large and the first term inside the brackets in eqs .",
    "( [ uequ3],[vequ1 ] ) dominate , leading to the same frequency for scalar and tensor modes . hence the modes tend to become correlated to each other at larger values of @xmath83 ( larger values of multipoles , @xmath129 ) .",
    "these are the features which distinguish our scenario with respect to the case where gravity waves arise _ solely _ from a single phase of inflation .",
    "we have illustrated a simple example where we can generate observable gravity waves from assisted inflation at high scales @xmath130 gev , while the origin of temperature anisotropy arises mainly from a low scale mssm inflation @xmath131 gev .",
    "the latter is also responsible for reheating the universe to the sm baryons and the cold dark matter .",
    "the two phases of inflation are separated by a matter dominated epoch from coherent oscillations of the fields that drove assisted inflation .",
    "being absolute gauge singlets , as usually assumed , these fields do not directly couple to matter , therefore , it is conceivable that they do not decay before the second phase of inflation kicks in .",
    "the assisted inflation phase also creates the appropriate initial conditions for the mssm inflation .",
    "this is a natural outcome due to the high scale of inflation , which imparts large quantum fluctuations to the mssm flat direction that push it to the vicinity of the desired vev , @xmath53  gev , within @xmath132 e - foldings of assisted inflation .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio for a mode which is skimming through the second phase of inflation is bounded by eq .",

    "<S> it is plausible that the scalar density perturbations are created by a relatively low scale model of inflation which matches the observations of cmb anisotropy and excites standard model baryons and cold dark matter , but generates negligible gravity waves . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless a significantly large tensor perturbations can be observed if there exists a prior phase of high scale inflation separated by a matter or radiation dominated epoch . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple example where gravity waves generated at high scales can trickle through the horizon of the second phase of inflation and leave a distinct imprint in the spectrum of the tensor modes with a strong red tilt . a first phase of _ assisted inflation _ occurring at a high scale @xmath0  gev is followed by a second phase of _ mssm inflation _ which happens at @xmath1  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the largest tensor - to - scalar ratio is then bounded by @xmath2 on the largest scales , roughly of the size of the horizon .    the positive detection of stochastic gravitational waves , especially at very large angular scales , </S>",
    "<S> is considered to be a strong support for the inflation paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the planck satellite will be able to detect gravity waves if the tensor to scalar ratio is significant , i.e. @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is however a daunting task to generate large tensor perturbations in a reasonable model of inflation which is embedded within particle physics  @xcite and in string inspired models of inflation  @xcite . in realistic models based on the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> where the inflaton carries the standard model ( sm ) charges and eventually decays into the sm baryons and the cold dark matter , inflation occurs at very low scales and generated gravity waves are too small to be detectable in the future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> a significant tensor to scalar ratio is obtained in chaotic inflation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however in this class of models the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the inflaton exceeds the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the inflaton is an absolute gauge singlet carrying no sm charges , thus rendering the model with no real connection to particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible scenario with sub - planckian vevs , called _ assisted inflation _ , arises when multi - scalar fields collectively drive inflation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assisted inflation has found more realistic connection to particle physics  @xcite and string theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can generate a reasonable tensor - to - scalar ratio which could potentially be detected by the future cmb experiments .    in spite of these successes , assisted inflation can not automatically explain the sm baryons and cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the model can at best be embedded in a hidden sector , so far , whose couplings to the sm fields are essentially set by hand . </S>",
    "<S> this situation remains in string theory , as the inflation sector and the matter sector are often not the same  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> tensor perturbations in two field inflationary models have been studied in  @xcite , where both the phases of inflation occur at super - planckian vevs . </S>",
    "<S> it was envisaged that a contribution to the scalar perturbations came from both phases of inflation , thus producing a break in the power spectrum for the temperature anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> similar break in power spectrum for tensor perturbations were studied in  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to avoid inflation at super - planckian vevs while still generating significant tensor perturbations with a large tensor - to - scalar ratio . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we wish to generate the entire scalar perturbations during the second phase of inflation in order not to have any observable break in the power spectrum for the cmb temperature anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> third important point is that we wish to present a realistic model of inflation where reheating to the standard model baryons and cold dark matter is automatic and there are no uncertainties in the inflaton coupling to matter .    </S>",
    "<S> here we aim to keep all of the virtues of an mssm based low scale inflation with direct connection to rich phenomenology  @xcite , but modify the physics at higher energies , such that gravity waves can trickle past through the horizon of the mssm inflation </S>",
    "<S> . the idea will be to have two phases of inflation where the first one contributes to the tensor modes , while the latter provides scalar density perturbations and successful reheating into the ( dark ) matter . </S>",
    "<S> we strictly assume that the entire cmb temperature anisotropy arises from the second phase of inflation , therefore , there is no break in its power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the first phase of inflation can also set initial conditions for a low scale inflation as we will discuss briefly    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ infladiagram ] we show a schematic diagram of the scenario , two inflationary phases separated by a matter / radiation dominated epoch . for the purpose of our discussion , without loss of generality , we will only concentrate on a matter dominated intermediate epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the largest observable scale is somewhere between the scale where the first phase of inflation , mode i , ends and the second starts , mode ii . here for simplicity we mainly concentrate on the case where the largest observable scale corresponds to the scale where the mssm inflation starts , i. e. mode i in the figure .        </S>",
    "<S> there will be a clear prediction for the tensor modes in our case compared to the case where both of the tensor and scalar perturbations are generated by a single phase of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction is that we would see the tensor modes _ only _ on the largest angular scales , i.e. @xmath4 , and there will be a sharp drop in the correlations involving the tensor component at smaller angular scales with a power dropping @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also see that scalar and tensor modes arising from the first phase of inflation are anti - correlated . </S>"
