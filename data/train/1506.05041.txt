    "for example , what is the difference in the distribution of jammed packings generated via isotropic compression versus shear ?",

    "<S> we propose a theoretical framework for predicting the protocol dependence of the jamming transition for frictionless spherical particles that interact via repulsive contact forces . </S>",
    "<S> we study isostatic jammed disk packings obtained via two protocols : isotropic compression and simple shear . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for frictionless systems , all jammed packings can be obtained via either protocol . however , the probability to obtain a particular jammed packing depends on the packing - generation protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the average shear strain required to jam initially unjammed isotropically compressed packings from the density of jammed packings , shape of their basins of attraction , and path traversed in configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our predictions to simulations of shear strain - induced jamming and find quantitative agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the packing fraction range , over which shear strain - induced jamming occurs , tends to zero in the large system limit for frictionless packings with overdamped dynamics . </S>"
