    "a complete long - range ordering and a perfect fm / sc interface seem to be inevitable for the utilization of the half - metallic properties of co@xmath0fesi  @xcite , i.e. to reach a high degree of spin polarization and successful spin injection into the semiconductor without severe scattering .",

    "reflectivity measurements are sensitive to mass densities and not to the crystallinity and the deformation fields of the film . a characteristic mass density profile , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : reflectivity ] , can occur for a diffusion zone @xcite because diffusion is mutual : on the one hand co , fe , and si diffuse into the gaas whereas on the other hand ga and as diffuse into the co@xmath0fesi . the diffusion of co , fe , and si into the gaas was confirmed earlier by sims revealing that the diffusion of co is more pronounced than the diffusion of fe and si .",

    "the peak positions of co@xmath0fesi and gaas coincided because both materials have nearly the same lattice parameter , i.e. there was a vanishing misfit strain , the films were stoichiometric on average .",
    "the co@xmath0fesi peak was broader than the gaas substrate reflection due to the small film thickness .",
    "interference fringes were pronounced for @xmath7  =  100  and  200  @xmath8c indicating a high interface quality , whereas the fringes were far less visible for @xmath7  =  300  @xmath8c . however , after more careful inspection we observed a varying amplitude of the thickness fringes similar to a beating effect .",

    "it may have occurred as a result of diffusion processes .",
    "the profiles of the lattice deformations were smoother than the profile of the mass density obtained from reflectivity measurements ( fig .",

    ", we obtained depth profiles of the lattice parameter revealing inhomogeneities inside the co@xmath0fesi film .",
    "probably there was not only diffusion of co , fe , and si into the gaas buffer layer below the fm / sc interface but also into the opposite direction towards a native oxide and the free surface .",
    "ga and as also diffused into the co@xmath0fesi film .",
    "@xcite on the other hand direct measurements of surface temperature during mbe growth revealed an unintentional increase of @xmath7 during growth of about 50  k - 60  k at these low growth temperatures , which probably had an additional influence on diffusion .",
    "we saw an impact of diffusion on the structural properties of the fm / sc hybrid structures .",
    "therefore diffusion barriers are urgently needed in order to maintain the stoichiometry and the long - range order all over the film .",
    "the average stoichiometry was tuned by minimization of the lattice mismatch between the growing co@xmath0fesi film and the gaas substrate .",
    "@xcite however , the constituents of films and substrate have different diffusion coefficients and the amounts of atoms leaving their original positions were not equal . in this manner",
    "diffusion processes during and after growth lead to local deviations of stoichiometry .",

    "<S> an average long - range order of 30 - 60@xmath3 was measured by grazing - incidence x - ray diffraction , i.e. the as - grown co@xmath0fesi films were highly but not fully ordered . </S>",
    "<S> lateral inhomogeneities of the spatial distribution of long - range order in co@xmath0fesi were found using dark - field tem images taken with superlattice reflections . </S>"
