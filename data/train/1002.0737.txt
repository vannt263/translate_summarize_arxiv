    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are extremely stable and accurate cosmic clocks due to their short spin periods and the high degree of rotational stability .",
    "the technique of pulsar timing is the regular monitoring of the rotation of these objects by tracking the times of arrival ( toas ) of the radio pulses .",
    "frequent measurements of pulse arrival times of pulsars provide a powerful tool to determine their spin and astrometric parameters to a very high degree of precision",
    ".    high precision timing of radio millisecond pulsars , most of which are members of binary systems , can be the key to a number of unanswered problems in fundamental physics and astronomy , ranging from stellar evolution to tests of gravitational physics in the strong field regime and the detection of a cosmological gravitational wave background .",
    "the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) network ( table [ tab : epta ] ) is a collaboration between the five institutes ( astron , jbo , inaf , mpifr and nanay observatory ) operating the largest radio telescopes in europe .",
    "it is consisting of the effelsberg 100 m radiotelescope of the max - planck - institute for radioastronomy ( mpifr ) in germany , the 76 m lovell radiotelescope of the manchester university , at jodrell bank , uk , the 94 m equivalent westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) of astron in the netherlands , the 94 m equivalent nanay decimetric radio telescope ( nrt ) in france and soon the 64 m sardinia radio telescope ( srt ) in italy .",
    "the epta is using the available telescopes for high - precision timing in a coordinated way , in schedules and source lists .",
    "this results , in larger and denser datasets in multiple frequencies .",
    "in addition , exchange of data , people and knowledge between the working groups is ordinarily happening , resolving swiftly any systematic telescope problems or other issues .",
    "the main aim of the epta is to increase the precision and quality of pulsar timing measurements , to study the astrophysics of millisecond pulsars and to detect cosmological gravitational waves from coalescent massive binary black holes in the nano - hertz regime .",

    "several millisecond pulsars have been chosen from the effelsberg source list .",
    "on the archival data of those , new calibration techniques were applied @xcite , i.e. ephemeris update , noise removal from individual channels , new time corrections , summation of individual scans and creation of new synthetic templates @xcite .",

    "work is in progress for combination of the datasets from all the epta telescopes for all of these sources , which will improve the current measurements and take us closer to the desired detection limit . until reaching this point",
    "the combined datasets are being used for doing high precision timing analysis of the individual systems , as it is shown in the following section for psr j1012 + 5307 .",
    "psr j1012 + 5307 is a 5.3ms pulsar in a low eccentricity binary system with orbital period of @xmath414.5h @xcite and a low mass helium white dwarf ( wd ) companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the measured optical luminosity of the wd to the value expected from wd models and calculated a distance of @xmath5pc .",
    "in addition they measured , a radial velocity component of @xmath6kms@xmath7 relative to the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) , and the mass ratio of the pulsar and its companion @xmath8 .",
    "finally they derived a companion mass of @xmath9 , a pulsar mass of @xmath10 and an orbital inclination angle of @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite presented a complete precision timing analysis of psr j1012 + 5307 using 4 years of timing data from effelsberg and 7 years from lovell radio telescope .",
    "they derived the spin , astrometric and binary parameters for the system and they discussed the prospects of future measurements of post - keplerian parameters ( pk ) which can contribute to the derivation of stringent limits on alternative gravity theories .    in this work psr j1012",
    "+ 5307 has been revisited with seven more years of high - precision timing data and combined datasets from the epta telescopes .",
    "the data have been analyzed using the timing software tempo .      combining almost 3000 toas , at five different frequencies from the four telescopes now in use by the epta",
    ", we have been able to improve on the timing solution and on all the astrometric , spin and binary parameters of this system , see figure [ fig : postfit ] .    for the first time",
    "a parallax @xmath12mas has been measured for psr j1012 + 5307 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath13pc which is consistent with the @xmath5 pc measured from the optical observations .",
    "in addition , the proper motion measurements have been improved by an order of magnitude , with a total proper motion of @xmath14masyr@xmath7 yielding a total transverse velocity of @xmath15kms@xmath7 . using the radial velocity from the optical measurements , the space velocity of the system",
    "@xmath16kms@xmath7 has been calculated , being consistent and almost three times more precise than the previous value .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath17 has been obtained , being consistent with the evolutionary scenario of spin - up of psr j1012 + 5307 through mass transfer from the companion , while it is in the red giant phase .",
    "a change in the projected semi - major axis of @xmath18 has been measured in the current analysis , which has been used to constrain for the first time the position angle of the ascending node .    as predicted by @xcite",
    "a significant measurement of the change in the orbital period of the system , @xmath19 , has been obtained for the first time .",
    "this is caused by the doppler correction , which is the combined effect of the proper motion of the system @xcite and a correction term for the galactic acceleration and by a contribution due to the quadrupole term of the gravitational wave emission , as predicted by general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "after subtracting these two contributions from our measured value , the excess value of @xmath20 confirms the validity of gr for one more millisecond pulsar binary system .",
    "all the terms mentioned above are the ones expected to contribute by using gr as our theory of gravity . however , there are alternative theories of gravity , that violate the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) and predict extra contributions to the observed orbital period variation .",
    "one is the dipole term of the gravitational wave emission , which results from the difference in gravitational binding energy of the two bodies of a binary system .",
    "thus , the case of psr j1012 + 5307 , where there is a pulsar - wd system , is ideal for testing the strength of such emission .",
    "one finds for small - eccentricity pulsar - wd systems , where the sensitivity @xmath21 ( related to the gravitational self - energy of a body ) of the wd is much smaller than the one of the pulsar , @xmath22 , @xcite where @xmath23 and @xmath0 is the reduced mass .",
    "@xmath24 is the sensitivity of the pulsar and @xmath25 refers to the dipole self - gravitational contribution , which takes different values for different theories of gravity ( zero for gr ) .",
    "another term is predicted by the variation of the locally measured gravitational constant as the universe expands , @xmath26 p_{b } $ ] , @xcite where @xmath27 is the total mass of the system .",
    "it has been shown that there is no need to add these extra contributions to explain the variations of the orbital period , however the excess value has been used to set limits for a wide class of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "psr j1012 + 5307 is an ideal lab for constraining the dipole radiation term because the wd nature of the companion is affirmed optically , the mass estimates are free of any explicit strong - field effects and the mass of the pulsar is rather high , which is important in the case of strong field effects that occur only above a certain critical mass , like the spontaneous scalarisation @xcite .",
    "thus , by using the @xmath28yr@xmath7 limit from the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) @xcite the @xmath29 contribution has been calculated and subtracted from our excess value in order to finally obtain an improved generic limit for the dipole contribution of @xmath30 ( 95 per cent c.l . ) .    a generic test for @xmath31 can not be done with a single binary pulsar , since general theories that predict a variation of the gravitational constant typically also predict the existence of dipole radiation .",
    "this degeneracy has been broken here in a joint analysis of psr j1012 + 5307 and psr j0437@xmath24715 @xcite , two binary pulsar - wd systems with tight limits for @xmath32 and different orbital periods . by applying equation @xmath33 - 4 \\pi^2 \\frac{t_\\odot\\mu}{p_b^2 } \\ , \\kappa_{\\rm d } s_p^2 \\nonumber\\\\$ ] to both binary pulsars , and solving in a monte - carlo simulation ( figure [ fig : montekg ] )",
    "this set of two equations , stringent and generic limits based purely on pulsar data and in the strong field regime have been obtained . with a 95 per cent c.l . , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the future ,",
    "more accurate measurements of @xmath36 and distance of the two pulsars and wds could constrain even more our derived limits .      we are grateful to all the epta collaborators for providing data , for valuable discussions and for their overall help .",
    "ln addition , to all staff at the epta radio telescopes for their help with the observations .",
