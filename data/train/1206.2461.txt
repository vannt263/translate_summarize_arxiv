    "due to their large mass , the heavy quark pairs are considered to be produced in hard scatterings of partons which can be described perturbatively . however , the bound states of heavy quark pairs are formed via soft non - perturbative processes . because of this interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative aspects , quarkonium production is a unique and a very important testing case for qcd . various theoretical approaches , recently reviewed in @xcite",
    "were proposed to describe the data .",
    "however the consistent description of both the differential production cross - sections and the polarization proved to be difficult to achieve .",
    "l0.40    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath0 is a spin-1 boson allowing for three degenerated states corresponding to projections of the angular momentum @xmath1 ( transversal polarization ) and @xmath2 ( longitudinal polarization ) .",
    "r0.40     the observed polarization is a superposition of the polarization from all the production mechanisms thus making this measurement a very important constraint for theoretical calculations .",
    "existing models have difficulties in describing at the same time both the @xmath0 production cross - section and the polarization .",
    "in particular nrqcd at leading order predicts for high-@xmath3 @xmath0 a large transverse polarization at cdf energies @xcite .",
    "alice measured the @xmath0 polarization at forward - rapidity in the helicity ( @xmath4axis is the @xmath0 own momentum direction in the center - of - mass frame of the pp collision ) and collins - soper ( @xmath4axis is the bisector of the angle between the direction of one beam and the opposite of the direction of the other one , in the rest frame of the @xmath0 ) frames .",
    "the measured angular distribution of the decay leptons is parameterized using the general form @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the polar ( azimuthal ) angles .",
    "the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters extracted from data which quantify the degree of polarization .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : dndypolariz ] shows the alice results on @xmath8 and @xmath9 for inclusive @xmath0 at forward - rapidity @xcite . in both reference frames all the parameters",
    "are compatible with zero .",
    "recent nlo calculations within the nrqcd factorization @xcite have shown good agreement with the alice results .    to investigate further the @xmath0 production mechanisms , the yield was measured as a function of the charged particle pseudo - rapidity density @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig : jpsimult ] presents the relative @xmath0 yield at mid- and forward - rapidity as a function of the relative charged particle density at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the @xmath0 production at both mid- and forward - rapidity tends to be accompanied by the production of many other charged hadrons . a possible reason for the observed results could be multiple partonic interactions @xcite .",
    "we presented results obtained by the alice collaboration on @xmath0 production in pp collisions at @xmath122.76 and .",
    "the inclusive cross - sections as a function of @xmath3 and rapidity were shown .",
    "the nlo nrqcd calculations show a good agreement with the alice results at forward - rapidity .",
    "the measured polarization parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are compatible with zero .",
    "we have also shown that the relative @xmath0 yields at mid- and forward - rapidity increase linearly with the charged particle density at mid - rapidity .",
