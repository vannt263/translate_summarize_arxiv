    ", they are more flexible than other approaches simply utilizing jumps and this led to many applications in physics , biology and , with an increasing interest , in finance .",
    "quite remarkably , shot - noise effects were already introduced in the early 20th century , see @xcite , sometimes also referred to as schottky - noise .",
    "first fundamental treatments were only developed many years later with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "applications of shot - noise processes also arise in insurance mathematics , marketing , and even astronomy - see the survey article @xcite .",
    "the first appearances in a finance context seem to be @xcite while in insurance mathematics this class of processes were studied even earlier , see @xcite for literature in this regard .    in a general form ,",
    "denote by @xmath0 the arrival times of the shots , and by @xmath1 a family of stochastic processes representing the noises , then a _ shot - noise process _",
    "@xmath2 is given by the superposition @xmath3 an example at this level of generality can be found in @xcite .",
    "of course , absolute convergence of the sum needs to be justified , typically by making assumptions on the arrival times together with suitable restrictions on the noise processes . for the consideration of stationarity ,",
    "the process is often extended to the full real line .    at this level of generality ,",
    "shot - noise processes extend compound poisson processes significantly and neither need to be markovian nor semimartingales .",
    "while the definition in is very general , more restrictions will be needed to guarantee a higher level of tractability . in this paper",
    "we will focus on shot - noise processes which are semimartingales . to the best of our knowledge all articles , including @xcite and many others , assume that the noises are i.i.d .  and independent from the arrival times of the shots .",
    "the most common assumption even leads to a piecewise deterministic markov process : this is the case , if the noise processes are given by @xmath4 with i.i.d .",
    "@xmath5 , independent from @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we will show later that this is essentially the only example where markovianity is achieved .",
    "more general cases allow for different decay , as for example a power - law decay , see e.g.  @xcite , or do not assume a multiplicative structure for the jump heights @xmath8 .",
    "these cases can be summarized under the assumption that @xmath9 with some general random variables @xmath8 and a suitable ( deterministic ) function @xmath10 .",
    "the obtained class of processes is surprisingly tractable , and the reason for this is that the fourier and laplace transforms of @xmath2 are available in explicit form , depending on the considered level of generality . due to linearity of the integral ,",
    "the class is stable under integration , a property shared by affine processes and of high importance for applications in interest rate markets and credit risk , see @xcite .",
    "a branch of literature considers limits of shot - noise processes when the intensity of the shot arrivals increases and shows , interestingly , that limits of this class of processes have fractional character , see @xcite , and the early studies in insurance mathematics .",
    "the application of shot - noise processes to the modelling of consumer behaviour has been suggested in @xcite , wherein also the necessary statistical tools have been developed .",
    "the key in this approach is that i.i.d .",
    "shot - noise processes are at hand which allows a good access to statistical methodologies .    in the financial and insurance community",
    "they have been typically used to efficiently model shock effects , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . besides this , in @xcite an estimation procedure in a special class of shot - noise processes utilizing the generalized method of moments ( gmm ) is developed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : setup ] we introduce a suitably general formulation of shot - noise processes and derive their conditional characteristic function .",
    "moreover , we study the connection to semimartingales and markov processes .",
    "proposition [ prop : markovian ] proves that exponential decay is equivalent to markovianity of the shot - noise process . in section [ sec : fm ]",
    "we propose a model for stocks having a shot - noise component . after the study of equivalent and absolutely continuous measure changes",
    "we obtain a drift condition implying absence of arbitrage and give an example where independence and stationarity of increments holds under the objective and the equivalent martingale measure .",

    "this is the unique martingale @xmath211 , such that for each @xmath56 , @xmath212 coincides with the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath213 . here",
    "we denote by @xmath214 the restriction of @xmath100 to @xmath215 ( and similarly for @xmath206 ) .",
    "[ prop : absolutemc ] assume that * ( a1 ) * and * ( a2 ) * hold and @xmath219 .",
    "then there exists a @xmath220-measurable non - negative function @xmath221 such that the density process @xmath211 of @xmath206 relative to @xmath100 coincides with @xmath222 on @xmath223 for all @xmath166 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is a ( possibly explosive ) marked point process under @xmath206 and its compensator w.r.t .",
    "@xmath206 is given by @xmath224    we apply theorem iii.5.43 in @xcite and refer to their notation for this proof .",
    "note that because the compensator of @xmath31 is absolutely continuous , @xmath225 ( compare equation iii.5.2 ) and therefore @xmath19 given in equation iii.5.6 satisfies @xmath226 .",
    "furthermore , the process @xmath227 given in equation iii.5.7 satisfies @xmath228 in general , @xmath227 could explode , so that following iii.5.9 we consider @xmath229 and define @xmath230 by @xmath231 proposition iii.5.10 yields that there exists a unique @xmath115 which coincides with @xmath232 at least on all random intervals @xmath233 , @xmath234 .",
    "theorem iii.5.43 yields that under our assumptions the density @xmath211 coincides with @xmath235 as inspection of formula iii.5.21 shows .",
    "this gives our claim .",
    "as @xmath100 and @xmath206 are equivalent and we consider only non - explosive marked point processes , @xmath240 .",
    "hence @xmath241 for all @xmath238 , almost surely with respect to @xmath100 and @xmath206 .",
    "also , @xmath242 : let @xmath243 be a set with positive probability .",
    "then , @xmath31 vanishes on @xmath244 and so @xmath100 is not equivalent to @xmath206 which gives a contradiction . because @xmath245 is non - negative @xmath246 for all @xmath143 and follows @xmath206-almost surely for all @xmath238 .",
    "finally , note that @xmath247 hence the @xmath248 in proposition [ prop : absolutemc ] tend to infinity with probability 1 .",
    "then together with proposition iii.5.10 in @xcite gives .",
    "the result follows immediately from the definition [ def : shotnoise ] together with proposition [ prop : absolutemc ] : under @xmath206 , the representation of course still holds and by proposition [ prop : absolutemc ] states that @xmath249 is a marked point process under @xmath206 .",
    "we will see that additional useful properties , like independent increments are not preserved under the change of measure , such that the specific structures of the shot - noise process under both measures can be substantially different .",
    "recall that we associated with @xmath31 the process @xmath250 which accumulates the jumps of @xmath31 . for tractability reasons",
    "one often considers shot - noise processes driven by a marked point process where @xmath52 has independent increments .",
    "if the increments are moreover stationary and infinitely divisible , the associated process @xmath52 is a lvy process .",
    "we cover both cases in this section .      1 .   if @xmath52 has independent increments under @xmath100 and @xmath206 , then @xmath221 is deterministic .",
    "2 .   if @xmath52 has independent and stationary increments under @xmath100 and @xmath206 , then @xmath221 is deterministic and does not depend on time .",
    "@xmath52 is a process with independent increments ( pii ) , if and only if its compensator is deterministic , see @xcite .",
    "hence , if @xmath52 is a pii under @xmath100 , then @xmath251 is deterministic . by proposition [ prop : absolutemc ]",
    ", @xmath52 has a deterministic compensator under @xmath206 if and only if @xmath252 is deterministic and hence @xmath253 is deterministic .",
    "stationarity is equivalent to @xmath48 being independent of time and so ( ii ) follows analogously .",
    "consider a generic @xmath254-dimensional stochastic process @xmath119 .",
    "then the esscher measure ( @xcite ) is given by the density @xmath255 where @xmath256 is chosen in such a way that @xmath31 is a martingale .",
    "@xcite showed that the esscher measure preserves the lvy property , in a specific context .",
    "it is quite immediate that if applied to a model for stock prices driven by shot - noise processes this property will not hold in general .",
    "@xcite applied the esscher measure to markovian shot - noise processes .",
    "the minimal martingale measure as proposed in @xcite for a certain class of shot - noise processes has been analysed in @xcite .",
    "it can be described as follows : consider the special semimartingale @xmath119 in its semimartingale decomposition @xmath257 where @xmath104 is an increasing process of bounded variation and @xmath82 is a local martingale .",
    "assume that there exists a process @xmath258 which satisfies @xmath259 then the density of the minimal martingale measure with respect to @xmath100 is given by @xmath260 here @xmath261 denotes the doleans - dade stochastic exponential , i.e.  @xmath211 is the solution of @xmath262 . the minimal martingale measure need not exist in general .",
    "from , proceeding as in the proof of proposition 4.1 in @xcite , we obtain that @xmath263 conditions which ensure that the minimal martingale measure is indeed a probability measure can be found in @xcite .    from theorem [ thm3.4 ]",
    "it is clear , that the minimal martingale measure will not preserve independent increments of @xmath52 - a property which makes this measure less tractable for financial applications . in the following section , we propose an alternative to this approach .",
    "we consider the equivalent measure @xmath264 and assume that * ( a1 ) * and * ( a2 ) * hold",
    ". then theorem [ thm : density1 ] gives the relationship between both measures and @xmath31 is again a marked point process under @xmath206 .",
    "the compensator of @xmath32 under @xmath206 is given by @xmath265 in addition , we consider , as in equation a brownian motion @xmath42 , which is ( under @xmath100 ) independent of @xmath31 . by the equivalent change of measure , there exists a market price of ( diffusive ) risk @xmath266 , such that @xmath267 is a @xmath206-brownian motion , see @xcite , theorem iii.3.24 .",
    "we first derive the semimartingale representation of @xmath119 . by it s formula and , @xmath272",
    "as already mentioned , the equivalent change of measure allows to introduce a drift @xmath266 to the brownian motion , such that @xmath273 is a @xmath206-brownian motion .",
    "compensating @xmath32 with the @xmath206-compensator @xmath274 and discounting in the usual way gives the result .",
    "it is apparent that typically there will be many solutions of the drift condition . with a view on tractability it is reasonable to impose that the marked point process @xmath31 has independent ( and possibly stationary ) increments under @xmath100 and @xmath206 . from theorem [ thm3.4 ] it follows that this is the case if the function @xmath221 is deterministic ( and does not depend on time ) .",
    "then , from equation we obtain the following condition on the drift @xmath266 , @xmath275 if there were no jumps , we obtain that @xmath266 coincides with the classical market price of ( diffusive ) risk , @xmath276 .",
    "fix a finite time horizon @xmath277 and assume that @xmath52 has independent and stationary increments , i.e.  @xmath278 where @xmath168 is the distribution of @xmath279 and @xmath280 is the arrival rate of the jumps . assume that @xmath281 is equivalent to @xmath168 , i.e.   @xmath282 and @xmath283",
    ". then an equivalent change of measure is obtained via @xmath284 . in this case , the arrival rate of jumps under @xmath206 is @xmath285 and the jumps sizes are again i.i.d .  with distribution @xmath281 .",
    "assume that @xmath286 and let @xmath266 be such that @xmath287 with @xmath288 . if furthermore the process @xmath289 is a true martingale , then @xmath206 is an equivalent ( local ) martingale measure .",
