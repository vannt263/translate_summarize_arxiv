    "the modified urca bulk viscosity is plotted as a function of normalised baryon density for a range of temperatures in fig 5 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that bulk viscosity due to modified urca process involving nucleons increases with increase in temperature .",
    "hence r - mode instability is effectively suppressed by modified urca bulk viscosity at high temperatures .",
    "the ratio of critical angular velocities to the rotational velocity of the neutron star are plotted as a function of temperature in fig 4 for non - leptonic processes involving antikaons as well as hyperons . in this figure",
    ", we observe that there exists a window of instability for matter with hyperons .",
    "we can interpret that hyperon bulk viscosity damps the r - mode instability at low temperatures , whereas it is effectively suppressed at high temperatures by the bulk viscosity due to the modified urca process involving nucleons .",
    "for @xmath0 condensed matter , we can infer that r - mode instability is damped by nucleonic modified urca process at high temperatures . from the figure ,",
    "it is evident that antikaon bulk viscosity is not an effective mechanism to damp the instability at low temperatures .",
    "the argument is further justified by the fact that the critical velocity curves obtained for both parameter sets k= 240 mev and k = 300 mev are dictated purely by the bulk viscosity due to nucleonic modified urca process .",
    "the bulk viscosity due to antikaon condensation is not sufficient to suppress the r - mode within the temperature range considered here .",
    "hence the instability window is wider for @xmath0 condensed matter , and neutron stars with @xmath0 condensate in its interior could be possible sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the role of @xmath0 condensation on bulk viscosity and r - mode instability has been investigated in this paper .",
    "we have estimated the bulk viscosity coefficient and the corresponding damping time scale due to the non - leptonic process @xmath138 and compared them with those associated with the non - leptonic process @xmath2 involving hyperons .",
    "we have considered a first order phase transition from the nuclear to the antikaon condensed phase , and the equation of state has been constructed using relativistic mean field theoretical models .",
    "we find that the bulk viscosity coefficient in @xmath0 condensed is suppressed by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the nonsuperfluid hyperon bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "we also infer that the antikaon bulk viscosity is unable to damp the r - mode instability unlike hyperon bulk viscosity .",
    "if the instability is not suppressed by the viscosity , the star is forced to lose angular momentum as it cools down via gravitational radiation .",
    "so , r - modes in neutron stars with antikaon condensate in their core are possible candidates of gravitational waves .",
