    "in recent years interacting nano - structures have attracted a great deal of both experimental as well as theoretical interest .",
    "they exhibit a variety of interesting many - body effects .",
    "being equally fascinating and challenging to access theoretically , these systems are subject of a variety of studies ( for a recent review see ref . ) .",
    "an experimentally well controlled setup is given by a quantum dot with only a few electronic degrees of freedom contacted to a certain number of reservoirs .",
    "due to the coulomb repulsion these systems usually feature strong local electron correlations .",
    "a prominent consequence of those is the kondo effect : if a nearly odd number of electrons reside on the quantum dot , spin fluctuations lead to a many - body resonance.@xcite besides of spin fluctuating quantum dot setups a typical model of interest is the interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) , which is dominated by charge fluctuations.@xcite the irlm is given by a single level which is tunnel coupled to reservoirs ( leads ) of spinless fermions . a particle occupying the dot level interacts with the reservoir fermions located close to the dot by coulomb repulsion .",
    "the level is coupled to an external gate , which allows to tune its energy .",
    "here we study the irlm in a minimal transport setup with two reservoirs .",
    "currently the research focus shifts from the equilibrium to the nonequilibrium physics of quantum dots .",
    "one can aim at the bias voltage driven steady - state ( which is usually assumed to exist , see refs .   and )",
    "properties,@xcite or to be even more ambitious at the entire relaxation dynamics from transient to asymptotic.@xcite in the second case it is often assumed that at some time @xmath0 the quantum dot is coupled to the leads and thus relaxation from its initially prepared to its steady state sets in .",
    "in contrast to the well studied equilibrium properties , the nonequilibrium physics remains largely uncharted .",
    "in particular this holds if standard perturbative approaches fail to provide reliable results due to the presence of logarithmically divergent terms as it is the case in the irlm.@xcite for such problems renormalization group ( rg ) approaches@xcite might succeed to describe the system under consideration .",
    "recently a functional rg ( frg ) approach@xcite was developed to tackle the nonequilibrium properties of interacting quantum dots@xcite and tested successfully in its application to the irlm.@xcite combined with studies using alternative methods@xcite this has led to a comprehensive understanding of the bias voltage driven steady state as well as the relaxation dynamics at vanishing temperature of the reservoirs . by far less",
    "is known about the physics at elevated temperatures.@xcite here we aim at closing this gap and present a detailed study of the nonequilibrium irlm with finite reservoir temperatures using frg .",
    "we discuss the steady state behavior as well as the dynamics at arbitrary ( possibly asymmetric ) temperatures in the reservoirs and for a general bias voltage .",
    "our results are approximate , but controlled to leading order in the local electron - electron interaction ; the rg procedure ensures that they are far superior to perturbation theory .",
    "logarithms in the hopping amplitudes are resummed leading to power laws with interaction dependent exponents.@xcite we uncover several interesting , partly surprising , temperature effects .",
    "first , we show analytically that in the steady state the temperatures serve as infrared cutoff scales to the renormalization of the tunnel couplings and as such compete with the other low - energy scales [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : renorm_ana ] ) ] .",
    "this is a rather intuitive finding , but depending on the parameter regime studied , the competition leads to a surprisingly rich variety of power laws in the dependence of the current on the temperatures and the voltage [ see eqs .",
    "( [ noch ] ) to ( [ auchnoch ] ) ] which can certainly not be guessed based on simple power - counting arguments or poor man s rg approaches .",
    "the interaction dependent exponents partly differ from the ones found at vanishing temperature .",
    "our comprehensive study of the finite temperature effects thus reveals a very involved physics of the steady state current not reported on before . in the relaxation dynamics of the current and the occupancy varying the two temperatures allows to individually tune the amplitudes of the characteristic oscillatory terms and to vary the decay rates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : delt ] ) .",
    "crucially this can not be achieved by varying the two tunnel couplings to the left and right leads ; we disentangle the contributions of the temperatures and tunnel couplings to the decay rates . as an essential intermediate step of our analysis we present analytical expressions for the relaxation dynamics of the irlm for vanishing interaction at arbitrary temperatures and bias voltage [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n_free(t ) ] ) and ( [ eq : j_free(t ) ] ) ] . to the best of our knowledge",
    "those were not given before .",
    "we characterize a coherent - to - incoherent transition as the temperature is increased . at this",
    "the long time dynamics changes from being exponential with overlayed oscillations to being purely exponential .",
    "this transition takes place at a critical temperature which depends in a nontrivial way on the interaction strength .",
    "finally , we investigate the time evolution of a current driven by a temperature gradient instead of a bias voltage , which for the irlm constitutes a so far unexplored setup .",

    "needless to say they do not effect the steady state .",
    "we are confident that the finite temperature effects in the relaxation dynamics discussed here equally appear in the presence of initial correlations .",
    "we aim at a limit in which the model is equivalent to the field theoretical irlm.@xcite this is called the scaling limit and can be achieved by coupling the first and third site much stronger to their respective reservoirs than to the central site .",
    "it is then that the first and third dot sites can effectively be incorporated into the leads@xcite resulting in a single level ( central site ) tunnel coupled to and interacting with the reservoirs .",
    "we are interested in the universal physics of the irlm which is independent of the details of the leads band structure .",
