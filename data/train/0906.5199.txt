    "the electrical resistivity @xmath11 exhibits unusual metallic behavior called  bad metal \" , characterized by an absence of suppression in @xmath11 and a very small mean - free pass comparable to lattice constants at high temperatures @xcite . in addition , optical conductivity @xcite and photoemission @xcite studies indicate the enhancements of anomalous electronic states originating from many - body correlation effects . in the mixed compounds",
    "srru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , it is revealed that the substitution of mn for ru suppresses the fm phase , and then induces the c - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase above @xmath12 .",
    "the structural transition from orthorombic to tetragonal symmetries also occurs in connection with the variation of magnetic ground state .",
    "furthermore , the mn substitution changes the characteristic of @xmath11 from metallic to insulating ones .",
    "these features suggest that doping mn into srruo@xmath2 modifies the itinerant electronic states due to the effects of strong correlations between ru 4d and mn 3d electrons , and it significantly affects the magnetic , transport and lattice properties .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the relationship between the electronic states and these properties . to clarify this ,",

    "@xmath34 for pure srruo@xmath2 is roughly proportional to @xmath21 with a finite value for @xmath35 , indicating that the quasi - particles with the fermi - liquid excitations as well as phonons are mainly responsible for @xmath4 .",

    "we attempted to plot the @xmath5 values obtained by fitting in the lower temperature range as well as the @xmath34 data at 2 k in order to check the effect of the @xmath39 component on the present analysis , and confirmed that these quantities exhibit qualitatively the same @xmath13 dependence as that seen in fig .",
    "for comparison , the @xmath13 variations of @xmath11 at 5 k , 20 k and 200 k are also plotted in fig .",
    "2(b ) . the @xmath5 value for pure srruo@xmath2 is estimated to be 33 mj / k@xmath7 mol , which is roughly consistent with the previously reported ones @xcite . in srru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , we have found three features in the @xmath13 variations of @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "first , @xmath5 for @xmath46 is weakly enhanced and shows a maximum at @xmath47 . in this @xmath13 range",
    "the difference in resistivity @xmath48 changes from negative to positive values through the zero at @xmath49 .",
    "secondary , @xmath5 linearly decreases with increasing @xmath13 up to @xmath50 , accompanied by a gradual increase in @xmath11 at low temperatures .",
    "third , @xmath5 for @xmath51 is suppressed to @xmath9 mj / k@xmath7 mol or less , and shows a tendency to be independent of @xmath13 , where the insulating behavior with the strongly enhanced resistivity is observed at 5 k. on the other hand , the debye temperatures estimated from the @xmath52 parameters were @xmath53 for all the @xmath13 range presently investigated .",
    "it is found that the jump anomaly at @xmath19 observed in @xmath4 for @xmath6 is rapidly suppressed and changes into the broad peak for @xmath54 . at the same time , both @xmath55 and @xmath11 increase , while @xmath5 stays in large values .",
    "since the dc magnetization @xcite and ac susceptibility measurements indicate that the fm phase is still stable in this @xmath13 range , these variations are suggested to be attributed to the breakdown of coherency for the itinerant ru 4d electrons generated locally at the mn ions , that is caused by the difference of spin and orbital states and ionic radius between ru@xmath56 and mn@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath13 is increased up to @xmath57 , @xmath11 gradually grows in cooperation with a reduction of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the @xmath39 component is observed in @xmath22 at low temperatures .",
    "these features in @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath22 may be coupled with the magnetic fluctuations enhanced through the competition between fm and afm orders . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath58 dependence in @xmath4 is expected to occur in the usual three - dimensional ferromagnet with the localized spins . on the other hand , @xmath11 at 5 k becomes extremely large and the magnitude of @xmath5 is highly reduced between @xmath59 and 0.6 .",
    "such large variations in @xmath11 and @xmath5 indicate that the electronic state is reconstructed due to the strong hybridization and correlation between the ru 4d and mn 3d electrons in this @xmath13 range , which plays a crucial role in the evolutions of the insulating state , the long - range afm order , and the tetragonal crystal structure .",
    "to clarify the magnetic correlations in the fm and afm states , we plan to perform the neutron scattering experiments in the entire @xmath13 range .",
    "we performed @xmath4 measurements for srru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath14 .",
    "it is observed that doping mn into srruo@xmath2 obscures the jump in @xmath4 associated with the fm transition , and yields unusual development of @xmath5 for @xmath46 . for @xmath60 @xmath5 linearly",
    "decreases with increasing @xmath13 . above @xmath61 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath5 becomes very small , and the shoulder - like anomalies develop in @xmath4 at the onsets of the afm transition .",
    "we discuss the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath11 in the small and intermediate @xmath13 ranges , and suggest that the magnetic and transport properties are affected by the changes in the electronic states induced by both the disorder and correlation effects .",
