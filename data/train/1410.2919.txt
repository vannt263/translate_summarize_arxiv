    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat )  @xcite and thermoacoustic tomography ( tat )  @xcite are based on the thermoacoustic effect : when a material is heated it expands . to perform measurements , a biological object is submerged in water ( or hydroacoustic gel ) and is illuminated with a short electromagnetic pulse that heats the tissue .",
    "the resulting thermoacoustic expansion generates an outgoing acoustic wave , whose pressure is measured on a surface ( completely or partially ) surrounding the object .",
    "next , an inverse problem is solved in order to image the initial acoustic pressure within the object .",
    "this pressure is closely related , in particular , to the blood content in tissues .",
    "blood vessels an cancerous tumors produce much higher pressure ; accordingly , tat and pat are effective for cancer detection and for imaging vasculature in small animals .    during the past decade ,",
    "the mathematical foundations of tat and pat have been well investigated .",
    "significant achievements include , in particular , results on general solvability and stability of the underlying inverse problem  @xcite , explicit inversion formulas  finch04,finch07,kunyansky , kun - cube , nguyen , mxw2,salman , pala , nat12,qsu , and efficient computational methods  norton1,norton2,kun - ser , xuwang04,hkn , burg - exac - appro .",
    "one of the active areas of current research is the so - called quantitative pat ( qpat ) qpat_cla , qpat_pca , qpat_tpc which aims to recover , in addition to the initial pressure , optical properties of the tissue ( e.g. , grneisen coefficient ) and the fluency of electromagnetic radiation as it propagates through inhomogeneous tissue .",
    "however , practically all existing theory of tat / pat is based on the assumption that acoustic waves propagate in free space , and that reflections from detectors and the walls of the water tank can be either neglected or gated out . in the latter case ,",
    "acoustic pressure @xmath2 within the object vanishes quite fast ( in a finite time if the speed of sound is constant within the domain ) . in this case",
    "the inverse problem of tat / pat can be solved by  time reversal \" , i.e. by solving back in time the initial / boundary value problem for the wave equation , with the dirichlet boundary values equal to the measured data ( see , for example , xuwang04,hkn , burg - exac - appro ) .",
    "vanishing ( or sufficient decrease ) of the pressure in finite time @xmath1 allows one to initialize this process by setting @xmath3 and its time derivative @xmath4 to zero within the domain  @xmath5 .",
    "time reversal yields a theoretically exact reconstruction ; it can be implemented in a general closed domain ( even with a variable speed of sound ) using finite differences ; it can also be realized ( for simple domains ) using the method of separation of variables , or , for certain geometries , replaced by equivalent explicit backprojection formulas .",
    "other reconstruction algorithms , although not related directly to time reversal , also require the vanishing of pressure .",
    "however , free space propagation can not always be used as a valid model .",
    "for example , one of the most advanced pat acquisition schemes ( developed by researchers from the university college london  @xcite ) uses optically scanned planar glass surfaces for the detection of acoustic signals .",
    "such surfaces act as ( almost ) perfect acoustic mirrors .",
    "if the object is surrounded by such reflecting detectors ( or by a combination of detectors and acoustic mirrors ) , wave propagation occurs in a resonant cavity .",
    "it involves multiple reflections of waves from the walls , and , if the dissipation of waves is neglected , the acoustic oscillations will never end .",
    "traditional time reversal and other existing techniques are not applicable in this case ; new reconstruction algorithms need to be developed for tat / pat  within resonant cavities .    in @xcite the authors jointly with b. t. cox developed such an algorithm for a rectangular resonant cavity .",
    "that method is based on the fast fourier transform and is computationally very efficient ; however , it is not easily exteneded to other geometries , and it can not handle the case of variable speed of sound .",
    "( other approaches to the inverse problem within resonant cavity include @xcite ; in @xcite an approximate solution is obtained assuming that the sources of sound wave are small inclusions . )    in the present paper we investigate the possibility of solving the inverse problem of tat / pat in a resonant cavity by a modified time reversal technique . here",
    "we understand time reversal in a general sense , without specifying the particular computational technique used to solve the underlying initial / boundary value problem numerically ( although in our simulations we used an algorithm based of finite differences ) . since ( in the idealized setting ) the acoustic energy is preserved within the domain , initializing classical time reversal by setting @xmath6 for any value of @xmath1 would introduce an error of the same order of magnitude as the initial pressure we seek .",
    "instead , we propose a version of time reversal where the boundary data are multiplied by a smooth cut - off function equal to 1 at times @xmath7 close to 0 and vanishing at @xmath8 together with all ( or , at least , several ) derivatives .",
    "this technique , which we call _ gradual time reversal , _ can be initialized by @xmath6 .",
    "as we show in the paper , such an approach yields a good approximation to the sought initial pressure @xmath9 if @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "moreover , under rather generic conditions this approximation converges to @xmath9 in the limit @xmath10    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a precise formulation of the problem .",
    "section [ s : general ] presents the gradual time reversal algorithm and the theorems establishing weak convergence of this technique under some rather generic conditions . in section [ s : particular ] we consider circular and rectangular domains where stronger convergence results can be obtained ; in particular , we prove strong convergence in @xmath11 of gradual time reversal in a circular domain .",
    "several results of numerical simulations are also presented in the latter section to demonstrate the practicality of the present method .",
    "the paper is concluded with an appendix containing an auxiliary theorem on relative spacing of the zeros of bessel functions and their derivatives ( needed in section  [ s : particular ] to analyze convergence of graduate time reversal in a circular domain ) .",
    "the pressure differential @xmath12 within a reverberant cavity is a solution to the following initial / boundary value problem:@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the boundary of the bounded domain @xmath15 formed by the walls of the cavity , @xmath16 is the known speed of sound within the cavity , @xmath17 is the exterior normal to @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the normal derivative of @xmath20 .",
    "the measured data @xmath21 coincides with @xmath22 on a part of the boundary @xmath23 @xmath14 ( @xmath24 may in some cases coincide with the whole @xmath25:@xmath26 our goal is to reconstruct the initial condition @xmath27 from @xmath21 .    in the setting of traditional pat / tat , wave propagation occurs in the whole space ( the reflection from the detectors is assumed to be negligible ) . in the simplest case of 3d wave propagation with constant speed of sound the pressure vanishes in @xmath28 after a finite time @xmath8 .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath29 , the initial pressure @xmath27 can be found by time reversal , i.e. by solving the wave equation in @xmath30 $ ] back in time from @xmath8 to @xmath31  one imposes on such a solution @xmath32 initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 and forces @xmath35 on @xmath36 $ ] to be equal to the measured data @xmath37 then , so - computed values of @xmath38 coincide with @xmath39 this method also works in 2d and/or if the speed of sound is variable ( but non - trapping ) , in the limit of a large @xmath40    however , in the case of perfectly reflecting boundaries we consider here , the energy of the acoustic waves is preserved , and @xmath12 remains of the same order of magnitude for all values of @xmath41 since values of the pressure ( and its time derivative ) inside @xmath42 can not be measured , there is no accurate way of initializing time reversal . simply replacing the unknown values",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 by zero would introduce an error proportional to the energy of the acoustic waves at the time @xmath45 which will propagate toward @xmath46 and create artifacts roughly of the same order of magnitude as @xmath39    below , we show that a good approximation to @xmath27 can be obtained by solving a modified time reversal problem ; we will call this technique _ gradual time reversal_.",
