    "skyrme forces @xcite are widely used for exploration of the ground state and excitations in atomic nuclei . in particular , last years big effort was done in application of these forces to exotic nuclei , nuclear matter and astrophysical problems ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . however , in spite of the impressive progress , skyrme forces still suffer some serious troubles .",
    "for example , there are too many skyrme parametrizations and the forces do require a unification .",
    "further , being successful in description of the nuclear ground states , skyrme forces often fail in a comprehensive treatment of nuclear dynamics ( e.g. no one force can describe equally well both isoscalar and isovector modes , see @xcite for recent discussion ) .",
    "so , the further upgrade of the forces is necessary and nuclear dynamics should play here an important role .    in this connection",
    ", we propose here the analysis of time - odd densities in the skyrme functional and their role in description of electric giant resonances ( gr ) .",
    "time - odd densities ( current @xmath0 , spin @xmath1 , and vector kinetic - energy @xmath2 ) are known to restore galilean invariance of the skyrme functional , violated by velocity - dependent time - even densities ( kinetic - energy @xmath3 and spin - orbital @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore time - odd densities are related to important features of the functional ( effective masses and spin - orbital interaction ) and might play an essential role in its upgrade . in this paper , we discuss time - odd densities in general and , as a particular case , scrutinize the influence of the current density @xmath0 on the isovector e1(t=1 ) and isoscalar e2(t=0 ) gr in a chain of nd isotopes with a=134 - 158 . as compared with the previous studies @xcite , much more nuclei and forces are involved to make the exploration indeed systematic .",
    "we will establish important relations of the gr properties to specific parameters and terms of skyrme forces and , on these grounds , propose a tentative classification of the forces .",
    "the calculations are performed within the self - consistent random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) method with factorized skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "srpa covers both spherical @xcite and deformed @xcite nuclei .",
    "factorization minimizes the computational effort minimized and makes possible the systematic exploration .",
    "the skyrme functional @xcite in the form @xcite @xmath5 includes kinetic , coulomb , pairing and skyrme terms respectively .",
    "expressions for the first three terms are done elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the skyrme part reads @xmath6 this part involves time - even ( nucleon @xmath7 , kinetic - energy @xmath8 , and spin - orbital @xmath9 ) and time - odd ( current @xmath10 , spin @xmath11 , and vector kinetic - energy @xmath12 ) densities , where @xmath13 denotes protons and neutrons . the total densities ( like @xmath14 ) are given in ( [ esky ] ) without the index .",
    "both time - even and time - odd densities follow from the original skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "time - even densities contribute to both ground state and excitations .",
    "time - odd densities affect the excitations as well .",
    "they also influence g.s . of odd and odd - odd nuclei but are irrelevant for g.s . of spin - saturated even - even nuclei .",
    "as was mentioned above , time - odd densities restore galilean invariance of the functional , violated by velocity - dependent time - even densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . just for this reason ,",
    "time - odd densities enter the functional only in the specific combinations with their time - even counterparts .",
    "hence , time - odd densities do not lead to any new parameters .",
    "this is especially useful for even - even nuclei where skyrme parameters , being fixed for the g.s . with implementation of the time - even densities only , can be further applied to nuclear dynamics involving time - odd densities as well .",
    "explicit expressions for time - even and time - odd densities via single - particle wave functions can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is more instructive to write down these densities in terms of the _ basic _ scalar @xmath7 and vector @xmath11 densities @xmath15 which form a general one - body density matrix @xcite @xmath16 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is a pauli matrix and @xmath18 .",
    "then the densities in ( [ esky ] ) read as @xcite @xmath19_{\\vec r = \\vec r ' } , \\quad \\vec \\im_q^{\\mu\\nu}(\\vec r ) = \\frac{1}{2i } [ ( \\vec\\nabla_{\\mu } - \\vec\\nabla'_{\\mu } ) s_q^{\\nu}(\\vec r,\\vec r')]_{\\vec r = \\vec r ' } , \\\\ \\label{bd_ke } \\tau_q(\\vec r)&= & [ \\vec\\nabla \\cdot \\vec\\nabla ' \\rho_q(\\vec r,\\vec r')]_{\\vec r = \\vec r ' } , \\qquad\\qquad\\ ; \\vec t_q(\\vec r ) = [ \\vec\\nabla \\cdot \\vec\\nabla ' ) \\vec s_q(\\vec r,\\vec r')]_{\\vec r = \\vec r ' } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. are reduced to the basic densities ( [ bd ] ) , their momenta ( [ bd_mom ] ) and kinetic energies ( [ bd_ke ] ) .",
    "this presentation clarifies physical sense of the densities in terms of hydrodynamics . besides",
    ", the presentation ( [ bd])-([bd_ke ] ) can be treated as some kind of the gradient expansion up to the second derivatives of the basic densities .",
    "such expansion is obviously useful for non - uniform densities , which is the case for @xmath11 and @xmath7 at the nuclear boundary @xcite .      between time - odd densities ,",
    "the current is most important for electric gr .",
    "indeed , the spin density @xmath11 is mainly relevant for magnetic modes and does not influence electric gr @xcite .",
    "the density @xmath20 can also be neglected as it supplements in ( [ esky ] ) the term @xmath21 which is commonly omitted in most of the skyrme forces .",
    "contribution of @xmath10 to the residual interaction is driven by the variation @xcite @xmath22\\delta(\\vec r ' - \\vec r)\\ ] ] which is fully determined by the terms @xmath23 in the functional ( [ esky ] ) . in these terms",
    ", the current density adjoins the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 responsible for the effective mass .",
    "hence , one may expect the correlation between effective masses and @xmath10 in gr dynamics .    to inspect this correlation , it is convenient to express the terms @xmath23 through isoscalar and isovector densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( the same for @xmath3 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "then the sum of the terms with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is transformed to the form @xmath30 where isoscalar and isovector contributions are decoupled and @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "for the symmetric nuclear matter , the isoscalar effective mass @xmath33 and the sum - rule enhancement factor @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the isovector effective mass ) can be expressed via the new parameters as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the bare nucleon mass and @xmath38 is the density of the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the relations ( [ rel_m * ] ) are illustrated in fig . 1 for the set of skyrme forces used in this paper .",
    "we see that there indeed take place correlations @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the section 4",
    "we will show that @xmath10-impact to e2(t=0 ) and e1(t=1 ) gr is also determined by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this will justify the relation between @xmath10 and effective masses .",
    "the velocity- and spin - dependent densities in the skyrme functional should influence energy - weighted sum rules ( ewsr ) @xcite . for electric modes ,",
    "contributions of spin - dependent densities @xmath43 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to ewsr can be neglected ( though for skyrme forces with a low @xmath44 , like ski3 , influence of the spin - orbital density @xmath43 can be noticeable and reach 7 - 8@xmath45 @xcite ) .",
    "instead the contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath0 are essential .",
    "the former alone results in the effective mass .",
    "however , for isoscalar modes the @xmath3 and @xmath0 contributions fully compensate each other @xcite .",
    "so , if we take @xmath0 into account , then ewsr(t=0 ) again acquires the bare mass @xmath37 and becomes @xmath46 such compensation is not complete for isovector modes @xcite and ewsr(t=1,@xmath47 retains the effective mass .",
    "in particular , @xmath48",
    "the study was performed with the representative set of 8 skyrme forces : skt6 @xcite , sko @xcite , siii @xcite , sgii @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly4 @xcite , sly6 @xcite , ski3 @xcite .",
    "the isovector and isoscalar parameters and characteristics of these forces relevant for our study are exhibited in fig .",
    "1 . we used the srpa approach @xcite in the approximation of 5 input operators of a different radial dependence .",
    "four operators were chosen following prescription @xcite .",
    "for deformed nuclei , the operator @xmath49 was added to take into account the multipole mixing of excitations with the same projection @xmath50 and parity @xmath51 .",
    "direct and exchange coulomb contributions to the residual interaction were taken into account . as was shown in our previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the proper choice of the input operators results in sensitivity of the separable residual interaction to both surface and interior dynamics .",
    "hence high accuracy of the calculations was achieved already for a few separable terms .",
    "factorization of the residual interaction results in drastic simplification of rpa calculations , which allows systematic calculations even for heavy spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "it should be emphasized that factorization in srpa is fully self - consistent and does not lead to additional parameters .",
    "the giant resonances were computed as energy - weighted strength functions @xmath52 smoothed by the lorentz function @xmath53 $ ] with the averaging parameter @xmath54 . in all the calculations @xmath54= 2 mev which was found to be optimal for the comparison with experiment and simulation of various physical smoothing factors .",
    "further , @xmath55 is the matrix element of @xmath56 transition from the ground state to the rpa state @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the rpa eigen - energy .",
    "we directly compute the strength function ( [ eq : strength_function ] ) and hence fully avoid determination of the numerous rpa eigen - states .",
    "this additionally reduces the computation time .",
    "srpa calculations of gr in one nucleus at a familiar laptop take less than one hour , as compared with weeks while using full rpa methods @xcite .",
    "the e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) resonances were computed with the proton and neutron effective charges @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . a large configuration space was used .",
    "e.g. in @xmath62nd we took into account 247 proton and 307 neutron single - particle levels ranging from the bottom of the potential well up to @xmath63 mev .",
    "this results in 13000 and 22000 2-quasiparticle configurations for e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) excitations , respectively , with the energies up to 65 mev .",
    "then , ewsr ( [ ewsr_0 ] ) and ( [ ewsr_1 ] ) are exhausted by 93 - 99@xmath45 and 95 - 97@xmath45 , depending on the force .",
    "nd , calculated with the skyrme forces skt6 , sko , skm@xmath64 , sgii , siii , sly4 , sly6 and ski3 for the cases with ( solid curve ) and without ( dotted curve ) contribution of the time - odd current . the strength is smoothed by the lorentz weight with the averaging @xmath54=2 mev .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are depicted by triangles .",
    ", width=302 ]     mev , is marked the arrows.,width=302 ]",
    "results of the srpa calculations are presented in figs . 2 - 7 .",
    "in figs . 2 and 3 the resonances e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) in @xmath62nd are exhibited for eight skyrme forces .",
    "it is seen that all the forces give in general acceptable agreement with the experiment for e1(t=1 ) resonance , which confirms ability of srpa to describe isovector modes . for e2(t=0 ) we have no experimental data and so give the empirical estimation .",
    "it is seen that all the forces , for exception of skt6 and sko , overestimate the e2(t=0 ) energy and the lower the isoscalar effective mass @xmath44 of the force , the more the overestimation .",
    "figs . 2 and 3",
    "demonstrate that no one force can describe simultaneously e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) .",
    "this is especially the case for the forces with @xmath65 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 compare results obtained with and without @xmath0-contribution to the residual interaction .",
    "the careful inspection of the figures shows that @xmath0-contribution always improves description of e2(t=0 ) but not of e1(t=1 ) .",
    "moreover , the current always results in the down shift for e2(t=0 ) but may cause various shifts for e1(t=1 ) . by comparing figs . 2 and 3 with fig . 1 , one can see that @xmath0-effects in e2(t=0 ) and e1(t=1 ) are fully determined by parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the isoscalar parameter @xmath41 is positive for all the forces and steadily increases from skt6 to ski3 .",
    "hence we have for e2(t=0 ) the shift of the same sign for all the forces and magnitude of the shift rises from skt6 to ski3 .",
    "instead , the isovector parameter @xmath42 is zero and small for skt6 and sko , positive for sgii , siii and skm * and negative ifor skt4 , skt6 and ski3 .",
    "hence we have negligible ( skt6 ) , up ( skm * , sgii , siii ) or down ( skt4 , skt6 , ski3 ) shifts of e1(t=1 ) .",
    "magnitude of the shifts obviously correlates with the absolute values of @xmath42 .",
    "( left small peak ) and @xmath66 ( right big peak ) branches of the resonance are exhibited by dotted curves .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are depicted by triangles .",
    "the right panels compare the full dipole strengths calculated with ( solid curve ) and without ( dotted curve ) current contribution .",
    ", width=302 ]     and @xmath66 branches ( dotted curve ) . ,",
    "width=302 ]    the above analysis allows to separate the skyrme forces into 3 groups , depending on their @xmath41 and @xmath42 parameters . in the first group ( skt6 , sko ) these parameters are zero or small , the effective masses are equal or close to the bare nucleon mass , and the role of the current density is negligible .",
    "these forces usually well describe e2(t=0 ) but fail for e1(t=1 ) .",
    "the second group ( sgii , siii , skm * ) has larger @xmath41 and @xmath42 and therefore smaller effective masses .",
    "what is important , @xmath42 here is positive .",
    "these forces are usually fitted by gr as well ( without taking into account time - odd densities ) .",
    "hence they provide a reasonable description of gr . in this case , adding @xmath0-contribution can even worsen the description , as we see in fig .",
    "these forces violate galilean invariance and so can hardly be considered as a robust basis for the further upgrade .",
    "the third group of the forces ( sly4 , sly6 , ski3 ) is characterized by low effective masses and , what is important , by the negative value of @xmath42 . these forces ( at least sly4 and sly6 ) well describe e1(t=1 ) but essentially overestimate the e2(t=0 ) energy .",
    "no one of the three groups is perfect .",
    "more systematic work with skyrme forces is necessary .",
    "now we turn to systematic exploration of e1(t=1 ) resonance in the chain of nd isotopes .",
    "the calculations were performed with the force sly6 which , following fig.2 and our previous studies @xcite , promises one of the best descriptions of e1(t=1 ) .",
    "4 represents e1(t=1 ) in the isotopes where we have the photoabsorption experimental data .",
    "the isotopes run from the spherical semi - magic @xmath67nd to the axially deformed @xmath62nd discussed above .",
    "the @xmath68 and @xmath66 brunches of the resonance are exhibited to illustrate the magnitude and kind ( prolate ) of the deformation .",
    "the figure demonstrates a remarkable agreement with the experiment for all the nuclei , maybe for exception of @xmath67nd . following right plots of the figure , the current contribution is the same for all the isotopes .",
    "nd and in @xmath69nd .",
    ", width=377 ]    in fig . 5 , nd isotopes with the neutron deficit ( a=134 - 140 ) and excess ( 152 - 158 ) are explored . it is interesting that most of the isotopes are deformed and exhibit prolate shape .",
    "the cartesian quadrupole moments for the isotopes are given in fig .",
    "this figure also shows e1(t=1 ) centroids and widths .",
    "the latter obviously correlate with the magnitude of the deformation",
    ". the resonance energies generally agree with estimation @xmath70 mev .",
    "finally , fig . 7 demonstrates that the current density contribution to e1(t=1 ) ends of the isotope chain is the same as in the middle of the chain ( compare figs . 4 and 7 ) .",
    "so @xmath0-impact is fully determined by the skyrme force and does not depend on the shape and neutron number of the isotope .",
    "since @xmath0-impact is related with the effective masses , this observation sends a promising message that results for time - odd densities and effective masses obtained for standard nuclei may be relevant for exotic areas as well .",
    "the effect of time - odd densities was discussed and examined for the particular case of the current density .",
    "the contribution of this density to e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) giant resonance was explored in the chain of nd isotopes for a representative set of 8 skyrme forces .",
    "the current impact was found to be generally strong and fully determined by the isoscalar and isovector parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the skyrme forces , responsible for the effective masses .",
    "the results obtained allow to classify the skyrme forces into 3 groups , depending on the magnitude and sign of @xmath42 .",
    "our study show that time - odd densities represent a principle ingredient of skyrme forces , responsible for the galilean invariance .",
    "they are closely related with the effective masses and significantly influence nuclear dynamics .",
    "so , time - odd densities can be an important factor for further upgrade and unification of skyrme forces .",
    "the calculations show that the current impact is fully determined by the skyrme force and does not depend on the shape or neutron number of the isotope .",
    "in other words , the impact is the same for standard and exotic nuclei .",
    "this message hints an interesting possibility to explore the time - odd density effects for standard nuclei ( where there are experimental data ) and then to transfer the results to exotic areas .",
