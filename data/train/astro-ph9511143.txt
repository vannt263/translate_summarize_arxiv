    "the inflationary paradigm was originally motivated by its ability to solve the `` initial conditions '' problems associated with the standard model of the big bang  @xcite .",
    "however it was quickly realised that an inflationary epoch would also produce primordial density perturbations and may be able to explain both the observed clustering of galaxies and the ( then unobserved ) anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .    insisting that inflation produces the observed spectrum of primordial perturbations is a more demanding requirement than merely providing the approximately 60 e - foldings of inflation needed to solve the various initial conditions problems",
    "consequently , the focus of much present work is on the density perturbation spectra produced by different inflationary models .",
    "this is particularly true of slow - rolling inflation , in which the scalar field evolves continuously .",
    "the consistency of slow - rolling inflation can be directly tested through cmb observations @xcite , and in principle the potential can be reconstructed @xcite , opening a window into a gut - scale particle physics .    in order to do this , accurate calculations of the perturbation spectra produced during inflation are required .",
    "stewart and lyth @xcite give a second order calculation of the perturbation spectra for a general potential .",
    "exact scalar field cosmologies have been widely studied , in for instance , @xcite , but power - law inflation @xcite remains the only only inflationary model for which the perturbation spectrum has been obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new scalar field cosmology for which the spectrum of scalar perturbations can be obtained analytically .",
    "this solution therefore provides a second example of a slow - rolling inflationary cosmology with an exact perturbation spectrum . while the perturbations produced are not within the parameter range permitted by observation , this model extends our understanding of the problem and can be used to probe the validity of the approximation schemes used to tackle the more general problem .",
    "for a scalar field , @xmath0 with potential @xmath1 in a spatially flat robertson - walker metric we have @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor and @xmath4 , is the hubble parameter . from these equations",
    "we obtain the equation of motion for the scalar field , @xmath5    as is often the case when dealing with exact scalar field cosmologies it will be useful to parametrise the motion in terms of the field , @xmath0 @xcite . from equations  ( [ hsqrd ] ) and  ( [ adda ] )",
    "we deduce that @xmath6 , leading to @xmath7 where a dash denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "if we specify @xmath8 we can immediately obtain the corresponding potential and evolution .",
    "the equation governing the evolution of scalar perturbations with wavenumber @xmath9 is @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the conformal time and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , we have the boundary conditions @xmath13 which guarantees that the perturbation behaves like a free field well inside the horizon and is fixed at superhorizon scales .    in practice , however , we are interested in the spectrum @xmath14 and index , @xmath15 which are given by @xmath16 the form of equation  ( [ mode1 ] ) can be simplified by defining @xmath17 , and @xmath18 \\frac{d u_k}{d \\eta } +     k^2 u_k = 0 .",
    "\\label{mode2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now turn our attention to the particular case where @xmath19 is a constant , which is equivalent to demanding that the term in square brackets in equation  ( [ mode2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "in order to construct a model with an exact perturbation spectrum we demand that @xmath19 is constant . this is equivalent to requiring that @xmath20 satisfy the differential equation @xmath21 which has the solution @xmath22 the values of the integration constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary , but we can set @xmath25 without loss of generality , as it can be recovered by making a linear shift of the field . from equations  ( [ vflatphi ] )",
    "to  ( [ tflatphi ] ) we derive the corresponding exact scalar field cosmology , @xmath26 , \\label{texact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the exponential integral function .",
    "the conformal time is @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{etaexact}\\ ] ] at late times , or as @xmath0 goes to zero , the conformal time tends to a constant value .",
    "the cosmological properties of this solution are quickly derived .",
    "the potential , shown in figure  1 , is not bounded below . however , for this solution the total energy density is always positive as the kinetic energy is very large in the region where @xmath29 is large .",
    "the motion is not inflationary at all times . by definition",
    ", inflation occurs when @xmath30 , or when @xmath31 , where @xmath32 thus inflation occurs only when @xmath33 .",
    "if this model was to produce _ all _ the 60 e - foldings of inflation needed to solve the initial conditions problems in the standard model of cosmology , @xmath0 must evolve to be unreasonably close to zero in view of the typical size of the perturbations in the field .",
    "this exact inflationary model is similar to one previously discussed by barrow @xcite , and can clearly be generalised in a number of ways . in particular , taking the hubble parameter to be of the form @xmath34 gives a similar potential .",
    "however , in this paper we will focus on the case where @xmath19 is constant , which requires @xmath20 to have the form of equation  ( [ hsoln ] ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the spectrum of scalar perturbations produced by this model .",
    "the solution to equation  ( [ mode2 ] ) is simple , as the first derivative term drops out and we find @xmath35 for the growing mode , after we have imposed the boundary conditions . in terms of the conformal time",
    ", this solution has the special property that the perturbations always evolve according to the equation of motion for a free field .",
    "however , since @xmath36 tends to a constant value @xmath37 is essentially fixed at super - horizon scales , as we would expect .",
    "we can immediately calculate the spectral index for these perturbations , giving @xmath38 note that this value is both exact and independent of @xmath0 .",
    "a flat , or scale - free , spectrum has an index of unity .",
    "hence this spectrum is `` blue '' as it possesses more power at large values of @xmath9 , or small scales .",
    "astrophysical constraints , both from the cmb data @xcite and bounds on the density of small primordial black holes @xcite rule out such a large value of @xmath39 in the physical universe . the spectrum of the tensor , or gravitational , perturbations has not been obtained exactly .",
    "however when @xmath40 , the expansion is roughly exponential and we therefore expect the tensor perturbation spectrum to be flat .",
    "this model can be used to probe the accuracy of the first and second order expressions for the scalar perturbation spectra . since",
    "this exact result pertains to a particular potential it does not provide a definitive test , but the results are reassuring . written in terms of derivatives of @xmath8",
    "the perturbation spectrum is  @xcite @xmath41 the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the first and second order values , respectively , and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the euler - mascheroni constant .    in figure",
    "2 the first and second order results are plotted for the values of @xmath0 during which this solution is inflationary .",
    "we can immediately see that the second order result gives a much more accurate estimate of the index than the first order value , remaining within approximately 10% of the exact value when @xmath44 .",
    "the departures from slow roll for this potential are large , even though the expansion of the scale factor is approximately exponential .",
    "the exact scalar field cosmology developed in this paper adds another specimen to the collection of analytic inflationary models that have been discovered over the last decade .",
    "unusually , however , the mode equation for the scalar perturbations can also be solved , making this only the second model ( after power - law inflation ) for which the exact value of the spectral index of the scalar perturbations is known .",
    "the spectrum has an index of 3 , which is significantly different from the scale free value of unity , and is too large to satisfy the observational bounds on the primordial spectrum .",
    "however , this solution is useful as it can be used to test approximate calculations of the spectral indices for slow - rolling inflation .",
    "since the slow - rolling conditions are badly violated by this model the test is a comparatively stringent one , and the first order expression does not give good agreement with the exact result .",
    "however , the second order expression for the scalar index is able to match the exact result to within 10% over most of the inflationary epoch , a result which will add confidence to its use in more realistic situations .",
