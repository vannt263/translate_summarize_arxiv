    "it is well known that the radiation fields and stellar winds of massive stars can drastically affect the physical conditions , structure , and chemistry of the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) from which they formed .",
    "it is also thought that massive stars are at least partly responsible for triggering further star formation within a gmc .",
    "the details of this interaction , however , are not well understood and additional detailed study of massive star - forming regions is needed .    the carina nebula is a spectacular star - forming region containing some of the most massive stars known in our galaxy .",
    "the two most influential clusters of the nebula , trumpler  14 and 16 ( hereafter tr  14 and tr  16 ) , contain 6 o3 type stars ( feinstein 1995 ) .",
    "tr  16 also contains the well - known star @xmath2  car .",
    "the nebula is part of a gmc complex that extends over 130 pc with a mass in excess of 5@xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath5@xcite .",
    "it consists of two main emission regions identified as the northern and southern clouds ( , , and ) .",
    "the region between these two clouds is centred on the keyhole nebula and here the molecular gas exists in several dense clumps of typical mass 10 m@xmath5  ( and ) .",
    "thermal radio continuum emission has been detected over a large part of the nebula , with two bright concentrations named car  i and car  ii @xcite .",
    "these two @xmath1  regions are ionized by tr  14 and tr  16 respectively , and contain bright ionization fronts ( and ) .",
    "car  i is located in the northern part of the nebula and overlaps with both the optical nebulosity and the western dust lane .",
    "car  ii is located towards the keyhole nebula and traces the bright optical emission filaments present in this region .",
    "the large - scale dynamics measured across the nebula are extremely complex , and some interpretations involve merging spiral arms @xcite , rotating neutral clouds @xcite or old @xmath1  regions @xcite . on a smaller scale ,",
    "the dynamics of the ionized gas in the vicinity of car  ii are indicative of an expanding shell that is likely the result of the strong stellar winds from the stellar members of tr  16 , in particular @xmath2  car ( , and ) .",
    "the picture emerging for the carina nebula is one in which the extreme radiation flux and stellar winds from tr  14 and tr  16 have carved out large cavities within the gmc @xcite .",
    "the close proximity of tr  14 to the northern molecular cloud suggests that such a process is still taking place here .",
    "evidence for ongoing star - formation in the carina nebula is scarce .",
    "only a small number of sites have been identified in the southern molecular cloud ( and ) and little is known about the processes taking place in the northern cloud .    in this paper",
    "we investigate further the ionized gas associated with car  i and car  ii .",
    "we have made observations of h110@xmath0 ( 4.874  ghz ) recombination - line emission and the corresponding 4.8-ghz continuum emission using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "these new data not only support the presence of expanding gas shells , but also provide details on the small - scale distribution of the ionization fronts and reveal continuum emission sources resembling compact @xmath1  regions .    hereafter we will adopt the popular view ( e.g. , and ) that tr  14 and tr  16 are at a common distance of 2.2 @xmath6 0.2 kpc and that tr  14 is younger ( @xmath7  yr ) than tr  16 ( @xmath8  yr ) .",

    "a cycle of twenty - minute observations of each pointing centre bracketed by 3-minute observations of a phase calibrator , either pks  1215 - 457 or pks  1039 - 47 , was used .",
    "these calibrators were also used to calibrate the spectral bandpass .",
    "the flux was calibrated by observing pks  1934 - 638 ( the atca primary calibrator ) , for which values of 5.73  jy at 4.874  ghz and 5.83  jy at 4.8  ghz were adopted .",
    "data were edited and calibrated according to standard techniques using the software package miriad ( see and references therein ) .    the continuum emission associated with @xmath2  car varied both in amplitude and spatial extent throughout the 1996 observations ( see ) . in our data we detected a flux density variation between 0.1 and 0.2  jy  beam@xmath9 which affected the de - convolution of the car  ii data .",

    "the previously detected h109@xmath0 emission profile centred on car  i has one single component , centred at a velocity of @xmath21  kms@xmath9  @xcite .",

    "the line - to - continuum values for each component vary between 0.02 and 0.08 , with no clear spatial trend for the relative values of each component pair .",
    "values for the linewidths of each component in car  ii vary between 11 and 34  kms@xmath9 , with an average value of 24  kms@xmath9 .",

    "narrow linewidths of are frequently detected in recombination - line studies and are understood to arise from pdrs ( e.g.  ) .",
    "this may be the case for the narrow component , at , from region 4 .",
    "the broad component arising from the same region at may be the result of broadening mechanisms such as electron impacts and non - thermal broadening .",
    "in this case , a linewidth of @xmath24  kms@xmath9  corresponds to a non - thermal component of @xmath25  kms@xmath9  ( using equation 3 of with and ) .",
    "all the line profiles are likely to contain contributions from non - thermal motions , and possibly from pdrs .",
    "it is not clear why region 4 , which represents a small region in car  ii - n , is the most affected .",
    "individual data points of h@xmath0 and [ nii ] emission taken by also show strong line splitting in the vicinity of car  ii . the h109@xmath0 emission profile centred on car  ii has two components with central velocities of @xmath2033 and @xmath208  kms@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the velocity separation is consistent with the h110@xmath0 value of 24  kms@xmath9  whereas the central velocities are offset by 3  kms@xmath9 .",
    "this offset is likely to be caused by the different regions over which each profile was obtained .",
    "it has been noted in w3(oh ) however , that the centre velocity of a radio recombination line increases with the frequency of the transition .",
    "this has been explained by optical depth effects in a dense and expanding ionized gas shell ( see and references therein ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the car  ii emission profiles , is the presence of two faint and narrow components centred near velocities of @xmath20120 and @xmath20157  kms@xmath9  which are discussed further in section  [ hec ] .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian fits to the emission line profiles listed in table  [ h110_params ] have been used to obtain values for the lte electron temperature ( @xmath26 ) according to equation  22 of . in the case of car",
    "ii , only a single measurement for @xmath26 was obtained ( from the single - peaked profile of region 1 ) .",
    "a typical value of 0.1 was taken for the fractional helium abundance ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the measured line - to - continuum values ( primarily caused by the negative continuum emission ` bowl ' ) lead to an uncertainty in @xmath26 of typically",
    ". values range between 2700  k and 7700  k and are consistent with the single value of 6@xmath28  k derived from the h109@xmath0 profile @xcite .",
    "the arc - shaped emission of car  i - e coincides remarkably well with a semicircular bright - rimmed optical feature .",
    "such a coincidence was also noted by .",
    "it was interpreted as a ionization front bordering dense molecular gas associated with the dust lane . at the edge of the dust lane",
    "there is a strong co emission concentration between @xmath2035 and @xmath2021  kms@xmath9  which is likely to be a dense clump in the front face of the molecular cloud ( see ) .",
    "it is adjacent to both car  i - e and the bright - rimmed optical feature . the way in which car  i - e curves around the dense molecular clump is suggestive of a strong interaction taking place between the molecular and ionized gas .",
    "car  i - w is located further into the dust lane and is adjacent to another strong co concentration between @xmath2020 and 0 kms@xmath9 .",
    "this may be a dense clump at the back face of the molecular cloud and which car  i - w curves around .",
    "the results presented here clearly support the view that car  i - e and car i - w are strong ionization fronts which are adjacent to dense parts of a molecular cloud .",
    "their curved morphology supports the currently held view that these ionization fronts are from tr  14 .",
    "furthermore , by combining the results from a photometric study of 475 stellar members of tr  14 by @xcite with the stellar energy distributions modeled by , the total ionizing luminosity of tr  14 is estimated to be @xmath29  l@xmath5(see ) .",
    "the bulk of this luminosity is centered at the core of tr  14 , approximately 3 arcmin from the position of car  i - e and 5 arcmin from the position of car  i - w .",
    "assuming zero projection to tr  14 and adopting 1.5 arcmin in extent for both car  i - e and car  i - w , yields values of @xmath30 photon s@xmath9 and @xmath31 photon s@xmath9 arriving at car  i - e and car  i - w , respectively .",
    "these values are of the order of those derived from the measured 4.8-ghz continuum fluxes in table  [ h110_table1 ] .",
    "the two detected compact @xmath1  regions are located towards the dust lane ( and associated molecular cloud ) .",
    "if they are early type bo and o9.5 stars , as their radio fluxes suggest ( see table  [ contparam ] ) , then this is the first evidence of ongoing star formation within the northern cloud of carina nebula .",
    "these sources are offset from the main tr  14 cluster and are in close proximity to the interface between the ionization fronts and the molecular cloud .",
    "they may be examples of shock induced star formation , first discussed by .",
    "infrared studies would be useful to establish if indeed the two detected compact @xmath1  regions are young embedded stars .",
    "the molecular gas appears to wrap around most of car  i suggesting that car  i may be carving out an ionized gas cavity at the edge of the gmc .",
    "the h110@xmath0 line data described here do not exhibit the characteristic profiles of expansion ( with two peaks ) .",
    "however , this does not necessarily rule out expansion .",
    "instead it could imply that the expansion velocity is smaller than the sound speed of the ionized gas . in this case",
    "the linewidth would be dominated by the thermal component .",
    "studies have shown that observed linewidths are very broad for ultra - compact @xmath1  and quite narrow for more extended ones ( see ) .",
    "these results imply that the contribution from turbulent motions decays with time .",
    "such behaviour is to be expected for the simple evolution of an expanding @xmath1  region . under this premise , the single profiles of car  i are consistent with an age of @xmath32  yr .",
    "contrary to what is seen in car  i , the strongest continuum emission features have bright optical emission counterparts .",
    "this was noted previously in other studies ( and ) .",
    "however , the higher - resolution data shown here illustrate that this similarity extends to the scale of the small emission knots and filaments , and in particular to the narrow ring feature , car  ii - n .",
    "the origin of car  ii - n remains unknown .",
    "have suggested that it is part of an expanding shell , powered by a star or stars within it .",
    "this idea was based on a bright peak of far - infrared emission which is located within the ring @xcite .",
    "however , the study by reveal strong [ oiii ] emission outside the ring while strong [ nii ] emission is associated with the interior .",
    "these results are consistent with the scenario proposed by in which car  ii is excited externally by the numerous nearby stars of tr  16 , and the ring is an ionization front that is enveloping warm molecular gas .",
    "a small molecular clump ( clump 5 ) has been detected by in the vicinity of the emission ring .",
    "however , this clump is likely to be situated in front of the nebula , and removed from the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the ionizing luminosity of tr  16 can be attributed to @xmath2  car alone ( see ) . using a stellar radius of @xmath33  cm @xcite and an effective temperature of @xmath34  000  k @xcite yields a value of @xmath35 photons s@xmath9 leaving @xmath2  car . assuming zero projection and adopting a separation of 4.5 arcmin and an extent of 1.5 arcmin for car  ii - n",
    ", the estimated number of ionizing photons arriving at this region from @xmath2  car is @xmath36 photons s@xmath9 .",
    "this value is sufficient to explain the value determined from the 4.8-ghz continuum measurement ( see table  [ h110_cont_l ] ) , supporting the idea that car  ii - n is an ionization front originating from @xmath2  car .",
    "the origin of the continuum emission bar ( car  ii - e and car  ii - w ) remains a puzzle .",
    "its sharp southern boundary , which faces @xmath2  car , may be a result of depleted gas . for its 4.8-ghz continuum flux to be consistent with ionization by @xmath2  car , a projection angle of @xmath37  deg",
    "needs to be invoked .",
    "a number of position - velocity traces were taken across different parts of car ii .",
    "combined with the previously discussed channel maps and line profiles , the velocity trends are consistent with two main emission components at red - shifted ( @xmath205 to @xmath38  kms@xmath9 ) and blue - shifted ( @xmath39 to @xmath40  kms@xmath9 ) velocities .",
    "these two components could be indicative of separate @xmath1  regions at different distances along the line of sight .",
    "however , in this chance coincidence , we would expect the line separation to remain constant across the source .",
    "our results however , show that this is not the case and a maximum line separation of 30  kms@xmath9  is evident towards the central part of car ii .",
    "suggest an expanding shell centred on @xmath2  car with an expansion velocity greater that 25  kms@xmath9 .",
    "although our results do not rule out the possibility of expansion from @xmath2  car , they are more consistent with expansion from the location defined by region 2 , with an expansion velocity of 15  kms@xmath9 .    given the extreme conditions that car  ii is exposed to as a result of its close proximity to both tr  14 and tr  16 , a more favorable scenario could be that there are two ( or more ) expanding shells in the vicinity of car  ii , of which the two main h110@xmath0 velocity components are fragments .",
    "a number of the h110@xmath0 emission profiles towards car  ii contain faint components at velocities close to @xmath20157  kms@xmath9  and @xmath20120  kms@xmath9  ( see table  [ h110_params ] ) .",
    "region 5 in car  ii defines the area over which the additional components are detectable .",
    "this region corresponds to the southern part of car  ii - e and car  ii - w ( with main h110@xmath0 components at @xmath207 and @xmath2037 kms@xmath9 ) .",
    "the narrow linewidth of the component at @xmath20157  kms@xmath9  is typical of that for c110@xmath0 emission .",
    "carbon emission is commonly detected towards bright @xmath1  regions and is thought to arise from pdrs ( e.g. and ) . in this case",
    "the central velocity of the component translates to @xmath207 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the broader linewidth of the component at @xmath20120  kms@xmath9  is consistent with he 110@xmath0 emission and translates to a velocity of 2 kms@xmath9 .",
    "however , this velocity is considerably offset from the main hydrogen lines .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the peak intensities is greater than the typical interstellar abundance value of 0.1 .",
    "it is worth noting that interstellar absorption lines toward individual stars in the carina nebula have velocity features extending over 550 kms@xmath9(e.g and ) .",
    "there are three main velocity regimes : a cool foreground gas component at @xmath41  kms@xmath9 ; a gas component at @xmath42  kms@xmath9 ; and a very high velocity gas component at @xmath43  kms@xmath9 .",
    "the gas component close to @xmath44  kms@xmath9  is thought to be associated with car  ii .",
    "models for the high - velocity gas component are not well established .",
    "this gas is likely to be from isolated , energetic wind - driven structures around individual hot stars @xcite .",
    "one explanation for emission components at the two extreme negative velocities is that they represent h110@xmath0 emission coming from these wind - driven structures .",
    "further data are required in order to better identify their origin .",
    "we have obtained h110@xmath0 recombination - line and 4.8-ghz continuum data on the two bright radio sources in the carina nebula  car  i and car  ii .",
    "car  i contains two bright emission arcs , car  i - e and car  i - w .",
    "the velocities of the ionized gas associated with each arc are @xmath45  kms@xmath9and @xmath46  kms@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "their ionizing fluxes are consistent with ionization fronts originating from tr  14 .",
    "car  i - e envelops a dense fragment at the front of the northern molecular cloud and the new structure revealed in car  i - w implies that it envelops a dense molecular fragment in the middle or back of the northern cloud .",
    "car  i may be expanding and carving out a cavity within the northern molecular cloud . the electron temperatures for car  i range between 3000  k and 8000  k. two compact @xmath1regions have been identified with fluxes that correspond to ionization by single o9.5 and bo - type stars . if this is the case , then this is the first evidence of ongoing star formation in the northern cloud .",
    "both sources are situated in the vicinity of the ionization arcs and could be examples of triggered star formation .    unlike car",
    "i , there is a close resemblance between the main components of car  ii and the bright features of the optical nebulosity , in particular the prominent ring - like structure .",
    "the kinematics of car  ii are very complicated .",
    "they are consistent with expansion from at least two different points .",
    "there are three main emission components  car  ii - n is in the shape of an arc and forms more than half of the ring ; and car  ii - e and car  ii - w form a linear or bar - like feature that extends in the northeast  southwest direction .",

    "the ionizing fluxes of these three components are consistent with ionization fronts originating from the massive stellar members of tr  16 , in particular @xmath2  car .",
    "it is not clear what is responsible for their striking shapes : car  i - n may be enveloping a dense molecular cloud and car  ii - e and car  ii - w may be bordering a region in the vicinity of @xmath2  car that has been depleted of gas .",
