    "first we need the concept of a reusable secure carrier @xcite , . a bell state like @xmath0 shared between alice(a ) and",
    "bob(b ) can be used as a reusable secure carrier between two parties as follows .",
    "alice entangles a qubit @xmath1 by the action of a cnot gate @xmath2 ( acting on the qubit @xmath3 and controlled by @xmath4 ) , which produces a state like @xmath5 at the destination bob disentangles the qubit by a cnot operation @xmath6 , leaving the carrier in its original state for reusing . during the transmission the qubit has been disguised in a highly mixed state .",
    "+ any of the bell states [ bells ] |^_ab = ( |00|11)_ab,|^_ab = ( |01|10)_abcan be used as a carrier .",
    "+ for three parties @xcite , a carrier shared between alice(a ) , bob(b ) and charlie(c ) can be a ghz state like @xmath7 or an even parity state like @xmath8    throughout @xcite , the comment @xcite and the present reply the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 are used for the quibts shared by , or the local operators acted by , alice , bob and charlie respectively , while the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath11 are used for the qubits sent to bob and charlie respectively . +",
    "it was shown in @xcite that by suitable local operations , alice can send a qubit @xmath12 to bob and charlie , by entangling it to the above carriers ( hence hiding it from eavesdroppers ) . in order to share the secret between bob and charlie ,",
    "half of the bits ( the bits in the odd rounds ) were sent to bob and charlie , as states of the form @xmath13 which they could read without the help of each other and the other half ( the bits in the even rounds ) were sent to them in the form @xmath14 which they could use to decipher the value of @xmath12 only by their cooperation .",
    "note that @xmath15 .    in order to be able to send both types of states in disguised form",
    ", alice needs to use two types of carriers , namely the @xmath16 carrier for the states @xmath17 and the @xmath18 carrier for the states @xmath19 .",
    "the interesting point is that the two types of carriers are transformed to each other at the end of every round by the local action of hadamard gates by the three parties , due to the following easily verified property      an important property which requires careful attention is that the carrier alternates between the above two forms regardless of the value of the qubit @xmath12 which has been sent to bob and charlie by alice .",
    "+ in @xcite the authors show that in the second round where a qubit say @xmath21 has been encoded as @xmath22 and entangled to the carrier @xmath18 , bob ( assuming that he has access to the channel between alice and charlie ) can intercept the qubit 2 sent to charlie ( assuming that he has access to the channel used between alice and charlie ) and perform a suitable unitary operation @xmath23 , on the state of the carrier and the two bits @xmath3 and @xmath11 , to split the carrier @xmath18 to two simple carriers of the type [ bells ] .",
    "this process is shown schematically in figure ( [ split ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath24 the qubit sent by alice in the second round .",
    "bob keeps this qubit for himself and denotes it hereafter by @xmath25 , since it is now in possession of bob and plays a role as part of his new carriers . + it is important to note that the pattern of entanglement splitting depends on the value of this qubit @xmath24 as follows ( equation 3 of the comment ) :      as it stands in @xcite , this does not harm the cheating strategy of bob , since as mentioned before any of the bell states can be used as a carrier between two parties .",
    "he then uses the above two pairs of entangled states for retrieving the qubits sent by alice on his own and sending counterfeit qubits to charlie in a clever way so that to avoid detection after public announcement of subsequence of the bits . +",
    "what is crucial in this attack is that bob acts by hadamard gates on his qubits @xmath27 and @xmath25 along with alice and charlie who are doing the same thing at the end of each round . in this way",
    "he almost maintains the pattern of the new carriers , which he has created in the second round , between himself and the other two parties .",
    "+ the reason for `` almost '' is that the hadamard operations act as follows ( equation 4 of the comment ) :        at first sight one may argue that alice and charlie who are no longer entangled after bob s trick , can detect their new disentangled situation ( i.e. by testing a bell inequality ) and hence detect bob s cheating .",
    "however this test requires statistical analysis which requires many measurements . in each measurement the carrier collapses and will not be usable anymore .",
    "being in conflict with the whole idea of reusable carrier , we do not follow this line of argument .",
    "instead we modify the protocol in a way which prevents bob s from entanglement splitting .",
    "+ to this end we note that the operator @xmath31 is not the only operator which transforms the carriers @xmath16 and @xmath18 into each other .",
    "consider a unitary operator of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary parameter @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath35 this is the usual hadamard operator .",
    "a simple calculation shows that a generalization of ( [ three ] ) is possible in the following form @xmath37 provided that @xmath38 therefore in the modified protocol alice , bob and charlie act alternatively by the operators @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and their inverses , on the qubits in their possession .",
    "the angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be announced publicly at the beginning of the protocol .",
    "we now show that after entanglement splitting , bob can not retain his pattern of carriers by any operator @xmath44 which he acts on his qubits @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "we need the following + * proposition * : + * a : * the only operator @xmath45 which in conjunction with @xmath46 leaves invariant the state @xmath29 is the operator @xmath47 .",
    "+ * b : * the only operator @xmath45 which in conjunction with @xmath46 transforms the state @xmath48 into @xmath49 is the operator @xmath50 , where @xmath51 means transpose . + * proof : * the proof is simply straightforward calculations .",
    "we highlight the basic steps .",
    "consider part * a*. we want an operator @xmath44 such that @xmath52 where we use @xmath53 as an abbreviations of @xmath54 and so forth .",
    "acting on both sides by @xmath55 we obtain @xmath56    we now rearrange both sides to the convenient form @xmath57 and effect the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 on the right hand side by using ( [ ha ] ) . after comparing both sides in the basis @xmath60 we arrived at the stated assertion , namely that @xmath47 . +",
    "similar reasoning proves part @xmath27 .",
    "+ we now come to our main conclusion .",
    "bob , being among the original legitimate parties knows the values of the angles , @xmath61 .",
    "however in order to scape detection he has to apply either the operator @xmath62 or @xmath63 at the end of each round .",
    "however his choice depends on the value of the second bit which he does not know . without this knowledge",
    "he can not retain the pattern of fraud carriers which he has constructed between him and the other two parties .",
    "this then introduces errors in half of the bits sent by alice and received by him and charlie , which in subsequent public announcement of substrings of bits reveals his cheating .",
    "incidentally we note that the equality @xmath64 holds only for @xmath65 , that is for the ordinary hadamard gate .",
