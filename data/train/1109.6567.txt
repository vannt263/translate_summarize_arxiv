    "directed percolation ( dp ) , introduced in 1957 by broadbent and hammersley @xcite , is a fundamental model in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and represents the most common dynamic universality class @xcite .",
    "dp has a very wide application , including flow in a porous rock in a gravitational field , forest fires , epidemic spreading , and surface chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "the dp process can be illustrated in the simple example of bond dp on the square lattice . along the horizontal ( vertical ) edges of the lattice",
    ", the propagation occurs in a particular direction only , e.g. , toward the right ( the up ) . frequently , the preferred spreading direction is termed `` temporal , '' and the perpendicular one is called `` spatial ; '' the two - dimensional dp is thus often called `` ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dp . ''",
    "the dp process has two distinct phases : the inactive phase for small occupation probability @xmath10 where the propagation quickly dies out , and the active phase for large @xmath11 . between these two phases , a transition occurs at @xmath12 . as the threshold @xmath12 is approached , the temporal ( @xmath13 ) and the spatial ( @xmath14 ) correlation lengths diverge but with distinct critical exponents : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the anisotropy is characterized by the so - called dynamic exponent @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath19 , defined as the probability that a randomly selected site can generate an infinite cluster , becomes non - zero and its behavior can be described as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 another critical exponent . below the upper critical dimensionality @xmath22 with @xmath23 , the three independent critical exponents , @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and @xmath25 , are sufficient to describe the dp universality class .",
    "while analytical results are scarce for dp , even in @xmath26 dimensions , approximation techniques like series expansion @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite have produced fruitful results . moreover , after a great deal of efforts , experimental realization of the dp process has been achieved @xcite in nematic liquid crystals , where the dp transition occurs between two turbulent states .",
    "analogously , standard isotropic percolation ( ip ) @xcite is a fundamental model in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "ip has attracted extensive research attention both in the physical and the mathematical communities , and the critical behavior is now well understood . due to the isotropy , there exists only one spatial correlation length , which scales as @xmath27 near @xmath12 .",
    "numerous exact results are now available in two dimensions ( 2d ) . for bond ip on the square lattice",
    ", the self - duality yields the threshold @xmath28",
    "@xcite ; the values of @xmath12 are also exactly known for bond and site percolation on several other lattices  @xcite , or have been determined to a high precision  @xcite . thanks to conformal field theory and coulomb gas theory  @xcite , the critical exponents @xmath29 and @xmath21 are also exactly known as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .        in this work , we introduce a generalized percolation propagation process that contains dp and ip as two special cases . on a given lattice , each edge is assigned to one of the three possible states : occupied by a directed bond along a particular direction , occupied by a directed bond against the particular direction , or unoccupied .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ conf ] ( a ) , and the associated probabilities are denoted as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively . as a result , the percolation process has two main growth directions . for @xmath35 , the symmetry between the two opposite directions is restored , and the system reduces to standard bond ip . in the limiting case @xmath36 or @xmath37 , propagation against or along the particular direction is forbidden , and one has standard dp .",
    "we call this percolation model with two main growth directions _ biased directed percolation _ ( bdp ) .",
    "we note that the bdp model is described by the field - theoretic equation in  @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises : in between standard dp and ip , what is the nature of phase transition for bdp ?",
    "for later convenience , we replace parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 by two new variables as @xmath38 the parameter @xmath10 is the average bond - occupation probability ( irrespective of the bond direction ) , and @xmath3 accounts for the anisotropy .",
    "dp corresponds to @xmath39 or 1 , while @xmath4 is for ip .    in this work ,",
    "extensive monte carlo simulations are carried out for bdp in two and three dimensions .",
    "a dimensionless ratio is defined to locate the percolation threshold .",
    "the data are analyzed by finite - size scaling , and the critical exponents are determined .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the asymmetric perturbation due to @xmath9 is relevant near ip , and thus that as long as @xmath40 , bdp is in the dp universality class .",
    "these results further raise the following questions , remaining to be explored .",
    "for ip , is the asymmetric renormalization exponent a `` new '' critical exponent or related in some way to the known ones like @xmath29 and @xmath21 ?",
    "particularly , can this `` new '' exponent be exactly obtained in two dimensions ?",
    "if so , what is the exact value ?",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the bdp model , the sampled quantities , and the associated scaling behavior .",
    "numerical results are presented in secs .",
    "iii and iv . a brief discussion is given in sec . v.",
    "we shall describe in details the bdp model on the square lattice .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .    as usual in the study of dp or ip",
    ", we view the bdp model as a stochastic growth process , and use the leath - alexandrowicz method  @xcite to grow the percolation cluster starting from a seed site . given the square lattice and the seed `` o '' in fig .",
    "[ conf](b ) , for each of the neighboring edges of site o , a random number is drawn to determine the edge state .",
    "if and only if the edge is occupied and the direction originates from the seed o , the neighboring site is activated and belongs to the growing cluster .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ conf](b ) , the four neighboring edges of site o are all occupied , but site c remains inactivated because of the `` wrong '' direction .",
    "after all the four neighboring edges have been visited , one continues the growing procedure from the newly added sites . in other words ,",
    "one grows the percolation cluster shell by shell ( the breadth - first scheme ) .",
    "the growth of the cluster continues until the procedure dies out or the maximum distance is reached , which is set at the beginning of the simulation .      in the cluster - growing process",
    ", the number of activated sites @xmath41 is recorded as a function of the shell number @xmath42 .",
    "let us count the shell of site `` o '' to be the first shell , the configuration in fig .",
    "[ conf](b ) has @xmath43 for @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "besides @xmath41 , one also records the euclidean distance @xmath45 of each activated site to the seed `` o '' for ip and to the @xmath46 axis for the anisotropic case .",
    "the reason for using different definitions of @xmath45 is that , for the anisotropic case , the average center of activated sites is expected to move linearly along the preferred direction , as @xmath42 increases .",
    "accordingly , we define a revised gyration radius @xmath47 as @xmath48 the statistical averages @xmath49 and @xmath50 are then measured , as well as their statistical uncertainties .",
    "we also measure the survival probability @xmath51 that at least one site remains activated at the @xmath42th shell and the accumulated activated site number @xmath52 .    in monte carlo study of critical phenomena and phase transitions , it is found that dimensionless ratios like the binder cumulant are very useful in locating the critical point .",
    "therefore , we also define a dimensionless ratio @xmath53 .",
    "near the percolation threshold @xmath12 , one expects the following scaling behavior @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents a small deviation from @xmath12 .",
    "symbols @xmath56 , and @xmath57 denote the associated critical exponents , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are universal functions . for simplicity , only one scaling field , which accounts for the effect due to deviation from @xmath12 ,",
    "is explicitly included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "right at @xmath12 , as @xmath42 increases , the survival probability @xmath51 decays to zero while the other quantities diverge , except for the ratio @xmath61 which goes to a constant .",
    "a trivial relation is @xmath62 .    for standard dp ( @xmath39 or 1 ) ,",
    "exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 are normally denoted as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ( @xmath64 is also denoted as @xmath67 in @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown that exponent @xmath57 is @xmath68 .",
    "further , exponent @xmath69 relates to @xmath65 and the dynamic exponent @xmath25 as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 arises from the behavior @xmath72 . below the upper critical dimensionality @xmath22 with @xmath23",
    ", there exist three independent exponents , which can be chosen as @xmath73 , @xmath21 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the others can be obtained by the scaling relations @xcite @xmath74 where the last one involves the spatial dimensionality @xmath75 and is called the hyperscaling relation . in @xmath26 dimensions",
    ", these exponents have been determined to high precision : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 @xcite . in @xmath79 dimensions , these exponents are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 @xcite .    for standard ip ( @xmath4 ) , the shell number @xmath42",
    "is frequently called `` chemical distance '' @xcite , accounting for the minimum length among all the possible paths between the seed site and the activated sites on the @xmath42th shell . at @xmath12 , the length @xmath42 of the chemical path relates to the euclidean distance",
    "@xmath45 as @xmath83 @xcite , with @xmath84 denoting the shortest - path exponent .",
    "in terms of the euclidean distance @xmath45 , it is known that the survival probability scales as @xmath85 , the accumulated site number @xmath86 , and the @xmath12-deviating scaling behavior @xmath87 .",
    "this immediately yields @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . for ip ,",
    "one has the scaling relation as @xmath90 in 2d , @xmath29 and @xmath21 are exactly known as @xmath30 and @xmath91 , which yield @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the shortest - path exponent @xmath94 , together with the so - called backbone exponent , is among the few critical exponents of which the exact values are not known for the 2d percolation universality class .",
    "it was conjectured to be @xmath95  @xcite , and some recent estimates are 1.1306(3 ) @xcite and 1.13078(5 ) @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "no exact results are available , and the numerical estimates are @xmath96  @xcite , @xmath97 and @xmath98  @xcite , which yield @xmath99 .",
    "in this work , we consider the bdp model on the square lattice for 2d and the simple - cubic lattice for 3d .",
    "the simulation applies the aforementioned leath - alexandrowicz growth method .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath61 is used to locate the percolation threshold @xmath12 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , ratio @xmath61 is expected to have an approximate common intersection at @xmath12 for different shell number @xmath42 . at the threshold @xmath12 , as @xmath100",
    ", the common intersection converges to a universal value @xmath101 and the slope of @xmath61 increases as @xmath102 .",
    "standard ip corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "monte carlo simulation was carried out up to @xmath103 for 2d and @xmath104 for 3d .",
    "about @xmath105 samples were taken for each data point on each lattice .",
    "the @xmath61 data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ip ] .",
    "indeed , we find an approximate common intersection near @xmath106 and @xmath107 for 2d and 3d , respectively .",
    "this agrees with the known threshold @xmath108 and @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "note that , since the occupied bond can propagate the growth process only if it has the correct orientation , there is a factor of 2 difference between the bond - occupation probability @xmath10 here and the @xmath10 of the equivalent bond percolation probability .     for ip in 2d ( top ) and 3d ( bottom ) . ]    to have a better estimate of @xmath12 , according to a least - squared criterion , the @xmath61 data are fitted by @xmath110 which is obtained by taylor - expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) and taking into account finite - size corrections due to the leading irrelevant scaling field and analytical background contribution .",
    "these are described by the two terms with amplitudes @xmath111 and @xmath112 , of which the term with @xmath113 arises from the nonlinearity of the relevant scaling field in terms of the deviation @xmath114 , and the one with @xmath115 accounts for the combined effect of the leading relevant and irrelevant scaling fields . in the fits ,",
    "various formulas are tried , which correspond to different combinations of those terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitq ] ) . for a given formula ,",
    "the @xmath61 data for small @xmath116 are gradually excluded from the fits to see how the residual @xmath117 changes with respect to @xmath118 .",
    "the results from different formulas are compared with each other to estimate the possible systematic errors . in two dimensions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "note that the leading irrelevant thermal scaling field is @xmath123 for 2d percolation universality @xcite ; apparently , the leading correction exponent @xmath124 does not correspond to @xmath125 .",
    "instead , @xmath126 should be associated with the chemical distance . from the relations @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , and the exact values @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we determine @xmath132 from @xmath120 , and @xmath133 from @xmath121 .    in three dimensions ,",
    "our results are @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the determination of the critical exponents @xmath65 and @xmath25 is obtained in an analogous way by simulating at the estimated percolation threshold , and the results are listed in table  [ tab : dp ] .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : dp ] strongly suggest that , as long as @xmath3 deviates from @xmath140 , the system falls into the standard dp universality class . for an illustration",
    ", we make the log - log plot of the critical quantity @xmath141 versus the shell number @xmath42 in fig .",

    "the bottom ( top ) panel is for 2d ( 3d ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the slope is identical for all the @xmath40 cases , and is distinct from that of ip ( @xmath4 ) . ]",
    "the fact that bdp for @xmath40 is in the dp universality means that in the language of renormalization group theory , the operator associated with the asymmetric perturbation is relevant near the ip fixed point . to confirm this , we simulate bdp near ip with @xmath142 by varying @xmath143 .",

    "according to scaling theory , the phase transition line @xmath161 approaches to the critical ip @xmath162 as @xcite @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the so - called crossover exponent .",

    "[ fig : fix_p ] , we plot @xmath157 versus @xmath158 in log - log scale , which indeed has slope approximately equal to @xmath166 .",
    "we also perform a similar study near the critical ip in 3d , and obtain @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we introduce a biased directed percolation model , which includes standard isotropic and directed percolation as two special cases .",
    "large - scale monte carlo simulations are carried out in two and three dimensions .",
    "we find that the operator associated with the anisotropy is relevant near the ip fixed point , which implies that bdp in the region @xmath169 is in the dp university class . on this basis ,",
    "the phase diagram and the associated renormalization flows are shown in fig .  [ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "line corresponds to isotropic percolation .",
    "the diagram for @xmath170 is drawn by symmetry .",
    "the arrows represent the direction of the renormalization flows . ]",
    "since the upper critical dimensionality is different for standard ip and dp , it is not clear whether the similar renormalization flows would hold in higher dimensions .",
    "we mention that such crossover phenomena have attract much attention both in the fields of equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in retrospect , it is not surprising that the asymmetric perturbation is relevant near ip . at ip ,",
    "all the directions are equivalent and `` spatial '' and `` temporal '' directions can not be defined .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath9 , such a symmetry is broken and the center of the activated sites moves along the `` temporal '' direction as the growing process continues .",
    "it is also plausible that as long as the `` spatial '' and `` temporal '' symmetry is not restored , such an asymmetric perturbation is irrelevant near dp .",
    "this is similar to the fact that asymmetric diffusion on the basic contact process is irrelevant  @xcite . in terms of the chemical distance @xmath42 ,",
    "the effect from the anisotropy can be asymptotically described as @xmath171 with @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "one can also use the euclidean distance @xmath45 to describe such an anisotropic effect as @xmath174 with @xmath175 . substituting the @xmath94 value into @xmath176 , one obtains @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "when viewing standard isotropic percolation in the framework of bdp , one observes that two independent critical exponents , e.g. , @xmath29 and @xmath21 , are no longer sufficient to describe the critical scaling behavior . in this case , the shortest - path exponent @xmath94 appears naturally and becomes indispensable , and thus isotropic percolation also has three independent critical exponents .",
    "our estimate of @xmath94 significantly improves over the existing results both in two and three dimensions .",
    "our result @xmath179 does not agree with the recently conjectured value @xmath180 @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "this result appears to refute the conjectured value .",
    "on the other hand , we note that , in terms of the chemical distance @xmath42 , a new source of finite - size corrections occurs in the scaling behavior , and these corrections are not well understood yet .",
    "further , we observe that the restored symmetry for ip can be regarded as @xmath181 in the bdp model . in some cases",
    ", the coincidence of two critical exponents may suggest the existence of logarithmic corrections of the @xmath182 or @xmath183 form , and they can be either additive or multiplicative . in practice , logarithmic finite - size corrections",
    "have indeed been observed for standard isotropic percolation in two dimensions  @xcite , which is in terms of euclidean distance . in this sense",
    ", we can not entirely exclude the possibility that the tiny difference between the present numerical result for @xmath184 and the conjectured value arises from some unknown corrections that have not been taken into account in the numerical analysis .",
    "numerical investigation of this problem seems very difficult if not impossible . nevertheless ,",
    "since the exact value of @xmath94 is conjectured as a function of @xmath185 for the @xmath185-state potts model  @xcite , one can accumulate more numerical evidence by studying the @xmath186 case .",
    "finally , the numerical estimate of the critical exponent @xmath153 or @xmath187 due to the asymmetric perturbation near ip raises a question : is it a `` new '' independent critical exponent or simply related in some way to the known ones like @xmath21 , @xmath29 , and @xmath94 ?",
    "in particular , in two dimensions , one would ask whether @xmath187 or @xmath153 can be exactly obtained in the framework of stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) , conformal field theory or coulomb gas theory .",

    "<S> extensive monte carlo simulations are carried out on the square and the simple - cubic lattices , and the numerical data are analyzed by finite - size scaling . </S>",

    "<S> these exponents are found to be consistent with those for standard dp . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the renormalization exponent associated with the asymmetric perturbation due to @xmath9 near ip , and confirm that such an asymmetric scaling field is relevant at ip . </S>"
