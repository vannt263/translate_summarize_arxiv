    "electrical capacitance tomography ( ect ) is an attractive method for imaging multiphase flows , as it is noninvasive , fast , safe and low cost @xcite .",
    "a typical ect system consists of three main parts : a multi - electrode sensor , an acquisition hardware and a computer for hardware control and image processing .",
    "specifically , the multi - electrode hardware in ect typically has @xmath1 electrodes surrounding the wall of the process vessel . the number of independent capacitance measurements in such a configuration is @xmath2 due to the independent number of sensor pairs with @xmath1 electrodes .",
    "the final objective is to recover the cross section or even 3d images of the permittivity distribution by using these measurements to solve an inverse problem .",
    "however , the inverse problem is underdetermined , since the number of measurements is far fewer than the number of pixels in the reconstructed image @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the governing equations to be considered are non - linear @xcite .",
    "various reconstruction algorithms have been developed to cope with these difficulties .",
    "direct , or single step , algorithms include the classic linear back projection ( lbp ) , approaches based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) , and tikhonov regularization @xcite . indirect , or iterative ,",
    "algorithms include landweber iterations ( li ) @xcite and iterative tikhonov methods @xcite .",
    "these algorithms all inherently assume a smooth permittivity distribution within the sample , but for many systems this assumption is poor . in recent years , concepts from compressive",
    "sensing ( cs ) theory@xcite have been shown to permit the reconstruction of sharp changes in permittivity @xcite .",
    "cs can not be applied strictly to ect image reconstruction due to the non - linear nature and because the sensitivity matrix does not satisfy the restricted isometry property ( rip ) . however , several researchers have extended the ideas of cs to non - linear systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we adapt ideas from cs to propose a comprehensive reweighted total variation iterative shrinkage thresholding ( tv - ist ) algorithm for non - linear ect image reconstruction . after explaining the ect physical model , we modify the conventional tv - ist to develop the tv - ist for ect and its fast version with auxiliaries .",
    "we introduce adaptive weights @xcite to approximate the @xmath3-norm solution closely .",
    "finally , we combine this reweighting approach with a method to minimize the non - linearity of the reconstruction by updating the sensitivity matrices within tv - ist . the algorithm has been examined using simulated measurements of phantoms to show its superiority compared with other existing algorithms .",
    "in ect , the permittivity distribution inside a pipe or vessel of interest , corresponding to the material distribution , is calculated from measured capacitances between all pairs of sensors located around the pipe s periphery .",
    "the total electric flux over all the electrodes surfaces is equal to zero , hence the potential and permittivity are obtained from a form of poisson s equation : @xmath4 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the spatial permittivity distribution , and @xmath6 the electric potential distribution .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath7 for the excited electrode and @xmath8 for other electrodes .    for the two - dimensional case @xmath9",
    ", the relationship between the capacitance and permittivity distribution can be expressed by the following equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total charge , @xmath12 denotes the closed line of the electrical field , @xmath13 is the permittivity distribution in the sensing field , and @xmath14 is the potential difference between two electrodes forming the capacitance .    in ( [ eq : c ] )",
    "@xmath15 is also a function of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore the capacitance between electrode combinations can be considered as a function of permittivity distribution @xmath13 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a non - linear function , and elements of @xmath19 are the non - redundant capacitance values obtained from the electrode pairs @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "if we descretise the permittivity and express it as a vector , we can estimate the changes in the capacitance values from a taylor s series expansion : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sensitivity of the capacitance with respect to changes in the permittivity distribution , and @xmath23 represents the higher order terms of @xmath24 . because @xmath25 is usually small ,",
    "the high order terms are often neglected .",
    "( [ eq : trianglec ] ) can be linearized in a matrix form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a jacobian / sensitivity matrix denoting the sensitivity distribution for each electrode pair , and @xmath29 . as a result",
    ", the non - linear forward problem has been reformulated to a linear approximation . generally in ect ,",
    "( [ eq : linearc ] ) is written in a normalized form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalized capacitance vector , @xmath32 is the jacobian matrix of the normalized capacitance with respect to the normalized permittivities , which gives a sensitivity map for each electrode pair , and @xmath33 is the normalized permittivity vector , which can be visualized by the colour density of the image pixels .",
    "the conventional optimization problem of ect becomes @xmath34 because there are @xmath1 electrode pairs , @xmath35 should be @xmath36 .",
    "the objective of the reconstruction algorithm of ect is to recover @xmath13 from measured capacitance vector @xmath19 . while in the discrete linear model",
    ", it is to estimate @xmath37 given @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is seen as a constant matrix determined in advance for simplicity .",
    "there are several difficulties with the reconstruction problem .",
    "firstly , ( [ eq : lambda ] ) is under - determined so the solution is not unique , and it is very sensitive to disturbances of @xmath40 .",
    "secondly , owing to the non - linearity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) , @xmath39 is not constant but varies for different permittivity distributions .    in this paper , we propose a non - linear reweighted total variation image reconstruction algorithm to overcome these difficulties .",
    "to recover the permittivity distribution image @xmath41 , many reconstruction algorithms for ect have been developed .",
    "generally the reconstruction algorithms can be categorized in two groups : direct algorithms and iterative algorithms . among them , landwater iteration and steepest descent method ( lwsdm ) is considered as one of the best algorithms with good efficiency .",
    "it minimizes the cost function @xmath42 , e.g. to minimize @xmath43 the gradient of @xmath44 is @xmath45 we iteratively update the image @xmath37 in the direction that @xmath44 decreases most quickly .",
    "therefore the new image will be @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a positive value determining the step size .",
    "in fact , lwsdm can be derived from the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm ( ista ) as a special case with ect constraints .",
    "here we introduce and explain the general model of ista on which our algorithm also is based .",
    "the ista is to solve a class of optimization problems with convex differentiable cost functions and convex regularization .",
    "[ ther : ista ] @xcite consider the general formulation : @xmath48 and the following assumptions are satisfied :    * @xmath49 : a smooth convex function which is also continuously differentiable with lipschitz continuous gradient @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the lipschitz constant of @xmath53 . * @xmath54 : a continuous convex function mapping @xmath55 * problem @xmath56 is solvable",
    ".    then basic ista converges to its true solution by running iteration @xmath57 , where its iteration : @xmath58    for example , lwsdm is actually a special instance of problem @xmath59 by substituting @xmath60 and @xmath61 as a smooth quadratic minimization problem with the lipschitz constant of the gradient @xmath53 being @xmath62 . then according to ( [ eq : p_l ]",
    ") we have @xmath63 which is equivalent to the lwsdm , where @xmath64 .",
    "theorem [ ther : ista ] provides the theoretical convergence for algorithms .",
    "total variation ( tv ) norm of the image has been used widely to penalize the cost function @xcite .",
    "it also has been verified that the tv norm can be utilized to address the under - determined image reconstruction and reproduce ect @xcite or other tomography images @xcite with sharp transitions in intensity .",
    "therefore , unlike conventional techniques for iterative reconstruction , we assume that there are sharp changes in intensity that can be sparsely represented by their spatial gradients . in this case",
    "the cost function is to minimize the least squares error and the sparsity of intensity changes : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the discrete isotropic tv of the two dimensional @xmath67 defined by @xcite : @xmath68 with the boundary conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "( [ eq : tv1 ] ) belongs to linear inverse problems with nonquadratic regularizers .",
    "nonquadratic regularizers include wavelet representations @xcite , sparse regression @xcite and total variation , etc .",
    "these problems can be solved by a signal processing technique called compressive sensing ( cs ) in the literature @xcite .",
    "ista is very convenient to solve cs problems with @xmath0 norm regularization .",
    "the non - linear shrinkage operation , or so called soft thresholding , is @xmath71 for instance , the ista and its derivative versions along with the shrinkage operation have been verified to solve wavelet - based reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) efficiently @xcite . in the next section we will explain how to implement ista to ect image reconstruction using tv regularization and prove its effectiveness .",
    "in this section we will present an iterative reconstruction technique for ect . as in ist",
    ", the iterative soft thresholding is applied to penalize the total variation of the ect image .",
    "some of the contents have been introduced in our conference paper @xcite . here",
    "we provide the full theoretical analysis of this algorithm and its convergence rate .    in the ect model , the permittivity distribution inside the pipe",
    "can usually be formulated as the 2d image / matrix @xmath72 .",
    "set @xmath37 is @xmath72 expressed as a column vector .",
    "@xmath73 denotes the pixel of the position @xmath74 in the imaging region .",
    "its magnitude is proportional to the permittivity difference @xmath25 and is @xmath75 outside of the imaging region .",
    "we use @xmath76 to represent the gradients of the image respectively which correspond to the horizontal and vertical finite differences . in detail",
    ", the gradient transforms are used to calculate the gradients : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are transform matrices .",
    "each element of @xmath79 corresponds to the same @xmath80th element in @xmath37 .",
    "likewise , given @xmath81 , an inverse transform can be carried out by solving a least squares ( ls ) problem of @xmath82 using linear algebra we can obtain the standard ls solution : @xmath83 @xmath84 approximates the laplacian operator for the image .",
    "it is an approximation of the fourier transform version @xcite but only considers the pixels within the imaging region .",
    "( a )        ( b )    to consider an isotropic form of tv , a single vector @xmath85 is used to represent the gradient magnitude , where elements of @xmath85 are given by @xmath86 .",
    "then ( [ eq : tv1 ] ) can be reformulated to @xmath87 equation ( [ eq : tvist1 ] ) is different from the conventional @xmath0 minimization problem .",
    "however , we can still use the iterative update idea to pursue the solution . instead of updating @xmath88 in iterations , here",
    "we calculate @xmath89 and @xmath90 by updating it to their steepest descent . following the second step in ( [ eq : x_k+1_f1 ] ) ,",
    "the residuals are calculated and projected to the @xmath89 and @xmath90 directions , respectively @xmath91 where @xmath92 due to the symmetry of matrix @xmath84 . as a result , according to the ist algorithm the gradients @xmath81 can be updated : @xmath93 where @xmath94 due to the requirements of lipschitz continuous , and @xmath95 are the iterative gradient solution that can be derived from @xmath96 if we only consider the least squares error .",
    "the next step is to optimize the @xmath85 with @xmath97 where @xmath98 is equal to @xmath99 multiplied by some constant .",
    "similar to ( [ eq : shrinkage ] ) , a shrinkage operator can be used .",
    "while here the difference to the conventional shrinkage is that rather than set a soft thresholding on @xmath100 directly , we decrease the magnitudes of @xmath100 by making it proportional to the magnitudes of @xmath101 after a soft thresholding on @xmath101 to reduce the total variation .",
    "the magnitude vector @xmath101 can be calculated element - wise by @xmath102 so for the ect tv - ist , the soft thresholding process can be carried out @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the shrinkage operator defined in ( [ eq : shrinkage ] ) , and this equation is calculated element - wise . by using this new soft thresholding process we are able to eliminate small variation and meanwhile reduce the large variation in @xmath100 directions .",
    "finally , the new reconstructed image can be updated by ( [ eq : ls ] ) , and the new gradients of the image are updated by multiplying the transform matrices @xmath105 which returns to the beginning of the section and completes one iteration in the algorithm .",
    "algorithm 1 sums up the total variation - iterative soft thresholding algorithm .",
    "+    -0.1 cm    [ cols=\"<\",options=\"header \" , ]      similar to the weighted @xmath0 minimization , it is natural to incorporate the reweighting technique in the total variation constraints .",
    "then the tv optimization problem for ect is transformed to @xmath106 in the following steps , ( [ eq : g12 ] ) and ( [ eq : hat_g12 ] ) remain the same for reweighted tv - ist in each iteration .",
    "the difference occurs in the soft thresholding step .",
    "because we want to pursue the minimal @xmath0 norm of the weighted tv , the thresholding process needs to be changed adaptively : @xmath107 where this operation should be done element - wise .",
    "it is a weighted version of the 2d soft threshold update . by using the weighted @xmath108 for thresholding",
    ", the @xmath0 norm behaves more like the @xmath3 norm .",
    "all the non - zero entries of @xmath85 above the threshold will be calculated more equally in the weighted norm , similar to the definition of the @xmath3 norm which see all non - zero entries contribute equally . finally , the weights @xmath109 vary depending on @xmath85 .",
    "specifically , the weights can be updated element by element as the second step of algorithm 3 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a parameter that is set slightly smaller than the expected nonzero magnitudes of @xmath85 . the value for @xmath112",
    "can be determined from experience , but in general should be small . moreover , in practice since the reconstructed result @xmath37 and its gradient @xmath85 evolves gradually after each iteration , we insert the weights updating step into the tv - ist algorithm every @xmath113 iterations . hence the weights can be updated every @xmath113 iterations and we can use the parameter @xmath113 to make a tradeoff between calculation speed and weights update .",
    "meanwhile , the auxiliary vectors @xmath114 can also be adopted to accelerate the convergence and the reweighted tv - ist becomes reweighted tv - fist .",
    "the faster implementation is always used here and henceforth the reweighted tv - fist will be referred to as reweighted tv - ist for simplicity .      before demonstrating the reweighted tv - ist algorithm",
    ", we explain two techniques that can be used to compensate for the non - linearity in our algorithm . in the ect model ,",
    "the non - linear effects can be resolved in two aspects .",
    "the first one is the approximation of the linear model in ( [ eq : linearc ] ) .",
    "the second non - linear effect lies on the accuracy of the measurements of the sensitivity matrix @xmath39 .",
    "two techniques are introduced here to address the non - linear effect , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , only the first of these is implemented in the simulations as it is computationally simpler .        from ( [ eq : trianglec ] ) to ( [ eq",
    ": linearc ] ) the quadratic and higher order terms have been neglected to reduce the ect model to a linear model .",
    "however this approximation causes errors due to the higher order terms that have been neglected . to offset this bias ,",
    "a fitting curve has been proposed @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the measurement at electrode @xmath80 when electrode @xmath117 is under the voltage @xmath118 while other electrodes are grounded , @xmath119 .",
    "this setting is to make sure that @xmath120 when @xmath25 tends to infinity and the slope is @xmath121 at @xmath122 .",
    "this approach may reduce the non - linear error by around @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the non - linear sensitivity matrix @xmath124 can be defined as @xmath125 combining ( [ eq : m ] ) and ( [ eq : s ] ) we have @xmath126 which adjusts @xmath39 to a non - linear sensitivity matrix @xmath124 , where the permittivity of the area of interest is assumed to vary from @xmath16 to @xmath25 , whose values can be determined before the experiments .",
    "an adaptive sensitivity matrix model has also been proposed for use with landweber iterations @xcite .",
    "we introduce this feedback iteration to our reweighted tv - ist algorithm .",
    "the sensitivity map for an electrode pair can be calculated from the potential distribution @xmath127 where @xmath128 are the gradient values of the potential with electrode @xmath80 in the row and column vectors , respectively ; and the potential value of each pixel can be computed after iterations using the finite difference method ( fdm ) depending on the potential values of the surrounding four pixels : @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the location indexes .    in summary ,",
    "the reweighted tv - ist algorithm for non - linear ect uses the tv penalties in the cost function to pursue the optimal solution iteratively and meanwhile makes use of the superiority of updated reweighted norms and the auxiliary method s fast convergence .",
    "it is distinct from conventional fista for total variation minimization and designed to be suitable for ect reconstruction specifically .",
    "compared to the conventional linear tv - ist , our non - linear reweighted tv - ist has two differences .",
    "firstly the reweighted term @xmath109 has been adopted in the cost function to pursue a more sparse total variation in the optimization process .",
    "this should produce clearer edges between areas with different permittivities .",
    "secondly , two methods are introduced to reduce the non - linear effects .",
    "the methods add an extra step in the algorithm ( step 2 in algorithm 4 ) to update the sensitivity matrix during the calculation .",
    "the two methods of non - linearity correction introduced in this section have similar effects .",
    "one is derived from the second order terms of the taylor series expansion , while the other represents the non - linearity from a potential distribution perspective . in algorithm 4 , either ( [ eq : ss ] ) or ( [ eq : s_ij ] ) can be used to compensate the non - linearity in ( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "herein we only consider the correction obtained using ( [ eq : ss ] ) as this implementation is faster .",
    "to test the proposed algorithm , numerical simulations were performed on an ect model .",
    "the results of reweighted tv - fist algorithm are compared with the performances of several widely used algorithms in practice , which include lbp , art ( relaxed kacmarz iteration ) and sirt ( relaxed cimmino iteration ) .",
    "all reconstructions are carried out on a standard desktop pc with an amd phenom(tm ) @xmath131 ghz processor and @xmath132 gb ram .",
    "the simulations are run in matlab 2009b and @xmath133 iterations were run throughout for each of these algorithms .",
    "the ect system ( normally with @xmath134 or @xmath135 electrodes here ) was modeled using the comsol multiphysics software package , and the sensitivity matrix was generated from comsol for all reconstructions .",
    "as in @xcite , the normalised capacitance was used to help minimise the effect of non - linearity introduced by the wall of the sensor @xcite .",
    "firstly , we implement various algorithms on a phantom consisting of an arc - shaped part and a circular object in a @xmath136 pixel image , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in the ect system we use @xmath134 electrodes , which can provide @xmath137 independent capacitance measurements .",
    "the smaller round object has image intensity ( a.u . ) of @xmath138 and the larger object has an intensity of @xmath139 ; black and white in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] correspond to intensities of 0 and 1 , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( b ) one can see that the two objects can be recovered approximately by the lbp reconstruction , however the shape is significantly smoothed and broadened compared with the true image in ( a ) .",
    "the landweber , art and sirt methods show a similar recovered result in ( c - e ) .",
    "errors in the permittivity distribution make precise identification of the boundary of the objects challenging .",
    "fig [ fig:1 ] ( f ) shows the reconstruction using reweighted tv - ist .",
    "the boundaries of both objects are clearly resolved with the correct intensity .",
    "the only significant error occurs at the wall of the system .",
    "the error at the wall is likely caused by non - linearity at the wall , or the use of the isotropic form of tv which can introduce smoothing at sharp points in the image .    in the second simulation ,",
    "the ect system consists of @xmath135 electrodes , which can provide @xmath140 independent capacitance measurements .",
    "the tested permittivity distribution was the ` two bubbles ' image , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](a )",
    ". it is a phantom image consisting of a circular pipe containing two circular objects in a @xmath136 pixel image . in the simulation , the relative permittivity of the cylindrical wall and the background was set to @xmath141 ; the relative permittivity of the two circular objects were @xmath139 and @xmath142 for the large and small objects , respectively .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](a ) is different from the normal ect permittivity distributions considered since the background has a high permittivity while the two bubbles have low permittivity .",
    "the lbp reconstruction of this image , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](b ) , fails as both bubbles blur into a single object .",
    "the poor reconstruction arises from the close proximity of the two bubbles and the use of a high permittivity background .",
    "landweber iterations , fig .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](c ) , gives a better result with the two bubbles resolved , but the bubbles still appear heavily smoothed .",
    "similar results were obtained for the art and sirt reconstructions . the linear tv - ist algorithm ,",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](d ) , recovers the sharp boundaries around the two bubbles .",
    "however , a high permittivity `` bridge '' is seen connecting the two bubbles and the permittivity of the smaller bubble is over estimated .",
    "the proposed reweighted tv - ist result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](g ) .",
    "the outline of the two bubbles is recovered fairly accurately , with only a slight tendency of the two bubbles to merge together and the size of the two bubbles overestimated by @xmath143% .",
    "the `` bridge '' seen using the standard tv - ist algorithm has been eliminated .",
    "the permittivity is also recovered fairly well with the permittivity of the large bubble found to be @xmath139 and the permittivity of the small bubble @xmath144 , which compare with the input permittivities of @xmath139 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "the non - linear reweighted reconstruction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wwobubble](h ) .",
    "the recovered bubble shapes are slightly more `` square '' than the input bubble shapes , but otherwise the outline of both bubbles is recovered well . the size of each bubble is accurate to within @xmath145% of the true bubble size .",
    "the permittivity in the large and small bubbles was @xmath139 and @xmath146 , respectively , in good agreement with the true values .",
    "the reconstruction quality is sensitive to the choice of the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath98 , and @xmath112 , as well as the number of iterations performed . however , overall",
    "these results demonstrate that the introduction of the reweighted tv - ist algorithm , including non - linearity correction , significantly improves the quality of the reconstructed images for piecewise smooth input permittivity distributions .",
    "the re - weighting approach enables the solution to approach the true @xmath3-norm solution closely , while the updates to the sensitivity matrix during image reconstruction help mitigate against the non - linearity effects .",
    "in this paper , a non - linear reweighted total variation algorithm for reconstruction of images obtained from ect measurements has been proposed and analyzed .",
    "the proposed algorithm penalises the @xmath0-norm of the spatial finite differences of the image ( total variation ) by using an iterative thresholding approach . a varying weight calculated in each iteration",
    "is used to make sure that the result converges towards the desired @xmath3-norm .",
    "in addition , the non - linearity of the governing equations was considered and a straightforward approach to update the sensitivity matrix was introduced accordingly .",
    "the proposed algorithm was verified on two simulated permittivity distributions .",
    "it is shown that the reweighting significantly increases the quality of the reconstructed images recovering sharper boundaries with fewer artefacts than existing algorithms including lbp , art , sirt and our previous implementation of tv - ist .",
    "the incorporation of the updated sensitivity matrix to approximate the non - linearity of the ect sensor further increased the accuracy of the reconstructed images , most notably in recovering quantitative permittivity values in each domain .",
    "the new algorithm here promises to increase the quality of ect imaging .",
    "we anticipate even greater benefits if the algorithm can be combined with recently proposed enhanced sensing strategies  @xcite .",

    "<S> this algorithm encourages sharp changes in the ect image and overcomes the disadvantage of the @xmath0 minimization by equipping the total variation with an adaptive weighting depending on the reconstructed image . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the non - linear effect is also partially reduced due to the adoption of an updated sensitivity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the proposed algorithm recovers ect images more precisely than existing state - of - the - art algorithms and therefore is suitable for the imaging of multiphase systems in industrial or medical applications .    </S>",
