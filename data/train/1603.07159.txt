    "error correction is an essential ingredient in classical computation and communication and is currently used in many state of the art technologies .",
    "shor s discovery of an algorithm @xcite to break the rsa cryptosystem showed that a quantum computer is a promising system for tackling hard computational problems .",
    "however , it was not clear if even conceptually a quantum computer could be constructed .",
    "the reason for the large doubt , is that even a small error in every computational step would accumulate quite swiftly to a large error .",
    "it implies that the future quantum computer could solve only small and probably trivial problems .",
    "remarkably , the theory of quantum fault tolerance @xcite showed that this intuition is wrong .",
    "actually , what is needed for the calculation of a quantum computer to give the right result with a small probability of failure is that every gate operation will fail with a small probability below a certain threshold .",
    "put simply , a gate error below the threshold is effectively as good as no error at all . to date , many quantum error correction schemes have been suggested @xcite and implemented @xcite . the predicted ability of a fault tolerant quantum computer to reach any desired precision raises a question whether this remarkable precision could be used for precise measurements .",
    "quantum metrology @xcite ; i.e. , enhanced metrology using quantum mechanics , is a well developed field with applications to photonic interferometry @xcite , magnetometry @xcite and atomic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , the quantum advantage rapidly degrades as noise takes its toll @xcite .",
    "therefore , to maintain this advantage in a noisy environment , error correction needs to be applied .",
    "several theory papers have been devoted to this issue that deal with a variety of noise types @xcite and there has been one implementation with nv centers in diamond @xcite using a carbon nuclear spin as the redundant qubit and a related implementation @xcite using the nv nuclear spin as the redundant qubit .    in this work ,",
    "we implement a combination of error correction and sensing for the first time using a photonic platform .",
    "the protocol we implement uses only linear optical elements .",
    "the error correction relies on the use of a protected entangled photon qubit and a gate which is realized by post - selection .",
    "not only the phase information , which we are interested in , is preserved , but the entire quantum state as well . due to the use of post - selection ,",
    "each error correction cycle is only @xmath1 viable ; however , this setup provides a proof of principle experiment that could have been achieved with deterministic gates which are currently being developed @xcite .",
    "let us consider a quantum state evolving under a hamiltonian which depends on an unknown parameter , which we want to measure .",
    "the state changes continuously as a function of the parameter as it propagates through a noisy path vulnerable to a single type of error , either a bit - flip or a phase - flip @xcite .",
    "if the data are integrated without an error correction , sensitivity drops as a result of cancellation between measurements with and without the error .",
    "however , if an error correction protocol is applied much faster than the time at which the deleterious effects of the noise become significant , the sensitivity level can be maintained .",
    "this scenario can be simulated by repeating a series of parameter probing and noise operations many times .",
    "instead of measuring once over a time @xmath2 , as in the usual sensing scheme , a measurement of duration @xmath3 is repeated @xmath4 times , where between each measurement the error is corrected .",
    "we present and implement the protocol by the optical realization of qubits using the polarization degree of freedom of photons , and denote the vertical ( horizontal ) linear polarization as @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "the birefringence phase , denoted as @xmath7 , is the unknown parameter .",
    "the scheme is composed of a regular interferometric setup for measuring a birefringent phase @xcite .",
    "however , in the presented model , the measurement of the birefringent phase is also associated with a noisy environment that flips the qubit . although we chose to correct bit - flips , phase - flip errors could have been corrected instead with a minor addition of polarization rotators .",
    "the full error correction scheme is presented in fig .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] .",
    "first , the bell state @xmath8 is generated , where the first qubit , denoted by @xmath9 , is protected and the second , denoted by @xmath10 and used for the phase measurement , is not .",
    "after the phase measurement the state is @xmath11 if the noise is applied , the state becomes a mixture of the original state and @xmath12 to correct the error , a phase of @xmath13 is added to the two qubits and a hadamard transform is operated solely on the second .",
    "then , the two photons are directed to the two inputs of a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . only the events in which the two output paths of the pbs are both occupied by a photon",
    "are post - selected , thus guaranteeing that both post - selected photons are either horizontally or vertically polarized . after the error correction operation ,",
    "both the perturbed and unperturbed states return to @xmath14 here the entanglement is between the two spatial paths , @xmath15 , the un - delayed spatial path and , @xmath16 , the delayed spatial path .",

    "one photon measures a birefringence phase ( @xmath7 in the figure ) , generated by two @xmath18 tilted calcite crystals with perpendicular optical axes @xcite .",
    "the bit - flip is generated by a @xmath23 half waveplate ( hwp ) for the horizontal polarization ( sad smiley in the figure ) .",
    "the error correction is composed of two quarter waveplates ( qwps ) placed in the two paths and a @xmath24 hwp in the noisy path .",
    "a pbs completes the error correction protocol .",
    "the multiple phase accumulation part is implemented by a @xmath25 long delay line , projecting photons from different pulses @xcite .",
    "two @xmath24 hwps are placed before the projecting pbs to avoid the collapse of the state by the measurement of the first photon .",
    "the block of the projecting pbs and the hwps was not used , as the results in this work were taken without the multiple phase accumulation part .",
    "eventually , basis transformation is carried out with hwps and qwps and the photons are detected by single photon detectors .",
    "the data are accumulated by fpga electronics.,width=325 ]    error correction is realized by employing a non - unitary operation using a pbs and post - selection .",
    "this is analogous to applying an error correction without measurement @xcite and initialization .",
    "the difference here is that this is realized without extending the size of the code , but by applying a decoding operation .    in order to repeat the measurement , one photon",
    "is measured while its twin ( denoted as @xmath26 ) is delayed for time @xmath27 until another pair of entangled photons , @xmath28 , is generated , where the upper index denotes the time of creation .",
    "after the second pair accumulates the phase and is corrected , the delayed photon from the first pair interferes on a pbs with the un - delayed photon ( denoted as @xmath29 ) from the second pair , swapping the entanglement and resulting in the state @xmath30 compared to the shot - noise limit , the limit of classical measurements .",
    "more experimental details and a discussion on the entanglement swapping between delayed photons can be found in ref .",
    "we divide the demonstration into two parts : correction of bit - flip errors and the successive accumulation of consecutive measurement results . the second part has already been demonstrated by our group in a previous work @xcite",

    "errors were calculated assuming poisson error distributions .",
    "they are smaller than the symbol sizes , and thus they are not displayed.,width=325 ]    the phase information can be retrieved by interfering the @xmath32 amplitudes .",
    "one way to achieve this is to detect the photons in the circular polarization basis .",
    "a right ( left ) handed circularly polarized photon is defined as @xmath33 .",

    "a visibility as high as @xmath36 was observed in the case of the original ( unperturbed uncorrected ) state , which indicates a well prepared initial state , where the corrected states have slightly lower visibilities due to optical imperfections .",
    "the phases of the corrected states are similar to the original phase , but the phase of the perturbed uncorrected state is not .",
    "our demonstration provides an important example where using an entangled ( quantum ) state has an advantage over a separable ( classical ) state @xcite .",
    "the entanglement allows for the correction of the state and preservation of the measurement of the phase without an error . in fig .",
    "[ sensitivity ] , we used the experimental results presented in fig .",
    "[ visibility ] to estimate the sensitivity as a function of the noise rate .",
    "the count number is normalized , making the maximal sensitivity unity .",
    "the sensitivity after the error correction is greater than @xmath37 and nearly independent of the noise rate .",
    "the sensitivity without error correction is linearly impaired and almost vanish as the noise rate achieves @xmath38 . in the presented scenario , in principle , the correction could restore the fidelity completely as the sensing of the birefringent phase and the bit - flip noise are spatially disconnected and are induced in the right order , i.e. , the signal first and then the bit - flip .",
    "noteworthy is that in other scenarios in which both the noise and the signal overlap in time or in space , or occur in different order , a large rate of error correction is required to reach high sensitivity . nevertheless , when the signal measurement and noise stages are repeated multiple times , the significance of their order vanishes with the increasing number of stages .",

    "it works only if the projection is between two @xmath39 s , which means that the entire state must be corrected .",
    "thus , we also performed a complete quantum state tomography to the perturbed / unperturbed corrected / uncorrected states for all phases @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the fidelities between all states and the original state @xcite , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fidelity ] .",
    "the fidelities are close to one for all phases which indicates that we have recovered the original state . in contrast",
    ", the fidelity with the perturbed uncorrected state is close to zero , demonstrating the orthogonality between these states .",
    "in conclusion , we have realized a proposal to use a quantum error correction protocol to recover sensitivity in the presence of a single type error such as bit - flipping noise .",
    "a linear optics implementation of the measurement and the error correction is presented and demonstrated using a pbs and post - selection on the polarization degree of freedom of photons .",
    "the perturbed state was projected back onto the original state .",

    "first we would like to present the error correction protocol for a more general noise .",
    "the noise rotation that occurs with probability @xmath40 is @xmath41 and real .",
    "the entangled perturbed state is @xmath42 the experiment that was realized is a specific example for @xmath43 and the phase @xmath44 .",
    "we now prove that the transformation , @xmath45 on the noisy qubit and the applied post - selection correct the error , where @xmath46 is the phase of the non - zero complex number @xmath47 .",
    "this transformation can be generated in the lab by a phase shifter , a half - wave plate at angle @xmath48 and another phase shifter .",
    "it can be noticed that @xmath49 the second and third terms are simplified by taking a common factor of @xmath50 .",
    "then , we replace @xmath51 by @xmath52 but @xmath53 is the phase of this number .",
    "thus , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is cancelled out and we get : @xmath56 where in the third expression the definition for @xmath57 is used .    next , only the events where the two photons have the same polarization are post - selected via a pbs .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 and @xmath59 and we get @xmath60 the state is corrected up to a global phase @xmath57 with a probability of @xmath61 .      using deterministic gates the setup",
    "is composed of a gate that maps the noise to one qubit and the information to the other , followed by an initialization of the qubit that contains the noise @xcite .",
    "a more detailed explanation is needed where a pbs and post - selection is used , where one can think that the post - selection for the error correction and entanglement swapping are mixed .",
    "the reason it does work is due to post - selection both in space and time .",
    "the derivation is divided into three steps : first , we show that for a four photon event without noise the final state is @xmath62 where as in the text the upper index represents the time of creation and the lower index represents the spatial path .",
    "second , we will generalize it to a four photon event with or without noise .",
    "third , we will generalize this to a @xmath63 photon event .",
    "we assume that two pairs of photons were generated , and we neglect high order terms .",
    "we only look at sequences where one photon is detected at time zero , two photons are detected at time @xmath64 ( in different spatial paths ) and one photon is detected at time @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath27 is the travel time of a photon in the delay line .",
    "after the measurement and correction of the first pair ( i.e. after the pbs and before the post - selection ) the state is : @xmath66 the last two terms contribute to two photons at time @xmath67 or @xmath64 .",
    "if the two photons are measured in different detectors , the post - selection fails and data are disregarded .",
    "if the two photons are measured with the same detector as one photon , the sequence will be a three photon event or less , and thus will be discarded .",
    "therefore , the temporal post - selection only leaves the two first terms , where one photon will be detected at time @xmath67 and one at time @xmath64 .",
    "thus , in order to get the right sequence , another photon must be detected at time @xmath64 and its twin at time @xmath65 .",
    "this can only happen if the second pair is generated at a delay of @xmath27 with respect to the generation of the first pair and exactly one photon enters the delay line . if these conditions are fulfilled , the four photon state is @xmath68    the next step is entanglement swapping on a pbs .",
    "we first define @xmath69 ( up to a global phase ) .",
    "then , two half - wave plates rotate the basis from @xmath32 to @xmath70 , the @xmath71 diagonal linear polarization basis . after returning to the @xmath32 basis , eq .",
    "[ two_phi_after_ps ] becomes @xmath72 ) and the non - delayed photon of the second pair ( denoted by @xmath73 ) are in different paths after the pbs , which gives : @xmath74 using basic trigonometric identities we get the state , @xmath75 .",
    "another rotation by a half - wave plate results in the state of eq .",
    "[ final_stt ] , as was required .",
    "the generalization to a perturbed state is straightforward .",
    "the error correction post - selection is done by post - selecting the time of photon detections .",
    "this post - selection is independent from the noise .",
    "after this post - selection , the state is corrected back to @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the entanglement swapping is between two corrected states , and the result is the same .",
    "finally , a similar derivation applies to any number of photon pairs .",
    "an event of one photon in time zero , two photons in time @xmath77 and one photon in time @xmath78 can only be detected if all the error correction post - selections succeeded .",
    "then , the entanglement swapping is always between two states of @xmath76 ( with different @xmath7 s ) , which results in the state latexmath:[\\[\\label{last_one } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (            a.y .",
