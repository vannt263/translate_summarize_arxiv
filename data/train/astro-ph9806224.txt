    "since its launch in 1991 , the egret instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) has detected with high significance 51 agns as emitters of high energy @xmath4-rays ( mukherjee et al .",
    "these sources all appear to be members of the blazar class of agns ( von montigny et al .",
    "1995a ) , containing bl lac objects , highly polarized quasars ( hpq ) , and optically violent variable ( ovv ) quasars . in the radio",
    "these agns are radio - loud and flat - spectrum ( radio spectral index @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-ray emission from these sources has notable properties , including high @xmath4-ray flux that in many of the sources dominates the flux at lower energies , and rapid variability on timescales of a few days or less ( e.g. von montigny et al .",
    "the high @xmath4-ray flux and rapid time variability have been used to argue that the @xmath4-ray emission must be relativistically beamed ; if not , the @xmath4-ray emission would be attenuated by pair - production optical depth .",
    "significant doppler beaming factors for egret sources have been derived by this method by e.g. mattox et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and dondi & ghisellini ( 1995 ) .    in the relativistic beaming model ,",
    "the @xmath4-ray sources are strongly beamed and should display certain distinct properties when imaged with vlbi , including apparent superluminal motion of jet components , a high degree of core dominance , and jets which are strongly bent by projection effects .",
    "some of the egret sources had been well monitored with vlbi before their detection by egret , and they did indeed display these properties .",
    "proper motion measurements for 13 egret sources are listed by vermeulen & cohen ( 1994 ) , hereafter vc94 .",
    "the measured apparent velocities of these sources are all superluminal ( provided the redshift of 0716 + 714 is above 0.28 ) , with the exceptions of 0458 - 020 , 1127 - 145 , and cta 102 .",
    "vlbi observations of other sources have been spurred by their egret detections , and superluminal motion has recently been reported in 0420 - 014 ( wagner et al .",
    "1995 ) , 0528 + 134 ( krichbaum et al . 1995 ; pohl et al .",
    "1995 ) , 0954 + 658 and 1219 + 285 ( gabuzda et al .",
    "1994 ) , 1633 + 382 ( barthel et al . 1995 ) , and 1730 - 130 ( bower et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a campaign to monitor the southern egret sources with vlbi is underway , with first results reported by tingay et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the fact that many of the egret sources were relatively obscure until their detection by egret indicates that , despite the recent concentration on vlbi observations of egret sources , there remain many @xmath4-ray sources which have not been well studied with vlbi . to the best of our knowledge , before this study",
    "there were 21 egret sources with published vlbi proper motion measurements ( many of which were not of high reliability ( vc94 ) ) , leaving 30 egret sources which had not been studied with vlbi at multiple epochs .",
    "some of these sources had been imaged or had had a vlbi intensity measurement made , but proper motion studies had not been published .",
    "the study of which this paper is a part has attempted to examine as many egret sources as possible which had not been previously well observed with vlbi , using the geodetic vlbi database of the washington vlbi correlator located at the u.s .",
    "naval observatory ( usno ) .",
    "reports have already been published of the measurement of superluminal motion in the quasar 1611 + 343 ( piner & kingham 1997a , hereafter paper i ) and the measurement of a more standard superluminal velocity for the quasar 1156 + 295 ( piner & kingham 1997b , hereafter paper ii ) , which had previously had a much larger measured superluminal velocity than any other source ( mchardy et al .",
    "1993 , 1990 ) .",
    "detailed observations of three more sources are presented in this paper .    a study such as this has several potential benefits .",
    "it is important to understand why some of the sources sharing the common characteristics of egret blazars have not been detected in @xmath4-rays .",
    "one possible reason is that the @xmath4-ray emission may be more narrowly beamed than the radio emission ( von montigny et al .",
    "other possible reasons include intrinsic differences between the sources and long timescale variability of the @xmath4-ray emission .",
    "vlbi measurements of such things as apparent superluminal motion can provide information on important quantities such as the angle of the jet to the line - of - sight , and can help to address this question .",
    "high - resolution vlbi observations can also potentially discern any effects of @xmath4-ray flares on the jet structure .",
    "this study also demonstrates the usefulness of archival geodetic vlbi data for astrophysics .",
    "several authors have used geodetic vlbi data for astrophysical purposes .",
    "all imageable sources in a single geodetic experiment were imaged by charlot ( 1990 ) , and geodetic vlbi images have been presented in papers on the individual sources 0528 + 134 ( krichbaum et al .",

    "the study of which this paper is a part has a similar large - scale scope , with over one hundred images of six egret sources having been studied in detail ( piner 1998 ) .",
    "using archival geodetic vlbi data has several advantages .",
    "many sources are observed very frequently , allowing for excellent time sampling .",
    "the archive extends back to 1986 , allowing for an approximate ten - year time baseline for most sources .",
    "many of these sources were not observed by the astronomical vlbi community until after their announcement as egret sources in at least 1991 .",
    "we discuss the selection of the individual sources studied in this paper in @xmath6  [ sources ] , the archived geodetic vlbi observations in @xmath6  [ observations ] , the motions of the individual jet components in @xmath6  [ motion ] , and astrophysical implications of these results in @xmath6  [ discussion ] .",
    "we use @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3=0.5 , and the flux @xmath7 throughout the paper .",
    "for this study , we wished to find egret sources which had many good observations in the usno geodetic vlbi database and had not had vlbi proper motion measurements published .",
    "for the list of egret sources , we used the 43 strong detections of agns given in the second egret catalog ( thompson et al .",
    "1995 ) and the catalog supplement ( thompson et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we also included four sources  3c66a , cta 26 , 1622 - 297 , and 2155 - 304  for which new results gave significant enough detections that there was little doubt they would be included as strong detections in future lists ( hartman 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "these four sources are indeed included , along with four other new sources , in the recent list in mukherjee et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "observations of 700 galactic and extragalactic sources are included in the usno geodetic vlbi database from the beginning of the program in 1986 until 1996 november .",
    "of the 47 egret sources considered , 39 had at least one observation in the database .",
    "of these , 26 had at least one observation with the necessary @xmath8 plane coverage to make an image , and 20 of these had been observed often enough and well enough to produce a series of images .",
    "nine of these 20 sources already had reliable vlbi proper motion measurements published .",
    "the remaining 11 sources were 0202 + 149 , 0208 - 512 , 0235 + 164 , cta 26 , 0537 - 441 , 1156 + 295 , 1510 - 089 , 1606 + 106 , 1611 + 343 , 1622 - 253 , and 1739 + 522 .",

    "the background details of this archival data and the reduction techniques are described in paper i. as discussed in paper i , some images have been formed by combining data from several geodetic vlbi experiments close together in time .",
    "this can be done as long as there is negligible change in the observable source structure over the time span of the summed observations , which is true for all observations that were combined for this paper .",
    "when experiments were combined , the aips task dbcon was used to combine them as separate subarrays .",

    "the lower resolution 2 ghz images usually see the core plus the inner 8 ghz components as only a single component .",
    "since it is impossible to deconvolve these merged components and know how much flux is coming from each , we do not include these merged 2 ghz components in table  [ mfittab ] . in the model fits listed in table  [ mfittab ] we have fixed the location of the presumed core to be at the origin and give positions for all other components relative to the core .",
    "for all three of these sources we have selected as the core the brightest compact component at the end of the extended jet structure . in all of these sources",
    "this component also has the flattest spectral index .",
    "determining accurate errors in the model - fit parameters is problematic .",
    "formal methods for calculating the errors , such as that described by biretta , moore , & cohen ( 1986 ) , rely on varying a given parameter until the reduced @xmath16 increases by a certain factor .",
    "this gives an estimate for the uncertainty in a parameter within that particular observation , but it does not take into account the differences in @xmath8 plane coverage among observations in a series , which may cause differences in the model - fit parameters among observations which are much larger than the associated formal errors . since geodetic vlbi observations can have drastically different antennas and @xmath8 plane coverages , we might expect that this effect would dominate for a series of geodetic vlbi images .",
    "indeed , we have used the method of biretta , moore , & cohen ( 1986 ) to derive formal errors for the model - fit parameters of 1611 + 343 presented in paper i , and it is obvious from the large scatter in the points that the formal errors are much too small .",
    "the only way to derive an accurate estimate for the errors is to model fit a series of images made from observations with varying @xmath8 plane coverages over a small enough time interval that the source structure does not change and note the scatter in the model - fit parameters .",
    "many of the sources in the usno database have observations close enough together in time that this can be done .",
    "since we expect errors in the component positions to be proportional to the beam size , we express the errors as a fraction of the beam and note that for nearly simultaneous images of 1611 + 343 ( paper i ) , and 1606 + 106 , the scatter in the model - fit component positions is about a quarter of a beam fwhm .",
    "we have accordingly used a quarter of a beam as the error in the position for most of the components , except for those noted below . for the beam size in a given direction",
    "we have used the maximum projection of the beam onto a line in that direction .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that model fitting will more accurately locate bright , compact components . from condon ( 1997 )",
    "it can be derived that the positional error should be proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the surface brightness of the component .",
    "we have accordingly used smaller error bars for the brighter , more compact components .",
    "we have used 1/6 of a beam for component c2 in 0202 + 149 , and 1/16 of a beam for the very bright , very compact component c3 in cta 26 .",
    "the bright 2 ghz component c1 in 0202 + 149 is elongated perpendicular to the radial direction ; we have used 1/10 of a beam for the radial error and 1/6 of a beam for the angular error . in all cases",
    "the observed scatter of the positions about the fitted lines agrees with the chosen error bars . for the fitted fluxes",
    "the calibration error must be added to the model fitting error . since the calibration errors are relatively large for these geodetic vlbi experiments , the model - fit fluxes are in general not very accurate , except possibly for the very bright components .",
    "in this section we discuss the motions of the individual components in both radius and position angle .",
    "two of the sources , cta 26 and 1606 + 106 , have components moving outward at apparent superluminal velocities , while the components in 0202 + 149 are clearly subluminal .",
    "we have calculated values for the apparent velocities by performing least - squares fits to the component distances from the cores as a function of time , using the model - fit positions and errors discussed in the preceding section . in all cases a linear fit was adequate , i.e. we have no significant detection of acceleration or deceleration of any of the components .",
    "when a component was detected at more than one frequency , we fit the positions measured at each frequency separately to avoid effects from frequency - dependent separation .",
    "we then took the weighted average of the velocities measured at the different frequencies to obtain a single value for the velocity .",
    "for all three of the sources discussed here , the velocities measured for the individual components are consistent with all components within the source having the same velocity .",
    "motion of the jet components in position angle is also discussed in this section .",
    "all position angle values are measured from north through east . here",
    "we also present data on the motion of the components of 1156 + 295 in position angle , since only the outward motions of the 1156 + 295 components were discussed in paper ii .",
    "curved jets on vlbi scales are a common feature of blazars , and we observe bent jets in the sources we have studied . in fact , we have highly significant detections of different position angles for different components for all five of the sources we have studied in detail . whether or not individual components move in position angle , and whether or not they follow other components , must be examined on a case - by - case basis .",
    "this requires longer monitoring of individual components , and preferably waiting until a component reaches the same radial distance from the core previously occupied by an earlier component . for 1611 + 343 ( paper i ) , we found that components were located at different position angles , but that motion with constant position angle was adequate to fit individual component motions .",
    "we observed significantly different position angles for components at the same radial distance , which ruled out motion of the components along identical curved paths .",
    "the source 0202 + 149 is a flat - spectrum radio quasar with a redshift of 0.833 ( stickel et al .",

    "they found that the structure of 0202 + 149 was well fit by a model with two components separated by @xmath193.4 milliarcseconds ( mas ) along a position angle of @xmath20 .",
    "the separation of the components did not change significantly over the three epochs , although the low resolution of the observations does not allow the authors to place a very strict upper limit on the proper motion .",
    "they find that both components vary in flux , the southeastern component brightens , and the northwestern component fades over the three epochs .",

    "the separations from the core as a function of time that we measure from our images are shown in figures 7@xmath13 and @xmath22 for components c1 and c2 respectively . by taking the weighted average of the velocities found from separate fits to the 2 , 8 , and 15 ghz positions of c1",

    ". both of these velocities are consistent with no motion , and the one - sigma upper limits are 0.99 and 0.42 @xmath0 for c1 and c2 respectively . since the measured positions are consistent with stationary components , we have plotted the best fits to constant separation from the core in figures 7@xmath13 and @xmath22 . in figure 7@xmath13",
    "the fitted separations are at successively greater distances from the core as the frequency increases .",
    "this frequency - dependent separation was also seen in 1156 + 295 ( paper ii ) and has been noted by other authors ( e.g. biretta , moore , & cohen 1986 ) .",
    "it may be due to gradients in magnetic field and electron density , which cause the @xmath25 surface to move progressively inward at higher frequencies .",
    "the frequency - dependent separation in figure 7@xmath22 appears to go in the wrong direction , although the error bars on the 15 ghz points are such that this separation is not significant .",

    "the vlbi observations of 0202 + 149 at 1.7 ghz presented by bondi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show a bright component about 3.4 mas from the core which can probably be identified with our component c1 .",

    "( 1996 ) positions which cover the time range 1980 to 1987 , combined with our measured 2 ghz positions which cover the time range 1989 to 1996 , then a slightly superluminal velocity of 1.8@xmath230.5 @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "however , this velocity comes entirely from the difference in separation between the bondi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) points and our points , and each set of measurements individually is consistent with no motion .",

    "observations of @xmath4-rays from 0202 + 149 imply that the source is strongly beamed .",
    "this strong beaming , together with the very low apparent velocities , means that the jet must be aligned extremely close to the line - of - sight if the component velocities reflect the bulk motion of material in the jet .",
    "indications of strong beaming have been seen in the other compact f doubles in the form of high jet / counterjet brightness ratios .",
    "conway et al . (",
    "1994 ) show that the stationary components then imply such a small angle of the jet to the line - of - sight that the probability of observing these sources is very low .",
    "they suggest two models to explain the stationary components of compact f doubles , although the large - scale properties of these sources , which also make them quite different from normal core - jet sources , remain to be explained .",
    "the components could represent standing shocks in the jet , implying that the component velocities are much less than the bulk velocity of jet material .",
    "alternatively , the components could be due to relativistic flow close to the line - of - sight along a curving jet , and since a curving jet samples a range of angles to the line - of - sight , the arguments suggesting a low probability of detection would not apply . since both of these models allow for bulk relativistic motion close to the line - of - sight , the detection of @xmath4-rays from a compact f double seems compatible with either model .",
    "it is interesting to see if vlbi component ejections correlate with outbursts in the light curves of these sources .",

    "( 1994 , 1990 ) , zensus et al . (",
    "such a correlation is not surprising ; since newly emerged vlbi components typically have a high radio flux , it is not unexpected that they would contribute significantly to the total light curve",

    "then we would actually be observing the effects of enhanced activity in the central engine as they propagated down the jet . in the common shock interpretation of vlbi components ,",
    "@xmath4-ray and optical emission could originate in these compact energetic shocks as they form and move out from the core . after some time , typically zero to several hundred days ( tornikoski et al . 1994 ) , the component becomes optically thin to lower frequency radio emission , causing the observed brightening in the radio . also at about this time , depending on source distance and vlbi resolution , the component becomes resolved from the `` core '' in vlbi observations , where the vlbi `` core '' is simply the point at which the jet becomes optically thick .",
    "such a detailed scenario in which the @xmath4-ray emission is due to a propagating discontinuity ( corresponding to a jet component observed with vlbi ) in a poynting flux jet , and where the delay of the radio emission is due to self - absorption or free - free absorption by external plasma , has been proposed by romanova & lovelace ( 1996 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) ) , but for 1156 + 295 it appears there is definitely no component correlated with the 1993 egret flare . if there was a correlated component in this source , then it is likely that it was so short lived that it was not detected .",
    "these data give no indication that egret flares are correlated with vlbi component ejections , contrary to the correlations observed by other authors discussed earlier in this section .",

    "since the value of the apparent superluminal velocity is a function of both the lorentz factor @xmath50 and the angle to the line - of - sight @xmath51 , knowledge of the apparent speeds alone is sufficient only to place a lower limit on @xmath50 or an upper limit on @xmath51 .",

    "this assumes that the lorentz factor of the pattern speed seen in the superluminal motions , @xmath54 , is the same as the lorentz factor of the bulk fluid flow causing the doppler boosting , @xmath55 , which for some sources may be an incorrect assumption .",

    "one method , ( see e.g. marscher 1987 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 , hereafter gpcm ) , assumes that the x - ray flux from the source is produced by the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "the expected ssc emission from a vlbi component depends on @xmath53 and on parameters which can be estimated from the vlbi images . a lower limit to the doppler factor , @xmath56 ,",

    "another method of calculating @xmath53 ( e.g. , dondi & ghisellini 1995 , hereafter dg95 ) can be applied to @xmath4-ray sources by demanding that the optical depth due to pair - production be low enough for @xmath4-rays to escape .",
    "this optical depth depends on @xmath53 , so a lower limit , @xmath57 , can be obtained by setting the optical depth equal to 1 .",
    "readhead ( 1994 ) notes that intrinsic brightness temperatures of sources do not vary much from the `` equipartition brightness temperature ''  the brightness temperature at which there is equipartition of energy between the radiating particles and the magnetic field .",
    "the observed brightness temperature can be compared with the equipartition brightness temperature to determine the equipartition doppler factor , @xmath58 ( gijosa & daly 1996 , hereafter gd96 ) .",
    "each of these methods has drawbacks ; the first two give only lower limits to @xmath53 and the third assumes equipartition , which may not be valid in all sources .",
    "a lower limit on the doppler factor implies that when these doppler factors are compared with apparent superluminal velocities , only lower limits to @xmath50 and upper limits to @xmath51 can be obtained , although these limits are often better than those obtained using the apparent velocity alone .",
    "we have calculated @xmath56 for the core components of the sources in our sample .",
    "unfortunately , these doppler factors depend on powers as high as the square of sometimes poorly known quantities such as the angular size of the component and the frequency and flux at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum . since we only have observations at two frequencies , we are not able to precisely determine the peak of the synchrotron spectrum , and in general we assume a turnover at 8 ghz if the spectrum is rising over the observed range , a turnover at 2 ghz if it is falling , or a turnover at 5 ghz if it is flat .",
    "we have high resolution for each of our observing frequencies , which should give relatively accurate measurements of the core angular size .",
    "we also average the doppler factors calculated at the individual epochs to obtain the estimate of @xmath53 for each source .",
    "this averaging should alleviate some of the error introduced by inaccurate measurements of angular size or flux density . although gpcm , dg95 , or gd96 have calculated doppler factors for all of our sources except 0202 + 149 , they all used single - epoch single - frequency vlbi data , and hence were forced to assume that the frequency of observation was the turnover frequency .",

    "this equation is @xmath59^{1/(4 - 2\\alpha)}(1+z),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the flux density ( in jy ) at the turnover frequency @xmath62 ( in ghz ) , @xmath63 is the x - ray flux density ( in jy ) at frequency @xmath64 ( in kev ) , @xmath65 is the synchrotron high - frequency cutoff ( assumed to be @xmath66hz , ( gpcm ) ) , @xmath67 is the angular diameter of the radio core at the turnover frequency ( in mas ) , and the sign of @xmath68 has been changed to reflect the convention used in this paper .",
    "this equation assumes the radiating component is a homogeneous sphere .",
    "while more sophisticated geometries such as conical jets have been used by some authors , e.g. unwin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , they also require more sophisticated multi - frequency vlbi data in order to constrain them . in keeping with gpcm , we use an optically thin spectral index of @xmath69 and use x - ray fluxes from dg95 .",
    "gd96 report two correction factors that must be applied to this equation : a factor of 1.8 in the angular size and a factor of 2 in the flux at the spectral peak .",
    "when we calculated doppler factors for 1611 + 343 in paper i , we were aware of only the first of these correction factors , so we give fully corrected values for 1611 + 343 here .",
    "values of the doppler factors and the corresponding limits to @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given in table  [ doppler ] .",
    "note that since @xmath70 has a minimum of @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the apparent velocity , at @xmath73 , then if @xmath74 the lower limit obtained on @xmath50 is the same as that obtained from the apparent velocity alone .",

    "the values of @xmath56 found for 1606 + 106 and 1611 + 343 are considerably higher than the corresponding values found by dg95 , possibly due to higher resolution of our vlbi observations .",
    "the values of @xmath56 calculated for these five sources are considerably higher than the values of @xmath57 calculated for these same sources by dg95 .",
    "in fact , the average value of @xmath56 for the entire dg95 sample is higher than the average value of @xmath57 for the same sample , which implies that the @xmath4-ray optical depth in these sources is considerably less than 1 , since a value of unity is assumed in the calculation of @xmath57 .",
    "the angles to the line - of - sight listed in table  [ doppler ] are all relatively small , as is expected for strongly beamed sources . in particular , the high doppler factor and low apparent velocity of 0202 + 149 imply a very small angle to the line - of - sight of 0.15@xmath30 .",
    "the chance probability of a source having such a small angle to the line - of - sight is only 3.4@xmath75 .",
    "such an unreasonably small angle must imply that the pattern speed @xmath54 is much less than the bulk fluid speed @xmath55 ( this equality being assumed in the calculation of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , or that the stationary components represent points along a curving jet where the jet is directly aligned with the line - of - sight .",
    "one of these situations is what we would expect , given the nature of 0202 + 149 as a compact f double ( see @xmath6  [ compactf ] ) .",
    "a similar situation may exist for 1606 + 106 , since it also has a low @xmath72 but high @xmath53 .",
    "the other sources also have angles close to the line - of - sight , and in fact all except 1156 + 295 are on the small angle side of the maximum in the @xmath76 relation , where the apparent velocity _ decreases _ with decreasing angle to the line - of - sight . if we consider a hubble constant of 50 rather than 100 , thus doubling the values of @xmath72 , the angles to the line - of - sight become larger for all sources except 1156 + 295 , and the angular solutions for cta 26 and 1611 + 343 move to the large angle side of the maximum in the @xmath76 relation .",
    "one of the major questions to be answered about the egret sources is why some of the sources sharing the common characteristics of egret blazars are not detected in @xmath4-rays .",
    "some possible reasons for this mentioned by von montigny et al .",
    "( 1995b ) are that there may be intrinsic differences between the detected and undetected sources ; that all blazars emit @xmath4-rays but some are not currently seen due to long timescale variability ; and that the @xmath4-ray emission may be beamed more narrowly than the radio emission .",
    "vlbi observations are uniquely suited to testing this third possibility .",
    "many of the source properties observed with vlbi , including the apparent superluminal velocity , @xmath72 , depend on the angle of the jet to the line - of - sight , so in principle the jet orientation angles of the egret and non - egret sources can be compared .",
    "note that the egret and non - egret sources do not necessarily have a bimodal distribution in their ratio of @xmath4-ray flux to radio flux , as the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars do in their ratio of radio to optical flux ( e.g. rawlings 1994 ) .",
    "however , since mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that there is a correlation between average 5 ghz radio flux and peak @xmath4-ray flux , and many of the strongest radio blazars have not been detected by egret , there is at least a very large scatter in the ratio of @xmath4-ray flux to radio flux that remains to be explained .",
    "we decided to compare the average values of @xmath72 for the egret and non - egret sources to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups .",
    "we use the speeds of all vlbi components measured in this work , paper i , and paper ii , along with the collected apparent velocity data of vc94 and some more recent vlbi observations of the egret sources 0420 - 014 ( wagner et al .",
    "1995 ) , 0528 + 134 ( krichbaum et al . 1995 ; pohl et al . 1995 ) , and 1633 + 382 ( barthel et al . 1995 ) .",
    "recent observations of 1730 - 130 ( bower et al . 1997 ) are not included since the superluminal motion is only inferred from the timing of flux outbursts .",
    "a similar comparison has been done by tingay et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; however , we include the speeds of 15 new vlbi components measured in this paper , paper i , and paper ii  thus approximately doubling the available sample for egret sources  and we also use the data of vc94 somewhat differently . for the egret sources ,",
    "we exclude the bl lacs , and we consider only the core - dominated quasars from vc94 , because gabuzda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that the @xmath72 values of bl lacs and quasars are quite different .",
    "we also combine the apparent velocity data using weighted averaging , so we exclude any apparent velocity measurement published without an associated error . when multiple components have been measured in a single source ,",
    "we take the weighted average of the component speeds to form an average value for that source ; this is exactly equivalent to forming the weighted average of _ all _ components from _ all _ sources . since vc94 remark that the large number of stationary components found in core - dominated quasars implies that they probably represent a different phenomenon from the more rapidly moving components",
    ", we also exclude components where the velocity measurement and associated error are consistent with no motion .",
    "we find that the two groups of egret and non - egret sources have the same average apparent velocity of 5.5@xmath0 , with the standard deviations of the distributions being 2.7 and 2.4 @xmath0 respectively .",
    "histograms of these apparent velocities are shown in piner ( 1998 ) .",
    "we find no evidence that the egret and non - egret sources have different apparent velocities , in agreement with tingay et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "apparent velocity is probably not the best indicator of orientation .",
    "the graph of @xmath72 vs. @xmath51 has a maximum at @xmath77 , and below this maximum the apparent velocity decreases as the source moves closer to the line - of - sight .",
    "if a significant number of egret sources are located on the small angle side of this maximum , they could actually have a lower average apparent velocity than other sources while still being closer to the line - of - sight",
    ". a better indicator of orientation is a function which increases monotonically as the angle to the line - of - sight decreases , such as the doppler factor @xmath53 or the ratio of core to extended flux , or core dominance parameter , @xmath78 .",
    "we have investigated the average values of @xmath53 and @xmath78 for egret and non - egret sources using the values of @xmath56 from gpcm , dg95 , gd96 , guerra & daly ( 1997 ) , and this paper ; values of @xmath78 from gpcm , dg95 , and murphy et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; and using the set of egret sources from mukherjee et al .",
    "the average values for @xmath56 and @xmath78 of the egret and non - egret sources are given in table  [ deltar ] , where we have used the same source classifications used by gpcm .",
    "the average values of @xmath56 for the egret and non - egret sources are the same within the errors , which may simply reflect the large uncertainties in determining @xmath56 .",
    "the only significant difference in the @xmath78 values occurs for the lpqs , where the egret lpqs have an @xmath78 value significantly higher than the non - egret lpqs .",
    "this implies that the egret lpqs are more strongly beamed than the non - egret lpqs and , if degree of polarization increases with decreasing angle to the line - of - sight , implies that the egret lpqs have an angle to the line - of - sight typical of hpqs .",
    "since degree of polarization is variable , this suggests that the egret lpqs may really be hpqs which were classified during a low - polarization state .",

    "( 1994 ) for all sources where images were available in the literature , as well as using the new images from this paper , paper i , and paper ii .",
    "a complete listing of these misalignment angles is given by piner ( 1998 ) .",
    "we compared this misalignment angle distribution to that for hpqs in general using the results from the combined pearson & readhead and first caltech - jodrell bank surveys presented by xu et al .",

    "these results independently confirm similar results found recently by bower et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we do not find strong evidence that we are viewing @xmath4-ray sources any closer to the line - of - sight than is typical for an hpq source .",
    "moellenbrock et al . (",
    "1996 ) , in a survey of core - dominated radio sources , found that the @xmath4-ray sources occupy the high end of their brightness temperature distribution , indicating that the @xmath4-ray sources are among the most highly beamed in their sample .",
    "however , their sample includes both high and low polarization core - dominated quasars .",
    "unified schemes ( guerra & daly ( 1997 ) , tersranta & valtaoja ( 1994 ) ) indicate that lpqs typically have a larger angle to the line - of - sight than hpqs . if the ks test done by moellenbrock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is redone using only the hpq sources from their sample and the latest list of egret sources , the significance of the difference between the brightness temperature distributions of the egret and non - egret sources drops below 95% .",
    "we conclude that vlbi observations are consistent with the average opening angle for the @xmath4-ray emission being approximately equal to the average viewing angle for an hpq .",
    "if this is so , then the reason some hpqs are not seen in @xmath4-rays is probably due to intrinsic source differences or time variability .",
    "nair ( 1997 ) has stated that cluster analysis shows that @xmath4-ray sources have larger amplitudes of optical variability and are bluer at larger redshifts .",
    "punsly ( 1996 ) has found that @xmath4-ray quasars have larger mm spectral peaks relative to their cm spectral peaks than other core - dominated quasars .",
    "both of these may be evidence that there are some intrinsic differences between the egret and non - egret sources .",
    "we have presented vlbi images of the egret quasars 0202 + 149 , cta 26 , and 1606 + 106 .",
    "we have detected superluminal motion in two of these sources , cta 26 and 1606 + 106 ; such superluminal motion is expected from highly beamed @xmath4-ray blazars .",
    "the high doppler factor derived for 0202 + 149 also indicates that it is strongly beamed , the stationary jet components in this source can be interpreted as standing shocks or flow very close to the line - of - sight .",
    "the quasar 0202 + 149 satisfies all the criteria of the compact f double morphology class as given by pr88 .",
    "we have also investigated the shapes of the vlbi jets in all of these sources , as well as in 1156 + 295 , and have found they all possess apparently bent jets .",
    "we have detected non - radial motions of components in cta 26 and 1156 + 295 .",
    "it has been noted by some authors ( krichbaum et al .",
    "1995 ; wehrle et al .",
    "1996 ) , and is expected from some theoretical models , that vlbi components appear subsequent to @xmath4-ray flares .",
    "we have not yet detected any components emerging subsequent to the @xmath4-ray flares in cta 26 , 1156 + 295 , and 1606 + 106 , although the only source which has a lower limit on the ejection time of such a component that is significantly later than the @xmath4-ray flare in that source is 1156 + 295 .",
    "the observations of the three sources presented here , along with the observations of 1611 + 343 and 1156 + 295 presented in papers i and ii , significantly increase the number of egret sources for which detailed vlbi monitoring data are available .",
    "such an increase makes comparisons between properties of the egret and non - egret populations more significant .",
    "we have compared the misalignment angle distribution of egret sources to the distribution for blazars as a whole and find that the egret sources do not preferentially belong to the aligned or the misaligned population .",
