    "in the recent years , quantum phase transitions @xcite have been paid considerable attentions within various fields of physics because they can provide valuable information about novel types of matter that emerge in the vicinity of the absolute zero temperature .",
    "examples that have been studied both theoretically and experimentally include high-@xmath0 superconductors , fractional quantum hall liquids , quantum magnets , mott - insulators etc .",
    "unlike thermal phase transitions that occur at finite temperatures and are driven by thermal fluctuations , quantum phase transitions occur at the absolute zero temperature and are driven solely by quantum fluctuations .",
    "conventionally , quantum phase transitions are characterized by singularities of the ground - state energy .",
    "the order of transitions is defined by discontinuities ( or singularities ) occurring in the @xmath1th - order derivative of the energy .",
    "for instance , the second - order quantum phase transition corresponds to the discontinuity ( or singularities ) in the second derivative of the energy .",
    "such a characterization is intrinsically inherited from traditional studies on thermal phase transitions since the finite - temperature free energy becomes the ground - state energy in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "theoretical frameworks , such as landau - ginzburg - wilson spontaneous symmetry - breaking theory , have been used to understand continuous quantum phase transitions too . in landau",
    "s paradigm , local order operators and their correlation functions play a central role in studies on quantum phase transitions .",
    "the nonvanishing value of the order parameter at long distance characterizes a symmetry - breaking phase , a unique feature which exists only for a system with infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , a huge interest was raised in the attempt of characterizing quantum phase transitions in terms of the concepts borrowed from quantum information science @xcite . due to the mutual relation between fluctuations and correlations , people are curious about the role of entanglement , a pure quantum correlation existing uniquely in quantum systems , in those transitions driven solely by quantum fluctuations .",
    "hundreds of work ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) have been published since the two original works finished by osterloh _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and osborne and nielsen @xcite , respectively .",
    "though a unified theory on the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions is still unavailable , some definitive conclusions have been commonly accepted @xcite .",
    "another promising approach to quantum phase transitions is based on quantum fidelity , a concept emerging also in quantum information science .",
    "the fidelity measures the similarity between two ground states , hence is excepted to show a dramatic change across the transition points @xcite .",
    "this motivated people to start exploring its role played in quantum phase transitions ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "as the fidelity is a space geometrical quantity , no a priori knowledge of the order parameter and symmetry breaking of the system is assumed , it is a great advantage to study quantum phase transitions using the fidelity approach .",
    "experimentally , however , to study the ground - state entanglement and fidelity in quantum many - body systems is still a challenging problem .",
    "the nuclear - magnetic - resonance quantum simulator , though is promising , can only measure entanglement @xcite and the fidelity jzhangprl100501,jzhang08081536 in few - body systems ( for instance spin dimer ) .",
    "the critical phenomena , such as scaling properties and various critical exponents , are not able to be studied in experiments yet .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to study quantum criticality based on the entropy majorization theorem @xcite , an important theorem in quantum information science .",
    "our motivation originates from three facts :    1 .",
    "a true quantum phase transition occurs at the absolute zero temperature , which , however , can not be reached rigorously in experiments . to understand the ground - state properties ,",
    "experiments are usually done at low or untra - low temperatures .",
    "therefore , it is useful to develop a proposal to study quantum phase transitions by considering the effects of temperature .",
    "the ground state can not be isolated from the corresponding low - lying excitations also . from this point of view",
    ", the change in the low - energy spectra @xcite plays an important role for understanding quantum critical phenomena .",
    "3 .   at low temperatures",
    ", the entropy majorization theorem manifests that the entropy is significantly enhanced around the critical point due to a higher density of state nearby . while the entropy is also required to be conserved in adiabatic processes because there is not heat transfer during the process . in order to satisfy the entropy conservation law in the adiabatic process",
    ", the temperature has to be suppressed and the _ adiabatic inverse temperature _ ( denoting the inverse temperature in adiabatic processes ) might even become singular at the critical point .",
    "our general motivation will be proved via the entropy majorization theorem , and then confirmed by concrete examples , including a simple two - level system , the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model , and the one - dimensional spinless fermion system .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : warm - up ] , we give a warm - up example to show explicitly that the adiabatic inverse temperature will become singular when a ground - state level - crossing occurs . in section [ sec : major ] , we show that , based on the entropy majorization theorem , the significant change in the low - energy spectra might lead to a singular adiabatic inverse temperature around the quantum critical point . in section [ sec : ising ] , we take the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model as an example to show that the adiabatic inverse temperature becomes singular around the critical point . in section [ sec : fermions ] , we study the thermodynamics of the one - dimensional spinless fermion system at low temperatures , and show explicitly that the adiabatic inverse temperature is divergent at the quantum phase transition point . in section [ sec : diss ] , we discuss potential application of our motivation to experiments .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "and @xmath2 .",
    "contour lines in the @xmath3 plane denote the adiabatic evolution paths.,width=302 ]    to begin with , we first have a look at a two - level toy model describing a free spin in an external field as a warm - up example .",
    "the model s hamiltonian reads as @xmath4where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-component of pauli matrices @xmath7 . in the 1/2 spin basis @xmath8",
    ", the hamiltonian is already diagonal and the corresponding eigenenergies are @xmath9therefore , if @xmath10 , the ground state is @xmath11 ; while if @xmath12 , the ground state becomes @xmath13 .",
    "a simple first - order quantum phase transition induced by the ground - state level - crossing occurs at the transition point @xmath14 .",
    "the quantum phase transition occurring in such a two - level system looks rather trivial .",
    "however , it captures one of the most important properties in quantum critical phenomena , a vanishing energy gap ( or more generally a significant change in the density of state ) .",
    "suppose the absolute zero temperature is unavailable , the thermal equilibrium state , according to quantum statistical mechanics can only be described by a thermal density matrix .",
    "for the present system , the thermal density matrix at a temperature @xmath15 , with the boltzmann constant @xmath16 , is @xmath17where@xmath18is the partition function . from the thermal density matrix , we can see that the probability of two states are@xmath19respectively .",
    "therefore , the entropy of the system reads @xmath20now we suppose the system adiabatically envolves from @xmath21 and @xmath22 to @xmath23 with @xmath24 . during the adiabatic process , the system s entropy is required to be conserved , i.e. @xmath25 , hence@xmath26 in this expression , the only relevant parameter that changes the entropy is @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , to fix the entropy , we need only to fix @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29such that @xmath30we can see clearly that the adiabatic inverse temperature @xmath31 becomes divergent as @xmath32 tends to zero .",
    "that is , if we change the external field slowly enough , the temperature will become zero at the transition point .    as a numerical demonstration ,",
    "we show , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2levelentropy.eps ] , the thermal entropy of the two - level system as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath31 , and its contour map on the @xmath33 plane .",
    "the lines on the contour map denote adiabatic paths along which the system evolves , from which we can judge that the adiabatic inverse temperature is divergent around @xmath34 .",
    "the discussion in the above two - level system shows a clear picture that the change in energy spectra around the critical point might lead to a divergent adiabatic inverse temperature . in this section , we want to generalize this picture to an arbitrary quantum many - body system .",
    "we consider a general quantum many - body system described by the hamiltonian @xmath35where @xmath36 is the driving hamiltonian and @xmath37 denotes its strength . without loss of generality ,",
    "a quantum phase transition is supposed to occur in the system s ground state @xmath38 at the critical @xmath39 .",
    "since there is no rigorous ground state in experiments , the thermal equilibrium state of the system at a high @xmath40 ( hence low @xmath41 ) , according quantum statistical physics , can be expressed as a density matrix @xmath42here @xmath43 which satisfy@xmath44define a set of orthogonal complete basis , and @xmath45is the partition function .",
    "the entropy of the system then can be expressed as@xmath46here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the internal energy and the free energy respecticaly , and @xmath49where @xmath50 and with@xmath51@xmath52 occurs iff @xmath53 .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the entropy of the system can be written as@xmath54 \\rho ( \\epsilon ) d\\epsilon , \\]]where @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the system size , and @xmath57 denotes the density of state at @xmath58 .",
    "now we are going to show that a significant change in the density of state around the ground state will change the temperature or the entropy , depending on which one keeps constant .",
    "the change of density of state includes but not limit to a vanishing gap around the critical point @xcite or emergence of a van hove singularity at the ground state @xcite .",
    "we consider the system at two points @xmath37 and @xmath59 in the parameter space . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath60 is closer to the critical point @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath61 , and the temperature is the same .",
    "so there are two thermal probability distributions @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath37 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the low - temperature properties of the system are determined by both the ground state and the low - lying excitations , we need to consider only their contributions to the entropy of the system .",
    "since the system is gapped and the gap is assumed to vanish at the critical point , we have @xmath65 . defining @xmath66we have@xmath67 where @xmath68 is a cutoff .",
    "therefore , there exists a range in the energy space , in which that@xmath69such that @xmath70for @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath68 can be finite or even as large as the dimension of the whole hilbert space depending on both the temperature and the normalization condition of the boltzmann distribution .",
    "if the temperature is low enough , contributions from those eigenstates above @xmath72 are neglectable .",
    "therefore , in such a region , we can say the distribution @xmath73 majorizes @xmath74 @xcite . since @xmath73 and @xmath75 denote the probability distribution , we have , according to the entropy majorization theorem @xcite @xmath76the inequality manifests that the entropy increases as the energy gap vanishes .    on the other hand , the thermal entropy is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature , to ensure the entropy to be conserved during adiabatic processes , the temperature @xmath41 at @xmath59 must be lower than that at @xmath37 , hence the adiabatic inverse temperature @xmath77 increases . to see the singularity of the adiabatic inverse temperature ,",
    "the starting temperature before the adiabatic evolution must be low enough such that the boltzmann probability of the ground state @xmath78 is finite , say 1/10 which does not vanish even in the thermodynamic limit . in this case",
    ", the system s entropy usually is intensive given there is no singularity in the density of state below @xmath79",
    ". then if the energy gap is closed , the density of state becomes continuous around the ground state ( see top right of fig . [",
    "fig : dos.eps ] ) , the adiabatic inverse temperature becomes divergent .",
    "otherwise the entropy would be extensive ( divergent as @xmath80 ) if @xmath31 is still finite .",
    "generally , the significant change in the density of state is not limited to the case of a vanishing gap .",
    "a straightforward example is the emergence of a van hove singularity at the ground state ( see bottom right of fig .",
    "fig : dos.eps ) .",
    "this case usually occurs as the low - lying excitations dispersion is , though gapless , intrinsically changed around the critical point , for instance from linear to quadratic .",

    "( [ eq : vonentropy2 ] ) must be enhanced . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath85 is divergent at the critical point , @xmath40 is expected to be divergent too .",
    "quantum phase transitions occurring in few - body systems are usually induced by the ground - state level - crossing .",
    "nevertheless , most interesting critical phenomena occur in thermodynamic systems where the singularity is due to the infinite degree of freedom in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "that is , in these cases , the ground - state properties do not show any singular behavior for a finite sample .",
    "then the scaling analysis becomes very important .",
    "here we now take the landau - zener model @xcite to illustrate the such a picture .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads as@xmath88 in the basis @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes @xmath56-dependent hoping amplitute between two levels .",

    "the energy gap between two states are @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 is finite , the energy gap is always finite .",
    "this case corresponds to a finite system .",
    "however , if @xmath90 vanishes in the infinite @xmath56 limit , for instance @xmath96 with @xmath97 , a quantum phase transition then occurs at @xmath98 .",

    "such a phase transition is believed to be well characterized by the landau - ginzburg - wilson spontaneous symmetry - breaking paradigm . moreover , due to its simplicity and exact solvability , the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model becomes one of the most popular models for studying quantum phase transitions .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads as@xmath104where @xmath32 is the transverse field and @xmath56 is the number of spins .",
    "as implied from the model s name , the hamiltonian describes a chain of spins with the nearest - neighboring ising interaction along @xmath105-direction , and all spins are subject to a transverse magnetic field @xmath32 along @xmath6-direction .",

    ", we first can see that the thermal entropy is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath40 , this observation is consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "secondly , the thermal entropy decreases more quickly in the both gapped phase , while rather slowly around the critical point .",
    "such a difference is due to the gap protection in the non - critical region .",
    "thirdly , if we fix @xmath40 , we can see that the entropy increases significantly at the transition point .",
    "the physics behind the phenomenon is the entropy majorization theorem as we discussed in section [ sec : major ] .",
    "finally , that of significant importance is the contour map of the thermal entropy on the @xmath118 plane .",
    "clearly , a single line on the contour map denotes an isoline of the thermal entropy .",

    "in this section , we consider a quantum phase transition induced by continuous level - crossing , as illustrated by the one - dimensional spinless fermion system subject to a chemical potential .",
    "such a phase transition is basically different from that occurring in the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model .",
    "the later is due to the avoided level - crossing , while the former is caused by the continuous ground - state level - crossing .",

    "secondly , let the system adiabatically evolve to the another phase . according to the above motivation",

    "clearly @xmath146 reaches a maximum at @xmath34 if @xmath31sgn@xmath147const , so the internal energy increases as the system tends to the critical point .",

    "therefore , if we extract the ground - state energy from the internal energy , the system does  do work \" to surroundings . in any case",
    ", a potential issue might be that if such a cooling technique is experimentally useful to reach ultra - low temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have found that the quantum criticality can be detected by a low - temperature adiabatic process .",
    "the combination of the entropy majorization theorem in quantum information science and the adiabatic theorem in statistical physics manifests that the adiabatic inverse temperature might become singular at the critical point due to the significant change of the low - lying energy spectra around the critical point .",
    "such a straightforward motivation has been illustrated by two simple quantum phase transitions occurring in the ground state of the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model and spinless fermion system respectively .",

    ", the temperature should be comparably lower than the gap . while for the quantum phase transition discussed in section sec : fermions , since the transition is related to the singularity in the density of the state , the starting temperature in the non - polarized phase should not be larger enough to excite the state around the singular point .",
