    ", submitted ) . given that the sfr methods used in this work probe fundamentally different timescales , galaxies which have undergone recent changes to their star - formation , will have intrinsically different sfr when measured using different methods ( @xmath4 see",
    "* ) . by excluding pair / group galaxies , we aim to remove sources which have had recent changes to their star formation , and thus aim to restrict our sample to galaxies which have intrinsically the same sfr , irrespective of the timescale a particular sfr method probes .",
    "while there will still be sources within our sample that have undergone recent changes to their star formation ( in particular remaining members of pairs where the other pair galaxy falls below our survey limit and thus the system is not identified as such ) , the general trends of the population should display consistent intrinsic sfrs .",
    "in fact , once calibrated to each other to remove systematic offsets ( as we do here ) , scatter between sfrs from different indicators may potentially be a sign of short timescale variations in star formation history .",
    "to reveal such temporal variations would also require a high fidelity for correction of dust attenuation on an object - by - object basis , due to the very small intrinsic scatter of individual galaxies in the sfr - m@xmath0 relation for the spiral galaxies used here .",
    "note that we do not exclude sources which are undetected in a particular indicator , but use the full sample defined above for our re - calibrations .",
    "the gama analysis provides a measurement for all indicators / methods for every source in the grootes et al sample , albeit some which are consistent with zero , but with realistic errors . as such , some indicators ( @xmath5 those using mir - fir data )",
    "will have derived sfrs with large errors ( and consistent with zero sfr ) at the low luminosity end .",
    "as detailed in the description of the fitting process in section [ sec : com_ind ] , we address this issue by raising the lower limit in stellar mass in the shallowest indicators ( w4 and 100@xmath31 m ) .",
    "this ensures that noise - dominated data never dominates the statistical analysis in any part of the stellar mass range .    finally , it is important to note that the final sample encompasses a full range of objects with differing dust content and dust opacities .",
    "thus it avoids bias in inter - comparing methods for determining sfr from dust - reradiated starlight with methods from direct measurements of starlight .",
    "such bias would arise if one were to select the sample for statistical comparison according to detectability in the sfr indicators themselves , especially where disk opacity is a strong function of stellar mass and luminosity .",
    "in this work we use multiple methods for determining sfrs and derive new luminosity - sfr calibrations .",
    "initially we explore all sfr methods available in the gama ii@xmath25 sample , using previously published ( or in preparation ) gama sfr calibrations . while there is a wide breadth of varying sfr calibrations for each observable in the literature ( @xmath4",

    "we detail each method for determining sfrs , the observable emission from which it is derived , and the physical process from which the emission is produced .",
    "ultimately , all the methods - irrespective of whether the observable is directly starlight , dust - reradiated starlight , or nebular line emission - quantitatively link the observable to the intrinsic emission from hot stars ( @xmath5 as would be observed in the absence of dust ) .",
    "a major part of each method is therefore concerned with how the corrections for dust attenuation are made .    in this section ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use photometry measured by the lambda adaptive multi - band deblending algorithm for r ( lambdar * ? ? ?",

    "h@xmath8 photons arise from gas ionised by the stellar radiation field , and only stars with ages @xmath3220myr can contribute significantly to this ionizing flux .",

    "this is potentially the case , as aperture corrections are likely to be larger for higher mass galaxies ( due to their larger physical size ) and the scatter on the h@xmath8 and [ oii ] relations increases with stellar mass .",

    "however , this is not apparent for w4 .",
    "potentially the w3 calibration has an in built systematic offset which is most dominant at the low mass end , as we will see such offsets will be removed during the analysis in this paper .",
    "another possible explanation is a decline in the strength of pah features ( which is a function of both the strength of the uv radiation field and also of the abundance of pah molecules ) in lower mass galaxies driving the steep slope and large errors at the low mass end .",
    "a reduction in pah abundance can be caused either chemical effects ( @xmath4 a lowering in c / h abundance versus stellar mass ) or physical effects ( @xmath4 a more intense and harder uv interstellar radiation field in low mass disk galaxies as compared to high mass disk galaxies - increasing the rate pah are destroyed in the interstellar medium ) .",

    "it should be noted that the use of the spread in slopes and normalisations of the relations in figure [ fig : ms_fits ] as a quantitative measure of the efficacy of the various methods used to derive sfrs ( point 4 , above ) , will always preferentially favour methods leading to a relation between log(sfr ) and log(m@xmath0 ) that has the same linear functional form assumed by hyperfit for the sample of spiral galaxies we use . in this sense",
    "our result that the rt method reduces the spread in slopes and normalisations more than the other methods is consistent with the analysis of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation between specific sfr and m@xmath0 by grootes et al .",
    "( submitted ) , also using the rt technique .",
    "that analysis revealed an almost perfect power law relation between 10@xmath100m@xmath48 for the same sample of disk - dominated spiral galaxies as used in the present work .",
    "as discussed in section 4 and by grootes et al .",
    "( submitted ) , one reason for the linearity may be that this is a fundamental linear relation pertaining only to the disk component of spiral galaxies .",
    "the sample selection using the morphological proxies selects against early type spirals , with an increased fraction of bulge light affecting m@xmath0 but contributing little to the uv output of the galaxies .",
    "thus , the possible steepening of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation at high mass measured in other samples ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may potentially be due to the increasing predominance of high mass spheroidal components in more massive spiral galaxies .",
    "another major factor influencing the linearity of the relation between log(sfr ) and log(m@xmath0 ) is the changing effect of dust attenuation as a function of stellar mass in spiral galaxies .",
    "this affects both the escape fraction of uv light as well as the appearance of dust - reradiated optical and uv starlight .",
    "these both depend on the geometrical distributions of stars and dust in the galaxy , as well as the amount of dust , as a function of m@xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the transformation between raw measurements in any sfr indicator , and the true sfrs is not predicted to be well described by any simple functional form .",
    "the apparent high fidelity of the @xcite radiation transfer model used here in predicting the variation of dust attenuation in the nuv as a function of m@xmath0 along the sfr - m@xmath0 relation , is consistent with the model itself and its associated empirical constraints , having predictive power for deattenuating spiral galaxies over all the range of m@xmath0 considered here .",
    "in particular the @xcite model makes use of the relative spatial distributions of old and young stellar populations and associated dust components derived from radiation transfer modelling of nearby highly resolved massive edge - on spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "these are combined here with the empirical calibration of face - on dust surface density as a function of stellar mass surface density by @xcite , making use of measurements of disk size and orientation derived from single - sersic fits to the optical images of each gama target galaxy in the sample        in summary , our resultant recommended observed luminosity - to - sfr calibrations are those based on the rt method , and have the form :    @xmath88 = m(log_{10}[l(unit)]-l_{f})+c},\\ ] ]    where parameters for each indicator are given in table [ tab : pars ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : slope ]    these fits show clear variation in slope and normalisation across our redshift range - with the normalisation increasing and slope appearing to flatten to higher redshifts . to compare this evolution to previous results at higher redshifts , we take the slope and normalisation at log@xmath90[m / m@xmath48]=10.0 and compare to the parameterisations of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation given in @xcite - using data in the cosmos region .",
    "we select log@xmath90[m / m@xmath48]=10.0 as our normalisation point , as it falls above the incompleteness limits in all of our redshift samples , and is largely in the linear region of the @xcite parameterisations .",
    "we then determine the lee et al normalisation at this point using their equation 2 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : normalization ] displays the combined evolution of the normalisation of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation at log@xmath90[m / m@xmath48]=10.0 from our work and the @xcite study .",
    "errors on the normalisation from our sample are estimated for the hyperfit fitting error and are smaller than the points .",
    "we also over - plot points derived from the ssfr evolution in @xcite - which are consistent with both our and the @xcite results .",
    "we find a relatively tight linear relations of the normalisation from @xmath101 , covering the last 8.5gyr of evolution , with the form :    @xmath102 = 4.0log_{10}[1+z]-0.02}\\ ] ]    this highlights that there is relatively smooth declining evolution in the sfr - m@xmath0 relation since @xmath103 , which is consistent with results from the evolution of the cosmic star - formation history ( @xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which to first order , has been linearly decreasing since @xmath104 .",
    "we also plot the fit for the evolution of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation from @xcite , who use a detailed compilation of 25 different samples to evaluate the sfr - m@xmath0 relation out to @xmath105 .",
    "we use their best fit relation for at log@xmath90[m / m@xmath48]=10.0 and find that our results consistent with the @xcite fits over the redshift range probed .",
    "we also compare the power law slope of our sfr - m@xmath0 evolution with that determined by @xcite - right panel of figure [ fig : normalization ] . while lee et al propose an increasing slope with look - back time , we in fact find the opposite , with the sfr - m@xmath0 relation becoming shallower to higher redshift .",
    "however , this is potentially due to eddington bias @xcite , due to increasing incompleteness in our samples at higher redshifts both in stellar mass and sfr .",
    "similar effects have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite , who find that increasing incompleteness in high-@xmath10 samples leads to a flattening of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation . to test this",
    ", we take our @xmath106 distribution , apply sfr cuts which are similar to the selection limits in the higher redshift bins and re - fit the distribution .",
    "we find that the slope of these fits decreases in a similar manner to the evolution of the slope seen at higher redshifts - as such , this is likely to be driven by eddington bias .",
    "however , deeper , higher redshift spectroscopic samples , such as the upcoming wide area vista extragalactic survey - deep @xcite , will be required to fully probe the changing slope of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation at these epoch .",
    "taking this further , we can also explore the global evolution of sfr in the local universe . as discussed previously , the csfh is a fundamental measurement of the process of galaxy evolution , probing the changing density of star - formation as the universe evolves ( @xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "this distribution contains invaluable information about the underlying processes which shape the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the csfh has been well established over the past two decades from numerous studies , albeit with large scatter from different data sets ( see summaries in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - showing an increase in sfr density to @xmath6 and a slow decrease at later times .",
    "@xcite have produced a robust parameterisation of the csfh for both salpeter - like and @xcite imfs using a compendium of measurements across the last 12.5gyr of universal history .",
    "due to both the selection of target sources in the gama survey ( @xmath107 ) and the @xmath45-band limits of the sdss data used to derive our sfr , our star - forming samples are likely to be incomplete , and this incompleteness will vary as a function of redshift . to estimate this incompleteness , we use a similar method to that outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we first determine the appropriate @xmath45-band apparent magnitude limit of our samples at each redshift using the @xmath108 vs @xmath45 colour distributions shown in the third row of figure [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "note that the u - r colours displayed in these panels are not obscuration corrected ( but are k - corrected ) as applying obscuration corrections is not appropriate when determining observability incompleteness .",
    "the dashed diagonal line in these figures displays the @xmath107 gama selection limit .",
    "we identify the modal point of the star - forming distribution in @xmath108 colour ( dashed horizontal line ) and find the intercept of this point with the @xmath107 selection limit - giving the appropriate @xmath45-band limit for each epoch ( dashed vertical line ) .",
    "we exclude sources at fainter absolute @xmath45-band magnitudes than this limit . for all remaining sources",
    "we calculate the standard 1/v@xmath109 correction for both the @xmath107 and derived @xmath45-band limits . above",
    "/ below the horizontal dashed @xmath108 line our sample will be incomplete due to the @xmath45-band/@xmath28-band limits respectively .",
    "as such , we use the appropriate 1/v@xmath109 for each galaxy depending on its @xmath108 colour , and calculate the resultant star formation rate density function ( sfrdf ) at each epoch ( bottom row of figure [ fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "volumes for each redshift are given in table [ tab : slope ] .",
    "we find that the sfrdf is bounded in our three lowest redshift bins ( @xmath5 the contribution to the sfr density rises to a peak and then decreases with decreasing sfr ) , but unbounded at the highest redshifts .",
    "this suggests that we can not reasonably measure the sfr density in our highest redshift bin .",
    "somewhat unsurprisingly , we also find that the dominant contribution to star - formation in the @xmath110 universe arises from systems with moderate sfrs ( @xmath111m@xmath48yr@xmath16 ) .",
    "while the 1/v@xmath109 method corrects to weight sources that have been identified , it does not allow correction for sources which are completely undetected in our sample . to account for these sources , we assume that the star formation rate density function has a similar shape at all epochs .",
    "we fit the @xmath112 sfrdf within the bounds of the red shaded region in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : evolution ] , using a spline fit with 8 degrees of freedom ( found to be a good representation of the data ) .",
    "we then retain the same shape as the @xmath112 sfrdf , and apply a least squares fit for the x - offset and normalisation at higher redshifts , using only data points in the region where our sfrdf measurements are complete - the blue shaded regions . for reference ,",
    "we also over - plot the red and blue shaded regions in the top row of figure [ fig : evolution ] to highlight that the fitted region is well within the bounds of the observed galaxy distribution prior to corrections .",
    "we note that we aim to fit our highest redshift bin , but highlight that as the distribution is unbounded , any derived measurement is not robust .      to calculate the cosmic star - formation history ( csfh ) we integrate each of the sfrdf fits to obtain a total sfrd at each epoch - given in table [ tab : slope ] .",
    "the dominant source of error in our sfdr measurements is likely to be cosmic variance ( cv ) .",
    "we estimate the @xmath84 error induced by cv in the gama regions from @xcite as 13% , 11% , 8% and 5% in our four redshift bins respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : csfh ] shows a compendium of the csfh using multiple different surveys and techniques .",
    "the grey points display the summary of results noted in @xcite , which we supplement with more recent results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our new gama u - band derived sfrd points are shown as red circles - where we highlight our highest redshift bin ( where our measurement is not robust ) as an open circle . all previous datasets and fits",
    "are scaled to a chabrier imf .",
    "we over - plot the @xcite fits and find that our results are largely consistent with the previous parametrisation in the @xmath1 range - we find that the @xcite relation slightly over predicts the csfh at @xmath113 in comparison to our new data and previous results .",
    "this is also consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that the @xcite relation over predicts the data at these epochs .",
    "lastly , we also display the fit to the csfh from the summary of @xcite , and find it is also largely consistent with our new measurements . for consistency , we also produce the csfh in an identical manner using the h@xmath8-calibrated @xmath45-band sfrs , and find that we obtain sfrd measurements which are @xmath110.1dex higher than our current measurements . highlighting that our sfrd measurements are not strongly sensitive to choice of ` gold standard ' calibrator .",
    "given the additional data since the @xcite relation was fit , we now supplement the data used in @xcite with the more recent results ( excluding the * ? ? ?",
    "* points which are likely to suffer from incompleteness ) and our own new sfrds ( excluding our highest redshift data point ) , and re - derive the csfh ( for details of the datasets used in the previous fits , please refer to * ? ? ?",
    "we use the same functional form as @xcite , taken originally from @xcite with :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 .",
    "we then perform a least squares regression to fit this relation to all data at @xmath116 ( where we have robust measurements of the sfrd ) and derive parameters :    @xmath117    note that these fitting parameters are only reliable in the @xmath116 range .",
    "we do not quote errors as they are extremely co - variant .",
    "our fitted values do not deviate significantly for the @xcite relation , but marginally reduce the sfrd at @xmath116 bringing the fitted relation into line with the more recent results .",
    "we have investigated 12 different sfr methods available to the gama survey . by taking a well - defined sample of local spiral galaxies ,",
    "we compare and contrast each sfr indicator / method against each other and find that they have large scatter , as well as normalisation and slope offsets - suggesting that they are not well calibrated to each other . to produce consistent sfr measurements across all indicators we re - calibrate all sfr metrics to a common relation .",
    "we re - define all literature luminosity to sfr calibrations assuming each base sfr to be correct in turn .",
    "we find that the most consistent slopes and normalisations of the sfr - m * relations found using different sfr indicators are obtained when the indicators are recalibrated using sfrs derived from the radiation transfer method of @xcite in conjunction with the opacity - stellar surface mass density relation of @xcite .",
    "we use the sfr - m@xmath0 relation as a metric of success of our calibrations , and find that our recommended calibrations reduce the scatter on the relation for all sfr indicators and produce consistent sfr - m@xmath0 relation slopes and normalisation .",
    "we also show that our new calibrations reduce scatter and systematic offsets when comparing sfr measurements directly - suggesting that they are robust in directly comparing sfrs across multiple observables . for reference",
    ", we also provide luminosity to sfr calibrations for all possible combinations of base sfr and indicator .",
    "these calibrations can now be used to compare sfrs over a broad range of different observations , probing different epochs , environments and galaxy populations , to return a consistent measure of star formation .    using our newly derived sfrs we investigate the evolution of star - formation in the local universe .",
    "we apply our new calibrations for @xmath45-band sfr to the full gama ii@xmath25 sample and investigate the evolution of the slope and normalisation of the sfr - m@xmath0 relation .",
    "we compare this to results at higher redshift and find that the normalisation evolves linearly over the last 8.5gyr ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we calculate the sfrd at four epochs and correct for incompleteness in our sample .",
    "we find that the sfrd derived from our new @xmath45-band sfr calibrations is largely consistent with the @xcite and @xcite parameterisations of the csfh .",
    "these results highlight that our new sfr calibrations are robust in deriving physical quantities of galaxy populations .",
    "lastly , we update the @xcite relation fits to include post-2006 data , including our new results , to find a slightly lower sfrd at @xmath118 - this parameterisation now supersedes the previous relation .",

    "considering all aspects of the radiation transfer model of @xcite we identify three main components to the uncertainty in the sfrs derived in this application of the model .",
    "these are errors related to measurement errors in disk angular sizes , errors related to uncertainties in the fixed vertical heights of the nuv - emitting stars and dust in the geometrical model , and errors related to the escape fraction of nuv light from star - forming regions in the disk .",
    "these errors dominate the uncertainties arising from random measurement errors in the galex nuv photometry , for the mass and redshift range of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "we first consider the effect of measurement errors in the value for the single - sersic effective radius , r@xmath119 , of the disk .",
    "measurements of r@xmath119 are used to convert dust masses into face - on b - band central optical depth , @xmath120 , following the method of @xcite .",
    "while random errors in r@xmath119 arising from noise on the optical images quoted by kelvin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are small , we expect larger systematic errors due to i ) the effect of dust on the perceived optical morphology , ii ) the possible presence of a bulge on single - component sersic fits of disks , and iii ) the effect of fitting a 2-dimensional analytic function which can not describe the projection of the actual 3-dimensional emissivity distribution .",
    "all these systematic effects have been extensively simulated and documented by @xcite , and corrected for in our analysis , as described in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , residual errors will remain - for example due to likely variations in intrinsic bulge - to - disk ratios between galaxies which can not be modelled by single - sersic fits .",
    "an upper limit to the effect of these residual errors on @xmath120 is given by the observed scatter in @xmath120 about the opacity - stellar surface density relation of @xcite at high stellar mass densities , which is found to be around 0.1dex ( 1@xmath121 ) .",
    "for a typical galaxy of stellar mass 2 @xmath122 10@xmath123m@xmath48 and @xmath120=3.0 , viewed at the median inclination of 60deg , this translates into a 1@xmath121 uncertainty in sfr ( determined from the nuv ) of 0.07dex .",
    "the second main component to the error relates to uncertainties in the assumed form and parameter values for the geometrical distribution of dust relative to that of the uv stellar emissivity in the two disk model of the radiation transfer method .",
    "one such uncertainty relates to the fact that we are applying an axisymmetric model which also ignores the structure due to spiral arms .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , and the comparison between the 3- and 2-dimensional models by @xcite , this appears to have only a relatively small effect on the predicted escape fraction of the integrated uv light from spiral galaxies .",
    "more important for the present application are uncertainties in the fixed relative scale heights of the uv - emitting star - forming disk and the dust disks - which in the model of @xcite are based on resolved observations of nearby edge - on spiral galaxies by @xcite and on the thickness of the star - forming molecular layer in the milky way .",
    "uncertainties in the scale heights will affect both the attenuation of uv light in disks seen face on , as well as the inclination dependence of the attenuation .",
    "@xcite has verified that that the geometry calibrated in this way is consistent with the observed attenuation - inclination relation of spiral galaxies in the uv , including the dependence on stellar mass of this relation .",
    "this demonstrates that systematic errors may be limited .",
    "nevertheless , random variations in the relative scale heights of the stellar and dust disks are expected , and these will contribute to a random error in attenuation , and hence sfr . if the observed range of scaleheight of optically emitting stars and associated dust layer derived through radiation transfer analysis of nearby highly resolved edge - on spiral galaxies by @xcite and by @xcite is also indicative of the range of scaleheights of uv - emitting stars and associated dust , variations of up to a factor of 2 from the mean relative scaleheights of uv - emitting stars to the associated dust layer may be possible . for a typical galaxy of stellar mass 2@xmath12210@xmath123m@xmath48 and @xmath120=3 , such a shift in the vertical geometry would change the measured nuv flux by @xmath1240.04dex .",
    "the final main component of the uncertainty in sfrs derived using the rt method relates to uncertainties in the escape fraction of observed emission in the nuv - band from massive stars arising from the birth clouds . in the present calculation ,",
    "the escape fractions as a function of rest frame uv wavelength are taken from table e.4 of @xcite , corresponding to a clumpiness factor @xmath125=0.35 in the model . however , it is possible that the clumpiness factor varies between galaxies , which would induce a scatter in the returned values for sfr about their true values . indeed , radiative transfer modelling of direct and dust - radiated light of spiral galaxies by @xcite does show a variation of @xmath125 by of order @xmath12430@xmath126 between galaxies .",
    "this would translate into a variation in derived sfr of @xmath1240.04dex .    summing these three components of uncertainties in sfr in quadrature ,",
    "yields an estimate for the total uncertainty in the rt method to be around 0.09dex .",
    "this may be a lower limit to the total uncertainty if other effects are present that we have not taken into account , but can not readily quantify , such as deviations in the radial distribution of dust with galactocentric radius in galaxies from the exponential functional form used in the @xcite model . a conservative upper limit to the error",
    "is given by the residual scatter at fixed m@xmath0 in the ssfr vs. m@xmath0 for spiral galaxies of typically 0.27dex",
    "( 1@xmath121 ) found by grootes et al .",
    "( 2016 , submitted ) after having applied the same rt technique on the same sample of non - grouped non - interacting galaxies used in this work .",
    "however , the large difference between the residual scatter of 0.27dex and the estimated error of 0.09dex suggests that much of the residual scatter is in fact intrinsic , caused by real variations in the sfr at fixed m@xmath0 , rather than being due to unaccounted uncertainties in the correction for dust attenuation .",
    "finally , it is instructive to compare this lower limit of 0.09dex in uncertainty in sfr with the reduction in scatter at fixed m@xmath0 of the ssfr vs. m@xmath0 relation for this galaxy sample , as effected by this implementation of the rt technique .",
    "this reduction is from 0.36dex to 0.27dex ( grootes et al .",
    "2016 submitted ) . from this",
    ", one may infer that the component of scatter in sfr at fixed m@xmath0 in the uncorrected ssfr vs. m@xmath0 relation due to dust attenuation in the nuv is at least 0.24dex for a spiral of stellar mass 2 @xmath122 10@xmath123m@xmath48 ."
