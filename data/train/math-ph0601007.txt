    "the gauss model extends to entire functions of order  @xmath3 , provided one incorporates a background field coming from the exponential factors of the hadamard factorization of the function . for such functions",
    "there is a general phenomenon that differentiation smooths out irregularities in the distribution of zeros .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "if the zeros are located in a strip around the real axis and their initial distribution is not too irregular , then repeated differentiation leads the zeros to approach equal spacing .",
    "this regular spacing is known as the _ crystalline configuration _",
    "@xcite and we view the process of repeated differentiation as a toy model of crystallization in one dimension . according to the gauss model , regular spacing is the equilibrium position and differentiation moves the function toward equilibrium .",
    "see figure  [ fig : fplots ] for an illustration .",

    "a random trigonometric polynomial of degree @xmath4 is a function of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are random variables . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent real gaussian distributed with mean @xmath8 and variance  @xmath9 , and usually we further assume that the variances @xmath9 are all equal .",
    "our concern is with the properties of the _ real _ zeros of  @xmath10 .",
    "generally @xmath10 will not have all of its zeros real , but the high derivatives of @xmath10 will have mostly real zeros , and those zeros will be close to equally spaced .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : fplots ] .",
    "this is a general property  @xcite of real entire functions of order  @xmath3 , but in the case of trigonometric polynomials this is easy to see .",
    "the @xmath11th derivative of  @xmath10 is @xmath12 where for simplicity we have assumed @xmath11 is a multiple of  @xmath13 , for large @xmath11 the terms @xmath14 dominate .",
    "so the zeros of @xmath15 are close to the zeros of @xmath16 for some real @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and those zeros are real and equally spaced .",
    "another general property of repeated differentiation of real entire functions of order  @xmath3 is that the discrepancy from equal spacing of zeros of the @xmath11th derivative scales as  @xmath19 .",
    "see theorem  2.4.2 of  @xcite . in the case of random trigonometric polynomials",
    "we are able to obtain more precise information .",
    "we describe this in the next section .",
    "in this section @xmath10 is a random trigonometric polynomial of the form   for which the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent gaussian distributed random variables with mean 0 and identical variance .",
    "we wish to measure the rate at which the real zeros of the @xmath11th derivative @xmath15 approach equal spacing as  @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the pair correlation function of the zeros of @xmath15 , defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the dirac @xmath25-function at  @xmath8 , and @xmath26 stands for expected value .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is the density function of real zeros of  @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the density function of differences of real zeros .",
    "since @xmath29 measures the differences between zeros , if the zeros are almost regularly spaced then @xmath30 will be large when @xmath31 is close to a multiple of the average zero spacing and it will be small otherwise .",
    "in other words , we expect that @xmath29 should approach a sum of @xmath25-functions at the integers as @xmath22 .",
    "bogomolny , bohigas , and lebuf  @xcite obtain a general expression for the pair correlation function of the real zeros of a random trigonometric polynomial . from their results ( which we describe in section  [ sec : paircorrelation ] ) we obtain a formula for @xmath29 , which we plot for @xmath32 in figure  [ fig : r01310 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath33 case is from  @xcite .",
    "the plots in figure  [ fig : r01310 ] use the following normalization .",

    "[ sec : rtp ] , as @xmath35 the function @xmath36 has the expected fraction @xmath37 of real zeros .",

    "the precise statement is    [ thm : r2lim ] as @xmath22 , the pair correlation function @xmath30 of the real zeros of @xmath28 approaches a sum of dirac @xmath25-functions at the nonzero integers .",

    "since the zeros of @xmath28 are close to equally spaced , the peak of @xmath30 near @xmath48 is almost completely due to nearest - neighbor spacings .",
    "thus , we can read the nearest - neighbor distribution from the pair - correlation function , as given in  .",
    "in fact , we can also read off the next - nearest neighbor spacing ( and all of the other neighbor spacings ) , as @xmath22 , from the pair correlation function . up to rescaling ,",
    "all of those distributions are the same .",
    "this shows that there are long - term correlations between the zeros , otherwise , for example , the next - nearest neighbor distribution would be the convolution of the nearest neighbor distribution with itself .",
    "one motivation for this work is to understand , in general , the effect of differentiation on the statistics of zeros for functions which have all their zeros on a line . in particular",
    ", we would like to understand the effect of differentiation on the repulsion between zeros .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 has only real zeros and the zeros have the same statistics as the eigenvalues of the classical random matrix @xmath50-ensemble , then the zeros of @xmath49 have repulsion of order @xmath50 . for the derivative  @xmath51 ,",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that the zeros would have repulsion of order  @xmath52 , because pairs of close zeros of @xmath51 occur when @xmath49 has three closely spaced zeros .",
    "this topic is of interest to number theory  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations in this paper do not shed light on this phenomenon because the zeros of random trigonometric polynomials are not in general all on the real line .",
    "we find that all derivatives of a random trigonometric polynomial have _ linear _ repulsion between zeros , and show that this is due to the fact that each derivative moves new zeros onto the real line , and those new zeros show linear repulsion from each other .",
    "see section  [ ssec : linear ] .    in the next section",
    "we discuss generalities about random trigonometric polynomials . in section  [ sec : paircorrelation ] we discuss the asymptotics of the pair correlation of the zeros of @xmath28 , and in section  [ ssec : linear ] we compute the repulsion between the zeros .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is a random trigonometric polynomial of the form  , where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent real normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and identical variance  @xmath53 .",
    "the expected fraction , @xmath39 , of real zeros of @xmath15 is given in  .",
    "this result is due to dunnage  @xcite .",
    "it follows directly from the kac - rice formula , which we give in lemma  [ lem : krf ] .",
    "note that the original polynomial @xmath10 has on average @xmath54 real zeros , the 4th derivative has more than 90% of its zeros real , and one must take 49 derivatives in order to expect 99% real zeros . note that these are asymptotic results , and one can obtain exact formulas for any  @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the @xmath55 , @xmath56 example at the bottom of figure  [ fig : fplots ] expects to have 96.96% real zeros , and this is approximately 1.4% larger than the asymptotic estimate  .",
    "we now derive  .",
    "( the kac - rice formula @xcite)[lem : krf ] suppose @xmath10 is a random trigonometric polynomial with independent real normally distributed coefficients having mean  0 but not necessarily equal variance , and let @xmath57 then the expected number of real roots of @xmath10 in the interval @xmath58 is @xmath59    in the case of @xmath10 of the form   we have @xmath60 if all the coefficients of @xmath10 have equal variance  @xmath53 , then the @xmath11th derivative @xmath15 can be viewed as a random trigonometric polynomial of the form   where the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 have variance  @xmath61 .",
    "so for the @xmath11th derivative we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath35 . from this , formula for the fraction of real roots",
    "@xmath39 follows immediately .",
    "we use a result of bogomolny , bohigas , and lebuf  @xcite to compute the pair correlation function @xmath29 of the real zeros of  @xmath15 .    [",

    "the expected value of the pair correlation function @xmath65 of the _ real _ zeros of @xmath10 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 with @xmath68    we apply the lemma to @xmath15 with @xmath69 .",
    "so we have @xmath70 as @xmath35 . to determine asymptotics for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we use the fact that for continuous functions @xmath74 @xmath75 we change variables @xmath76 , so in the variable @xmath77 the mean spacing between zeros of @xmath78 is unity .",

    "we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 with @xmath86",
    "we first find asymptotic formulas for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",

    "but for @xmath99 we see that @xmath97 is of size  @xmath100 .",
    "thus , as @xmath22 , if @xmath99 then @xmath101 , otherwise @xmath102 .",
    "this is exactly what one should expect because @xmath103 is approaching a sum of @xmath25-functions at the integers .",
    "we now express this more precisely .",
    "the minima of @xmath89 are not exactly at the integers , but they are shifted over to approximately @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "this is also what one would expect because the mean spacing of the _ real _ zeros of @xmath28 is approximately @xmath106 .",
    "we will verify this directly from the above formulas .",
    "differentiating @xmath89 with respect to @xmath31 we have @xmath107 we are thinking of @xmath31 as fixed and @xmath11 large , so the minimum of @xmath89 is close to the solution to @xmath108 which is equivalent to @xmath109 the solutions with @xmath31 near an integer correspond to the minima of  @xmath89 , so writing @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 as expected .    to show the shape of the @xmath25-functions , we expand near the minima of @xmath89 . for positive integers @xmath45 we find that @xmath113 also , @xmath114 thus , @xmath115 , so we obtain theorem  [ thm : r2lim ] .        computing the small @xmath31 asymptotics of   we find that @xmath116 as @xmath22 .",
