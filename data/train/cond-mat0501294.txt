    "recently , there has been renewed interest in quantum hall bars of finite width , where the interplay between localized states in the bulk of the 2-dimensional electron system ( 2des ) and edge states with energies lifted by the confinement potential above the energies of centers of bulk landau bands , @xmath0 , @xcite results in the quantization of the hall conductance .",

    "@xcite in the presence of white noise disorder the edge states do mix with the bulk states when the fermi energy is moved into the center of a landau band . it had been suggested that this might result in localization of edge states .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been shown that at zero temperature the two - terminal conductance of a quantum wire in a magnetic field exhibits for uncorrelated disorder and hard wall confinement discontinuous transitions between integer plateau values and zero .",
    "@xcite these transitions have been argued to be due to sharp localization transitions of chiral edge states , where the localization length of the edge states jumps from _ exponentially large _ to finite values , driven by the dimensional crossover of localized bulk states , and are accordingly called chiral metal insulator transitions ( cmit ) .    in this article , we will study the nature of this transition in more detail , and in particular find that at this transition there exists a new type of state , with properties distinguishable from both localized and extended bulk states , and extended edge states .",
    "this new state is a superposition of edge states with opposite chirality .",
    "since it is still located mainly close to the edges , we will call this state _",
    "nonchiral edge state_.    the article is organised in the following way . in the next section ,",
    "we present transfer matrix calculations of the quantum phase diagram of a quantum hall bar with uncorrelated disorder , being characterised by the two  terminal conductance @xmath1 as function of energy @xmath2 and width @xmath3 of the wire .",
    "sharp jumps in the conductance from integer values to zero are found as function of energy .",
    "these cmit s , are seen to become more pronounced with increasing wire widths @xmath3 .    in the third chapter",
    "we will study with exact diagonalization the eigenstates of a disordered quantum hall wire .",
    "we will classify these states into five classes , the edge states , the 2d localized states , the quasi-1-d localized states , 2d extended states , and the new nonchiral edge states at the chiral metal insulator transition .",
    "these states are characterised by their specific participation ratio as function of energy and wire width @xmath3 , their distribution of coefficients in an expansion in eigenstates of the clean 2des , and the spatial distribution of the eigenfunction amplitudes .",
    "this allows us to identify the state at the transition as a superposition of edge states of opposite chirality .",
    "the final chapter contains our conclusions , and a discussion on how the cmit could be observed experimentally .",

    "close to the middle of the landau bands , however , the conductance plateaus collapse abruptly to @xmath16 .    when the wires are so narrow , that the edge states can not form , as it is the case when the width is smaller than the cyclotron length , or when edge states of opposite chirality are mixed by backscattering , then all the states become localized and the conductance is vanishing with only small mesoscopic fluctuations due to the finite length @xmath17 of the wire .",
    "previously , it has been pointed out that , when the bulk localization length @xmath18 is smaller than the physical wire width @xmath3 , backscattering between edges is exponentially suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the localization length of edge states increases strongly .",
    "the overlap of opposite edge states is known to decrease exponentially with increasing wire width @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the backscattering rate between edges , being proportional to the square of the overlap integral is @xmath19 .",
    "since the edge states are one - dimensional , their localisation length due to the back scattering is given by @xmath20 , with fermi velocity @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , when the bulk localization length @xmath18 becomes equal to the wire width , one expects that the edge states become mixed with the bulk states , and localized with a length proportional to the bulk localization length @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we conjectured the edge localization length to behave like @xcite @xmath22    in fig .",

    "we can conclude that the energy at which edges states backscatter and become localized , is , given by the condition that the bulk localization length is on the order of the wire width , @xmath31 .",
    "at this energy , @xmath15 edge states mix and transitions from extended edge states to insulating states occur .",
    "this causes sharp jumps of @xmath1 from finite integer to vanishingly small values , as seen in fig .",

    "one can gain some further insight by connecting the two ends of the wire together to form an annulus .",
    "piercing magnetic flux through the annulus affects only states whose localization length is larger than the circumference of the annulus .",
    "guiding centers of those states which extend around the annulus do shift in position and energy @xcite with a change in magnetic flux . as shown above , in the middle of the landau band",

    "there it moves up in energy when the magnetic flux is increased further .",
    "@xcite    in the following , we study the states at this transition in detail in order to find out , whether the edge states become localized mainly by mixing completely with the bulk states , or rather the transition from extended chiral edge states to localized states occurs due to the nonlocal coherent superposition of edge states with opposite chirality , located at opposite edges .",

    "all states in a landau level are degenerate . in a disordered wire",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by the disorder , and at the edges by the confinement potential .",

    "however , there is an abrupt shift of the center of the eigenstates towards the middle of the wire , when their energy is approaching the middle of the landau band .",
    "still , one can not conclude , if this fact is mainly due to the backscattering between edge states from opposite edges , having opposite chirality , or if it is mainly due to a mixing with the bulk localized states .    in order to learn more about the nature of these states ,",

    "the participation ratio fluctuates strongly . in this region",
    "we find 2d localized states as well as 1d localized states with a localization length larger than the bulk width , but much smaller than the wire length ( fig [ fig : evstat]b ) . in the latter case , basis states from bulk and edge region mix with comparable contributions .",
    "furthermore , we can identify states which cover the whole sample , as shown in fig [ fig : evstat]c .",
    "these states couple to all regions as well , although the contributions from the left and right edges seem to prevail slightly .",
    "the trend indicated by the maxima close to the edges intensifies in the transition region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evstat]d ) . at a specific energy ,",
    "the contribution of the bulk states is small compared to the sharp maxima at the edges , while the electron is found with the same probability on the right _ or   the left edge of the wire ( fig .",

    "we believe that this nonchiral edge state is unique at least in the thermodynamic limit , of @xmath57 and governs the new type of metal - insulator transition , the cmit , in quasi-1d quantum hall wires .",
    "this state exhibits notable localization features : being an edge state concerning the participation ratio , it has to be considered localized concerning the conductance , since current flows with equal probability , but reversed sign on both edges .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the sudden breakdown of the conductance observed in fig .",
    "[ phasenew ] . _    at higher energies , below the next landau band , edge states are formed as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : evstat - all]b . the higher energy states are clearly edge states , which are decoupled from the bulk , and are altenatingly located either on the left or on the right side of the wire .",

    "still , each state stays located in the edge region , with only a small coupling to the nearest part of the bulk .",
