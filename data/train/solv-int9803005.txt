    "during the last three decades , the study of integrability , invariants , symmetries , and exact solutions of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations ( odes , pdes ) and differential - difference equations ( ddes ) has been the topic of major research projects in the dynamical systems and the soliton communities .",
    "various techniques have been developed to determine whether or not pdes belong to the privileged class of completely integrable equations @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful and widely applied techniques is the painlev test , named after the french mathematician paul painlev ( 1863 - 1933 ) @xcite , who classified second - order differential equations that are globally integrable in terms of elementary functions by quadratures or by linearization .",
    "in essence , the painlev test verifies whether or not solutions of differential equations in the complex plane are single - valued in the neighborhood of all their movable singularities .    to a large extent ,",
    "the painlev test is algorithmic , yet very cumbersome when done by hand .",
    "in particular , the verification of the compatibility conditions is assessed by many practitioners of the painlev test as a painstaking computation .",
    "in addition to the tedious verification of self - consistency ( or compatibility ) conditions , computer programs are helpful at exploring _ all _ possibilities of balancing singular terms .",
    "indeed , the omission of one or more choices of  dominant behavior \" can lead to wrong conclusions @xcite .",
    "we therefore developed the programs _",
    "painsing.max _ and _ painsys.max _ @xcite ( both in _ macsyma _ syntax @xcite ) , and _ painsing.m _ and _ painsys.m _ in _ mathematica _ language @xcite , that perform the painlev test for polynomial systems of odes and pdes . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the above codes by analyzing a few prototypical nonlinear equations and systems , such as the boussinesq and nonlinear schrdinger equations , a class of fifth - order kdv equations , and the hirota - satsuma and lorenz systems .    our computer code does not deal with the theoretical shortcomings of the painlev test as identified by kruskal and others @xcite .",
    "thus far , we have implemented the traditional painlev test @xcite , and not yet incorporated the latest advances in painlev type methods , such as the poly - painlev test @xcite or other generalizations @xcite . neither did we code the weak painlev test @xcite or other variants @xcite . furthermore , we do not have code for the singularity confinement method @xcite , i.e. an adaptation of the painlev test that allows one to test the integrability of difference equations .    among the various alternatives to establish the integrability @xcite of nonlinear pdes and ddes , the search for conserved densities and higher - order symmetries is particularly appealing .",
    "indeed , in this paper we will give algorithms that apply to both the continuous and semi - discrete cases .",
    "we implemented these algorithms @xcite in _ mathematica _ , but they are fairly simple to code in other computer algebra languages ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our algorithms are based on the concept of dilation ( scaling ) invariance .",
    "that inherently limits their scope to polynomial conserved densities and higher - order symmetries of polynomial systems .",
    "although the existence of a sequence of conserved densities predicts integrability , the nonexistence of polynomial conserved quantities does not preclude integrability .",
    "indeed , integrable pdes or ddes could be disguised with a coordinate transformation in ddes that no longer admit conserved densities of polynomial type @xcite .",
    "the same care should be taken in drawing conclusions about non - integrability based on the lack of higher - order symmetries , or equations failing the painlev test .    apart from integrability testing , the knowledge of the explicit form of conserved densities and higher - order symmetries is useful .",
    "for instance , with higher - order symmetries of integrable systems , one can build new completely integrable systems , or discover connections between integrable equations and their group theoretic origin .",
    "explicit forms of conserved densities are useful in the numerical solution of pdes or ddes . in solving ddes , which may arise from integrable discretizations of pdes",
    ", one should check that conserved quantities indeed remain constant .",
    "in particular , the conservation of a positive definite quadratic quantity may prevent nonlinear instabilities in the numerical scheme .    our integrability package _ invariantssymmetries.m _",
    "@xcite in _ mathematica _ automates the tedious computation of closed - form expressions for conserved densities and higher - order symmetries for both pdes and ddes .",
    "applied to systems with parameters , the package determines the conditions on these parameters so that a sequence of conserved densities or symmetries exists .",
    "the software can thus be used to test the integrability of classes of equations that model various wave phenomena .",
    "our examples include a vector modified kdv equation , the extended lotka - volterra and relativitic toda lattices , and the heisenberg spin model .",
    "the conserved densities and symmetries presented in this paper were obtained with _",
    "we focus on pdes . as originally formulated by ablowitz _",
    "@xcite , the painlev conjecture asserts that all similarity reductions of a completely integrable pde should be of painlev - type ; i.e.  its solutions should have no movable singularities other than  poles \" in the complex plane .    a later version of the painlev test due to weiss _",
    "@xcite allows testing of the pde directly , without recourse to the reduction(s ) to an ode .",
    "a pde is said to have the painlev property @xcite if its solutions in the complex plane are single - valued in the neighborhood of all its movable singularities .",
    "in other words , the equation must have a solution without any branching around the singular points whose positions depend on the initial conditions . for odes",
    ", it suffices to show that the general solution has no worse singularities than movable poles , or that no branching occurs around movable essential singularities .",
    "a three step - algorithm , known as the painlev test , allows one to verify whether or not a given nonlinear system of odes or pdes with ( real ) polynomial terms fulfills the necessary conditions for having the painlev property .",
    "such equations are prime candidates for being completely integrable .",
    "there is a vast amount of literature about the test and its applications to specific odes and pdes .",
    "several well - documented surveys @xcite and books @xcite discuss subtleties and pathological cases of the test that are far beyond the scope of this article .",
    "other survey papers @xcite deal with the many interesting by - products of the painlev test .",
    "for example , they show how a truncated laurent series expansion of the type introduced below , allows one to construct lax pairs , bcklund and darboux transformations , and closed - form particular solutions of pdes .",
    "we briefly outline the three steps of the painlev test for a single pde , @xmath0 in two independent variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our software can handle the four independent variables @xmath3 throughout the paper we will use the notations @xmath4 in the approach proposed by weiss , the solution @xmath5 , expressed as a laurent series @xmath6 should be single - valued in the neighborhood of a non - characteristic , movable singular manifold @xmath7 which can be viewed as the surface of the movable poles in the complex plane . in ( [ laurent ] ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a negative integer , and @xmath10 are analytic functions in a neighborhood of @xmath11    note that for odes the singular manifold is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the initial value for @xmath1 . for pdes ,",
    "if @xmath5 has simple zeros and @xmath14 one may apply the implicit function theorem near the singularity manifold and set @xmath15 for an arbitrary function @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this so - called the kruskal simplification , considerably reduces the length of the calculations .",
    "the painlev test proceeds in three steps : * step 1 : determine the dominant behavior * determine the negative integer @xmath9 and @xmath17 from the leading order  ansatz \" .",
    "this is done by balancing the minimal power terms after substitution of @xmath18 into the given pde",
    ". there may be several branches for @xmath19 and for each the next two steps must be performed .",
    "* step 2 : determine the resonances * for a selected @xmath9 and @xmath19 calculate the non - negative integer powers @xmath20 , called the _ resonances _ , at which arbitrary functions @xmath21 enter the expansion .",
    "this is done by requiring that @xmath21 is arbitrary after substitution of @xmath22 into the equation , only retaining its most singular terms .",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 will be arbitrary if its coefficient equals zero .",
    "the integer roots of the resulting polynomial must be computed .",
    "the number of roots , including @xmath23 should match the order of the given pde .",
    "the root @xmath24 corresponds to the arbitrariness of the manifold @xmath25 , * step 3 : verify the correct number of free coefficients * verify that the correct number of arbitrary functions @xmath21 indeed exists by substituting the truncated expansion @xmath26 into the pde , where @xmath27 is the largest resonance . at non - resonance levels , determine all @xmath28 at resonance levels , @xmath21 should be arbitrary , and since we are dealing with a nonlinear equation , a _ compatibility condition _ must be verified .    an equation for which the above steps can be carried out consistently and unambiguously ,",
    "is said to have the painlev property and is conjectured to be completely integrable .",
    "this entails that the solution has the necessary number of free coefficients @xmath29 and that the compatibility condition at each of these resonances is unconditionally satisfied .",
    "the reader should be warned that the above algorithm does not detect essential singularities and therefore can not determine whether or not branching occurs about these .",
    "so , for an equation to be integrable it is _ not _ _ sufficient _ that it passes the painlev test .",
    "neither it is _",
    "necessary_. indeed , there are integrable equations , such as the dym - kruskal equation , @xmath30 that do not pass the painlev test , yet , by a complicated change of variables can be transformed into an integrable equation .",
    "the generalization of the algorithm to systems of odes and pdes is obvious .",
    "yet , it is non - trivial to implement .",
    "one of the reasons is that the major symbolic packages do not handle inequalities well .",
    "with respect to systems , our code is based on the above three step - algorithm but generalized to systems , as it can be found in @xcite . in these papers",
    "there is an abundance of worked examples that served as test cases .",
    "for example , given a system of first - order odes , @xmath31 one introduces a laurent series for every dependent variable @xmath32 @xmath33 the computer program must carefully determine all branches of dominant behavior corresponding to various choices of @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 for each branch , the single - valuedness of the corresponding laurent expansion must be tested ( i.e. the resonances must be computed and the compatibility conditions must be verified ) .",
    "all the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "singularity analysis for pdes is nontrivial @xcite and the painlev test should be applied with extreme care .",
    "notwithstanding , our software automatically performs the _ formal _ steps of the painlev test for systems of odes and pdes .",
    "the examples in section 3.2 illustrate how the code works .",
    "careful analysis of the output and drawing conclusions about integrability should be done by humans .",
    "some subtleties of the mathematics of the painlev test of systems of pdes were also dealt with in @xcite .",
    "numerous examples of the painlev test for odes can be found in the review papers .",
    "we turn our attention to pdes . using our software package _ painsing.max _ or _",
    "painsing.m _ one can determine the conditions under which the equation @xmath36 passes the painlev test .    for ( [ cylindricalkdv ] ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 apart from @xmath23 the roots are @xmath39 and @xmath40 the latter three are resonances .",
    "furthermore , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are indeed arbitrary since the compatibility conditions at resonances @xmath44 and @xmath45 are satisfied identically .",
    "the compatibility condition at resonance @xmath46 is @xmath47 ignoring the trivial solution , we get @xmath48 without loss of generality , we set @xmath49 and equation ( [ cylindricalkdv ] ) becomes the _ cylindrical _ kdv equation which is indeed completely integrable @xcite . painlev based investigations for integrable pdes with space and time dependent coefficients are given in @xcite .",
    "our painlev programs can not automatically test a class of equations such as @xmath50 with arbitrary ( non - zero and real ) parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 the parameters affect the lowest coefficient in the laurent expansion in such as way that the roots @xmath53 can not be computed , and the integrability conditions can no longer be tested .",
    "in ( [ classfifthkdv ] ) there are four cases that are of particular interest :    * \\(i ) @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( lax equation ) , * \\(ii ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( sawada - kotera equation ) , * \\(iii ) @xmath56 and @xmath58 ( kaup - kupershmidt equation ) , and * \\(iv ) @xmath59 and @xmath55 ( ito equation ) .    in table 1",
    "we list the results of the painlev test applied to these cases . for the first three equations the compatibility conditions are satisfied at all the resonances .",
    "these equations pass the test . for the ito equation",
    "the compatibility conditions are only satisfied at some of the resonances .",
    "the ito equation fails the test .",
    "the first three equations are known to be completely integrable .",
    "ito s equation is not completely integrable .",
    "the two other algorithms presented in this paper can determine the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) that assure the complete integrability of ( [ classfifthkdv ] ) .",
    "the conserved densities and higher - order symmetries of ( [ classfifthkdv ] ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "0.01pt    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     table 4 : @xmath60 conserved densities for the heisenberg spin model    0.01pt furthermore , the sum of two conserved densities is a conserved density .",
    "hence , after adding ( [ ssquare ] ) , @xmath61 can be replaced by @xmath62 note that @xmath63 and recall that densities are equivalent if they only differ by a total @xmath64derivative .",
    "so , ( [ contspinhamiltonian2 ] ) is equivalent with @xmath65 which can be compactly written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 consequently , the hamiltonian of ( [ orgheisenberg ] ) @xmath68 is constant in time .",
    "the dot @xmath69 refers to the standard inner product of vectors .",
    "itoh @xcite studied this extended version of the lotka - volterra equation ( [ volterra ] ) : @xmath70 for @xmath71 ( [ extvolterra ] ) is ( [ volterra ] ) , for which three conserved densities and one symmetry are listed in table 3 . in @xcite , we gave two additional densities and in @xcite we listed two more symmetries .",
