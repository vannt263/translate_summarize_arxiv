    "an ensemble of non - spherical particles , interacting via hard core interactions , exhibits a first order isotropic - nematic phase transition as the number density increases , followed by a nematic - solid transition @xcite . in his celebrated theoretical work @xcite ,",

    "it does not give a reasonable equation of state ; the pressure remains finite at arbitrarily high number density .    in this paper ,",
    "the density functional theory of aspherical hard particles is revisited .",
    "we are particularly interested in the phase behavior of hard ellipsoids at high densities , and near densest packing limit .",
    "our model is essential and approximate ; the evaluation of the partition function at high densities , even for hard spheres , has eluded researchers to date in spite of considerable effort . nonetheless , we feel it may reasonably capture a salient aspect of the problem : the depletion of available phase space as the density is increased .",
    "our key result is the striking fact that at densities above the isotropic - nematic transition , the orientational distribution function which minimizes the free energy has a compact support over orientation space .",
    "we also find that the nematic phase is more orientationally ordered than in onsager theory at the same density .",
    "more importantly , but not surprisingly , our simple model gives a reasonable equation of state ; that is , the pressure diverges at the dense packing limit .",
    "the goal of the paper is to provide an approximate but realistic description of dense orientationally ordered hard particle systems ; currently available descriptions are either low density approximations @xcite , or they rely on somewhat _ ad hoc _ carnahan - starling type corrections to the free energy at high densities @xcite .",

    "the configurational helmholtz free energy of a system of @xmath6 particles , within an additive constant , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the generalized ( orientational and positional ) coordinate of the @xmath9 particle , and @xmath10 is the repulsive interaction energy between particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the sum is over all pairs of particles .",

    "the equilibrium orientational distribution @xmath0 is a function of @xmath5 , and is not known _ a priori_. intuitively , one would expect particles to align more and more as the number density is increased , indicating a decrease of the orientationally averaged excluded volume with number density .",
    "it follows that the densest packing density can not be greater than the inverse of the smallest average excluded volume of a pair of particles .",
    "the orientational distribution function is therefore expected to depend sensitively on the number density @xmath5 .    to capture accurately the phase behavior ,",

    "we suspect the existence of biaxial equilibrium solutions , especially for @xmath143 , since the energy graph for each @xmath144 corresponds to two separated branches , with inadmissible regions in between , and energy diverges as @xmath97 gets close to the boundary of the inadmissible region as seen in fig .",

    "we select two representative values of @xmath71 to examine the landscape of the free energy density vs.  @xmath63 . for each value of @xmath71 , we specify @xmath63 , and",
    "numerically solve for @xmath83 using an iterative newton s method , and then numerically evaluate the energy density . in fig .",
    "[ fig - biaxial ] , energy density contours are plotted vs.different @xmath63 . for @xmath166 , there are six critical points on the energy surface : one isotropic local minimizer , one prolate uniaxial global minimizer , one uniaxial oblate local maximizer along the hypotenuse , one uniaxial oblate local minimizer , one uniaxial oblate saddle point along the short vertical edge , and one biaxial saddle point in the interior of the triangle . for @xmath167 , there are three critical points : one uniaxial prolate local minimizer along the hypotenuse , one uniaxial oblate local minimizer along the short vertical edge , and one biaxial saddle point in the interior of the triangle . the energy blows up when @xmath168 , so there is an inadmissible region in the upper left portion of the triangle .",
    "thus it suggests that for any value of @xmath71 large enough , if @xmath124 is one of the equilibrium uniaixal solution , there will be a saddle point biaxial equilibrium solution .",
    "this was also not reported in onsager s work , nor , as far as we know , in any model for uniaxial particles without an external field .",
    "in this paper , we study a system of ellipsoidal particles interacting only via hard core interactions .",
    "we consider the canonical ensemble , and derive an expression for the free energy density .",
    "the free energy density contains a logarithmic term , which , upon expansion , is in agreement with onsager s model .",
    "we argue that onsager s model predicts the correct phase behavior near the nematic - isotropic transition , but it fails to give the correct equation of state ; the pressure does not diverge as the number density is increased without limit .",
    "thus , onsager s model can not be used to accurately describe dense nematics .",
    "our work , essential and approximate as it may be , provides a starting point toward studying dense nematic systems .",
    "the derivation of the free energy is in the mean field spirit , and the results predicted from the model might not agree quantitatively with experiment , but we hope it will show at least qualitative agreement .    with the uniaxial assumption , we were able to simplify the self - consistent equations and to demonstrate a bifurcation landscape which is much richer than that of onsager .",
    "a striking result is that almost all equilibrium probability density functions have a forbidden region in orientation space . as the number density increases ,",
    "the regions of forbidden orientations grow , and the degree of orientational order increases .",
    "our model predicts a first order nematic - isotropic phase transition , and complete alignment in a dense packing limit .",
