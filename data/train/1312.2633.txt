    "the dramatic enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in fese from 8 k in bulk@xcite to nearly 70 k when grown as a single layer on sto has generated tremendous interest as it raises the question of how cooper pairing can be strengthened in non - bulk systems .",
    "we begin by studying the electronic structure of the 1 uc fese / sto film .",
    "growth details are discussed in the supplementary information ( si ) and extended data ( ed ) fig .",
    "the electronic structure is plotted in fig .",
    "1a - f and is consistent with previous reports@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface of the 1uc film consists of electron - like ( concave up , labeled * a * ) pockets centered around the brillouin zone corner ( m - point ) with a band bottom 60 mev below the fermi energy ( e@xmath1 ) .",
    "further analysis reveals there are in fact two nearly - degenerate electron bands at m ( see si ) . below the bottom of",
    "* a * , one hole - like ( concave down , labeled * b * ) band is clearly resolved .",
    "the zone center ( @xmath2 ) consists of another hole - like band ( labeled * d * ) with a top located 80 mev below e@xmath3 .",
    "the temperature evolution of the band structure is shown in fig .",
    "2a - f and shows typical superconducting gap behavior , with the electron band backbending at the fermi momentum ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "symmetrized energy distribution curves ( edcs ) shown in fig . 2c",
    "are fit using a phenomenological model ( ref .",
    "[ ] ) to reveal a 13 mev gap plotted in fig .",
    "2d . utilizing a mean - field ( mf ) formula we obtain t@xmath5 = 58@xmath67 k ,",
    "consistent with previous results within experimental uncertainty@xcite .",
    "analyzing the energy gap at different points ( fig .",
    "2e - f ) we observe a round , un - nested fermi surface with a nearly uniform gap , making it unlikely that the gap is caused by other instabilities such as charge density waves .",
    "we now turn to the most unexpected aspect of our 1uc data : the clearly resolved replica bands labeled * a@xmath7 * , * b@xmath7 * in fig . 1d-1f . aside from an approximately 100 mev relative shift in energy , all features of * a * are replicated in * a@xmath7*. this includes the back - bending near @xmath8 , seen in fig .",
    "3 . similarly",
    "* b * and * b@xmath7 * are also separated by the same energy shift with nearly the same dispersion . in fig .",
    "1d we mark the peaks associated with * a * , * a@xmath7 * and * b * , * b@xmath7 * by blue and red , respectively , illustrating the clear presence of these features even in the raw edc data . in the si we rule out",
    "the possibility that such replicas can be caused by band structure effects , e.g. quantum well states@xcite , and further discuss weaker features such as * c * and * d@xmath7*.    we believe the replica bands are due to the shaking off of quanta of the bosonic modes in sto , reminiscent of the vibron shake offs in the photoemission spectra of h@xmath9 molecules@xcite . in the si",
    "we make the case that such bosonic modes are associated with a high energy sto oxygen phonon band@xcite near 100 mev , although its exact energy may be modified somewhat by the presence of the overlaying film .",
    "this identification is supported by recent arpes on sto surface states which show a phonon - induced hump at approximately 100 mev away from the main band@xcite and through inelastic neutron scattering@xcite . resolving replicas of an entire band with such a clear dispersion , as seen in fig .",
    "1d , is unprecedented in a solid .",
    "this becomes possible here by the substantial electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling , the fact that the collective mode energy is greater than the width of the electron band below e@xmath3 , and most importantly , the fact that the electron - phonon coupling only allows small momentum transfer to the electron ( see later discussion and si ) .",
    "we now turn to the multi - uc films .",
    "we have measured 2uc and 30uc thick fese films grown on similar nb - doped sto substrates . in fig .",
    "3a - f we compare the second energy derivative of the apres spectra for the 1uc ( a , d ) , 2uc ( b , e ) and 30uc ( c , f ) films .",
    "we find that the 2uc and 30uc band structure consists of both electron - like and hole - like bands crossing e@xmath3 near m , similar to what has been observed for bulk fese@xcite .",
    "this is dramatically different from the 1uc film s band structure , where only electron bands cross e@xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the 1uc film is much more heavily electron doped than even the 2uc film@xcite .",
    "most importantly we observe neither a superconducting - like energy gap nor replica bands in the multi - uc films .",
    "a complete comparison of the band structures can be found in ed fig .",
    "2 . the fact that we find only the 1uc film has the superconducting gap is consistent with the conclusion of ref .",
    "[ ] , where despite transport data showing multi - uc films to be superconducting , it is argued that only the 1uc portion of the film actually superconducts .    the temperature evolution of the replica bands in the 1uc film is plotted in fig .",
    "3g - j ( additional temperatures are plotted in ed fig .",
    "we see that these replica bands , and hence this anomalous electron - phonon coupling , persists to temperatures significantly above the gap - opening temperature .",
    "the contrast between the 1uc and multiple - uc films suggests that the sto phonon which causes the replica bands is also responsible for enhancing cooper pairing@xcite .",
    "the fact that the replica bands in the 1uc film follows the dispersion of the main band so closely suggests that , upon either absorption or emission , the phonons can only transmit small momenta to the electron .",
    "such a strong forwardly - focused e - ph interaction is unusual , as it can enhance cooper pairing in most symmetry channels , including those with a sign change ( see si and ed fig . 6)@xcite .    to estimate the strength of the e - ph coupling",
    ", we perform a high statistics scan at m at low temperature , plotted in fig .",
    "4a . using a spline background , we find a lower bound of 1/6 for the intensity ratio of the replica band to the main band ( see fig .",
    "4b and ed fig .",
    "we then take the intensity ratio as input and theoretically estimate the e - ph coupling strength ( see si ) .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "4c is a simulated spectral function calculated using a model where both the electron and hole bands couple to a flat phonon band with energy 80 mev . by tuning the coupling strength and the forward - focusing parameter",
    "we can well - reproduce a band - replica separation of approximately 100 mev .",
    "the simulated edc is plotted in fig .",
    "the arpes spectrum is well - reproduced , especially the abrupt loss in spectral weight of band * a@xmath10 * beyond a certain momentum window , and the momentum broadening of the bands , plotted in ed fig .",
    "5 .    from the intensity ratios we obtain the e - ph coupling constant @xmath11 , which is substantial considering only a narrow range of phonon modes at such high frequency contribute to the coupling ( due to nearly forward scattering ) .",
    "this estimate in turn yields an effective phonon - mediated attraction strength @xmath12 10 mev ( see si ) . under the assumption that cooper pairing is caused by the magnetic interaction in the absence of the e - ph interaction , and following the effective hamiltonian approach described in ref .",
    "[ ] , we first determine the pairing symmetry without the e - ph interaction as a function of the ratio between the nearest and second neighbor magnetic exchange constant @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the band structure we use is plotted in ed fig .",
    "it is noted that for the physically relevant @xmath14/@xmath13 ratio ( > 0.5 ) the pairing is in - phase @xmath15-wave between the two electron pockets @xcite , see ed fig .",
    "we then determine the enhancement of the cooper pairing temperature as a function of the ratio between @xmath16 and the antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath17 ( see si ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath18 mev from the largest nearest- and second - neighbor exchange constants determined from neutron scattering experiments known to us@xcite , thus overestimating the magnetic coupling .",
    "plots the t@xmath5 enhancement as a function of @xmath19 for varying ratios of _ _ j__@xmath9 to _",
    "_ j__@xmath20 . using",
    "the @xmath16 extracted from our data and the above estimate of j , we determine the enhancement factor to be @xmath21 1.5 .",
    "this enhancement is a lower bound as we use the most conservative estimate of the e - ph coupling , and the largest @xmath22 value .",
    "for bulk materials with similar band structures , e.g. k@xmath23fe@xmath24se@xmath9@xcite , or materials from which we obtain the above stated @xmath22 value@xcite , the t@xmath5 s range from 30 - 40 k. multiplying by the enhancement factor yields a gap - opening temperature in fairly good agreement with our films .",
    "it should be noted that we do not use the t@xmath5 of bulk fese due to the fact that our films are heavily electron doped and hence have a very different band structure from that of bulk fese .    motivated by the physical picture presented here , we propose a heterostructure where 1uc fese is sandwiched between sto on both sides , effectively doubling @xmath16 . a simple reading of fig .",
    "4d suggests a t@xmath5 enhancement of @xmath252.5 , placing the cooper pairing temperature well above the liquid nitrogen temperature .",
