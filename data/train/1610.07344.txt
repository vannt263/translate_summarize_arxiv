    ", two regimes can be identified . at short times",
    "@xmath156 , the msd increases in a superdiffusive manner as @xmath157 mainly due to the inertia of the cell , i.e. , activity little affects the dynamic in this time regime .",
    "thereby , there is little variation between the various gap widths .",
    "when the cell displacement , the square root of the msd , reaches approximately a cell diameter at @xmath158 , the msd assumes a plateau - like value .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the _ wobbling _ motion of the cell body . while for the very narrow gap",
    ", wobbling is suppressed by steric interactions with the surfaces , it is well pronounced for wider gaps .",
    "the wobbling motion is illustrated in the simulation animations s1 and s2 of the esi .    at times",
    "longer than about @xmath159 , another superdiffusive regime is assumed .",
    "in particular , the cells confined in the narrowest gap exhibit a ballistic motion . this is related to rather straight trajectories of the individual cells ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : cell_migration ] ) . for the wider gaps ,",
    "the msd increases somewhat slower , but it is close to ballistic motion . the smaller exponent points toward a modified migration behavior of the cells , possibly by curved trajectories or other types of migration behavior . in general , however , there are seemingly only minor qualitative differences between the various slit widths over the considered range of displacements on the order of @xmath160 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath161 , we expect that the cells exhibit a diffusive motion .",
    "however , to reach this regime requires much longer simulations .",
    "in order to characterize the orientational stability of trajectories , we determine the body orientational correlation function @xmath162 with @xmath163 the unit vector along the major body axis .",
    "results for the narrow gap @xmath78 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation_corr](a ) . in general , the orientations are rather persistent and only some realizations exhibit a moderate decay of @xmath164 . the various realizations exhibit fast oscillations , which correspond to the frequencies presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : body_rotation_frequency ] .",
    "moreover , certain slower oscillations are superimposed , indicating a rich overall dynamics of a cell due to the angle between the body and the bundle .",
    "correlation functions averaged over the various realization are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation_corr](b ) . in the narrower gaps with @xmath78 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the cells swim in a rather straight manner and the correlation functions decay slowly .",
    "this is illustrated in the snapshots of fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_migration ] .",
    "for slit widths @xmath165 , @xmath164 decays rather similarly for the considered cases .",
    "thereby , the correlation function decays significantly faster compared to narrower gaps .",
    "this is related to the single - wall behavior of the cells for the wider slits . here",
    ", the dynamical pattern is quite heterogeneous .",
    "some of the cells start to move along circles , similar to planktonic cells , @xcite where we are only able to see part of the circular path during the considered simulation time .",
    "other cells rather roll over the surface as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_migration ] .",
    "this is partially caused by the , in case of our simulations , lower migration speed of swarmer cells compared with planktonic cells .",
    "more importantly , the flow profile of swarmer cells is more complex in comparison with that of swimming bacteria , @xcite since the body is in part covered with flagella bundle(s ) .",
    "the interplay between the rotating bundle ( behind the cell body ) and the counterrotating flagella - covered cell body can lead to cell - rolling in a curved manner ( cf .",
    "[ fig : cell_migration ] ) .",
    "hence , in combination with wobbling , we observe a distinctively different surface behavior of the considered swarmer cells due to the rotating flagella bundle and the counterrotating cell body .",
    "rolling over a surfaces has been observed experimentally for artificial bacteria flagella.@xcite    in general , the correlation functions decay in an non - exponential manner .",
    "this is certainly not surprising , since the rotational diffusion coefficient is low and we did not cover the time scale corresponding to the inverse of this diffusion coefficient .",
    "nevertheless , the results of fig .  [ fig : orientation_corr](b ) reveal a qualitative difference in the migration behavior in rather narrow or wider gaps .",
    "we have proposed a model for an _",
    "e. coli_-type swarmer cell and have investigated its properties in confinement between two parallel walls . in general , we find a significant heterogeneity in the appearing structures and the dynamics . for very narrow gaps , where @xmath166 , confinement strongly affects the bundle arrangement and the dynamical properties of cells such as the cell rotation frequency and the migration velocity . for gap widths @xmath167 , @xmath57 independent values are assumed .",
    "the distribution of cells sensitively depends on the wall separation . in very narrow gaps ( @xmath168 ) ,",
    "the bundle arrangement matters and geometrical restrictions are essential . with increasing wall separation ( @xmath169 ) , both walls become equally important and the cells migrate in the center between the walls , whereas for large @xmath170 cells stay close to one of the walls over the simulation time . considering the migration patters , we find straight paths for narrow gaps , but also rolling over a surface of cells for wide gaps .",
    "this is reflected in the cells center - of - mass mean square displacement .",
    "our calculations show a decrease of the cell migration velocity with increasing body length .",
    "this result is in agreement with theoretical expectations within the resistive force theory.@xcite however , ref .",
    "states that elongated _ e. coli _ planktonic cells migrate as fast as planktonic _",
    "e. coli _ cells and that _",
    "e.coli _ swarmer cells migrate even @xmath171 faster .",
    "this clearly contradicts our simulation results and theoretical expectations .",
    "it remains to be clarified , why swarmer cells migrate so efficiently .",
    "hypothetically , an increased torque in the elongated cells would give rise to faster migration .",
    "interestingly , essentially a single bundle is formed including in average approximately @xmath172 of the flagella , which gives rise to a migration behavior rather similar to swimming planktonic cells .",
    "this is related to the length ratio between the cell body and the flagella ; in our case the ratio is approximately unity .",
    "such cells exhibit collective swarming behavior as seen in various experiments.@xcite however , significantly longer swarmer cells , longer than the length of a flagellum , form multiple bundles and are expected to show a distinctively different swarming behavior .",
    "specifically , inter - cell bundles might be formed as suggested in refs .  .",
    "we are currently working on an extension of our studies to such longer cells .",
    "finally , we would like to stress once more the importance of hydrodynamic interactions for bundle formation.@xcite tests confirm that bundles are also occasionally formed without hydrodynamic interactions@xcite due to flagella rotation and the associated counter - rotation of the cell body , but that strongly depends on the initial arrangement of flagella .",
    "however , in presence of hydrodynamic interactions , bundles are always formed .",
