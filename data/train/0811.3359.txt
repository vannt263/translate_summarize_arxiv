    "presently , modern surgery has at its disposal a great variety of different surgical techniques to heat biological tissue in a localized and safe way .",
    "all these techniques are based on specific applicators , _",
    "i.e. _ devices which extract ( cryosurgery ) or introduce heat ( laser , radiofrequency current , microwave or ultrasound treatments ) .",
    "theoretical heat modeling is a very cheap and fast methodology to study the thermal performance of these applicators .",
    "in fact , a lot of previous work has been conducted to model these procedures by using the bioheat equation as governing equation ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this equation is based on the classical fourier theory of heat conduction and is widely used for modeling the heating of biological tissue .",
    "nevertheless , it has been hypothesized that for heat transfers on very small time scales the classical model will fail , and an alternative thermal wave theory with a finite thermal propagation speed could be more suitable to describe these phenomena .    for the aforementioned reasons",
    ", we are lead to modeling the surgical heating of biological tissue by means of the hyperbolic heat transfer equation , and then compare these alternative results with those obtained from the standard fourier theory ( implying the parabolic heat transfer equation ) .    in summary ,",
    "the main theme of this work is to present in depth the mathematical and physical background for a general discussion of heat models related to heating of biological tissue by means of energy applicators , and then , in particular , point out the physical differences between the classical fourier theory and the hyperbolic wave theory .",
    "moreover , as an illustrative example , we give some numerical results of the analytical modeling for radiofrequency heating ( _ rfh _ ) and for laser heating , each applied to the cornea in order to correct refractive errors .",
    "both surgical techniques have in common that they may involve high heat transfers during very short exposure times .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ heatmodels ] we will set up the mathematical groundwork for heat models related to _",
    "rfh _ and laser heating with a special emphasis on parabolic and hyperbolic heat models .",
    "then , in sec .  [ applications ] we present the results for typical laser and _ rfh _ interventions in order to substantiate the physical discrepancies between both heat models in concrete examples .",
    "we will also comment on the domain of applicability of both theories and their main features .",

    "the most fundamental relation to model heat transfer is the generally valid , _",
    "i.e. _ model - independent , equation for thermal current conservation with a given internal heat source @xmath0 : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 denotes the thermal flux and @xmath3 is the temperature at point @xmath4 in the domain @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . as usual ,",
    "thermal conductivity is denoted by @xmath7 and diffusivity by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the volumetric heat capacity , being @xmath10 the density and @xmath11 the specific heat of the material under consideration . fig .",
    "[ currentpic ] gives a schematic view of thermal current conservation .",
    "fourier s law of heat conduction @xcite constitutes the foundation of all classical heat models .",
    "it proposes that the heat flux @xmath2 is proportional to the negative of the temperature gradient ( see fig .",
    "[ fourierpic ] ) : @xmath12 however , in this relation temporal changes instantaneously affect heat flux and temperature gradient . as an immediate consequence",
    "any perturbations in classical heat models are propagated with infinite speed .    assuming that thermal current conservation ( [ current ] ) and fourier s law ( [ fourier ] ) hold , directly yields the classical , _",
    "i.e. _ parabolic heat transfer equation ( _ phte _ ) with heat sources : @xmath13 the standard bioheat equation was introduced by pennes @xcite and is based on the parabolic heat transfer model , identifying the following explicit contributions for the heat sources in a biological system @xmath14 where the subindex @xmath15 denotes a surgical heat source ( _ e.g. _ laser or radiofrequency treatment ) , @xmath16 refers to blood perfusion , and @xmath17 to any source related to metabolic activity .    with the advancement of modern surgery ,",
    "medical treatments involve progressively smaller time scales and higher energy fluxes .",
    "for example , for radiofrequency and laser surgery _",
    "phte _ models could become inappropriate .",
    "the reason is that on small time scales @xmath18 $ ] , with a sufficiently small value for @xmath19 , thermal equilibrium of an extended physical system simply can not be reached .",
    "this contradicts the classical model , where all elements of the thermodynamic system interact with no delay through infinite thermal speed .",
    "it is to be expected that such theories implying infinite speed of perturbations in the heated medium and more realistic wave theories with finite speeds differ considerably in their predictions .",
    "a modified version of fourier s law ( [ fourier ] ) uses a non - vanishing relaxation time @xmath20 in the dissipative process .",
    "this parameter may be interpreted as the finite time necessary for the dissipative flow to relax to its steady thermodynamic value .",
    "the simplest generalization for finite speeds leads to cattaneo - vernotte s equation @xcite : @xmath21 note that the classical fourier law is still included as a special limiting case , taking the limit of zero relaxation time for the heat fluxes . in general",
    ", however , there is an inertial or retardation term which delays any changes in the temperature gradient to be transferred to the heat flux .",
    "this can also be seen for small relaxation intervals @xmath20 , which yields the expression @xmath22 although it appears at first sight that eq .",
    "( [ cv ] ) is an expansion which only holds approximately for small relaxation intervals @xmath20 , by considering entropy arguments ziik and tzou have shown that eq .",
    "( [ cv ] ) is also valid on a macroscopic scale  @xcite .    by combining the heat transfer model ( [ cv ] ) with current conservation ( [ current ] ) , one directly obtains the hyperbolic heat transfer equation ( _ hhte _ ) with heat sources : @xmath23 for zero relaxation the hyperbolic heat equation obviously reduces to the classical model . an essential feature of eq .",
    "( [ hhte ] ) is the second - order time derivative with coefficient @xmath19 , which gives rise to wave properties of the equation , and therefore implies finite thermal propagation speeds .",
    "this can easily be seen by considering forwardly propagating waves which provide solutions for eq .",
    "( [ hhte ] ) of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the usual wave propagation vector and @xmath26 the corresponding frequency .",
    "this approach is somehow analogous to the analysis of the _ telegraph equation _ , which describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in conducting media  @xcite .",
    "note that in the present case , however , a term proportional to @xmath27 is absent on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hhte ] ) .    by following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite and substituting eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ hhte ] ) for sourceless heat transfer , then requiring that the real - numbered factor multiplying with @xmath28 has to be zero , one directly obtains for the thermal propagation speed @xmath29 from this it becomes evident that for vanishing relaxation times @xmath20 and constant diffusivity @xmath30 , the propagation speed tends to infinity . as indicated before , but seen from a different perspective , in this limiting case the hyperbolic model reduces again to the standard fourier theory .",
    "one further distinctive feature of the _ hhte _ model is observed by representing the hyperbolic heat flux equation ( [ cv ] ) in integral form  @xcite @xmath31 note that eq .",
    "( [ hypflux ] ) shows that @xmath32 depends on the full history of the temperature gradient within the time interval @xmath33 $ ] , something which is entirely absent in the much simpler expression for the fourier flux in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) .    exhibiting these features ,",
    "the hyperbolic heat transfer model with its finite thermal propagation appears to provide an ideal framework to describe surgical interventions such as laser ablation ( a procedure named as laser thermokeratoplasty , or short _ ltk _ ) and _ rfh _ of the cornea ( _ ck _ , conductive keratoplasty ) , which use very short and high - energetic pulsations ( typical time periods are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , in the following section , we will focus on applications of heat models in surgical techniques , in particular _",
    "rfh _ and laser surgery applied to the cornea , and thereby develop a realistic model for the heating of biological tissue by employing the _ hhte _ as previously derived in eq .",
    "( [ hhte ] ) .",
    "there exist numerous processes in which great amounts of heat are applied to materials in very short exposure times .",
    "this section will focus on the modeling of heating biological tissue as it occurs during medical intervention with surgical radiofrequency or laser devices to the cornea .",
    "laser heating is a process which implies tissue heating caused by absorbing the optical energy of a high - energy laser beam ( _ ltk _ ) . on the other hand , radiofrequency heating ( _ rfh _ )",
    "is ultimately based on ohm s law , which states that currents flowing through a resistor generate heat .",
    "it is essentially ionic motion in the tissue which will provoke biological heating aimed at producing any medical effects .",
    "both are surgical techniques which may not only involve small time scales but also high energy fluxes , which makes them an important group of applications in which differences between parabolic and hyperbolic models could have great effects .    as we have previously mentioned in sec .",
    "[ heatmodels ] , these type of processes represent non - equilibrium processes on small time scales ( _ i.e. _ compared to the relaxation time @xmath20 ) , since the system requires considerably more time to reach the equilibrium state after the initial thermal energy input . for this reason , _ phte _ models , with their infinite thermal propagation speed , may not provide an appropriate description for the underlying physical structure , and it may be necessary to rely on _ hhte _ models instead .      among the many surgical procedures in which laser heating is employed , we focus our attention on corneal laser heating , also referred to as laser thermokeratoplasty ( _ ltk _ )",
