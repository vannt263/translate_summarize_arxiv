    "until very recently , studies of @xmath1@xmath51 galaxies have focused primarily on luminous , vigorously star - forming objects such as submillimetre sources or @xmath6@xmath2@xmath0 lbgs that are forming stars at rates of 10s or 100s @xmath4/yr .",
    "such studies have largely neglected the less glamorous but far more numerous faint , sub-@xmath0 galaxies that are forming stars at much lower rates .",
    "although individually faint , these sub-@xmath0 objects are very numerous and so collectively they generate more than half the total uv luminosity density of the universe at high redshift .",
    "they are , thus , extremely important contributors to the story of star formation and metal enrichment in the early universe .",
    "moreover , the presence of a break at @xmath0 in the galaxy lf suggests that galaxies below @xmath0 differ substantially from those above it . because of this , our understanding of the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution at high redshift may profit from comparing the properties of the better - studied luminous ( @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath0 ) objects with those of the neglected sub-@xmath0 galaxies . this paper summarizes the results of our recent work aimed at understanding these hitherto neglected , individually modest but collectively very important objects .",
    "they are the long faint tail of the high-@xmath1 galaxy population .",
    "the shape of the galaxy lf bears the imprint of galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "we study the global statistics of sub-@xmath8 galaxies at @xmath1@xmath22 , 3 , 4 , and 5 using two deep , large - area , multi - field imaging surveys .    at @xmath1@xmath22 , 3 , and 4 we use the keck deep fields ( kdf ) of sawicki & thompson ( 2005 , 2006a , b ) .",
    "the kdf use the _ very same _",
    "@xmath9 filter set and color - color selection criteria as are used in the well - known work of @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the steidel et al .",
    "work , the kdf reach @xmath10=27 , which is 1.5 mag deeper than the steidel et al.surveys and significantly below @xmath8 ; even at @xmath1@xmath24 we reach 2 mag fainter than @xmath11 .",
    "the kdf have an area of 169 arcmin@xmath12 divided into three spatially independent regions on the sky that allow us to monitor the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "the @xmath13 filters and color - color selection commonality with the work of steidel et al .",
    "lets us confidently select very faint , sub-@xmath8 galaxies at @xmath1@xmath22 , 3 , and 4 by relying on their extensive spectroscopic characterization of sample selection .",
    "it also allows us to confidently combine our data with theirs , thereby for the first time consistently spanning such a large range in galaxy luminosity at high redshift .",
    "our @xmath1@xmath25 work is based on very deep @xmath14 imaging of two subaru suprime - cam fields presented in @xcite .",
    "these data are wider and deeper than earlier work we presented in @xcite : they now span a total of 1,300 arcmin@xmath12 divided over two fields with @xmath15 = 26.5 and 25.5 .",
    "the large area covered by these data is essential for determining the abundance of the rare , luminous objects , while at the same time the depth of the data gives us the necessary ability to probe below @xmath0 in the lf .",
    "we use @xmath14 lyman break selection to select @xmath1@xmath25 galaxies and our ongoing spectroscopic program has already confirmed a number of @xmath1@xmath25 galaxies , validating our @xmath1@xmath25 color - color selection technique @xcite .",
    "we find that the luminosity function of high-@xmath1 galaxies undergoes evolution that is differential with luminosity . as fig .",
    "1(a ) shows , the bright end of the lf remains virtually unchanged , but the faint end evolves from @xmath1@xmath25 to at least @xmath1@xmath23 .",
    "our tests show that it is highly unlikely that this observed differential evolution is due to some systematic effect such as selection bias , our modeling of the survey volume , etc.(for details see * ? ? ?",
    "the effect is also quite significant  the statistical probability that the @xmath1@xmath24@xmath163 evolution is _ not _ differential with luminosity is only 1.5% , and the result is even more robust for @xmath1@xmath25@xmath163 .",
    "we conclude that the _ differential , luminosity - dependent evolution _ is very likely real .",
    "if so , it must reflect some real , intrinsic evolutionary differences between faint and luminous lbgs .",
    "understanding what causes these differences will give us insights into what drives galaxy evolution at high redshift .",
    "the importance of the lf s faint end extends into measurements of the cosmic luminosity density and the cosmic star formation rate that is often derived from it . for reasonable faint - end slopes of the lf",
    "the bulk of the luminosity density resides in galaxies that are fainter than @xmath0 and it is only with deep , multi - field , large - area surveys such as ours that it is possible to reliably measure the contribution of this dominant population .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows the evolution of the uv luminosity density using data from galex @xcite , keck sawicki & thompson ( 2006b ) , and subaru @xcite .",
    "the _ total _",
    "uv luminosity density , i.e. , luminosity density due to galaxies of _ all _ luminosities , rises from early epochs , @xmath1@xmath175 , experiences either a plateau or a broad peak at @xmath1@xmath231 , and then a decline to @xmath1=0 .",
    "this behavior of the total luminosity density is dominated not by luminous galaxies , but by sub-@xmath8 objects .",
    "indeed , it is galaxies within the rather narrow luminosity range @xmath6=(0.11)@xmath8 that dominate at high redshift , @xmath1@xmath225 , and it is the rapid evolution of this population that drives the evolution in the _ total _ uv luminosity density . thus far , this faint population has been largely neglected in high-@xmath1 follow - up studies which have focused on @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath8 lbgs .",
    "in contrast to @xmath1@xmath172 , at lower redshifts , @xmath1@xmath181 , the total uv luminosity density is dominated by _ very _ faint galaxies with @xmath6@xmath190.1@xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6=(0.11)@xmath8 galaxies that dominated at @xmath1@xmath172 are still important but no longer dominant .",
    "this switch in the luminosity of the galaxies that dominate the total luminosity density is reminiscent of galaxy downsizing , although the effect we see so far is a downsizing in uv luminosity rather than galaxy mass .",
    "as we have discussed above , sub-@xmath0 lbgs dominate over their more luminous cousins , but evolve differently from them as a population .",
    "we now wish to know what makes them _ physically _ different .",
    "we attempt to address this issue through broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) studies . unlike in the lf work",
    ", here we do not need large samples of objects but instead must have deep multiwavelength photometry that spans from the uv to beyond the balmer break in the rest frame .",
    "we need to go particularly deep because we wish to study galaxies significantly fainter than @xmath0 at @xmath1@xmath52 .",
    "no spectroscopic samples of such very faint lbgs currently exist and so we must use photometric redshifts .",
    "our first foray into this area is at @xmath1@xmath22 and uses the hst wfpc2+nicmos @xmath20 data of the northern hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "these data are ideal for us as they are very deep , include the @xmath21-band imaging essential for selecting @xmath1@xmath22 lbgs , and span the age - sensitive balmer break at the target epoch .    after smoothing the multiband images to a common psf and obtaining sextractor @xcite photometry",
    ", we constructed a @xmath21-band drop - out sample using the lbg color - color selection criteria defined by steidel et al ,  ( 1996 ) for the hdf .",
    "we then applied a photometric redshift cut , 1.8@xmath18@xmath22@xmath182.6 , where the photometric redshifts are determined as part of the sed - fitting procedure ( see below ) .",
    "the lower limit of this photo-@xmath1 cut eliminates potential low-@xmath1 interlopers and the higher limit excludes high-@xmath1 lbgs for which the @xmath20 filter set does not span the crucial , age - sensitive balmer break .",
    "this procedure ( two - color selection followed by a photo-@xmath1 cut ) is very similar to the procedure ( two - color selection followed by spectroscopy ) used by @xcite in their work .",
    "our resulting sample of @xmath270 objects has a mean redshift @xmath23=2.3 and in other ways also closely mimics the bx samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , it contains much fainter galaxies , reaching down to @xmath24=27 .",
    "magnitude is defined via averaging the @xmath25 and @xmath26 fluxes . ]",
    "our sed fitting procedure follows the now well - established approach first developed for lbgs by @xcite and subsequently used by many others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we compare the observed @xmath27 is essential for _ selecting _ our lbg sample , we omit it from the sed fitting to avoid contaminating our sed analysis with the stochastic effects of intergalactic hydrogen absorption . ]",
    "galaxy photometry with predictions of @xcite spectral synthesis models attenuated by @xcite dust .",
    "we fix metallicity and star formation history and fit for burst age , star formation rate , stellar mass , dust reddening , and redshift .",
    "while for brighter samples redshifts are usually constrained from spectroscopy , here we must keep redshift as a free parameter .",
    "however , our tests as well as previous experience with this approach @xcite show that lack of spectroscopic redshifts does not significantly affect the results .",
    "[ sedfit.fig ]      figure  2a shows that the bulk of the galaxies in our hdf sample follows a relation between stellar mass and uv luminosity and this relation extends into the brighter galaxies of @xcite .",
    "there appears to be good correlations between stellar mass and uv luminosity ( fig .",
    "2a ) and stellar mass and sfr ( fig .  2b ) .",
    "outliers in both samples turn out to be galaxies with constant - sfr best - fit ages apparently older than the age of the universe at @xmath1@xmath282.3 ( triangles ) and galaxies with very young ages @xmath29@xmath1930gyr ( squares ) . however , most objects show a fairly tight correlation which can be described by the relation @xmath30 $ ] ( solid line in fig",
    "the inclusion of the outliers in the fit does not significantly affect this result .    the @xmath0 knee in the @xmath1@xmath22.2 lf ( @xmath31=@xmath32 at @xmath1@xmath22.2 : sawicki & thompson , 2006a ) corresponds to a stellar mass @xmath33@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 ( fig  2a ) .",
    "this @xmath1@xmath22 characteristic mass is remarkably similar to the 3@xmath3410@xmath3@xmath4 characteristic mass that at low redshift marks the transition between the two distinct galaxy `` bimodality '' families @xcite .",
    "this similarity of characteristic masses suggests that the processes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) responsible for the observed galaxy bimodality at low @xmath1 may have also been operating at @xmath1@xmath22 . moreover , the near - unity slope of the logarithmic relation between stellar mass and uv luminosity ( fig .",
    "2a ) suggests that the bulk of the detectable stellar mass in @xmath1@xmath22.2 lbgs resides in the thus - far poorly studied galaxies with @xmath0@xmath5@xmath6@xmath50.1@xmath0 , just as does the bulk of the total uv luminosity density .",
    "the outliers with extremely young fit ages ( square symbols ) are apparently either undermassive for their sfrs or overluminous for their masses . in the former case they may move up onto the mass - sfr relation as they age ; in the latter they could be experiencing strong star - forming bursts that dramatically elevate their normally low luminosities .",
    "outliers with very old best - fit ages ( triangles ) , are also consistent with variable star formation histories : constant star formation histories tend to yield the largest ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus the old ages here may simply be telling us that star formation in these galaxies was more intense in the past .",
    "all these scenarios advocate that at least some @xmath1@xmath22 lbgs , both faint and luminous , have variable star formation histories  consistent with one of the scenarios proposed by @xcite to explain the evolving lbg luminosity function .",
    "the thus - far largely unexplored sub-@xmath0 lbgs dominate the uv luminosity density of the universe at @xmath1@xmath52 .",
    "moreover , their stellar masses appear to correlate with uv luminosities down to very faint magnitudes at least at @xmath1@xmath22 and so , just as they dominate the uv luminosity density , these objects may also contain a substantial fraction of the formed stellar mass by that redshift . at the same time",
    ", however , the differentially - evolving luminosity function suggests that these sub-@xmath0 lbgs differ substantially from their more luminous cousins .",
    "it is not yet clear what mechanism is behind this differential evolution , but the bursty nature of at least some of the @xmath1@xmath22 galaxies means that changes in the timescales of star - burst episodes may play a role .",
    "we will address this and other issues as we extend our sed - fitting and other differential studies to higher redshifts ."
