    "three - wave mixing is very fundamental in nonlinear quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "it can be used to generate single photon or entangled photon pairs .",
    "three - wave mixing can also be used to convert the frequency of the weak electromagnetic filed or amplify the weak electromagnetic signal by virtue of another strong driving field . in atomic systems with inversion symmetry",
    ", the three - wave mixing can only occur in a parametric way because of the selection rule in the electric - dipole interaction between the atoms and electric fields .",
    "thus , the nonlinear interaction strength of the three - wave mixing is usually weak in the natural atomic systems .",
    "in contrast to the parametric weak nonlinearity realized by the virtual single- or two - photon processes , the nonlinear interaction strength can be increased significantly when the real energy exchange is involved .",
    "for example , in molecular systems  @xcite , the inversion symmetry can be broken , and the transitions between any two energy levels are possible . in such cases , the three - wave mixing processing can be realized using real energy transitions between energy levels . in artificial atoms ,",
    "e.g. , semiconducting quantum dots or superconducting quantum circuits ( sqcs ) , the inversion symmetry of their potential energy can be artificially controlled by externally applied field , that is , the selection rule of the artificial atoms can be engineered .",
    "thus , they provide us a new platform to manipulate and engineer linear and nonlinear quantum processes . for example",
    ", the single photon strong coupling can be achieved between microwave and mechanical modes using a superconducting flux qubit  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to realize three - wave mixing using real energy transitions between energy levels of a single sqc  @xcite .",
    "the sqcs  @xcite are extensively explored for the realization of qubits which are basic building blocks of quantum information processing .",
    "these superconducting artificial atoms can also be used not only to demonstrate phenomena occurred in atomic physics and quantum optics , but also to show some novel results , which can not be found in natural atomic systems .",
    "for example , the dressed states  @xcite have been experimentally demonstrated using superconducting charge qubit circuits  @xcite .",
    "the autler - townes splitting  @xcite and coherent population trapping  @xcite have also been observed in three - level sqcs .",
    "experimentalists are trying to find a way to realize the electromagnetically induced transparency in varieties of three - level sqds  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the coexistence of single- and two - photon processes  @xcite in three - level superconducting flux qubit circuits  @xcite has been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite by designed circuit qed systems .",
    "however , such phenomenon can not be demonstrated using three - level natural atoms because of the electric - dipole transition rule .",
    "the microwave amplification has been experimentally demonstrated by a single three - level artificial atom in open one - dimensional space  @xcite , a dressed  @xcite or a doubly - dressed superconducting flux  @xcite qubit circuit .",
    "the coherent frequency conversion has be demonstrated using two internal degrees of freedom of a single dc - squid phase qubit circuit  @xcite .",
    "the parametric down conversion and squeezing of two - mode quantized microwave fields using circuit qed are theoretically studied  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the parametric three - wave mixing devices have also been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the amplifiers with single artificial atoms  @xcite are different from the josephson junction based parametric three - wave mixing devices  @xcite or amplifiers  @xcite .",
    "a main difference is that the real energy exchange between discrete energy levels is involved when the single artificial atom amplifiers are implemented .",

    "based on different configurations of the applied driving and probing fields , we classify our study into three types .",
    "we find that a single three - level superconducting flux qubit circuit is enough to complete the microwave frequency conversion , amplification ( or attenuation ) of weak signal fields .",
    "in particular , we find , ( i ) in the driving types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the three - level system can convert the driving and signal fields into the ones with new frequencies , which we call down conversion or up conversion , respectively . due to the energy loss in the reflection and conversion",
    ", the incident signal field suffers the attenuation after transmitted in these two driving types ; ( ii ) however , both amplification and attenuation can occur in the driving type ( 3 ) , whether the amplification or the attenuation depends on the parameter condition ; ( iii ) given a definite flux bias , when the driving and signal detunings are adjusted properly , the maximum conversion efficiencies and gains nearly do not depend on the driving strength .",

    "in contrast to large anharmonicity of the flux qubit circuits , the superconducting phase and xmon qubit circuits have small anharmonicity .",
    "therefore the information leakage should be more carefully studied when these processes are demonstrated .",
    "we note that the transmon qubit circuits  @xcite have well defined symmetry when the effective offset charge is at the optimal point , thus the transmon qubit circuit for its three lowest energy levels has ladder - type transitions , and the three - wave mixing can not be realized . however , when the effective offset charge is not at the optimal point , the three - wave mixing can also occur in such system .",
