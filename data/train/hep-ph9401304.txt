    "with the precise measurements of the @xmath1 mass from lep experiments , as well as other electroweak parameter measurements , the standard model of electromagnetic and weak interactions is being tested beyond tree level . even without knowing the masses for the top quark and the higgs boson , physical observables when compared to theoretical predictions constrain new physics.@xcite an improvement in the measurement of the @xmath4 mass , currently with a value of @xmath7 gev@xcite from cern@xcite and fermilab@xcite collider experiments , would even further those constraints . with the higher statistics expected in the 1993 - 1994 fermilab tevatron collider runs ,",
    "the theoretical and systematic errors must be also be reduced to make a significant improvement in the @xmath4 mass measurement . even though the dependence on the @xmath4 transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) is not very strong in the @xmath4 mass sample , the qcd predictions for the low @xmath2 production of @xmath4 s , including nonperturbative effects , must be better understood .",
    "the low @xmath2 behavior of @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s has been the subject of much theoretical work .",
    "the collins - soper - sterman formalism@xcite for the low transverse momentum distribution in drell - yan has been applied to @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s by davies , stirling and webber,@xcite altarelli _",
    "et al._,@xcite and the matching of low and high @xmath6 by arnold and kauffman.@xcite a study of the parameterization of nonperturbative effects in the low @xmath2 region has recently been done by ladinsky and yuan.@xcite theoretical uncertainties in the separate @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath2 distributions are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "we discuss the _ relative _ uncertainties between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 transverse momentum distributions . by considering the ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "the theoretical errors are reduced because the uncertainties tend to cancel . by comparing these quantities with experimental results , one can test the theoretical treatment of low @xmath2 vector bosons .",
    "alternatively , the ratios can be used in monte carlo models for the @xmath4 mass measurement .",
    "the estimation of the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath10 and @xmath11 due to the parameterization of nonperturbative effects is the main topic of this paper . in section 2 , we review the theoretical issues associated with the low transverse momentum behavior of @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s .",
    "our numerical results are displayed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions . as all of the relevant formulae are collected in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not include detailed formulae here .",
    "the calculation of the low transverse momentum behavior of @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s is not completely straightforward because of the presence of large logarithms associated with powers of @xmath12 . at low @xmath2 ,",
    "the perturbative expansion in @xmath13 is ruined because of the accompanying large logarithms . however , it is possible to resum the leading and next - to - leading @xmath14 powers for each power of @xmath13 to get an exponential factor .",
    "collins , soper and sterman have done the resummation,@xcite explicitly including transverse momentum conservation for multiple parton emission at each order in @xmath13 .",
    "the momentum conservation appears through a fourier transform involving the conjugate variable to @xmath2 , namely the impact parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the resummation appears as a sudakov - like exponent @xmath16 , which is incorporated in a form factor , here called @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 can be computed perturbatively over the range of @xmath18 .",
    "schematically @xmath19 \\ , .\\ ] ] the parton distribution functions @xmath20 are labeled for parton @xmath21 in hadron @xmath22 .",
    "the full perturbative form for @xmath17 also includes convolutions of the parton distribution functions with other functions which are suppressed by @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath24 depend on whether @xmath25 or @xmath26 .    including a normalization parameter @xmath27 or @xmath5",
    ", the differential cross section has the form @xmath28 in the low @xmath2 limit .",
    "4 applies only to the low @xmath2 limit because not included is the part of the cross section which is regular as @xmath29 .",
    "arnold and kauffman have shown that the regular part of the differential cross section for @xmath30 and @xmath31 has little effect below @xmath32 gev . as we shall see below",
    ", the nonperturbative contributions are sizable only for @xmath3 gev , so we consider this region of low @xmath2 and neglect the regular part throughout .",
    "the form factor @xmath17 depends on the impact parameter , the mass of the weak gauge boson and on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the hadron collider center of mass energy , and @xmath36 is the weak gauge boson rapidity .",
    "the form factor also includes the dependence on the parton distribution functions , the resummed terms , a nonperturbative factor and the unphysical factorization scale @xmath37 .    for @xmath38 , we roughly approximate @xmath17 , since in the integral in eqn .",
    "4 , this range of @xmath15 contributes little for @xmath3 gev . however , for @xmath39 , the perturbative expression for @xmath17 breaks down . a cutoff in @xmath15",
    "is introduced in the standard way by@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is characterized by a scale @xmath42 at which perturbation theory is still valid .",
    "the substitution of @xmath43 in @xmath44 is accompanied by a nonperturbative factor .",
    "thus , @xmath17 defined over the full range of @xmath15 is written this way : @xmath45 by combining eqns .",
    "( 3)-(6 ) , the main theoretical uncertainties are evident : dependence on the parton distributions and @xmath46 , the residual @xmath37 dependence , and the parameterization of the nonperturbative effects in @xmath47 .",
    "the nonperturbative effects dominate for @xmath48 gev , so we focus our attention on the nonperturbative parameterizations .    not indicated in the formulae above is an additional dependence on three unphysical constants denoted @xmath49 and @xmath50 in ref .",
    "arnold and kauffman showed that the dependence of @xmath51 for @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s on these three parameters is weak for a range of parameters.@xcite    the nonperturbative factor @xmath52 has the form:@xcite @xmath53 in principle , @xmath54 depends on the incoming parton type and is hadron dependent . following davies , stirling and webber@xcite",
    ", we will assume that @xmath54 is independent of parton type and independent of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "ladinsky and yuan include a dependence on @xmath55 and @xmath56 in their parameterization,@xcite which we comment on below .",
    "the standard assumption is that @xmath54 and @xmath57 are proportional to @xmath58,@xcite and @xmath47 is written in terms of constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 this is , at large @xmath15 , roughly equivalent to a gaussian distribution of intrinsic momentum . ignoring the @xmath15 dependence in @xmath44 ,",
    "one is left with the fourier transform of a gaussian , which is itself a gaussian .",
    "the average transverse momentum squared in the gaussian is @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "davies , stirling and webber@xcite have performed a fit to isr ( r209 ) and fermilab ( e288 ) fixed target data .",
    "their numerical values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are : @xmath63 with @xmath64 gev@xmath65 .",
    "the nonperturbative parameterization @xmath66 is their preferred fit .",
    "these parameters were used by arnold and kauffman in their analysis of theoretical errors in @xmath67 .",
    "evident from the discussion so far is the fact that the the distributions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 will not be very much different apart from the overall normalization factors and the combination of parton distribution functions , evaluated at slightly different values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we now proceed to consider the numerical results .",
    "in obtaining the numerical results , we have used @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 gev .",
    "the weak mixing angle was taken such that @xmath72 . to compare nonperturbative parameterizations ,",
    "we have used the harriman _",
    "et al._@xcite parton distribution functions hmrsb with the four flavor @xmath73 scale @xmath74 gev , based on a fit to the bcdms data .",
    "to compare the effect of a change in parton distribution functions on @xmath75 , we also use the hmrse distribution functions fit to the emc data with @xmath76 gev . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the canonical choices of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are used . here , @xmath79 is the euler constant .",
    "as indicated above , we neglect the regular part of the differential cross sections , which contribute on the order of less than 1% in the range of @xmath80 gev.@xcite all of the figures show results for the tevatron collider at @xmath81 tev .",
    "similar results obtain for the cern collider .",
    "the largest uncertainty for @xmath48 gev comes from the choice of parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 in eqn .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution @xmath82 at @xmath83 as a function of @xmath2 of the @xmath4 , including both charges of the @xmath4 in the rate .",
    "the three predictions vary from the average of the three curves by as much as 40% for very low @xmath2 . for @xmath84 gev ,",
    "the the sensitivity to the nonperturbative parameterization is significantly less .",
    "unfortunately , it is precisely below @xmath85 gev where the differential cross section is the largest .",
    "a similar uncertainty is obtained for the @xmath1 transverse momentum distribution as a function of the nonperturbative parameterization .    because the @xmath4 and @xmath5 masses are close and there is only log dependence on the masses , the nonperturbative parameterization @xmath47 and perturbative exponent @xmath86 are nearly identical for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "one expects that the ratio of the @xmath4 to @xmath5 transverse momentum distributions will be approximately constant for small @xmath2 . indeed , this is the case .",
    "figure 2 shows the relative size of the @xmath4 to @xmath5 distributions at @xmath83 for @xmath87 .",
    "qualitatively , the size of @xmath88 can be understood from a combination of coupling constants and parton distribution functions .",
    "consider the quantity @xmath89 by taking @xmath90 one obtains the value of 3.04 .",
    "if one were to evaluate the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parton luminosities at the same values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the ratio would equal 2.34 , as a consequence of their different coupling constants . deviations of the @xmath87 curves from the average value @xmath91 are less than a percent .    to understand the increase in @xmath92",
    "as @xmath2 decreases , it is useful to look at @xmath93 for @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s , which is independent of @xmath2 . in figure 3@xmath94",
    ", we show the form factors @xmath95 with @xmath96 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and with the nonperturbative parameters @xmath66 , as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "the low @xmath15 behavior is an extrapolation of the value of @xmath17 at @xmath98 , to lower values of @xmath15 .",
    "the integral over @xmath15 of @xmath17 also includes a factor of @xmath99 , so the differential distribution is fairly insensitive to such small values of @xmath15 where the extrapolation must be performed . for large values of @xmath15 , the nonperturbative parameterization cuts off the integral .",
    "figure 3@xmath15 shows the ratio of the form factors @xmath17 , for the three sets of nonperturbative parameters .",
    "we cut off the range of @xmath97 displayed because at low @xmath15 , the shape of the ratio is an artifact of the low @xmath15 extrapolation .",
    "the curves for @xmath87 separate at @xmath100gev@xmath65 , because of the mass dependence in @xmath52 , with the largest ratio belonging to @xmath101 .    at low @xmath2 ,",
    "the average value of @xmath15 is for `` large '' @xmath15 .",
    "for example , for @xmath4 s at @xmath102 gev , @xmath103 gev@xmath65 . as @xmath2 increases , the bessel function in the integral oscillates more rapidly as a function of @xmath15 , and @xmath104 decreases , moving into the perturbative range .",
    "thus , as @xmath2 increases , the sensitivity to nonperturbative physics decreases and the calculation is more reliable .",
    "figure 3@xmath15 also shows the trend that @xmath11 and @xmath10 decline with increasing @xmath2 . if one trusts the form of the nonperturbative parameterization , then the uncertainty in @xmath88 is less than a few percent .",
    "even if one estimates the uncertainty in @xmath92 by the deviation from the ratio of coupling constants and parton distribution functions , one is still left with a small uncertainty due to nonperturbative parameterizations of order @xmath105 .",
    "figure 4 shows the ratio @xmath11 ( where now the rapidity of the gauge boson has been integrated ) for @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the shapes of the distributions are nearly identical to those of figure 2 , however , with an increase in the normalization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ratio of the @xmath4 to @xmath5 parton luminosities increases with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "we have the same qualitative conclusions about the uncertainty in the ratio @xmath11 as in the @xmath83 case .",
    "the ladinsky - yuan parameterization@xcite is characterized by three parameters and depends on @xmath16 as well as @xmath107 . in a recent reanalysis of the r209 and",
    "e288 low @xmath2 drell - yan data , ladinsky and yuan ( ly ) have postulated a modified form for @xmath52 : @xmath108 the inclusion of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 dependence is to account for changing @xmath109 as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath2 distributions have peaks at slightly higher @xmath2 values than in the two parameter cases .",
    "we use their central values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 to characterize the effects of this parameterization on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "their central values are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and their fit was performed using the cteq parton distribution functions.@xcite as we are interested primarily in the ratios , we continue to use the hmrsb parton distribution functions .",
    "the ly curve for @xmath11 at @xmath116 tev is shown as the dotted line in figure 4 .",
    "the deviation from the two parameter result is less than a few percent .",
    "figure 5 shows the ratio of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath2 distributions for two different parton distribution functions .",
    "we show @xmath75 for the hmrsb and hmrse parton distribution functions with @xmath66 .",
    "the hmrse distributions yield the slightly lower value of @xmath92 , but the two predictions for @xmath117 are within 2% of each other at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 determined by davies _ et al._@xcite are clearly not the best current values because of the advances in our knowledge of the parton distribution functions .",
    "ladinsky and yuan,@xcite by refitting the data with current parton distributions , have made a significantly better choice .",
    "nevertheless , uncertainties still exist in the form of the parameterization , affecting the extrapolation from @xmath118 gev to @xmath119 gev .",
    "parton distribution uncertainties at large @xmath107 compound the uncertainties.@xcite    we have shown that by taking the ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xmath2 distributions , the theoretical uncertainties due to the parameterization of nonperturbative effects tend to cancel . for the range of @xmath80 gev , the ratio @xmath11 is @xmath120 , slightly higher or lower depending on @xmath2 . when one takes the ratio of the total cross sections obtained by integrating the resummed , matched differential cross sections@xcite for @xmath66 , one obtains @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath92 is less than 3.3 because with increasing @xmath2 , @xmath11 declines roughly linearly , with @xmath122 gev@xmath123.@xcite    in our focus on the nonperturbative effects , we have neglected the regular part of the differential cross section which comes in at the percent level .",
