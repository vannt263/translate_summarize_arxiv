    "a definition of lattice chiral gauge theories is one of the long - standing problems in the lattice field theory , in spite of its success as the non - perturbative calculational method for vector gauge theories such as qcd .",
    "the difficulty is related to the no - go theorem@xcite , which proves , under the mild conditions , that it is impossible to define chirally invariant lattice fermion without species doubling . despite many attempts to put chiral gauge theories on the lattice for many years",
    ", so far none of them has been proven to work successfully .    through analyses of many unsuccessful attempts@xcite , however",
    ", a common reason of failures has been recently recognized , called the `` rough gauge problem''@xcite , which we will explain below .",
    "a proposed lattice fermion action for one fermion field ( in an anomalous representation ) necessarily breaks gauge invariance , to reproduce the chiral gauge anomaly in the weak gauge coupling limit , though it may be cancelled by the contribution from other fermion fields .",
    "because of this explicit gauge breaking , the gauge degree of freedom , which varies independently at each site , can not be gauged away and thus interacts with the fermion , so that the fermion is not a free field even in the weak gauge coupling limit .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the roughness of the gauge degree of freedom is an essential reason for failure of the proposals such as the wilson - yukawa model@xcite , the u(1 ) original domain - wall model@xcite and its variant@xcite , though the detail of the failure depends on the proposal .    by adding the kinetic term for the gauge degree of freedom to the action",
    ", one can make it smooth enough to have a desired chiral fermion spectrum .",
    "it has been shown in 4 dimensional models that the dynamics of this smoothed gauge degree ( = scalar field ) simultaneously leads to the condensation of the scalar field , which makes the gauge field massive in lattice unit , so that no chiral gauge theory is defined in the continuum limit .",
    "this unsatisfactory correspondence that symmetric phase - vector spectrum or higgs phase - chiral spectrum seems to be established almost for all models .",
    "recently , it is , however , claimed that this correspondence is not true and thus the rough gauge problem might be solved if the dynamics of the gauge degree of freedom becomes asymptotic - free@xcite .",
    "it is actually shown in the spin wave calculation that the rough configuration decouples from the fermion in the overlap formula@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pursue this possibility further , using the quenched numerical simulation of the original domain - wall model , where the gauge degree of freedom corresponds to the gauge field in the extra dimension .",
    "previously we studied the original domain - wall model with u(1 ) gauge group both in 2(+1 ) and 4(+1 ) dimensions , whose gauge field in the extra dimension has the asymptotic _",
    "non_-free dynamics and indeed found no chiral zero mode in the symmetric phase .",
    "in contrast , we consider here the su(2 ) gauge group in 2(+1 ) dimensions , where the gauge field in the extra dimension is equivalent to an asymptotic - free su(2 ) @xmath0 su(2 ) non - linear @xmath1 model .",
    "therefore there is only one phase , symmetric phase , in the model . by the quenched monte - carlo simulation of the model we investigate an existence of chiral zero modes near and below the scaling region of the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the original domain - wall model in sec.[sec : model ] . in sec.[sec : analysis ] the method of our analyses is explained , then the results are shown .",

    ". the fermion propagator is obtained from the average over 50 configurations and the errors are estimated by jack - knife method with an unit bin size .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfb ] the fermion mass extracted in this way is plotted as a function of @xmath48 at @xmath611.0 and 2.0 on @xmath62 lattices with @xmath638 , 16 , 32 and @xmath64 .",
    "this figure shows that the right - handed mode becomes massless when @xmath48 is grater than some critical value : @xmath65 .",
    "for example , @xmath66 at @xmath67 and @xmath68 at @xmath42",
    ". on the other hand , the left - handed mode are massive at all @xmath48 .",
    "it also shows that the finite size effect is small between @xmath43 and @xmath69 , though some effect is seen , in particular at @xmath70 , for @xmath71 .",
    "this lattice size dependence of fermion masses is consistent with the one of the correlation length of the scalar field , and is very different from the size dependence of the fermion mass for asymptotic non - free cases@xcite .",
    "these results strongly indicate that the chiral fermion spectrum observed on @xmath43 and 32 remains in the infinite volume limit : the chiral zero modes exist on the wall in the infinite lattice volume of 2-dimensional physical space - time .",
    "in addition to the analysis on the fermion masses , we carry out the mean - field analysis , which has been shown to be successful to explain not only the existence of the critical value of the domain wall mass , but also the behavior of the fermion propagator@xcite .",
    "we fit the measured propagator with the form of the mean - field propagator obtained by replacing the link variable to some unknown but constant value @xmath72 .",
    "note that non - zero value of @xmath72 means an existence of the chiral zero mode for the range that @xmath73 .",

    "depends very weakly on @xmath48 while it increases as @xmath48 approaches to 1 at @xmath75 .",
    "a similar @xmath48 dependence to the latter case has been also seen previously for asymptotic non - free cases@xcite . since @xmath72 should be constant on @xmath48",
    "if the mean - field approximation is exact , this @xmath48 dependence shows the magnitude of the error for the mean - field approximation . again",
    "the finite size effect is small between @xmath43 and 32 , contrary to the case of the asymptotic non - free dynamics@xcite , and no indication that @xmath72 goes to zero as volume increases is observed . in conclusion",
    "the mean - filed analysis also supports , at least at @xmath74 , the existence of the chiral zero mode on the wall in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in this paper we numerically investigate an existence of chiral zero modes of the original domain - wall model in the presence of asymptotic - free dynamics in 2(+1 ) dimensions using the quenched simulation .",
    "the result of the fermion mass on @xmath76 and @xmath77 suggests that the chiral zero mode observed on the domain - wall at @xmath49 will survive in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the mean - field analysis of the fermion propagator also supports this conclusion .",
    "although the positive indication is obtained for the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories via the domain - wall model with asymptotic - free dynamics , we have to understand a difference between an asymptotic - free and an asymptotic non - free cases more deeply .",
    "it is usually thought that the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field controls the existence of the chiral zero mode in the model : if non - zero the zero mode exists , if not it does not . in terms of the mean field analysis , @xmath72 is supposed to correspond to the vacuum expectation value .",
    "this is a crucial property for the failure of the domain - wall model in the symmetric phase , and this seems true for an asymptotic non - free dynamics@xcite .",
    "however the result of this paper shows that this does not hold anymore for the asymptotic - free dynamics .",
    "then , what controls the existence of zero modes ?",
    "what corresponds to @xmath72 ?",
    "it is likely that some function of the correlation length does it .",
    "since the phase is unique for the su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) non - linear @xmath1 model in 2 dimensions , the function should be analytic in the correlation length , so that it can vanish only on some points of @xmath35 , but not in the non - zero region of @xmath35 .",
    "it is more likely that it vanishes only at @xmath78 .",
    "if this is true the zero mode exists for all @xmath35 except @xmath79 .",
    "however since the scalar field near @xmath78 is very rough , the dynamics is very similar to that in the symmetric phase of the asymptotic non - free model .",
    "therefore an existence of zero mode near @xmath78 may imply an existence of the zero mode also in the symmetric phase of the asymptotic non - free model .",
    "this seems inconsistent with the previous numerical results@xcite .",
    "the one of solution to this puzzle is perhaps that the allowed range of the domain - wall mass @xmath48 for the zero mode (:",
    "@xmath80 ) is too narrow to be detected in the numerical simulation at the accuracy of ref .",
    "this point should be clarified , in order to establish the existence of the chiral zero mode of the asymptotic - free model without doubt .",
    "since scalar field theories with second derivative terms are asymptotic non - free in 4 dimensions , higher derivative terms have to be introduced to make them asymptotic - free@xcite . since , in terms of gauge fields , these higher derivative terms correspond to the gauge fixing terms , the solution to the rough gauge problem by the asymptotic - free dynamics in 4 dimensions is very similar to the recent proposal to the problem by the gauge fixing for the u(1 ) theory@xcite .",
    "the relation between the two should be understood .",
    "if the rough gauge problem of the chiral zero mode in the domain - wall model can indeed be solved by an asymptotic - free dynamics , the rough gauge problems appeared in other models such as the wilson - yukawa model and the waveguide model are also resolved by the same dynamics .",
    "research in this direction is also necessary in order to define lattice chiral gauge theories ultimately .",
