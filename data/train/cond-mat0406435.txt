    "based on low temperature resistivity and heat capacity measurements in applied magnetic fields ybagge was recently classified as a new heavy fermion material with long range , possibly small moment , magnetic order below 1 k @xcite that shows magnetic field induced non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior @xcite .",
    "the critical field required to drive ybagge to the field - induced quantum critical point ( qcp ) is anisotropic ( @xmath3 45 koe , @xmath4 80 koe ) and conveniently accessible by many experimental groups @xcite .",
    "ybagge is one of the _ rarae aves _ of intermetallics ( apparently only second , after the extensively studied ybrh@xmath5si@xmath5 @xcite ) a _ stoichiometric _ , yb - based , heavy fermion ( hf ) that shows magnetic field induced nfl behavior and as such is suitable to serve as a testing ground for experimental and theoretical constructions relevant for qcp physics . among the surfeit of detailed descriptions developed for a material near the antiferromagnetic qcp",
    "we will refer to the outcomes @xcite of two more general , competing , pictures : in one viewpoint the qcp is a spin density wave ( sdw ) instability @xcite of the fermi surface ; within the second picture that originates in the description of heavy fermions as a kondo lattice of local moments @xcite , heavy electrons are composite bound states formed between local moments and conduction electrons and the qcp is associated with the breakdown of this composite nature .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that hall effect measurements can help distinguish which of these two mechanisms may be relevant for a particular material near a qcp . in the sdw scenario the hall coefficient is expected to vary continuously through the quantum phase transition , whereas in the composite hf scenario the hall coefficient is anticipated to change discontinuously at the qcp .",
    "perhaps more importantly , in both scenarios a clear and sharp change in the field dependent hall effect ( for the field - induced qcp ) is anticipated to occur at low temperatures , near the critical field value .",
    "although hall effect measurements appear to be a very attractive method of gaining insight into the nature of the qcp , one has to keep in mind that an understanding of the different contributions to the measured hall coefficient , in particular in magnetic or strongly correlated materials , is almost inevitably difficult and potentially evasive @xcite .",
    "therefore measurements on samples well characterized by other techniques @xcite as well as comparison with non - magnetic as well as non - hf members of the same series can be beneficial . in this work we present",
    "temperature- and field- dependent hall effect measurements on ybagge single crystals . the non - magnetic member of the same ragge ( r = rare earth ) series , luagge , and the magnetic , essentially non - hybridizing , tmagge were used for  common sense  checks , or calipers , of the ybagge measurements .",
    "ybagge , luagge and tmagge single crystals in the form of clean , hexagonal - cross - section rods of several mm length and up to 1 mm@xmath6 cross section were grown from high temperature ternary solutions rich in ag and ge ( see @xcite for details of the samples growth ) .",
    "their structure and the absence of impurity phases were confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction .",
    "temperature and field dependent hall resistivity , @xmath7 , and auxiliary high field magnetization measurements were performed down to 1.9 k , in an applied magnetic field of up to 140 koe in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument . for ybagge hall measurements",
    "were extended down to 0.4 k using the he-3 option of the ppms-14 . a four probe , ac technique ( @xmath8 = 16 hz , @xmath9 = 1 - 0.1 ma ) , was used for the hall measurements .",
    "samples were polished down to a plate - like shape with thicknesses of 0.3 - 0.4 mm .",
    "pt leads were attached to the sample with epotek h20e silver epoxy so that the current was flowing along the crystallographic @xmath10 axis . for the @xmath11 case hall resistivity ( @xmath12 )",
    "was measured in the hexagonal crystallographic plane ( approximately along @xmath13 $ ] direction ) with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to both the current and the hall voltage directions ( approximately along @xmath14 $ ] direction ) ( see the lower inset to figure [ rhlutm ] ) . in the @xmath2 case",
    ", current was flowing in the hexagonal plane , approximately in @xmath13 $ ] direction , the hall voltage was measured along @xmath14 $ ] direction . due to rod - like morphology of the crystals , samples that were cut and polished for @xmath2 measurements",
    "were smaller and the error bars in the absolute values ( due to geometry and position of the contacts ) are larger than for the @xmath11 data sets . to eliminate the effect of inevitable ( small ) misalignment of the voltage contacts ,",
    "the hall measurements were taken for two opposite directions of the applied field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the odd component , @xmath17 was taken as the hall resistivity . to determine the hall resistivity in the limit of low field , linear fits of the initial ( linear ) parts of the @xmath18 data in both quadrants",
    "were used .",
    "he-4 hall measurements for ybagge and luagge were performed on two samples of each material , the results were the same within the error bars in sample dimensions and contact position measurements . during the measurements",
    "particular care was taken to avoid rotation and/or misplacement of the tmagge sample due to its magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the field - dependent hall resistivity for luagge for @xmath11 is shown in the upper inset to fig . [ rhlutm](a ) for several temperatures .",
    "@xmath12 is only slightly non - linear in field over the whole temperature range .",
    "this minor non - linearity causes some difference in the @xmath19 _ vs. _ @xmath20 data obtained in different applied fields ( fig .",
    "[ rhlutm](a ) ) .",
    "the hall coefficient , @xmath21 , is measured to be negative .",
    "the overall temperature dependence is monotonic , slow and featureless with approximately a factor of two increase in the absolute value of @xmath19 from room temperature to low temperatures .",
    "this temperature - dependency of the hall coefficient of the non - magnetic material possibly reflects some details of its electronic structure ( for example , comparable factor of 2 changes in @xmath22 were recently observed in latin@xmath23 , t = rh , ir , co , @xcite ) . overall the temperature- and field - dependence of the hall coefficient for tmagge ( fig . [ rhlutm](b ) ) is similar to that of luagge with two main differences : ( i)the long range order and metamagnetism of tmagge @xcite is reflected in hall measurements as a low temperature decrease in @xmath24 and as anomalies in @xmath25 for @xmath26 2 k that are consistent with the fields of the metamagnetic transitions ; ( ii)the absolute values of the @xmath27 data for tmagge are a factor of 3 - 4 smaller than for luagge .      the temperature dependent hall coefficient and the dc susceptibility data for ybagge with the same orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the crystallographic axis are shown in fig .",
    "[ rhmtyb ] .",
    "the susceptibility , @xmath28 , is field - independent above  50 k ( _ i.e. _ @xmath29 is linear below 140 koe in this temperature range ) and is similar to the data reported in @xcite .",
    "the hall coefficient , @xmath22 , is field - independent above approximately 25 k. the temperature dependencies of the susceptibility and the hall coefficient at high temperatures closely resemble each other . at low temperatures a field - dependent maximum in @xmath22 ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ rhmtyb ] ) is observed .",
    "qualitatively the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient is consistent with the picture presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . within this picture",
    "the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient in heavy fermion materials is a result of two contributions : a residual hall coefficient , @xmath30 , and a hall coefficient due to the intrinsic skew scattering , @xmath31 .",
    "the residual hall coefficient is ascribed to a combination of the ordinary hall effect and residual skew scattering by defects and impurities and , to the first approximation , is considered to be temperature - independent , although , realistically , both the ordinary hall effect and the residual skew scattering may have weak temperature dependence .",
    "the temperature - dependent , intrinsic skew scattering contribution ( @xmath32 ) at high temperatures ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the kondo temperature ) increases as the temperature is lowered in a manner that is mainly due to the increasing magnetic susceptibility . at lower temperatures @xmath32 passes through a crossover regime , then has a peak at a temperature on the order of the coherence temperature , @xmath35 , and finally , on further cooling rapidly decreases ( in the coherent regime of skew scattering by fluctuations ) to zero ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ultimately levels off to the @xmath36 value at very low temperatures @xcite ) . in the high temperature ( @xmath33 ) limit we can ( very roughly , within an order of magnitude ) separate these two contributions to the observed temperature - dependent hall coefficient using a phenomenological expression @xmath37 @xcite with the temperature - dependent skew scattering contribution written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the curie constant , and @xmath41 is the weiss temperature . using @xmath42 = -15.1 k from @xcite we can plot @xmath43 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ rht ] ) and from the linear part of the curve we can estimate @xmath45 0.02 n@xmath46 cm / oe and @xmath47 -0.17 n@xmath46 cm",
    "it seems peculiar that our estimate of @xmath48 for ybagge differs noticeably from the hall coefficient measurements for luagge and tmagge ( see fig .",
    "[ rhlutm ] ) . regarding this discrepancy",
    "it should be mentioned that besides possible experimental ( mainly geometrical ) errors these three materials may have different residual skew scattering and , additionally , as indicated by the preliminary results of band structure calculations @xcite , the density of states at the fermi level can be considerably different for all three compounds under consideration . although the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath49 of tmagge above the nel temperature has a clear curie - weiss behavior @xcite , in contrast to the case of ybagge , the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient for tmagge ( fig .",
    "[ rhlutm](b ) ) does not have a similar functional form .",
    "the reason for this difference is apparently the very small skew scattering contribution ( @xmath50 ) to the hall coefficient in tmagge .",
    "similarly small couplings of local moment magnetism with the hall effect has been seen in other rare earth intermetallics , _",
    "e.g. _ rni@xmath5b@xmath5c ( r = rare earth ) borocarbides @xcite .",
    "in order to further explore the low temperature behavior of the hall coefficient , measurements down to 0.4 k were performed .",
    "the results ( on a semi -_log _ scale ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ rhltyb ] .",
    "the data taken in applied fields of 75 koe and higher show the expected levelling off of the @xmath24 as @xmath51 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the measured value of @xmath52 is close to the aforementioned estimate of the residual hall coefficient .",
    "this agreement suggests that at the lowest temperatures the hall coefficient is dominated by @xmath48 and , barring the residual skew scattering contribution , can probe the concentration of the electronic carriers .    whereas the higher field values of the hall coefficient vary smoothly with temperature ( fig .",
    "[ rhltyb ] ) , the low field data , below @xmath53 3 k , show large variations .",
    "although the signal to noise ratio in the low field measurements is inherently lower , these variations appear to be above the noise level ( fig .",
    "[ rhltyb ] , inset ) and the peaks slightly above 0.6 k and 1.0 k are understood as the signatures of the magnetic transitions in ybagge @xcite that are suppressed ( in this orientation ) when a 75 koe , or higher , magnetic field is applied .    to further study the field - induced qcp in ybagge , field",
    "dependent hall resistance measurements were performed at different temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ rhhyb ] ) .",
    "although the theoretical constructions are usually formulated in terms of the hall _ coefficient _ , not hall _ resistivity _ , in the case of ybagge the magnetic field itself is a control parameter for the qcp that makes the proper definition of the hall coefficient ambiguous .",
    "we will continue presenting our data as hall resistivity , since it is a quantity unambiguously extracted from the measurements , and leave the discussion on the suitable definition of the hall coefficient for the appendix .    for temperatures at and above @xmath5410",
    "k , the @xmath25 behavior is monotonic and , at higher temperatures , eventually linear ( fig .",
    "[ rhhyb](b ) ) .",
    "this type of behavior has been observed in a number of different materials in the paramagnetic state @xcite .",
    "the low temperature evolution of the @xmath25 behavior is more curious ( fig .",
    "[ rhhyb](a ) ) and ought to be compared with the phase diagram obtained for ybagge ( @xmath11 ) in @xcite ( an augmented version of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ pd ] below ) .",
    "the lines in fig . [",
    "rhhyb](a ) roughly connect the points according to the phase lines in @xcite ( see also fig . [ pd ] below ) .",
    "it can be seen that the lower @xmath55 magnetically ordered phase line possibly has ( despite the scattering of the points ) correspondent features in @xmath25 , and the coherence line in @xcite ( and fig .",
    "[ pd ] ) roughly corresponds to the beginning of the high field linear behavior in @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher @xmath55 magnetically ordered phase line can not unambiguously be associated with any feature in @xmath25 curves .",
    "the most interesting feature shown in fig .",
    "[ rhhyb](a ) though is the presence of the pronounced peak , or local maximum , in @xmath25 that occurs at @xmath56 koe for the @xmath26 0.4 k curve and can be followed up to temperatures above long range magnetic order transition temperatures . for @xmath26 2.5 k a broad , local maximum in @xmath12 , centered at @xmath57 koe",
    "can just barely be discerned .",
    "as temperature is reduced this feature sharpens and moves down in field . for @xmath26 1 k the local maximum in @xmath12",
    "is clearly located at @xmath58 koe and by @xmath59 k @xmath12 has sharpened almost to the point of becoming discontinuous with @xmath60 koe .",

    "independent of any theory these data clearly show that ( i ) @xmath12 is an extremely sensitive method of determining @xmath64 of qcp , ( ii ) @xmath61 has a clear temperature dependence , and ( iii ) the qcp influences @xmath12 up to @xmath65 k , a temperature significantly higher than the @xmath66 antiferromagnetic ordering temperature .    the new phase line ( shown as stars in fig .",
    "[ pd ] ) associated with @xmath12 maximum is distinct from the lines inferred from @xmath67 and @xmath68 data @xcite . as @xmath51 this line approaches @xmath64 , but for finite @xmath20 it is well separated from the coherence line that was determined by the onset of @xmath69 resistivity behavior .",
    "this new @xmath61 line rather clearly locates @xmath64 at @xmath70 koe , the field at which the long range antiferromagnetic order appears to be suppressed .",
    "since the response of ybagge to an applied magnetic field is anisotropic @xcite , it is apposite to repeat the hall measurements for the magnetic field applied parallel to the crystallographic @xmath10-axis .",

    "[ rhltybc ] ( the low - field data were obtained as described above ) .",
    "the @xmath24 behavior for @xmath2 is qualitatively similar to that for @xmath11 with a broad maximum being shifted to @xmath71 k ( as compared to @xmath72 k for @xmath11 ) and being less sensitive to the applied field .",

    "[ pdc ] clearly demonstrating that , akin to the @xmath11 case , as @xmath51 , @xmath77 for the qcp .",
    "the @xmath25 behavior for this orientation is more complex , and there is an additional , broad maximum in lower fields ( @xmath58 koe at 0.4 k ) that fades out with increasing temperature .",
    "this highly non - monotonic in field behavior is the origin of the dissimilarities in the low temperature @xmath24 data ( fig .",

    "this new @xmath76 line rather clearly locates @xmath64 at @xmath78 koe , the field at which the long range antiferromagnetic order appears to be suppressed .",
    "it should be noted that the new lines in the @xmath55 phase diagrams were established from different types of extrema in @xmath25 , _ maximum _ for @xmath11 and _ minimum _ for @xmath2 .",

    "in such a case a change in the fermi surface may possibly have different signatures in the hall measurements with different field orientation .",

    "<S> hall coefficient of ybagge shows behavior similar to what has been observed in a number of heavy fermion compounds , the low temperature , field - dependent measurements reveal well defined , sudden changes with applied field ; in specific for @xmath0 a clear local maximum that sharpens as temperature is reduced below 2 k and that approaches a value of 45 koe - a value that has been proposed as the @xmath1 quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior was observed for @xmath2 where a clear minimum in the field - dependent hall resistivity was observed at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> although at our base temperatures it is difficult to distinguish between the field - dependent behavior predicted for ( i ) diffraction off a critical spin density wave or ( ii ) breakdown in the composite nature of the heavy electron , for both field directions there is a distinct temperature dependence of a feature that can clearly be associated with a field - induced quantum critical point at @xmath1 persisting up to at least 2 k. </S>"
