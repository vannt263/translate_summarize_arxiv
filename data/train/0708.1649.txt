    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are a cosmological phenomenon with a huge energy release , fast variabilities and very complex multi - wavelength light curves .",
    "a relativistic outflow is unavoidable in order to explain the fast variability and so called `` compactness problem '' ( see piran 2005 for a review ) . according to the standard `` fireball '' model",
    ", the outflow from the grb central engine has a finite duration and can have a wide range in its velocities , thus can be modeled by being made of discrete relativistic shells .",
    "these shells are responsible for the observed @xmath1-rays ( via internal shocks ) and for the afterglow emissions ( via external shocks ) ( cf .",
    "piran 2005 ) . in this picture , if one shell emits @xmath1-rays , some fraction of that emission should be scattered by shells behind , and the scattered emission would arrive at the observer at a different time , with a different flux and possibly at a different photon frequency .",
    "detection of the scattered photons would help us explore the properties of the grb ejecta and the late outflow .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a simple scenario , where only two consecutive shells are present : one shell radiates and the other receives some of this radiation and scatters it .",
    "the two shells can have different speeds and the shell that receives and scatters the emission can have an arbitrarily large time delay in its ejection from the central source , but it has to be behind the emitting shell . an observer detects the primary emission from the first shell and then the scattered emission from the second one at a later time because of the light - travel time .",
    "we calculate the ratio between these two emissions fluxes , the time delay in their arrival , the ratio between their frequencies and the ratio between their durations .",
    "early grb x - ray observations by _ swift _ have shown a `` canonical '' behavior that presents a puzzling shallow decay typically lasting for a few hours ( e.g. nousek et al .",
    "this decay phase is poorly understood ( see zhang 2007 for a review of current possible models ) .",
    "we will explore the possibility that this shallower decay could be due to the scattered emission .",
    "the scattering of the grb prompt emission photons by electrons or dust grains in a dense circum - burst environment has been investigated before ( e.g. , esin & blandford 2000 ; madau et al .",
    "2000 ; shao & dai 2007 ; heng et al .",
    "the scattering process we consider in this work happens within the grb outflows , which is a natural outcome of the outflow when it has a finite duration and a variable speed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first derive a general formula for the observed flux from a relativistic shell in  2 . in ",
    "3 we construct the flux and geometrical relations for a two - shell model .",
    "the formulae for the scattering process are developed in  4 .",
    "then we elaborate the primary and scattered emission relations such as time delay , frequency ratio and time duration ratio in  5 .",
    "we present the main result - the ratio between the scattered and the primary fluxes - in  6 .",
    "the application to the grb shallower decay data is presented in  7 .",
    "a faster scattering shell case is discussed in  8 .",
    "we also discuss x - ray dim bursts and x - ray - dark short bursts , for which the scattered emission might be easier to detect , in  9 .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are given in  10 .",
    "consider a spherical shell moving relativistically with lorentz factor ( lf ) @xmath2 ( when the shell is beamed with an opening angle @xmath3 , it still can be considered as being spherical ) .",
    "the surface brightness in the rest frame of the shell is @xmath4 ( erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 ) , the luminosity distance between the observer and the shell is @xmath7 and the radius of the shell is @xmath8 , both of these distances measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "the flux density received at a frequency @xmath9 by the observer ahead of the shell , @xmath10 , can be obtained by calculating the specific luminosity of the relativistic shell .",
    "the luminosity of the shell is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the last expression includes a factor of @xmath2 , to take into account the `` boost '' that the photons experience ; and a factor of @xmath12 , since we assume that the photons are being emitted isotropically from the shell , in the rest frame of the shell , and we are only interested in the ones reaching the observer .",
    "the two expressions yield    @xmath13",
    "consider now two thin shells being ejected with an half opening angle of @xmath14 from the central engine .",
    "shell 1 is ejected first with lf @xmath15 and , after a delay @xmath16 , measured in the laboratory frame , shell 2 is ejected with lf @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that shell 1 is emitting photons isotropically in its co - moving frame and is characterized by an angular - independent surface brightness , @xmath4 , on both sides of the shell . in the laboratory frame",
    "most of these photons will appear to move in the same direction as shell 1 and reach a distant observer , and a few will move in the opposite direction , encountering shell 2 on their way .",
    "these photons will be scattered by shell 2 and then reach the observer . see figure 1 for an illustration .",
    "we will use primed quantities to specify the co - moving frame where the quantity is being measured : unprimed corresponds to the laboratory frame , primed ( @xmath18 ) to the co - moving frame of shell 1 , and double primed ( @xmath19 ) to the co - moving frame of shell 2 .    before proceeding with the detailed calculations about the scattered emission",
    ", we provide simple scaling relationships between the observed scattered emission and the observed direct emission from shell 1 by only considering the line - of - sight region .",
    "let us assume @xmath9 is the photon frequency of the direct emission from shell 1 . in the shell 1 co - moving frame , the emitted photon frequency is @xmath20 due to the relativistic doppler effect ( for simplicity we neglect the factor of 2 ) .",
    "as seen by shell 2 the photon has a frequency of @xmath21 .",
    "if shell 2 is cold , the scattering does not change the photon s energy .",
    "the observed frequency of the scattered emission is @xmath22 .",
    "thus the observed frequency ratio between the two emissions is @xmath23 .",
    "the scattered emission will be observed at a later time , because the scattered photon has traveled an extra distance .",
    "this extra distance is equal to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance of shell 1 from the central engine when a photon was emitted from shell 1 toward shell 2 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are shell 1 and shell 2 velocities , respectively ( the first part of the expression is due to the difference in the speeds of the shells , and the second part is due to the ejection delay of shell 2 ) .",
    "the observed delay of the scattered emission is this separation divided by the speed of light @xmath28 for small @xmath16 , where @xmath29 is the observed time of the shell 1 direct emission since the central engine explosion .",
    "if @xmath30 is the luminosity observed directly from shell 1 , the shell 1 co - moving frame luminosity would be @xmath31 . in the shell 2 co - moving frame",
    ", shell 1 has a luminosity of @xmath32 . using the lorentz invariance of @xmath33",
    "we find that the luminosity ratio , @xmath34 , is the frequency ratio to the fourth power , or @xmath35 . in the shell 2 co - moving frame , @xmath36 is the luminosity of the scattered emission , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the shell 2 electron s optical depth .",
    "then the observed luminosity of the scattered emission is @xmath39 .",
    "thus we obtain that @xmath40 , which shows that the observed luminosity ratio is strongly dependent on the lf ratio .",
    "since @xmath23 , this indicates that the observed specific flux ratio is @xmath41 .",
    "now we work on the calculation of the scattered flux on more detail . in order to determine the scattered flux from shell 2 we will first calculate the incident flux from shell 1 at the point of shell 2 that intersects the line of sight between the central engine and the observer",

    "what is the time delay , @xmath107 , between the arrival of these two photons ?",

    "in the shell 1 co - moving frame , a photon is emitted from shell 1 with frequency @xmath112 . in the laboratory frame , this frequency is measured as    @xmath113    where @xmath114 is the angle between the photon s direction and the @xmath115-axis direction of the shell 1 co - moving frame .",
    "note that the @xmath115-axis of frame @xmath116 is always directed to the moving direction of frame @xmath116 relative to another inertial frame ( @xmath117 or @xmath118 ) .",
    "since the photon is emitted to the observer ahead of shell 1 , @xmath119 , and the previous equation becomes    @xmath120    let us now consider a photon emitted in shell 1 and directed to shell 2 .",
    "the frequency of this photon in the shell 1 co - moving frame is @xmath112 , and in the shell 2 co - moving frame is given by @xmath121 .",

    "these quantities can be expressed in terms of quantities in the laboratory frame as    @xmath125    if we assume that @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 ) , in the co - moving frame of shell 2 it will seem that shell 1 is moving away from shell 2 ( moving towards shell 2 ) , so that @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) . using the last 3 equations , we can determine    @xmath130    which holds for both assumptions",
    ". the photon will be scattered by shell 2 by thomson scattering ( there will be no frequency change in the co - moving frame of shell 2 ) and then will travel towards the observer .",
    "the scattered frequency can be obtained with    @xmath131    setting @xmath132 , since the photon moves towards the observer , yields    @xmath133    finally , using equations ( 18)-(20 ) the ratio of the scattered frequency to the primary frequency is    @xmath134    using the fact that both shells travel close to the speed of light .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier simple estimation .",
    "therefore , a slower ( faster ) shell 2 will lower ( raise ) the frequency of the primary photons .      let us assume that shell 1 emits for a finite duration of time , @xmath135 ( in the lab frame ) .",
    "an observer located in front of the shell will detect that the radiation from shell 1 lasts for @xmath136 , given by @xmath137 .",
    "the radiation from shell 1 will also travel back to shell 2 and will get scattered , giving a scattered radiation duration of @xmath138 in the observer frame . if the first photon from shell 1 is emitted at time @xmath60 and the last one at @xmath139 ( in the lab frame ) , then we can use the time delay equation ( 17 ) to find the time delay between the first primary photon and the first scattered photon , and the time delay between the last primary photon and the last scattered photon , respectively . subtracting these two expressions ,",
    "we find that    @xmath140    which means that the observed duration of the scattered emission will be stretched ( shortened ) by a factor of @xmath141 for a slower ( faster ) shell 2 .",
    "we want to write equation ( 14 ) , the ratio of the fluxes , in such a way that we can easily use the available observations to test our theory .",
    "we can use equation ( 17 ) to solve for @xmath16 , the time delay between the ejection of the two shells .",
    "this expression is then substituted into equation ( 11 ) to get @xmath142 and into equation ( 16 ) to get the radius ratio .",
    "finally , we obtain the flux ratio in terms of the time delay divided by @xmath143 as follows :    @xmath144 ^ 2 \\biggr\\}^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath145 ^ 2 \\biggl ( \\frac{\\gamma_2}{\\gamma_1}\\biggr)^4.\\ ] ]    we then plot this ratio of two flux densities as a function of the @xmath143-normalized time delay ( the choice of this normalization will become evident on the next sections ) for various values of @xmath146 in figure 2 . for plotting purposes we assume @xmath147 and @xmath148 . since the exact value for @xmath37 is unknown ,",
    "we choose to scale @xmath37 into the y - axis of the figure , as an `` unit '' of the flux density ratio .",
    "looking at figure 2 , we can observe that the theoretical flux ratio curves have two regions ( this is very noticeable when @xmath149 ) .",
    "in region i the flux ratio is flat , and in region ii the flux ratio is proportional to the square of the inverse of the normalized time delay . if we inspect equation ( 23 ) , we can separate its two regions by :    @xmath150    @xmath151    these two regions will be used in our applications section . for",
    "now , they just provide a simpler theoretical model .",
    "notice that the @xmath152 curves are dominated by region ii , while the @xmath149 curves have a combination of both regions . for the latter ,",
    "the maximum scattered flux is given by region i.    these results show that the scattered flux from a slower shell is small , falls at a lower energy than the primary photon s energy and its total duration is larger than that of the primary emission .",
    "if we have a faster shell , then the scattered flux from it could be either larger or smaller than the primary flux , depending on its ejection time delay , @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 is larger ( smaller ) than the total observed duration of the primary emission , then the scattered emission would appear at late times ( would be part of the primary emission ) . in any case",
    ", the energy of the scattered photons would be larger than that of the primary ones , and the total duration of the scattered emission would be smaller than that of the primary emission , so that the scattered emission would appear as a short bright flash .      in the last sections we assumed _ thomson scattering _ , but we should also look at the possibility that shell 2 could be hot , so the scattering mechanism at work would be _ inverse compton_. shell 2 electrons could be hot in the following scenario . consider that shell 2 is ejected after shell 1 and undergoes particle heating , by either internal shocks or magnetic dissipation , at a radius smaller than the radius where shell 1 produces @xmath1-ray photons .",
    "shell 2 would experience adiabatic expansion and would cool , but the electrons could still be hot by the time that the @xmath1-ray photons from shell 1 reach them .",
    "the shell 2 electrons might also cool via radiation , but the chances still exist that the radiative cooling is very inefficient , for instance , when the radiation mechanism is synchrotron - self - inverse - compton instead of pure synchrotron for the same observed typical photon energy , so that the electron cooling time could be comparable to the delay between the electron heating and the scattering .",
    "the main difference in the formulas previously derived will be in the ratio of the frequencies of the primary and the scattered emission .",
    "equation ( 21 ) is modified to include the inverse compton boost to the photon energy : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the electrons thermal lorentz factor .",
    "the theoretical flux density ratio previously derived will not be changed in this new scenario .",
    "let us now calculate the isotropically equivalent total energy in the shell 2 hot electrons .",
    "for this , we need to calculate the isotropically equivalent total number of electrons in the shell from their optical depth    @xmath155    in the present scattering scenario , we have @xmath156 ( we ll prove this on section ",
    "@xmath25 can be estimated from the @xmath1-ray variability time scale : @xmath143 ( explained in detail on  7.1.1 ) .",
    "then the total energy in the hot electrons of shell 2 is given by    @xmath157    where @xmath158 is the speed of light .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      table 2 shows that the isotropically equivalent total energy carried by the electrons of a hot shell 2 is large , @xmath0 erg .",
    "if we take into account the cooling of the electrons via adiabatic expansion and/or radiation , the initial total energy when the electrons were just accelerated is even bigger . the optical depth , @xmath37 , would certainty decrease the total energy but only by a small fraction .",
    "the prompt emission from those electrons in shell 2 would arrive at about the same time as the scattered emission , and the two emission components would have similar durations because both durations are @xmath159 . depending on the ejecta properties , e.g. , the ratio of the shell 2 energy to the shell 1 energy , the shell 2 prompt emission might dominate the scattered emission in the light curve .",
    "if that is true , the shell 2 prompt emission might be a possible origin of the late x - ray flares in bursts for which both the flares and the shallower decay are present .",
    "in the previous section we assumed a slower shell 2 .",
    "what if shell 2 is faster than shell 1 ? based on the formulae we have , if @xmath152 , the scattered emission from @xmath1-rays would fall in higher energies , e.g. , @xmath160 mev , not in the x - rays , and have a shorter duration than the @xmath1-rays .",
    "it is shown in figure 2 that , in the @xmath152 cases , the scattered emission is very bright though it decreases with increasing time delay .",
    "if the scattered emission spectrum mimics the power law form of the primary emission spectrum , at some time delay significantly larger than the duration of the primary emission , the lower - energy - extrapolated scattered flux is close to or even brighter than the prompt @xmath1-rays . according to figure 2 , for @xmath161 ( corresponding to @xmath162 according to equation ( 21 ) ) and a selected observed time delay @xmath163 ( which corresponds to an ejection delay @xmath164s ) , @xmath165 f_{\\nu}(t_p)$ ] . extrapolating the scattered flux density from @xmath111 to @xmath9",

    "that means we should have seen a lagged very short @xmath1-ray flash at @xmath168 seconds after the burst , provided that @xmath169 .",
    "this case can not happen because the observations have never showed this feature . even though the flux of the scattered emission is smaller for a larger observed time delay , in order for",
    "the delayed scattered @xmath1-ray flash to indeed happen but below the bat flux limit , shell 2 must have an extremely large ejection time delay @xmath170 a few @xmath171 seconds ( cf .",
    "equation 17 ) which is very difficult to explain in terms of the central engine activity . for @xmath172",
    ", the @xmath152 case could have happened but the flux would be too small to be detected .",
    "one possible case of @xmath152 is that the shell 2 ejection delay @xmath16 is small and shell 2 has moved very close to shell 1 when the scattering happens so that the observed time delay of the scattered emission is comparable or smaller than the duration of the primary emission .",
    "the scattered emission in the bat energy range will become part of the observed prompt @xmath1-ray emissions in time .",
    "future high energy ( @xmath173 mev ) observations ( e.g. , by _ glast _ ) during the burst may be able to determine the existence of this case .",
    "in  7 , our calculations show that the scattered flux is much lower than the observed x - ray shallow decay flux .",
    "if the scattering indeed happens , then the resultant emission must have been buried in the shallow decay .",
    "thus , in order for the scattered emission to be detected , not only the shallow x - ray decay component must be absent , but also the normal external forward shock component must be extremely weak or absent .",
    "in rare cases swift does observe x - ray afterglows without a shallow decay and without the normal forward shock decay ( @xmath174 ) , which we call _ x - ray dim grbs_. they show instead a very steep flux decay ( @xmath175 ) and are thought to be located in extremely low density regions .",
    "the steep decay component can be explained by the large angle emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "grb 050421 and grb 051210 are two examples ( godet et al .",
    "2006 ; la parola et al .",
    "note that grb 051210 is of the short burst class which , according to its compact binary progenitor model , is more probable to occur in a low density environment . at late times , however , when the large angle emission is low enough , neither burst shows any sign of re - brightening atop the steep power - law decay .",
    "another case of interest is the existence of _ x - ray dark grbs _ : short bursts ( grb 050906 and grb 050925 ) that show no x - ray afterglow detection , only upper limits at @xmath176 100 s ( nakar 2007 ) .",
    "it is also believed that these bursts took place in extremely low density environments .",
    "x - ray dim and dark grbs provide a great opportunity to put into work the theory presented in this paper .",
    "if we assume that there is a late ejecta behind the @xmath1-ray producing source , then we can try to constrain its lf by looking at these bursts .",
    "since their afterglow emission is so weak ( or not present ) , we can ask the question : what are the constraints on the lf of the late ejecta , so that the scattered emission is present in x - ray dim and dark grbs , but does nt exceed the actual flux observations or upper limits ? we will devote this section to answer this question .",
    "we ll start by using the data from _ swift _ s bat and xrt observations as follows :    @xmath177    where we have selected @xmath9 = 100 kev , but we have made no assumption on the value of @xmath111 only that it should obey equation ( 21 ) .",
    "we have also assumed @xmath178 , which is consistent with _",
    "swift _ observations .    with the previous inequality and using the two previously defined regions of the flux ratio (  6 ) , we can find constraints on the lf ratio . in region",
    "i , we find :    @xmath179    and in region ii :    @xmath180    @xmath181    where we have used @xmath182 and the convention @xmath183 has been adopted .    after presenting these last two conditions",
    ", we should return to the physical picture .",
    "the initial assumption we made is that the scattered emission should be present independently of the burst s data and its region .",
    "this means that the lf of the late ejecta could be very small , so that its contribution to the flux would be also minuscule .",
    "therefore , we should discard the lower limit on equation ( 27 ) .",
    "now , we want to constrain the lf of the late ejecta from above ; we are interested in knowing what s its maximum",
    ". the maximum value between the two upper limits of equations ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) will be the best and more conservative value to choose :    @xmath184    now we are ready to consider the 4 bursts mentioned at the beginning of this section and obtain the constraints for the lf of the late ejecta .    using the last x - ray detection of grb 051210 ( la parola et al .",
    "2006 ) and the upper limit of grb 050421 ( godet et al .",
    "2006 ) , both at @xmath185 s , we can obtain the ratio between the xrt flux density at 1 kev ( scattered emission ) and the bat flux density ( chincarini et al . 2007 ) at 100 kev ( primary emission ) , @xmath186 . following the procedure outlined in  7.1.1",
    ", the values for @xmath187 are also obtained .",
    "we can do exactly the same for the _ x - ray dark short grbs _ , using the upper limits of grb 050906 and grb 050925 at @xmath176 100 s ( pagani et al . 2005 ; beardmore et al .",
    "2005 ; nakar 2007 ) . with @xmath186 and the normalized time delay",
    ", we find the following constraints :    @xmath188    the upper limits for the _ x - ray dark short grbs _ provide the best constraints , since the upper limits in their x - ray flux are very strict .",
    "these results imply that , for @xmath95 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the late ejecta is very slow @xmath189 , but it could be faster if @xmath37 decreases .",
    "we have investigated a scenario of photons scattering by electrons within a relativistic outflow .",
    "the outflow is composed of discrete shells .",
    "one front shell emits radiation , observed as the grb s prompt @xmath1-ray photons .",
    "some fraction of the radiation is incident backwards to the shell(s ) behind , and is scattered isotropically in the local rest frame .",
    "the scattered emission arrives at the observer at a later time , @xmath105 , and at a different photon energy , @xmath111 , that are determined by the lf ratio of the two shells and the time delay of the ejection of the second shell .",
    "we calculated the flux density ratio , i. e. , the flux density of the delayed scattered emission to that of the front shell s primary emission , as a function of the normalized arrival time delay and the assumed lf ratio .",
    "the calculated flux density ratio are compared with observations using a sample of _ swift _ grb x - ray afterglows which show a distinct shallower decay component in their light curves , with the motivation to see if the scattering scenario could be the origin of the shallower decay .",
    "the results are negative . for thomson scattering ,",
    "the flux density of the scattered emission is about @xmath190 times lower than that of the shallower decay component , where @xmath37 is the scattering shell s electron optical depth .",
    "we also consider the inverse compton scattering scenario in which the electrons in the scattering shell is hot .",
    "we find that , in order for the scattered emission flux to be bright enough to match the shallower decay component , the isotropic equivalent of the total energy carried by the hot electrons is large , @xmath0 erg .",
    "the prompt emission from the scattering shell appears at the same time as the scattered emission and with a similar duration .    in the cases where shell 2 is faster than shell 1 , when extrapolated to the bat energy band",
    ", the scattered flux can be as bright as the emission from shell 1 .",
    "the delay of the scattered emission is determined by the ejection delay of shell 2 .",
    "when the ejection delay of shell 2 is much larger than the duration of the primary emission , the scattered emission would appear as a late short @xmath1-ray / mev flash .",
    "for a small ejection delay of shell 2 , the scattered emission would become part of the observed prompt emission . the fact that no late short @xmath1-ray / mev flash is detected does not support the existence of a late faster shell .",
    "lastly , we study the possibility of detection of the scattering emission in two x - ray dim grbs - that only show a very steep flux decay and do not show either a x - ray shallow decay nor the normal forward shock component - and in two x - ray dark short grbs - that show no x - ray afterglow detection at @xmath160 100 s. assuming that there is slower moving ejecta material behind the fast @xmath1-ray producing shell in these bursts , we find upper limits for the lorentz factor of the late slower material . more sensitive observations of x - ray dark short grbs could provide stronger constraints on the presence and properties of slower moving material accompanying the fast @xmath1-ray jet in grbs .",
    "almost simultaneous to the appearance of this paper , panaitescu ( 2007 ) presents a similar work on the scattering of the grb early emission photons by a late outflow .",
    "both papers present the same physics and the main formulae are consistent .",
    "the main differences are that ( i ) we have considered the scattering within the relativistic outflow and the photons to be scattered are the prompt @xmath1-ray photons , whereas panaitescu ( 2007 ) considers the scattering of the afterglow forward shock photons by a late relativistic outflow , and ( ii ) panaitescu ( 2007 ) has considered a faster second shell to be able to explain features like the `` shallow decay '' and the x - ray flares , whereas our focus is mostly on a slower second shell .",

    "here we show that the integrand function in equation ( 6 ) for the incident flux from shell 1 on point @xmath42 in shell 2 comoving frame is insensitive to @xmath191 so that the integrand can be taken out of the integral as a constant . we will also show that the integrand is of order unity .",

    "also , from equation ( a-3 ) , express @xmath198 in terms of @xmath47 only : @xmath199 therefore , we can plot @xmath197 numerically as a function of @xmath198 .",
    "the only thing left is to calculate the upper limit of @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( a-2 ) gives @xmath200 denote @xmath201 , and apply it onto equation ( a-3 ) and square both sides of ( a-3 ) .",
    "then we get a quadratic equation of @xmath202 : @xmath203 with roots @xmath204 the second root ( @xmath205 ) can be ruled out , because when we put it back into equation ( a-3 ) , the second root gives @xmath206 , while equation ( a-2 ) requires @xmath207 .",
    "thus @xmath208 is the sole root of the upper limit of @xmath47 .",

    "for @xmath215 , @xmath197 is not always on order of unity .",
    "since shell 2 is moving toward shell 1 , the relativistic beaming effect is important ( panaitescu 2007 ) .",
    "when @xmath16 is very small , shell 2 is very close to shell 1 , so that @xmath77 is larger than @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the relative lf between two shells . in this case",
    "we find that at an angle @xmath218 , @xmath197 starts to drop very sharply from on order of unity to infinitely small , and that dropping - down angle is approximately equal to @xmath216 .",
