    "we present the results of a study of the weak gravitational lensing of light in four different cosmological models , using the algorithm for the three - dimensional shear developed by couchman , barber and thomas ( 1999 ) . since weak lensing effects depend on the angular diameter distances for the lenses and sources , and also the specific distribution and evolution of matter , the results are sensitive to the particular cosmological model .    in _ strong _ lensing studies , frequent use is made of the ` thin - screen approximation , ' in which the mass distribution of the lens is projected along the line of sight and replaced by a mass sheet with the appropriate surface density profile .",
    "deflections of the light from the source are then considered to take place only within the plane of the mass sheet , making computations for the light deflections simple .",
    "the simplicity of the thin - screen approximation has also lead to its frequent use in weak gravitational lensing studies , where each of the output volumes from cosmological @xmath0-body simulations is treated as a planar projection of the particle distribution within it .    however , a number of problems can arise with two - dimensional approaches , especially in weak lensing studies in which the large - scale distribution of matter extending to high redshifts is responsible for the lensing .",
    "couchman , barber and thomas ( 1999 ) considered some of the shortcomings and were motivated to develop an algorithm to compute the six independent components in three dimensions of the second derivative of the gravitational potential ( the three - dimensional shear ) . in the method used in the present work , for which the effects of lensing along lines of sight are required ,",
    "the two - dimensional ` effective lensing potentials ' ( see section 2 ) are obtained by integrating the computed three - dimensional shear components along the lines of sight .",
    "these effective lensing potentials are used to construct the jacobian matrices which are recursively generated along the lines of sight , and from the final jacobian matrices the magnifications and two - dimensional shear are determined .",
    "a brief outline of this paper is as follows .    in * section 1.2 * we summarise the previous weak gravitational lensing methods by other authors .    in * section 2 * , the essential equations for gravitational lensing are explained , and the multiple lens - plane theory is described , culminating in expressions for the magnification , convergence , two - dimensional shear , and ellipticity , which are the weak lensing outputs from the cosmological simulations .    *",
    "section 3.1 * summarises the three - dimensional shear algorithm , and particularly the choice of the variable softening scale for the particles .",
    "this feature limits the effects of isolated particles ( not representative of the large - scale structure ) , and builds in a physical significance both to the choice of the softening scale , and to the underlying form of the dark matter .",
    "we explain also how the softening carefully limits the incidence of strong lensing events in all the cosmologies . in * section 3.2 *",
    "we describe the four cosmological @xmath0-body simulations used in this work . in * section 3.3 *",
    "we state how the simulation boxes are oriented to minimise correlations in the large - scale structure between adjacent time - outputs , and we describe the establishment of lines of sight through the simulations , and the locations of the evaluation positions for the shear within them . in * section 3.4",
    "* we explain how the computed shear values are converted ( after integration along the lines of sight ) to physical units , and the approximations we have adopted in the method .    in * section 4.1",
    "* the dyer - roeder equation for the angular diameter distances is introduced and * section 4.2 * summarises the results derived in the appendix for the beam equation generalised for all the cosmologies .",
    "this precedes the discussion ( * section 4.3 * ) of magnifications obtainable in inhomogeneous universes with different degrees of smoothness , and highlights the significance of differences between researchers who adopt different approaches to this subject .",
    "* section 5 * formally presents the weak lensing results .",
    "we first ( * section 5.1 * ) attempt to see if the onset of structure formation can be seen from the shear data , and briefly comment on the expected behaviour of the developing shear .",
    "secondly ( * section 5.2 * ) , the results for magnification , convergence , shear and ellipticity are presented for all the cosmologies , compared and contrasted .",
    "we consider the impact of the smoothness parameter on the results .",
    "it may be possible to determine the density parameter , @xmath2 , from the probability distribution and the skewness in the distribution for the convergence , both of which may be measurable observationally . in * section 6.1 *",
    "we present our results for these quantities , and compare them with others .",
    "the application to the determination of the cosmological parameters from type ia supernov   is mentioned in * section 6.2*.    in * section 7 * the weak lensing statistics detailed in section 5 are summarised , together with the results of the non - gaussianity in the convergence .",
    "we also compare and contrast our results with other authors .",
    "of particular significance are the common use of two - dimensional approaches by others , and the use of either point mass particles or particles with small softening scales , which introduce high values of magnification .",
    "these authors often use the empty cone approximation , rather than the full beam approximation , making comparisons difficult .",
    "this latter point is discussed .    in the * appendix * we state the generalised beam equation , and derive the equations necessary for the numerical determination of the angular diameter distances for all the cosmologies .",
    "numerous methods have been employed to study weak lensing , and throughout this paper we will make comparisons with previous work by other authors .",
    "we summarise here the methods which have been used by others .",
    "jaroszyski et al .",
    "( 1990 ) use a ` ray - tracing ' method to evaluate the matter column density in a matrix of 128@xmath1 pixels for each of their lens - planes .",
    "the boxes were generated using a particle - mesh ( pm ) code in the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) cosmology , and were of side - dimension 128@xmath3mpc , where @xmath4 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 . by making use of the assumed periodicity in the particle distribution orthogonal to the line of sight , they translate the planes for each ray , so that it becomes centralised within the plane of one full period in extent .",
    "this removes any bias acting on the ray when the shear is computed . instead of calculating the effect of every particle on the rays ,",
    "the pixel column densities in the single period plane are used , and they assume that the matter in each of the pixels resides at the centre point of each pixel .",
    "they calculate the two two - dimensional components of the shear ( see section 2 for the definition of shear ) as ratios of the mean convergence of the beam , which they obtain from the mean column density .",
    "however , they have not employed the net zero mean density requirement in the planes , ( described in detail by couchman , barber and thomas , 1999 ) , which ensures that deflections and shear can only occur when there are departures from homogeneity . also , the matter in the pixel through which the ray is located is excluded . to follow the shearing across subsequent planes",
    "they recursively generate the developing jacobian matrix for each ray , in accordance with the multiple lens - plane theory ( see section 2 ) .",
    "wambsganss , cen and ostriker ( 1998 ) also use the ` ray - tracing ' method in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the method is applied to pm simulations of the scdm cosmology , in which a convolution method is used to combine large - scale boxes of 400@xmath3mpc and resolution 0.8@xmath3mpc , with small - scale boxes of 5@xmath3mpc and the higher resolution of 10@xmath3kpc .",
    "they randomly orient each simulation box , and project the matter contained within each onto a plane divided into pixels .",
    "they choose the central @xmath6mpc @xmath7mpc region through which to shoot rays , but account for the deflections of the rays in terms of all the matter in the plane of @xmath8mpc @xmath9mpc . however , to speed up the computation , a hierarchical tree code in two dimensions is used to collect together those lenses ( pixels ) far away , whilst treating nearby lenses individually .",
    "the code assumes that all the matter in a pixel is located at its centre of mass .",
    "the matter in each pixel , which measures @xmath10kpc @xmath11kpc , is assumed to be uniformly spread . by using the multiple lens - plane theory ,",
    "they show both the differential magnification probability distribution , and the integrated one for 100 different source positions at redshift @xmath12 . one advantage of this type of ray - tracing procedure is its ability to indicate the possibility of multiple imaging , where different rays in the image plane can be traced back to the same pixel in the source plane , and they are able to compute the statistics of angular separations for multiple images .",
    "marri and ferrara ( 1998 ) use lens - planes up to redshifts of @xmath13 for mass distributions determined by the press - schechter formalism , and treat the particles as point - like masses with no softening .",
    "they apply their ray - tracing method to three cosmologies with @xmath14 , ( 0.4 , 0.6 , 0 ) , and ( 0.7 , 0 , 0.3 ) .",
    "( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the density parameters for matter , vacuum energy and the hot dark matter component , respectively . )",
    "the maximum number of lenses in a single plane is approximately 600 , each having the appropriate computed mass value , and they follow @xmath18 uniformly distributed rays within a solid angle of @xmath19sr , corresponding to a @xmath20 field . the final impact parameters of the rays are collected in an orthogonal grid of @xmath21 pixels in the source plane . because of the use of point masses , their method produces very high magnification values , greater than 30 for the einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "they have also chosen to use a smoothness parameter @xmath22 in the redshift - angular diameter distance relation ( described in section 4 ) which depicts an entirely clumpy universe .",
    "jain , seljak and white ( 1998 , 1999 ) have made use of @xmath0-body simulations generated using a parallel adaptive particle - particle , particle - mesh ( ap@xmath1 m ) code .",
    "the cosmologies simulated are the same as the ones reported on here , but they have 256@xmath1 particles and comoving box side dimensions of 85@xmath3mpc for their einstein - de sitter cosmologies , and 141@xmath3mpc for the open and cosmological constant models . for each plane , the projected density , together with the appropriate redshift - dependent factors , is fourier transformed , using periodic boundary conditions , to obtain the shear in fourier space .",
    "the two - dimensional shear matrix is then computed onto a grid in real space by the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the size of the grid is chosen to be compatible with the force - softening scale ( the resolution ) in the @xmath0-body simulations , so that for sources at redshifts around 1 , the angular - scale size of the grid is less than , or of the same order as , the angular - scale size of the force - softening at these redshifts .",
    "perturbations on the photon trajectories are computed and the shear matrix interpolated to the photon positions enabling the jacobian matrices to be computed by recursion . in view of the use of a fine grid for the shear and deflection angle computations , they are able to analyse their data on different scales , and are thus able to determine the power spectrum in both the shear and the convergence .",
    "this approach is very different from the approach we follow which makes use of variable softening for the particles depending on their particular environment , and which ensures that most ` rays ' would pass entirely through regions of smoothed density , thereby requiring the application of the full beam approximation .",
    "jain , seljak and white ( 1998 , 1999 ) assume point particles interpolated onto their grid , and use the empty cone approximation .",
    "hamana , martel and futamase ( 1999 ) study weak lensing in @xmath0-body simulations of three cosmologies with ( @xmath23 ) = ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 0.3 , 0.7 ) , and ( 0.3 , 0 ) .",
    "( we now use @xmath2 and @xmath24 to represent the present matter density and vacuum energy density parameters respectively . )",
    "these were generated by a p@xmath1 m algorithm , using fourier techniques on a 128@xmath1 lattice .",
    "the comoving simulation box sizes were 128mpc , and the particles were given comoving softenings of 300kpc .",
    "three simulations were performed for each cosmological model , and boxes from the different simulations combined to limit correlations in large - scale structure between adjacent boxes .",
    "each of the mass distributions in the simulation boxes were than projected onto planes at the box redshift , and poisson s equation solved numerically on each of them .",
    "this was done by first evaluating the surface density onto a @xmath25 grid , based on the particle positions , and then inverting poisson s equation using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) method .",
    "as the multiple lens - plane theory was to be used for more than @xmath26 rays passing through each plane , the recursion algorithm was simplified by assuming small deflections for the rays .",
    "this also meant that the rays could be considered to pass through the grid points , and travel , effectively , in straight lines through the entire distance from the observer to the source plane .",
    "we have also made this approximation in our own method .",
    "an alternative to the conventional form of ` ray - tracing ' was introduced by refsdal ( 1970 ) , who used ` ray - tracing ' with calculations of the differential deflections of light rays around a central ray to determine the distribution of magnifications .",
    "fluke , webster and mortlock ( 1999 ) and fluke , webster and mortlock ( 2000 ) have developed this idea further as the ` ray - bundle ' method . the principle is to trace the passage of a discrete bundle of light rays as it passes through the deflection planes .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it provides a direct comparison between the shape and size of the bundle at the observer and at the source plane , so that the magnification , ellipticity and rotation can be determined straightforwardly .",
    "the authors have selected a range of popular cosmologies , including the ones reported on here , and have produced their own @xmath0-body simulation data - sets using a p@xmath1 m algorithm .",
    "for each cosmology they have produced a number of independent simulations to enable them to randomly choose a simulation box for a particular epoch from any of the realisations . in this way , correlations of large - scale structure between adjacent boxes are avoided .",
    "they have run their simulations with @xmath27 dark matter particles , with box sizes ranging from 80@xmath3mpc to 164.3@xmath3mpc .",
    "having randomly selected the boxes for a given cosmology , the particle mass distributions are then projected onto planes at the redshifts of the boxes .",
    "the authors construct approximately 50,000 bundles , each comprising 8 rays , to shoot in random directions through the planes , from the observer s location at @xmath28 .",
    "the shooting area was limited to @xmath29 to avoid edge effects of the planes , and only matter within a single period in the transverse direction is included in the planes .",
    "in addition , a radius , typically 15@xmath3mpc centred around each bundle is chosen for the extent of the matter to be included in the deflection angle computations .",
    "the projected masses are also considered as point particles , so that very high magnification values can be achieved in principle ; however , the authors do not include bundles which pass within @xmath30 of the einstein radius of any particle .",
    "because of their use of point masses , they use the empty cone approximation in the determination of the statistical distributions of magnifications for the different cosmological models .",
    "premadi , martel and matzner ( 1998a ) have introduced individual galaxies into the computational volume , matching the 2-point correlation function for galaxies .",
    "they also assign morphological types to the galaxies according to the individual environment , and apply a particular surface density profile for each .",
    "five different sets of initial conditions were used for the simulations , so that the individual plane projections can be selected at random from any set .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations were produced for three cosmologies with ( @xmath31 ) = ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 0.2 , 0 ) , and ( 0.2 , 0.8 ) in boxes of comoving side - dimension 128@xmath3mpc .",
    "they solve the two - dimensional poisson equation on a grid and invert the equation using a fft method to obtain the first and second derivatives of the gravitational potential on each plane .",
    "they also correctly ensure that the mean surface density in each lens - plane vanishes , so that a good interpretation of the effects of the background matter is made .",
    "their method uses beams of light , each comprising 65 rays arranged in two concentric rings of 32 rays each , plus a central ray .",
    "the multiple lens - plane theory then enables the distributions of cumulative magnifications to be obtained .",
    "tomita ( 1998a and b ) also uses a ray bundle method , but by evaluating the gravitational potential at approximately 3000 locations between the observer and sources at redshift 5 , he is able to compute the weak lensing statistics without using the multiple lens - plane theory .",
    "he has used @xmath0-body simulations produced using a tree code with @xmath32 particles in four different cosmologies with @xmath33 and ( 0.4 , 0 ) . in all of these , except the scdm cosmology ( @xmath34 ) , the particles are treated as galaxy - size objects . in the scdm cosmology , 20% of the particles are treated thus , whilst 80% are given softening radii of 100@xmath3kpc ( model a ) , 40@xmath3kpc ( model b ) , and 20@xmath3kpc ( model c ) .",
    "ray bundles are formed from @xmath35 rays arranged in a square , with separation angles ( fixed for each run ) at between 2 arcsec and 1 degree . at each of the 3000 positions between the observer and source ,",
    "the potential is evaluated at each ray position by translating each simulation cube ( using the periodic properties ) so that the centre of each bundle is located in the centre of each cube . in this way",
    ", all the matter within a full period in extent contributes to the calculation of the potential ( although no account is taken of matter beyond one period transverse to the line of sight ) . to avoid spurious values of the potential arising from masses close to evaluation positions , an average of the potential",
    "is taken by integrating it analytically over the interval between adjacent evaluation positions . the light propagation",
    "is then determined by solving the null - geodesic equations , and the required statistics constructed from shooting 1000 bundles through the flat cosmologies , and 200 bundles through the open cosmologies .",
    "in the case of multiple deflections of light by a series of projected lens - planes , the jacobian matrix develops in accordance with the multiple lens - plane theory , which has been summarised by schneider , ehlers and falco ( 1992 ) .",
    "its form at redshift @xmath28 enables all the lensed properties of light from distant sources to be determined .",
    "we follow , in outline , their description . for a system of @xmath0 lenses ,",
    "the basic lens equation for a single lens , relating the angular position of the source to that of the image , may be generalised straightforwardly .",
    "if the position vector of the source in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight at the source position ( the source plane ) is @xmath36 , and the position vectors of the image positions in the various , @xmath0 , deflection planes are @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , then the lens equation may be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angular diameter distance to the @xmath41th lens , @xmath42 is that from the @xmath41th lens to the source , and @xmath43 is the deflection angle at the @xmath41th lens .",
    "to make equation  [ eta ] dimensionless , put @xmath44 and for the source , @xmath45 we also use the individual reduced deflection angles defined by @xmath46 then the displacement in the @xmath47th lens plane is @xmath48 or @xmath49 where @xmath50 then the full form of the ray - tracing equation is equation  [ xj2 ] evaluated at the source plane : @xmath51 ( the @xmath52 factor disappears , because @xmath53 from its definition . ) the mapping of the source onto the image is given by the jacobian matrix , which relates small changes in the source to corresponding small changes in the image seen on the first lens - plane : @xmath54 similarly , we may define jacobian matrices appropriately at each of the lens - planes : @xmath55 we now define the derivative of the reduced deflection angle for the @xmath41th lens by @xmath56 by defining the ` effective lensing potential ' in terms of the angular position , @xmath57 for the @xmath41th lens as an integral along the line of sight direction , @xmath58 , @xmath59 in which @xmath60 is the velocity of light , @xmath61 can be shown to be equivalent to the matrix of the second derivatives of the effective lensing potential for the @xmath41th lens , and is therefore related to the second derivative of the gravitational potential ( the shear ) : @xmath62 where the superscripts , @xmath41 , denote the deflection plane index , and where we have written @xmath63 @xmath64 in which the suffixes in the denominators refer to the coordinate directions .",
    "then the ray - tracing equation ( [ raytracing ] ) gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the identity matrix .",
    "thus the final jacobian matrix can be evaluated at @xmath67 , since the individual matrices can be obtained by recursion . using equation  [ xj2 ] , they are just @xmath68 for the @xmath47th lens , and @xmath69    in our approach , the second derivatives of the two - dimensional effective lensing potentials required for each deflection location , are obtained by integration of the computed three - dimensional shear values , i.e. , the second derivatives of the _ peculiar _ gravitational potential .",
    "it is necessary to work with the peculiar gravitational potential , because the shearing of light arises from deviations from homogeneity ; in a pure robertson - walker universe we would expect no deviations .",
    "couchman , barber and thomas ( 1999 ) derive the expression for the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath70 , in terms of the gravitational potential , @xmath71 , and the mean density , @xmath72 : @xmath73 @xmath74 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath75 is the position vector , and @xmath76 is the expansion factor for the universe ( so that @xmath77 is the comoving position vector ) .",
    "this result corresponds to a system with zero net mass on large scales and immediately gives @xmath78 and @xmath79 equation  [ 10 ] shows how the real result for the shear , @xmath80 , based on the peculiar gravitational potential , is related to the value of @xmath81 through the subtraction of the term in the mean density .",
    "equation  [ 10 ] can now be evaluated explicitly for the three - dimensional shear .",

    "the integration is along the coordinate direction , @xmath58 , and the subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath47 now refer to any of the three coordinate directions .",
    "this equation applies quite generally for any deflection location , so the deflection plane index has been dropped for clarity .",

    ", the evaluation of the second derivatives of the two - dimensional effective lensing potentials is obtained from integration of the computed three - dimensional shear values at a large number of evaluation positions along lines of sight . the multiple lens - plane theory",
    "then enables distributions of the magnification , ellipticity , convergence and shear at redshift @xmath67 to be computed for light rays traversing the set of linked simulation boxes starting from the chosen source redshift . the ability to apply the appropriate angular diameter distances at every evaluation position avoids the introduction of errors associated with planar methods , and also allows the possibility of choosing source positions within a simulation box if necessary .",
    "couchman et al . ( 1998 ) describe in detail the algorithm for the computation of the elements of the matrix of second derivatives of the gravitational potential .",
    "the algorithm is based on the standard p@xmath1 m method ( see hockney and eastwood , 1988 ) , and uses a fast fourier transform convolution method .",
    "it computes all of the six independent shear component values at each of a large number of selected evaluation positions within a three - dimensional @xmath0-body particle simulation box .",
    "it has a computational cost of order @xmath101 , where @xmath0 is the number of particles in the simulation volume , and for ensembles of particles , used in typical @xmath0-body simulations , the rms errors in the computed shear component values are typically @xmath102 in addition , the shear algorithm has the following features .    *",
    "a ) *   the algorithm uses variable softening designed to distribute the mass of each particle within a radial profile depending on its specific environment . by virtue of this facility ,",
    "we have been able to choose the softening such that light rays feel the existence of a smooth mass distribution .",
    "each particle may be assigned its own softening - scale parameter , depending on the particle number - density in its environment . in this way",
    ", it can be used to minimise the effects of isolated single particles , whilst the smoothed denser regions are able to represent the form of the large - scale structure .",
    "the parameter we have chosen to delineate the softening scale for each particle is proportional to @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the radial distance to the particle s 32nd nearest neighbour .",
    "the value of @xmath105 has been evaluated for every particle by using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) density program for each simulation box , and is read in by the shear code along with the particle position coordinates .",
    "the maximum softening is allowed to be of the order of the mesh dimension for isolated particles , which is defined by the regular grid laid down to decompose the short- and long - range force calculations . in this way individual isolated particles are unable to strongly influence the computed shear values , in accordance with our need to study the broad properties of the large - scale structure , rather than the effects of individual particles , which are not representative of physical objects .",
    "to determine realistic values for the minimum softening scale , we wanted to keep the incidence of strong lensing to a minimum , whilst at the same time allowing a physical interpretation . using the dimensionless angular diameter distances in terms of the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , for the observer to the lens , the lens to the source , and the observer to the source , respectively",
    ", the einstein radius , @xmath113 , becomes @xmath114 for a cluster of @xmath0 particles , each of mass @xmath115 solar masses ( see section 3.2 ) , where @xmath4 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "substituting values for the angular diameter distance factors then gives a maximum value of @xmath116 mpc for a source at redshift @xmath117 in the scdm cosmology .",
    "this occurs for a lens at redshift @xmath118 .",
    "thus , for a cluster of 1000 particles , @xmath119 mpc . for a source at redshift 3.6 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath113 is @xmath120 mpc and occurs for a lens at redshift 0.53 .",
    "thus by setting a working minimum value for the variable softening of @xmath121 mpc , we would rarely expect to see strong lensing due to caustics in the simulations . in box units ,",
    "the softening is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the box redshift .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath113 in the other cosmologies , for @xmath124 , are as follows .    for @xmath125 , @xmath126 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath113 is @xmath127 mpc for @xmath117 , and occurs for @xmath128 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath113 is @xmath130 mpc , and occurs for @xmath131 .    for @xmath125 , @xmath132 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath113 is @xmath133 mpc for @xmath117 , and occurs for @xmath134 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath113 is @xmath135 mpc , and occurs for @xmath136 .",
    "consequently , we are able to ensure that the incidence of strong lensing is kept to very low levels in all cosmologies , and that the minimum softening is always greater than , or similar to , the maximum value of the einstein radius for a cluster of 1000 particles . at the same time",
    ", the softening scale is approximately of galactic dimensions , giving a realistic interpretation to the choice .",
    "we have also accounted for the effects of the different numbers of particles per box in the different cosmological simulations .",
    "the variable softening scale for each particle has been retained at the same level in all the cosmologies , so that the same mass value is contained within it .",
    "thus , around small - particle clusters there would be differences in the softening from cosmology to cosmology , but around large clusters , where the shearing is likely to be most important , the differences would be tiny .",
    "couchman et al .",

    "it has been shown ( couchman et al . , 1998 ) that in specific circumstances , the results of two - dimensional planar approaches are equivalent to three - dimensional values integrated throughout the depth of a simulation box , provided the angular diameter distance is assumed constant throughout the depth . however , by ignoring the variation in the angular diameter distances throughout the box , errors up to a maximum of 9% can be reached at a redshift of @xmath137 for scdm simulation cubes of comoving side 100@xmath3mpc .",

    "* c ) *   the shear algorithm automatically includes the contributions of the periodic images of the fundamental volume , essentially creating a realisation extending to infinity .",
    "couchman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that it is necessary to include the effects of matter well beyond the fundamental volume in general ( but depending on the particular particle distribution ) , to achieve accurate values for the shear .",
    "methods which make use of only the matter within the fundamental volume may suffer from inadequate convergence to the limiting values .",
    "* d ) *   the method uses the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath70 , through the subtraction of a term depending upon the mean density .",
    "such an approach is equivalent to requiring that the net total mass in the system be set to zero , and ensures that we deal only with light ray deflections arising from departures from homogeneity .",
    "the three - dimensional shear code can be applied to any three - dimensional distribution of point masses confined within a cubic volume , and produces shear values as if the fundamental volume were repeated indefinitely to represent a three - dimensional periodic distribution of masses .",
    "each particle may be assigned an individual mass , although in the tests and our application of the code , all the particles were assumed to be dark matter particles with the same mass .",
    "the code has been applied to the data bank of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations provided by the hydra consortium ( http://hydra.mcmaster.ca/hydra/index.html ) and produced using the ` hydra ' @xmath0-body hydrodynamics code ( couchman , thomas and pearce , 1995 ) .",
    "simulations from four different cosmologies were used , which will be referred to as the scdm , tcdm , ocdm and lcdm cosmologies .",
    "each of the simulations used a cold dark matter - like spectrum , and the parameters used in the generation and specification of these cosmological simulations are listed in table  [ cosmo ] .",
    ".parameters used in the generation of the four different cosmological simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the distributions in the shear , @xmath93 , ( defined according to equation  [ gammadef ] ) are broadest , as expected , for the highest source redshifts , and , as before , the lcdm cosmology displays the broadest distribution for @xmath93 for sources at high redshift .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath98 , in the image of a source is primarily produced by the shear , and we show in figure  [ epsdistz4c ] the probability distributions for @xmath98 for @xmath138 for all the cosmologies . figure  [ epsaccz4c ] shows the accumulating number of lines of sight for which the ellipticity is greater than the abscissa value , again for @xmath139 and for all the cosmologies .",
    "figures  [ epsdistz1c ] and  [ epsaccz1c ] show the same information for @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath140    @xmath141    @xmath142    @xmath143    for @xmath139 , the peaks in the ellipticity distributions occur at @xmath144 ( scdm ) , 0.057 ( tcdm ) , 0.081 ( ocdm ) , and 0.111 ( lcdm ) . for @xmath117 ,",
    "the corresponding figures are @xmath145 ( scdm ) , 0.027 ( tcdm ) , 0.021 ( ocdm ) , and 0.033 ( lcdm ) .",
    "once again , we see that the lcdm cosmology produces the greatest variation and the highest values for the highest redshifts , although this is not the case at lower redshifts .",
    "the ellipticity is very closely linear in terms of @xmath93 throughout most of the range in @xmath93 , for all the cosmologies .",
    "some scatter occurs because of the factor containing the convergence , @xmath91 , in equation  [ epssim ] .",
    "finally , the distance - redshift relation , equation  [ d1 ] , implies that there may be an effect on the angular diameter distances from the shear .",
    "barber et al .",
    "( 1999 ) investigated this for the scdm cosmology , and found that whilst the maximum effects of shear on the mean magnification values may be at least 10% , only 3.2% of the lines of sight were affected in this way .",
    "also , they pointed out that the shear has an effect in the distance - redshift relation equivalent to increasing the effective smoothness parameter , @xmath146 , and this is true for all the cosmologies . by substituting the mean shear value ( from the scdm cosmology ) determined for sources at @xmath147 ( where the term in @xmath148 in equation  [ d1 ] is largest ) , they found the effect on @xmath146 ( and therefore on the angular diameter distances ) to be completely negligible .",
    "furthermore , the importance of the effect reduces with redshift , so that our decision to ignore the effects of shear in the distance - redshift relation is justified .",
    "jain and seljak ( 1997 ) have given careful consideration to the interpretation of observed shear data ( from measured galaxy ellipticities ) by comparing with the analytical results of second order perturbation theory .",
    "they claim that non - linear evolution leads to non - gaussian effects in the weak lensing statistics which are more easily detected in second , and higher order , moments .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution for the three - dimensional density contrast , @xmath149 is almost indistinguishable in the different cosmologies , whereas the probability distribution function for the convergence , @xmath91 , shows different peak amplitudes and different dispersions in the different cosmologies .",
    "this is because the transition to non - linearity in the evolution of structure depends primarily on the density contrast alone , but the weak lensing signal is strongest in those cosmologies which have developed structure at optimum redshifts for given source positions , and therefore depends more directly on the rate of evolution .",
    "specifically , the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum introduces non - gaussianity to the weak lensing statistics , whilst the matter density parameter , @xmath2 , ( and to some degree the vacuum energy density parameter , @xmath24 ) determines the dispersion in the statistics .",
    "jain and seljak ( 1997 ) have computed the expected skewness , @xmath150 , in the convergence , @xmath151 where @xmath148 represents the standard deviation in the distribution for @xmath91 .",
    "as expected , the skewness was greatest on small angular scales , and largest for sources at the lowest redshifts .",
    "in general , the lcdm cosmology produced the greatest skewness , followed by the ocdm , and finally the scdm cosmologies , for sources at low redshift . even though they have assumed an empty beam scenario with @xmath152 , and correspondingly different angular diameter distances from our work , our own results for the skewness in @xmath91 are quite consistent with theirs .",
    "we have computed the skewness , not on different angular scales , but as a function of redshift for the different cosmologies .",
    "it is not possible to state a specific angular scale for our data , because of the variable softening approach in the shear algorithm .",
    "figure  [ skew1 ] confirms that , at redshifts less than about 1.5 , the lcdm cosmology gives rise to the largest skewness , followed by the ocdm cosmology , and finally , the scdm and tcdm cosmologies .",
    "the difference between the scdm and tcdm cosmologies does suggest different forms of structure , which result directly from the input shape parameter , @xmath153 , in the power spectrum . in broad terms , it is clear that the skewness decreases with source redshift , and decreases with the density parameter , precisely as expected from perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath154    bernardeau , van waerbeke and mellier ( 1997 ) also use perturbation theory ( and the empty beam approach ) to assess how the low order moments in the convergence may depend on the cosmological parameters .",
    "a number of results are predicted .",
    "they define the moment , @xmath155 , ( _ not _ the skewness , defined above ) by @xmath156 and predict that @xmath157 for @xmath158 , or @xmath159 for @xmath160 , and they predict a slightly weaker dependence on @xmath2 for @xmath161 .",
    "we do not find these exact relationships because working in the full beam approximation with variable smoothing alters the predictions .",
    "however , we do find that the value of this statistic does decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "our results for @xmath155 are displayed in figure  [ skew2 ] .",
    "bernardeau , van waerbeke and mellier ( 1997 ) predict significantly less dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath162    jain , seljak and white ( 1999 ) have used ray - tracing in @xmath0-body simulations , as described in the introduction , in an attempt to evaluate the density parameter from weak lensing statistics .",
    "since they make use of the empty beam approximation , they describe the possibility of many more lines of sight passing through voids from @xmath117 in open universes , because of the earlier beginning to structure formation .",
    "they suggest that this means that the probability distribution for @xmath91 in open universes will have its peak close to the minimum value .",
    "higher density universes will have the peak well away from the minimum , so that the shape of the distribution will be less steep .",
    "moreover , they state that this situation only applies on small scales , and on such scales this points to the minimum value of @xmath91 being roughly proportional to @xmath2 . a better statistic in the empty beam approximation would be that @xmath163 . however , they admit that the result ` does depend somewhat on the geometry , as the pathlength and angular scale differ between open and cosmological constant models with the same @xmath164 ' more specifically , this result will depend crucially on the approximation used , i.e. , the empty or full beam approximation , and the procedure for particle smoothing .",
    "they find that the measured minimum for @xmath91 in the open cosmology is close to the predicted value , but that in the critical , @xmath165 , cosmology the value was far from the empty beam value because there were actually no completely empty lines of sight .",
    "our full beam approach will of course represent the extreme case .",
    "it is therefore reassuring to see that both our @xmath166 ( figure  [ skew3 ] ) and @xmath167 ( figure  [ skew4 ] ) values for the different cosmologies are in the order expected from the values of @xmath2 .",
    "however , because of the entirely different approach from that of jain , seljak and white ( 1999 ) , the results are not able to indicate specific values for @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath168    @xmath169    jain , seljak and white ( 1999 ) also find for the @xmath155 statistic that @xmath170",
    "@xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath171 @xmath173 @xmath171 @xmath174 at low redshift",
    ". this concurs with our findings ( see figure  [ skew2 ] ) .",
    "they quantify the difference between the scdm and tcdm cosmologies in terms of a weak function of the shape parameter , which occurs in the expression for @xmath155 from perturbation theory .",
    "they have also explained in some detail how observational data may be used to reconstruct the convergence , which is only feasible with large fields where the weak shear signal is measurable .",
    "however , in view of our quite different approaches , which clearly give rise to discrepancies ( although only in terms of degree ) , care must be taken when interpreting observational data in this way . if we had a better understanding of the form , distribution and evolution of the dark and luminous matter in the universe , it might be possible to produce simulations and weak lensing experiments in more realistic scenarios .",
    "we have seen in section 5 the significant ranges in magnifications ( dependent on the cosmology ) which might apply to distant sources . in the absence of magnification ( or demagnification ) from the large scale structure , it would be possible to determine the cosmological parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath24 , from the departures from linearity in the hubble diagram , provided ` standard candle ' sources together with good calibration were available for measurement at high redshift .",
    "this is precisely the route taken by a number of authors , most importantly riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) , both of whom have used high - redshift type ia supernov  data of redshifts up to 0.97 .",
    "it is evident from our results that full account must be taken of the ranges in magnification for each of the cosmologies , and in particular the cosmologies suggested by the high - redshift type ia supernov  results .",
    "both groups of workers , i.e. , riess et al . ( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) , point to cosmologies which are close to the @xmath175 @xmath132 cosmological simulation we have analysed in terms of weak lensing .",
    "consequently , our results from this cosmology are of considerable interest for their impact on the determination of the cosmological parameters . using the data we report here , barber ( 2000 )",
    "finds that true underlying cosmologies having a deceleration parameter @xmath176 may be interpreted as having @xmath177 , from the use of perfect standard candles ( without intrinsic dispersion ) , arising purely from the effects of weak lensing .",
    "this significant dispersion in @xmath178 ( approximately @xmath179 ) is somewhat larger than that found by wambsganss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on a cosmology with @xmath180 @xmath181 , because of our broader magnification distribution at @xmath182 .",
    "in the application of the code for the three - dimensional shear , we have had to consider what appropriate angular diameter distance values should be applied to the data .",
    "the values have all been calculated numerically from the generalised beam equations ( see section 4 ) for the different cosmologies .",
    "this was done in each case for a smoothness parameter @xmath183 .",
    "our variable softening scheme for the particles ensures that nearly all rays pass entirely through softened mass , and in addition , we found that the minimum value of @xmath184 was at least 0.8 ( at @xmath28 ) in all the cosmologies .",
    "the differences in the magnification distributions for @xmath185 and for the minimum value were almost indistinguishable .",
    "the effects of shear on the angular diameter distances ( through changes to the effective value of the smoothness parameter , @xmath146 ) , were found to be completely negligible at all redshifts , so we are justified in ignoring them in the distance - redshift relation .",
    "furthermore , they are always additive , making the effective value of @xmath184 even closer to unity",
    ".    we found , in section 5.1 , that the einstein - de sitter universes showed the most rapid growth in the ` intrinsic ' shear components at late times , as expected from the growth of structure in these cosmologies .",
    "this was as a result of studying the computed shear values before the application of the angular diameter distance factors , and before conversion to physical units .",
    "the ocdm and lcdm cosmologies indicated only a limited contribution from the cosmological constant in terms of the growth in the shear values , again consistent with the expected evolution of structure in these cosmologies .    when the computed shear values were multiplied by the full conversion factors appropriate to the integration , together with the angular diameter distance factors , the resulting curves exhibited very broad peaks , indicating that significant lensing may result from structure in a wide band of redshifts .",
    "significantly , the lcdm cosmology has both the broadest and the highest peak , indicating that this cosmology should produce , for example , the broadest range of magnifications .",
    "this result would appear to come primarily from the large values of the angular diameter distance factors for this cosmology , rather than any considerations about the evolution of structure .",
    "however , the broader and higher peak for the scdm cosmology , compared with the tcdm cosmology , does indicate the differences in structure within them , since they both have the same values for the angular diameter multiplying factor , @xmath186 .    in section 5.2",
    ", we showed the results for the magnification distributions for the different cosmologies for different source redshifts , and these are concisely summarised in table  [ mu4c ] . at high redshift",
    ", the lcdm cosmology produces the highest magnifications , the broadest distribution curves , and the lowest peak values . for sources at @xmath187 in the lcdm cosmology , 97% of all lines of sight have magnification values up to 1.850 .",
    "( the maximum magnifications , not quoted here , depend on the choice of the minimum softening in the code , although the overall distributions are very insensitive to the softening . ) the rms fluctuations in the magnification ( about the mean ) were as much as 0.191 in this cosmology , for sources at @xmath187 . even for sources at @xmath147",
    "there is a measurable range of magnifications in all the cosmologies .",
    "the immediate implication of these results is the likely existence of a bias in observed magnitudes of distant objects , and a likely dispersion for standard candles ( for example , type ia supernov ) at high redshift .",
    "the magnification versus the convergence showed the presence of significant shear , and the mean values of @xmath93 in small convergence bins pointed to a possible slow linear increase in @xmath188 with @xmath91 .",
    "this would result in a trend towards higher mean magnification values ( as @xmath91 increases ) than would be the case for constant @xmath188 .",
    "the distributions for the shear , @xmath93 , are broadest , in the lcdm cosmology for high source redshifts , and there are closely linear relationships between the ellipticity and the shear in all the cosmologies .",
    "this relationship leads again to broad distributions in the ellipticity for high - redshift sources in the lcdm cosmology .",
    "the peak in the ellipticity distribution for the lcdm cosmology , for @xmath129 , is 0.111 , being almost twice the value in the tcdm cosmology .",
    "jain , seljak and white ( 1999 ) have expressed the possibility of determining the value of the density parameter from the convergence field from weak lensing statistics .",
    "they show one - point distribution functions for @xmath91 , assuming sources at @xmath117 , for all their four cosmologies and using different ( fixed ) smoothing scales in each .",
    "they describe the increasing non - gaussianity of the distribution functions as the smoothing scale is reduced , and the increasing tail at high @xmath91 .",
    "they also describe the shape of the distribution functions for negative @xmath91 , which results from the rate of structure formation in the different cosmologies , and claim the interesting conclusion that the minimum value of @xmath91 is proportional to the density parameter . we were able to establish from our own work that , in broad terms , the skewness in @xmath91 decreases with source redshift , and decreases with increasing density parameter , as expected .",
    "also , the statistic @xmath155 ( defined in equation  [ s3 ] ) was found to decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "however , we were unable to establish more precise relationships , because of the use of the full beam approximation .",
    "the order of the cosmologies for @xmath155 is the same as that presented by jain , seljak and white ( 1999 ) .",
    "we also found that both @xmath166 and @xmath167 are in the correct order for the different cosmologies in terms of @xmath2 , although , again for the same reason , it would not be possible to obtain specific values for @xmath2 .",
    "we now , very briefly , make some comparisons with the weak lensing results obtained by other authors",
    ". this will not be exhaustive , because it has been anticipated that our results should be different , for a number of reasons .",
    "primary amongst these are the following .",
    "first , our results were obtained using the three - dimensional shear code , which allows periodicity , the use of the peculiar potential , the net zero mean density requirement , and angular diameter distances to every evaluation position within each simulation volume .",
    "second , many two - dimensional ( planar ) approaches may suffer from inadequate convergence to the true limiting values for the shear matrix and angular deflections .",
    "third , we have introduced a physically realistic variable softening to the method , which requires use of the full beam approximation for the angular diameter distances , rather than the empty cone approximation used by many authors with either point masses , small ( fixed ) softenings , or small pixellation in the planes .",
    "the magnification distributions of jaroszyski et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for the scdm cosmology do not have mean values of 1 , and their dispersions in the convergence for sources at @xmath189 and @xmath190 are considerably lower than our values , with very little evolution with redshift . in our work",
    ", the peaks of the ellipticity distributions occured at values of 0.075 ( similar to the value for @xmath138 ) and 0.034 for sources at @xmath191 and 1 respectively , and these are somewhat lower than the values of 0.095 ( @xmath190 ) and 0.045 ( @xmath189 ) found by jaroszyski et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . rather surprisingly , however , their peak values in the distributions for the shear are quite similar to ours , especially for sources at @xmath190 .",
    "wambsganss , cen and ostriker ( 1998 ) find magnifications up to 100 in the scdm cosmology , and correspondingly highly dispersed distributions , very much larger than ours for @xmath190 .",
    "the high magnification tail in the distributions almost certainly derives from the low value of the ( fixed ) softening scale resulting from the ` smearing ' of the mass distribution in the @xmath10kpc @xmath192kpc pixels .",
    "similarly , marri and ferrara ( 1998 ) show wide magnification distributions , and very high maximum values , again which occur as a result of using point particles rather than smoothed particles .",
    "their procedure ( summarised in section 1.2 ) is completely different from ours , and , unlike us , they find that the scdm cosmology has the broadest magnification probability distribution , followed by the lcdm cosmology , and finally their hcdm cosmology",
    ". in particular , we would disagree with their choice of @xmath193 , which is representative of an entirely clumpy universe , as opposed to our finding , that the scdm universe is close to being smooth at all epochs .",
    "hamana , martel and futamase ( 1999 ) find that the dispersions in the probability distributions for @xmath91 , @xmath93 and @xmath89 are all greatest for the einstein - de sitter cosmology , and are very similar for their open and cosmological constant cosmologies .",
    "this is in complete contrast to our findings .",
    "their magnification and convergence distributions for @xmath194 2 and 3 are much broader than ours , although the distributions for @xmath93 in the scdm cosmology are similar .",
    "the ranges in magnification from premadi , martel and matzner ( 1998a ) appear to be rather similar to ours for sources at @xmath190 for their three cosmologies , and the widths of the distributions are in the same order for the different cosmologies that we find .",
    "this is reassuring because , although their method relies on two - dimensional projections of the simulation boxes , they include many of the essential features to which we have drawn attention , for example , an assumed periodicity in the matter distribution , randomly chosen initial conditions to avoid structure correlations between adjacent simulation boxes , the net zero mean density requirement , realistic mass profiles for the particles , and use of the filled beam approximation with a smoothness parameter , @xmath195 .",
    "they show the average shear for a source at @xmath196 contributed by each of the lens - planes individually , and find that the largest contributions come from those planes at intermediate redshift , of order @xmath123=1  2 .",
    "similarly , they find that the lens - planes which contribute most to the average magnifications are also located at intermediate redshifts . in terms of the development of structure in the different cosmologies , they find that the lens - planes contributing the most shear and magnification are located at larger redshifts for those cosmologies with smaller @xmath15 .",
    "the average shear for each redshift has been plotted by the authors .",
    "they find , for all redshifts , that the values in the scdm cosmology are many times greater than in the lcdm cosmology , which is , in turn , greater than in the ocdm cosmology .",
    "this is not what we find .",
    "fluke , webster and mortlock ( 2000 ) , in applying the ray bundle method of fluke , webster and mortlock ( 1999 ) , explain clearly the differences between the empty cone and full beam approximations .",
    "they use the empty cone approximation , because of their use of an effective fixed physical radius for each particle , equal to @xmath197 the einstein radius for each .",
    "this gives rise to magnification probability distributions with @xmath198 , arising from the use of @xmath199 , and high magnification tails , arising from the small effective radii for particles and clusters .",
    "they obtain the weak lensing statistics for the same cosmologies we have used . for @xmath200 ,",
    "the distribution in the magnifications for the scdm cosmology is clearly broader than that for the lcdm cosmology , which in turn is broader than the ocdm cosmology .",
    "this is also true of our data , although the order for the cosmologies , in our work , is completely altered for higher source redshifts .",
    "the authors find , as do we , that the most significant differences amongst the cosmologies arise directly as a result of the optical depth to the source , which is related to the angular diameter distances .",
    "moreover , there is a suggestion in their results ( fluke , 1999 ) that kolmogorov - smirnov tests may be unable to distinguish the cosmologies , _ even random distributions of particles , _ in terms of their magnification distributions , if the same set of angular diameter distance factors is applied to each .",
    "this last statement may prove to be extremely important , as it appears from both our own work and that of fluke , webster and mortlock ( 2000 ) , that the angular diameter distances ( or optical depths ) are really the determining factor for weak lensing statistics .",
    "moreover , our two approaches may represent ` limits ' for the true lensing behaviour from the mass distribution in the universe .",
    "the variable softening facility within our algorithm leads naturally to the assumption that the universe may be described in terms of the full beam approximation .",
    "this is , however , quite different from the assumptions of most other workers , who frequently use point particles , or a limited form of fixed softening , or small pixellation , and therefore use the empty beam approximation .",
    "the two approaches give rise to quite different expectations and results .",
    "the most obvious differences are the following .",
    "first , strong lensing can occur with effectively small particles , leading to high magnification tails in the probability distributions .",
    "second , magnification distributions in the empty cone approximation all have @xmath201 , whilst in the full beam approximation , @xmath202 ; this may alter the dispersions in the two distributions .",
    "third , the mean values for the magnifications can be calculated from the respective angular diameter distances in the different cosmologies for the empty beam approximation ; however , the mean values in the full beam approximation are always 1 .",
    "these points make comparisons between methods using the different approximations difficult .",
    "however , it is probable that the universe is neither completely smooth nor filled with galactic - mass point - like objects .",
    "( subramanian , cen and ostriker , 1999 , highlight our uncertainty in this area , by suggesting that small dense masses formed early during hierarchical clustering may persist to late times , so that real cluster halo structures may depend crucially on the detailed dynamics of the dense pockets . )",
    "the resolution of this question together with a better understanding of the form , distribution and evolution of the dark and luminous matter content of the universe should provide a much clearer indication of the likely weak lensing statistics in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations of the future .",

    "in section 4 , we presented the most simple form for the dyer - roeder equation ( equation  [ dr ] ) , which can be solved analytically for @xmath165 , @xmath126 , and arbitrary @xmath184 .",
    "the general solution for the angular diameter distance between redshifts of @xmath203 and @xmath204 , in such a cosmology , is well documented ( see , e.g. , schneider et al . , 1992 ) and from this solution the multiplying factors @xmath205 are easily obtained .",
    "however , this solution applies only to cosmologies with zero cosmological constant .",
    "we therefore generalised the form of the dyer - roeder equation to apply to the cosmologies being studied in this work .",
    "the following summary of this work is likely to be helpful to others working in this field .",
    "we started from the generalised beam equation , quoted by linder ( 1998a and b ) : @xmath206(1+z)^{-1}\\frac{dd}{dz}+\\frac{3}{2}(1+z)^{-2}d\\sum_s(1+s)\\bar{\\alpha}_s(z)\\omega_s(z ) = 0 .",

    "to which we have restricted our work , @xmath211 for dust and @xmath212 for the vacuum energy .",
    "when @xmath211 only , equation  [ genbeam ] reduces to the dyer - roeder equation immediately .",
    "also , with two components only , the equation for the deceleration parameter at the present day , reduces from equation  [ q0 ] to the familiar form , @xmath213 , where now we have used @xmath214 and @xmath215 to represent the matter and vacuum energy density parameters respectively .",
    "also , the hubble parameter is , in general , @xmath216(1+z)^2\\right\\}^{1/2}. \\label{hz}\\ ] ] for a two - component universe this becomes : @xmath217(1+z)^2\\right\\}^{1/2}. \\label{hz2}\\ ] ]    for two components only , the generalised beam equation ( equation  [ genbeam ] ) is : @xmath206(1+z)^{-1}\\frac{dd}{dz}+\\frac{3}{2}(1+z)^{-2}d\\bar{\\alpha}(z)\\omega(z ) = 0 , \\label{genbeam2}\\ ] ] in which @xmath218}{\\omega(0)z+\\lambda(0)(1+z)^{-2}-\\lambda(0)+1 } , \\label{qz2}\\ ] ] @xmath219^{-2 } , \\label{omegaz2}\\ ] ] @xmath220(1+z)^2\\right\\}^{1/2 } , \\label{hzh0}\\ ] ] and so @xmath221(1+z)^2\\right\\}^{-1}. \\label{omegaz22}\\ ] ] to solve equation  [ genbeam2 ] , boundary conditions @xmath222 and @xmath223^{-1 } \\label{bdy2}\\ ] ] are set , where the second condition is made by considering the form of the hubble law for a fictitious observer at the redshift @xmath203 .",
    "however , we need values for the angular diameter distances between any arbitrary redshift values ( not always based on @xmath67 ) in order to construct values for @xmath205 at all the required evaluation positions . to do this , equation  [ genbeam2 ] has to be generalised further to apply to any arbitrary redshift , and we can do this by changing the variable to @xmath224 @xmath225 then corresponds to the redshift of an object as if viewed by an observer at the arbitrary redshift @xmath203 .",
    "then substituting the expression for @xmath226 ( equation  [ qz2 ] ) , equation  [ genbeam2 ] becomes , after some manipulation , @xmath227}{\\omega(0)(x-1)+\\lambda(0)x^{-2}-\\lambda(0)+1}\\right\\}\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{dd}{dw}(1+z_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hskip 1.0 in + \\frac{3}{2}d\\bar{\\alpha}\\left\\{\\frac{\\omega(0)x}{\\omega(0)x^3+\\lambda(0)-\\left[\\omega(0)+\\lambda(0)-1\\right]x^2}\\right\\ } = 0 , \\label{13new}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with boundary conditions , @xmath228 and @xmath229(1+z_1)^2\\right\\}^{-1/2}. \\label{bdy22}\\ ] ] ( in equation  [ 13new ] we have written @xmath230 for clarity . )",
    "we have solved this equation numerically for all the cosmologies , checking carefully that the results are the same as the analytical values for the einstien - de sitter model . to solve it , we made further definitions to simplify the form of the equation .",
    "first , for clarity , we directly interchanged @xmath225 and @xmath123 , and made the following definitions .",
