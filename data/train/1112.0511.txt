    "<S> the aim of the compass hadron programme is to study the light - quark hadron spectrum , and in particular , to search for evidence of hybrids and glueballs . </S>",
    "<S> compass is a fixed - target experiment at the cern sps and features a two - stage spectrometer with high momentum resolution , large acceptance , particle identification and calorimetry . </S>",
    "<S> a short pilot run in 2004 resulted in the observation of a spin - exotic state with @xmath0 consistent with the debated @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , coulomb production at low momentum transfer data provide a test of chiral perturbation theory . during 2008 and 2009 , a world leading data set was collected with hadron beam which is currently being analysed . </S>",
    "<S> the large statistics allows for a thorough decomposition of the data into partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> the compass hadron data span over a broad range of channels and shed light on several different aspects of qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of hadron physics is a fundamental understanding of all bound and resonant systems which interact via the strong force . at short distances , </S>",
    "<S> perturbation theory can be applied and its predictions have been rigorously and successfully tested . at longer distances , </S>",
    "<S> the self - coupling of the gluons makes perturbation theory inapplicable and effective field theories such as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) , or advanced computational tools like lattice qcd , have to be used instead . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that the key to understand qcd at low and intermediate momentum transfers lies in the hadron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the conventional quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) and quark triplet ( @xmath4 ) states within the simple contituent quark model , qcd also allows for hadronic matter with excited gluonic degrees of freedom , provided they are colour neutral . </S>",
    "<S> a _ glueball _ is a state described entirely in terms of gluonic fields with no constituent quarks , whereas a _ hybrid _ is a meson with a constituent gluonic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the excited glue in a hybrid contributes to its quantum numbers , which enables states with quantum numbers @xmath5 which are forbidden for simple @xmath3 pairs to be formed . such states are called _ spin - exotics_. lattice calculations predict a spin - exotic hybrid with mass within 1 - 2 @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some promising candidates have been found in experiments : the @xmath7 seen by bnl , ves and chrystal barrel @xcite , the @xmath1 reported by bnl and ves @xcite and the @xmath8 observed by bnl @xcite , but the resonance character of these states is disputed to this day . </S>",
    "<S> one goal of the compass hadron programme is to bring clarity into this issue .    </S>",
    "<S> the compass ( commom muon and proton apparatus for structure and spectroscopy ) spectrometer is located at the m2 beam line from the sps accelerator at cern . </S>",
    "<S> the physics studied by the muon programme is presented elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic features of the spectrometer are described in ref . @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the specifics of the hadron programme will be outlined in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the data for the hadron programme were collected during 2008/09 at the m2 beam line at the sps at cern . </S>",
    "<S> the negative hadron beam consisted of 96.8% @xmath9 and 2.4% @xmath10 , whereas the positive consisted of 74.6% @xmath11 , 24.0% @xmath12 and 1.4% @xmath13 , all with momentum 190 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the beam particles were identified by differential cerenkov detectors ( cedars ) located upstream of the target . the major part of the hadron data were collected using a 40 cm long liquid hydrogen target , but there were also runs with various thin nuclear target discs such as lead , nickel and tungsten . </S>",
    "<S> the target was surrounded by a recoil proton detector ( rpd ) where the recoil target proton was detected . </S>",
    "<S> the forward going particles were detected in the two - stage magnetic spectrometer providing precise tracking , rich particle identification and calorimetry . </S>",
    "<S> the layout of the compass spectrometer is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectro ] .        at the compass beam energy , 190 gev / c , </S>",
    "<S> three production mechanisms are accessible . in _ diffractive dissociation _ , reggeon exchange between the target and the beam hadron excites the beam to an intermediate state @xmath14 , which then decays . </S>",
    "<S> this is a likely production mechanism for spin exotic hybrids , provided they exist . in _ </S>",
    "<S> central production _ , double reggeon exchange form a state @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> double pomeron exchange is a special case of this process and provides a glue - rich environment which should be suitable for glueball production . in _ </S>",
    "<S> coulomb production _ </S>",
    "<S> , the target radiates a photon which excites the beam hadron . </S>",
    "<S> this process is important at low momentum transfer and is a testing ground for @xmath2pt .    </S>",
    "<S> interesting physics results from the compass hadron programme were obtained already from the three - day pilot run in 2004 , using a 190 @xmath15 @xmath9 beam impinging on a lead target . in the analysis , presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , diffractive dissociation of the beam pion into an intermediate state @xmath16 was considered , where @xmath16 decays subsequently into a @xmath17 final state . </S>",
    "<S> the selected momentum transfer range was @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleons in the lead nucleus act as quasi - free particles . </S>",
    "<S> the data sample comprised @xmath21 events . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum numbers of @xmath16 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the spin @xmath22 , parity @xmath23 , c - parity @xmath24 , spin projection @xmath25 and reflectivity @xmath26 , were disentangled by partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) . </S>",
    "<S> compass uses two independent programs for this task , one developed at illinois , jinr dubna and ihep protvino @xcite , and one at brookhaven @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been adapted for compass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis was performed in two steps : fit in bins of the three - pion invariant mass @xmath27 , followed by a mass - dependent fit ( for details , see @xcite ) . a spin exotic @xmath28 wave </S>",
    "<S> was observed , consistent with the disputed @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary mass - independent pwa of @xmath2925% of the available the 2008/09 data set , collected using a hydrogen target and comprising 23 million @xmath17 events , confirms the enhancement in the intensity around @xmath30 and the phase motion with respect to the @xmath31 resonance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mass - dependent fitting , background studies of e.g. the deck effect @xcite and leakage studies are ongoing for more definite conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking observation in the @xmath17 data is that the intensity of waves with a given spin projection @xmath25 , depends on the target material . </S>",
    "<S> data collected with lead target in 2009 were compared to hydrogen target data from 2008/09 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that for hydrogen , the @xmath32 states , including the exotic @xmath33 , are suppressed with respect to lead data , whereas @xmath34 are more populated in hydrogen , giving a sum of the @xmath25 substates which remains unchanged @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the two electromagnetic calorimeters allow for studies of neutral final states . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the @xmath35 final state , which provides an important consistency check of the results in the @xmath17 channel . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary pwa s , where the @xmath17 and the @xmath35 final states are compared , show good agreement between the observed wave intensities and the predictions using isospin- and bose symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another channel with neutral particles in the final state is the @xmath36 with @xmath37 decaying into @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the first pwa of these data show a strong @xmath39 wave , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiral ] where also the intensity of the @xmath40 wave and their phase difference are given . </S>",
    "<S> however , further studies are needed in order to draw conclusions about the resonance interpretation of the @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compass can also confirm the decay of @xmath41 into @xmath36 observed by bnl @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to tag beam kaons with the cedars in combination with the rich identification of final state kaons makes compass an excellent tool for studying kaon diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> recent results from the ongoing pwa of the @xmath42 final state @xcite show a spectrum of states which is mostly in agreement with previous results from the accmor collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> channels with kaons in the final state , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 , are also being studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compass can provide about an order of magnitude more events and a cleaner sample than previous measurement by bnl . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up possibilities to study _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g _ the @xmath44 system for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of pion production in @xmath45 , a subprocess of @xmath46 , at low momentum transfer @xmath47 has been measured using data from 2004 @xcite , and the preliminary results , shown to the right in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chiral ] , are in agreement with leading order @xmath2pt predictions @xcite .    data collected with the proton beam have been used to measure the ratio between the cross sections of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a test at high energy of the okubo - iizuka - zweig ( ozi ) rule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary result violates the prediction from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by a factor of @xmath293 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the proton beam data are also being used to study baryon spectroscopy @xcite and central production @xcite .    to summarise , the compass hadron programme provides excellent opportunities to study different aspects of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> a rich variety of channels are being studied , we can provide more than ten times the world statistics and interesting results have started to emerge .     </S>",
