    "the seminal work by dunlap and kenkre  @xcite has led to the recognition that an external uniform ac force can control the spreading of the wave packet of a particle moving in a spatially periodic potential .",
    "in particular , an initially localized wave packet of a monochromatically driven particle on a nearest - neighbor tight - binding lattice remains perpetually localized for certain values of the driving amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , termed `` dynamic localization '' , is a quantum mechanical manifestation of the fact that a time - periodic force sometimes can stabilize a system , as shown in classical mechanics by the example of the driven , inverted pendulum  @xcite .",
    "dynamic localization is closely related to the coherent destruction of tunneling experienced by a single particle in a double - well potential under the influence of an ac force  @xcite , and to the modification of atomic @xmath0-factors in oscillating magnetic fields  @xcite . in view of possible applications to electrons in terahertz - driven semiconductor superlattices , it has been shown theoretically that dynamic localization survives in the presence of coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , experiments with such devices are difficult to perform , and have to cope with a host of competing effects  @xcite .",
    "while there exist clean visualizations of dynamic localization in optical analogs of driven quantum systems , realized by means of curved waveguide arrays for light  @xcite , the observation of dynamic localization of matter waves has long remained a challenge .",
    "the situation changed with the availability of ultracold atoms in optical potentials . in 1998",
    "_ obtained evidence for band narrowing with cold sodium atoms in a phase - modulated optical lattice , in good agreement with theoretical calculations going beyond both the tight - binding and the single - band approximation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the basic mechanism responsible for dynamic localization , an effective rescaling of the hopping matrix element induced by the ac force , has been observed for single - particle tunneling in strongly driven double - well potentials  @xcite .",
    "it had also been pointed out that this mechanism remains effective even for an interacting bose - einstein condensate , at least for sufficiently high driving frequencies  @xcite .",
    "this has led to the experimental demonstration of dynamic control of matter - wave tunneling in an optical lattice  @xcite , and to the observation of photon - assisted tunneling of a condensate  @xcite .",
    "since the reduction of interwell tunneling increases the relative importance of the particles repulsion , even the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice can be induced by shaking the lattice in a time - periodic manner , as has now been shown by zenesini _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we take up this line of investigation and explore dynamic localization of a dilute bose - einstein condensate in a time - periodically shifted optical lattice in more detail .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s_2 ] we cast the concept of single - particle dynamic localization into a form that lends itself in a particularly transparent manner to further generalizations , relying on the idea of quasienergy bands  @xcite .",
    "we then apply these general considerations in sec .",
    "[ s_3 ] to optical cosine lattices , taking into account all couplings that are omitted in the nearest - neighbor approximation . in sec .",
    "[ s_4 ] we report our experimental results , achieved with condensates of  @xmath1rb .",
    "besides sinusoidal forcing , we also consider the case of square - wave forcing , which is known to produce exact single - particle dynamic localization for any form of the energy dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the final sec .",
    "[ s_5 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes a single particle with mass  @xmath4 moving in a one - dimensional periodic potential @xmath5 with lattice constant  @xmath6 , and @xmath7 introduces an external force @xmath8 , mediated by the position operator  @xmath9 in a manner analogous to electromagnetic forces on atoms within the dipole approximation .",
    "the energy eigenfunctions @xmath10 of @xmath11 are bloch states with band index @xmath12 and wave number @xmath13 , @xmath14 with functions @xmath15 sharing the spatial lattice period  @xmath6 .",
    "the solutions to the eigenvalue equation @xmath16 provide the dispersion relations @xmath17 for the various energy bands .",
    "it is of interest to observe that the external forcing does not truly break translational symmetry : introducing the unitary transfomation @xmath18 the transformed wave functions @xmath19 are governed by the hamiltonian @xmath20 which still remains invariant under spatial translations by  @xmath6 .    in the following ,",
    "we assume band gaps so wide that , despite the external force , the dynamics can be restricted to the lowest band . dropping the band index ,",
    "we expand the bloch waves of that band with respect to the corresponding wannier states  @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a wannier function centered around the @xmath23-th lattice site .",
    "we take the potential to be symmetric , @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 can be chosen real and symmetric  @xcite . defining the time - dependent wave number @xmath26 obeying @xmath27 and containing a still unspecified lower integration bound  @xmath28 , the wave functions @xmath29",
    "then are `` weak '' solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the full hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , in the following sense : by construction , one has @xmath30 if we stipulate that the lattice site labeled @xmath31 is situated at @xmath32 , implying @xmath33 then one has @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dirac ket corresponding to @xmath36 . note that this is an identity , which holds exactly even for shallow lattices .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath37 for each  @xmath23 .",
    "the above wave functions  ( [ eq : hou ] ) can be regarded as houston states  @xcite , also known as `` accelerated bloch states '' , and apply to any type of uniform forcing  @xmath8 , provided the single - band approximation remains viable .",
    "if we now require that the forcing be periodic with period  @xmath38 and zero average , so that @xmath39 and @xmath40 a further step can be made : in this case the transformed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htr ] ) is periodic in both space and time , thus giving rise to spatio - temporal bloch waves @xmath41 with quasimomenta @xmath42 , quasienergies @xmath43 , and time - dependent bloch functions obeying @xmath44 .    when deriving these states within the single - band approximation from the houston states  ( [ eq : hou ] )",
    ", a slight subtlety comes into play : the lower integration bound  @xmath28 in the definition  ( [ eq : wnq ] ) of @xmath45 effectuates a shift of the wave number  @xmath13 . in order to avoid this shift , and thus to make sure that the wave number  @xmath13 labeling a spatio - temporal bloch wave is the same as the one which labels the bloch state continuously connected to it when the driving force vanishes , this lower bound @xmath28 has to be chosen such that the integrated force also has zero average , requiring @xmath46 with this specification of @xmath45 , we set @xmath47 and write the houston states  ( [ eq : hou ] ) in the form @xmath48 this formal - looking manipulation is of key significance : after the average phase growth has been factored out , the remaining functions @xmath49 acquire the temporal periodicity of the force , @xmath50 thus , these wave functions  ( [ eq : flo ] ) are floquet states  @xcite , from which the spatio - temporal bloch waves  ( [ eq : stb ] ) are obtained by applying the unitary transformation  ( [ eq : utr ] ) . at times @xmath51 ( with integer  @xmath52 ) they coincide with the bloch waves  ( [ eq : blw ] ) , apart from a phase factor . _",
    "any _ single - band wave packet @xmath53 can be expanded with respect to these basis states , @xmath54 with some density @xmath55 which is time - independent despite the presence of the ac force .",
    "the @xmath38-periodic nature of the functions @xmath49 directly reflects the short - term response of such a packet to the force  @xmath8 , whereas the quasienergy dispersion @xmath43 governs its long - time averaged evolution in the same manner as the original energy dispersion @xmath56 governs its evolution when @xmath57 . for example , the average velocity @xmath58 of a wave packet initially centered around some wave number  @xmath59 is given , in the presence of the forcing , by @xmath60 moreover , the representation  ( [ eq : wap ] ) directly leads to a quite general and intuitive condition for dynamic localization : exact dynamic localization obviously occurs when the quasienergy band collapses , so that all quasienergies coincide , @xmath61 for all @xmath13 , implying that the effective mass of a driven bloch particle becomes infinite .",
    "all floquet states comprising the wave packet  ( [ eq : wap ] ) then acquire exactly the same phase in the course of one driving period , since @xmath62 so that the packet can neither move ( apart from its residual @xmath38-periodic motion ) nor spread , but simply reproduces itself @xmath38-periodically , regardless of the form of the density @xmath55 .",
    "when this condition of zero width of the quasienergy band can not be met exactly , but there still is significant band narrowing , wave packet spreading can at least be reduced substantially by the external force  @xcite .",
    "for a lattice with inversion symmetry , the original energy dispersion takes the form @xmath63 with coefficients given by matrix elements of @xmath11 between wannier states located @xmath23  sites apart from each other .",
    "in particular , for an optical cosine lattice of the form  @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the wave number of the lattice - generating laser radiation and the depth @xmath66 is proportional to the intensity of that radiation  @xcite , the wannier states can easily be computed numerically  @xcite .",
    "table  [ t_1 ] lists the resulting coupling coefficients @xmath67 for the lowest band as functions of the scaled lattice depth @xmath68 , with @xmath69 denoting the single - photon recoil energy of an atom with mass  @xmath4 .",
    "the relative error committed when adopting the commonly used nearest - neighbor approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , when neglecting all @xmath67 with @xmath70 , is on the order of 10% for an optical lattice with @xmath71 , and reduces to 1% only when @xmath72  @xcite .    .hopping matrix elements @xmath73 for the lowest band of an optical cosine lattice  ( [ eq : ola ] ) , as functions of the scaled lattice depth @xmath74 .",
    "observe that the sign of @xmath75 alternates with @xmath23 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now consider purely sinusoidal forcing , as specified by @xmath76 with some arbitrary phase  @xmath77 . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wnq ] ) together with the requirement  ( [ eq : req ] ) yields @xmath78 implying @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a bessel function of order zero , and we have introduced the scaled driving amplitude @xmath81 hence , the quasienergy dispersion resulting from the bloch band  ( [ eq : dis ] ) under sinusoidal forcing reads @xmath82 for the particular example of quasienergy bands originating from the lowest bloch band of an optical lattice  ( [ eq : ola ] ) , characterized by the matrix elements collected in table  [ t_1 ] , the quasienergy band widths are depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_1 ] as functions of @xmath83 for some typical depths  @xmath66 . due to the dominance of the nearest - neighbor hopping matrix element",
    "@xmath84 there is strong band narrowing for values of @xmath83 close to the zeros of the bessel function @xmath85 , but the nonvanishing longer - range hopping elements prevent the band from collapsing completely , as emphasized by the inset . thus , one expects appreciable , but incomplete dynamic localization in sinusoidally driven shallow optical lattices .      for square - wave forcing of the form @xmath86 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wnq ] ) and  ( [ eq : req ] ) yield @xmath87 to be continued @xmath38-periodically to all  @xmath88 .",
    "this gives @xmath89 with @xmath83 being defined according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sda ] ) , having set @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we write @xmath91 . correspondingly , the quasienergy dispersion becomes @xmath92 since all @xmath93-functions adopt their zeros simultaneously , there is a total collapse of this quasienergy band when @xmath94 with integer @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we recover the known fact that there is exact dynamic localization , regardless of both the values of the hopping matrix elements and the form of the wave packet , for these particular driving amplitudes  @xcite . figure  [ f_2 ] shows the widths of quasienergy bands originating from the lowest bloch band of an optical lattice under square - wave forcing ; the total band collapse at @xmath96 is clearly visible in the inset .",
    "our experimental setup is described in detail in ref .",
    "briefly , we adiabatically load bose - einstein condensates consisting of about @xmath97 atoms of @xmath1rb into the lowest band of a one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the lattice is generated by focusing two counter - propagating linearly polarized laser beams of wavelength @xmath98  nm onto the condensate , resulting in the periodic potential  ( [ eq : ola ] ) along the beam direction .",
    "each beam passes through an acousto - optic modulator , allowing us to introduce a frequency difference @xmath99 between the beams that can be used to accelerate or shake the lattice . in the laboratory frame of reference ,",
    "the condensate then experiences a time - dependent potential @xmath100\\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] by means of a unitary transformation to the comoving frame of reference , the single - particle hamiltonian is brought into the form @xmath101 hence , prescribing an oscillating frequency difference @xmath102 with amplitude @xmath103 , one obtains sinusoidal forcing with strength @xmath104 , amounting to the scaled driving amplitude @xmath105 on the other hand , the triangular protocol @xmath106 results in square - wave forcing with strength @xmath107 , giving @xmath108    we first study the _ in situ _ expansion of a condensate under both kinds of forcing  @xcite . to this end , initially an anisotropic , elongated harmonic trap with trapping frequencies of 20  hz ( longitudinally ) and 80  hz ( radially ) was superimposed on the lattice . after switching off the laser beam effectuating the longitudinal confinement ,",
    "the condensate was free to expand in the direction of the shaken lattice .",
    "after some time , it was illuminated by a resonant flash , the shadow cast by which was imaged onto a ccd chip",
    ".    we work with lattices possessing a fairly large depth between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , so that the effect of longer - range hopping is not discernible at the scale of our experimental accuracy , and we may employ the nearest - neighbor approximation , keeping only the hopping matrix element @xmath111 connecting adjacent lattice sites .",
    "thus , the unperturbed energy band is well described by the cosine dispersion relation @xmath112 assuming that interparticle interactions remain negligible .",
    "accordingly , the quasienergy band of the driven system is approximated by @xmath113 where the effective hopping matrix element @xmath114 is gven by @xmath115 for sinusoidal forcing , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : esn ] ) , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : esw ] ) gives @xmath116 for a square - wave drive .",
    "the measured expansion rate @xmath117 of the condensate width @xmath118 along the lattice direction is then to a good approximation proportional to the hopping element @xmath114 which effectively describes nearest - neighbor tunneling when the forcing is present  @xcite .",
    "this is a working example of our general philosophy : the time - averaged evolution of the driven system proceeds in close analogy to that of an undriven one , with @xmath43 replacing @xmath56 . in practice , rather than extracting @xmath114 from the expansion data , for each experiment we also measure the bare expansion rate ( which is proportional to @xmath119 ) in the undriven system , from which the normalized effective hopping element @xmath120 is then calculated .    in fig .  [ f_3 ]",
    "we plot our results for both types of forcing versus the scaled driving amplitude  @xmath83 , obtained with a sinusoidal drive of frequency @xmath121 , and a square - wave one with @xmath122 .",
    "evidently , the single - particle expectations are matched quite well , with the data obtained for square - wave driving scattering a bit more strongly around the prediction  ( [ eq : jsw ] ) than those for sinusoidal driving around the graph of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jsn ] ) .",
    "an alternative method for determining the points of maximum band collapse is to measure the phase coherence of the condensate in the shaken lattice  @xcite .",
    "switching off the confining potential and letting the condensate fall under gravity for 20  ms , we obtain an interference pattern whose visibility reflects the condensate coherence . recording this visibility as a function of time ,",
    "we extract the decay time constant @xmath123 of the resulting near - exponential function . in general , we find dephasing times on the order of 100  ms in the presence of even strong sinusoidal driving , while they are somewhat shorter for the square - wave drive , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_4 ] . in the immediate vicinity of the band collapse points , however , the dephasing times are strongly reduced : when the quasienergy band width approaches zero , the individual lattice sites are effectively decoupled , so that the local phases evolve independently due to interatomic collisions , resulting in a rapid dephasing of the array .",
    "this effect leads to sharply pronounced dips in plots of @xmath123 vs.  @xmath83 , allowing us to confirm the theoretically predicted first collapse points to fairly good accuracy : @xmath124 for sinusoidal forcing , whereas @xmath125 for the square - wave drive .    while in the present work we are mainly concerned with identifying the conditions for partial or complete dynamic localization , useful insight can also be obtained by studying the time evolution of the width of the driven matter - wave packet away from the collapse points . in general ,",
    "if the extension @xmath118 of a floquet wave packet  ( [ eq : wap ] ) narrowly centered in @xmath13-space around some @xmath59 is given by @xmath126 at time @xmath127 , that wave packet spreads in time according to @xmath128 with asymptotic , large-@xmath88 expansion rate @xmath129 determined by the second derivative of the quasienergy dispersion at @xmath59 .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : esn ] ) and ( [ eq : esw ] ) , here the hopping elements @xmath67 enter with weights proportional to  @xmath130 , each depending in a different manner on the driving amplitude . hence",
    ", precise measurements of the expansion rate could yield information both on the state of the driven packet , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the wave number @xmath59 , and on the next - to - nearest neighbor couplings . furthermore , while we have worked with condensate densities so low that interparticle interactions can be ignored and the single - particle picture remains applicable , it would be interesting to identify signatures of interparticle interactions in dynamic localization .",
    "in this work we have pointed out that wave packet motion and spreading in time - periodically forced spatially periodic potentials are governed by quasienergy bands @xmath43 in a manner which exactly parallels the description of quantum dynamics in unforced lattices in terms of their energy bands @xmath56 , and have experimentally demonstrated dynamic localization , _",
    "i.e. _ , `` freezing '' of the dynamics due to a quasienergy band collapse , with dilute bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices subjected to either sinusoidal or square - wave driving .",
    "seen from a conceptual viewpoint , this experimental confirmation of the ideas developed in the context of dynamic localization can be regarded as a proof of principle for the notion of _ quasienergy band engineering _ : different types of forcing , applied to the same energy band , can lead to substantially different quasienergy dispersion relations , and hence can be employed for realizing band structures which even might not have an analog in traditional solid - state systems .    in order to make contact with previous theoretical works  @xcite",
    ", we have restricted our investigation here to forces with parameters which do not lead to significant coupling of several energy bands . in this case",
    "the construction of the quasienergy dispersion merely involves taking the average  ( [ eq : eps ] ) and thus is an easy exercise , since one is essentially dealing with just a free bloch particle .",
    "however , such quasienergy bands , reflecting the existence of spatio - temporal bloch waves  ( [ eq : stb ] ) , originate from nothing more than the simultaneous presence of a spatially periodic potential and a temporally periodic force .",
    "accordingly , they also exist when several unperturbed energy bands are coupled by the force ; the quasienergy bands then exhibit fairly nontrivial features  @xcite .",
    "the exploration of these further options for band engineering which result from deliberate interband coupling , together with the inclusion of interparticle interaction , should open up further interesting avenues .",
