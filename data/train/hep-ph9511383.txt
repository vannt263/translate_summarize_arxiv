    "the behavior of field theories , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in particular , at finite temperature ( @xmath0 ) is of great phenomenological and theoretical interest . in general",
    ", we can roughly classify finite temperature physics into two categories : real - time dynamics and screening phenomena . on one hand , real - time dynamics describes the time - dependent response of a system ( correlators as functions of real frequency ) to time - dependent external probes .",
    "on the other hand , screening phenomena refer to the static spatial - dependent response ( correlators as functions of the spatial momentum ) to time - independent external probes .    without doubts ,",
    "real - time dynamics is highly interesting and important , and it could apply , in principle , to a wide range of phenomenological applications . unfortunately , its complexity and the present lack of systematic nonperturbative approaches make real - time dynamics at finite temperature a territory of field theory that is still , to a very large extent , barely cultivated  @xcite . in addition , the difficulties of realizing an equilibrated experiment with a given temperature , at least in the specific case of qcd , has practically prevented us from accessing real - time data that are not tempered by some _",
    "ad hoc _ phenomenological assumptions .",
    "in contrast , the euclidean nature of the static correlation functions makes the physics associated with screening phenomena relatively simpler .",
    "in fact , static correlation functions are determined from equilibrium ensembles and involve no tricky analytic continuation  @xcite and , therefore , screening physics is well - suited to the lattice formulation of field theories at finite temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "lattice qcd at finite temperature provides us with a large body of measurements not only of bulk quantities , such as the specific heat and pressure , but also of more detailed observables ranging from screening masses  @xcite to screening wave functions  @xcite .    in the past few years",
    "several physical pictures or scenarios have been proposed for properly understanding and interpreting the available lattice data , both the data involving observables made from pure gluonic fields  @xcite and the data involving observables made from explicit quark fields  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important concepts used in these works is the so - called dimensional reduction ( dr ) at high temperatures : this concept can be roughly summarized by saying that these qcd screening observables can be effectively described by a three - dimensional theory when temperature is high enough .",
    "the dr picture is based on the observation  @xcite that two different scales appear , in general , in field theories at high  @xmath0 : one scale is order @xmath0 and the other is order one relative to @xmath0 ( this second scale is strictly order one , i.e. independent of @xmath0 , only at the tree - level in general ) . at high @xmath0",
    "these two scales become vastly separated and certain degrees of freedom effectively decouple ; this phenomenon is analogous to the decoupling of heavy particles  @xcite .",
    "so far the existing literature  @xcite has mostly concentrated on situations where the observables involved are purely bosonic : the zero matsubara modes ( scale of order one ) are the explicit light degrees of freedom , while the non - zero modes ( scale of order @xmath0 ) play the role of the heavy degrees of freedom .    however , we are often interested in observables that couple directly to quark degrees of freedom , observables that would vanish without the explicit presence of quarks in the theory .",
    "our interest in this kind of observables is by no means academic , but rather it is dictated by the fact that many important observables fall into this class , such as mesonic and baryonic correlators , and in fact such observables have been extensively studied at @xmath4  @xcite . however ,",
    "less attention has been paid up to now to such correlators between observables made from quark fields in the context of dr .",
    "the reason is probably that the scale separation in these situations is less clear , since all fermionic matsubara modes have energies of order @xmath0 , due to their antiperiodic boundary condition .",
    "therefore , only the specific underlying dynamics can make dr possible for observables that are made directly with quarks .",
    "in other words , it is the theory itself that must generate the scale separation , a necessary condition for the decoupling of some degrees of freedom .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we were able to show in a specific asymptotically free theory , the gross - neveu model , that a new scale smaller than @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath5 , naturally emerges at high @xmath0 .",
    "it is this dynamically generated scale that provides the scale hierarchy that in turn makes dr possible for fermionic observables in that model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine what happens to qcd at high temperature , to verify that qcd undergoes dr to one - loop order also in the quark sector , and to give the corresponding explicit form of the reduced theory .",
    "as we will show , the dr in the quark sector is not based on the fact that the lightest matsubara mode @xmath6 is much lighter than the next lightest mode @xmath7 .",
    "instead , the small expansion parameter is the so - called off - shellness or residual momentum after subtracting @xmath8 .",
    "this expansion parameter roughly measures how far is a given configuration from the noninteracting valence state and its meaning can be clarified by considering the example of the hydrogen atom .",
    "one can usually ignore the two - electron - one - positron configuration relative to the one with a single electron , not because two electrons plus one positron are much heavier than one single electron , but rather due to the fact that the two - electron - one - positron configuration is about @xmath9 mev ( @xmath10 ) off the energy - shell of the free state , whereas the off - shellness of single - electron configuration is only due to the binding energy , @xmath11  ev .",
    "in the most strict sense dr requires that the reduced theory be renormalizable in three - dimensions and that corrections to correlations calculated in this reduced theory be suppressed by powers of @xmath12 .",
    "it is well - known that only the first few terms of the reduced theory are renormalizable in three - dimensions , even when all degrees of freedom are bosonic  @xcite . in our particular case",
    ", we also find a three - dimensional renormalizable lagrangian only up to one - loop order .",
    "nonetheless , we can still derive an effective theory that is capable of describing screening physics with an accuracy better than the leading order .",
    "this kind of reduced theory in general contains higher dimensional operators and needs to be defined in some well - defined regularization scheme .",
    "the coefficients of the reduced lagrangian are determined by requiring that , in the appropriate kinematic regime , the relevant one - particle irreducible graphs calculated in the reduced theory match the corresponding ones in the original theory .",
    "it is important to understand that , even though the coefficients are calculated perturbatively , the reduced theory is designed to maintain the infrared properties of the original theory and , hence , the solution of the reduced theory is in general nonperturbative  @xcite .    in the gross - neveu model",
    "@xcite we have explicitly shown that the fermionic degrees of freedom that survive in the reduced lagrangian are nonrelativistic .",
    "futhermore , it has been suggested  @xcite that the same happens to the quark degrees of freedom present in the qcd lagrangian at high @xmath0 . in this paper , we demonstrate that this is in fact the case for qcd and hence derive the nonrelativistic lagrangian for the quarks up to one loop with methods similar to those used in deriving the heavy - quark effective theory  @xcite .",
    "this effective lagrangian should reproduce screening mass splittings up to order @xmath2 and masses themselves up to order @xmath13 .",
    "we want to point out from the outset that our effective lagrangian is relevant for describing the long - distance behavior of spatial correlators only in those channels that are protected by some global symmetry ( such as baryon number and flavor ) from mixing with gluons , e.g. , baryonic and mesonic screening correlators .",
    "furthermore , this reduced theory is not meant for describing correlators that can mix with gluonic state ( their large distance behavior is dominated by screening glueball masses ) , thermodynamical potentials or other bulk quantities that are dominated by the bosonic zero modes . in these later cases ,",
    "the terms in the effective lagrangian containing fermions give irrelevant contributions and can be dropped .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .    in the next section we outline the general strategy and the criteria for dimensional reduction when",
    "observables made with quarks are involved . since the concepts we introduce in sec .",
    "[ dr ] are somewhat new and can not be explicitly found in the existing literature , we make the discussion as complete as possible . in particular , we first review the screening physics and the observables the effective theory is intended do describe , e.g. spatial correlators , screening masses and other observables that are identically zero when quarks are explicitly ignored .",
    "the relevant kinematic region and the exact meaning of the mass - shell condition in the context of screening physics are specified next .",
    "we finally introduce the expansion parameter , the off - shellness , in the same section .    in sec .",
    "[ drcalc ] we explicitly calculate the dr lagrangian , both at the tree and one - loop levels in the specified kinematic region .",
    "composite operators are considered in sec .",
    "[ co ] .    in sec .",
    "[ nrred ] we first discuss a power counting scheme that guarantees that the expansion parameter remains small and , therefore , that the expansion is self - consistent",
    ". then we derive an effective lagrangian for qcd , where quarks are treated nonrelativistically , in analogy with heavy quarkonium systems .",
    "the final form of the reduced lagrangian and the relationships between parameters in qcd and in the reduced theory are explicitly given .",
    "we finally discuss the temperature regime where the reduced theory becomes quantitatively reliable .",
    "the final section contains the summary and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we set the stage for generalizing the concept of dr to cases that explicitly involve fermions .",
    "first we give a brief review of screening physics and an overview of how dimensional reduction comes about : this intuitive guide to our calculation also serves the purpose of introducing an important concept , the `` mass - shell '' in screening quantities , that is extensively used throughout the paper .",
    "then we state the criterion for dr to take place when observables whose leading contribution comes from fermions are present , after having recapitulated the corresponding criterion for dr in a pure bosonic case .",
    "next we discuss in detail the relevant kinematic regions , relevant to screening physics , where dr could happen both for fundamental fermionic fields and for composite operators .",
    "finally , we outline the strategy for explicitly verifying whether dr occurs in qcd . where appropriate we elucidate similarities and differences with the heavy quark expansion .",
    "finite temperature screening physics can be directly and naturally formulated in terms of a lagrangian in the four - dimensional euclidean space . unlike real - time dynamics  @xcite , there is no need to eventually analytically continue results to the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowskian space - time , since screening phenomena are described by time - independent correlation functions . taking advantage of this static nature it is convenient to fourier transform the fields in the time direction in terms of matsubara frequencies . then the four - dimensional euclidean lagrangian can be equivalently rewritten as a three - dimensional euclidean lagrangian with an infinite number of matsubara modes .",
    "we typically want to study correlations between operators in the limit of spatial distances much larger than the thermal wavelength , or more specifically , we only consider correlators at @xmath14 .",
    "this large spatial separation selects a preferred direction , which we take along the first axis in the four - dimensional euclidean space whose zeroth component is the imaginary time .",
    "then the dominant large - distance contributions to such correlators come from the lowest singularities in the external momentum variable @xmath15 .",
    "if we consider a weakly interacting theory , it is intuitive that singularities appear when the external momentum is such that some of the denominators of the internal propagators vanish . since the four - momenta are euclidean and we consider massless particles , denominators are of the form @xmath16 and vanish either when @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( bosonic zero mode with vanishing spatial momentum ) or when some of the spatial components is imaginary , @xmath19 ( bosonic non - zero modes @xmath20 and fermionic modes @xmath21 ) .",
    "in this last case @xmath15 is purely imaginary , which corresponds to an exponentially decaying spatial correlation , a well - expected behavior when only non - zero modes are involved .    in the complex plane of @xmath15",
    "the condition that the euclidean four - momentum be zero becomes @xmath22 , which can be interpreted as the mass - shell condition in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowskian space - time for a particle with mass equal to the matsubara frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the concept of particles being on , close or off their `` mass - shell '' used throughout this paper to describe screening physics has the precise meaning given by this interpretation of the singularities in @xmath15 in the original four - dimensional static correlators .",
    "it should be emphasized that the screening singularities we have introduced here have no direct relation to real - time dynamics , which corresponds to singularities in real frequency in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional nonstatic correlators  @xcite .    finally , it is helpful to remind here that thermodynamical quantities are determined from static green s functions in the kinematic region with vanishing or small external momenta , in contrast with the screening physics directly involving quarks mentioned above .",
    "dr in the bosonic sector can be explained by the observation that there exists a clear scale separation when temperature is high enough .",
    "modes with non - vanishing matsubara frequencies have masses of order @xmath0 , while modes with zero matsubara frequency have masses of order one .",
    "if one is only interested in the dynamics of the static modes in the low momentum regime , nonstatic modes might play negligible role , since their effects can only be felt through virtual processes with energies comparable to or higher than their masses .",
    "the above intuitive picture can be formalized within the framework of perturbation theory in the following way .",
    "the ( d+1)-dimensional lagrangian @xmath24 is said to undergo dr to a specific @xmath25-dimensional lagrangian @xmath26 , in the high-@xmath0 limit and to a given order in the coupling constant , if all the _ static _",
    "greens functions of @xmath24 , @xmath27 , are equal to the corresponding green s functions of @xmath26 , @xmath28 , up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath12 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents possible external dimensionful parameters of the theory , such as a usual mass parameter . in general , the form and",
    "the parameters of @xmath26 are determined by the original theory .",
    "these naive expectations based on a tree - level power counting fail because of dynamically generated scales of order @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these dynamically generated scales only induce corrections proportional to powers of the coupling .",
    "if the coupling is small , the concept is still useful and the reduced theory still provides a simplified physics picture .    it is apparent that if the original theory is renormalizable in @xmath31 dimensions , the reduced theory is a super - renormalizable theory in general , since the coupling in the reduced theory will have positive dimension in mass units .",
    "however , whether the ultraviolet behavior of the reduced theory is truly improved depends on whether all matsubara modes , except a finite number , decouple .",
    "finally , we remind that beyond tree - level dr manifests explicitly in the reduced lagrangian only in certain specific classes of subtraction schemes  @xcite , although the physics of dr for a given theory is of course a scheme independent phenomenon . we shall make further comments on this point , when we discuss the choice of the coupling constant in the reduced theory .",
    "due to the antiperiodic boundary condition in the temporal direction , all fermionic fields have tree - level masses of order @xmath0 . as a consequence , fermions are usually treated like implicit degrees of freedom in the high-@xmath0 limit . however , there are situations where we want to study observables that directly involve fermions and that are zero if no explicit fermionic dynamics is kept .",
    "a typical example is the correlation between mesonic currents , which is defined in terms of fermionic fields : the lagrangian does not include terms that couple such currents directly to bosonic fields and the leading contribution is given by fermionic modes .",
    "when studying such cases , does it still make sense to ask whether some of the fermionic modes are more important than others ?",
    "the naive answer might be negative , since there exists no obvious scale separation between the lightest fermionic modes @xmath32 and the rest .",
    "this apparent lack of a scale separation is also reflected in the fact that the typical spatial momenta of the fermionic modes at high temperature are not small relative to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , even in the free theory case , fermions are always on their mass - shell and hence @xmath33 is of the order @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the expansion in @xmath34 is meaningless .    however , qcd is asymptotically free and quarks are weakly interacting in the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "as previously discussed , in this weakly interacting regime , quarks are almost on their `` mass - shell '' .",
    "this intuitive picture suggests us that the relevant small scale is not the typical spatial momentum , which is large even in the free theory , but the amount by which the interaction brings the spatial momentum off the free - theory mass - shell ( the `` off - shellness '' ) or , in other words , the residual momentum after the contribution from the mass has been subtracted out .",
    "if we consider , for example , one of the lowest matsubara modes @xmath35 , we can define the dynamical residual momentum @xmath36 and , similarly to the bosonic case , we say that the theory undergoes dr , if all the _",
    "greens functions @xmath27 are equal to the corresponding green s functions @xmath28 up to corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath12 : @xmath37 where again @xmath30 represents possible external dimensionful parameters of the theory .",
    "similarly to bosonic cases , corrections are suppressed only by powers of the coupling constants instead of powers of @xmath12 when there are dynamically generated masses proportional to @xmath0 or , as we shall see , when the specific dynamics makes the residual momentum proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the situation we have described for the high-@xmath0 expansion in the quark sector shows several similarities with the heavy quark expansion in qcd  @xcite . in fact , the heavy quark degrees of freedom can usually be integrated out leaving power suppressed corrections if our interest is in light quark observables , such as the @xmath25 meson .",
    "when we also want to study observables that involve heavy quarks , such as heavy quarkonia , the explicit heavy degrees of freedom must be retained .",
    "in addition , the effective theory that describes the heavy quark sector is also derived by expanding in the residual momentum relative to the heavy quark mass .    however , there are two major differences between the heavy quark expansion and the high-@xmath0 expansion for quarks .",
    "one difference is that , in the latter case , we need to integrate out an infinite number of matsubara modes for each flavor , whereas in the former only the antiquark degree of freedom is integrated out for each flavor .",
    "the other difference is that the coupling constant in the high-@xmath0 reduced theory is , for pure dimensional reasons , proportional to @xmath0 , while the coupling constant in the heavy - quark effective ( hqe ) theory , is independent of ( or at worst logarithmically dependent on ) the heavy quark mass .",
    "the first difference leads to the consequence that the hqe theory maintains the original dimensionality @xmath38 and the high-@xmath0 effective theory has its dimensionality reduced by one .",
    "the second difference implies that , contrary to the hqe theory , the accuracy of the high-@xmath0 effective theory is usually worsened from powers of @xmath12 to only powers of the coupling .",
    "following the strategy described at the beginning of this section , we examine here what are the precise kinematic regions where dr can take place in the fermionic sector for fundamental and composite operators .    from now on we call light modes the static gluon ( @xmath39 ) and the lightest quarks ( @xmath40 ) , while the rest of the modes are denoted as the heavy modes .",
    "an external light quark close to its mass shell has a momentum of the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the `` particle '' characterized by @xmath43 : the same considerations can be trivially repeated for the other light mode @xmath44 .",
    "here and in the following each quark mode of different matsubara frequency is regarded as a `` flavor '' in the three - dimensional theory .",
    "quotes are used to distinguish this use of the word `` flavor '' from the usual one .",
    "since the on - shell condition is defined in minkowskian space , we choose @xmath15 as the `` time '' component or energy in the reduced world ( the original time component @xmath45 becomes a chirally invariant mass ) .",
    "then the residual momentum is defined as @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the alternative choice of @xmath50 can be interpreted as the interchanging of particle and antiparticle of the same `` flavor '' .    of course , one can also choose @xmath51 with @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath15 being close to one of the heavy mass - shell .",
    "however , the physically most relevant singularities are those closest to the origin in the complex plane of @xmath15 , since only these are practically measurable on the lattice . therefore , we only limit ourselves to the cases of @xmath53 .",
    "a static gluon close to its mass - shell has a momentum of the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the definition of the high-@xmath0 expansion as an expansion around the mass - shell of the weakly interacting modes reproduces the usual condition when applied to the bosonic sector ( pure yang - mills case ) .",
    "the rationale underlying the choice of the relevant kinematic regime when composite operators , such as meson and baryon currents , are present is the same as the one used in the quark and gluon sector : we expect small deviations from the free theory .    for a static mesonic current with momentum @xmath54 ,",
    "the lowest singularity starts at @xmath56 , as one can easily verify considering the free fermion - bubble graph .",
    "this singularity corresponds to the lowest particle - antiparticle threshold , where particles and antiparticles are defined as the excitations near the two possible mass - shell conditions : @xmath57 and @xmath58 . to be consistent with this condition ,",
    "the momenta of the particle and antiparticle in the composite operator have the form @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the momenta running along the free fermion - bubble show clearly why we call , in the reduced theory , quarks with the same @xmath45 but `` opposite '' @xmath15 components particle and antiparticle , while we distinguish quarks with different @xmath45 components using different `` flavor '' .",
    "we could perform a similar analysis for baryonic currents . since we do not anticipate any further conceptual problem in this kind of extension , we consider in this work only mesonic currents .        in the relevant kinematic region , we can classify propagators according to their behavior close to mass - shell and then construct a corresponding power - counting scheme that characterizes the behavior of a given graph .",
    "for example , it is trivial to verify that , when close to mass - shell , a light - fermion propagator is of the order @xmath64 , while a static gluon propagator is of the order of @xmath65 , relative to propagators of heavy modes .    the energy - momentum conservation at each vertex forces internal quark lines of a graph whose external lines are close to their mass - shell to remain themselves close to the mass - shell , unless at least one of the internal lines is heavy .",
    "however , a graph that involves internal heavy lines is suppressed relative to the same graph with the heavy lines replaced by light ones , as it is trivially demonstrated by the propagator classification given above .",
    "this result , in turn , implies that any tree graph with only light external quark or antiquark lines is correctly reproduced by the corresponding tree graph in the reduced theory .",
    "the fact that the dominant contributions to screening observables come from the kinematic regions where the external line are close to their mass - shell in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowskian space implies that the relevant power counting that establishes the relative importance of the difference graphs is not the usual one in euclidean space .",
    "this necessity of explicitly considering the contributions of the minkowskian singularities makes the power counting for graphs involving loops less straightforward than at the tree level .",
    "fortunately , the number of graphs at a given order in the loop expansion is finite . at the one - loop level",
    "this number is small .",
    "we can just perform an explicit calculation and isolate the important contributions .",
    "the strategy we adopt is the following .",
    "we consider any graph , @xmath66 , in the original theory in 3 + 1 dimensions , where @xmath67 is close to the mass - shell , and we then decompose this graph into terms recognizable as three - dimensional graphs .",
    "we achieve this result by first separating out those terms in @xmath66 that involve only light lines : these terms are by definition reproduced by the reduced tree - level three - dimensional lagrangian and we denote them by @xmath68 .",
    "the remaining contributions to @xmath66 involve at least one heavy line and we define them as @xmath69 .",
    "we say that dr occurs if all such @xmath69 s can be made local , i.e. if they result in a polynomial in the residual momentum @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , dr occurs , if @xmath71 where @xmath72 has either the form of terms already present in the tree - level reduced lagrangian ( its effect is the renormalization of the relevant parameters ) or the form of a new renormalizable vertex .",
    "more generally , the reduced theory needs also to contain nonrenormalizable vertices if we want to reproduce graphs to higher orders ; these terms can be treated consistently in the context of an effective theory ( see sec .  [ nrred ] ) .",
    "at the tree level the reduced theory can be simply obtained by fourier transforming the qcd lagrangian and then retaining only the static gluonic fields and the quark fields ( after rescaling a factor of @xmath73 ) with lowest matsubara frequencies @xmath74 ) , @xmath75\\psi_l \\ , , \\label{qcd_3d}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed that quarks are massless and have @xmath79 flavors .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the two vertices of @xmath80 that involve quarks : the graphical notation is such that a thick ( thin ) solid line represents a quark with frequency @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and a wiggly line represents a static gluon .",
    "the coupling @xmath81 is related to the four - dimensional coupling through @xmath82 . at the tree level",
    "the subtraction scale @xmath83 is not yet specified .",
    "since @xmath84 is a super - renormalizable theory in three dimensions , all the dynamical scales must be set by the coupling constant @xmath82 and temperature @xmath0 .    of course ,",
    "once loop corrections are included , the reduced theory in eq .",
    "( [ qcd_3d ] ) acquires new vertices and the coupling constant @xmath85 has a more complicated dependence on the original coupling @xmath86 . for example",
    ", @xmath85 can receive corrections such as @xmath87 and so on .",
    "however , since qcd is asymptotically free , the appropriately defined coupling constant ( dr is only manifest in subtraction schemes that require @xmath88  @xcite ) has the asymptotic behavior @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the corrections to the tree - level form of @xmath81 should not modify the fact that the two dynamical scales be @xmath90 and @xmath0 itself at high temperature .",
    "the criterion according to which we choose @xmath88 is in general to minimize loop corrections to the leading result .",
    "we shall discuss the precise choice of the proportionality constant later in the paper .",
    "the vertices that involve light quarks in the reduced theory , the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are not the only vertices present in the original theory",
    ". there are additional vertices that involve at least one heavy mode ; we show them in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with the notation that a double line stands for a heavy quark mode and a spring - like line stands for a nonstatic gluon mode .",
    "these vertices are collectively called @xmath91 . in the first vertex",

    "[ fig2 ] involve a nonstatic gluon and , therefore , the fermionic line changes its `` flavor '' ; we call these vertices `` flavor - changing '' .",
    "since we are only interested in graphs with light modes in the external lines , energy - momentum conservation implies that these heavy vertices can not contribute at the tree level .",
    "our job is to verify whether the corrections induced by these heavy vertices at the one - loop order can be accounted for , in the high-@xmath0 limit , either by readjusting the parameters of @xmath80 or by adding additional local and renormalizable vertices .      in the following calculations we use the dimensional regularization for spatial integrals , @xmath92\\ , , \\label{dim_reg}\\ ] ] and the @xmath93 subtraction scheme . for convenience , we work in the feynman gauge and use the euclidean feynman rules given by ramond  @xcite .",
    "the subtraction point @xmath83 needs to be proportional to @xmath0 to make the dr manifest  @xcite , then we define the @xmath0-dependent coupling constant @xmath94 by choosing @xmath95 the temperature independent constant @xmath96 can be read as a convenient way of parameterizing one of the possible subtraction schemes .",
    "the specific choice @xmath97 corresponds , for instance , to the scheme that makes dr optimal for the pure - gluon effective action in the background field method  @xcite .",
    "we shall comment later on alternative choices such as the one that makes dr optimal in terms of the quark - gluon vertex function . in the following we also use the auxiliary coupling @xmath98 for the sake of making formulae more compact .    without any loss of generality ,",
    "we only show results for cases with external quark - line frequency @xmath99 ; trivial modifications yield the corresponding results for the other light `` flavor '' with @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , we select the particle sector , which we have defined as the kinematic region where the first component of the spatial momentum is close to @xmath101 ; again there are only trivial differences for the antiparticle sector , which is defined by the alternative choice of the spatial component being close to @xmath102 , and that is separated from the particle sector by a off-(mass)shellness @xmath103 .    in the matsubara - frequency loop - sum",
    ", the term with zero frequency can be easily recognized as the contribution from the three - dimensional tree - level lagrangian itself , up to trivial factors of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , when computing the loop corrections due to the heavy matsubara modes , we leave out the term with @xmath104 , which is the direct contribution from the light modes and it is already generated by the reduced theory .",
    "the calculation of the one - loop amplitudes and their high temperature expansion around the appropriate kinematic regions can be done following a standard procedure , which , in general , involves the following steps : + ( 1 ) combine the denominators by means of the feynman parameter representation and perform the spatial momentum integral ; + ( 2 ) shift the external momenta : @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; + ( 3 ) expand the result in terms of the residual momenta over @xmath0 , e.g. @xmath107 ; + ( 4 ) perform the integrals over the feynman parameters ; + ( 5 ) perform the matsubara sum and express the result in terms of the riemann zeta function .",

    "the basic strategy is the following .",
    "we write down the most general nonrelativistic lagrangian , with terms up to some power in the appropriate power counting scheme .",

    "if we want to reach the same accuracy we have obtained for the energy differences ( splittings ) , i.e. @xmath2 , also for the zero - point energy shift we need to perform a two - loop calculation of the quark self - energy .",

    "for example , we expect that the reduced theory is capable of describing the screening states , e.g. those states that describe the spatial correlation of mesonic currents ; these states can be interpreted as bound states in the reduced world and hence they are beyond those 1pi graphs we have used to derive the reduced theory .",

    "i.e. those states that dominate the large - distance correlation between currents , the lightest quark mode is close to its mass - shell , and the self - consistency of the reduced theory is guaranteed by the power counting rule given in table  [ table2 ] , which have been justified in refs .",
    "@xcite , exactly in parallel with the heavy quarkonium systems .",
    "the essence of the argument is that , if the interaction is weak , the off - shellness is small .    a final word of caution about the usefulness of this reduced theory .",
    "thermodynamic quantities , such as the free energy , specific heat and so on , are dominated by the gluonic zero modes . as it is well - known ,",
    "quarks are heavy relative to gluonic zero modes and hence their contribution to thermodynamic quantities is suppressed at high @xmath0 .",
    "this is perhaps the reason why quark degrees of freedom have never been considered relevant at high @xmath0 , until one has been explicitly interested in the mesonic and baryonic screening states .",
    "the effective theory we derived is not intended for bulk thermodynamic observables , but only for those screening states that do not mix with purely gluonic states .",
    "at last we have obtained a reduced theory that includes the quark sector and that should be valid in the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "however , we still face the practical question of estimating the temperature above which this dr theory is going to be a good approximation to qcd .    we know that dr is manifest only in a limited class of subtraction schemes  @xcite , but even within this class there is some freedom left : one aspect of this freedom is the choice of the coupling constant in the reduced theory @xmath240 . while it is unambiguous how @xmath13 runs with @xmath0 , the numerical value of @xmath13 at a specific temperature depends on how we match",
    "the reduced and the original theory .",
    "for instance , we have argued that a physically relevant way of choosing the coupling in the pure gluonic sector is to match the effective actions in the background field scheme  @xcite .",
    "this specific choice yields that dr in the pure glue sector sets in around @xmath241 , i.e. the coupling constant is sufficiently small at that temperature .",
    "this freedom in the choice of the relevant coupling constant can be rephrased in our formalism with the freedom of choosing the scale @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ scale_mu ] ) where @xmath96 has different values in different schemes .",
    "since our present interest is to solve screening states of quarks , it might be better to choose the subtraction parameter @xmath96 with the criterion that the one - loop couplings @xmath81 and @xmath242 be as close as possible to their tree - level values .",
    "for example , if we demand @xmath243 , we get @xmath244 ( if @xmath245 ) .",
    "this choice would make the subtraction scale @xmath83 defined in eq .",
    "( [ scale_mu ] ) larger than the one obtained from the criterion of optimal dr for gluons , which yields instead @xmath246 ( @xmath245 and @xmath247 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if we demand @xmath248 , we find a even larger subtraction scale @xmath83 ( @xmath249 ) .    in either case",
    ", the fact that the subtraction scale is larger makes the effective coupling constant at a given temperature smaller in the quark sector than in the pure gluonic sector .",
    "this result is certainly in qualitative agreement with the empirical fact that the dr in the quark sector sets in at temperatures almost right above the critical point  @xcite , whereas dr in the pure gluon sector sets in at about @xmath250  @xcite .",
    "we have shown with an explicit one - loop calculation that qcd at high temperature undergoes dimensional reduction also in the quark sector .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that static one - particle irreducible graphs contributing to the original four - dimensional correlation functions can be reproduced by a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional renormalizable lagrangian to order @xmath13 in the kinematic region where the lowest matsubara quark modes are close to their `` mass - shell '' .",
    "physical reasons why this kinematic region is relevant to screening phenomena have been also discussed .",
    "the reduced theory only contains the zero modes of the gauge field and the lowest quark modes as the explicit degrees of freedom and has the form given by eq .",
    "( [ qcd_3d ] ) plus the four - fermion term of eq .",
    "( [ fourquark ] ) .",
    "aiming at a better description of the mesonic and baryonic screening states , we have further improved the reduced theory to order @xmath2 via a nonrelativistic reduction , which results in the reduced effective lagrangian of eqs .",
    "( [ l_reduced ] ) and ( [ l_b ] ) .",
    "in fact , while the relativistic version of the reduced theory mixes different orders in the coupling when used in the kinematic region relevant to screening physics , the nonrelativistic reduction explicitly separates the contribution of particles and antiparticles and allows a correct counting of the expansion parameter .",
    "furthermore , we have also argued that the reduced theory in the quark sector , i.e. for screening mesonic and baryonic correlators that do not mix with entirely gluonic states , should become accurate at temperatures slightly above the chiral restoration transition temperature , due to the smallness of the appropriate running coupling @xmath120 . in particular , we find that the temperature above which the reduced theory becomes reliable in the quark sector should be even lower than the corresponding temperature in the pure gluonic sector  @xcite .",
    "our result has the potential for explaining present lattice data  @xcite and provides a formal basis to the recent phenomenological modeling  @xcite of the same data .",
    "we would like to stress that , although the reduced lagrangian has been derived in a perturbative context , the reduced theory embodies all the infrared physics of the original theory , i.e. qcd at high temperature .",
    "therefore , the solution of the reduced theory should reproduce the full long - wavelength screening physics of qcd in the high-@xmath0 limit , which is nonperturbative : nonperturbative approaches such as lattice simulations are required to find this solution .",
    "luckily since the large scale ( @xmath0 ) has been explicitly factored out , it is now straightforward to put the nonrelativistic version of the reduced theory on a lattice following , for example , the method of ref .",
