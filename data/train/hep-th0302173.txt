    "it has been conjectured @xcite that because of the interplay of quantum mechanics and general relativity at the planck scale , space - time ought to be regarded as a derived concept whose structure should follow from the properties of quantum field theory .",
    "perturbative quantum field theory ( pqft ) , albeit its conceivable limitations at distances of the order of the planck length , is the only computational tool available at present , and so the elucidation of the mathematical structures behind that theory is a suggestive first step in pursuing this line of thought .",
    "one of these structures , which is based on the original work of kreimer @xcite and further developed in @xcite , is now generally known as the hopf algebra of renormalization and it provides the underlying mathematics behind the forest formula in the process of renormalization .",
    "basically this hopf algebra can be represented by feynman diagrams or decorated rooted trees , where decorations are one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) divergent diagrams without subdivergences .",
    "other hopf algebras related to rooted trees and to the hopf algebra of renormalization have been discussed in the literature , such as the vector space hopf algebra of rooted trees of larson and grossman @xcite .",
    "the connection of this algebra with the algebra of kreimer and connes was analyzed in @xcite and more recently revised in @xcite . for a formulation in terms of a single mathematical construction of the several hopf algebras described by rooted trees see van der laan @xcite .",
    "+ the essential point of the kreimer - connes formalism is that * given that a theory is renormalizable * an appropriately defined twisted antipode , based on the minimal subtraction scheme of renormalization , generates the counterterms corresponding to the bphz forest formula and the antipode axiom provides a systematic procedure for deriving the physically correct and finite expression for a given diagram .",
    "however , the mere fact that the twisted antipode axiom , or for that matter the forest formula , provide a finite answer does not suffice to make the theory physical .",
    "it is crucial , in order that the theory be renormalizable , that the resulting counterterms are of the same form as those in the original lagrangian and that they can be absorbed into the bare parameters of the renormalized lagrangian in a consistent manner .",
    "generally this is not possible , and in such a case the theory is described as non - renormalizable .",
    "of course if we know _ a priori _ that the theory is renormalizable then the hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees or of feynman diagrams remains most valuable both as the mathematical structure behind the forest formula as well as for a systematic construction of renormalized green functions .",
    "+ another hopf algebra related to rooted trees by a canonical mapping is the algebra of normal coordinates that was recently discussed in @xcite . in that work",
    "undecorated rooted trees were considered , and the relevance of normal coordinates to the concept of k - primitiveness as well as their role in the process of renormalization was analyzed .",
    "it was also shown there that for undecorated ladder trees , or to that effect for non - branched trees with only one decoration ( such as in rainbow diagrams ) , the renormalization of the associated normal coordinates is a one step procedure . however , when the diagrams for a theory involve more than one decoration ( as is usually the case ) ladder normal coordinates are in general no longer primitive , even though one can still expect them to posses a milder pole structure than that present in the rooted tree coordinates .",
    "some of the pertinent questions left open in the above cited paper concerned the physical interpretation of the normal coordinates and whether perturbation theory could be formulated directly in terms of them without having to go first through the algebra of rooted trees or feynman diagrams .",
    "these questions provided some partial motivation for the present work where we investigate some additional hopf algebra structures that can be associated naturally to the hausdorff series expansion of pqft .",
    "specifically , we show here that the power sum symmetric functionals of these perturbative expansions are elements of a free lie subalgebra as well as hopf primitives of its enveloping free algebra .",
    "moreover these primitives can be expressed as linear combinations of hall polynomials and , diagrammatically , as hall trees .",
    "we show also that a hall tree corresponds to sums of feynman diagrams , each with the same number of vertices , external legs and loops .",
    "+ in addition , since the lie subalgebra admits a derivation endomorphism , we further show that - with respect to it - these primitives are cyclic vectors generated by the free propagator , and thus provide a recursion relation by means of which the ( n+1)-vertex connected green functions can be derived systematically from the n - vertex ones .",
    "lastly we show that the hopf primitives considered here are normal coordinates resulting from a canonical mapping applied to the poincar - birkhoff - witt basis constructed from the complete homogeneous symmetric functionals , which appear also naturally in the hausdorff series expansion of pqft .",
    "this combinatorics is reminiscent of the one appearing in @xcite , but the possibility of a deeper relationship between the two hopf algebras , and therefore a possible physical interpretation for the normal coordinates in @xcite , requires further investigation . + the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we begin with a brief review of the main steps that lead to the perturbative expansion of the transition amplitude , and describe its relation to the hausdorff series and to the associated hopf algebras for which the power sum functionals are primitives . in subsections 2.1.1 - 2.1.3 the free algebra related to these structures is discussed and it is shown that the functional primitives are linear combinations of the hall polynomials that generate the lie subalgebra of our free algebra .",
    "we also show that this lie subalgebra admits a derivation endomorphism with respect to which all the primitives are cyclic vectors generated by the free propagator .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of the primitives in terms of hall trees is also discussed in this section and shown to give a clear image of this cyclicity and of the iteration process by means of which the @xmath0-vertex connected green functions can be constructed from the @xmath1-vertex ones .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a discussion of our main results and possible lines of future related research .",
    "we also give there an explicit and heuristic argument , based on a birkhoff decomposition of the hopf algebra considered here , which we believe helps to stress some of the points made in this introduction .",
    "let us begin with a brief summary of the essential steps in pqft leading to the green functions , with the dual purpose of making our presentation self contained as well as for identifying the basic mathematical and physical entities to which the hopf algebras considered here are related .",

    "+ the analytical expressions for the graphs composing the green functions result , in general , in ultraviolet divergences , and the standard procedure for removing them is to first apply dimensional regularization and then successively the forest formula .",
    "it is at this stage where the kreimer - connes hopf algebra formalism provides an important insight into the underlying mathematics behind the forest formula of renormalization . indeed , by noting that each feynman diagram corresponds to a decorated rooted tree ( or a sum of decorated rooted trees in the case of overlapping diagrams ) and that these rooted trees , as well as the diagrams themselves , are the generators of respective universal enveloping hopf algebras",
    ", these authors have shown that the operation with a twisted antipode on the algebra provides a systematic application of the forest formula and , consequently , a systematic procedure for generating the counterterms needed by the theory in order to cancel the unwanted infinities .",
    "connes and kreimer further show @xcite the relation between the algebra of characters , dual to their hopf algebra , and the birkhoff algebraic decomposition .",
    "a detailed exposition of these ideas may be found in the papers cited in the introduction .",
    "+ here we only stress once more the fact that in our approach we deal with the hopf primitives @xmath156 rather than with feynman graphs directly . as we have seen , these hopf primitives are lie polynomials where each monomial is a hall tree that itself corresponds to a sum of feynman diagrams with @xmath28-vertices each and an equal number of external legs and loops .",
    "this last observation can be read off directly from the word composed by the foliage of a hall tree .",
    "first because the number of external legs @xmath157 in the feynman diagrams constituting a hall tree is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 so all feynman diagrams composing a given hall tree have the same number of external legs .",
    "second , because the topology of the feynman diagrams implies that the number of loops is fixed by the number of vertices and the number of external legs by the relation @xmath160 where @xmath155 is the total number of legs per vertex ( @xmath155=4 for the @xmath14 theory ) , and @xmath161 is the number of loops , so also all feynman diagrams composing a hall tree have the same loop number .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , given that a theory is renormalizable , the hopf algebra of renormalization developed by connes and kreimer provides insight into the mathematical structures behind the forest formula and is extremely useful in numerical calculations since it gives a systematic procedure ( amenable to computer programming @xcite ) for evaluating the renormalized green functions . in a parallel vein ,",
    "the hopf algebra @xmath44 investigated here , helps to exhibit some complementary mathematical structures associated with the hausdorff series expansion of perturbation theory .",
    "we have shown the relation of the @xmath26 $ ] s to the hall polynomials , and that of their graphic representation in terms of hall trees to the feynman diagrams .",
    "also , making use of the cyclic vector character of the @xmath26 $ ] s with respect to the derivation endomorphism @xmath63 , which appears as part of the structure of the lie subalgebra of @xmath44 , we have obtained a systematic procedure ( also subject to computer programming ) for constructing all the green functions of the theory starting from the generator @xmath42 $ ] . moreover , since each action of @xmath63 introduces an additional vertex in the commutators conforming the @xmath26 $ ] s , one could hope that a further study of this operator and its possible deformations would result in further mathematical insights on the process of renormalization .",
    "+ note , however , that because of the hopf primitive character of our @xmath26 $ ] s and their relation to the green functions given by ( [ 14a ] ) one should not expect that the application of the algebraic birkhoff decomposition to our hopf algebra should be immediately related to the forest formula .",
    "the hopf algebra of renormalization begins where our hopf algebra ends .",
    "nonetheless , a unital @xmath45-algebra homomorphism @xmath162 from the free algebra @xmath163 to the ( unital ) @xmath45-algebra @xmath164 of meromorphic functions on the riemann sphere with poles at the origin , followed by a the birkhoff decomposition allows us to exhibit more explicitely and in a heuristic fashion the point made in the second paragraph of the introduction .",
    "indeed @xcite , if we let @xmath165 be a birkhoff sum of the @xmath45-linear multiplicative subspaces @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and if we further let @xmath171 be the rota - baxter projection operator , satisfying the multiplicative constraints @xmath172 , \\ ; a , b\\in { \\bf a},\\label{23a}\\ ] ] then the algebraic birkhoff decomposition @xmath173 ( where the operator @xmath174 denotes the convolution product @xmath175 ) , together with the hopf primitive character of the @xmath26 $ ] s immediately imply that @xmath176)=\\phi_{+}(\\psi_{k}[j])-\\phi_{-}(\\psi_{k}[j])=\\phi_{+}(\\psi_{k}[j])+t\\phi(\\psi_{k}[j]).\\label{25g}\\ ] ]    thus , by virtue of ( [ 14a ] ) , @xmath177j_{1}\\dots j_{n } \\rangle\\big),\\label{28bb } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have put the projector @xmath178 inside of the integration in the second term of ( [ 28bb ] ) after taking into account that the currents @xmath179 are good test functions , so the pole structure of the integrals is determined by that of the green functions .",
    "in addition , the projection by @xmath178 to @xmath180 of the connected green functions is taken in the mass independent renormalization scheme .",
    "+ recall now the basic equation of the renormalization group which relates the dimensionally regularized bare and renormalized connected green functions , and which in our notation reads : @xmath181)_{b}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial j_{1}}\\dots \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial j_{n}}\\sum_{k\\geq 0}\\lambda^{k } ( \\psi_{k}[j])_{r}.\\label{28bbb}\\ ] ] in the above , the subscript @xmath182 denotes that the regularized green functions in the momentum representation , occurring in the @xmath26 $ ] s , are expressed in terms of the bare parameters of the theory , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath183)_{b}=\\sum_{n=0}(\\psi^{(n)}_{k}[j])_{b}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{b}^{k}}\\sum_{n=0 } \\frac{1}{(n)!}\\langle ( g^{(n)}_{k})_{b}(p_{1},\\dots , p_{n};\\lambda_{b } , m_{b } , \\epsilon)$ ] , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , while the subscript @xmath187 on the right side of ( [ 28bbb ] ) denotes the @xmath146 s evaluated with the renormalized green functions .",
    "furthermore , in the mass independent scheme the counterterms contain no finite contributions and are polynomials in inverse powers of @xmath188 with coefficients depending only on @xmath24 , so the renormalization parameters @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are polynomials in inverse powers of @xmath188 with coefficients depending only on @xmath24 .",
    "+ if we replace ( [ 25 g ] ) in ( [ 28bbb ] ) and observe that the right side of the later equation is finite , we thus arrive at the following set of equations : @xmath192=\\\\ \\sum_{k\\geq 0}(g^{(n)}_{k}(p_{1},\\dots , p_{n};\\lambda , m , ) _ { r},\\label{29bb } \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath193    where @xmath194,\\label{30bb } \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath195    but if , and only if , the theory is renormalizable the equations ( [ 29cc ] ) can be solved consistently and order by order in the powers of @xmath24 , @xmath196 only then the counterterms can be absorbed into the parameters of the theory , and only then the theory will be physical .",
    "formally , the substitution of the resulting renormalization functions into the left side of ( [ 29bb ] ) would then yield the physically meaningful renormalized green functions .",
    "in such a case , however , the standard recursive elimination of subdivergences via the forest formula ( or the connes - kreimer hopf algebra ) would clearly be a more efficient manner to derive these quantities .",
    "on the other hand , the opposite is not necessarily true : the fact that the forest formula provides a finite answer does not suffice to make the theory physical , it is also necessary that the poles of the ill - defined regularized green functions can be absorbed into the bare parameters of the theory . + to conclude , we would like to comment on several other possible lines for future work in addition to the ones already mentioned .",
    "thus , for example , since there is a duality between concatenation and shuffle products @xcite , there are actually two bialgebra structures on @xmath163 : the one considered here with product ( words ) made out by concatenation of letters of the alphabet @xmath50 and coproduct defined by ( 16 - 18 ) , the other one with shuffle product and coproduct defined by @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the free monoid on @xmath50",
    ". it may be interesting to investigate the relation of this other bialgebra to the primitives @xmath26 $ ] discussed here , and if this relation has a possible relevance to renormalization .",
    "+ one could also ask if it is possible to carry out a program starting from the hopf algebra of feynman diagrams and perform a legendre transformation to a hopf algebra of @xmath146 , which would no longer be primitive , and by exponentiation to a hopf algebra of @xmath37 .",
    "it would be interesting then to consider not only the hopf algebra @xmath199 but also @xmath200 , where @xmath201 stands for an equivalence relation coming @xmath202 from a ward identity ( we are grateful to the referee for pointing out this possible program ) .",
