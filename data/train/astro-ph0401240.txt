    "we chose to show the 85% contours instead of the commonly used 90% contours because the 85% contours touch exactly in this case .",
    "based on these contours , the probability that the iron lines in the spectrum of image a and the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d have strengths that are consistent with each other is less than 0.02 . for this confidence contour plot",
    "we fixed the parameters of the power - law component of the model to their best - fit values listed in fit 5 of table 1 .",
    "we conclude that the fe  k@xmath0 line in the spectrum of image a is significantly enhanced by a factor of about six from that of the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d.",
    "our re - analysis of the x - ray spectra of the individual lensed images of h  1413 + 117  indicates the presence of a microlensing event in image a because ( a ) the flux fraction of image a , [ a/(a+b+c+d ) ] , is a factor of 1.55 @xmath1 0.17 larger in the x - ray band than what was detected in the _ hst _ r - band , ( b ) a redshifted narrow iron line is present with a relatively high significance only in the spectrum of image a. to obtain additional insight on the possible energy dependence of the magnification of image a , we estimated relative enhancements of image fluxes in the continuum and iron - line emission components based on fit 5 of table 1 . specifically , we find that the ratio of the x - ray fluxes of image a and the combined images b , c and d in the iron line component is [ a/(b+c+d)]@xmath36 @xmath37 1.7 at the 85% confidence level ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the ratio of the x - ray flux densities at 1  kev ( observed frame ) in the continuum component is [ a/(b+c+d)]@xmath38 = 0.8 @xmath1 0.2 ( 90% confidence intervals ) .",
    "these values differ significantly from the _ hst _ r - band flux ratio of [ a/(b+c+d)]@xmath39=0.41@xmath10.01 which is expected to be less affected by a microlensing event produced by a star or group of stars in the foreground lensing galaxy since the characteristic sizes of the x - ray continuum emission regions of quasars are expected to be considerably less than the sizes of the optical r - band emission regions . specifically , variability studies indicate that the sizes of the x - ray and optical continuum emission regions are @xmath2 4@xmath40  cm and @xmath2 4@xmath41  cm , respectively ( e.g. , chartas et al . 2001 ; dai et al 2002 ; wyithe et al .",
    "we note that since the flux fraction of image a in the x - ray continuum is greater than the flux fraction in the r band , the large equivalent width of the fe line in image a is not caused by a decrease in the x - ray continuum but is more likely produced by an amplification of the flux of the line .",
    "a scenario in which intrinsic variability is the cause of the detection of a strong iron line in only image a and a significantly weaker line in the combined spectrum of images b , c and d requires fine tuning such that the flare of the iron line needs to occur within a certain window in time for it to be detected with a large @xmath42 in only one image and the flare must last for only a few days .",
    "our simple two singular isothermal sphere lens model for h  1413 + 117  predicts that image b leads images c , a , and d by 5  days , 9  days and 16  days respectively . a similar lens model by chae & turnshek ( 1999 )",
    "was found to reproduce the observed relative amplifications fairly accurately .",
    "another strong argument against the intrinsic variability interpretation is that changes of factors of @xmath2 6 in the equivalent width of a fluorescent fe  k@xmath43 line in a seyfert 1 galaxy over periods of a few days have not been detected to date ( e.g. , markowitz , edelson & vaughan 2003 ; gliozzi , sambruna & eracleous 2003 ; lee et al .",
    "2000 ; leighly 1999 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the amplitude of fe  k@xmath43 line variability to be less in quasars than in seyfert 1 galaxies due to the larger sizes and luminosities of quasars .",
    "x - ray variability , at least of the continuum emission in seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars , is found to be anticorrelated with x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , nandra et al . 1997 ; turner et al .",
    "1999 ; george et al .",
    "2000 ; dai et al .",
    "a more likely explanation of the observed energy dependent magnification in the x - ray band and the enhancement of image a in the x - ray band compared to that in the optical is a microlensing event in image a. such an event will not lead to time - delayed magnifications in the remaining images and therefore can explain the non - detection of the fe  k@xmath43 line in the remaining images .",
    "a characteristic size scale commonly used in microlensing analysis is the projected einstein ring radius of the star , @xmath44 .",
    "emission regions with a size significantly larger than @xmath44 will not be affected by microlensing , whereas , emission regions less than @xmath44 will be significantly magnified . for h  1413 + 117  with lens and source redshifts of 1.7 and 2.55 respectively , and assuming an isolated star , the einstein - ring radius on the source plane is @xmath44 @xmath2 2 @xmath19 10@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 cm .",
    "the observed enhancement of the fe  k@xmath43 line implies that the size of this iron line region is @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath44 . the enhanced fe  k@xmath0 emission observed in image a may be produced by microlensing of fe  k@xmath0 fluorescence from the far side of the outflow . assuming the murray et al .",
