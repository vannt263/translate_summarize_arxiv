    "the chemistry of water plays a crucial role in a wide range of processes in nature and technology ranging from enzymatic processes and the metabolism of living cells to acid - base reactions and proton transfer in hydrogen fuel cells .",
    "the theoretical study of these reactions is complicated by the fact that often water molecules act as reactants and products , as well as solvent .",
    "the archetypal example of such a complex reaction is autoionisation in liquid water . here , a water molecule dissociates forming a pair of hydronium and hydroxide ions that then separate determining the ph of water .",
    "the autoionisation reaction in liquid water has been studied in experiments from which the reaction rate constants for dissociation and recombination have been determined @xcite . while these experiments provided valuable information on the kinetics of the reaction , their space and time resolution was not sufficient to clarify the atomistic details of the reaction . in principle , this information can be extracted from molecular dynamics simulations with forces calculated ab intio via density functional theory .",
    "such simulations are , however , complicated by the widely disparate time scales present in the problem ; while the typical vibration frequency of oh bonds is of the order of tens of femtoseconds , it takes an intact water molecule about 10 hours to dissociate on average .",
    "this time scale problem has been recently overcome @xcite using a combination of car - parrinello molecular dynamics @xcite and transition path sampling @xcite .",
    "this approach , which does not require the definition of a reaction coordinate as in previous _ ab initio _ simulations of autoionisation @xcite , permits to concentrate on the reactive event and generate unbiased dissociation trajectories .",
    "analysis of such trajectories yielded the following reaction mechanism .",
    "the dissociation of the water molecule is initiated by a rare but strong electric field fluctuation generated by the surrounding water molecules .",
    "the nascent hydronium and hydroxide ions then separate along a chain of hydrogen bonds via grotthuss transfer events @xcite . when the hydrogen bond chain still connecting the two ions breaks , rapid recombination is prevented and from this state the ions can move apart further and separate completely .",
    "while these transition path sampling simulations produced a detailed and physically appealing picture of the dissociation process , they did not identify the origin of the electric field fluctuation involved in the first stages of the dissociation process .",
    "in particular , no local hydrogen bonding pattern or ion coordination number could account for the presence of the bond - breaking electric field fluctuation . also , it remained uncertain whether these electric fields , sufficiently strong to initiate the dissociation , stem from water molecules near the dissociating one or if long ranged effects are important .",
    "in this paper we study electric field fluctuations in liquid water using the tip4p model @xcite and investigate whether long - range electrostatics or specific local configurations are responsible for the strong but rare electric fields involved in the autoionisation process . in this particular model ,",
    "water molecules are treated as rigid and the electrostatic interactions between molecules are modeled by point charges placed on the molecules . since the model does not describe the cleavage and formation of covalent bonds , the dissociation event can not be studied directly .",
    "nevertheless , hydrogen bonds and long ranged electrostatic interactions are reproduced correctly such that information on the statistics of electric fields can be gleaned from our simulations .",
    "recently , electric field fluctuations have also been considered in the context of the vibrational spectroscopy of liquid water @xcite . in such experiments , vibrational frequencies , sensitive to the local molecular environment ,",
    "are used as probes for the dynamics of the hydrogen bond network percolating through the liquid . using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a perturbative treatment of a simplified model of the oh oscillator , geissler and collaborators @xcite",
    "have shown that the frequency of the oh - stretch of a hod molecule in liquid d@xmath0o almost perfectly correlates with the electric field acting on the hydrogen site .",
    "an analysis of the microscopic molecular configurations revealed that the strength of the electric field , and hence the frequency of the oh - stretch , is mainly determined locally by the geometry of the hod molecule with respect to the acceptor molecule ; other molecules from the first solvation shell play only a minor role . at short times ,",
    "vibrational decoherence is dominated by changes in this local geometry and only for longer times do collective density and polarization fluctuations , unrelated to specific molecular motions , determine the spectroscopic response .",
    "the remainder of this article is organised as follows . in sec .",

    "as we are interested in electric field contributions from remote hydration shells , we need to study systems with at least @xmath1 water molecules . currently ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "simulations with systems sizes of this magnitude are unfeasible , such that we have to resort to empirical water models . while such models do not describe bond breaking and forming , they capture effects due to long - ranged electrostatic interactions . in our simulations , we used the tip4p interaction potential @xcite , which reproduces the structure and dynamics of liquid water reasonably well , even compared to more recent potentials @xcite . the very good agreement between experiment and simulation obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the spectroscopic response of hod in liquid d@xmath0o , which is closely related to the statistics of electric fields , confirms the suitability of empirical potentials to model electric field fluctuations in liquid water .",
    "the tip4p model consists of four intermolecular interaction sites placed at fixed relative positions .",
    "two positive point charges are placed at the hydrogen atom centres and a compensating negative charge is placed on an extra point on the bisector of the hoh angle .",
    "in addition , a lennard - jones ( lj ) interaction site is placed at the oxygen site .",
    "the total intermolecular interaction potential for two tip4p water molecules @xmath2 and @xmath3 with respective charges @xmath4 and @xmath5 and whose oxygen atoms are separated by the distance @xmath6 , can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance between the charge @xmath9 on molecule @xmath2 and the charge @xmath10 on molecule @xmath3 .",

    "we have studied the distribution functions of the electric field , generated by solvent water molecules , on the centres of the oh bonds of a water molecule . in order to understand the origin of electric field fluctuations that are",
    "sufficiently strong to initiate the dissociation of a water molecule , we expressed the value of the electric field component along the bond as the sum of electric field contributions from charges in spherical shells around the centre of the oh bonds . by calculating the average shell contributions for different values of the observed field component",
    ", we were able to conclude that the relevant contributions come from shells at distances smaller than 7  , corresponding to charges on water molecules of the first and second hydration shell , even for the largest values of the electric field observed in the simulation .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism leading to the autoionisation of water does not involve long - ranged rearrangements in the liquid .",
    "indeed , particularly strong fields correlate with an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds to the molecule s neighbours and a higher number of hydrogen bonds being accepted than donated by the molecule on which the oh bond is considered .    since the electric field acting on the water molecule",
    "has been shown to be almost uniquely related to the frequency of the oh - stretch @xcite , exceptionally strong fields may be accessible to experimental probes .",
    "analysis of the respective molecular arrangements may then yield information on the likelihood of molecular patterns that drive chemical reactions through strong electric field fluctuations .",
    "all simulations discussed in this paper have been performed for rigid water molecules interacting via an empirical potential .",
    "the fields acting on a water molecule that is permitted to respond to the perturbation and actually undergo a dissociation are likely to be different from those reported here .",
    "this may be the reason why local hydrogen bond patterns are found to correlate with strong fields in our simulations , but not in ref . @xcite .",
    "further simulations with dissociable water molecules will be necessary to clarify this issue .",
    "such studies require an _ ab initio _ calculation of forces and are becoming feasible on current computer systems for moderate system sizes .",
