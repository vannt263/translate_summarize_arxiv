    "photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath9s ) save astronomers from expensive spectroscopy by determining redshifts from efficient broadband photometry .",
    "however , photo-@xmath9 precision can not compare to spectroscopic redshift precision .",
    "@xcite compare five state - of - the - art methods to determine redshifts from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometry .",
    "neural networks , which are non - linear regression tools , perform the best , but the rms error in the photo-@xmath9s is @xmath10 at best .",
    "this precision is sufficient to study large scale structure and some forms of redshift evolution , but not local environments @xcite , kinematic pairs , or the low - redshift luminosity function , where precise luminosities require precise redshifts . at a spectral resolution @xmath11 ,",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts in the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep2 ) galaxy redshift survey @xcite are many times more precise .",
    "repeat observations show redshift errors of @xmath12 , or velocity errors of @xmath13 .",
    "the expense of time - intensive spectroscopy demands a high rate of successfully determined redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , some spectra fail at providing redshifts .",
    "one of the most common redshift failures is the presence of only one emission line . ordinarily , recognizable patterns of emission or absorption lines uniquely determine the lines identities and hence rest wavelengths .",
    "spectroscopically precise observed wavelengths then give highly precise redshifts .",
    "an isolated emission line forms no recognizable pattern to reveal its identity and rest wavelength .",
    "recovering failed spectroscopic redshifts with broadband photometry has hardly been explored in the literature .",
    "@xcite assume all single emission lines in the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cfgrs ) are [ oii ] @xmath3 by arguing that any other line except ly@xmath0  would be accompanied by other emission lines .",
    "@xcite have identified single emission lines in canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) spectra based on the slope of the continuum surrounding the line .",
    "( unlike deep2 , both cfgrs and cfrs did not have the spectroscopic resolution to resolve the [ oii ] doublet , requiring them to make assumptions about the identities of single lines . )    in this paper , we also rely on the shape of the continuum , but we will show that broadband @xmath4 colors can determine the identity of single emission lines accurately , even for galaxies with no visible spectral continuum .",
    "the problem of an isolated emission line afflicts @xmath14 of deep2  targets , but the problem is more prevalent for serendipitously detected galaxies ( `` serendips '' ) that share a slit with target galaxies through a fortuitous position on the sky",
    ". recovery of redshifts from serendip spectra is important because serendips form an unbiased sample of galaxy spectra .",
    "we explore the problem through two methods .",
    "the parameter space proximity ( psp ) method identifies the redshift of a single - line galaxy by comparing its photometric magnitude and colors with those of galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the artificial neural network ( ann ) method employs the ann machine learning algorithm , which learns the functional relationship between any number of dependent and independent variables .",
    "they can determine photometric redshifts from relevant observable quantities such as colors , apparent magnitudes , and angular sizes .",
    "here , we use apparent magnitudes ( from which the ann determines colors ) and observed wavelengths of the single emission lines .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : data ] describes the deep2  survey and how single emission lines arise in its spectra ;  [ sec : methods ] describes the two methods for determining the identities of these single lines ;  [ sec : accuracy ] examines the accuracy of each method ;  [ sec : results ] presents the results of applying the methods to single emission lines ; and  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our work and discusses our future plans .",
    "the deep2  survey ( outlined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) combines @xmath4 photometry in four fields ( described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the cfht  @xmath15 mosaic camera and spectroscopy ( described by newman et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) from the deimos  spectrograph @xcite on the keck ii telescope .",
    "@xcite detail the deep2  target selection , based on the three - filter ( @xmath16 , @xmath7 , @xmath17 ) photometry .",
    "a color - color cut is applied to spectroscopy candidates in three of the four 120 @xmath18 deep2  fields to reduce as much as possible the number of spectra of @xmath19 galaxies .",
    "the remaining field ( field 1 ) has no such color - color selection .",
    "an apparent magnitude cut of @xmath20 is applied to all fields .",
    "furthermore , each spectroscopy target must be detected in @xmath16 , @xmath7 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the ` spec2d ` and ` spec1d ` software packages , written by the deep2  team , accomplish the deimos  spectroscopy reduction , including sky subtraction and an instrumental throughput correction to preserve actual line strengths .",
    "field 1 is unique in other ways as well .",
    "it overlaps the extended groth strip ( egs ) , which many different teams and instruments observe heavily .",
    "the wealth of photometry for the deep2  targets in field 1 permits very good photo-@xmath9 estimates ( huang et al .  2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "we plan to make use of the additional egs data in future work .",
    "however , in this paper , we use only the @xmath4 photometry in field 1 , and we treat it no differently from fields 2 - 4 .    astronomers from the deep2  team visually inspect every spectrum using the ` zspec ` script from the ` spec1d ` software package , designed by deep2  members .",
    "they assign spectra with at least two strong identifiable lines  such as an unblended [ oii ] doublet  a redshift quality code @xmath21 .",
    "spectra with one strong line and at least one weaker line receive @xmath22 .",
    "the entire survey contains 49,059 spectra . of them ,",
    "27,460 and 5,829 are @xmath21 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 category encompasses all failed redshifts that may be recovered with additional effort .",
    "the inspectors note the reason for all failures in this category , including the absence of all but one line .",
    "the spectral resolution of a deep2  spectrum is 1.4    fwhm , and the typical spectral range is about 6600    to 9200   .",
    "therefore , few redshifts permit both h@xmath0  @xmath25 and [ oiii ] @xmath1 or h@xmath2  @xmath26 to fall on the same spectrum . similarly , few redshifts permit both [ oiii ] or h@xmath2  and [ oii ] @xmath3 . consequently , most deep2  galaxies which are too faint to have a weaker emission line or a continuum with noticeable absorption lines display only one visible feature : h@xmath0 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath2 , or [ oii ] in emission .",
    "this feature is often the [ oii ] doublet , which is easily identifiable by its invariable @xmath27 peak separation as long as the galaxy s internal gas velocity dispersion does not broaden and blend both peaks .",
    "however , the feature may be a truly isolated single line , in which case the spectrum can not yield a unique redshift .",
    "lines may appear to be orphans if the signal - to - noise is low enough to permit only the brightest line to be seen .",
    "other weak lines may be lost in the noise of night sky lines , even with good sky subtraction .",
    "finally , a gap of @xmath28    separates the red and blue ccds in deimos , and any line in a pair of otherwise visible lines that falls completely in the gap will orphan its partner .",
    "we select all 984 redshift failures that result from a single emission line . after an additional visual inspection to remove spectra with marginally detected lines ,",
    "spectra mistakenly marked as having a single line , and spectra without any visible emission lines , our sample contains 640 single - line emission galaxies .",
    "we identify the pixel within the line that contains the most counts in the spectrum smoothed through a gaussian window function with @xmath29    and inverse variance weighting .",
    "we designate that pixel s observed wavelength as the wavelength of the single line .",
    "finally , we note whether the line is broad enough to be a blended [ oii ] doublet .",
    "for the purposes of identifying lines , it is not necessary to be more precise in determining the observed wavelength of the [ oii ] doublet than selecting the pixel with the most counts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the line identification methods presented here will fail at identifying the redshifts of composite galaxies , such as those blended together through lensing or line - of - sight coincidence .",
    "we assume that the broadband colors and magnitudes associated with all of the lines identified come from a single galaxy , and that composite colors and magnitudes will be distinct enough in parameter space that their associated single lines will not receive a conclusive identification .",
    "the bright lines most often visible in deep2  spectra are h@xmath0@xmath25 , [ oiii ] @xmath1 , h@xmath2  @xmath26 , and the [ oii ] @xmath30 , 3729 doublet . if any other line is visible , then one of these four is almost always visible as well .",
    "the @xmath16-band detection requirement eliminates the possibility of ly@xmath0 . on rare occasions , bright sky lines or the deimos  ccd gap may hide one of these four lines , leaving only one other dimmer line , such as [ oiii ] @xmath31 or h@xmath32  @xmath33 , visible . for this paper , we assume that any single emission line is one of the four bright lines .",
    "if a line is observed at @xmath34 , then we assume the galaxy s redshift is one of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or @xmath38 .",
    "we employ two independent methods , described below , to assign probabilities to the four possible line identities or redshifts : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . additionally , we set to zero the probabilities of lines that satisfy the following conditions :    1 .   if the line is observed bluer than @xmath43   , then @xmath44 . in other words , we do not permit blueshifts @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   of the @xmath22 and @xmath21 deep2  galaxies at redshifts",
    "where both h@xmath0  and h@xmath2  are accessible , 80% exhibit a balmer decrement of @xmath46 where the unit is spectral counts at the line peak .",
    "therefore , if the line is assumed to be h@xmath0 , and h@xmath2  also falls within the deimos  slit s spectral range , then @xmath44 if the smoothed spectral counts at the location of the single line are less than 2.6 or greater than 7.7 times the counts at the location of h@xmath2  within the errors of the photon counting statistics .",
    "3 .   similarly ,",
    "80% of @xmath22 and @xmath21 deep2  spectra with both [ oiii ] lines exhibit an [ oiii ] doublet ratio of @xmath47~\\lambda 5007/[{\\mathrm{o\\,\\mathsc{iii}}}]~\\lambda 4959 < 5.0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , if the line is assumed to be [ oiii ] @xmath1 and [ oiii ] @xmath31 should also be visible , then @xmath48 if the counts at the location of [ oiii ] @xmath1 are less than 1.6 or greater than 5.0 times the counts at the location of [ oiii ] @xmath31 within the errors of the photon counting statistics .",
    "the true physical ratio is always @xmath49~\\lambda    5007/[{\\mathrm{o\\,\\mathsc{iii}}}]~\\lambda 4959 = 3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "4 .   in 80% of @xmath22 and @xmath21 deep2  spectra with both [ oiii ] @xmath1 and h@xmath2 , @xmath50/{\\mathrm{h}\\beta } < 4.2 $ ]",
    "therefore , @xmath51 if @xmath49/{\\mathrm{h}\\beta } > 4.2 $ ] within the errors of the photon counting statistics .",
    "5 .   following condition",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath52 if @xmath53 within the errors of the photon counting statistics .",
    "6 .   following condition ( 4 ) , @xmath52 if @xmath54 > 1.6 $ ] within the errors of the photon counting statistics .",
    "if the line drops to no visible counts within a window smaller than @xmath27 , the velocity separation of the [ oii ] doublet , then @xmath55 because the line can not be dispersion - blended [ oii ] .",
    "conditions ( 2 ) through ( 6 ) rely on an 80% confidence interval , which may seem strict , but the large majority of the typically low signal - to - noise single lines pass these tests by virtue of their large photon counting errors .",
    "after all priors have been applied , we normalize the remaining probabilities @xmath56 such that their sum is unity .    in the language of photo-@xmath9s , both of the following techniques",
    "are `` training set '' methods , or empirical calibrations .",
    "training methods are immune to improper modeling and even incorrect photometric zero - point offsets .",
    "one weakness of training methods is that they require large training sets for their accuracy and precision to compare to that of modeling methods .",
    "another weakness is that they assume that the sample population properties are similar to the training set properties .",
    "for example , if single - line galaxies preferentially have lower metallicity and bluer colors than training set galaxies , then the methods described here will search a skewed region of parameter space . furthermore , a larger fraction of single - line galaxies show little or no continuum than training set galaxies , which may skew colors . for this paper ,",
    "we assume that the photometric properties of single - line galaxies are a subset of the photometric properties of training set galaxies , meaning that the parameter space around each single - line galaxy is well - populated by training set galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "both methods which assign probabilities to each of the four major lines require sets of galaxies with well - measured redshifts .",
    "the known - redshift set consists of deep2  targets with quality @xmath22 or @xmath57 spectroscopic redshifts and with at least one emission line detected at least @xmath58 above the noise .",
    "there are 20,676 such galaxies .",
    "we identify the emission line containing the pixel with the maximum counts in the spectrum smoothed in the same manner as the single - line galaxy spectra in  [ sec : sngls ] . for the remainder of the training process",
    ", we treat the spectrum as containing only that single line , but the redshift  and hence the identity of the single line  is known .",
    "inaccurate redshifts in the known - redshift set of course lead to inaccurate training and spurious line identification .",
    "repeat observations have shown that fewer than 4.5% of the 2,061 @xmath22 redshifts and fewer than 0.5% of the 18,615 @xmath21 redshifts are incorrect .",
    "therefore , the known - redshift set is less than 2% contaminated by incorrect redshifts .",
    "both of the following methods assume that the training set galaxies populate the same observable parameter space as true single - line galaxies . the different target selection functions between field 1 ( 6,532 galaxies ) and",
    "fields 2 - 4 ( 14,144 galaxies ) make this point especially important .",
    "the underrepresentation of @xmath19 galaxies , which are present almost exclusively in field 1 , decreases the certainty at which @xmath19 galaxies may be identified .",
    "however , as long as @xmath19 single - line galaxies populate a region of parameter space distinct from @xmath59 galaxies , and as long as @xmath19 training set galaxies also populate that region , the following algorithms should not mistake low - redshift galaxies for high - redshift ones .",
    "therefore , we combine galaxies from all fields into one training set . we have also analyzed both methods with field segregation .",
    "we tested field 1 galaxies using a training set with only field 1 galaxies , and we tested fields 2 - 4 galaxies using a training set with only fields 2 - 4 galaxies .",
    "the accuracy was statistically indifferent from using a unified training set , but the number of conclusively identified galaxies decreased slightly .",
    "we randomly divide the known - redshift set into training and evaluation subsets .",
    "the latter plays no role in the training , and we invoke it only in  [ sec : accuracy ] . a larger training set yields higher precision whereas a larger evaluation set provides more confident tests of the method .",
    "we find that diverting 20% of the known - redshift set into the evaluation set , leaving 80% for the training set , gives a significant , untouched sample by which to judge performance without significantly affecting precision .",
    "the survey s three available broadband filter measurements , @xmath16 , @xmath7 , and @xmath17 , permit photo-@xmath9 measurements . because emission line galaxies in different redshift ranges form different loci in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 space , a single galaxy s position in that plane gives a guess at its redshift .",
    "the two colors alone provide enough information to determine some line identities , but adding @xmath7 apparent magnitude increases the number of identifications by @xmath60 . observed wavelength also provides discriminatory power because both the single line s observed wavelength and the galaxy s broadband colors are functions of redshift .",
    "we assign an identification confidence parameter @xmath61 for each single - line galaxy , represented by index @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 represents one of the bright lines .",
    "roughly , the confidence parameter is a measure of distances from the point of the sample galaxy to each point in the training set in parameter space .",
    "more or closer points give a higher @xmath61 , and fewer or farther points give a lower @xmath61 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : methoda ] for a simplified representation of this method .",
    "more precisely , every point in the training set is assigned a four - dimensional gaussian .",
    "each of the four axes corresponds to one observable : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the width of the gaussian for each of the three color and magnitude observables is given by the sum in quadrature of the photometric error for the training set galaxy @xmath66 and the photometric error of the single - line galaxy @xmath62 .",
    "the wavelength gaussian is unique because it distinguishes between the four line identities .",
    "each galaxy in the training set has four wavelength gaussians , each corresponding to one of the four possible line identities , represented by @xmath63 .",
    "the wavelength at the peak of gaussian @xmath63 is @xmath67 , where @xmath9 is the known redshift of the training set galaxy and @xmath68 is the rest wavelength of one of the four lines .",
    "the width of this gaussian is the sum in quadrature of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the error in the redshift from the ` spec1d ` spectral template cross - correlation , and 106   , the median value of @xmath71 for the evaluation set .",
    "the factor of 1000 is necessary to widen the gaussians so that they actually overlap .",
    "it was chosen to optimize accuracy , but the results are very insensitive to the precise value .",

    "[ eq : sigmabr ] and [ eq : sigmari ] suggest , we use the error simply to broaden the gaussians . additionally , the gaussians of galaxies with larger photometric errors will contribute less to @xmath61 because they will have larger widths but the same volume .",

    "this normalization makes the gaussian prefactor of @xmath74 unnecessary .",
    "thus , @xmath61 represents the probability that the identity of the single emission line in spectrum @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "the criterion for a conclusive line identification is that @xmath61 for a certain line @xmath63 exceeds @xmath75 , a tunable parameter .",
    "a larger @xmath75 will yield fewer conclusive line identifications , but a larger fraction of them will be correct .. therefore , increasing @xmath75 imposes a stricter condition on precision , thereby increasing accuracy . ]    because [ oiii ] @xmath1 and h@xmath2  @xmath26 always fall so close to each other in wavelength , it is very difficult to discriminate between them .",
    "however , it is possible to rule out h@xmath0and [ oii ] if @xmath76 .",
    "additionally , conditions ( 3 ) through ( 6 ) described above may rule out either [ oiii ] @xmath1 or h@xmath2 , leaving only one possibility .",
    "an artificial neural network ( ann ) can learn the functional relationship between certain elements in a data set and derived properties of the same set .",
    "the first major implementation of anns in astronomy was galaxy morphological classification @xcite , but presently , the most common ann implementation is photometric redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "anns are more precise than other machine learning methods ( e.g. , trained decision tree classifiers , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and model - independent , in contrast to template fitting methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . given a set of photometric data , such as broadband filter measurements",
    ", an ann can estimate a redshift and the error on that redshift .",
    "this process requires a very large training set for accurate and precise results .",
    "typically , a large known - redshift set with broadband data and spectroscopic redshifts is divided randomly into three independent sets : training , validation , and evaluation .",
    "( in this paper , we divide the known - redshift set into 60% training , 20% validation , and 20% evaluation to balance the precision a large training set affords with the ability to test the ann on an evaluation set . )",
    "the ann learns the dependence of redshift on photometric observables from the training set and interactively verifies its accuracy with the validation set . after training and validation",
    "are complete , the ann configuration is fixed and unchangeable . at this point",
    ", the evaluation set can test how well the ann has been trained ( see  [ sec : accuracy ] ) .",
    "finally , the ann may be applied to data without spectroscopic redshifts to obtain photometric redshifts with an accuracy comparable to that achieved with the evaluation set .    in determining single emission line identity",
    ", we employ an ann with a four - component output , using the publicly available code ann@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "each output corresponds to the probability of a line identification . during training , the brightest line in the spectrum of a galaxy of known redshift",
    "is assigned a probability of 1 while the other probabilities are 0 .",
    "in addition to providing @xmath16 , @xmath7 , and @xmath17 measurements as input to the ann , we also provide the wavelength of the single line .",
    "although there is danger in using irrelevant data as input to an ann , we justify the use of line wavelength by remarking that the redshift and hence @xmath4 magnitudes and colors of a galaxy would be different if the single line were h@xmath0  at observed wavelength @xmath77 rather than a different @xmath78 . in full detail , the ann architecture is 4:4:4:4 , meaning 4 inputs , 4 outputs , and 2 hidden layers with 4 nodes each , shown diagrammatically in fig .",

    "we find that other similar architectures do not affect line identification significantly .    in determining the functional relationship between inputs and outputs",
    ", an ann finds the optimal configuration of weights to connect each node .",
    "before training begins , the ann is initialized with random weights .",
    "for this reason , anns with the same architecture and same training sets but with different initializations will usually find different local minima .",
    "the solution is to use the average of the results of a committee of separately initialized anns .",
    "we use committees of 20 anns identical in every way except for their initially randomized weights .    in analogy to the psp method",
