    "plasma boundary layers are often thought to be laminar regions in which ions are accelerated through a presheath to a speed exceeding the ion sound speed @xmath1 at the sheath edge  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that under certain discharge conditions the ion flow may not be laminar , but instead excite electrostatic instabilities in the presheath . in particular ,",
    "ion - acoustic instabilities are expected under conditions of low neutral pressure and large electron - to - ion temperature ratio ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "if two different species of positive ions are present , ion - ion two - stream instabilities can also be expected under similar conditions  @xcite .",
    "this work provides a characterization of the stability boundaries for each of these , which can be used as a practical guide to determine the experimental conditions at which the instabilities are expected to arise in presheaths .",
    "these flow - driven instabilities have been predicted to affect transport in various ways . at common low temperature plasma conditions , ionization and charge exchange collisions typically cause a slow tail to form in the ion velocity distribution function ( ivdf ) as ions flow through the presheath  @xcite . for single ion species plasmas ,",
    "the ion - acoustic instability has been predicted to increase the ion - ion collision rate through wave - particle scattering , causing the ivdf to thermalize as it nears the sheath edge  @xcite .",
    "the ion - acoustic instabilities have similarly been proposed to enhance electron scattering , providing a possible explanation for langmuir s paradox  @xcite . in ionic mixtures , ion - ion two - stream instabilities",
    "have been predicted to rapidly enhance the ion - ion friction force , preventing the differential ion flow speed ( @xmath2 ) from significantly exceeding the threshold value for instability onset @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "this condition , along with the two - species bohm criterion , was proposed to determine the speed of each ion species at the sheath edge .",
    "aspects of each of these predictions have since been tested experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a review of the current status of this validation effort , along with an analysis of instability threshold conditions that will aid in the design and analysis of future experiments .",
    "the basic physics of instabilities affecting transport near boundaries may have important consequences in various applications .",
    "for instance , the form of the ivdf at the sheath edge is important in materials processing because it influences the energy of ions striking a material surface .",
    "it can also influence global plasma models for mixtures because the predicted instability - enhanced friction between ions can influence the relative fluxes of each species exiting a plasma  @xcite .",
    "this in turn influences the steady - state concentrations of each species in the bulk plasma .",
    "in addition to the presheath flow driven instabilities discussed here , other instances of similar electrostatic instabilities have been found in the plasma boundary layer .",
    "for instance , when surfaces emit secondary electrons they are accelerated through the ion sheath and can generate instabilities  @xcite .",
    "sheath - induced instabilities can be excited in @xmath4 discharges  @xcite , and finite length and boundary effects of the ion - acoustic instabilities can also be significant  @xcite .",
    "it has also recently been shown that electron sheaths have a presheath that accelerates electrons to the thermal speed at the sheath edge  @xcite .",
    "this strong electron flow has been observed in 2d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to drive large - amplitude ion - acoustic instabilities in the electron presheath .",

    "the dominant wavelength is found to be a few debye lengths ( @xmath53 ) for the unstable region of a presheath .",

    ", the group speed of the fastest growing mode typically varies from ( 0.4 - 0.8@xmath36 ) through the presheath .",
    "the ionization fraction in low - temperature plasmas is often on the order of a few percent and ion - neutral collisions can be an important process affecting transport .",
    "in fact , the presheath length scale is often determined by the ion - neutral collision mean free path  @xcite . with regard to ion - acoustic instabilities , which are longitudinal waves in the ion fluid ,",
    "these collisions cause an energy sink that damps the waves .",
    "this reduces the instability growth rate and , when the collision rate is sufficiently high , can completely suppress the instabilities .",

    "ion - neutral collisions often influence the ivdf in a presheath .",
    "typically this takes the form of a non - thermal tail extending from the flowing distribution to low energy  @xcite .",
    "several theories have been developed , starting with the seminal work of tonks and langmuir  @xcite , to quantify the ivdf in this region .",
    "accurate models are important for many applications .",
    "this is especially so in materials processing because it influences the energy distribution of ions striking a material .",
    "it was recently predicted that if ion - acoustic instabilities arise in a presheath , wave - particle scattering can influence the ivdf  @xcite . in particular , the excitation of these weakly growing instabilities from the natural thermal fluctuations leads to an effective enhancement of the ion - ion coulomb collision rate  @xcite .",
    "this led to the prediction of a three - stage presheath with regard to the behavior of the ivdf  @xcite : ( 1 ) at the entrance , the ivdf is the bulk plasma distribution , which is often a maxwellian , ( 2 ) as ions stream through the presheath and collide with neutrals or are produced by ionization , a non - thermal distribution forms that is flow - shifted and also has a tail extending to low energies , ( 3 ) if there is a region of ion - acoustic instabilities close to the sheath edge , the enhanced scattering causes the ivdf to thermalize to a flow - shifted maxwellian near the sheath edge .",
    "the prediction that the wave - particle scattering thermalizes the distribution relies on the assumption that the amplitude of the fluctuations remains low enough that the dielectric response of the plasma is linear .",
    "if this case , one can consider the interaction between charged particles to occur via a dielectrically `` dressed '' coulomb potential that includes the growing modes .",
    "the result is an enhanced collision rate , but other properties of standard coulomb collisions , such as a unique maxwellian equilibrium , are expected to hold  @xcite .",
    "recently , an experimental test of the three - stage presheath prediction was carried out using laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) in a xenon plasma  @xcite .",
    "measurements were consistent with the prediction at sufficiently low neutral pressure . by varying the neutral pressure and electron temperature",
    ", the pressure - temperature threshold for the thermalization near the sheath edge was measured using a criterion for the degree to which the ivdf can be considered maxwellian .",
    "this was compared to a theoretical prediction based on an equation similar to equation  ( [ eq : iapressure ] ) .",
    "the experiment was consistent with the prediction and clearly measured the predicted @xmath83 scaling .",
    "kinetic vlasov simulations have also been carried out to analyze the ivdf in the sheath and presheath  @xcite .",
    "this work showed that collisionless bunching associated with the acceleration of ions through a sheath and presheath also causes the ivdf to become more localized and therefore appear thermalized .",
    "future work is needed to understand , and distinguish , the combined effects of collisionless bunching and instability - enhanced collisions near the sheath edge .",
    "since the ion sheath is very thin compared to the electron collision length scale in the vast majority of plasmas , it is nominally expected that the electron velocity distribution function ( evdf ) near the sheath is severely depleted in the velocity phase - space region corresponding to electrons that traverse the ion sheath and escape to the boundary .",
    "however , some of the first measurements ever conducted in plasmas revealed that this region of velocity phase - space contained vastly more electrons than could be expected on theoretical grounds based on coulomb collisions  @xcite .",
    "this measurement of anomalous electron scattering has come to be known as langmuir s paradox  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that ion - acoustic instabilities can enhance electron scattering in the presheath region  @xcite .",
    "the same instability - enhanced collision operator discussed in the context of ion - ion scattering in the previous section  @xcite was also evaluated for electron - electron scattering the presence of ion - acoustic instabilities .",
    "the maximum collision rate enhancement in this kinetic theory occurs at velocities that are resonant with the phase speed of the wave . for electrons ,",
    "the ion - acoustic speed is much less than the electron thermal speed , so the resonant region of phase - space is near the bulk of the distribution .",
    "the non - thermal region of interest near a sheath is in the tail of the distribution , which is far from this resonance .",
    "nevertheless , the theory predicts that if the instabilities grow sufficiently in the presheath , they can significantly enhance scattering reaching even into the tail .",
    "the collision frequency scales with velocity approximately as @xmath84 from the resonant location .",
    "this is the same scaling that standard coulomb collisions have referenced from the zero of the relative velocity vector @xmath85 ( which is also near the bulk of the distribution ) .",
    "thus , the instabilities enhance the coulomb collision rate , but do not substantially change how it scales with velocity .",
    "the ion - acoustic instability boundaries discussed in the previous section determine when this affect might be expected to arise in low - temperature plasmas . unfortunately , there is a dearth of experimental , or simulation , data to compare with the theory . a recent experiment by godyak measured signficant depletion in the tail of the electron energy distribution function in argon discharges in the mtorr neutral pressure range  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fg : ia_pressure ] suggests that ion - acoustic instabilities would be damped in the presheath for this pressure .",
    "there is a great need for more experiments and simulations to understand electron scattering near sheaths .",
    "the stability boundaries provided here may contribute to determining when ion - acoustic instabilities can be expected to affect transport in this region .",

    "if ions are not collisionally coupled , it is nominally expected that each ion species obtains the same kinetic energy in response to falling through the presheath potential drop , @xmath124 . in this case , the solution of equation  ( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) is that each ion species obtains the individual sound speed at the sheath edge @xmath125 and @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath127 two - stream instabilities are expected to arise in the presheath . in this case , the differential flow speed is expected to be @xmath112 .",
    "thus , a condition @xmath128 was suggested as a criterion that , along with equation  ( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) , determines the speed of each ion species at the sheath edge  @xcite .",
    "the combination of equations  ( [ eq : bohm2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dvc ] ) led to the prediction that there is a significant concentration dependence on the speed of ions at the sheath edge . at conditions of @xmath0 , the speed of each species",
    "is predicted to approach the common system sound speed @xmath36 when @xmath129 , and trend toward the individual sound speeds ( @xmath130 ) for dilute mixtures  @xcite . for mixtures with large mass ratios",
    ", this can lead to a significant variation in the ion speed at the sheath edge as the concentration varies .",
    "for example , in he@xmath31-xe@xmath31 at typically experimental conditions the he@xmath31 speed changes by a factor of 2 .",
    "several detailed tests of the predicted speeds have been conducted experimentally using laser - induced fluorescence including ar - xe discharges and he - xe discharges  @xcite .",
    "these have shown excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted ion speeds , and have shown fluctuation measurements consistent with ion - ion two - stream instabilities  @xcite .",
    "recent pic simulations have also shown similar agreement with the predicted ion speeds , and have also provided a detailed analysis of both the fluctuation spectrum near the sheath edge and the profile of friction in comparison to other terms of the ion momentum balance equation  @xcite .",
    "both of these also agree with the expectations of the theory .",
    "other pic simulations in mixtures have been conducted at conditions where two - stream instabilities are not predicted to occur in the presheath  @xcite ( see @xcite for an analysis of the stability conditions ) . in both of these cases , the ion speeds were observed to be the individual sound speed at the sheath edge , which is also consistent with the theory .",
    "these experiments and simulations were conducted at low pressure , well below the thresholds indicated in figure  [ fg:2s_pressure ] ( with the exception of @xcite , which was conducted at higher pressure , but this was also expected to be in a stable regime based on the temperature ratio in the simulation ) .",
    "no study has yet been conducted to explicitly test the pressure stability boundary .",
    "standard linear electrostatic stability theory , which has been validated in many contexts , predicts that the ion flow through a presheath can excite instabilities under the conditions of low neutral pressure and large electron - to - ion temperature ratio @xmath0 .",
    "although much has been done to quantify the stability boundaries for conditions relevant to low temperature plasmas , and several of the predicted transport effects have been tested experimentally , much remains to be done .",
    "this includes theoretical development to further understand the parameter regimes at which instability can be expected , as well as how the instabilities affect transport and how the change in transport might influence applications .",
    "further experimental and simulation tests are required to validate these predictions .    for single ion species plasmas ,",
    "the major research need is a measurement or simulation showing the presence of ion - acoustic instabilities in parameter regime predicted to be unstable .",
    "there is currently no such direct measurement .",
    "only the indirect effect of the predicted ion thermalization has been measured  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "further developments are needed to understand how ion - neutral collisions damp the instability .",
    "a simple model based on a constant collision frequency was provided here , but it is unclear how accurate this is , especially for charge - exchange collisions .",
    "this may significantly influence the stability boundaries .",
    "further analysis is also required to validate the predicted enhancement of electron scattering .    for binary ionic mixtures , much analysis and experimental validation has already been completed .",
    "a primary research need going forward is a detailed analysis and validation of the neutral pressure threshold .",
    "this is important since discharges span a broad range of neutral pressures , extending across the estimated boundaries shown in figure  [ fg:2s_pressure ] .",
    "it will also be important to establish how the predicted change in ion flow speed at the sheath edge affects plasma modeling in different situations , such as global models  @xcite or models of plasma - materials interactions . although the speed predicted by the instability - enhanced friction theory can differ substantially from the traditional individual sound speed prediction , it is still unknown if this has significant practical implications .",
