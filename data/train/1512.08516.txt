    "study of spectra of quasars is difficult because usual spectroscopy which uses transitions between energy levels does not work .",
    "burbidge @xcite , then karlsson @xcite found an empirical formula on redshifts of selected quasars , formula which is transformed in section [ disc ] , so that its empirical parameter ( karlsson s constant ) appears connected to lyman spectrum of h atom .",
    "subsection [ mod1 ] applies transformed formula to spectral frequencies , correlating them .",
    "it appears that light is redshifted when lyman @xmath0 line is absorbed , while visible absorption of gas lines requires a stop of redshift which occurs if there remains no energy at lyman @xmath0 frequency .",
    "remarkable redshifts 3k or 4k ( where k is karlsson s constant 0.061 ) show that redshifts stop if absorbed lines ly@xmath1 or ly@xmath2 reach @xmath3 frequency . thus we suppose that atoms in state 2p produce a redshift , so that a lack of these atoms allows an absorption of intense , sharp lines .    in [ mod1 ] , these remarks are used to build a set of spectral lines .    in [ struc ] , space is divided into spherical shells around star , absorbing ( thus redshifting ) or not light at local lyman @xmath0 frequency",
    ".    in section [ flash ] , gas in a redshifting shell may lose , during a short time , its excitation by emission of a superradiant beam , so that a sharp absorbed line appears .",
    "section [ isrs ] , shows how impulsive stimulated raman scatterings ( isrs ) redshifts light .",
    "burbidge @xcite , then karlsson @xcite observed that relative frequency shifts of spectral lines of quasars z = [ @xmath4 / \\nu_{obsv}$ ] are often close to remarkable values @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this result was generalized by karlsson s formula :    @xmath7 , ( 1 )    where n is integer 3 , 4 , 6 , ... and k=0.061 .",
    "many sharp , saturated lines making `` lyman forests '' of quasar obey these rules ; many authors tried to apply similar formula to galaxies , but it failed .",
    "as his formula does not work well for large @xmath8 , karlsson proposed a periodicity of ln(1+z ) , additions of which multiplies sets of frequencies by parameters , as doppler redshifts do , without very good results .",
    "an aim of this paper is extension of karlsson s work to understand formation of lyman forests \" of quasars .",
    "we use mainly conventions and results found in p. petitjean s paper @xcite , also rauch s ideas @xcite .      in doppler frequency shifts , emitted and received frequencies verify equation which involves , as parameters , emission and reception speeds @xmath9 and @xmath10 :    @xmath11 ( 2 )",
    "we assume that frequency shifts at various light frequencies obey an equation similar to equation ( 2 ) , so that a single parameter is needed to compute frequency shifts at all frequencies , for instance the ratio @xmath12 of a particular shifted frequency over initial frequency :    @xmath13 ( 3 )    the terms of strange serie 3 , 4 , 6 , ... of karlsson s formula may be written @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are any non - negative integers .",
    "thus redshifts @xmath17 and @xmath18 are remarkable , able to generate simply all karlsson s redshifts",
    ".    compute redshifts which put lyman @xmath19 and @xmath20 frequencies of h atom to @xmath3 frequency :    @xmath21/(1 - 1/22 ) ] \\approx 5/27 \\approx 0.1852 \\approx 3 * 0.0617 \\approx 3*k ; $ ] ( 4 )    @xmath22[(1 - 1/42 -(1 - 1/22)]/(1 - 1/22 ) ] = 1/4 = 0,25 = 4 * 0.0625 @xmath23 .",
    "( 5 )    assuming that use of 3 lowest lyman frequencies of h atom is better than use of k , and that variation of shifts at various frequencies is obtained from a particular shift as in a doppler redshift , karlsson s formula becomes simpler : shifted frequencies @xmath24 depend only on absolute frequency @xmath25 , three well known frequencies and two any non - negative integers @xmath15 and @xmath16 :    @xmath26 . ( 6 )    karlsson s formula ( 1 ) , applied , for instance , to lyman beta line with n=3 does not generate exactly lyman alpha frequency , while formula ( 6 ) does . though resolution of spectra does not allow to distinguish a doublet from a superposition of lines",
    ", we will choose formula ( 6 ) because choice of possible values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 seems more natural than extraction of @xmath8 from a less natural serie .",
    "is it only aesthetics ?",
    "we assume that `` lyman forest '' is built by absorption of a thermal emission of an extremely hot star by _",
    "pure _ , relatively cold ( 2 000 - 50 000 k ) , low pressure , non - excited , atomic hydrogen .    following properties of many lines of `` lyman forest ''",
    "are directly deduced from petitjean s paper @xcite :    -a- as lines are sharp , widening of lines by collisions must be negligible , pressure of gas must be very low .",
    "-b- to obtain absorption of lyman lines at several frequencies , a redshift process of electromagnetic waves is necessary . here",
    ", we make only hypothesis of formula ( 3 ) about this redshift .",
    "-c- a single , unshifted ly@xmath1 is observed ; no unshifted ly@xmath2 appears because it does not remain absorbable energy at high frequencies after redshifts of thermal emission profile .",
    "absence of an absorption line may result from :    -a- absence of emitted energy around frequency of line .",
    "-b- a permanent shift of light frequencies dilutes absorption , so that all absorbed ( or emitted ) lines have width of shift and lines are weak , not observable .",
    "accordingly , absorption ( or emission ) of sharp lines requires a stop of frequency shifts .",
    "-c- accurate superposition of observed lines results from the choice of redshift equations : absence of shifted @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines while sharp @xmath0 lines are observed , is due to superposition of these lines with @xmath0 lines .",
    "in standard theory , sharpness of saturated absorbed lines requires contradictory conditions :    - column density of gas must be large for saturation ;    - absorbing gas must be thin to avoid a broadening of lines by frequency shift during absorption",
    ".    - pressure of gas must be low to avoid collisional broadening of line .",
    "thus gas must be in filaments which are only detected on paths from quasars .    supposing that redshift is related to a physical property of gas , condition is :    - light is redshifted except if an absorbed line is at lyman @xmath0 frequency .",
    "thus redshift requires a lyman @xmath0 absorption , that is generation of 2p atomic hydrogen .",
    "figure 1 represents a canvas of atomic hydrogen spectrum for building any absorption spectrum by addition of lines , in particular able to play the role of @xmath29 or @xmath30 lines .",
    "[ spectre ]     rules used to build spectrum taking into account only hydrogen atoms are simple :    - i - at start , close to star , we suppose that @xmath31 and @xmath28 lines have been absorbed .",
    "- ii - it appears a frequency shift until an absorbed , shifted line of initial frequency @xmath32 reaches @xmath3 frequency .",
    "thus all absorbed frequencies have been multiplied by @xmath33 , coefficent lower than 1 . in pure atomic hydrogen @xmath32",
    "may be @xmath19 or @xmath20 , assuming that higher frequency lines are too weak .",
    "- iii - during stop of frequency shift , the three main lines of h could be absorbed , but there remain no energy at ly@xmath34 frequency .",
    "- iv - assume that ly@xmath1 absorption produces a very weak redshift .",
    "during this negligible redshift , gas lines are visibly absorbed .",
    "if weak redshift is able to shift absorbed frequencies off ly@xmath34 absorption line before full absorption of light at ly@xmath1 frequency , fast redshift restarts , go to - ii - .",
    "else there is no more redshift , absorbed ly@xmath1 line is visible , but ly@xmath2 line is probably not because its frequency is probably larger than the shifted high frequency limit of emission of star .    in pure h , total redshift results from several relative shifts z@xmath35 and z@xmath36 which correspond to multiplication of light frequencies by @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "computed lower frequencies written on figure are not very good .",
    "they can be corrected by multiplication by a unique dispersion function @xmath39 equal to 1 at @xmath3 frequency .",
    "lines found in figure 1 appear in real spectra , after a correction of their frequencies by the factor @xmath39 .",
    "but many lines have an other origin : various lines absorbed at frequencies larger than @xmath3 may play the role of ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath2 , multiplying density of lines .    figures much more complex than fig .",
    "1 can be drawn .",
    "redshifts stop if frequency of an absorbed line becomes @xmath3 and not if absorbed @xmath20 frequency reaches @xmath19 frequency .",
    "this shows that redshift results on generation of 2p hydrogen atoms .    up to now",
    ", we have only supposed that it exists somewhere ( sometime for light ) a redshift .",
    "thus , assuming that quasar is far from other stars , space is divided into spherical shells where generated 2p atoms shift light frequencies , and shells in which there is no 2p atoms and no frequency shifts .",
    "as quasars are not alone in space , perturbation of generation of these regions may result from pumpings of atoms by light of other stars .",
    "thus region in which quantized redshifts appear must be small enough to avoid an important lighting by other stars : this explains burbidge s selection of quasars .    to avoid different pumpings by light coming from different regions of surface of the star , redshift must appear only at a distance much larger than size of the star , that is in a region where pressure of gas is low .",
    "these conditions are evidently not verified for a set of relatively close stars as a galaxy .",
    "as the star must produce very high light frequencies , if it is small it must be extremely hot .",
    "an hypothesis which seems valuable is an accreting neutron star , a type of stars which were never found in nebulae while they should be seen .",
    "in model described in [ mod1 ] , we obtained spherical shells of hydrogen atoms either excited by absorption of lyman @xmath3 frequency , or in ground state .",
    "but it is difficult to obtain the large number of lines observed for instance between ly@xmath34 and ly@xmath1 lines ( ly@xmath34 forest ) .    in [ struc ]",
    ", we took only ito account the lack of absorption at @xmath3 frequency to explain stops of redshifts .",
    "but , in spherical shells in which @xmath3 frequency is absorbed , einstein s b coefficient of amplification at @xmath3 may become large because temperature of exciting light is large and there are almost no collisions to de - excite atoms .",
    "thus , lyman alpha coherent , superradiant flash emissions may burst , into directions almost orthogonal to exciting rays , for which path in a spherical shell is maximum . the flash pumps energy from atoms and",
    "light which excites them , so that an absorption line appears in spectrum .",
    "these transfers of energy are in agreement with thermodynamics because energy flows from hot beams comming from star to resulting beams stemming from dark infinity through flash , radiance of which is average .",
    "the result is a sharp absorption at current frequency .",
    "it is difficult to discuss on stability of relaxation oscillations which generate these absorptions , thus on stability of spectra .",
    "however , the medium is probably much more homogeneous and stable than the medium which provides aurora borealis , similar to permanently superradiant media which provide punctuated or not circles around strmgren spheres , possibly transformed by planets into hourglasses as in snr1987a .",
    "a computation of this spectrum seems very difficult , requiring a lot of hypothesis .",
    "in 1s state , hydrogen has 1420 mhz hyperfine frequency , ( period t=0.7ns ; wavelength @xmath40 = 21 cm ) , quadrupolar resonance frequency .    in its first excited state",
    ", hydrogen atom has quadrupolar resonance frequencies : 178 mhz ( t=5.6 ns , @xmath40 = 1,7 m ) in state 2s@xmath41 , 59 mhz ( t=17 ns , @xmath40 = 5 m ) in 2p@xmath41 and 24 mhz ( t=42 ns , @xmath40 = 12 m ) in 2p@xmath42 .    a qualitative difference between laboratory and space isrs is that ordinary incoherent light is made of longer , around 1 nanosecond pulses : these pulses must be shorter than hyperfine periods in excited states , as required by conditions of space coherence of `` impulsive stimulated raman scattering '' ( isrs ) : _ length of pulses must be shorter than all involved time constants _ @xcite",
    ".    space coherence of incident and scattered light in isrs allows an interference of exciting and scattered light , which shifts frequency of incident light and preserves the geometry of light beams .",
    "the other condition for isrs is : collisional time must be longer than 1ns , that is pressure must be very low , so that pressure broadening of lines is low .",
    "these conditions make isrs in space very weak compared with isrs in labs of chemistry , which uses around 10 nanosecond laser pulses , around @xmath43 times shorter than light pulses of temporally incoherent light :    - division of pressure by k divides the shift by k.    - division of quadrupolar frequency by k divides the shift by k twice :    - - once mixing incident and raman frequency shifted of hyperfine frequency ;    - - once by division of difference of populations of hyperfine levels , assuming thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus order of magnitude of path needed to observe isrs is @xmath44 times longer than in laboratory experiments : astronomical paths are needed for observation .",
    "as pressure is very low , collisions between atoms are negligible .",
    "a radiative process is necessary to de - excite hyperfine levels , thus obtain raman frequency shift .    happily , there are cold background electromagnetic waves .",
    "thus , the real process is not a single isrs , but a set of isrs such that hyperfine levels of 2p atoms are not excited .",
    "excited atoms h catalyze an exchange of energy between light beams , it is a _ parametric interaction_. variations of energy produce frequency shifts of light beams , so that their entropy is increased .",
    "this parametric interaction is usually named `` coherent raman effects between incoherent light beams '' ( creil ) .",
    "study of lyman forests of quasars is difficult because they mix spectra origins of which are different , although all visibly absorbed lines are sharp and saturated :    - karlsson s relative frequency shifts 3k or 4k transform , shift , with a good approximation , absorbed lyman frequencies @xmath19 or @xmath20 of h atom into @xmath3 frequency . during corresponding frequency shifts ,",
    "h atoms are pumped to 2p level by permanent , diluted , invisible @xmath45 absorption .",
    "- fast , superradiant de - excitation of 2p atoms by emission of a superradiant flash absorbs light at @xmath3 frequency , during a relaxation process .",
    "burbidge and karlsson selected quasars in which few lines have this origin to obtain their results .",
    "stop of redshift which allows saturated , visible absorption of lines is due to lack of 2p atoms .",
    "this lack may result from flash , coherent de - excitation of 2p levels , or to presence of an absorbed line at @xmath45 frequency . in this last case",
    ", redshift may remain very weak by @xmath29 absorption , until absorbed line is shifted out of @xmath45 frequency , so that fast redshift restarts ...    additional absorptions by various atoms may also play the role of lyman @xmath27 and @xmath28 absorptions , complicating the spectrum .",
    "comparison of theoretical and observed spectra shows a small shift increasing at lowest frequencies , because , as refraction , isrs has a dispersion which was not taken into account .",
