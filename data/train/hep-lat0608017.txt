    "for lattice field theories with fermions , and in particular for lattice qcd , where there exists a local action describing the dynamics with the desired number of fermion flavours , the preferred simulation method is the hybrid monte - carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the hmc augments a hybrid molecular - dynamics update with a discrete ` time ' step ( @xmath0 ) , with a global accept / reject step at the end of each trajectory .",
    "this accept / reject step makes the algorithm exact , removing all @xmath0 dependence from measured observables .    for staggered and improved staggered fermions with numbers of flavours which are not multiples of 4 and for other fermion schemes with odd numbers of flavours",
    ", there is no local action , and one needs to take fractional powers of the fermion determinant . until recently , simulations of such theories used hybrid molecular - dynamics simulations with ` noisy ' fermions , usually the r algorithm ( hmd(r ) ) @xcite .",
    "the problem is that in hmd(r ) simulations , the observables depend on @xmath0 , the leading departure from the desired @xmath2 results being @xmath3 .",
    "hence one should either simulate at several ( small ) @xmath0 values and extrapolate to @xmath2 , or perform simulations at such a small @xmath0 value that the @xmath3 errors are negligible .    in the rhmc algorithm @xcite , instead of taking fractional powers of the determinant of the quadratic dirac operator ,",
    "one takes fractional powers of the operator itself .",
    "this defines an action ( nonlocal ) and thus permits a global accept / reject step .",
    "since the quadratic dirac operator is positive definite , such fractional powers are well defined in terms of the eigenmodes of the operator . to make this algorithm practical",
    ", one needs approximations to the fractional powers of the eigenvalues , which can be applied directly to matrices .",
    "the rhmc algorithm uses rational approximations and their partial - fraction expansions to approximate such fractional powers over the range of eigenvalues of the quadratic dirac operator .",
    "provided that the condition number ( ratio of maximum to minimum eigenvalues ) of this operator is not too large , sufficiently good approximations to this fractional power can be obtained with a modest order of numerator and denominator polynomials in this approximation .    the first theory we consider is lattice qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath4 , but with no explicit symmetry breaking parameter @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator for this theory has an unknown lower bound .",
    "however , we can make a reasonable guess as to what is a conservative estimate of the lower bound for the small @xmath4 values of interest .",
    "the need for such an exact algorithm is indicated , since , in hmd(r ) simulations , the binder cumulants which are used to determine the nature of the finite temperature phase transition for this theory depend strongly on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have adapted the rhmc algorithm to this theory with 3-fermion flavours and tested the reversibility needed for its implementation . to check the validity of our speculative lower bound to the dirac spectrum ,",
    "we have compared our measurements with extrapolations to zero @xmath0 of our results from earlier hmd(r ) simulations at various @xmath0s .",
    "in addition , we have performed simulations using rational approximations which assume much smaller lower bounds to the spectrum , at the largest @xmath4 value and selected @xmath5 and @xmath6 values which we used with the original choice of bounds .",
    "indications are that our original choice of lower bounds are adequate .",
    "the second theory we are considering is 2-flavour lattice qcd at zero quark mass , using the @xmath1qcd action , which incorporates an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction that allows simulations at zero quark mass @xcite . here",
    "again , we have reasonable estimates of the upper bound of the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator , but the lower bound is unknown .",
    "again we make an educated guess as to what is a reasonably conservative lower bound for the spectrum of this operator and test our choice . for a @xmath7 lattice , we found that using 32-bit floating point precision , was the main limit on reversibility . with 64-bit precision ,",
    "the convergence criteria for the multimass dirac operator inversion was the limiting factor , leading us to prefer using 64-bit precision .",
    "we tried 3 different choices of speculative lower bounds on the quadratic dirac operator comparing the inversions at the beginning and at the end of each trajectory . for the 2 lowest choices",
    ", these inverses agreed to within the known accuracy of the rational approximations used , for all trajectories in the run .",
    "the highest choice agreed with the other 2 for almost all trajectories in the run .",
    "in addition we made direct comparison of the results of simulations using the rhmc algorithm with earlier measurements using the hmd(r ) algorithm on small ( @xmath8 ) lattices .",
    "section  2 introduces the 2 theories under consideration with rational approximations . in section  3",
    "we discuss the case of qcd at finite @xmath4 , while in section  4 we consider @xmath1qcd . finally in section  5",
    "we present discussions and conclusions .",
    "in this section we present two lattice qcd actions for which the lower bound on the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator is unknown .",
    "this is important for the application of the rhmc algorithm for numbers of fermion flavours other than multiples of 8 .",
    "one can only find a rational approximation to a fractional power @xmath9 of a positive ( semi-)definite matrix to any desired relative accuracy , if one knows positive lower and upper bounds to its spectrum .",
    "if @xmath10 is a positive ( semi-)definite matrix with eigenvectors @xmath11 and corresponding ( non - negative ) eigenvalues @xmath12 , and @xmath9 is a real number , @xmath13 gives a unique definition of any real power of @xmath10 .",
    "if one knows the spectral bounds on @xmath10 i.e. that @xmath14 , for some @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then one can find a rational approximation to @xmath17 of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are polynomials in @xmath12 , such that for a any given ( small ) positive @xmath21 @xmath22 } { |\\lambda^\\alpha - p(\\lambda)/q(\\lambda)| \\over |\\lambda^\\alpha| } \\le \\epsilon.\\ ] ] as @xmath23 or @xmath24 , the orders of @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 needed @xmath25 .",
    "the method of calculating the best approximation for fixed orders of @xmath19 and @xmath20 was specified by remez .",
    "we use an implementation provided by clark and kennedy @xcite ( note that this approximation also yields the best rational approximation to @xmath26 ) .",
    "this rational approximation to the eigenvalues of @xmath27 provides a rational approximation to @xmath27 itself as @xmath28 which can be implemented directly in terms of the matrix @xmath10 without having to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "expanding the right - hand - side of equation  [ eqn : malpha ] in terms of partial fractions allows the action of @xmath27 on any vector to be calculated using a multishift conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite for little more than the cost of a single conjugate gradient inversion .",
    "lattice qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath4 , has the staggered quark action @xcite @xmath29\\chi                     + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the standard staggered quark transcription of @xmath31 with the links in the @xmath32 direction multiplied by @xmath33 and those in the @xmath34 direction multiplied by @xmath35 . for finite temperature simulations with @xmath36 , we set the coefficient @xmath12 of the explicit symmetry breaking term to zero .",
    "as it stands , this action describes 4 quark flavours ( in the continuum limit ) .    to tune this to @xmath37 flavours following the rhmc approach ,",
    "we replace this with the pseudo - fermion action @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the momentum conjugate to the pseudo - fermion field @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41^\\dag             [ d\\!\\!\\!\\!/(\\frac{1}{2}\\tau_3\\mu_i)+m ] + \\lambda^2\\ ] ] is the quadratic dirac operator , and we set @xmath42 . to apply the rhmc algorithm",
    "we will need rational approximations to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] is an upper bound to the spectrum of @xmath46 .",
    "we , in fact , choose an upper bound of @xmath47 which exceeds this bound for any choice of @xmath4 and @xmath6 we are ever likely to consider . at @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a lower bound on the spectrum",
    ". one might expect that this bound is overly conservative , and that the actual lower bound would be closer to @xmath50 . for @xmath51 , we do not know the lower bound of the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator .",
    "however , the effective pion mass is @xmath52 , so if this gives at least some guide as to the lower bound of this operator , we would expect the lower bound of its spectrum to decrease smoothly as @xmath4 is increased , becoming zero at @xmath53 , the value of @xmath4 at the zero temperature transition to the superfluid phase .",
    "our observations from hmd(r ) simulations , indicate that in this low @xmath4 regime the dirac operator becomes more singular as @xmath4 is increased , in a controlled way . since we are interested in quark masses @xmath54 , we choose a speculative lower bound of @xmath55 , 4 times lower than the known lower bound at @xmath48 for @xmath56 .",
    "tests are applied to see that this is reasonable .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath1qcd staggered lattice action incorporates an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction of the gross - neveu form , which allows us to run at zero quark mass . in terms of pseudo - fermion fields",
    "@xmath40 and their conjugate momenta @xmath39 the fermion action , modified for implementation of the rhmc algorithm is @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 running over the 16 sites on the dual lattice neighbouring the site on the normal lattice , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the usual gauge - covariant `` d - slash '' for the staggered quarks . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the auxiliary fields which implement the 4-fermion interactions .",
    "the action for these auxiliary fields is @xmath65 where the sum is over the sites of the dual lattice . for more details of the rest of the action we refer the reader to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we did , however make one minor change , multiplying the @xmath66 ` kinetic energy ' by @xmath67 , which acts as a large mass and slows down the dynamics of these chiral fields .",
    "although we do not know the upper bound of the spectrum of the dirac operator , because of the interaction with the chiral field , we know from our hmd(r ) simulations that @xmath68 is just above 1 .",
    "for @xmath69 and @xmath70 the coefficient @xmath71 .",
    "this plus the fact that the @xmath63 and @xmath64 interacting with the fermion fields at a given point are averages over 16 points on the dual lattice , suggest that 1 is a conservative upper bound for the contribution of the chiral fields to the eigenvalues of the dirac operator .",
    "we thus assume an upper bound of @xmath47 for the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator .",
    "if this were violated , it would only affect modes close to the ultraviolet cutoff on the theory , which are of limited interest .",
    "we shall later present evidence that the magnitude of the chiral field which interacts with the fermion field at a point _ is _ bounded by @xmath72 .",
    "more important is an accurate knowledge of the lower bound on the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator .",
    "here we simply assume that the action of the chiral fields on the spectrum is similar to giving the quarks a small mass .",
    "our speculative lower",
    "bound is that for a regular staggered action with a quark mass @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 , and we perform tests of this assumption .",
    "the rhmc algorithm for qcd at a finite chemical potential @xmath4 for isospin is implemented following clark and kennedy @xcite .",
    "the rational approximations are obtained using the michael clark s remez code @xcite .",
    "we have been using this method for simulating @xmath57 flavour qcd .",
    "here we use a @xmath75 rational approximation to @xmath76 needed at the beginning of each trajectory , and a @xmath75 rational approximation to @xmath77 needed at the end of the trajectory to calculate the final ` energy ' ( value of the classical molecular - dynamics hamiltonian describing the system ) , over the interval @xmath78 $ ] discussed in section  2 .",
    "these approximations have a maximum relative error of @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution of the fields over the trajectories were performed using a @xmath80 rational approximation to @xmath81 over the interval @xmath78 $ ] , which has maximum relative error of @xmath82 . since we have been using relatively small lattices @xmath8 and @xmath83",
    ", we have found 32-bit floating - point precision ( accumulations are performed in 64-bit precision ) to be adequate .    for the rhmc algorithm to be exact , i.e. for it to produce an ensemble of configurations which have the correct boltzmann distribution for the given action with no @xmath0 dependence",
    ", the updating algorithm must be reversible .",
    "the updating method specified by kennedy et al .",
    "is reversible for infinite precision arithmetic , even when the multimass conjugate gradient solver used to invert the dirac operator is stopped prior to convergence .",
    "( the inversions at the beginning and end of each trajectory still need to be exact for this to hold ) . with the finite precision used by computers ,",
    "this reversibility must be tested . as mentioned above",
    ", we use single precision ( 32-bit ) floating point arithmetic for simulations of lattice qcd at finite @xmath4 . to test this",
    "we performed a 1000 trajectory run on a @xmath83 lattice at @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , in which every second trajectory was run forward and then reversed , returning to its initial state .",
    "@xmath87 for this experiment , and the trajectory length @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath86 is chosen , because it is the largest @xmath4 used in our production runs .",
    "@xmath85 , just above the critical mass , is the smallest mass for which we run at @xmath86 , and @xmath84 , close to the transition @xmath5 for these values of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , is one we use for production runs .",
    "we expect therefore that the dirac operator will be as close to singular as we will encounter in any of our simulations , and that if the algorithm is satisfactory here , it will work for the whole range of parameters we use .    the change in ` energy ' @xmath89 , for each of the 500 reversed trajectories is plotted in figure  [ fig : deiso]a .",
    "the change in energy for each of the non - reversed trajectories is shown in figure  [ fig : deiso]b .",
    "we choose @xmath90 as a measure of reversibility because it is the quantity that is used in the global metropolis accept reject step .",
    "hence departures of @xmath89 from zero , its value for true reversibility , indicate the size of errors introduced from departures from exact reversibility coming from finite precision errors potentially magnified by instabilities .",
    "as we see , these are indeed small in magnitude ",
    "@xmath91 , and @xmath92 orders of magnitude smaller than the change @xmath93 in energy over a typical trajectory used for normal updating .",
    "in addition , the average @xmath89 over the 500 trajectories considered is only @xmath94 , indicating that there is no sign of a systematic bias , so that the small errors introduced by this lack of reversibility are likely to cancel .",
    "most of the simulations of lattice qcd at finite isospin density , which we have run using this code use @xmath87 , and all use trajectory length @xmath88 . with this choice",
    "we find an acceptance rate of @xmath95 for the generated trajectories .",
    "most of our runs used the same @xmath5 for the updating as for the global metropolis step , since we did not find large gains from choosing different @xmath5s .",
    "we check our speculative lower bound on the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator of @xmath96 , at our largest @xmath4 ( @xmath86 ) at both masses ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) where we performed production simulations .",
    "this we did by running using rational approximations , valid over intervals with the same upper bound , but different lower bounds , and compared observables . at @xmath99 , @xmath86 and @xmath100 , we performed a 300,000 trajectory run with rational approximations valid over the interval @xmath78 $ ] used for production running and a 300,000 trajectory run with the same rational approximation for updating , but a @xmath75 rational approximation valid over the range @xmath101 $ ] for initiating each trajectory and for calculating the energy at the end of each trajectory .",

    "@xmath103 we ran one 300,000 trajectory run with rational approximations valid over our default interval ( @xmath78 $ ] ) and one 300,000 trajectory run with rational approximations valid over the interval @xmath104 $ ] for initialization , measurement _ and _ updating each trajectory .",
    "for this later interval we used @xmath105 rational approximations with maximum relative error @xmath106 at the ends of each trajectory and @xmath107 rational approximations with a maximum relative error of @xmath108 for the updating .",

    "one notes that , despite the high statistics  300,000 trajectories for each run , the error bars are sizable .",
    "this is because the chosen @xmath5 values are very close to @xmath110 , the transition @xmath5 , in each case which serves to maximize the fluctuations .",
    "finally we compare the values of two fluctuation quantities , the binder cumulant @xmath113 and the chiral susceptibility @xmath114 at @xmath110 with results obtained from our hmd(r ) simulations over a range of @xmath0 values for @xmath99 and an intermediate value of @xmath4 , @xmath115 , in figure  [ fig : b4,chi ] . the leading errors in hmd(r )",
    "are expected to be @xmath3 .",
    "the fits linear in @xmath116 in these figures appear to support this expectation , but indicate that we would need to include an @xmath117 term to fit over the whole range of measurements .",
    "we note that the finite @xmath0 errors in both these graphs are quite large , so that agreement between hmd(r ) and rhmc is non - trivial .",
    "since we have been simulating the thermodynamics of @xmath1qcd with 2 massless quark flavours on @xmath118 and @xmath7 lattices , we use this larger lattice to run our tests . on this size lattice , extensive comparisons with the hmd(r ) algorithm over a range of @xmath0 values is impractical , as is performing high statistics runs with various speculative lower bounds .    our first tests used a single - precision ( 32-bit floating - point ) version of the code , then a modified version where the multimass conjugate gradient inversions which initiate and end each trajectory were replaced with double - precision ( 64-bit floating - point ) versions , while leaving the inversion routines which perform the updates within each trajectory in single precision .",
    "we then performed reversibility tests of the same nature as those described in the previous section .",
    "for the updating , our convergence criterion was applied to the normalized conjugate gradient residual for the lowest lying pole in the partial fraction expansion of the rational approximation , while at the beginning and end of each trajectory it was applied to the unnormalized residual .",
    "( if @xmath119 is an approximate solution to the linear equations @xmath120 , the unnormalized residual is @xmath121 .",
    "the normalized residual is @xmath122 . )",
    "we denote this upper limit on these residuals by @xmath123 and note that , since our sources are extensive , this means that we are using a much more stringent convergence criterion at the beginning and end of each trajectory than in the updating , as required .    figure  [ fig : desingle]a shows the changes in energy over the ` closed ' trajectories @xmath124 for the single precision code and for the same code with the initial and final inversions for each trajectory performed in double precision .",
    "@xmath125 for these runs , since we have determined that no improvement is obtained by decreasing @xmath123 below this value .",
    "@xmath126 , used for these simulations , is close to the critical point .",
    "the trajectory length is @xmath72 time unit and @xmath127 which gives an acceptance of @xmath128 .",
    "however , we turn off the accept / reject step in the rhmc algorithm for the purpose of these reversibility tests to speed up the passage of the system through phase space .",
    "the single precision code produces energy changes as large as @xmath129 .",
    "more troubling is the fact that @xmath89 is strongly biased to positive values .",
    "in fact the average @xmath89 is @xmath130 which suggests that this code could produce small but significant systematic errors .",
    "the mixed single / double precision code shows more promise and we have extended our run to include 500 closed trajectories as shown in figure  [ fig : desingle]b .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath131 is @xmath132 , which is larger than we would prefer .",
    "more problematic is that the average @xmath89 over the range is @xmath133 , which suggests a systematic bias as is apparent in figure  [ fig : desingle]b .",
    "unfortunately , we are limited by precision from improving this situation .",
    "we thus feel that to be safe we should increase the precision , especially if we wish to allow ourselves the option of increasing the lattice size in the future .",
    "we have tested reversibility of our double precision code as a function of the residual @xmath123 .",
    "the results for 50 closed trajectories are shown in figure  [ fig : dedouble ] .",
    "we see that this measure of reversibility of the trajectories improves considerably as @xmath123 is decreased from @xmath134 to @xmath73 . comparing this graph with that for the single precision tests , we see that precision is indeed the limiting factor .",
    "further tests indicate that it is the convergence of the approximate inversions during the updating ( rather than that of the more precise inversions at the start and end of each trajectory ) that is the limiting factor .",
    "careful monitoring of the trajectories for the @xmath135 run , indicates that this is largely due to the fact that the number of iterations of the conjugate gradient inverter sometimes differed by 1 or 2 iterations between the corresponding steps of the forward and reversed trajectories , and this of course has the largest effect when one is far from convergence .",
    "this can be corrected by running for a fixed number of conjugate gradient iterations rather than at fixed @xmath123 . since at @xmath135",
    "it requires around 250 iterations on average for the inversion at each update , we performed a run of 1000 trajectories with the number of inverter iterations at each update set to 300 ( those at the ends of the trajectories were still set by a conservative choice of @xmath123 ) .",
    "the results of running for 1000 trajectories ( 500 closed ) with the number of conjugate gradient iterations fixed at 300 are shown in figure  [ fig : dedouble2]a along with an identical number of trajectories with these inversions set by @xmath136 . the maximum value of @xmath131 for the case where the number of conjugate gradient iterations is fixed at 300 is @xmath137 , no better than the single precision results .",
    "for @xmath136 the maximum value of @xmath131 is @xmath138 which we consider acceptable .",
    "the reason that fixing the number of conjugate gradient iterations at a relatively small value did not give better results is presumably because this gives relatively poor convergence for some configurations .",
    "studies of the hmc algorithm have indicated that if the convergence is too poor , the updating procedure develops instabilities which amplify the effects of finite precision errors @xcite .",
    "we believe that such instabilities are most likely the reason why using a fixed number of conjugate gradient iterations during updating did not lead to smaller violations of reversibility .",
    "figure  [ fig : dedouble2]b shows the change of energies for the open trajectories from the same @xmath136 run .",
    "we now need to justify our choices of spectral bounds on the quadratic dirac operator .",
    "the chosen upper bound of @xmath47 is obtained assuming that the magnitude of the average of the 16 chiral auxiliary fields @xmath139 which couple to the fermion bilinear @xmath140 at each site is bounded above by @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows the maximum over the lattice sites of the magnitude of @xmath139 at the beginning and end of 3000 trajectories of our production running at @xmath141 , @xmath126 , @xmath70 , @xmath142 , trajectory length @xmath72 and @xmath136 , where the acceptance is around 6070% . as can be seen , @xmath72 _ is _ a conservative upper bound for @xmath143 .",
    "since we are using a relatively large lattice ( @xmath7 ) it is not practical to obtain adequate statistics close to the phase transition with more than one choice of speculative lower bounds as was done with our simulations of lattice qcd at finite isospin chemical potential , in order to check for consistent results .",
    "instead , we performed a simulation of 1000 trajectories with a speculative lower bound of @xmath144 . at the beginning of each trajectory where we calculate the momenta @xmath39 conjugate to the pseudo - fermion fields , as @xmath145 we compared the values of @xmath39 obtained with rational approximations which assume lower bounds of @xmath74 , @xmath144 and @xmath146 .",
    "these used @xmath105 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 rational approximations respectively , with maximum relative errors of @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "similar comparisons were made of the @xmath152s at the end of each trajectory reconstituted as @xmath153 no comparisons with results from using different speculative lower bounds were made during the updates , since using different rational approximations corresponds to making different choices of the updating hamiltonian , and such choices are unimportant unless they significantly affect the acceptance .    in figure  [ fig:68]a , we show the magnitude of the difference between @xmath39 values calculated using a lower bound of @xmath74 and those using a lower bound of @xmath144 .",
    "we plot the maximum over sites and colours of this quantity for each trajectory as well as the average over sites and colours .",
    "figure  [ fig:68]b shows such differences for @xmath152 .",
    "for 997 of these trajectories , the differences in @xmath39 , and @xmath152 values are consistent with zero within the accuracies of the rational approximations we use . for the other 3 trajectories ,",
    "the differences are much larger .",
    "in addition , we note that the configurations which give relatively large errors for @xmath39 , and for @xmath152 , are identical .",
    "figure  [ fig:810 ] shows differences between the same quantities for lower bounds of @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively for the _ same _ trajectories as in figure  [ fig:68 ] .    in this case",
    "all differences are consistent with zero within the accuracy of the rational approximations we use .",
    "we interpret these results as indicating that for 997 of the configurations generated , all eigenvalues of the quadratic dirac operator are @xmath156 . for the remaining 3 configurations ,",
    "the minimum eigenvalues lie between @xmath154 and @xmath157 .",
    "it is reassuring to note that even for these configurations the differences are small , since a typical @xmath39 or @xmath1 has a magnitude @xmath158 .",
    "hence it is probably reasonable to use a speculative lower bound of @xmath157 and , unless this run was anomalous , choosing a speculative lower bound of @xmath154 is completely safe .",

    "we have implemented the rhmc for 2 lattice actions where the lower bound on the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator is unknown .",
    "the first is the action for staggered lattice qcd with a finite chemical potential @xmath4 for isospin , in the small @xmath4 regime .",
    "the second is the @xmath1qcd action where the standard staggered quark action is augmented with a chiral 4-fermion interaction which allows simulations at zero quark mass . in the first case we simulate 3 fermion flavours , in the second 2 .",
    "both situations require taking a fractional power of the fermion determinant so that standard hmc methods fail , and the alternative hmd(r ) algorithm gives finite @xmath0 errors . in each case",
    "the rhmc algorithm is implemented using a speculative lower bound to this spectrum , and its validity is tested by simulations .",
    "this rather naive approach appears successful in both cases .    in each case",
    "we test the reversibility of our implementation",
    ". this would be exact for infinite precision arithmetic and exact inversions at the beginning and ending of the trajectories .",
    "we test this by reversing our trajectories and determining how close we come to the initial state .",
    "the measure of this is the difference between the classical energy of this final configuration and that of the initial configuration .",
    "since energy differences appear in the global metropolis accept / reject step at the end of each trajectory , this energy difference should be much less than one . because this energy is an extensive quantity ,",
    "this requirement becomes more stringent as the lattice size is increased .",
    "for qcd at finite @xmath4 , we are using @xmath83 lattices for which we find single - precision ( 32-bit ) floating - point arithmetic to be adequate . for @xmath1qcd , where we are simulating on @xmath7 lattices",
    "double - precision arithmetic appears desirable .",
    "here we have also studied convergence requirements on the inversions needed to implement the rational approximations , both at the beginning and end of the trajectory and in the updating .",
    "those at the beginning and end of each trajectory need to be performed with high precision .",
    "the inversions in the updating can be performed with less precision .",
    "if these updating inversions are too imprecise , the change in energy will be large and the final configuration will not be accepted .",
    "it appears , however , that the instabilities due to finite precision are worse when these inversions are too imprecise , and this is more important in determining the minimum acceptable precision than are acceptance criteria .",
    "for qcd at finite @xmath4 we test our speculative lower spectral bounds by 2 methods .",
    "first we find that the rhmc results for binder cumulants and chiral susceptibilities agree with extrapolations of our hmd(r ) results to @xmath2 , and that the position of the transitions calculated from both types of simulation appear consistent .",
    "second , at the largest @xmath4 we use , we check that all observables and fluctuation quantities at the transition agree with those obtained with simulations using speculative lower bounds which are @xmath159 or @xmath160 times smaller than our initial choice .",
    "this indicates that a lower bound of @xmath161 is adequate .    for @xmath1qcd",
    ", we find good agreement between measurements made using rhmc simulations and those made using hmd(r ) simulations on @xmath8 lattices . with our production lattice sizes of @xmath7 , it is impractical to make such detailed comparisons between the 2 methods .",
    "in addition making runs with sufficient statistics to compare different speculative lower bounds is also too expensive .",
    "instead , we have compared applying rational approximations which assume different lower bounds to a set of 1000 configurations generated during one of our runs .",
    "we find agreement to within the accuracy of our rational approximations for speculative lower bounds of @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "an approximation using a speculative lower bound of @xmath157 agrees with that using a speculative lower bound of @xmath154 on most of these configurations . even in those cases where the two estimates do not agree ,",
    "the differences are small enough that the errors introduced in a production run would probably be negligible .",
    "we conclude therefore that a lower bound of @xmath154 is almost certainly acceptable , and one of @xmath157 is probably acceptable .",
    "we did apply this test to our qcd at finite @xmath4 simulations comparing speculative lower bounds of @xmath161 and @xmath157 .",
    "although there is no indication of any difference within the precision of our measurements , the limitation of 32-bit precision prevents us from using this test to make definitive statements .",
    "we conclude that the use of speculative lower bounds for the spectrum of the quadratic dirac operator is adequate to allow use of the rhmc exact algorithm to simulate either of the theories we have considered . for theories where it is necessary to determine the lower bound dynamically , comparisons between the results of different speculative lower bounds could be made from a set of choices starting with that with the largest lower bound , during a run ( as we have done ) , and choosing the first approximation which passes the test .",
    "this way the expensive calculations of the rational approximations using the remez method , need only be performed once .",
    "the order of the rational approximation required to achieve the desired accuracy with a given lower bound does not increase very rapidly as that bound is increased . for example , in our applications where the relative error is always less than @xmath162 , we achieve this for the 2-flavour case using a @xmath75 rational approximation for a lower bound of @xmath161 , a @xmath105 approximation for @xmath157 , a @xmath147 approximation for @xmath154 , and a @xmath148 approximation for @xmath155 .",
    "hence the ` library ' of rational approximations one would need to maintain for such an implementation would be rather small .",
    "such methods could be useful for domain - wall fermions and overlap fermions which have the problem that their lower spectral bounds are also unknown , and might need to be determined dynamically @xcite .",
