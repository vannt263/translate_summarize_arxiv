    "reliable entanglement distribution between quantum nodes over long distances is of crucial importance for quantum communication . a possible way of overcoming the destructive influence of decoherence in the process of entanglement distribution is provided by quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "they take advantage of previously shared entanglement between neighbouring pairs of quantum nodes and enable the generation of entanglement between two distant quantum nodes by entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "furthermore , subsequent entanglement purification procedures @xcite are capable of distilling high - fidelity entangled pairs from a sufficiently large number of low - fidelity entangled pairs .",
    "recently various physical setups and entanglement distribution protocols have been proposed for the realization of quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "implementations of entanglement distribution which are compatible with existing classical optical communication networks and which are based on multiphoton signals are particularly attractive . the recent proposal of van loock et al .",
    "@xcite of a hybrid quantum repeater is an example for such an implementation .",
    "it takes advantage of the transmission of coherent photon states through an optical fibre and subsequent photonic postselection for the generation of entanglement between distant pairs of material qubits which are entangled with the photons by weak non - resonant interactions .",
    "however , in this proposal the assumed weak non - resonant couplings between the material qubits and the photons involved impose unfavourable restrictions on the photonic postselection process by which the material entangled qubit pairs are prepared . in order to overcome these limitations ,",
    "recently this hybrid quantum repeater model has been generalized to the resonant strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the collapse phenomenon well known from the jaynes - cummings - paul model @xcite can cause favourable quantum correlations between two material qubits and the photons involved , which enable the preparation of perfectly entangled material qubit pairs by photonic postselection with the help of a von neumann measurement . in this idealized model",
    "it has been assumed that effects of spontaneous emission during the short qubit - photon interactions are negligible and that photonic states can be transferred perfectly between the two cavities containing the two trapped material qubits by an interconnecting long - distance optical fibre .",
    "although a realization of the assumed cavity - fibre couplings is still challenging , recently highly promising experimental developments have been taking place in this direction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , effects originating from the motion of the trapped material qubits on the entanglement generation have been neglected in these early investigations in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "an important issue in any implementation of such a photon - mediated entanglement distribution scenario is the physical realization of the material qubits @xcite .",
    "trapped ions or atoms are well suited for this purpose as the quantum technology for controlling their degrees of freedom is already well advanced @xcite . in particular , it is important to control the centre - of - mass motion of these material qubits properly as it introduces unwanted decoherence and dissipation .",
    "motivated by the current interest in realizations of hybrid quantum repeaters and in entangelement distribution in general , in this paper the decohering influence of the centre of motion of trapped qubits on entanglement generation is investigated . for this purpose",
    "we start from our previous generalization of the quantum repeater model of van loock et al . @xcite and discuss the decohering and dissipative influence of the qubits centre - of - mass motion on the generation of distant qubit entanglement in the strong quantum electrodynamical coupling regime .",
    "we demonstrate that the quality of the generated entanglement is rather sensitive to the trap frequency , with high trap frequencies increasing the fidelity of the entangled pairs .",
    "a second main aim of our work is to propose a local dynamical decoupling scheme @xcite which is capable of eliminating the unwanted influence of the centre - of - mass motion by acting on each trapped material qubit only locally .",
    "this dynamical decoupling scheme generalizes previous ideas of facchi et al .",
    "@xcite to unitary decoupling operations with degenerate spectra acting on an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , the fact that this dynamical decoupling scheme does not act on the internal degrees of freedom of the locally trapped qubits directly , but only on their centre - of - mass degrees of freedoms makes it attractive for potential experimental realizations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ the model ]",
    "we introduce our theoretical model .",
    "the internal physical degrees of freedom of the two trapped qubits to be entangled are modelled by three - level systems whose upper electronic levels are coupled by single - mode photon fields inside cavities .",
    "the two photon cavities containing these trapped material three - level systems are coupled by a long optical fibre .",
    "furthermore , we shortly describe the general framework of optimal generalized photon measurements , which lead to entanglement of the two material quantum systems by photonic postselection .",
    "numerical results are presented describing the decohering and dissipating influence of the trapped qubits centre - of - mass motion on the fidelity of the generated entangled qubit states and on the relevant success and minimum error probabilities . in section [ decoupling ]",
    "we address the suppression of these decohering and dissipating effects and propose a dynamical decoupling scheme which acts only on the degrees of freedom of the centre - of - mass motion .",
    "technical details , such as the derivation of a proper baker - hausdorff formula and details of the relevant photon states , are given in [ bh ] and [ calc ] .",
    "in a hybrid quantum repeater , entanglement is created between two distant material qubits with the help of photon exchange and subsequent photonic postselection .",
    "the two spatially separated material qubits can , for example , be implemented as internal states of trapped ions or atoms . in a ramsey - type interaction scenario ,",
    "the first qubit interacts shortly with the radiation field inside a cavity resulting in an entangled state between this qubit and the photon field .",
    "after transmission of the resulting photon wave packet into a second distant cavity by an optical fibre it interacts shortly with the second qubit . if the photon state transfer between both cavities is perfect , the resulting entanglement between the two distant material qubits and the photons can be used to prepare an almost perfectly entangled state between the two qubits by an appropriate photonic measurement .",
    "a recent theoretical investigation demonstrates that such perfect photonic quantum state transfer between two distant cavities is possible by an appropriate choice of the couplings between two cavities by an optical fibre @xcite ( see also @xcite for alternative solutions ) and recent experimental developments @xcite indicate that such photonic quantum state transfers can be realized .",
    "in general , however , in such a scenario the centre - of - mass motion has to be taken into account as its degrees of freedom also participate in the formation of the entanglement between the material quantum systems and the photons involved , thus causing decoherence and dissipation .",
    "the main aim of this chapter is to explore this particular source of decoherence and dissipation which has been neglected in investigations so far .",
    "in particular we are interested in the circumstances under which high - fidelity entangled states of the distant qubits can be prepared by optimal photon measurements .",

    "this could be achieved by a stark - switching procedure , since the coupling of the internal states with the centre - of - mass motion without a radiation field is small during the interaction time @xmath0 .",
    "this has the additional effect that the time used to implement the pulses does not contribute to the interaction time @xmath0 , since no interaction is taking place .",

    "the fidelity also improves with the number of pulses @xmath184 , so the smaller the parameter @xmath266 is in the experimental setup , the more pulses must be employed to get a good fidelity at the end of the interaction .",
    "but as explained before , in actual experimental realizations the number of pulses one can implement is not independent of the pulse width @xmath266 due to constraints on the overall process time @xmath237 , expected to be primarily given by the rate of spontaneous decay @xmath239 . given this constraint , we need to figure out what the best choice of number of pulses @xmath184 is , considering that the choice of @xmath184 also fixes the maximal pulse time @xmath230 by the inequality in .",

    "unsurprisingly the results are better if more time is available for pulse implementation .",
    "somewhat surprsingly , however , is that the achievable fidelity stabilizes at higher pulse numbers @xmath184 , so the choice of whether to do larger numbers of short pulses or smaller numbers of longer pulses has little influence as long as the number of pulses does not fall below a certain threshold . for small numbers of pulses",

    "a novel decoupling sequence was presented by uhrig @xcite for protecting a single quantum bit with a sequence of @xmath221 pulses which are not applied equidistantly over time with a common pulse distance of @xmath267 . instead , the pulses are applied at times @xmath275 $ ] during the interaction time @xmath0 .",

    "this motion is a source of decoherence and dissipation and decreases the probabilities of creating high fidelity entangled pairs of distant qubits .",
    "in particular , we investigated two distant three - level systems confined in harmonic potentials and coupled to single - mode cavity fields , which are connected by a multi - mode optical fibre . for the description of the centre - of - mass motion of the three - level systems we used the lamb - dicke and the rotating wave approximations for the description of the interaction between the radiation field and the internal states .",
    "we further simplified by setting the single - mode radiation field frequencies to be equal to the frequency difference of the two upper internal energy levels of the three - level system . in this model",
