    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are characterized by low star formation rate @xcite and low disk surface density @xcite .",
    "the spiral structure in lsbs is often incipient or fragmentary and usually faint and difficult to trace @xcite , and they generally do not host any strong large - scale spiral structure , the kind we see in case of normal hsb galaxies like our milky way .",
    "we note that , we are interested only in small lsbs , which are more abundant , and do not include the giant lsbs like malin  1 . some of the giant lsbs show fairly strong , large - scale spiral structure as in ugc  6614 @xcite and in the inner regions they are dynamically similar to their high surface brightness ( hsb ) counterparts @xcite .",
    "@xcite has applied the technique of density - wave theory to put constraint on the decomposition of the rotation curve in lsbs .",
    "however we note that in the sample considered by @xcite contains giant lsb ( e.g. , ugc  6614 ) which often show large - scale spiral structure ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the lsbs are dark matter dominated from the very inner regions @xcite . within the optical disk ,",
    "the dark matter constitutes about @xmath1 per cent of the total mass of lsbs , whereas for the hsbs the contributions of the dark matter halo mass and stellar mass are comparable @xcite .",
    "thus , the lsbs constitute a natural laboratory to study the effect of dark matter halo on different aspects of galactic dynamics .",
    "several past studies have shown the effect of dominant dark matter halo in the suppression of global non - axisymmetric bar modes @xcite , in making the galactic disks superthin @xcite and in prohibiting the swing amplification mechanism from operating , thus explaining the lack of small - scale spiral structure as noted observationally @xcite .    according to the density wave theory ,",
    "the grand - design spiral arms are the high density regions of a rigidly rotating spiral density wave , with a well defined pattern speed , that are self - consistently generated by the combined gravity of the unperturbed disk and the density wave @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on this see @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite ( hereafter paper",
    "1 ) investigated the role of a dominant dark matter halo on the global spiral modes within the framework of the density wave theory by treating the galactic disk as a fluid . using the input parameters of a superthin lsb galaxy ugc  7321 and the galaxy , they found that for ugc  7321 , the dark matter halo has a negligible effect on arresting the global spiral modes when the disk is modeled as a fluid .",
    "this is in contrast to the results for small - scale spiral features where the dark matter was shown to suppress the small - scale , swing - amplified spiral structures almost completely @xcite .",
    "ghosh et al .",
    "( paper 1 ) argued that that since lsbs are relatively isolated , tidal interactions are less likely to occur compared to those for the high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "thus even though the global spiral modes are formally permitted in the fluid disk plus dark matter halo model , it was argued that it is the lack of tidal interaction that makes it difficult for the global spiral structure to develop in these galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we address the effect of dark matter halo on global @xmath0 modes by modeling the galactic disk more realistically as a @xmath2 system .",
    "a tidal encounter is likely to give rise to global modes , as has been seen in simulations , as in m51 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the dispersion relation for a @xmath2 disk to construct global standing - wave like solutions by invoking the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ( for details see paper  1 ) .",
    "note that fluid disks allow wavelike solutions at small wavelengths , since fluid pressure provides the restoring force ; but collisionless disks suppress wavelike modes for very small wavelengths ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "the   2 contains formulation of the problem and the input parameters . in   3 we present the wkb analysis and the relevant quantization rule .   4 *   5 * contain the results and discussion , respectively while   6 contains the conclusions .",
    "we model the galactic disk as a collisionless system characterized by an exponential surface density @xmath3 , and one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath4 . for simplicity ,",
    "the galactic disk is taken to be infinitesimally thin .",
    "in other words , we are interested in perturbations that are confined to the mid - plane ( @xmath5 ) . the dark matter halo is assumed to be non - responsive to the gravitational perturbations of the disk .",
    "we have used cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 in our analysis .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the models that we have used for the study of effect of dark matter halo on the global spiral modes .",
    "the dynamics of the disk is calculated first only under the gravity of the disk ( referred to as disk - alone case ) and then under the joint gravity of disk and the dark matter halo ( referred to as disk plus halo case ) .",
    "we took an exponential stellar disk with central surface density @xmath7 and the disk scalelength @xmath8 , which is embedded in a concentric dark matter halo whose density follows a pseudo - isothermal profile characterized by core density @xmath9 and core radius @xmath10 .    the net angular frequency , @xmath11 and the net epicyclic frequency , @xmath12 for a galactic disk embedded in a dark matter halo , concentric to the galactic disk , are given as : + @xmath13    the expressions for @xmath14 , @xmath15 in the mid - plane ( @xmath5 ) for an exponential disk and @xmath16 , @xmath17 for a pseudo - isothermal halo in the mid - plane ( @xmath5 ) have been calculated earlier ( see paper 1 for details ) .    in the early - type galaxies ,",
    "the bulge component dominates in the inner regions , and hence exclusion of the bulge component from the models for early - type galaxies will underestimate the rotation curve in the inner regions . in paper 1 , it was shown that for the galaxy , inclusion of bulge yielded more realistic results ( for details see   5.1 in paper 1 ) .",
    "also note that ugc  7321 has no discernible bulge @xcite .",
    "therefore , only for our galaxy we have included bulge in both the disk - alone and disk plus dark matter halo models .",
    "we adopt a plummer - kuzmin bulge model for our galaxy which is characterized by total bulge mass @xmath18 and bulge scalelength @xmath19 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath20 , @xmath21 in the mid - plane ( @xmath5 ) for such a bulge having a plummer - kuzmin profile are given in paper 1 .",
    "therefore , for the galaxy , these @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms will be added in quadrature to the corresponding terms due to disk and dark matter halo .",
    "the input parameters for different components of ugc  7321 @xcite and the galaxy @xcite are summarized in table 1 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      shows that the modes do not extend up to the resonance points , consistent with the fact that @xmath22 is not equal to zero anywhere for modes in fig .",
    "[ fig3].,title=\"fig:\",width=326,height=230 ]   shows that the modes do not extend up to the resonance points , consistent with the fact that @xmath22 is not equal to zero anywhere for modes in fig .",
    "[ fig3].,title=\"fig:\",width=336,height=230 ]    from table  2 , it is evident that the dark matter halo has a negligible effect on the global spiral modes for the galaxy , the difference can be seen only in the change of the specific values of pattern speed @xmath23 .",
    "this result is at par with our expectation , since the dark matter halo is known to be not important in the inner regions of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these results are consistent with the results of paper 1 where the galactic disk was modeled as a fluid disk .",
    "the key difference with results from paper 1 is that the specific values of pattern speed @xmath23 which give the global modes are different ( for comparison , see table 3 in paper 1 ) .",
    "@xcite found a range of @xmath24 km s@xmath25 kpc@xmath25 for the pattern speed of spiral arms for the galaxy . on comparison",
    "the pattern speed values obtained in this paper lie outside the observed range of pattern speed .",
    "the shape of the closed contours in this work ( figs .",
    "1 - 3 ) is different from that in paper 1 .",
    "a curve of constant @xmath23 had nearly identical @xmath22 values at the turning points of a closed curve of _ type b _ in paper 1 , whereas the contours look slanted in the present paper , meaning that the @xmath22 values at the turning points are substantially different .",
    "this is due to the difference in the dispersion relation for the two cases .",
    "a more detailed interpretation is not possible in a simple analytical form , since the dispersion relation for the collisionless case ( equation  ( [ disp - equation ] ) ) has a transcendental form .    in this paper for simplicity",
    "we have not included the low velocity dispersion component , namely , gas in the system which could further modify the obtained range of pattern speeds .",
    "note that any late - type spiral galaxy contains non - negligible amount of gas , and it has been shown that the gas plays a significant role in various dynamical issues ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of gas present in ugc  7321 is quite small in comparison to that in hsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the results for ugc  7321 obtained in this paper - in particular the suppression of global modes by the dominant dark matter halo is unlikely to change significantly if gas is included in the calculation .",
    "the effect of gas on the global spiral modes in a gravitationally coupled two - component ( stars and gas ) system , as applicable to the gas - rich hsb galaxies , will be taken up in a future paper .",
    "the results presented here are based on the assumption that the grand - design spiral structure seen in disk galaxies is due to the density waves , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "however this hypothesis has not yet been fully confirmed observationally .",
    "for example , the angular off - set in age of the stellar population , as predicted by the classical density wave theory has not been found in studies by @xcite in their sample of late - type disk galaxies .",
    "also the study of @xmath26 observation of ngc  1068 using generalized tremaine - weinberg method by @xcite has revealed that the pattern speed of the spiral structure of this galaxy varies rapidly with radius , indicative of short - lived spiral features .",
    "a study of the gas content and the @xmath27 line of sight velocity distribution in ngc  6754 by @xcite revealed a different sense of streaming motion in the trailing and leading edge of this galaxy , indicating that the spiral arms of this galaxy is likely to be a transient .    on the other hand , it is also worth noting that @xcite have recently presented a study of measuring pitch angle from the images taken in different wavelengths for a large sample of disk galaxies and found that the pitch angle varies from one wavelength to another as predicted by the classical density wave theory , and thus furnishes strong observational evidence for the validity of the density - wave theory of spiral structure in disk galaxies",
    ".    generally the various @xmath28-body studies so far do not show the evidence of long - lived spiral structure .",
    "several @xmath28-body simulations have shown that the spiral arms are transient and get wound up quickly @xcite , which goes against the classical density wave picture .",
    "interestingly an opposite trend is shown in a recent work by @xcite who reported long - lived spiral structure in a @xmath28-body study of models for galaxies with intermediate bulges .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a dominant dark matter halo on the possible existence of global spiral arms while modeling the galactic disk as a _ collisionless _ system .",
    "the wkb dispersion relation and the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition were used to obtain discrete global spiral modes present in any model .",
    "we have analysed a superthin lsb galaxy ugc  7321 , and the galaxy , for this work .",
    "we found that for ugc  7321 both the disk - alone and the disk plus dark matter halo cases did not yield any discrete global spiral modes .",
    "even an increase in the stellar central surface density by a factor of few failed to produce any global spiral modes .",
    "thus our findings provide a natural explanation for the observed dearth of strong large - scale spiral structure in the lsbs .",
    "our results differ from those obtained in paper 1 where the galactic disk was treated as a fluid , where it was found that the dominant dark matter halo had a negligible constraining effect on the existence of global spiral modes in these galaxies .",
    "this difference is due to the different dispersion relation for fluid and collisionless systems , which played a pivotal role in determining the discrete global mode(s ) present in a model .",
    "thus the correct collisionless treatment for stars as done here has led us to a result for the non - existence of global spiral modes which is in agreement with the observations . as a check , for the galaxy we carried out a similar modal analysis and found that the dark matter halo has a negligible effect on the global spiral modes , as expected since the galaxy is not dark matter dominated in the inner regions , in contrast to ugc  7321 .",
    "thus , the dark matter halo that dominates from the innermost regions is shown to suppress the growth of local , swing - amplified non - axisymmetric features @xcite as well as the global spiral modes as shown here .",
