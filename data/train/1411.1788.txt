    "@xmath1 is a graph @xmath2 together with a _ signature _ , a mapping @xmath3 , that assigns each edge with a sign .",
    "the graph @xmath2 is called the _ underlying graph _ of @xmath1 . in this work we focus on signed graphs whose underlying graph is a _ series - parallel graph _ , that is , a graph that can be obtained from copies of @xmath4 by iterated series and parallel connections .",
    "a signed graph can be given an _ orientation _ as follows .",
    "viewing each edge as composed of two half - edges , we orient each half - edge independently ; it is required that of the two half - edges of an edge @xmath5 , exactly one points to its endvertex if @xmath5 is positive , while none or both of them point to their endvertices if @xmath5 is negative .",
    "a _ nowhere - zero @xmath6-flow",
    "_ @xmath7 on a signed graph @xmath1 is an orientation @xmath8 of edges of @xmath1 and a valuation @xmath9 of its arcs by non - zero integers whose absolute value is smaller than @xmath6 , such that for every vertex the sum of the incoming values ( the _ inflow _ ) is equal to the sum of the outgoing ones ( the _ outflow _ ) .",
    "graphs ( signed or unsigned ) admitting at least one nowhere - zero @xmath6-flow ( for some @xmath6 ) are called _ flow - admissible_.    with respect to nowhere - zero flows , all - positive signed graphs ( i.e. , those with all edge signs positive ) behave like ordinary unsigned graphs .",
    "thus , problems about nowhere - zero flows in signed graphs include the celebrated 5-flow conjecture of tutte  @xcite :    [ conj:5-flow ] every flow - admissible graph has a nowhere - zero @xmath10-flow .    while there are examples showing that the analogue of conjecture  [ conj:5-flow ] is false for general signed graphs ( as discussed below ) , bouchet  @xcite conjectured that things do not get much worse :    [ conj : bouchet ] every flow - admissible signed graph has a nowhere - zero @xmath0-flow .",
    "the best published partial result in the direction of bouchet s conjecture is a 30-flow theorem by zka  @xcite from 1987 .",
    "recently , a 12-flow theorem was announced by devos  @xcite .",
    "an infinite family of signed graphs reaching the bound stated in conjecture  [ conj : bouchet ] was found by schubert and steffen  @xcite .",
    "the smallest member of the family is shown in figure  [ fig : lower ] .",
    "interestingly , the underlying graphs of the members of this family are series - parallel .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the situation in the unsigned case , where each flow - admissible series - parallel graph trivially admits a nowhere - zero 3-flow . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the family of signed series - parallel graphs and prove the corresponding restriction of bouchet s conjecture :    [ t : main ] every flow - admissible signed series - parallel graph has a nowhere - zero @xmath0-flow .    the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof ] .    1",
    "in this section , we review the necessary terminology . our graphs may contain parallel edges .",
    "the _ switching at a vertex @xmath11 _ of a signed graph is the operation of inverting the signs on all the edges incident with @xmath11 .",
    "two signed graphs are _ switching equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of switchings .",
    "since switching does not affect the existence of a nowhere - zero @xmath6-flow ( for any @xmath6 ) , we may treat switching equivalent graphs as identical .",
    "it is well known that an unsigned graph is flow - admissible if and only if it is bridgeless .",
    "before we state a corresponding characterisation for signed graphs due to bouchet  @xcite , we recall several basic notions .",
    "a _ balanced cycle _ is a cycle with an even number of negative edges .",
    "an _ unbalanced cycle _ is a cycle with an odd number of negative edges .",
    "a signed graph is called _ unbalanced _ if it contains an unbalanced cycle .",
    "otherwise it is _ balanced_. a _ barbell _ in a signed graph @xmath2 is the union of two edge - disjoint unbalanced cycles @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a path @xmath14 satisfying one of the following properties :    * @xmath12 and @xmath13 are vertex - disjoint , @xmath14 is internally vertex - disjoint from @xmath15 and shares an endvertex with each @xmath16 , or * @xmath17 consists of a single vertex @xmath18 , and @xmath14 is the trivial path consisting of @xmath18 .",
    "a _ signed circuit _ in @xmath2 is either a balanced cycle or a barbell in @xmath2 .",
    "with respect to flows , signed circuits are analogous to cycles in unsigned graphs .",
    "the following characterisation theorem is due to bouchet  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.1 ) :    [ t : admissible ] a signed graph @xmath2 is flow - admissible if and only if each of its edges is contained in a signed circuit .    a _ two - terminal graph _ @xmath19 consists of a graph @xmath2 together with two distinguished vertices , the _ source terminal _ @xmath20 and the _ target terminal _",
    "@xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath19 to @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath23 be two - terminal graphs and @xmath24 their disjoint union .",
    "the _ series connection _",
    "@xmath25 of @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath24 by identifying , for @xmath26 , the target terminal of @xmath27 with the source terminal of @xmath28 . by definition ,",
    "the source and target terminal of @xmath25 is the source terminal of @xmath29 and the target terminal of @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the _ parallel connection _",
    "@xmath31 of @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath24 by identifying their source terminals and identifying their target terminals .",
    "the source terminal of the resulting graph is the vertex obtained by the identification of the source terminals of the graphs @xmath27 , and similarly for the target terminal .",
    "a _ series - parallel graph _ is a two - terminal graph obtained by a sequence of series and parallel connections , starting with copies of @xmath4 ( with some choice of the terminals ) .",
    "if @xmath23 ( @xmath32 ) are series - parallel graphs such that @xmath2 is a series or a parallel connection of @xmath23 and @xmath33 is maximum with this property , then we refer to the @xmath27 as _ parts _ of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , in the case of a series connection , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the _ endparts _ of @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath34 is a _ piece _ of @xmath2 if there is a sequence @xmath35 such that for each @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a part of @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 itself is a piece of @xmath2 .",
    "the _ replacement _ of @xmath34 by a series - parallel graph @xmath39 in @xmath2 consists in removing all the edges and non - terminal vertices of @xmath34 in @xmath2 , adding @xmath39 and identifying each of its terminals with the corresponding terminal of @xmath34 in @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the following notation for small signed series - parallel graphs : @xmath40 denotes the positive @xmath4 , @xmath41 stands for the negative @xmath4 , and @xmath8 is the unbalanced 2-cycle .",
    "we define the _ depth _ @xmath42 of a signed series - parallel graph @xmath2 by letting @xmath43 , and @xmath44 where @xmath24 ranges over all parts of @xmath2 .",
    "the following observation is immediate from the definition :    [ obs : depth ] if @xmath45 , then @xmath2 contains a piece of depth @xmath6 .",
    "another useful observation is the following one ; it can be proved by straightforward induction :    [ obs : two ] each non - terminal vertex of a series - parallel graph has at least two distinct neighbours .",
    "we will need the following lemma , proved in  @xcite by induction :    [ l : change ] if @xmath46 is an edge in a @xmath47-connected series - parallel graph @xmath2 , then @xmath48 is a series - parallel graph .",
    "we begin by using easy reductions to prove the following observation :    [ l : reductions ] let @xmath2 be a counterexample to theorem  [ t : main ] of minimum size",
    ". then @xmath2 has the following properties :    a.   if @xmath2 is of series type , then its endparts are unbalanced , b.   the degree of each non - terminal vertex is at least three , c.   if a terminal vertex has degree two , then it is contained in a 2-cycle .",
    "we prove ( i ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 has a balanced endpart @xmath24 ; let @xmath49 denote the terminal @xmath49 of @xmath24 that is a cutvertex of @xmath2 , and let @xmath39 be obtained from @xmath2 by removing @xmath50 .",
    "we show using theorem  [ t : admissible ] that @xmath39 is flow - admissible .",
    "suppose the contrary ; then an edge @xmath5 of @xmath39 is not contained in a signed circuit of @xmath39 .",
    "however , @xmath2 is flow - admissible , and it is not hard to see that any signed circuit of @xmath2 missing in @xmath39 is a balanced circuit contained in @xmath24 ( as @xmath24 is balanced and @xmath49 is a cut - vertex ) .",
    "this is a contradiction , so @xmath39 is indeed flow - admissible . by the minimality of @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath39 admits a nowhere - zero 6-flow .",
    "since any unsigned series - parallel graph admits a nowhere - zero 3-flow , so does the balanced signed graph @xmath24 . combining these two flows , we obtain a nowhere - zero 6-flow on @xmath2 , a contradiction .",
    "let us prove ( ii ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be a non - terminal vertex of degree 2 , say incident with edges @xmath51 .",
    "switching at @xmath49 if necessary , we may assume that @xmath52 is positive .",
    "by observation  [ obs : two ] , the endvertices of @xmath51 different from @xmath49 are distinct .",
    "contracting @xmath52 , we therefore obtain a ( loopless ) series - parallel graph @xmath34 . since the contraction of a positive edge preserves the existence of a nowhere - zero flow , @xmath34 is flow - admissible and hence it has a nowhere - zero 6-flow by the minimality of @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a 6-flow @xmath53 on @xmath2 , possibly with @xmath54 .",
    "however , since @xmath49 has degree 2 , we have @xmath55 , so @xmath53 is nowhere - zero .",
    "a similar argument works for terminal vertices of degree 2 with two distinct neighbours .",

    ".    the following result will be useful in the proof of lemmas  [ l : parallel ] and [ l : admissible ] below .",

    "this concludes the proof .",
    "let us call a graph _ reduced _ if the degree of each of its non - terminal vertices is at least 3 , and there is no pair of parallel edges of the same sign .",
    "observe that each part ( and hence , each piece ) of a reduced graph is reduced .",
    "it is easy to see that the only reduced graph of depth 1 is the unbalanced 2-cycle @xmath8 .    a _ string _ is a series connection of copies of @xmath40 and @xmath8 where each non - terminal vertex is contained in a 2-cycle ( see figure  [ fig : string ] ) .",

    "let @xmath168 and @xmath169 be the source and target terminal , respectively , of the necklace @xmath24 ( as well as of the graph @xmath170 ) .",
    "let @xmath171 denote the 2-cycle in @xmath170 .",
    "consider an arbitrary edge @xmath5 of @xmath34 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath5 is contained in a signed circuit of @xmath34 .",
    "suppose the contrary .",
    "we first observe that @xmath2 contains no @xmath173-path that contains @xmath5 and is vertex - disjoint from @xmath24 except for its endvertices ( let us call such a path an _",
    "@xmath5-detour _ ) . indeed , combining such a path with one of the two @xmath173-paths in @xmath170 would provide us with a balanced cycle of @xmath34 containing @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , each cycle of @xmath2 containing @xmath5 is edge - disjoint from @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath5 is not contained in any signed circuit of @xmath34 , any such cycle must be unbalanced .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath2 is flow - admissible , @xmath5 is contained in a signed circuit @xmath174 of @xmath2 , which must therefore be a barbell . clearly , @xmath174 is not edge - disjoint from @xmath24 , for otherwise @xmath174 is a signed circuit containing @xmath5 in @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath175 and @xmath176 be the unbalanced cycles in @xmath174 and let @xmath177 be the path connecting them .",

    "since @xmath34 is connected , there exists a path connecting @xmath175 and @xmath171 and therefore also a barbell of @xmath34 containing @xmath5 , a contradiction .",

    "on the other hand , at least one @xmath179 has to be contained in @xmath24 , for otherwise they both contain @xmath168 and @xmath169 , violating the definition of a barbell .",
    "we may thus assume that @xmath175 is contained in @xmath24 and @xmath176 is not .",
    "since @xmath176 contains both terminals of @xmath24 , we have @xmath180 , which is a contradiction , since @xmath181 .",

    "let us choose a shortest path @xmath14 in @xmath182 connecting @xmath176 to a terminal of @xmath24 ; the union of @xmath14 , @xmath176 , @xmath171 and an edge of @xmath170 connecting @xmath171 to an endvertex of @xmath14 is then a barbell in @xmath34 containing @xmath5 .",
    "this finishes the discussion of case  1 .",
    "we show that @xmath2 is of parallel type",

    "this is clear if @xmath24 is a ( proper ) subgraph of one of the parts of @xmath2 .",
    "otherwise , the two strings forming @xmath24 are parts of @xmath2 , and by the assumption that @xmath2 contains an unbalanced cycle edge - disjoint from @xmath24 , there are some more parts .",
    "then @xmath34 is the parallel connection of these parts with @xmath170 .    by symmetry",
    ", we may assume that @xmath5 is not incident with the terminal @xmath169 of @xmath170 .",
    "let @xmath184 be an unbalanced cycle in @xmath2 edge - disjoint from @xmath170 .",
    "since @xmath34 is 2-connected , it contains a path @xmath185 joining @xmath168 to @xmath184 and avoiding @xmath169 . the union of @xmath171 , @xmath185 , @xmath184 and the edge connecting @xmath171 to @xmath168 is a barbell containing @xmath5 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "we claim that there is indeed an unbalanced cycle of @xmath2 that is edge - disjoint from @xmath24 , as required in lemma  [ l : admissible ] .",

    "let @xmath2 be a parallel connection of its parts @xmath186 .",
    "the necklace @xmath24 is either a union of two strings @xmath187 for some @xmath188 and @xmath189 , or it is a proper subgraph of some @xmath190 .",
    "suppose first the former  say , @xmath191 .",
    "then @xmath192 , because @xmath193 . if there exists @xmath194 such that @xmath190 contains an unbalanced cycle , we are done .",
    "since @xmath2 is reduced , each @xmath190 is reduced as well , and thus every @xmath190 is a signed @xmath4 . if there exist @xmath190 and @xmath37 ( @xmath195 ) such that they have opposite signs , then @xmath187 is the sought unbalanced cycle edge - disjoint from @xmath24 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath196 , because @xmath2 is reduced and it does not contain parallel edges of the same sign . if neither @xmath76 nor @xmath77 is a @xmath40 , then @xmath197 is a necklace of @xmath2 with @xmath198 , which is a contradiction with the choice of @xmath24 . on the other hand , if @xmath24 contains a string that is a @xmath40 , then the string forms an unbalanced 2-cycle with @xmath199 ( as @xmath2 is reduced ) , and @xmath2 is a necklace , which is a contradiction with corollary  [ cor : flow ] .",
    "suppose now that @xmath24 is a proper subgraph of one of the parts of @xmath2 , say @xmath76 . by a similar argument as above",
    "we conclude that @xmath200 and @xmath77 is a signed @xmath4 .",
    "moreover @xmath76 is a series connection of ( reduced ) graphs @xmath201 for some @xmath202 . if any of the graphs",
    "@xmath203 that does not contain @xmath24 contains an unbalanced cycle , we are done .",
    "therefore each @xmath203 that does not contain @xmath24 is a signed @xmath4 . since @xmath24 is a proper subgraph of @xmath76 , we conclude that at least one of the terminals of @xmath2 must be of degree 2 .",
    "but the terminal is not contained in an unbalanced 2-cycle , which is a contradiction with lemma  [ l : reductions ] ( c ) .",
    "this proves the claim that @xmath2 satisfies the hypothesis of lemma  [ l : admissible ] and the graph @xmath34 is flow - admissible .",
    "the graph @xmath170 , used to obtain @xmath34 , has four edges .",
    "all necklaces have at least four edges , with @xmath204 and its mirror image being the only ones with exactly four .",
    "these necklaces , however , have one vertex fewer than @xmath170 , so the choice of @xmath2 implies that @xmath34 admits a nowhere - zero @xmath0-flow @xmath69 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath69 to @xmath171 ( the 2-cycle in @xmath170 ) is an @xmath79-pseudoflow for some @xmath81 and @xmath82 . by observation  [ obs : digon ] ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath205 . furthermore , since the values of @xmath69 on the edges of @xmath206 are @xmath207 and @xmath208 , we find that @xmath209 are nonzero elements of @xmath119 . by lemma",

    "the argument is similar to the argument of case a , except that we use the graph @xmath210 or @xmath211 in place of @xmath170 ( so as to obtain a flow - admissible graph ) and invoke an analogue of lemma  [ l : admissible ] .",
