    "moreover , we have @xmath687 and @xmath688 let us then choose a real root @xmath689 of the principal part @xmath25 of @xmath4 of maximal multiplicity @xmath690 i.e. , the principal root .",
    "then @xmath691 again by theorem [ s3.4 ] ,    we apply the real change of variables @xmath201 given by @xmath692 and put @xmath571 let us again endow all quantities associated to @xmath425 with a superscript @xmath693 .",
    "now , if the coordinates @xmath284 are adapted to @xmath27 we choose @xmath694 and are finished .    otherwise , the principal face @xmath673 is a compact edge , and we have @xmath695 and @xmath696 recall that the principal part @xmath683 of @xmath425 is @xmath697-homogeneous of degree one .",
    "we claim that @xmath698    indeed , recall that the effect of our change of coordinates @xmath261 on the newton polyhedron is such that it preserves all lines @xmath699 let us therefore choose @xmath700 so big that we have @xmath701 for every point @xmath48 lying on any such line passing through any point in the newton diagram @xmath702 of @xmath703 and denote by @xmath63 the taylor polynomial of order @xmath704 of @xmath2 then it is clear that @xmath4 and @xmath63 have the same principal faces and parts , and the same applies to @xmath425 and @xmath705 i.e. , we have @xmath706 and @xmath707 we can therefore apply our results for the analytic case to the polynomial function @xmath63 and obtain .",
    "now , either the new coordinates @xmath284 are adapted , in which case we are finished . or",
    "we can apply the same procedure to @xmath703 etc .. in this way , we obtain a sequence of functions @xmath709 with @xmath710 and @xmath711 which can be obtained from the original coordinates @xmath29 by means of a change of coordinates @xmath712 of the form @xmath713 with positive integers @xmath714 and real coefficients @xmath715 moreover , if @xmath716 denotes the maximal order of vanishing of the principal part of @xmath717 along the unit circle @xmath221 then we have @xmath718    either this procedure will stop after finitely many steps , or it will continue infinitely .",
    "if it stops , say , at the @xmath719-th step , it is clear that we will have arrived at an adapted coordinate system @xmath720 with a polynomial function @xmath721    assume that the procedure does not terminate . since the maximal multiplicities @xmath722 of the roots of the principal part of @xmath717 form a decreasing sequence , we find again some @xmath723 such that @xmath623 for every @xmath624 by comparing with the effect of the change of coordinates in each step of order @xmath724 with the effect on the taylor polynomial of sufficiently high degree , we see from the corresponding result in the analytic case that the principal part of @xmath717 is of the form @xmath725 where @xmath726 it is mixed homogeneous of degree one with respect to the weight @xmath727 given by @xmath728 so that , for @xmath729 @xmath730    now , according to the classical borel lemma , we can find a smooth function @xmath635 near the origin whose taylor series is the formal series @xmath731 consider the smooth change of coordinates @xmath732 given by @xmath733 and put @xmath571 we claim that the coordinates @xmath284 are adapted to @xmath604    indeed , we have @xmath734 where @xmath735 has the taylor series @xmath736 in view of , this",
    "show that @xmath737 where @xmath343 is a smooth function consisting of terms of @xmath738-degree strictly bigger than one , for every @xmath729 i.e. , @xmath739 since @xmath740 as @xmath741 this implies that @xmath742 moreover , if @xmath743 then the left - hand side of is bounded by @xmath744 if @xmath745 so that we must have @xmath746 in combination , and show that the newton polyhedron @xmath385 of @xmath425 contains the point @xmath747 but nor further point on the left to this point on the line @xmath659 and that all other points of @xmath385 are contained in the open half - plane above this line . since @xmath748 this shows that the principal face of @xmath385 is the unbounded horizontal half - line given by @xmath749 hence the coordinates are adapted to @xmath604        moreover , if we choose @xmath544 such that the principal face @xmath23 of the newton polyhedron of @xmath4 lies on the line @xmath750 and assume without loss of generality that @xmath751 then the corollaries [ s4.3 ] and [ s4.4 ] remain true in this smooth setting .",
