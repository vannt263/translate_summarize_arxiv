    ", we conclude that the basic arguments that have been used in the interpretation of sm measurements  @xcite remain valid in this minimal resonant extension of the sm higgs sector .",
    "our analysis straightforwardly generalizes to the two higgs doublet model  @xcite and the @xmath155hdm  @xcite .",
    "measurements at large momentum transfers as a probe of non - decoupling off - shell higgs contributions provide an excellent testing ground of various scenarios of bsm physics .    in this paper",
    "we have further examined the validity of the interpretation of off - shell measurements as a probe of the higgs total width . in combination with a signal strength @xmath156 , we motivate the double ratio @xmath157 of eq .   as guideline for when this interpretation is valid , namely @xmath46 within uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , measurements at large invariant @xmath4 masses in @xmath158 at the lhc run  2 will have significant impact on searches for bsm physics far beyond the interpretation in terms of the higgs width .",
    "we have discussed a wide range of bsm scenarios as examples that highlight this fact . in particular , we have provided a quantitative analysis of the high invariant mass region of @xmath158 in the context of the mssm , a general dimension six extension of the sm higgs sector , and resonant phenomena within higgs portal scenarios .",
    "generic to all bsm scenarios is the model - dependence of the off - shell region .",
    "if we observe an excess in the future in the high @xmath29 region , the interpretation of such an observation is not necessarily related to the higgs but could be a general effect of the presence of new tev - scale dynamics . in particular , the `` off - shell signal strength '' has no relation to on - shell higgs properties such as the width or even higgs couplings , unless imposed by a choice of a particular class of bsm scenarios such as eq .  .",
    "an example of that , which we have not discussed in further detail are electroweak magnetic operators or an additional broad and heavy @xmath159 boson , that can impact the @xmath160-induced production channels in a way that is a priori unrelated to the higgs sector .",
