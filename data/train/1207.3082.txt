    "over the last ten years there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite in the presence of unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "we have witnessed the discovery of many highly non - trivial supersymmetric solutions of supergravity , together with a rather detailed understanding of their gauge theory duals .",
    "supersymmetric solutions with an anti - de sitter ( ads ) factor are particularly important , as they are dual to _ superconformal _ field theories , in an suitable limit .",
    "comprehensive studies of general supersymmetric ads geometries , in different dimensions , have been carried out in @xcite and led to a number of interesting developments .",
    "these results have all been obtained using the technique of analysing a canonical @xmath9-structure in order to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will systematically study the most general class of @xmath0 ads@xmath5 solutions of @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "supersymmetric ads@xmath5 solutions of @xmath1 supergravity have been discussed before in the literature @xcite . however , these references contain errors , and reach incorrect conclusions that miss important classes of solutions .",
    "our main motivation for studying ads@xmath5 solutions of @xmath1 supergravity in particular is that , starting with the seminal work of @xcite , over the past few years there has been considerable progress in understanding the ads@xmath5/cft@xmath10 correspondence in m - theory . in particular , with @xmath11 supersymmetry there is good control on both sides of the duality , and this has led to many new examples of ads@xmath5/cft@xmath10 dualities , including infinite families , along with precise quantitative checks . on the gravity side , the simplest setup is that of freund - rubin ads@xmath12 backgrounds of m - theory , where @xmath13 is a sasaki - einstein manifold include three - sasakian manifolds and orbifolds of the round seven - sphere . ] .",
    "these are conjectured to be dual to the theory on a large number @xmath14 of m2-branes placed at a calabi - yau four - fold singularity .",
    "rather generally , these field theories are believed to be strongly coupled chern - simons - matter theories at a conformal fixed point . with @xmath15 supersymmetry the partition function of such a theory on",
    "the three - sphere localizes @xcite , reducing the infinite - dimensional functional integral exactly to a finite - dimensional matrix integral .",
    "this can then often be computed exactly in the large @xmath14 limit , where @xmath14 is typically related to the rank of the gauge group , and compared to a gravitational dual computation which is purely geometric .",
    "such computations have now been performed in a variety of examples @xcite , with remarkable agreement on each side .    thus far , almost all attention has been focused on ads@xmath16 solutions .",
    "this is for the simple reason that very few ads@xmath5 solutions outside this class are known .",
    "an exception is the corrado - pilch - warner solution @xcite , which describes the infrared fixed point of a massive deformation of the maximally supersymmetric abjm theory on @xmath14 m2-branes in flat spacetime .",
    "this solution is topologically ads@xmath4 , but the metric on @xmath17 is not round , and there is a non - trivial warp factor and internal four - form flux on the @xmath17 .",
    "this has more recently been studied in @xcite , and in particular in the last reference the free energy @xmath18 of the @xmath0 superconformal fixed point was shown to match the free energy computed using the gravity dual solution .",
    "the corrado - pilch - warner solution also has a simple generalization to massive deformations of @xmath14 m2-branes at a cy@xmath19 four - fold singularity , where cy@xmath10 denotes an arbitrary calabi - yau three - fold cone singularity .    in this paper",
    "we systematically study the most general class of @xmath0 ads@xmath5 solutions of m - theory .",
    "these have an eleven - dimensional metric which is a warped product of ads@xmath5 with a compact riemannian seven - manifold @xmath2 . in order",
    "that the @xmath20 isometry group of ads@xmath5 is a symmetry group of the full solution , the four - form field strength necessarily has an `` electric '' component proportional to the volume form of ads@xmath5 , and a `` magnetic '' component which is a pull - back from @xmath2 .",
    "we show , with the exception of the sasaki - einstein case , that the geometry on @xmath2 admits a canonical local @xmath3-structure , and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a supersymmetric solution in terms of this structure .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 is equipped with a canonical killing vector field @xmath21 , which is the geometric counterpart to the @xmath22 r - symmetry of the dual @xmath23 superconformal field theory .",
    "purely magnetic solutions correspond physically to wrapped m5-brane solutions , and we correspondingly recover the supersymmetry equations in @xcite from our analysis .",
    "there is a single known solution in the literature , where @xmath2 is an @xmath24 bundle over a three - manifold @xmath25 equipped with an einstein metric of negative ricci curvature .",
    "on the other hand , solutions with non - vanishing electric flux have a non - zero quantized m2-brane charge @xmath26 , and include the sasaki - einstein manifold solutions as a special case where the magnetic flux vanishes .",
    "for the general class of solutions with non - vanishing m2-brane charge , we show that supersymmetry endows @xmath2 with a canonical contact structure , for which the r - symmetry vector field @xmath21 is the unique reeb vector field . a number of physical quantities",
    "can then be expressed purely in terms of contact volumes , including the gravitational free energy referred to above , and the scaling dimension of bps operators @xmath27 dual to probe m5-branes wrapped on supersymmetric five - submanifolds @xmath28 .",
    "these formulae may be evaluated using topological and localization methods , allowing one to compute the free energy and scaling dimensions of certain bps operators without knowing the detailed form of the supergravity solution .    in our analysis",
    "we recover the corrado - pilch - warner solution as a solution to our system of @xmath3-structure equations .",
    "we also show that this solution is in a subclass of solutions which possess an additional killing vector field . for this subclass",
    "the supersymmetry conditions are equivalent to specifying a ( local ) khler - einstein four - metric , together with a solution to a particular second order non - linear ode . we show that this ode admits a solution with the correct boundary conditions to give a gravity dual to the infrared fixed point of cubic deformations of @xmath14 m2-branes at a cy@xmath19 four - fold singularity .",
    "in particular , when cy@xmath29 equipped with its flat metric , this leads to a new , smooth @xmath0 supersymmetric ads@xmath4 solution of m - theory .",
    "the plan of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : susy ] we analyse the general conditions for @xmath30 supersymmetry for a warped ads@xmath31 background of eleven - dimensional supergravity , reducing the equations to a local @xmath3-structure when @xmath2 is not sasaki - einstein . in section [ sec : contact ]",
    "we further elaborate on the geometry and physics of solutions with non - vanishing electric flux , in particular showing that solutions admit a canonical contact structure , in terms of which various physical quantities such as the free energy may be expressed .",
    "this section is an expansion of material first presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : taukilling ] we analyse the supersymmetry conditions under the additional geometric assumption that a certain vector bilinear is killing .",
    "in addition to recovering the corrado - pilch - warner solution , we also numerically find a new class of cubic deformations of general cy@xmath19 backgrounds .",
    "section [ concsec ] briefly concludes .",
    "a number of technical details , as well as the analysis of various special cases , are relegated to four appendices .    * note * : shortly after submitting this paper to the arxiv , the paper @xcite appeared , which contains a supersymmetric solution that appears to coincide with the solution we present in section [ sec : taukilling ] .",
    "in this section we analyse the general conditions for @xmath0 supersymmetry for a warped ads@xmath32 background of eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the bosonic fields of eleven - dimensional supergravity consist of a metric @xmath33 and a three - form potential @xmath34 with four - form field strength @xmath35 . the signature of the metric is @xmath36 and",
    "the action is [ action ] s & = & r * _ 11 - g_11 g - cg g  , with @xmath37 the eleven - dimensional planck length .",

    "it follows that only the cohomology class of @xmath220 in the torus @xmath221 is a physically meaningful parameter , and this corresponds to a marginal parameter in the dual cft .",

    "the contact volume has the property , in the sense described precisely in appendix b of @xcite , that it depends only on the reeb vector field @xmath21 determined by the contact structure .",

    "the ads@xmath5 solutions dual to beta - deformations @xcite of @xmath23 field theories must solve the equations that we presented , and it would interesting to verify this explicitly . of course , it would also be very interesting to use our general equations as a method for finding new solutions ( perhaps numerically ) , outside the classes that have been discovered so far marginal deformations @xcite . ] .",
