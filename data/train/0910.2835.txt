    "neutrino oscillations experiments search for a distortion in the neutrino flux at the detector positioned far away from the source . by comparing both near and far neutrino energy spectra ,",
    "one gains information about the oscillation probability and with that about mixing angles and mass squared differences . however , the neutrino energy , that enters critically into the oscillation probability , is not directly measurable but has to be reconstructed from the reaction products .",
    "a proper understanding of neutrino - nucleus interactions is , therefore , essential for the interpretation of current neutrino oscillations experiments .",
    "present @xmath5 disappearance experiments use the ccqe reaction both as signal event and to reconstruct the neutrino energy from the outgoing muon .",
    "ccqe is defined as @xmath6 on a single nucleon ; in the nucleus , ccqe is masked by final - state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "thus , the correct identification of ccqe events is directly related to the question of how fsi influence the event selection .",
    "the main background to ccqe is cc@xmath7 production . if the pion is absorbed in the nucleus and/or not seen in the detector , these events can be misidentified as ccqe . consequently , a proper understanding of ccqe _ and _ cc@xmath7 is essential for the reconstruction of the neutrino energy .    the main task in a @xmath8 appearance experiment like miniboone is to detect electron neutrinos in a ( almost ) pure @xmath5 beam .",
    "the signal event , the @xmath8 ccqe interaction , is dominated by background .",
    "a major problem comes from misidentified events , mainly because of the fact , that the miniboone detector can not distinguish between a photon and an electron .",
    "thus , @xmath5 induced neutral current @xmath9 production , where the @xmath9 decays into two @xmath10s , is the major source of background when one of the photons is not seen or both cherenkov rings overlap .",
    "as all of the present oscillations experiments use nuclear targets , it is mandatory to consider fsi , i.e. , pion rescattering , with and without charge exchange , and absorption in the nuclear medium .",
    "a realistic treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) can be achieved in the framework of a coupled - channel transport theory  the gibuu model .",
    "after a brief review of our model , we first discuss the impact of pion production on ccqe measurements .",
    "we further investigate the influence of nuclear effects on cc@xmath11 and nc@xmath12 cross sections , and , where possible , we confront our model to recent data measured at miniboone . in the second part",

    "relevant for miniboone , sciboone and k2k , the elementary @xmath13 reaction is dominated by two processes : quasielastic scattering and the excitation of the @xmath1 resonance ( p@xmath14(1232 ) ) . additionally , our model includes the excitation of 12 @xmath15 and @xmath1 resonances with invariant masses less than 2 gev and also a non - resonant single - pion background .",

    "baryon - meson two - body interactions ( e.g. , @xmath30 ) are described by resonance contributions and a small non - resonant background term ; baryon - baryon cross sections ( e.g. , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) are either fitted to data or calculated , e.g. , in pion exchange models .",

    "the latter reaction is quite similar to the @xmath39 reaction in that the incoming particle interacts with all target nucleons and the vector couplings are the same .",
    "one challenge is to identify _ true _ ccqe events in the detector , i.e. , muons originating from an initial qe process .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the true ccqe events are masked by fsi in a detector built from nuclei . in general , at cherenkov detectors such as miniboone ccqe - like events are all those where no pion is detected while in tracking detectors such as k2k - scibar / scifi ccqe - like events are those where a single proton track is visible and at the same time no pions are detected . in both detector types the fsi lead to misidentified events , e.g. , an initial @xmath1 whose decay pion is absorbed or which undergoes `` pion - less decay '' can count as ccqe event  we call this type of background events `` fake ccqe '' events .",
    "we denote every event which looks like a ccqe event by `` ccqe - like '' .    to investigate the relation between the ccqe - like and true ccqe cross section , we show their ratio as a function of proton and pion momentum thresholds in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccqelike_over_trueccqe_thresholds ] .",
    "as the proton is not at all relevant for the ccqe identification in cherenkov detectors , the ratio is independent of the proton momentum detection threshold ( dashed line in left panel ) .",
    "this is very different in tracking detectors which rely on the detected proton  here the efficiency is reduced to @xmath4010% at a proton momentum threshold of 0.5 gev ( solid line in left panel ) .",
    "even at @xmath41 the efficiency does not exceed 80% because of charge - exchange processes that lead to the emission of undetected neutrons and because of secondary proton knockout that leads to multiple - proton tracks .",

    "[ fig : ccqelike_over_trueccqe_thresholds ] we find that the ccqe - like cross section increases for both detector types as @xmath42 increases . in this case",

    "fixing the flux normalization with harp s pion - production data , the miniboone collaboration has presented their first , preliminary absolutely normalized total , differential and double differential cross sections for ccqe and finds an excess of about 35% compared to the total cross section measured at nomad , anl and bnl @xcite .",

    "these transition form factors are not well constrained .",
    "provided that one can establish that quark - hadron duality holds with a reasonable accuracy , one could think of using the dis results for estimating the neutrino - nucleus cross sections in the transition region .",
    "so far , most theoretical studies of quark  hadron duality in lepton scattering were dealing with nucleon targets  @xcite .",

    "hence , we consider two different cases in choosing the @xmath78 integration limits for the ratio ( [ eq : int ] ) .",
    "first , for a given @xmath21 , we choose the @xmath78 limits in the same manner as for a free nucleon : @xmath102 \\displaystyle \\xi_{\\rm max } = \\xi(\\tilde{w}=1.1{{\\;\\mathrm{gev } } } , \\ , q^2 ) \\ . \\end{array } \\label{11 - 16-}\\ ] ] we refer to this choice as integrating `` from 1.1 gev '' . the integration limits for the dis curve always correspond to this choice . as a second choice ,",
    "for each @xmath21 we integrate the resonance curve from the threshold , that is from as low @xmath98 as is achievable for the nucleus under consideration .",
    "this corresponds to the threshold value at higher @xmath78 and is referred to as integrating `` from threshold '' . with this choice",
    "we guarantee that the extended kinematical regions typical for resonance production from nuclei are taken into account .",
    "since there is no natural threshold for the @xmath103 , for both choices it is determined from @xmath104 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ 11 - 16- ] ) .",
    "the results for the ratio ( [ eq : int ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2-c12-int ] .",
    "the curve for the isoscalar free - nucleon case is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite with the `` grv '' parametrization for the dis structure function .",
    "one can see that the carbon curve obtained by integrating `` from threshold '' lies above the one obtained by integrating `` from 1.1 gev '' , the difference increasing with @xmath21 .",
    "this indicates that the threshold region becomes more and more significant , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : f2-c12-int ] .",
    "recall , that the flatter the curve is and the closer it gets to 1 , the better local duality would hold .",
    "our calculations for carbon show that the ratio is at the same level as that for the free nucleon or even higher .    for neutrino  iron scattering ,",
    "the structure functions @xmath105 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe56-nu ] . as for the electron - carbon results of fig .",
    "[ fig : f2-c12-em ] , the resonance structure is hardly visible .",
    "the resonance structure functions are compared to the experimental data in the dis region obtained by the ccfr @xcite and nutev @xcite collaborations .",
    "it appears , that the resonance curves slide along the dis curve , as one would expect from local duality , but lie well below the dis measurements .",
    "hence , the computed structure functions do not average to the dis curve .",
    "the necessary condition for local duality to hold is thus not fulfilled .",
    "as expected from local duality , the resonance structure functions for the various @xmath21 values slide along a curve , whose @xmath78 dependence is very similar to the scaling ",
    "limit dis curve .",
    "however , for all @xmath78 , the resonance curves lie below the experimental dis data .",
    "the ratio @xmath106 defined in eq.([eq : int ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - fe56-nu ] .",
    "the curve for the isoscalar free nucleon case is also presented for comparison .",
    "our results show , that 1 ) this ratio is significantly smaller than 1 for all @xmath21 ; 2 ) it is significantly smaller than the one for the free nucleon ; 3 ) @xmath76 is even lower than the corresponding ratio for electroproduction ; 4 ) @xmath76 slightly decreases with @xmath21 .    to summarize",
    ", we find that the resonance structure functions are consistently smaller than dis functions in the same region of the nachtmann variable @xmath78 .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier work @xcite , which implements elementary resonance vertices and nuclear effects differently .",
    "recall that in this analysis for nuclei we include the resonance structure functions and ignore the background ones .",
    "to estimate their contribution and compare the results with the nucleon case is one of the primary tasks of coming investigations .",
    "overall , the impact of nuclear effects impact on observables is dramatic .",
    "final state interactions of produced pions lead to pions being absorbed in the nucleus or rescattered , thus reducing the cross section and shifting the observed pion distributions to lower values of the pion energy .",
    "furthermore , such interactions can lead to knock - out nucleons which experiments tend to identify with qe events .",
    "ccqe and pion production are thus closely entangled .",
    "thus model - independent data are needed for a meaningful comparison of theory with current experiments .",
    "initial state interactions reduce the cross sections and structure functions in the resonance region and change the form of the distributions , dissolving the peaks of individual resonances .",
    "the bloom - gilman duality seems to be violated for nuclear targets , possibly indicating a major change of background amplitudes in the medium .",

    "<S> neutrino - induced pion production on nuclear targets is the major inelastic channel in all present - day neutrino - oscillation experiments . </S>",

    "<S> we find that charged current quasielastic scattering ( ccqe ) and @xmath0 production are closely entangled in actual experiments , due to final state interactions of the scattered nucleons on one hand and of the @xmath1 resonances and pions , on the other hand . </S>",

    "<S> we find the surprising result that the recent @xmath2 production cross section data from miniboone are well described by calculations without any fsi . for higher energies we study the validity of the bloom - gilman quark - hadron duality for both electron- and neutrino - induced reactions . </S>",
    "<S> while this duality holds quite well for nucleon targets , for nuclear targets the average resonance contributions to the structure function @xmath3 are always lower than the dis values . </S>",
