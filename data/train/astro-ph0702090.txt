    "standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is a one - parameter theory , mostly depending on well known nuclear and particle physics processes at the kev - mev scale .",
    "the only free parameter is the baryon fraction @xmath0 , which can be presently determined by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "using the cmb value for @xmath0 turns bbn into a parameter - free ( and thus highly predictive ) theory , which can be used to check the internal consistency of the standard cosmological model , to constrain astrophysical mechanisms like @xmath1li and @xmath2he stellar reprocessing @xcite , to probe the cosmic neutrino background and/or constrain exotic physics , as for example in  @xcite .    in recent analyses like  @xcite",
    "the nuclear channels for the synthesis of light elements up to mass number @xmath3 have been carefully studied .",
    "the relevant reaction rates have also been updated with the most recent experimental and theoretical estimates , thus reducing the uncertainties on the light element abundances .",
    "indeed , a major uncertainty on nuclear abundances arises from the uncertainty on nuclear rates .",
    "however , a necessary pre - requisite is that all the reactions relevant for the synthesis of the elements of interest are included .",
    "the widely used wagoner - kawano code @xcite contains nuclides up to @xmath4o , but no detailed analysis of the completeness of the network for mass number @xmath5 is present in the literature .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the low density of the plasma , the higher coulomb barrier , and the short timescales involved in bbn conspire to produce only small amounts of these elements . yet , although being of negligible entity for the `` traditional '' bbn predictions of light element yields , missing reactions might have huge effects on the synthesis of  metals \" elements with mass number @xmath6 , whose sum we shall denote in the following with m  in particular of the isotopes of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen ( cno elements ) .",
    "the astrophysical properties of stars formed from the collapse of the very first structures in the universe (  popiii stars \" ) may depend on the chemical composition of the cloud  @xcite .",
    "for example , metallicities as low as 10@xmath7 of the solar one ( i.e. number fraction of metals as low as m / h@xmath8 ) might affect the formation of the first generation of _ low - mass _ stars @xcite .",
    "these considerations motivated the present study , whose purpose is to explore the cno synthesis channels in bbn and put sound constraints on their abundances by checking the consistency of the nuclear network . we anticipate that our results essentially confirm the robustness of the standard prediction that the early generation of star developed in a metal - free environment .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ current ] we review the nucleosynthesis path leading to cno elements in the standard bbn code , while in sec .",
    "[ update ] we describe the way this standard nuclear network has been updated and the results we obtain . finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we can summarize the main steps of our analysis as follows : + i ) identification of relevant channels for cno synthesis in the _ existing _ code ; + ii ) update of the relevant reaction rates which are already present ; + iii ) addition of 4 new nuclides : @xmath9li , @xmath10be , @xmath9c , @xmath10c ; + iv ) addition of more than 100 nuclear reactions previously neglected .",
    "here we describe the points i ) , ii ) , leaving the discussion of the following ones to the next section .",
    "the cno synthesis channels in the bbn network described in @xcite , ( hereafter `` c1 '' ) are basically the same as in the original wagoner - kawano code ( hereafter `` c0 '' ) .",
    "one simplification with respect to former analyses is that now one can fix the baryon fraction from cmb measurements , @xmath11  @xcite , so that within current uncertainties , the nucleosynthetic path is uniquely determined .",
    "the eventual small amount of carbon is synthesized through the direct reaction channel @xmath12 or the secondary one @xmath13 none of these reactions is responsible for the final abundance of @xmath14b .",
    "in fact , during bbn both these processes compete with the stronger @xmath15he , which depletes all @xmath14b . the final abundance of this element is therefore provided by the @xmath16 decay of @xmath14c produced by @xmath17 capture on @xmath18be , @xmath19 which is coulomb - barrier suppressed with respect to the analogous @xmath17 capture on @xmath18li .    in principle",
    ", another possible path is via the unstable nuclei with @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22li is produced e.g. by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath22b via @xmath25 . according to our analysis ,",
    "however , these channels only provide a sub - leading contribution to the cno abundances .    the production of heavier isotopes of carbon proceeds typically by radiative proton capture on carbon nuclei , followed by a @xmath26 reaction .",
    "for example , @xmath27c is produced from light elements through the following path @xmath28 and @xmath29c proceeds along from @xmath27c according to @xmath30 nitrogen is produced by means of proton radiative capture on carbon nuclei ",
    "e.g. @xmath31n  and oxygen isotopes are produced with the same mechanisms illustrated so far .",
    "note that once metals ( @xmath32 ) have been synthesized , being thermodynamically more stable ( higher binding energy per nucleon ) they are not disrupted back into lighter elements .",
    "this allows one to use cno elements as estimators of the whole metallicity m , independently of the incompleteness of the network for @xmath33 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the mechanism for @xmath34c production in bbn is completely different from the well known 3-@xmath17 process taking place in stars , as it proceeds through the formation of the intermediate fragile nuclide @xmath14b .",
    "this is easily explained in terms of ( i ) the very low density of the plasma during bbn ( less than 10@xmath35 baryons / cm@xmath2 at @xmath37 kev ) ; ( ii ) the coulomb suppression relevant for heavier nuclei ; ( iii ) the short time - scales involved , of the order of minutes .",
    "our analysis confirms that the synthesis of cno elements in bbn proceeds along a path involving intermediate mass nuclides ( @xmath38 ) ; it is therefore conceivable that by neglecting intermediate mass elements or `` unusual '' reactions for stellar astrophysics standards relevant channels may have been omitted .",
    "this possibility is scrutinized in the following .",
    "the next steps of our analysis have been to modify the code c1 adding 4 nuclides and more than 100 nuclear reactions previously neglected . the criterion adopted for adding new nuclides",
    "is based on their half - lives @xmath39 .",
    "we find that 4 nuclides previously neglected in the c0 code have a value of @xmath39 which is comparable or longer than the typical times involved in bbn .",
    "we have therefore included @xmath9li ( @xmath39=0.178 s ) , @xmath10be ( @xmath39=1.5@xmath40 years ) , @xmath9c ( @xmath39=0.125 s ) , @xmath10c ( @xmath39=19.29 s ) . by adding the main reactions involving these nuclides we are including all viable intermediate channels connecting lighter to heavier elements .",
    "the reactions included for these nuclides , as well as those we added for the nuclides already included in the standard c1 version , have been selected on the basis of physical arguments , first of all coulomb barrier considerations .",
    "reactions with @xmath41 have not been considered as they are mostly suppressed in the late times of bbn , when metals are mainly formed , and energy is very low , namely few kev . also , no projectiles heavier than @xmath42he",
    "have been considered , since lithium and heavier element abundances are extremely small .",
    "for each nuclide a full network including radiative capture , stripping / pick - up and charge - exchange reactions has been implemented .",
    "many of these reactions were missing in the original nuclear network of the c0 .",
    "in fact , they do not have appreciable effects on the light nuclide abundances which was the principal goal of the original codes . to evaluate the missing reaction rates ,",
    "extensive use has been made of compilations and on - line libraries like  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear rates for many of these reactions , when measurements or theoretical models were missing , have been estimated with simple nuclear models , of the kind presented in  @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude uncertainty has been assumed , according to wagoner s prescription .",
    "we shall refer to the code including the new network _ and _ the new nuclides as `` c3 '' code ( 30 nuclides and 262 reactions ) , while the code with an enlarged network but not including the four above - mentioned nuclides is named `` c2 '' ( 26 nuclides and 240 reactions ) .",
    "the c2,3 codes show only few additional subleading synthesis channels for cno elements with respect to the c0,1 codes , in particular a minor difference in @xmath43 ( due to the additional subleading channel @xmath44 ) , and a slightly larger amount of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , see table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is due to a more efficient burning of @xmath43 through the new channels @xmath48 and @xmath49 . due to the increasing of @xmath45 , @xmath47 abundance",
    "is also increased by the ( already present ) reaction @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand we find that the c2 and c3 codes show no appreciable difference in the final abundances , thus proving that the 4 added nuclides play no role in cno synthesis , as reported in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "there are two clear conclusions that one can draw from our results : ( i ) an accurate ( i.e. at the 10% level ) prediction of the metal yield in standard bbn _ does depend _ on the details of the intermediate mass nuclide reaction network ; ( ii ) no _ major _ change is found when enlarging the network .",
    "the physical reason is that at the beginning of the bbn , when the higher temperature and density would favor the formation of cno elements , their synthesis is suppressed in a high entropy universe and by the lack of necessary intermediate elements . on the other hand , when enough `` catalyzers '' are produced at later times",
    "both temperature and density are not high enough to overcome the high coulomb barrier . the evolution of metals and a few lighter elements vs. temperature is shown in fig .  [ bbnevol ] .",
    "note the correlation of the @xmath51 and metal yields with the peak in the @xmath52 production .",
    "also note that the metal yields have a monotone behavior , due to their higher stability with respect to lighter elements .    even taking into account a much enlarged network ,",
    "one might still wonder how robust are the previous conclusions , especially given the lack of data or detailed theoretical models for several reactions .",
    "a detailed discussion of uncertainties for the order 100 new reactions is clearly unpractical . to obtain a generous but more robust upper limit to the yield of metals in standard bbn",
    ", we have performed an analysis of their yields assuming that all the reactions producing at some stage an element with @xmath53 `` instantaneously '' produce @xmath34c , instead . in other words ,",
    "a strong upper bound is obtained by assuming that all yields for nuclides with @xmath5 contribute to cno eventually . in this way",
    ", we neglect any destruction mechanism of intermediate nuclei , the multistep nature of the synthesis of cno nuclides , and we are maximizing the time available for their synthesis . as a result",
    ", we get @xmath54 .",
    "this bound is clearly very conservative ( about a factor 10@xmath55 higher than our best estimate ) , especially considering the fact that nuclides with @xmath56 are very fragile , and the leading reactions they are involved in typically tend to destroy them rather than producing cno elements .",
    "it is also quite robust , as it basically depends upon the thermodynamical properties of the plasma holding for standard bbn and on the well - known nuclear rates involving target nuclei with @xmath57 only .",
    ".[tab : tab1 ] some `` heavier '' nuclei yields ( for @xmath0=0.0223 ) predicted by the c1 code and by using the upper limits to the production rates in the c2 and c3 codes , described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "besides predicting detailed values for the abundances of the light nuclei @xmath58h , @xmath2he , @xmath59he , and @xmath1li , standard bbn also predicts that the first collapsed objects in the universe should form in a metal free gas .",
    "in fact , carbon is produced along inefficient paths involving intermediate mass elements , in particular @xmath14b rather than the usual @xmath60 reaction in stars .",
    "very small traces of nitrogen and oxygen are then produced by radiative capture upon @xmath34c .",
    "these predictions are relevant for determining the physical mechanisms regulating the collapse of the clouds leading to the popiii stars , and the evolution of the smallest among these pristine stars .    given the relevance of this topic , and the incompleteness of standard bbn nuclear networks in the mass range @xmath617 , we have performed a detailed study of the synthesis channels of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "we have added to the standard code 4 nuclides and more than 100 reactions observing no sensible increase of cno elements .",
    "re - analysing the synthesis of cno after the addition of the new reactions we find that the main channels for their production are basically the same as before and none of the newly added reactions / nuclides opens effective channels from light to heavy elements in bbn .",
    "we consider this as a robust check that only negligible traces of metals are produced in _ standard _",
    "bbn , in agreement with earlier and less accurate analyses .",
    "this should be regarded as a further observational test for standard bbn , since alternative theories like inhomogeneous bbn might lead to primordial metallicities even larger than @xmath62 of the solar value ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
