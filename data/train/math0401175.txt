    "a phylogenetic tree is a rooted tree @xmath3 on @xmath2 nodes with a @xmath4-ary random variable @xmath5 associated to every node .",
    "write @xmath6 for the parent of node @xmath7",
    ". then the transition probabilities between @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given by a @xmath4 by @xmath4 matrix @xmath8 for every non - root node of @xmath3 .",
    "in an application , @xmath4 might encode the four nucleic acids that make up dna , the two families of nucleic acids , or the twenty amino acids .",
    "the transition matrices are generally picked from some specific family such as the jukes - cantor @xcite , kimura @xcite , or general markov models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the homogeneous markov model where all @xmath8 are equal , all nodes are binary ( @xmath9 ) and observable , and the root has uniform distribution .",
    "we write @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of observing @xmath11 at a node @xmath7 is computed from the parent of @xmath7 by @xmath12 we are interested in the algebraic relations satisfied by the joint distribution @xmath13 writing the joint distribution in terms of the model parameters @xmath14 we have @xmath15 where the nodes of the tree are labeled @xmath16 to @xmath2 starting with the root .",
    "that is , the probability of observing a certain labeling of the tree is the product of the @xmath17 that correspond to the transitions on all edges of the tree .",
    "the indeterminates @xmath17 parameterize a toric variety of dimension 4 in @xmath18 .",
    "we let @xmath19 be the corresponding toric ideal , called the ideal of phylogenetic invariants . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the toric ideal @xmath19 is specified by the 4 by @xmath20 configuration @xmath21 , where column @xmath22 consists of the exponent vector of the @xmath17 in ( [ eq : toricdef ] ) .",
    "we order the rows @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the convex hull of the columns of @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in two questions from @xcite .",
    "first , which relations on the joint probabilities @xmath25 does the model imply ?",
    "this problem is solved by giving generators of the ideal of invariants @xmath19 .    in section  2 ,",
    "we study the generators of this ideal .",
    "our main accomplishment is the computation of grbner and markov bases for trees with 11 nodes .",
    "these are computations in 2048 indeterminants , which we believe to be the largest number of indeterminants ever in a grbner basis calculation .",
    "we also calculate generating sets for all trees on at most 9 nodes . based on this evidence",
    ", we conjecture that if @xmath3 is binary , then the ideal @xmath19 has a quadratic generating set , and furthermore , that relations of degree @xmath2 are necessary to generate @xmath19 for certain trees with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "our second goal is to determine , given a labeling of the tree @xmath3 , if we can identify parameters @xmath17 such that the labeling is the most likely among all labelings",
    "? this problem is solved by computing the normal fan of the toric variety in the sense of @xcite .    in section  3 ,",
    "we study this normal fan and the polytope @xmath24 .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ thm:1 ] , is an explicit description of the polytope @xmath24 for an infinite family of binary trees . for this family",
    ", @xmath24 always has 8 vertices and 6 facets which we characterize .",
    "we also present extensive calculations of @xmath24 for various trees and conjecture that there is a bound on the number of vertices of @xmath24 as @xmath3 ranges over all binary trees .",
    "the invariants vanish for a given distribution @xmath26 essentially when that distribution comes from our model .",
    "thus the knowledge of the generators of this ideal is potentially very useful for fitting biological sequence data to a phylogenetic tree , as first noted by cavender and felsenstein @xcite . while there has been much progress towards finding the ideal of invariants for other phylogenetic models ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the homogeneous model is particularly attractive because the low number of parameters makes it possible to compute non - trivial examples .",
    "hopefully we can use the homogeneous model to approximate in some sense the general model , perhaps by subdividing edges of the tree .",
    "[ ex:1 ] let @xmath3 be a path with 3 nodes .",
    "then @xmath27 the polytope @xmath24 has 7 vertices and 6 facets , and the toric ideal of the path of length 3 is generated by 6 binomials @xmath28",
    "the toric ideals @xmath19 are homogeneous , since all monomials in ( [ eq : toricdef ] ) have the same degree @xmath29 . thus they define projective toric varieties @xmath30 .",
    "algebraic geometers usually require a toric variety to be normal , but the reader should be warned that the toric varieties discussed in this paper are generally not normal .",
    "recall that a projective toric variety given by a configuration @xmath31 is covered by the affine toric varieties given by @xmath32 . an affine toric variety defined by a configuration @xmath33",
    "is said to be smooth if the semigroup @xmath34 is isomorphic to @xmath35 for some @xmath36 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.2 ) .",
    "the projective toric variety @xmath30 of a binary tree @xmath3 is not smooth .",
    "recall that the columns of the configuration @xmath21 are indexed by @xmath37-labelings of the tree @xmath3 .",
    "look at the affine chart @xmath38 , where @xmath39 corresponds to the all zero tree . on this chart ,",
    "write @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the tree with a 1 at the root and zeros everywhere else , @xmath42 be the tree with a 1 at a single leaf and zeros everywhere else , and @xmath43 be the tree with a single 1 at the parent of a leaf and zeros elsewhere . then since @xmath44",
    ", we have @xmath45 and so we see that @xmath46 therefore , @xmath47 is not isomorphic to @xmath48 and the toric variety @xmath30 is not smooth .",
    "we are primarily interested in the generators of the ideals @xmath19 .",
    "knowledge of the generators would allow us to easily compute whether given data came from the homogeneous markov model from some specific phylogenetic tree .    using 4ti2 @xcite , grbner and markov bases for the ideal @xmath19 were computed for all trees with at most 9 nodes as well as selected trees with 10 and 11 nodes .",
    "this took about 6 weeks of computer time in total on a 2ghz computer .",
    "the computations in 2048 variables ( trees with 11 nodes ) each took as long as a week and required over 2 gb of memory .",
    "details about the markov bases for all binary trees with at most 11 nodes are shown in table  1 .",
    "these computations lead us to make the following conjectures .",
    ".degree of @xmath19 , number of minimal generators , and maximum degree of the generators [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     there is a bound on the number of vertices of @xmath24 , where @xmath3 ranges over all binary trees",
    ". however , for an arbitrary tree , the number of vertices of @xmath24 is unbounded .    to extend these computations , a better algorithm for computing",
    "@xmath24 needs to be developed .",
    "the naive algorithm for computing @xmath24 involves a loop of size @xmath20 , elimination of duplicates points , and a convex hull computation .",
    "this algorithm can certainly be improved , but it is not known whether there is a polynomial time algorithm for constructing the polytope given a tree .",
    "is there a fast algorithm that , given a tree @xmath3 and a point of @xmath49 , outputs whether that point arises from a labeling of @xmath3 ?",
    "if so , then @xmath24 could be constructed by testing the @xmath50 points inside @xmath29 times the unit simplex .",
    "the author is grateful for useful conversations with seth sullivant , lior pachter , and bernd sturmfels and for much help from raymond hemmecke in fine tuning 4ti2 for these computations .",
    "the polytopal computations were done with polymake .",
    "the author was supported by a national defense science and engineering graduate fellowship ."
