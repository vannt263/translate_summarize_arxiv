    "in the composite fermion ( cf ) picture of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect , fundamental interactions are taken into account at the mean field level by mapping the system of strongly interacting 2d electrons in magnetic field into a system of weakly interacting composite fermions ( cf ) moving in a reduced effective magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the reduction in magnetic field follows from the binding of @xmath1 flux quanta to electrons , so that effective magnetic field experienced by cf quasiparticles is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer that enumerates members of a particular sequence and @xmath1 is a even integer that labels different sequences . in this picture , the fqh effect can be understood by the emergence of cf landau levels with cyclotron frequency : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an effective cf mass .",
    "evidence for a spin split landau level structure of cf for the @xmath6 sequence has been provided by magnetotransport experiments in tilted magnetic fields at filling factors near @xmath7 @xcite and by inelastic light scattering studies of spin excitations in the range @xmath8 @xcite . for the @xmath9 sequence ( i.e. @xmath0 ) , however , direct evidence for such cf landau level structure is lacking .",
    "studies of the @xmath9 sequence are more difficult because of the higher magnetic fields that are required and , compared to the @xmath6 sequence , the smaller energy scales in the excitations .",
    "insight on the energy scales for excitations were revealed by activated transport measurements @xcite and by the recent observations of @xmath9 quasiparticle excitations in light scattering experiments @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present a resonant inelastic light scattering study of spin excitations for @xmath0 .",
    "the excitations are spin waves ( sw ) and spin - flip ( sf ) modes .",
    "the sf excitations involve a change in both the spin orientation and cf landau level quantum number .",
    "we monitor the evolution of these spin excitations below and away from @xmath10 when the population of the excited cf landau level increases .",
    "our results reveal the existence of spin split cf landau levels in the @xmath9 sequence .",
    "the sw - sf splitting is linear in magnetic field .",
    "this determination suggests an effective mass significantly larger than the activation mass of cf with @xmath9 .",
    "the 2d electron ( 2des ) system studied here is a gaas single quantum well of width @xmath11 .",
    "the electron density at small magnetic fields is n=5.5@xmath1210@xmath13  @xmath14 and the low temperature mobility is @xmath15=7.2@xmath1210@xmath16/vs .",
    "the sample is mounted in a backscattering geometry , making an angle @xmath17 between the incident photons and the normal to the sample surface .",
    "the magnetic field perpendicular to the sample is b = b@xmath18cos@xmath17 , where b@xmath18 is the total applied field .",
    "the results reported here have been obtained at @xmath17=50@xmath192 degrees .",
    "similar results have been seen at 30 degrees @xcite.the ingoing and outgoing polarizations were chosen to be orthogonal ( depolarized spectra ) since excitations which involve a change in the spin degrees of freedom are stronger in this configuration .",
    "the sample was cooled in a dilution refrigerator with windows for optical access .",
    "all the measurements were performed at the base temperature t=23  mk and the power density was kept below 10@xmath20w/@xmath21 to avoid heating the electron system .",
    "the energy of the incident photons was tuned to be in resonance with the excitonic optical transitions of the 2des in the fqh regime @xcite .",
    "figure [ spectres ] shows the evolution of the low energy spectrum for @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to a perpendicular field of 6.5 t and the filling factor range studied corresponds to the range 0.31@xmath220.33 .",
    "close to @xmath10 , the spectra are dominated by the long wavelength sw at the bare zeeman energy e@xmath23 , where g=0.44 is the lande factor for electrons in gaas and @xmath24 is the bohr magneton . for filling factors away from @xmath10",
    "an excitation emerges on the low energy side of e@xmath25 .",
    "we assign this excitation to a sf mode linked to transitions in the cf framework that involve the first excited cf landau level as depicted in figure [ levels ] . at @xmath10 the first cf landau ( @xmath26 ) level",
    "is fully occupied while for @xmath27 the first two cf landau levels ( @xmath26 and @xmath28 ) are occupied . in between the two incompressible states ,",
    "the first excited landau level is partially populated and sf transitions between @xmath28 and @xmath29 starting from the partially filled level become possible .",
    "thus the study of the sf excitations in the filling factor range 2/7@xmath221/3 probe directly the cf level structure for @xmath9 .    for small occupation of the @xmath28 excited level and when",
    "the coupling between the excited quasiparticle and its quasihole is negligible , the sf transition energy can be written as in the @xmath6 case : @xmath30 where e@xmath31 is the spin reversal energy which is a measure of the residual interactions between @xmath9 cf quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the energy e@xmath32 was extracted for each filling factor by performing a simple analysis of the low energy spectra using a two - gaussian fitting procedure as shown in the inset of figure [ spectres ] .",
    "figure [ energies ] displays the corresponding energies , e@xmath25 and e@xmath32 as a function of filling factor .",
    "the strong dependence of e@xmath32 confirms our assignment of the peak as excitation involving spin degrees of freedom .",
    "more importantly , the spacing between e@xmath25 and e@xmath32 is not constant and decreases with the filling factor . from equation [ esf ] , we easily see that this spacing is directly related to the cf cyclotron energy so that the splitting between the two spin excitations is e@xmath25-e@xmath32=@xmath33-e@xmath31 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the e@xmath25-e@xmath32 spacing is set by the effective field b@xmath34 . for the @xmath6 sequence ,",
    "@xmath35cf emanate from the @xmath36 state and the effective field has its origin at b@xmath37 .",
    "for the @xmath9 sequence however , @xmath38cf emanate from the @xmath39=1/4 state and the origin is at b@xmath40 .",
    "and the effective magnetic field should then decrease when going from 0.33 to 0.31 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with our data and to the existence of @xmath38cf or @xmath9 spin - flip excitations below @xmath39=1/3 .",
    "our results support the cf landau level picture shown figure [ levels ] for the @xmath9 sequence .",
    "the linear decrease of e@xmath25-e@xmath32 with the effective magnetic field makes very tempting the evaluation of an effective mass by using a slope that is simply given by @xmath41 in the framework of equation [ esf ] for e@xmath32 . our data between filling factors 0.33 and 0.31 give m@xmath42=1.5(@xmath43 )",
    "m@xmath44 where m@xmath44 is the bare electron mass .",
    "previous determinations using the activation gap values at @xmath39=2/7 , 3/11 and 4/15 on samples with similar densities yield values around 0.9  m@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we note that while our determination of m@xmath42 is performed between @xmath39=0.33 and @xmath39=0.31 , i.e. in between the incompressible states at 1/3 and 2/7 , the effective mass determined via transport measurements comes from a linear scaling of the activation gap values at the incompressible states . the high effective mass obtained in our analysis",
    "may be linked to the onset of significant cf interactions in the partially populated cf landau level .",
    "additional insights can be obtained by tracking the evolution of the intensity of the sf excitation when the population of the first excited cf level increases .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ intensities ] where the integrated spectral weight of the sf excitation is plotted as a function of filling factor . as expected , the sf intensity increases when the population of @xmath28 increases but displays an intriguing saturation around below @xmath39=0.32 .",
    "as already mentioned for the effective mass , the saturation may result from increasing impact of cf residual interactions .",
    "these interactions could possibly lead to further condensation into higher order cf in the partially populated level .",
    "recent transport measurements have indeed shown the possible existence of such higher order states even for the @xmath1=4 sequence @xcite .",
    "in this study , we have shown the existence of spin - flip excitations of @xmath38cf quasiparticle below @xmath39=1/3 .",
    "the results indicate the existence of a spin - split cf landau level structure for the @xmath9 sequence of the fractional quantum hall effect that is similar to the one found for the @xmath6 sequence .",
    "the evolution of the sf energy with effective magnetic field yields an effective mass of 1.5m@xmath44 .",
    "the evolution of the sf intensity with filling factor might signal the onset of significant cf - cf interactions that could possibly lead to further cf condensation .",
