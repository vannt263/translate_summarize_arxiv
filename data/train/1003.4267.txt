    "any finite temperature causes the major axis of the ensuing ellipse to exceed with its apices the spherical confinement and , hence , forces the polymer to buckle . the elastic bending energy would be smallest if the ellipse s apices both rest on an equatorial plane .",
    "namely , such a configuration maximizes the distance between the apices and , hence , minimizes the curvature of the state . disregarding rotational symmetry",

    "this increase in entropy clearly goes at the expense of stronger bending .",

    "we take the dsc of a polymer ring to nestle half its total height @xmath57 below an equatorial plane and the other half above . employing pythagoras law the total length of the major axis",

    "if eventually the major axis is compressed by the confining cavity the polymer ring buckles as an elastic response .",
    "here entropy again takes action as it shifts the plane in which the ring is compressed from the energetically favorable equatorial plane to smaller radii . at last ,",
    "due to the broad distribution of polymer configurations the transition to buckling is premature and smooth .",
    "these four effects are sufficient to explain the form of polymer rings in weak spherical confinement as shown by comparison of shape parameters calculated from our analytic description and averaged simulation data .    our analytic description ,",
    "hence , gives a faithful representation of stiff polymer ring conformations and the scaling of the principal polymer axes , especially the scaling of the buckling height , with polymer flexibility .",
    "as our analytic argument accounts beyond polymer flexibility for different radii of confinement , the dominant polymer conformation is now available for active control by these two experimentally adjustable factors . employing our results in biomimetic experiments , biological processes , that are strongly dependent on polymer configuration , can be investigated under well defined conditions .",
