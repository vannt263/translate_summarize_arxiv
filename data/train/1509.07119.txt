    "the study of dense stellar systems , which mainly refers to young massive star clusters , globular clusters and ultra - compact dwarf galaxies , has played an important role in developing our knowledge about the universe .",
    "since most stars in the galactic disc may originate in embedded star clusters , these systems can be viewed as the fundamental building blocks of galaxies to understand the origins of the properties of the galactic stellar population , such as the galaxy - wide stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "the internal properties of star clusters can undergo significant changes at birth and also during the course of cluster evolution .",
    "hence , it is important to specify to what amount the current properties of star clusters are imprinted at the beginning of the evolution and early formation processes and to what amount they are the result of long - term evolutionary processes ( vesperini 2010 ) .",
    "in fact , star formation provides the initial conditions for the long - term evolution of stellar clusters , while the follow up dynamics of stars in clusters can inform on the conditions that have dominated in the environment in which the clusters have formed .",
    "the stars of star clusters are born more or less simultaneously within the dense cores of the same progenitor giant molecular cloud .",
    "stars within an embedded cluster form following an initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the shape of the stellar imf is one of the main uncertainties in our understanding of star formation , i.e. , the conversion of gas into stars over cosmic time .",
    "it is usually assumed that the imf in external galaxies is the same as in the disk of the milky way , where most studies of resolved stellar populations showed the imf to be invariant ( bastian et al .",
    "2010 , kroupa et al .",
    "the imf is also observationally found to be invariant for nearly all dense systems in which its shape could be inferred and which formed with a star formation density below a threshold near @xmath4 and is hence referred to as the `` standard '' or `` canonical '' imf .",
    "this poses a problem for star formation theories which predict a dependence on the environment where star formation takes place ( kroupa et al 2013 ) .    in the course of time",
    ", the mf of stars in clusters evolves at early stages and also during the cluster secular evolution as the stellar members are removed from the system through stellar and dynamical evolution ( vesperini & heggie 1997 , baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .",
    "simulations show that mass segregation and the preferential loss of low - mass stars which leads to a shallower mass function should only happen after a cluster has gone into two - body relaxation - driven core - collapse which is connected to the shrinkage of the core size @xmath5 ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .",
    "so one would expect a correlation between mf - slope , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the salpeter index ) , and concentration parameter ( @xmath9 ) , in the sense that clusters with large values of @xmath10 are depleted in low - mass stars ( fig . 4 in leigh et al .",
    "2013 ) . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath12 to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath5 are the tidal and core radius , respectively .",
    "but , according to observational data by de marchi , paresce , & pulone ( 2007 ) , and @xcite for galactic globular clusters the value of @xmath6 , in the mass range 0.3 - 0.8 @xmath15 , correlates surprisingly with their concentration parameter , such that the less concentrated clusters are typically but not exclusively more strongly depleted in low mass stars .",
    "this trend can not be understood to be the result of long - term evolution alone and at least some initial correlation between the initial concentration and the total cluster mass is required ( leigh et al 2013 ) .",
    "the de marchi relation could be interpreted as a first evidence for a non - universality of the imf at low masses , but baumgardt et al ( 2008a ) showed that such a correlation can be understood if clusters are born initially mass segregated with a canonical imf , but are filling their tidal radii .",
    "the difficulty of this scenario is that the cluster would have to form with knowledge of its mass - dependent tidal radius at different locations in a galaxy .",
    "it is unclear how star formation can arrange this .",
    "marks et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , however , demonstrated , using n - body integrations of young , gas embedded compact clusters , that the loss of the primordial residual - gas from initially mass - segregated clusters in a range of tidal field strenghts starting with a canonical imf and containing unresolved binaries reasonably reproduces the relation between the slope of the actual mass function and the concentration of globular clusters within the observational limits .",
    "the flattening of the mf - slope driven by a violent early phase of gas - expulsion of an embedded cluster with primordial mass segregation can also be a possible explanation for the observed flattened mass function of some remote halo globular clusters like for example , palomar 4 and palomar 14 ( zonoozi et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 )    in this paper , our aim is to consider the effect of primordial residual - gas expulsion on the early evolution of globular clusters ( covering the first 100 myr of their evolution ) and it s influence on the stellar mf - slope and degree of mass segregation for a wide range of stellar masses , varying the star formation efficiency , and the strength of the external tidal field .",
    "contrary to the otherwise identical models studied by marks et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we here use a fully realistic distribution of stellar masses .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we discuss the star cluster reaction to residual - gas expulsion . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the initial set - up of the n - body models and in sec .",
    "4 we present the main results of the simulations .",
    "finally sec .",
    "5 consists of the conclusions and a discussion .",
    "the fraction of gas that is converted into stars within the volume of the embedded cluster is defined as the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stellar mass of the embedded cluster and @xmath18 is the residual gas within the cluster . a large",
    "sfe leads to more stars and therefore also to more massive stars with stronger winds and radiation and there is less gas to remove .",
    "the observationally determined sfe is usually smaller than @xmath19 ( lada & lada 2003 ) so most of the mass of the progenitor cloud remains in the form of residual gas to be expelled .    in young ,",
    "still gas - embedded star clusters , the left - over gas from star formation is lost over a time which is determined by feedback from massive stars through uv radiation and massive stellar winds from ob stars or supernova explosions .",
    "thus , star clusters will become super - virial and their further dynamical evolution will be strongly affected by the gas loss .",
    "recent observations indicate that proto - stars form in molecular clouds as complex and filamentary substructures .",
    "however , as shown in banerjee & kroupa ( 2015 ) , if a young star cluster has to form out of them , they must fall in the potential well of the molecular cloud and form a near - spherical and nearly virialized cluster within a few dynamical times , which is short ( or similar ) compared to the typical gas dispersal time that we take here ( @xmath20 myr ) .",
    "observational evidence for such a monolithic formation of individual massive cluster rather than a hierarchical formation of successively merging of small - clusters is provided by the @xmath21 , and @xmath22 pc sized molecular cloud formed in the antennae merging galaxies by johnson et al .",
    "hence , our initial conditions , that comprise virialized embedded clusters , are plausible .",
    "as suggested by some recent theoretical studies involving hydrodynamic calculations , e.g. , dale et al .",
    "( 2015 , 2012 ) , the locations at which the protostars ( or sink particles ) are formed , the star formation efficiency is nearly @xmath23 and so the removal of gas is less efficient in further dynamics , arguing against gas - expulsion as being a relevant physical process that governs the long - term evolution of a cluster .",
    "this is likely to be a result of including only radiative feedback and ignoring magnetic fields as well as performing simulations in which the sink particles are significantly more massive than individual stars .",
    "however , according to the high resolution hydrodynamic calculations by machida & maatsumoto ( 2012 ) and bate et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and direct observation ( lada & lada 2003 ) only small fraction of gas convert into stars .",
    "based on the hydrodynamical simulations without feedback , @xcite also claimed that the sfe is higher in the regions where stars have formed , and hence the long - term evolution of star clusters is only weakly affected by gas removal .",
    "they argued that this is because of the low gas fractions within the pre - cluster cloud core , caused by the accretion of gas on to the stars . in this case",
    "it however needs to be explained how the outer parts of the gas cloud are expelled without heating and pushing out the inner gas contents of the pre - cluster cloud core .",
    "it also is difficult to explain ultracompact hii regions if gas can simply be accreted onto the stars despite their luminosity . in the short - lived uchii phase ,",
    "the gas is heated significantly ( up to @xmath24 k or more ) in the immediate surrounding of the stars ( within @xmath25 pc ) , which then leads to an outflow of the residual gas on larger scales .",
    "however , in the simulations by @xcite including the influence of photoionizing radiation from o - type stars it is shown that the global sfe is between 20 - 30% and agrees with what is observed in star - forming regions and embedded clusters which suggests that the star formation efficiency can at most be @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , lada & lada 2003 ) , although on the scale of whole molecular clouds the star formation efficiency is at most a few percent ( murray 2011 ) .",
    "high - resolution mapping in star - forming regions has uncovered that outflows , even from low - mass proto - stars , are very powerful in destroying and clearing cloud material away from the star - forming region on sub - ps scales ( e.g. , bally et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 , mcgroarty et al .",
    "2004 , frank et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "in addition , the dynamical state of the stars at the onset of gas expulsion might be a key factor in determining the effects of gas expulsion @xcite .",
    "for example , by means of n - body simulations of highly non - equilibrium star clusters in fixed background potential ( as a simple model of gas potential ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that the long - term dynamical evolution of star clusters is affected by the initial stellar distribution and velocity dispersion far more than by gas expulsion .",
    "they have shown that initially cool clusters are more able to survive gas expulsion , weakening the dependency of survival to gas expulsion on the initial sfe compared to a virialised initial dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "such an ansatz however requires all stars to have formed in some volume synchronically on a time - scale much shorter than the dynamical time - scale of this volume , which appears to be an artificial initial state .",
    "further discussion of this issue is available in kroupa ( 2005 ) .",
    "observations of uchii regions , of outflows and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of star formation show that the sfe does not surpass about 20 - 30% on a sub - pc scale because matter is blown out in outflows launched by the magnetic fields .",
    "this questions the above mentioned results according to which gas - removal is not important .",
    "the main argument here is that actual proto - star scale high - resolution mhd calculations ( e.g. , machida & maatsumoto 2012 , bate et al . 2014 ) show that the interplay between gas accretion onto the protostar and magnetically driven outflow results in star formation efficiencies up to @xmath27 in the neighborhood of proto - stars , which is a well sub - pc scale .",
    "this would imply the overall sfe in a dense gas clump ( sub - pc to pc scale ) would be less than 30% , including its innermost regions .",
    "such proto - star scale calculations are the only available ones that can track the mass accretion and outflow ( driven by radiation and magnetic field ) from individual proto - stars .",
    "other more massive sph simulations , that intend to form star clusters , either exclude all feedback or include only partial feedback .",
    "the sfe from these calculations can never be reliable . the dale et al .",
    "( 2015 ) calculations that go up to globular cluster masses had their sink particle representing a sub - cluster itself , i.e. , their sink particles themselves are of pc scale .",
    "of course , with a 30% sfe all over the clump ( the sfe can , in practice , be smaller in the outer regions ) , gas expulsion should have a significant impact on the cluster .",
    "this is the initial star - to - gas ratio that we plausibly adopt in our computations .",
    "we assume that the gas expulsion starts after the embedded phase at a certain time , @xmath28 , which is set equal to @xmath29 myr and corresponds to the uchii phase .",
    "after this time , it is assumed that the mass of gas decreases exponentially on the gas - expulsion characteristic time scale @xmath30 , over which the natal gas is removed from the cluster .",
    "so the time - varying total mass in gas is given by    @xmath31    the impact of the early gas expulsion on the early dynamical evolution of star clusters has been investigated by baumgardt & kroupa ( 2007 ) using a large set of n - body integration .",
    "they showed that the survival rate and final properties of star clusters are strongly influenced by the details of the expulsion of the residual - gas that did not form stars , depending on the parameter values for the gas - expulsion time scale , @xmath30 , the star formation efficiency , @xmath32 , and the ratio of the initial half - mass radius to tidal radius .",
    "they also found that if the tidal field is weak ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the half - mass radius ) and the gas is removed slowly ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the crossing time defined here as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the 3d velocity dispersion in the cluster ) , star clusters can survive even if the sfe is as low as @xmath39 .",
    "it is shown here that the gas - free stellar system ( after gas expulsion ) expands violently and loses a fraction of its stars depending on its initial mass and concentration if @xmath40 and @xmath30 is the thermal gas removal timescale .",
    "we take @xmath41 , where 10 km / s is the approximate sound velocity of the ionized gas .",
    "studying the dynamical effect of gas dispersal by adopting a time - varying background potential mimicking the influence of the gas with the above values for @xmath28 @xmath30 and @xmath32 is used by banerjee & kroupa ( 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ) to explain well observed very young massive clusters such as r136 and the ngc 3603 , and the onc is likewise well accounted for using these values as a currently expanding population leading to a pleiades - like open cluster in @xmath42 ( kroupa et al .",
    "the conformity of these values to account for observed clusters of masses @xmath43 , @xmath24 , and @xmath44 suggests a common physical process which acts in their emergence from their embedded stage .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_regular ]",
    "the effective dynamical influence of gas - removal from embedded clusters is included as modeling the gas as an additive time - varying potential and accordingly modifying the equations of motion of the stars @xcite .",
    "i.e. , the gas was not simulated directly , instead we mimic the essential dynamical effects of the gas - expulsion process by applying a diluting , spherically - symmetric external gravitational potential to a model cluster .",
    "specifically , we use the potential of the spherically - symmetric , time - varying mass distribution as described by eq .",
    "2 . comparing computations treating the gas with the sph method , geyer & burkert ( 2001 ) have demonstrated that such an analytical approach is physically realistic .",
    "the models presented here assume the pre - gas expulsion stellar plus gas configuration of the cluster models to be in virial equilibrium .",
    "this is a simplifying assumption which is necessary to make the models computable , because treating the gas component with a magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) and radiation - transfer code including stellar feedback ( i.e. , radiation and matter out flows ) to the star forming gas is computationally impossible even for a small cluster of mass larger than about @xmath45 ( klessen et al .",

    "the earliest phases of embedded cluster assembly are given by the simultaneous inward flow of gas , driven by the deepening potential well of the embryonic embedded cluster , and by the nearly - simultaneous outflow of gas driven by the increasing stellar feedback and magnetic fields generated in the proto - stellar accretion disks .",
    "we use the state - of - the - art collisional @xmath0-body integration code nbody6 ( aarseth 2003 ) on gpu computers to perform direct n - body simulations .",
    "nbody6 uses a 4th - order hermite integration scheme and an individual timestep algorithm to follow the orbits of cluster members and invokes regularization schemes to deal with the internal evolution of small - n subsystems .",

    "the degree of segregation ( parameterized by @xmath57 ) can be chosen to be between 0 and 1 , where @xmath58 means no segregation and @xmath59 refers to full segregation , i.e.   the most massive star sitting in the lowest energy orbit and the second - most massive stars sitting in the second - lowest energy orbit , and so on . this routine allows to maintain the desired density profile when increasing the degree of mass segregation while also making sure that the cluster is in virial equilibrium .",

    "( 2015 ) used the final state of sph simulations of star formation which include feedback from photoionization and stellar winds as the initial condition of their n - body simulations and found that after 10 myr of evolution , primordial mass segregation is less common in the simulations when star formation occurs under the influence of feedback .",
    "they found that the ten most massive stars are mass segregated , rather than full mass segregation of the whole cluster .",
    "these simulations concern low - mass clusters with very simplified treatment of feedback , such that it is unclear how indicative they are .",
    "for example , the outflows launched even by low - mass stars appear to be destructive on a cloud scale .",
    "observations of some young clusters such as onc ( allison et al 2009 ) , ngc3603 ( pang et al 2013 ) and trumpler 14 ( sana 2010 ) have shown these clusters to be mass segregated down to around the 4@xmath60 , 20@xmath60 , and 6@xmath60 most massive stars , respectively , rather than primordial mass segregation of the whole cluster . thus , while the complete mass segregation in young clusters has not been observed yet , in this paper , we aim to address possible initial conditions of star - burst clusters in a totally different mass regime a hubble time ago in low - metallicity gas .    in our calculations , we assume that the sfe does not depend on the position inside the cluster , so both stellar and gaseous components follow the same density distribution initially , which is given by a plummer model with similar radius .",
    "using a plummer model is a reasonable physical choice because it is the simplest solution of the collisionless boltzman equation and also adequately describes the simplest stellar - dynamical objects , globular clusters , known to exist ( plummer 1911 ) we assume different sfes : @xmath61 .",

    "the mass - loss in the beginning of the evolution is dominated by gas expulsion and early mass - loss associated with stellar evolution of massive stars , such that clusters lose about 30% of their mass within the first 100 myr by early stellar evolution . moreover , in the framework of our model , the evolution of a star cluster is affected by several parameters related to the details of the gas expulsion process ( like e.g. , star formation efficiency , @xmath32 , and gas expulsion time scale , @xmath30 ) as well as the strength of the external tidal field , quantified by the ratio of the initial half - mass radius of a star cluster to its tidal radius , @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , the presence of primordial mass segregation significantly affects the global dynamical evolution of star clusters .",
    "in tidally limited clusters , primordial mass segregation leads to a stronger expansion , and hence a larger flow of mass over the tidal boundary @xcite . it may therefore help to dissolve them more rapidly .",
    "tidally - underfilling clusters , however , can survive this early expansion ( vesperini et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the degree of primordial mass segregation and the strength of the tidal field of the host galaxy are therefore a crucial parameter in the early evolution of gcs .",
    "we therefore compare the evolution of the mf of the clusters by changing the strength of the external field and degree of initial mass segregation .",
    "table 1 gives an overview of the simulations performed .",
    "we first start with one model without primordial segregation ( rh10-s0-sfe25 ) . in order to see the maximum effect of residual - gas expulsion , we set the initial half - mass radius of the modeled cluster to @xmath64 pc , and",

    "just a very slight decrease of the slope due to two - body relaxation driven evaporation of stars occurs in the mass range @xmath73 .",

    "it can be seen that the mf flattening occurs on a much longer timescale for the non - mass - segregated system .",
    "we assigned a quite extreme degree of segregation of @xmath74 for all primordially segregated models , in order to show the maximum influence mass segregation can realistically have .",
    "because of stellar evolution post gas - expulsion clusters experience a further expansion such that clusters with a higher degree of primordial mass segregation experience a larger jump in the half - mass radius within the first 100 myr of evolution .",

    "[ alpha ] would continue well beyond 100 myr and will _ moderately _ change their positions in the @xmath99 diagram , they will still be consistent with the mpp trend since the latter has some scatter anyway .",
    "this is because the estimated two - body relaxation times for all models with an altered mf are larger than one - third of the hubble time at @xmath100 myr .",
    "therefore , the @xmath71 values will likely decline further due to unbound escaping stars over the intended mass range still remaining within @xmath14 .",
    "our simulations show that only in the case where a cluster ends up with a very large @xmath63 , will the low mass stars leave the cluster .",
    "note that all clusters in table 1 which have a significantly altered mf due to gas expulsion end up with final 3d half - mass radii of about @xmath10121 pc .",

    "the present - day population ii halo gcs which formed with a higher metallicity , and thus typically after the gcs with a lower metallicity , most probably formed in an environment which had larger fluctuations in the tidal field ( marks & kroupa 2010 , their fig .",
    "also , during the first few gyr the mw did not exist in the way we know it today .",
    "observations have revealed that the size and the mass content of galaxies change significantly with redshift such that the sizes of the galaxies at high redshifts are smaller in comparison with galaxies of similar mass in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "i.e. , the fluctuation in the pre - mw potential grew with time as it began assembling during the first few gyr and it is only during the past 8 - 10 gyr that the mw finally settled down in the form we know it today .",
    "so , when the gcs were relatively young , their environment would have been much more dramatic . some , but not all , of these gcs would have formed in a strong local tidal field such that they lost a significant fraction of their stellar population as a result of the expulsion of their residual gas .",
    "for example , a very young gc with a mass of @xmath103 would have formed with an embedded half - mass radius of about 0.8 pc ( assuming the radius - mass relation of marks & kroupa 2012 ) .",
    "expulsion of 67  per cent of unused gas would lead to an expansion to a half - mass radius of about 3  pc , and further expansion through stellar evolution would continue . if the imf was top - heavy ( marks et al .",
    "2012 ) , then the expansion would be larger still .",
    "if this young gc was mass - segregated and immersed in a tidal field from a nearby extremely massive molecular cloud with a mass of , for example , @xmath104 , which is in the process of forming another gc , then the tidal radius would be @xmath105pc such that this gc would have had @xmath106 if it was located @xmath107pc away from the cloud .",
    "such events and configurations would have persisted during the first 0.5 - 1  gyr of the evolution of the proto - mw and the above case would exist for 10100  myr given that the just - hatched gc would be approximately co - moving with the evolving nearby molecular clouds during half an orbit through the forming proto - mw .",
    "present - day instances of such processes and events are evident in the antennae galaxies where massive star cluster complexes containing hundreds of massive clusters within region with a diameter of 300 pc are forming @xcite .",
    "since the young gcs did not form in a smooth environment , they must have been exposed to strongly fluctuating tidal fields in the very early pre - mw potential .",
    "`` r136 '' is a good example : it is the most massive compact cluster in a whole cluster complex .",
    "there are many lesser clusters that formed in the `` r136 '' star - burst region .",
    "the `` arches '' cluster is in fact in a very strong tidal field , and most probably also did not form alone .",
    "however , these cases are almost two or three orders of magnitude lesser in mass scale than what was occurring in the very young pre - mw .",
    "so , the damaged gcs ( i.e. , the ones with low @xmath10 and depleted mf ) may well have been the lesser clusters in a star - burst region orders of magnitude more intense than anything in the present - day local universe .",
    "it should be noted that the correlation is not a pure time - sequence .",
    "but the more damaged clusters are typically more metal rich ( marks & kroupa 2010 ) .",
    "this means they typically formed a few hundred myr later than the first , metal poorest clusters which are also least damaged and would have formed in an overall smoother potential ( weaker tidal fields ) and more compact due to the lower metallicity .",
    "the higher@xmath108 $ ] clusters are further inside the mw , which means they formed slightly later and under more violently varying tidal fields , leading to the mpp correlation . note that this correlation only means that at low c ( typically larger [ fe / h ] ) there is a wider spread of alpha values than at high c ( typically lower [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the higher - metallicity clusters typically but not exclusively formed more tidally filling due to larger mass concentrations nearby them , and they formed somewhat deeper in the proto - mw potential .",
    "other mechanisms may contribute to the mpp trend .",
    "for example , by assuming a high retention fraction of stellar - mass bhs after supernovae which prevent the clusters from going into core collapse for nearly a hubble time , @xcite explained the mpp relation without invoking primordial mass segregation and gas expulsion .",
    "they found that a cluster hosting a high number of stellar - mass black holes increases the escape rate of high - mass stars from a star cluster , implying that the relative depletion of the mass function at the low - mass end proceeds less rapidly .",
    "two - body relaxation plus a tidal field , and any process that can modulate the cluster expansion according to concentration ( more concentrated clusters expand less ) can produce a mpp like trend .",
    "furthermore , the observed metallicity trend of the mpp clusters ( more damaged gcs have typically higher @xmath109 $ ] ) needs to be understood in terms of the stellar - mass bh scenario . in the long term , neutron stars ( nss ) will also influence the cluster s expansion .",
    "it is to be noted that the bhs and nss influence mostly the central part of the cluster , the expansion ( and contraction later ) becomes less prominent as one goes outwards . in any case , bhs ( and nss ) can keep the cluster from core collapsing for a long time . their effect in terms of metallicity can be more subtle .",
    "in fact , two opposite trends seem to be there in the @xmath110 $ ] correlation :    * with lower metalicity , bhs are more massive and would expand the cluster more initially and that tends to produce a trend which is opposite to the mpp s @xmath110 $ ] correlation ( marks & kroupa 2010 ) .",
    "* on the other hand , more massive bhs eject each other more efficiently and , in the long run , will be more depleted which is favorable for the metallicity trend .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of stellar remnants in star clusters and their effects are still largely unexplored .",
    "however , straightforward canonical stellar dynamical models have been implying that the mpp relation is unexpected ( leigh et al . 2013 ) unless gas expulsion and mass - segregation at birth with a strongly varying tidal field is taken into account .",
    "as we have shown in a strong - enough tidal environment , a strongly flattened slope of the stellar mf in the low- ( @xmath111 ) and intermediate - mass ( @xmath2 ) regime results after the rapid expansion driven by residual - gas removal and massive star evolution . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ mf_s9rh1]-[mf_s9rh10 ] such a flattening is the exclusive feature that occurs only for initially mass - segregated clusters for both regimes , tidally filling and tidally underfilling",
    ". therefore the imprint of residual gas expulsion , as direct evidence of primordial mass segregation , might be visible in the present - day mf . therefore , this can be interpreted as an observational consequence of gas expulsion on the mf in the low mass end confirming the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , apart from the particular shape ( the dip near @xmath112 ) of the mf in the mass range @xmath111 , a cluster which follows the mf shown in , like e.g. , fig . 4 ( @xmath113 , with @xmath74 ) would end up with a mass - to - light ratio smaller by a factor of @xmath29 ( due to the depletion of low - mass stars and remnants ) compared to the case of fig 1 ( @xmath113 , with @xmath114 ) .",
    "of course , this conclusion depends on the way we set up the initially segregated clusters .",
    "if we initialize clusters such that there is not such a large degree of mass segregation among the low - mass stars , but only the high mass stars are near the cluster centre , the results will be changed . in this section",

    "more massive stars are lost from the cluster due to gas expulsion , while the least massive stars are preferentially accumulated .",

    "we have shown that the mfs of non - segregated clusters still resemble their imfs and that they do not show a strong change of the slope over the whole range of stellar mass over 100 myr of evolution , because stars of all stellar masses are equally affected by gas expulsion .",

    "but the mf in the low - mass part ( @xmath123 ) changes significantly , because primordial mass segregation leads to a larger impact of stellar evolution on cluster expansion and enhances the preferential loss of less massive stars due to two - body relaxation after post - gas expulsion re - virialisation .    on the other hand , primordially mass - segregated tidally - filling clusters with @xmath124 show a strongly depleted mass function in the intermediate stellar mass range ( @xmath81 ) as well as in the low - mass part .",

    "_ if such a behavior in the mf - slope of the low - mass part is observed , this would constitute direct evidence for mass segregation , gas expulsion and a strong tidal field at birth .",
    "_    concerning the dip at the low - mass end of the stellar mass function of fully mass segregated initial clusters , our explanation is that the least massive stars are essentially on radial orbits , since they can not be moving outwards much given that the cluster is in virial equilibrium .",
    "the least massive stars must have the smallest velocity dispersion .",
    "so , they probably fall in , or at least , they are least affected by gas expulsion since they have small velocities , while the more massive stars are lost from the cluster due to gas expulsion .",
    "it should be noted that if the outermost stars predominantly move inwards , that is more of an artefact of how the mass - segregated cluster is set up .",
    "however , even without the infalling nature , a similar feature would have appeared since the outermost ( and lowest mass for a fully mass - segregated cluster ) stars are the slowest .",
    "if gas expulsion is a common process in the early stages of star clusters , then by direct measurement of the slope of the mass function at low stellar mass of very young massive clusters ( @xmath126 myr ) , one can constrain the starting condition of the clusters such as primordial mass segregation . these results",
    "confirm the conclusions reached by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the shape of the mf can constrain the birth place or the birth size of the cluster , because the tidally - underfilling clusters have a falling and then a rising trend in the mf - slope in the low - mass end if they are born _ initially segregated_.    the models with gas expulsion agree with the general trend that less concentrated clusters show a flattened mf .",
    "we note that the mf - slopes and @xmath10 values are determined in the models presented here after 100 myr of evolution , but , since the two - body relaxation time for all models with an altered mf are larger than one - third of the hubble time ( table 1 ) , the position of the clusters in the @xmath127 plane will not significantly change over 10 gyr .",
    "our models constitute a possible solution to the flattened mass function of the two remote halo gcs , pal 4 and 14 ( zonoozi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in our previous publications ( zonoozi et al . 2011 , 2014 )",
    "we have shown that , while two - body relaxation does have an effect on the cluster s stellar mass function , the effect from two - body relaxation is too weak such that the shallow present - day mass function slope measured by jordi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and frank et al .",
    "( 2012 ) can not be reproduced with models starting from a canonical kroupa imf ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observed parameters of globular clusters pal 4 and pal 14 ( i.e. their observed mass functions , mass segregation , half light radii and masses ) can , in principle , be reproduced either by assuming a very high primordial mass segregation , or by assuming an imf already depleted in low - mass stars , compared to the canonical kroupa imf .",
    "we showed that such an initially flattened mass function can be explained by the loss of a good fraction of low - mass stars from an initially mass - segregated embedded cluster across the tidal radius during a violent early residual - gas expulsion phase in agreement with the general findings by marks & kroupa ( 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the flattened imf of pal 4 and 14 we have uncovered strengthens the idea that these clusters formed with a high degree of primordial mass segregation in a stronger tidal field rather than in isolation .",
    "i.e. if pal 4 and 14 have always been on a circular orbit with the present day galactocentric distance , it is hard to imagine that the tidal field would have played a role during the response of the cluster to gas expulsion .",
    "this may have been the case if either the galactic tidal field has since then evolved @xcite , or if the cluster was born within the inner part of our galaxy , and then moved to a larger galactocentric distance on an eccentric orbit , which is more likely than a circular orbit . or , the cluster birth site was a now detached / disrupted tidal dwarf galaxy ( pawlowski et al 2011 ) .",
    "evidence for this scenario would strengthen if these clusters are found to orbit within the vast polar structure ( vpos , pawlowski & kroupa 2014 ) .",
    "thus the two most important new results we arrive at are ( i ) that the observed correlation between concentration and the mf - slope can be accounted for excellently ( fig . 7 ) and",
    "( ii ) that the mf of stars ought to have a minimum at about @xmath128 ( at an age up to @xmath129 myr ) , if gcs formed mass - segregated and suffered gas expulsion in a strongly varying proto - galactic potential .",
    "this confirms the previous conclusions arrived at by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , yielding an important if not essential window towards studying the very early phase of mw assembly .",
    "the approach taken here ( gas expulsion and tidal field ) yields otherwise unobtainable constraints on the very early conditions when the proto - mw was forming .",
    "that is , with this approach , we can obtain constraints on a time - resolution of less than a few hundred myr and on the fluctuations of the very early mw potential .",
    "we emphasize that massive embedded clusters with masses larger than about @xmath130 revirialise rapidly and within a few myr , they expand by a factor of 3 - 4 and loose a small fraction ( at most 20  % in a solar neighborhood tidal field ) of their stellar mass as a result of the blow - out within a thermal time - scale ( with a gas velocity of 10 km / s ) of 67  % of their original embedding gas mass ( brinkmann , banerjee & kroupa , in prep . ; banerjee & kroupa 2014 , 2015 ) . less massive clusters expand more , take a much longer time to revirialise and are much more damaged losing more than 50  % of their stars by gas blow - out as shown by kroupa , aarseth & hurley ( 2003 ) .",
    "thus , for those globular clusters , such as studied in this paper , which have a deficit of low - mass stars to be sufficiently damaged by gas blow - out , they must have been also subject to a strong local tidal field for the outer expanded regions of the cluster to be stripped .",
    "only a fraction of all globular clusters suffered this fate ( marks & kroupa 2010 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that our conclusions in the present paper are based on two major assumptions , that is , primordial mass segregation and residual gas expulsion that are questioned by some authors @xcite .",
    "concerning the debate whether gas expulsion is relevant in the formation of star clusters ( sec .",
    "2 ) , we note the high - precession space - astrometry of the gaia mission is ideally suited to settle this argument , by allowing the kinematical fields around young clusters to be mapped accurately ( kroupa 2005 ) .",
    "simulations with gas expulsion of clusters in the present - day mw need to be done to make predictions of the velocity field for gaia , because each young cluster should be surrounded by a radially expanding population of stars of similar age as the cluster population . as predicted by kroupa ( 2005 ) the expanding population forms a new moving group stemming from explosive residual gas expulsion that is related to the pre - gas expulsion velocity dispersion of stars in the embedded cluster , and thus to the mass of the re - virilised cluster .",
    "this new moving group ( mgi according to kroupa 2005 ) is present in addition to the classical moving group ( mgii according to kroupa 2005 ) stemming from secular evolution .",
    "clustered star formation may thus also affect the kinematics and structural properties of galaxies .",
    "for example kroupa ( 2002 ) has shown that the thick disk may be outcome of violent star formation within a thin disk .",
