    "let us consider the moment maps @xmath200 for @xmath3 , where the base affine manifolds are @xmath201 $ ] and @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "then the mirror landau ",
    "ginzburgs of @xmath203 and @xmath204 are respectively given by @xmath205 where @xmath206 ( remark [ horivafa ] ) .",
    "note that the boundary of the closure @xmath207 can be glued by the multiplication map @xmath208 to form an elliptic curve @xmath8 , which is identified with the mirror elliptic curve @xmath209 .",
    "we observe that this corresponds to the gluing of the boundary of the affine manifold @xmath210 $ ] by shift @xmath211 ( twisted by the b - field upstairs ) . in order to confirm the dht conjecture ,",
    "we moreover want a map @xmath212 which descends to a double covering @xmath213 that locally looks like the superpotential @xmath214 ( resp .",
    "@xmath215 ) over the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) semisphere of the base @xmath163 .",
    "unfortunately , the naive analytic continuation of @xmath216 over @xmath217 does not work .",
    "the correct answer is given by considering all the landau ",
    "ginzburg models of the above sort , namely for @xmath218 the landau  ginzburg models",
    "@xmath219 where the variable @xmath220 is defined inductively by @xmath221 .",
    "this means to eliminate the above arbitrary choice of a fundamental domain of the @xmath222-action on @xmath217 when we construct the mirror elliptic curve @xmath223 .",
    "a crucial observation is that if we consider all the even or odd superpotential @xmath67 s at once ( in the sense of remark [ product formula ] below ) , they descend to the elliptic curve @xmath223 as sections of an ample line bundle as follow .",
    "let us first consider the infinite product @xmath224 where we set @xmath225 and @xmath226 are the dedekind eta function and theta function with characteristic @xmath227 respectively .",
    "[ product formula ] we can think of @xmath228 as the product of all the landau  ginzburg superpotential @xmath67 s for odd @xmath218 because of the formula @xmath229 for all @xmath230 and @xmath231 .    in a similar manner",
    ", we next consider @xmath232 which can be thought of as the product of all the landau ",
    "ginzburg superpotential @xmath67 s for even @xmath218 .",
    "it is a classical fact that the theta functions with characteristics @xmath233 form a basis of the @xmath234-polarization of the elliptic curve @xmath235 .",
    "therefore we obtain a double covering @xmath236.\\ ] ] observing that @xmath45 locally looks like the superpotential @xmath67 on each piece @xmath13 , we confirm that it is precisely the gluing of the two landau  ginzburg model argued in the dht conjecture .",
    "this completes a proof of the conjecture in the case of elliptic curves .",
    "it is crucial in the above proof not to take the large volume limit but to keep track of the complex structures on the mirror annuli . in this way , we are able to naturally glue the landau - ginzburg models ( without the heuristic cutting process discussed in the conjecture ) .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the product expressions of the theta functions are the manifestation of quantum corrections , which are encoded in the landau ",
    "ginzburg superpotentials , in syz mirror symmetry .",
    "this gives a new insight into the classical algebraic geometry .",
    "the elliptic curves are somewhat special and our construction readily generalizes to a degeneration of an elliptic curve to a nodal union of @xmath33 rational curves forming a cycle .",
    "the superpotential of each rational curve corresponds to a theta function with an appropriate characteristic , and they span a basis of the @xmath237-polarization of the mirror elliptic curve .",
    "note that the same result is obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.4 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) from different perspectives .",
    "this is due to the accidental fact that a tyurin degeneration of an elliptic curve can be thought of as a maximal degeneration at a large complex structure limit .",
    "a main difference shows up , for example .",
    "when we consider a type ii degeneration of an abelian surface which is not maximal nor toric degeneration @xcite .",
    "however the essential mechanism of the dht conjecture is already apparent in the case of elliptic curves : gluing the base affine manifolds and constructing theta function from the landau - ginzburg superpotentials .",
    "a key idea of our proof is to glue the two different affine manifolds @xmath238 and @xmath239 along the boundaries to obtain a compact affine manifold @xmath240 .",
    "this idea is not new and a similar construction ( doubling ) was already suggested by auroux @xcite . however , it is in general very hard to glue together higher dimensional affine manifolds along the boundaries .",
    "the difficulty is closely related to a choice of an anti - canonical divisor @xmath42 of a quasi - fano manifold @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we need a special lagrangian fibration @xmath241 which is compatible with @xmath28 , and then smoothness of @xmath28 and that of the boundary @xmath242 seem proportional . on the other hand ,",
    "syz mirror symmetry for @xmath41 tends to be harder as @xmath28 gets less singular .",
    "this seems the main obstruction to generalize our discussion in higher dimensions .",
    "a notable feature of the dht conjecture is that it bridges a gap between mirror symmetry for calabi ",
    "yau manifolds and that for fano manifolds .",
    "the conjecture naturally suggests a construction of a mirror calabi ",
    "yau manifold from a more general degeneration of a calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "for instance , the recent gross  siebert program @xcite is a powerful algebro - geometric program to construct a mirror calabi ",
    "yau manifold from a given toric degeneration of a calabi  yau manifold , which serves as a maximal degeneration of a calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "however , it is not clear at all how we should make use of the mirror of a more general degeneration limit of a calabi  yau manifold .",
    "a naive expectation is that a mirror calabi ",
    "yau manifold should come with a map , which could be obtained by _ gluing _ the mirror landau",
    " ginzburg models of the irreducible components of the degeneration limit . moreover , the glueability condition should be mirror to a kawamata  namikawa type log smoothablitiy condition . in general the above map , which is obtained by _ aligning _ the superpotentials ,",
    "does not provide a polarization with the mirror manifold ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) ) .",
    "for example it is the case if the number of the irreducible components is less than the dimension of the calabi ",
    "yau manifold plus 1 .",
    "lastly , the dht conjecture and the above speculation can be investigated from many different perspectives and it would be of interest to ask , for example , what they mean in the lagrangian floer theory and theoretical physics .",
