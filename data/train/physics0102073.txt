    "in the world , almost everyone knows that coulomb s force ( or gravitational force ) acts along the line joining a couple of particles , but sometime this knowledge is incorrect in the theory of relativity .",
    "consider a particle moving at the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 in an inertial cartesian coordinate system @xmath1 , the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 is given by@xcite @xmath2 the above equation is valid so that any force can never change @xmath0 in its magnitude but can change @xmath0 in its direction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the coulomb s force or gravitational force on a particle always acts in the direction orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle in the 4-dimensional space - time , rather than along the line joining the particle and action source .",
    "strictly , any 4-vector force @xmath3 satisfies the following orthogonality .",
    "@xmath4 where the cartesian coordinate system @xmath5 is a frame of reference whose axes are orthogonal to one another , there is no distinction between covariant and contravariant components , only subscripts need to be used .",
    "although the orthogonality has occasionally appeared in some textbooksrindler , in the present paper , eq.([2 ] ) has been elevated to an essential requirement for the definition of a force , which brings out many new aspects for the coulomb s force and gravitational force .",
    "suppose there are two charged particle @xmath6 and @xmath7 locating at the positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively in the cartesian coordinate system @xmath5 , and moving at the 4-vector velocities @xmath0 and @xmath10 respectively , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , where we have used @xmath11 to denote @xmath12 .",
    "the coulomb s force @xmath3 acting on the particle @xmath6 is orthogonal to the velocity direction of @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] using the euclidian geometry to represent the complex space - time . like a centripetal force ,",
    "the force @xmath3 should make an attempt to rotate itself about the particle path center .",
    "we think that the path center , @xmath6 , @xmath13 and the force @xmath3 all should be in the plane of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that we make an expansion to @xmath3 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are unknown coefficients , the possibility of this expansion will be further clear in the next section in where the expansion is not an assumption [ see eq.([25 ] ) ] .",
    "is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 of @xmath6 , and lies in the plane of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a retardation with respect to @xmath7 , here the euclidian geometry is used to illustrate the complex space - time . ]    using the orthogonality @xmath17 , we get @xmath18 by eliminating the coefficient @xmath16 , we rewrite eq.([3 ] ) as @xmath19   \\label{5}\\ ] ] it follows from the direction of eq.([5 ] ) that the unit vector @xmath20 of the coulomb s force direction is given by @xmath21 \\label{6}\\ ] ] because of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that the magnitude of the force @xmath3 has the classical form @xmath25 combination of eq.([6 ] ) with eq.([9 ] ) , we obtain a modified coulomb s force @xmath26   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{kqq^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r^{3}}[(u\\cdot r)u^{\\prime } -(u\\cdot u^{\\prime } ) r ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & q[(u\\cdot ( \\frac{kq^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r^{3}}r))u^{\\prime } -(u\\cdot u^{\\prime } ) ( \\frac{kq^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r^{3}}r ) ]   \\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the relation @xmath27 we obtain @xmath28   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & q[-(u_{\\nu } \\partial _ { \\nu } ( \\frac{kq^{\\prime } u_{\\mu } ^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r } ) ) + ( u_{\\nu } ) \\partial _ { \\mu } ( \\frac{kq^{\\prime } u_{\\nu } ^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r } ) ] \\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the force can be rewritten in terms of 4-vector components as @xmath29 thus @xmath30 expresses the 4-vector potential of the particle @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to find that eq.([13 ] ) contains the lorentz force .      from eq.([15 ] ) , because of @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 it is known as the lorentz gauge condition .    to note that @xmath35 has three degrees of freedom under the condition of @xmath36 , so we have @xmath37 from eq.([14 ] ) , we have @xmath38 where we define @xmath39 as the current density of the source . from eq.([14 ] ) , by exchanging the indices and taking the summation of them , we have @xmath40 the eq.([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) are known as the maxwell s equations .",
    "for continuous media , they are valid as well as .      from the maxwell s equations ,",
    "we know there is a retardation time for the electromagnetic action to propagate between the two particles , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] , the retardation effect is measured by the distance from point p to the point c. @xmath41 then @xmath42 obviously , eq.([22 ] ) is known as the lienard - wiechert potential for a moving particle .",
    "the above formalism clearly shows that the maxwell s equations can be derived from the classical coulomb s force and the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity . in other words ,",
    "the orthogonality is hidden in the maxwell s equation .",
    "specially , eq.([5 ] ) directly accounts for the geometrical meanings of the curl of vector potential , the curl contains the orthogonality .",
    "the orthogonality of force and velocity is one of consequences from the relativistic mechanics .",
    "the above formalism has a significance on guiding how to develop the theory of gravity . in analogy with the modified coulomb s force of eq.([10 ] ) , we directly suggest a modified universal gravitational force as @xmath43   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{gmm^{\\prime } } { c^{2}r^{3}}[(u\\cdot r)u^{\\prime } -(u\\cdot u^{\\prime } ) r ]   \\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a couple of particles with masses @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , the gravitational force must satisfy the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity .    even though the gravitation is treated as a field in the theory of general relativity",
    ", here we emphasize that gravitational force must hold the orthogonality if it can be defined as a force .",
    "it follows from eq.([23 ] ) that we can predict that there exist the gravitational radiation and magnetism - like components for a gravitational force .",
    "particularly , the magnetism - like components would play an important role in geophysics and atmosphere physics .",
    "if we have not any knowledge but know there exists the classical universal gravitation @xmath46 between two particles @xmath44 and @xmath45 , what form will take the 4-vector gravitational force @xmath3 ?",
    "suppose that @xmath47 is at rest at the origin , using @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we have @xmath51   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{|\\mathbf{f}|}{|\\mathbf{r}|}\\frac{1}{(u^{\\prime } \\cdot u)}% [ ( u^{\\prime } \\cdot u)(\\mathbf{r},0)-(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{r})u^{\\prime } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{|\\mathbf{f}|}{|\\mathbf{r}|(u^{\\prime } \\cdot u)}[(u^{\\prime } \\cdot u)r-(u\\cdot r)u^{\\prime } ]   \\label{25}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath24 , @xmath52 .",
    "if we rotate  ( the lorentz transformations ) our frame of reference in the 4-dimensional space - time to make @xmath45 not to be at rest , eq.([25 ] ) will still valid because of its covariance .",
    "then we find the 4-vector gravitational force goes back to the form of eq.([23 ] ) , like lorentz force , having magnetism - like components .",
    "consider a planet @xmath44 moving about the sun @xmath53 with the 4-vector velocity @xmath54 , @xmath55 in the polar coordinate system @xmath56 .",
    "we assume the sun is at rest at the origin , @xmath57 , then from eq.([23 ] ) , the motion of the planet is governed by @xmath58from the above equations we obtain their solutions @xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two integral constants , @xmath62 is called the schwarzschild s radius , @xmath63 is a small term .",
    "eq.([32 ] ) agrees with the relation @xmath64 .",
    "consider the turning point at where the planet is at rest , @xmath65 , the radius of the turning point is @xmath66 , then    @xmath67    eq.([31 ] ) tells us the relation between the time interval @xmath68 and the proper time interval @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70hence , we know that the proper time interval @xmath69 at position @xmath71 and the proper time interval @xmath72 at @xmath73 have the relation@xmath74since @xmath63 ( or @xmath75 ) is a very small quantity , we neglect all but the first - order terms .    in the following subsections , we show that eq.([31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) can give out the same results as the theory of general relativity for gravitational problems@xcite .      according to eq.([35 ] ) , the period of oscillation of an atom at @xmath71 is related to the period of oscillation of an atom at @xmath73 by @xmath76this effect is called the gravitational red shift@xcite .      consider the planet again , substituting eq.([35 ] ) into eq.([32 ] ) and eq.([33 ] ) , we obtain @xmath77^{2}+[(1+\\frac{s}{2r})% \\frac{dx_{\\varphi } } { d\\tau _ { \\infty } } ] ^{2}+[ic(\\varepsilon + \\frac{s}{2r}% ) ] ^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "r(1+\\frac{s}{2r})\\frac{dx_{\\varphi } } { d\\tau _ { \\infty } } = h \\label{40}\\end{aligned}\\]]in order to pursue the covariance of eq.([40 ] ) , we define the angular displacement @xmath79d\\varphi $ ] , then we have @xmath80eliminating @xmath72 by dividing eq.([41 ] ) by eq.([42 ] ) , we obtain @xmath81now making the change of variable @xmath82 gives @xmath83differentiating with respect to @xmath84 gives @xmath85the last term on the left side of the equation is relativistic correction , in the absence of this term , the solution is @xmath86   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & u_{0}[1+e\\cos ( \\varphi _ { \\infty } -\\varphi _ { 0 } ) ]   \\label{47}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the constants of integration .",
    "writing @xmath89 , we find that eq.([45 ] ) becomes @xmath90by inspection we see that @xmath91 is on oscillatory function of @xmath92 with the frequency @xmath93from @xmath94 for a cycle , we know that @xmath95thus the perihelion advance of the planet is given by @xmath96this result is the same as that in the theory of general relativity .",
    "since the above solutions are independent from the planet mass @xmath44 , if the planet is a photon without mass , it also satisfies the above motion like a planet . for a photon , @xmath97 , eq.([33 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath98then eq.([45 ] ) becomes @xmath99the solution of this equation gives out the path of the photon , it is the same as that of the theory of general relativity .",
    "so in its flight past the massive object @xmath53 of radius @xmath35 the photon is deflected through an angle    @xmath100    in agreement with experimental observations .      if there is not the nonlinear effect of photon flying , any straight line in the space - time is of the path of photon . since the light is bent in the 4-dimensional space - time for an infinite distance observer ,",
    "we consequently conclude that the space will bend due to the gravitational effect mentioned above near a massive object .      in classical mechanics",
    ", we have the impression that force yields acceleration , here we make an attempt to express that force yields the rotation of 4-vector velocity in the 4-dimensional space time .",

    "since the particle is accelerated by @xmath109 , then the rotation is given by @xmath110because the origins of @xmath5 and @xmath105 coincide at the time @xmath111 , the coordinate transformations between them are @xmath112it is known as the lorentz transformations .",
    "to note that the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity is valid for any force : strong , electromagnetic , weak and gravitational interactions , therefore many new aspects of force concept in mechanics remain for physics to explore .",
