    "the famous experiment of messages being forwarded to a target among a group of people , carried out by milgram @xcite in the 1960s , and also by dodds _",
    "et al . _ in 2003 @xcite on a larger scale , reveals the existence of short paths between pairs of distant vertices in networks that appear to be regular ( i.e. the small - world effect @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important quantities that characterize this small - world effect is the average shortest path length @xmath11 between two vertices . on small world networks",
    ", this value grows very slowly ( relative to the case of a fully regular network ) with the network size @xmath12 .",
    "recent empirical research has shown that a great variety of natural and artificial networks with their structure dominated by regularity are actually small worlds , and their average path lengths grow as @xmath13@xcite , or more slowly .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more reviews . )",
    "an alternative issue revealed by experiments , but less obvious , is about the realistic process of passing information on small world networks .",
    "this kind of information navigation has been studied by kleinberg@xcite .",
    "this process goes dynamically : when a message is to be sent to a designated target , each individual forwards the message to one of its nearest neighbors ( connected either by a regular link or a shortcut ) based on its limited information . without information of the whole network structure ,",
    "this actual path is usually longer than the shortest one given by the topological structure .",
    "while @xmath14 is the average shortest path length , the average actual path length @xmath15 is the average number of steps required to pass messages between randomly chosen vertex pairs . as @xmath16",
    "is usually referred to as the diameter of the system , in the rest of this paper @xmath17 shall be taken as the effective diameter , and @xmath18 .",
    "it has been noted that the topology of the network may significantly affect the behavior of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in other words , it may determine the efficiency of passing information .",
    "based on milgram s experiment , kleinberg studied navigation process on a variant of the watts - strogatz ( w - s ) small - world model @xcite on an @xmath20 open regular square lattice .",
    "each vertex sends out a long range link with probability @xmath0 , and the probability of the other end falling on a vertex at euclidean distance @xmath21 away decays as @xmath22 .",
    "kleinberg studied @xmath17 when each vertex sends out one long range link , and proved a lower bound of @xmath23 . when @xmath24 , the long range links are uniform , and @xmath25 was obtained . de moura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied @xmath26 on the @xmath27-dimensional w - s model with @xmath24 and varying @xmath0 , and obtained @xmath28 , and thus @xmath29 in the two - dimensional case . in the more recent work of zhu _",
    "@xcite on the one - dimensional case , the variance of @xmath30 with both @xmath31 and @xmath0 was studied , and scaling relations were shown to exist . for the studies of the searching processes on other different networks , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically investigate the navigation process on a two - dimensional variant of the w - s network model @xcite .",
    "we study the behavior of @xmath17 by first working out the scaling relations in the two - dimensional case .",
    "our result also provides new understanding of the scaling analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] , the model used here is constructed and the navigation process is described , and then the average actual path length @xmath19 is obtained with some approximation based on a rigorous treatment . following that , in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] , the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath32 and @xmath0 are presented based on scaling relations . special attention is paid to the cases studied in the works of kleinberg @xcite and de moura @xcite .",
    "summary and discussions can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] .",
    "our model starts from a @xmath33 two - dimensional square lattice . with periodic boundary condition",
    ", the lattice distance between two vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written in a two - dimensional fashion as @xmath36 this value is actually the length of the shortest path connecting these two vertices through only regular links . to generate a small world , with probability @xmath0 ( @xmath37 )",
    "each vertex sends out an additional link to another vertex ( excluding its original nearest neighbors ) .",
    "if this other vertex is selected at random , then we are creating a small - world network with random shortcuts .",
    "based on realistic considerations ( for example , people tend to be brought together by similar interest , occupation , etc . ) , we shall add the shortcuts in a biased manner @xcite : if the shortcut starts from vertex @xmath38 , the probability that vertex @xmath39 is selected as the end depends on the lattice distance between them in the following way , @xmath40 where @xmath31 is a positive exponent and @xmath41 is the normalization factor .    in the model described above , the navigation process can be simulated with the so - called `` greedy ''  algorithm @xcite : without loss of generality , suppose the target is vertex @xmath42 .",
    "at each step , the current message holder , vertex @xmath43 , passes the message through one of its regular or long - range links .",
    "based on its limited local information , this link is believed to bring the message the closest to the target . based on this algorithm , the actual path length @xmath44 can be obtained after taking an ensemble average over all possible realizations of the network ( with a set of fixed parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath12 , @xmath45 , etc . ) .    in the simplest case",
    ", we suppose that each vertex has information of only the vertices that can be reached within one step , and do the calculation as the following : ( 1 ) if the current message holder is vertex @xmath46 , we simply have @xmath47 it is the same for the other nearest neighbors of the target @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "( 2 ) there are @xmath51 nodes with lattice distance @xmath52 from the target : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "if the current message holder is , for example , @xmath57 , then with probability @xmath58 it is directly linked to the target via one shortcut , which means the message is sent directly to the target with this probability . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability that the message is forwarded along a regular bond is @xmath59 thus @xmath60 the calculation is the same for the other @xmath61 nodes mentioned above .",
    "( 3 ) in a general case , the message is held by vertex @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 denotes the probability that the message is forwarded in the next step to a vertex @xmath64 , which must be nearer to the target than @xmath65 by at least lattice distance @xmath52 .",
    "if the message holder is not able to find a shortcut , the message will be forwarded along a regular link with probability @xmath66 for example , if the vertex @xmath67 passes the message through a regular link , it will randomly choose @xmath68 or @xmath69 , which in the following will be denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "now , with this set of probabilities @xmath71 , we obtain , @xmath72 + w_{reg}\\left [ 1+\\left\\langle l\\left ( x_{reg},y_{reg}\\right ) \\right\\rangle \\right ] .",
    "\\label{dituin}\\ ] ] considering that @xmath73 is a relatively small quantity , @xmath63 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath74 where we have used the fact that @xmath75",
    ". then it is an easy task to obtain @xmath76 from eq .",
    "( [ wreg ] ) .",
    "recall that we have the definition of the average shortest path length @xmath77 , where @xmath78is the length of the shortest path between vertices @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "by contrast , the average actual path length can be defined as @xmath81 further , with vertex @xmath82 being the target , we group the other nodes according to their lattice distance from the target , and in the following we shall also discuss the function @xmath83 , which for each value of @xmath84 is obtained by averaging all nodes @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the average actual path length depends on multiple parameters . here",
    "we take into consideration varying @xmath12 , @xmath31 , and @xmath0 , but keep the range of view of each vertex limited to its nearest neighbors .",
    "our discussion of the navigation process starts from looking for the basic scaling relations .",
    "scaling relation is not new in the theories of small world effect .",
    "actually , it plays a central role in the current theoretical framework . in 1999 , newman @xcite showed that in the w - s model with uniform shortcuts the average shortest path length is a function of @xmath87 , and it sharply decreases when @xmath87 becomes larger than 1 .",
    "newman noticed that @xmath87 is simply the expected number @xmath88 of long - range links .",
    "the threshold of small world behavior is @xmath89 , that means the network becomes a small world when there is more than one long - range link . when the model network is generalized , this interpretation shall be generalized as well .",
    "for example , in a discussion of the scaling relations in the problem of dynamic navigation , zhu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered inhomogeneous long range links ( the probability of linking two nodes falls when their lattice distance increases ) . in their study , the dynamic small world behavior is switched on when @xmath90 , where @xmath88 is the number of long - range links and @xmath91 is the average reduced link length ( the average length of long range links @xmath6 divided by the system size ) .",
    "although they focused on different aspects ( static and dynamic ) of the small world effect , we can still compare these two versions of scaling relations . because in the model studied by newman , @xmath92 , it is consistent with the interpretation of zhu _",
    "et al_. actually , as we shall see below , the interpretation of zhu _ et al .",
    "_ can be developed as well , when a more general model is considered .    in the introduction",
    "we have defined @xmath17 as the effective diameter , in the following we will use @xmath93 as the reduced effective diameter . if the network is regular , @xmath94 will appear as a constant .",
    "bearing this in mind , we first look at the results shown in fig.1 . for each value of @xmath31",
    "( with exception at @xmath8 , as will be shown below ) , @xmath94 appears as a function of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the average length of long - range links .",
    "thus our study clearly supports an interpretation different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite : instead of @xmath95 , the parameter should be @xmath5 . in the one - dimensional case , this equals @xmath95 , and thus consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite . when @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , indicating that the network is virtually regular , and when @xmath99 increases beyond @xmath100 , the system begins to show a dynamic small world behavior .    however , we find interesting exceptions at @xmath8 and @xmath101 .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , at @xmath8 , @xmath102 is a linear function of @xmath103 for @xmath5 significantly larger than @xmath100 . due to this extra factor of @xmath104",
    ", there is no way that @xmath105 can be written as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath106 because at @xmath8 the system shows the shortest @xmath15 , this is certainly a case of special interest .",
    "it becomes more curious when we notice that in one dimension there is not such an exception in the scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.3 , at @xmath107 , @xmath94 appears as a function of @xmath108 , and the dynamic small world behavior is seen when this parameter exceeds @xmath100 .",
    "there is more discussion of these interesting points later .",
    "figs.1 , 2 and 3 can give us more information once we get an idea of @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath12 large enough , we can use the following approximation ,    @xmath109    which gives @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 some comments on this approximation : we have chosen the upper and lower limits for the integrals with some arbitrariness . for @xmath115 and for @xmath12 very large , it gives results good enough for the later discussion .",
    "surely this approximation fails for @xmath10 , but in that region what is important is @xmath6 stays finite as @xmath12 goes to infinity .    from eqs .",
    "( [ ravel ] ) to ( [ ravel3 ] ) , we have for large enough @xmath12    @xmath116    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122    in the above equations , @xmath123 come out as special points .",
    "@xmath124 , corresponds to the totally random network .",
    "below @xmath125 , @xmath126 is always proportional to @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed that for @xmath127 the system is in the random network phase , and @xmath128 is the continuous phase transition point from the random network phase to the small - world phase .",
    "as @xmath31 increases above @xmath129 , @xmath6 is finite and independent of @xmath12 in the limit of @xmath130 . as a result ,",
    "the system is virtually a regular network for @xmath131 .",
    "now we have the scaling relations shown in figs.1 , 2 and 3 , and @xmath6 as a function of @xmath12 given by eqs .",

    "the limited knowledge of the nodes of a network is an important limitation that has to be considered when studying navigation processes .",
    "another interesting and important limitation is due to the fact that the links in a network are usually associated with `` weights '' , as systematically studied in refs .",
    "further studies on link - weighted small - world model should help us gain insight in the navigation and other relevant phenomena in various artificial and natural networks , and help us design networks with higher efficiency .",
