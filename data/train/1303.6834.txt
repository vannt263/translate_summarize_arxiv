    "the existence of global strong solutions for system  has been proven in @xcite in dimension 2 , and more recently in dimension 3 for small data in a framework where the deformations of the solid are limited in regularity .",
    "the main result of this second part is theorem [ maintheorem ] , that we can state as follows :    let be @xmath0 . then for @xmath1 small enough in @xmath2",
    ", there exists a deformation @xmath3 satisfying the hypotheses * h1**h4 * given above and also @xmath4 such that the solution @xmath5 of system  satisfies @xmath6    the notation are explained in section [ secdef ] , below .",
    "the proof of this theorem is based on the preliminary stabilization of the linearized system in part i. the idea is the following : if the perturbations of the system ( which are represented by the initial conditions ) are small enough , the behavior of the nonlinear system is close to the evolution of the linearized system .",
    "the strategy we follow in this second part consists in rewriting system  in cylindrical domains ( that means in domains whose the space component does not depend on time ) , by defining a change of variables and a change of unknowns .",
    "then we focus on the nonlinear system thus obtained . the feedback boundary control obtained in part i enables us to stabilize the nonhomogeneous linear part of this system , whereas we have now to consider as a control function a deformation of the solid which satisfies the nonlinear constraints * h1**h4 * given above .",
    "so the difficulty is to define properly from this boundary feedback control a deformation of the solid which stabilizes the full nonlinear system .",
    "for that the boundary feedback control is extended inside the solid as it is done in the section 6 of part i ; the deformation thus obtained satisfies the linearized version of the constraints stated in the hypotheses * h1**h4*. then we project the displacement associated with this mapping on a set representing the displacements satisfying the nonlinear constraints .",
    "the deformation obtained is said to be _",
    "admissible _ , that is to say it lies in a well - chosen functional space and it obeys the hypotheses * h1**h4 * ( see definition [ defcontrol ] ) .",
    "this projection method enables us to decompose the deformation velocity - on the fluid - solid interface - into two parts : the first part of this decomposition stabilizes the linear part of the nonlinear system , whereas the remaining part satisfies good lipschitz properties with respect to the boundary feedback control .",
    "this point is essential if we want to prove by a fixed point method that such a deformation stabilizes the nonlinear system .",
    "+ besides the technical aspects of this work , a particular difficulty is the consideration of a control that has to satisfy nonlinear physical constraints . the originality of our contribution can be read in a perspective which concerns the study and the control of the swim of a deformable structure at an intermediate reynolds number . by controlling the velocity of the environing fluid in a bounded domain ,",
    "the solid stabilizes to zero the full system which is already dissipative ( because of the viscosity ) , but the strength lies in the fact that this stabilization is obtained for all prescribed exponential decay rate .",
    "+ other papers treat of this issue : let us quote for instance the work of khapalov @xcite where the incompressible navier - stokes equations are considered .",
    "more recently let us mention the work of chambrion & munnier @xcite dealing with perfect fluids , and where geometric methods have been used .",
    "concerning the swim at a low reynolds number , let us quote the recent paper @xcite where prescribed types of deformations are considered .",
    "at a high reynolds number , the work of glass & rosier @xcite consists in applying the coron return method in order to prove the local controllability of the position and the velocity of a boat , which is able to impose a velocity on a part of its boundary in order to move itself in a fluid satisfying the incompressible euler equations .",
    "the result we give concerns only the velocities of the system .",
    "the functional framework is given in section [ secdef ] for the unknowns as well as for the control function and the changes of variables .",
    "then the change of variables and the change of unknowns are introduced in section [ secchange ] .",
    "technical results in relation with the changes of variables are stated and proven in appendix  a and appendix  b. in section [ secchange ] we also give the nonlinear system written in cylindrical domains , in a form which enables us to make the connection with the linearized system .",
    "the main result of part i is used in section [ linearsec ] where the feedback stabilization of the nonhomogeneous linear system is treated",
    ". then we construct in section [ secdecompcontrol ] an _ admissible _ deformation which is supposed to stabilize the full nonlinear system in section [ secnonlinear ] . the link with the actual unknowns",
    "is made in section [ secconclusion ] as a conclusion .",
    "the cofactor matrix associated with some matrix field @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "let us keep in mind that when this matrix is invertible we have the property @xmath9 let us introduce some functional spaces .",

    "indeed , in this work the data are assumed to be small enough , so that we will lead to consider the displacement @xmath59 small enough in the space @xmath39 and so in @xmath60 ; thus we can assume that this constraint is always satisfied .",

    "the aim of this subsection is to construct a mapping @xmath69 which has to satisfy the properties @xmath73 such that for all @xmath56 the function @xmath74 maps @xmath28 onto @xmath75 , @xmath76 onto @xmath77 , and leaves invariant the boundary @xmath78 . for that ,",
    "let us first define an intermediate extension .",

    "the change of variables we use in this paper has the same properties as the ones constructed in these articles .",
    "but the way we proceed here is not the same : in @xcite the mapping @xmath69 is constructed by extending the eulerian velocity @xmath93 to the fluid part , but this means is not suitable in a framework where the role of the lagrangian mapping representing the deformation of the solid is central and where its regularity is limited ; indeed the velocity @xmath94 is defined through @xmath95 which is itself defined on the domain @xmath96 . concerning the means used in @xcite , the problem solved for constructing",
    "the mapping @xmath69 in this paper is similar to ours , but it requires a smallness assumption on the time existence . here",
