    "we consider simple undirected graphs , and are interested in the classical packings of graphs as introduced in @xcite , and their generalization , called limited packings , as presented in @xcite . in the literature , the classical packings can be referred to under different names , e.g. , as ( distance ) @xmath9-packings @xcite , closed neighborhood packings @xcite , or strong stable sets @xcite .",
    "they can also be considered as generalizations of independent ( stable ) sets , which would be ( distance ) @xmath10-packings , following the terminology of @xcite .",

    "@xmath2-limited packing number _ @xmath7 of a graph @xmath1 is the maximum size of a @xmath2-limited packing in @xmath1 . in these terms , the classical ( distance ) @xmath9-packings are @xmath10-limited packings , and hence @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the 2-packing number .",
    "@xmath9-packings ( @xmath10-limited packings ) are well - studied in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , several papers discuss connections between packings and dominating sets in graphs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the corresponding problems have a very different nature : one of the problems ( packings ) is a maximization problem not to break some ( security ) constraints , and the other is a minimization problem ( dominating sets ) to satisfy some reliability requirements .",
    "for example , given a graph @xmath1 , the definitions imply a simple inequality @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the domination number of @xmath1 ( e.g. , see @xcite )",
    ". however , the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath14 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "in general , the problems of packings in graphs can be viewed as facility location problems subject to some ( security ) constraints .",
    "the problem of finding a @xmath9-packing ( @xmath10-limited packing ) of maximum size is shown to be @xmath8-complete in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the problem of finding a maximum size @xmath2-limited packing is @xmath8-complete even in split or bipartite graphs .",
    "we develop the probabilistic method for @xmath2-limited packings and , in particular , for @xmath9-packings ( @xmath10-limited packings ) , with a comparison to a greedy approach .",
    "we present two new lower bounds for the @xmath2-limited packing number @xmath7 , and a randomized algorithm to find @xmath2-limited packings satisfying the lower bounds .",
    "also , using a greedy algorithm approach , we provide an improved lower bound for @xmath11 .",
    "it can be shown that the main lower bound is asymptotically sharp , and the improvements for @xmath10-limited packings from the greedy algorithm approach are asymptotically irrelevant for almost all graphs .",
    "we also provide some new upper bounds for @xmath7 .",
    "details for some of these results can be found in @xcite .",

    "the following theorem gives a new lower bound for the @xmath2-limited packing number .",
    "[ th1 ] for any graph @xmath1 of order @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23    the probabilistic construction used to prove theorem [ th1 ] implies a randomized algorithm to find a @xmath2-limited packing set , whose size satisfies bound ( [ main_bound ] ) with a positive probability .",
    "a pseudocode presented in algorithm [ alg : k - limited ] below explicitly describes the randomized algorithm .",
    "algorithm [ alg : k - limited ] can be implemented to run in @xmath24 time .",
    "also , it can be implemented in parallel or as a local distributed algorithm , which is important in some applications .",
    "[ alg : k - limited ]    the lower bound of theorem [ th1 ] can be written in a simple weaker form as follows :    for any graph @xmath1 of order @xmath21 , @xmath25    in the case @xmath26 , theorem [ th1 ] gives the following lower bound :    [ cor22 ] for any graph @xmath1 of order @xmath21 with @xmath27 , @xmath28    let @xmath29 = @xmath30 denote the minimum vertex degree of @xmath1 .",
    "the lower bound ( [ bcor22 ] ) can be improved as follows :    [ th22 ] for any graph @xmath1 of order @xmath21 , @xmath31    the proof of theorem [ th22 ] provides a greedy algorithm to find a distance @xmath9-packing ( @xmath10-limited packing ) satisfying bound ( [ greedy_bound ] ) .",
    "however , as explained later , the lower bound of theorem [ th22 ] is as good as lower bound ( [ bcor22 ] ) of corollary [ cor22 ] for almost all graphs .",
    "refining and developing the ideas and techniques used in the proofs of the above results , we have been able to show the following more subtle results .",

    "the lower bound of theorem [ th1 ] is asymptotically best possible for some ` large ' values of @xmath2 . bound ( [ main_bound ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath37{{\\delta \\choose k } ( \\delta + 1 ) } } $ ] for @xmath38 . combining this with the upper bound of lemma @xmath39 from @xcite , for any connected graph @xmath1 with @xmath40",

    "therefore , theorem [ th1 ] is asymptotically sharp for regular connected graphs in the case @xmath44 .",
    "a similar statement can be proved when @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the following result is true :      as stated in theorem [ th22 ] , in contrast to the situation for relatively ` large ' values of @xmath2 , bound ( [ main_bound ] ) of theorem [ th1 ] ( corollary [ cor22 ] ) can be improved for distance @xmath9-packings ( @xmath10-limited packings ) , i.e. when @xmath26 . however , this improvement is irrelevant for almost all graphs .",
    "a @xmath10-limited packing set @xmath0 in @xmath1 has a very strong property that any two vertices of @xmath0 are at distance at least @xmath48 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that almost every graph has diameter equal to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 for almost all graphs .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath26 , theorem [ th1 ] yields a lower bound of 1 for almost all graphs and is as good as theorem [ th22 ] .",
    "notice that the bound of theorem [ th22 ] is sharp , for example for any number of disjoint copies of the petersen graph .",
    "when @xmath1 has a diameter larger than @xmath9 , it should be better to use the greedy algorithm and lower bound ( [ greedy_bound ] ) provided by theorem [ th22 ] : it improves bound ( [ bcor22 ] ) of corollary [ cor22 ] by a factor of @xmath50 .    as mentioned earlier , @xmath51 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide several upper bounds for @xmath7 , e.g. , given any graph @xmath1 , @xmath52 .",
