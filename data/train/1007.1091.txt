    "optical spectroscopy of hd  74194 , performed just a few days after the source discovery , showed variability in the h@xmath6 profile and a radial velocity variation with an amplitude of about 35 kms@xmath1 ( hei and heii absorption lines ; @xcite ) .",
    "other bright x  ray flares were observed with  and   in october 2006 , july 2008 and september 2008 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an orbital period of @xmath735 days has been suggested based on the duration of the flaring activity @xcite , although a secure determination based on x  ray and/or optical modulation is still lacking . also a pulse period has never been found ,",
    "thus the nature of the compact object is unknown .",

    "ray binaries ( hmxbs ) called supergiant fast x",

    "the large majority of the members of this class have been discovered by  during the survey of the galactic plane ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a few sfxts are x  ray pulsars , thus demonstrating that the compact object is a neutron star , while in the other sources a black hole can not be excluded , although the broad band spectra ( 0.1 - 100 kev ) in outburst are very similar to those typically observed in accreting pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) . their outbursts typically show a duration of a few days ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with small duty cycles although highly variable from source to source @xcite .",
    "each outburst is characterized by several short ( a few minutes to a few hour duration ) and bright flares , each reaching a luminosity of a few 10@xmath810@xmath9  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a much lower intensity emission characterizes the long term behaviour of these transients ( 10@xmath010@xmath10  erg  s@xmath1 , @xcite ) , while the quiescent state ( no accretion ) has been observed rarely and displays a very soft ( likely thermal ) spectrum with a luminosity of @xmath710@xmath3  erg  s@xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a very low level of accretion ( @xmath710@xmath3  erg  s@xmath1 ) has been observed from   in 2007 with  as well , displaying a double component spectrum composed of a thermal soft part ( likely from the supergiant companion ) , together with a harder power - law component ( @xcite ) .",
    "although sfxts only sporadically undergo a bright outburst ( from null to 4 outbursts per source have been observed during the two years long monitoring of four sfxts with ,  @xcite ) , their properties during outbursts are much better studied than their behaviour during the long - term lower intensity states ( intermediate level or the quiescence ) .",
    "we report here on a  observation of  with a net exposure of 67.4  ks ( xis ) , spanning about three days .",
    "this is the longest x  ray observation of a sfxt catching the source in a very low intensity level .",
    "we also report on the analysis of our private  observations of the source field covering about one month including times of the  observation .",
    "we then compare our  results with a much shorter observation of a low intensity state from performed with  in 2007 . to this aim ,",
    "we re - analysed these  observations , although already reported by @xcite .",
    "a  @xcite observation of  was performed from 2009 december 11 , starting at 17:53 ut , until december 14 12:00 ut .",
    "the target was placed at the ` hxd nominal ' position . the x  ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite )",
    "was operated in the normal mode with no window option , providing a time resolution of 8  s. the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) was in standard mode , with a time resolution of 61 @xmath11s for the individual events .",
    "the xis and hxd data were both processed with the _ suzaku _ pipeline version 2.4.12.27 in the heasoft ( version 6.6 ) software package .",
    "the data were screened according to standard criteria .",
    "in particular , events were discarded if they were acquired during passages through the south atlantic anomaly or in regions of low geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( @xmath126 gv for xis and @xmath128 gv for hxd ) , or with low earth elevation angles ; for the xis only events with grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were considered , and the cleansis script was used to remove hot or flickering pixels .",
    "the net exposures obtained with the xis and hxd ( live time 93.2% ) were 67.4 ks and 64.7 ks , respectively .",
    "the xis events of  were accumulated in each of the three xis cameras within a circular region ( 2@xmath13 radius ) centered on the target , while the backgrounds were estimated from source - free regions well outside the point - spread function of the source ( see fig .",
    "[ igr08408:fig : image ] ) . for the spectral analysis , spectral redistribution matrices and ancillary response files for the xis spectra",
    "were generated using the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tasks .",
    "background subtraction for the hxd data is performed using a synthetic model that accounts for the time - variable particle background ( the so - called ` non x - ray background ' , nxb ) . in particular",
    ", we used the ` tuned ' nxb model ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the cosmic x  ray background and possible galactic diffuse emission remain in the background subtracted data , as well as emission from any x - ray source that occurs in the instrument @xmath14 arcmin@xmath15 field of view .    after subtracting the nxb ,",
    "a positive signal is detected in the hxd - pin up to @xmath740 kev ( about 10% of the total counts in the 1540 kev band ) ; no significant emission is detected in the gso data . to account for the expected contribution from the ` cosmic x ",
    "ray background ' ( cxb ) , we used the spectra reported in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the cxb contributes to the observed signal with roughly half of the nxb - subtracted counts .",
    "the spectrum of the remaining signal is adequately described ( @xmath16 for 64 degrees of freedom ) by a power - law model with photon index @xmath17 ( 1@xmath18 confidence level ) and 1540 kev flux of @xmath19@xmath20 erg @xmath21 s@xmath1 .",
    "considered that the combined uncertainties on the cxb and nxb are comparable to the flux estimated in this way , and lacking any specific signature of   ( such as it would be a periodic signal ) in the hxd - pin band , we regard the observed flux only as an upper limit on the hard x  ray emission of the source . this upper limit is not very constraining for the extrapolation of the xis spectrum at high energy .",

    "[ igr08408:fig : x1lc ] .",
    "the hardness ratio does not show strong evidence of variability , thus we will study both the average spectrum extracted from the whole exposure time , as well as time selected spectra from the initial part of the observation and from the peak of the two flares , separately .",
    "fitting the whole hardness ratio as a function of time ( with a bin time of 5  ks ) to a constant model we obtain a value of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 for 44 d.o.f . ) .",
    "a timing analysis was performed after having converted the event arrival times to the solar system barycentric frame .",
    "we searched for coherent periodicity , but found no evidence for pulsations .",
    "we could place an upper limit on the pulsed fraction ( defined as the semi - amplitude of the sinusoidal modulation devided the mean count rate ) , computed according to @xcite , of 40% at the 99% confidence level for periods in the range 16s500s .",
    "cccc +    we selected three spectra from the  data - set , as follows : the first spectrum ( which we call `` persistent '' spectrum in table  [ igr08408:tab : spec ] ) was extracted accumulating all photons coming from the first 120  ks of the observation , with the lowest intensity level ( see the light curve reported in fig .  [",
    "igr08408:fig : x1lc ] ) ; the second spectrum is from the peak of the first flare ( `` flare 1 '' , between 145  ks and 160  ks in fig .",
    "[ igr08408:fig : x1lc ] ) , while the third spectrum comes from the peak of the second flare ( `` flare 2 '' , between 202  ks and 216  ks in fig .  [ igr08408:fig : x1lc ] ) .",
    "these time spans are subjective choices in order to extract the lowest intensity spectrum and the spectra at the peak of each flare .",
    "we first analysed the lowest intensity spectrum ( the `` persistent '' pre - flare spectrum , with a net exposure time of 35  ks ) , always fitting together the spectra from the different xis units ( extracted separately ) , with factors included in the spectral fitting to allow for normalization uncertainties between the instruments .",
    "a fit with an absorbed simple power law ( pegpwrlw in xspec ) resulted in positive residuals below 1  kev and in an unphysical very low energy absorption consistent with zero ( resulting in a photon index of 1.5 , with a reduced @xmath28/d.o.f.=1.248/57 ) .",
    "thus in the following we will constrain the absorbing column density to be at least that predicted from optical measurements towards the donor star ( @xmath29=3@xmath2@xmath30 @xmath21 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then added a second component to the power law continuum ( a thermal plasma model , mekal model in xspec ) , to account for the residuals evident at soft energies .",
    "we note that a similar low energy component was also found in the low intensity state observed in 2007 with  @xcite and explained by these authors as the likely x  ray emission from the blue supergiant companion .",
    "the double component model resulted in a much better fit ( @xmath28/d.o.f.=0.811/55 ) , with the spectral parameters reported in table  [ igr08408:tab : spec ] .",
    "if we extrapolate at high energies this best fit , we derive a flux of 4.35@xmath2@xmath31 erg @xmath21 s@xmath1 ( 1540 kev ) , more than one order of magnitude lower than the upper limit we can place with /hxd ( see sect .",
    "[ igr08408:suzredu ] ) .",
    "if interpreted as x  ray emission from the companion star , this soft component should be obviously always present with similar spectral parameters , and with an x  ray luminosity consistent with that usually observed from ob supergiants ( @xmath710@xmath3210@xmath3  erg  @xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus we included it in the fitting model also when analysing the other two spectra from the peak of the two flares .",
    "fitting the first flare peak emission with this double component model ( net exposure time of 7.8  ks ; table  [ igr08408:tab : spec ] ) , we found a good fit ( @xmath28/d.o.f.= @xmath33 ) but with a very low temperature @xmath34 @xmath350.09 kev and a high normalization for this soft component , which translates into an x  ray luminosity ( 0.510  kev ) of 4@xmath210@xmath36  erg  @xmath1 , too high to be compatible with the x  ray emission from the supergiant companion .",
    "thus , we constrained the mekal temperature and its normalization to be within the same variability ranges we obtained from the spectroscopy of the faint persistent spectrum ( table  [ igr08408:tab : spec ] ) , which we verified to be also consistent with the faintest emission observed in 2007 with , and reanalysed here in sect .",

    "the orbital separation derived here implies an orbital period of about 35  days , which is somehow intermediate between the narrow orbits of other sfxts ( e.g. , 3.3  days in igr  j16479 - 4514 , @xcite ) and the longest orbital period measeured to date in a sfxt ( 165  days , @xcite , @xcite ) , whereas it is very similar to that measured in sfxts like , e.g , sax  j1818.61703 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "even the long duration low luminosity emission at a few 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath1 ( close to the quiescent emission observed , e.g. , in igr  j175442619 , @xcite ) is consistent with a wide orbit , in order to allow accretion at a low level .",

    "the observed properties of these flares , their long duration together with the low dynamic range with respect to the pre - flare emission , suggested us to search for other possible explanations , although in the framework of the structure of the supergiant wind . a viable alternative to the accretion of single clumps",
    "could be that the flares are produced from the accretion of large scale wind structures , like gas streams , or the so - called corotating interaction regions ( cirs , @xcite ) .",
