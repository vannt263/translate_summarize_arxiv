    "in thermal field theory , finite - order perturbative expansions break down at high temperatures and one needs to resum higher - order contributions to deal with this problem . on the other hand , also at zero temperature there are situations where higher - order effects may potentially play an important role , even in a small - coupling regime . for instance , it has recently become well known that the behaviour of the standard model ( sm ) effective potential , extrapolated to very high energies , is extremely sensitive to the physics at the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "thus , a formalism to incorporate and resum higher - order effects in a consistent manner is highly desirable for of both thermal and non - thermal applications .",
    "a natural framework to address such problems is the formalism introduced by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis ( cjt )  @xcite .",
    "its simplest version is known as the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action .",
    "this is an effective action expressed not only in terms of the field , but also in terms of dressed propagators .",
    "when one considers a given truncation to the 2pi effective action , at any given order of the loopwise expansion , the 2pi effective action resums , automatically , an infinite set of higher - order diagrams induced by partially resummed propagators , without the danger of over - counting graphs .",
    "so far , the 2pi formalism has been mainly used in thermal contexts , both at equilibrium  @xcite and out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "one of the major limitations for its application to zero - temperature problems like , for example , the study of the sm effective potential , has been the well - known difficulties of the cjt formalism to incorporate symmetries in a satisfactory way . in particular , global symmetries",
    "are not exactly maintained at a given loop order of the 2pi expansion , since they get distorted by higher - order effects , and this results in violation of the goldstone theorem @xcite by higher - order terms , giving rise to a massive goldstone boson in the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) phase of the theory  @xcite . in the past",
    ", several studies were presented in the literature , attempting to provide a satisfactory solution to this problem  ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "we have recently developed a new _ symmetry - improved cjt formalism _  @xcite that addresses this long - standing problem and allows one to consistently use the 2pi effective action to study theories with global symmetries . in the symmetry - improved 2pi formalism , the ward identities ( wis ) associated with global symmetries provide additional constraints for the extremal solutions of the fields and propagators .",
    "this formalism has a number of satisfactory field - theoretical properties , and actually provides an improvement over the standard cjt formulation , in the sense that the behaviour expected for the full theory is recovered already at a low orders of approximation .",
    "the symmetry - improved formalism has been also used to study the chiral phase transition  @xcite , and it has recently been extended to higher @xmath0pi effective actions  @xcite , confirming its consistency also when one goes beyond the 2pi approach .",
    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that the sm effective potential suffers from infrared ( ir ) divergences due to the goldstone bosons of the electroweak gauge group , which appear at three - loop order .",
    "they appear at two loops for the derivative of the potential , i.e. for the minimization condition that fixes the value of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this problem needs to be addressed for a two - fold reason . from the conceptual point of view",
    ", the effective potential should be well - defined for all values of the higgs background field @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , from the quantitative point of view , the appearance of these ir divergences formally lowers the order of the involved three- and higher - loop contributions , thus breaking down perturbation theory and potentially giving a significant contribution to the threshold corrections to the vev . because of the extreme sensitivity of the effective potential extrapolated at high energies to the matching conditions at the electroweak scale , this could result on quantitative sizable effects on the stability analyses of the sm potential .",
    "these issues have been recently addressed by means of an approximate partial resummation procedure , developed in @xcite .",
    "in addition to confirming the disappearance of the ir divergences within our approach , we will show that the more complete 2pi analysis , based on our symmetry - improved formalism , gives quantitatively different results , at least for the scalar sector of the sm .",
    "this suggests that even for the full sm there might be quantitative discrepancies between the approximate resummation scheme of  @xcite and the 2pi approach , thus motivating further studies in this direction  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sections  [ sec : cjt ] and [ sec :",
    "sicjt ] we review the standard and symmetry - improved 2pi formalisms , respectively . in section  [ sec : hf ] we consider the first non - trivial truncation of the effective action , known as the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , for a scalar @xmath2 model , and demonstrate some of the satisfactory field - theoretical properties of the formalism . in section  [ sec : sunset ]",
    "we go beyond this approximation and show that the symmetry - improved approach describes correctly the thresholds of the higgs and goldstone self - energies , in agreement with unitarity requirements .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate explicitly how the formalism implicitly resums sets of processes at arbitrarily high order .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : ir ] we use the symmetry - improved 2pi effective action to study the issue of ir divergences in a global @xmath3 scalar model .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the cjt formalisms . for concreteness , we consider a @xmath4 scalar model and show that , as opposed to the 1pi formalism , loopwise truncations of the cjt generating effective action lead to violation of the goldstone theorem through higher - order terms .",

    "more technical details of the 2pi analysis will be given in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the effective potential @xmath110 of the sm , calculated in perturbation theory , suffers from ir divergences due to the appearance of goldstone bosons in ring diagrams , as shown in figure  [ fig : ir ] . at 3 loops the divergence is logarithmic , but it becomes more and more severe with increasing loop order .",
    "moreover , these divergences are more severe when one considers the derivative of the effective potential @xmath111 . for the latter , ir divergences start from 2-loop order ( see figure  [ fig : ir ] ) .    in perturbation theory",
    "these divergences appear when the tree - level goldstone propagators become massless , i.e. at the tree - level minimum of the potential .",
    "this is instead finite , together with its derivatives , at the dressed minimum @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , this problem needs to be addressed , for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath112 should be well - defined for all values of @xmath1 , not only at its minimum @xmath53 . among other things , the off - shell @xmath49 effective potential governs the dynamics of the background field in inflationary scenarios .",
    "2 .   at the dressed minimum @xmath53 ,",
    "the dressed masses of the goldstone bosons vanish , and this implies that the tree - level mass @xmath113 is formally of the same order as the 1-loop goldstone self - energy @xmath114 .",
    "thus , since starting from 3-loop order the ir divergences of @xmath111 are of the form @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( see figure  [ fig : ir ] ) all _ these higher - loop contributions to @xmath111 are formally at 2-loop order_. this means that perturbation theory breaks down and these diagrams can potentially have a significant impact on 2-loop results for @xmath111 , i.e. on the state - of - the - art threshold corrections to the vev @xmath48 . in view of the extreme sensitivity of the sm effective potential , extrapolated at very high energies , to the matching conditions at the electroweak scale  @xcite , these issues can potentially affect the stability analyses of the sm .",
    "moreover , a seemingly unrelated problem is that the tree - level mass of the goldstone boson can be negative at the dressed minimum @xmath53 , thus generating an unphysical imaginary part for the sm effective potential at its minimum , which does not correspond to a true instability of the homogeneous vacuum .",
    "this fact should be contrasted with the discussion in section  [ sec : sicjt ] , where we have shown that the symmetry - improved effective potential acquires an imaginary part only in the concave region corresponding to a physical instability .",
    "this suggests that a resummation of higher - loop diagrams is needed to address this conceptual issue as well .",
    "finally , we point out that the location of the ir divergence depends on the value of the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath117 , but the divergence is nonetheless present in any renormalizable @xmath118 gauge at the value of the field @xmath1 for which @xmath119 .    rlrlrl @xmath120{ggh}}$ ] & @xmath121 & @xmath122{gbgb}}$ ] & @xmath123 & @xmath122{gbgbgb}}$ ] & @xmath124 +    ' '' ''    @xmath125{ggh}}$ ] & @xmath123 & @xmath126{gbgb}}$ ] & @xmath124 & @xmath126{gbgbgb}}$ ] & @xmath127      let us outline the approximate partial resummation procedure presented in  @xcite to address these ir issues . to facilitate an objective comparison with the 2pi approach discussed in this work",

    "although this does not allow to draw quantitative conclusion for the complete sm case , this simplified model is sufficient to study this issue qualitatively and to compare the results obtained in the 2pi approach with the ones in  @xcite .",
    "the partial resummation procedure consists in considering ring diagrams , as in figure  [ fig : ir ] , with insertions of 1-loop goldstone self - energies @xmath128 .",
    "one approximates these 1-loop self - energies with their zero - momentum value @xmath129 . with this important simplification",

    "finally , one needs to subtract from @xmath110 the diagrams that would be double - counted otherwise . in conclusion ,",
    "one adds to the effective potential the term  @xcite : @xmath132 \\ - \\ v_{\\mathrm{eff } , g}^{(d.c.)}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the contribution of the double - counted diagrams , as discussed above .",
    "as we show in figure  [ fig : ir_pert ] for the scalar sector of the sm , this procedure effectively resums the ir divergences present in @xmath134 at two- and three - loop orders .",
    "we include only the 3-loop contributions coming from the goldstone ring diagrams in figure  [ fig : ir ] , since they are proportional to @xmath135 and so responsible for the ir divergence .",
    "moreover , as we discussed above , their order gets formally lowered at the dressed minimum .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]      we now study these issues by means of the symmetry - improved 2pi formalism .",
    "this provides a more complete resummation , as compared to the approach outlined above , for several reasons .",
    "first , it is a first - principle approach , and no ad - hoc subtraction is needed .",
    "second , as we are going to show below , the 2pi approach takes into account more topologies and does not necessitate to neglect the momentum dependence of the self - energy insertions that are resummed .",
    "moreover , as we showed in the previous section , the threshold properties are correctly described within the symmetry - improved formalism . in particular , the goldstone propagator in the formalism is massless at the dressed minimum of the potential and nevertheless the effective potential will be shown to be free of ir pathologies .",
    "we consider the global @xmath3 scalar model . by including , in the eoms , the 1-loop ( hf + sunset ) cjt diagrams shown in the first line of figure  [ fig : eom ] we actually resum , automatically , a large class of diagrams , as depicted in figure  [ fig : resum_1loop ] .",
    "moreover , in order to be able to compare our results with the perturbative 2-loop calculation , we include the 2-loop cjt diagrams in the second line of figure  [ fig : eom ] .",
    "however , to simplify the treatment , we approximate the propagators appearing in these diagrams as the tree - level ones @xmath136 . in this way , we take into account the full contribution of 2-loop topologies and , in addition , resum diagrams as the ones shown in figure  [ fig : resum_2loop ] .",

    "the ir pathologies originate from chains of goldstone lines with self - energy insertions between them .",
    "however , such topologies are necessarily _ 2-particle - reducible _ and thus do not appear in the diagrammatic series of @xmath26 $ ] .",
