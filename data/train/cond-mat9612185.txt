    "since its discovery , the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) has provided the experimental setting for new ideas in condensed matter physics , as well the inspiration for new ones .",
    "for example , the qhe establishes a clean experimental realization of strongly correlated one - dimensional luttinger liquids .",
    "it was noted first in x.  g.  wen s seminal work on the theory of edge states of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids that the gapless edge modes were a realization of a ( chiral ) luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "one of wen s first proposals for testing these ideas was to do experiments that would probe tunneling between the edges of qh states@xcite .",
    "he predicted that in experiments in qh _ junctions _ , the tunneling current should exhibit a power law dependence on the applied voltage with an exponent determined by the topological order of the bulk qh liquid .",
    "for a qh state with a single edge the exponent is determined solely by the filling fraction @xmath0 .",
    "tunneling in qh states is conceptually related to the problem of scattering of quasiparticles in quantum wires ( qw ) which are non - chiral luttinger liquids . c.",
    "kane and m.  p.  a.  fisher have given a physical picture of tunneling in luttinger liquids in the form of a renormalization group theory for both chiral and non - chiral liquids .",
    "in particular , they predicted the nonlinear @xmath5 characteristics and the universal shape of the conductance peaks .",
    "experimentally , the power law scaling of the tunneling current on voltage and temperature in luttinger liquids has been observed by two groups .",
    "milliken , umbach and webb @xcite used a gated quantum point - contact to bring the edges of a fqh state closer so as to observe the tunneling current .",
    "this is an experimental realization of tunneling _ between _ the edge states of qh liquids .",
    "more recently , chang , pfeiffer and west @xcite measured electron tunneling from a bulk doped - gaas electron gas _ into _ the abrupt edge of a fqh state .",
    "the latter experiment is particularly interesting for the following reasons .",
    "first , it is able to observe the power law behavior over more than one decade in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "secondly , the device used in the experiment is an effective tool to address experimentally the study of how a bulk electron gas serves as reservoir when in contact to sharply defined fqh liquids .",
    "qh tunneling junctions are an ideal setting to study the physical properties of bulk qh liquids and , in particular , the nature of their quasiparticles .",
    "these properties determine the power law behavior of the nonlinear @xmath5 curves .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath5 characteristics is just one of the many aspects of this rich problem .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the problem of tunneling in chiral luttinger liquids is described by rich quantum field theories with a non - trivial spectrum , exhibiting a weak - to - strong coupling duality symmetry @xcite . for special values of the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath8 , the model is exactly solvable via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the conductance is known for all values of @xmath8 in terms of dual series expansions for the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the noise spectrum contains structures related to the fractional charge and statistics of the tunneling particles , and it is believed to be a non - analytic function of @xmath8 for finite frequencies @xcite .",
    "hence , tunneling experiments to qh edges provide a unique window to study the rich and deep physics of chiral luttinger liquids beyond the determination of their asymptotic scaling behavior .",
    "experimental devices similar to those of a.  chang _ et .",
    "_ can be used to address such conceptual issues . moreover",
    ", these devices also provide a means for studying mesoscopic effects arising from different ways of coupling the reservoirs ( the bulk electron gas ) to the fqh states@xcite .",
    "we have learned in recent years that the transport properties of strongly correlated states depend delicately on the properties of the contacts or reservoirs .",
    "this is the case for 1d quantum wires , which display quantized conductances in agreement with non - interacting electrons , despite the renormalization which should be expected from the electron - electron interactions in infinite systems .",
    "it may seem _ a priori _ that there should be a clear distinction between non - chiral luttinger liquids ( quantum wires ) and chiral ones ( edge states ) , for the quantized hall conductance is not altered by the reservoirs @xcite .",
    "however , we will see below that this is a rather subtle issue .",
    "the physics of tunneling of _ electrons _ from a reservoir to the edges of a qh liquid is determined by the physical properties of the qh _",
    "quasiparticles_. the natural question that arises is whether it is possible to use qh junctions to access the properties of the quasiparticles of fractional quantum hall states , in particular their fractional charge .",
    "the question of how to observe a fractionally charged quasiparticle of a strongly correlated system is a rather old problem .",
    "it has been considered in detail in the context of the soliton states in quasi - one - dimensional conductors such as polyacetylene@xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that noise experiments in both polyacetylene@xcite and in qh junctions could be used to measure the fractional charge .",
    "however , experimental attempts to measure noise in both physical systems have encountered a number of significant technical and conceptual difficulties . observing a fractionally charged excitation from a bulk fqh state by tunneling from a known state ( the reservoir )",
    "depends on the nature of both the reservoir and the contacts@xcite . in the context of the fqhe , the proposed noise experiments rely on the theoretical picture in which edge states of fqhe liquids are _ assumed _ to be in equilibrium with a hypothetical reservoir of _ quasiparticles _ which are then allowed to tunnel . however , any experimental setup must consist of _ electrons _ tunneling in and out of one or several reservoirs into a fqh liquid .",
    "the edge excitations of the fqh liquid by themselves can not equilibrate since the liquid by itself does not dissipate and there is no loss of phase coherence .",
    "the real loss of phase coherence ( and the resulting dissipation ) originates in the electron reservoir , _",
    "i.  e. _ in the external leads .",
    "hence , the question to be addressed is how the tunneling of _ electrons _ into a fqh system is affected by the nature of the quasiparticles of the fqh liquid and by the equilibration mechanism .",
    "it is then natural to ask for what class of contacts ( _ i .",
    "e. _ couplings with external leads ) it is possible to use tunneling experiments to reveal the nature of the fqh quasiparticles .",
    "this is the main motivation of this work .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to develop a conceptual framework for the study of the non - perturbative physics of tunneling into a chiral luttinger liquid from a reservoir",
    ". we will be interested on the physics of these systems at general voltages and temperatures or , equivalently , in the crossover from weak to strong coupling .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we discuss the problem of tunneling to single edge qh liquids .",
    "recently , kane and fisher described the behavior of a junction between a qh state and reservoirs in the weak coupling regime where they found that the two - terminal conductance is _ not _ universal .",
    "in this paper we will show that in the strong coupling limit , the two - terminal conductance through a fqh state with filling fraction @xmath0 becomes _",
    "universal_. this is the regime we will be primarily interested in . in particular , we will show that different ways of coupling to a principal fqh state with @xmath10 can lead to values of the two - terminal conductances such as @xmath11 ( the usual one ) , @xmath12 or simply @xmath13 .",
    "the main tool that we will use in this work is a mapping ( that we present below ) of the problem of tunneling from a higher dimensional electron gas to the edges of a qh liquid to an _ exactly _ equivalent problem of tunneling from a single - channel chiral fermi liquid and the same qh edge .",
    "this is applicable if the coupling is made via a single point - like contact .",
    "the injected electrons in the qh edge states , as we show , are _ not _ in equilibrium with the reservoirs , and this is the origin of the renormalized conductance .",
    "equilibration is recovered if the coupling to the qh state is made through many contacts . in the case of many contacts we obtain an @xmath5 characteristic and compare it with recent experimental data by a.  chang _ et .",
    "al . _ for the full range of probed voltages .",
    "this mapping can also be used to describe the problem of tunneling of electrons from external leads to a non - chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sum ] we summarize the basic physical picture and results . in section [ sec : oneimp ] we show that the tunneling from a generic electron gas to a fqh liquid through a point contact is equivalent to tunneling from an effective _ chiral _ fermi liquid to the edges of the same fqh state . using this mapping we solve non - perturbatively several cases of interest , showing that the two - terminal conductance can assume distinct universal values depending on the nature of the contacts . in section [ sec",
    ": one - half ] we show that the @xmath14 to @xmath3 qh junction is an experimental realization of the problem of tunneling between two @xmath4 chiral luttinger liquids .",
    "this is an important theoretical system since it is exactly solvable for all correlation functions . in section [ sec : many ] we discuss the role of multiple tunneling processes in the equilibration of qh edge states . in this section",
    "we derive a universal crossover function for the conductance of an electron gas to a qh edge state for arbitrary voltages and temperature through a large number of individually weak tunneling junctions . since the number of junctions is large , the effective coupling is large and this system can not be described perturbatively .",
    "the crossover function has a remarkable resemblance to a kondo - like effect . at large voltages",
    "the conductance saturates at @xmath15 .",
    "we use this crossover function to fit the experimental data of a.  chang _ et .",
    "_ over the entire range of voltages@xcite .",
    "we also give a set of asymptotic values of the universal conductance in the strong coupling limit for a generalized problem of @xmath16 contacts to left and right reservoirs .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] is devoted to the conclusions . in the appendix we present the details of the mapping of a high dimensional electron gas to a one - dimensional chiral fermi liquid for tunneling through a single impurity",
    "in this paper we show that for the purposes of studying tunneling between an electron gas and a chiral luttinger liquid , the electron gas behaves as an effective chiral fermi liquid . the idea , although simple , is strongly justified for reasons other than simply looking at the algebraic decay of the electron green s function . just as in the kondo problem , scattering through a point - like impurity potential can be understood in terms of the radial motion of an effective one - dimensional non - chiral fermion on a semi - infinite line ( see for example ref .  ) . by unfolding the line around the impurity ,",
    "one obtains a chiral fermion on an infinite line .",
    "thus , it is well grounded to expect that , for the problem of tunneling through a single point , the electron gas that makes up the reservoir should behave exactly in the same way as a chiral fermi liquid or the edge of a sharp @xmath14 qh state .",
    "this mode selection works regardless of the number of spatial dimensions of the electron gas in the reservoir .",
    "one can think of this construction as the cleanest , easiest , let alone cheapest , ( virtual ) realization of a sharp edge of a @xmath14 qh state ( @xmath17 ) !",
    "we consider in detail the case of tunneling between an electron gas and a qh liquid belonging to the principal sequence ( laughlin ) @xmath10 , @xmath18 integer .",
    "as noted above , the electron gas can be regarded as a chiral fermi liquid , so we have at hand the problem of studying tunneling between luttinger liquids with different @xmath8 .",
    "we perform a change of basis in order to rescale the radii of the bosonic fields describing the chiral branches and in this way we map the problem of tunneling from an electron gas to the edges of a laughlin fqh liquid with filling fraction @xmath0 to the problem of tunneling between two identical chiral luttinger liquids with @xmath19 .    using this framework",
    ", we point to new experimentally accessible features of quantum hall liquids which are consequences of the chiral luttinger liquid nature of the edge states .",
    "for example , we show that in a two - terminal conductance experiment where one of the contacts is a point - like tunneling center between a fqh liquid and an electron gas ( reservoir ) , the conductance in the strong coupling limit is larger than the hall conductance , but universally related to it .",
    "more explicitly , the two - terminal conductance for strong tunneling ( or high voltages ) to a laughlin fqh state of filling fraction @xmath0 is @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that the electrons injected into the fqh liquid will be hotter ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , higher voltage ) than those in the reservoir .",
    "the tunneling contact is thus a springboard for raising the chemical potential@xcite .",
    "since the injected electron is hotter than the reservoir , one might ask how to restore an equilibrium between the qh liquid and the reservoir .",
    "we address this problem by considering the effects of many impurities .",
    "it was first pointed out by kane and fisher that the equilibration mechanism between qh liquids and reservoirs could be understood in terms of tunneling through a line of weak coupling impurities , which would bring the voltage along the edge states monotonically to equilibrium with the reservoirs . in this paper",
    "we show that the same is true in the case of strong coupling impurities",
    ". the only difference between these two situations is that , as the number of impurities increases , the voltage of the qh edge oscillates around the asymptotic equilibrium value .",
    "one consequence of the equilibration with the reservoirs is that the two - terminal conductance acquires the value of the bulk hall conductance .",
    "the dependence of the two - terminal conductance on the way the reservoirs are coupled to the fqh liquid is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show the usual case where the two - terminal conductance equals the hall conductance @xmath11 . in this case , the hall voltage @xmath20 , and the edges are in equilibrium with their respective reservoirs of departure .",
    "the contacts are made through many points in this case . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b one reservoir is coupled through many points , whereas the other is coupled through one single quantum channel , or point - like contact . in this case , one edge branch is in equilibrium with one reservoir ( @xmath21 ) , but the other is not ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the two - terminal conductance in this case is @xmath23 , _ larger _ than the hall conductance , and thus the hall voltage is _ higher _ than the two - terminal voltage difference ( @xmath24 ) . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c both contacts to the qh state are point - like , and neither edge branch is in equilibrium with either of the two reservoirs . the two - terminal conductance is @xmath13 , again _ larger _ than the hall conductance , and the hall voltage is also _ higher _ than the two - terminal one ( @xmath25 ) . in this last case , there is an analogy to the problem of unrenormalized conductances in quantum wires ; there is one quantum channel going in and out of the strongly correlated qh state , so that the conductance is @xmath2 regardless of the filling fraction @xmath10 .",
    "= 2.4 in    the devices depicted in fig [ fig1 ] are particular cases of the general problem of connecting a laughlin fqh liquid with @xmath26 point - contacts to the left reservoir , and @xmath27 point - contacts to the right one . for strong coupling",
    "( which can always be achieved for large enough voltages ) , we find that the universal conductance @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\nu-1}{\\nu+1}\\right)^{n_r}\\right ] } { \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\nu-1}{\\nu+1}\\right)^{n_l+n_r}\\right ] } \\",
    "\\nu\\frac{e^2}{h}\\ , \\ ] ] which reproduces the cases in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    in this paper",
    "we also consider in detail the problem of _ equilibration _ in the presence of many impurities or contacts coupling a reservoir to the qh liquid .",
    "the case of many impurities is treated in the following way .",
    "the propagation in the reservoir side between spatially separated impurities takes place incoherently .",
    "moreover , after scattering from a point - like contact to the qh liquid , the energy of the scattered electron would drop on the chiral fermi branch , but would then be brought back to equilibrium with the reservoir .",
    "thus , electrons incident into any of the impurities from the reservoir side will always be at the same voltage .",
    "on the qh liquid side , however , the energy of the scattered electron is maintained from one scattering event to another , because of the dissipationless nature of the qh state .",
    "multi - impurity scattering will bring , eventually , the qh edge to equilibrium with the reservoir .",
    "this scattering mechanism allows one to obtain the solution of the many impurity problem from the single impurity one .",
    "notice that the behavior of the electrons in the reservoir side , namely loss of phase memory and equilibration , is what provides the simplification needed in solving the multi - impurity case . clearly , incoherence is a key assumption here .",
    "it must hold for well separated impurities which should act essentially independently from each other .",
    "this situation is familiar from the physics of dilute magnetic alloys where the kondo impurities are indeed independent from each other .",
    "it is also clear that as the impurities ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the contacts ) become closer to each other , coherence effects in the reservoir should become important . in this limit",
    ", we expect a richer and more complex quantum behavior much like the multi - impurity or multichannel behavior in kondo systems .",
    "we use this framework for the multi - impurity case and apply it to obtain a solution for the case of tunneling , through many impurities , from an electron gas to a @xmath3 liquid , which is of direct relevance for comparison to the experiments of a. chang _ et .",
    "we show that the mechanism that we consider in this work contains the necessary ingredients to explain not only the low voltage , low temperature power law behavior , but also the breakdown voltage scale for deviations from the anomalous power law scaling . in addition , it predicts the asymptotic large voltage conductances , which should saturate at the bulk value of the hall conductance @xmath33 .",
    "we show that the conductance between the electron gas and the @xmath3 fqh state is given by @xmath34^{3/2}}\\right\\}\\ , \\label{fullconductanceintro}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the temperature and @xmath35 is a crossover energy scale determined by the couplings of _ all _ impurities connecting the electron gas to the qh state .",
    "the only assumption made in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ fullconductanceintro ] ) is that individual impurities are weakly coupled .",
    "this assumption , as we show , does not restrict the result to the regime of small conductances since the scale @xmath35 can actually take a broad range of values .",
    "hence the expression should remain valid even for voltages large compared to @xmath35 and conductances as large as the bulk hall value @xmath33 ( this point is made clear below ) .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ fullconductanceintro ] ) can be used for comparison with the experimental data .",
    "one can easily check that , for @xmath36 , eq . ( [ fullconductanceintro ] ) reproduces the scaling form used in ref .",
    "the voltage scale for which the experimental data departs from the low voltage scaling form is determined by the energy scale @xmath35 , which is evident in eq.([fullconductanceintro ] ) .",
    "this breakdown voltage scale can be determined from the low voltage data , since the amplitude of the tunneling conductance is directly related to @xmath35 and @xmath7 : @xmath37\\ .\\ ] ] therefore , the `` breakdown '' voltage is indeed part of the full solution to the problem of tunneling into the fqh edge .",
    "one should not overlook the fact that the experimentally measured conductance saturates to the hall value @xmath38 .",
    "this is a signature of many impurities , and it is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ fullconductanceintro ] ) .",
    "we contrast this case to the one impurity contact ( to one of the reservoirs , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , for which the two - terminal conductance should reach the value @xmath39 , and electrons enter the edge of the qh liquid hotter than the reservoir .    finally , we would like to point out that , as a natural consequence of the physics of the point - contact junctions between bulk electron gases and fqh states that are discussed here , these junctions constitute a simple physical realization of the dc voltage transformer proposed very recently by chklovskii and halperin .",
    "the point - contact junctions are more readily realizable and possibly avoid many of the difficulties discussed by chklovskii and halperin .",
    "our starting point is the lagrangian density that describes the dynamics on the edge of the fqh liquid , the electron gas reservoirs , and the tunneling between the two via a single impurity : @xmath40 the edge excitations of a fqh liquid with @xmath10 are described by a single free chiral boson field @xmath41 with @xmath42 and equal - time commutation relation @xmath43=-i\\pi\\ { \\rm sgn}(x - y)$ ] .",
    "the edge electron operator is written in terms of the boson field as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 is the lagrangian for the electron gas , with @xmath46 the electron operator there .",
    "the tunneling lagrangian is then @xmath47 the josephson frequency @xmath48 is set by the difference of voltages between the electron gas and the _ incoming _ edge branch to the impurity . as we will see later , the voltage for the _ outgoing _ branch is raised due to tunneling .    the next step is the mapping between a 2d or 3d electron gas to a 1d chiral fermi liquid for tunneling through a single impurity .",
    "we follow the conventional procedure used in the theory of the kondo problem ( see , for instance , ref .  )",
    "where it is shown that the problem of a single isotropic magnetic impurity coupled to a three - dimensional fermi liquid is mapped to the problem of a one - dimensional chiral fermi liquid coupled to the impurity .",
    "the same conclusions hold for any number of dimensions greater than one . in the kondo problem",
    ", one basically writes the electron wavefunction @xmath49 in a spherically symmetric basis , with the origin at the impurity position @xmath50 .",
    "the operator @xmath51 depends only on the @xmath52 harmonic , so that this is the only channel that participates in coupling to the impurity . for the case of two dimensions ,",
    "only the @xmath53 channel is coupled .",
    "one may worry that if the impurity is on the planar boundary of the 3d electron gas , the spherical symmetry is spoiled .",
    "however , the spherical symmetry is not a necessary condition to arrive at the conclusion that only one quantum channel is coupled via the impurity .",
    "we show in appendix [ appendiximp ] , for a very general set of problems , that one can always find a basis of eigenstates of the hamiltonian for the electron gas such that only one quantum channel couples to the impurity , and again only the radial components of that channel are important .",
    "the electron operator for this channel can be written in terms of left and right moving fermions on a half line , which is the radial coordinate @xmath54 ( left and right moving particles correspond to incoming and outgoing particles with respect to the impurity ) . by unfolding the half line into a full line",
    ", one can describe the electron operators in terms of a single chiral fermion on an infinite line .",
    "therefore , for tunneling through a point - like contact , the semi - infinite 3d electron gas becomes effectively equivalent to a 1d chiral fermi liquid .",
    "it can be regarded in much the same way as if it were a sharp edge of @xmath14 qh state .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath55 where @xmath56 labels the quantum numbers of the channel that couples to the impurity ( which depend on the symmetry in the problem , such as @xmath52 for the kondo problem ) . we can then bosonize the @xmath57 effective chiral 1d mode corresponding to the ( unfolded ) radial direction : @xmath58 with the electron operator given ( in terms of @xmath59 ) by @xmath60 .    we are free to rescale the position coordinates and thus alter the velocities . moreover , because the tunneling takes place at a point , and also the two chiral boson fields @xmath41 and @xmath59 are in separate spaces , we are free to rescale the position coordinates independently , allowing us to set both @xmath61 .",
    "( notice that even though we used the same symbol @xmath62 for the coordinates of both fields , @xmath62 separately parametrizes the fields along their arc length .",
    "the only commom point in the parametrization is @xmath63 , which is the impurity location . )",
    "the tunneling problem is then described by the lagrangian @xmath64 we can bring the tunneling term to more familiar forms by means of a rotation . instead of doing this directly for eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) , let us treat a more general problem",
    ". consider tunneling between a @xmath65 and a @xmath66 qh state , with both @xmath67 odd integers ( single edges ) .",
    "the tunneling coupling is @xmath68 where we have performed the @xmath69 rotation @xmath70 with @xmath71 the tunneling term corresponds to tunneling between two chiral luttinger liquids with @xmath72 in particular , since we showed that the electron gas couples to a single impurity through only one quantum channel ( see appendix [ appendiximp ] ) , it is effectively equivalent to a 1d chiral fermi liquid ( virtual @xmath14 ) , and so we have @xmath73 where @xmath0 is the filling fraction of the qh state coupled to the electron gas ( reservoir ) through the single impurity .",
    "we can then use the known results for tunneling between two luttinger liquids and apply to the problem of tunneling from an electron gas to the edge of a fqh liquid .",
    "we can , for example , determine the current injected into the edge branch , which depends on the voltage difference between the electron gas and the _ incoming _ branch to the impurity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "because of the weak - strong coupling duality symmetry present in the problem of tunneling between luttinger liquids , we can also turn to the dual picture corresponding to tunneling between two luttinger liquids with @xmath74    the differential tunneling conductance depends on both @xmath8 ( or @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 . at zero temperature ,",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath6 is the voltage difference between the reservoir and the incoming edge branch , @xmath76 .",

    "we now turn to the case of strong coupling ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , or equivalently , large voltage differences ( @xmath86 ) . in this case",
    ", the tunneling conductance reaches the strong coupling asymptotic value @xmath87 .",
    "we then apply this result to the geometries depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this is the case shown in fig .",
    "one edge branch is in equilibrium with its reservoir of departure ( @xmath21 ) , because this contact is made through many impurities ( see section [ sec : many ] ) . for the other contact ,",
    "the value of the voltage level @xmath88 depends on the injected current from the right reservoir .",
    "the injected current for strong coupling is given by @xmath89 and consequently @xmath90 thus , the voltage @xmath88 is given by @xmath91 and the hall voltage is @xmath92    the two - terminal conductance of the device ( determined from @xmath93 ) is @xmath94      this is the case shown in fig .",
    "neither of the edge branches is in equilibrium with either reservoir .",
    "we have to determine the voltages from the tunneling currents in both contacts .",
    "the voltages @xmath88 and @xmath95 are obtained from @xmath96 which give @xmath97 the hall voltage is given by @xmath98    the current flowing through the device is @xmath99 and therefore the two - terminal conductance is @xmath100    this result is the universal conductance for spinless non - interacting electrons .",
    "it resembles the result for the conductance of quantum wires , where the reservoirs mask the ( non - chiral ) luttinger liquid behavior of the 1d wire .",
    "we can understand why there is such correspondence in a very simple way . because the contacts are made to the two reservoirs at a single point each , we can deform the edges of the qh state so as to bring them to line up on top of each other at a segment that connects the two contacts .",
    "the end result is that the two opposite chiralities overlap on the same segment ( see fig .",
    "[ fignoncll ] ) , which makes the problem the same as its non - chiral counterpart of ref . .",
    "notice also that we have shown that , for point - like contacts to the reservoirs , the electron gas making up the external lead behaves effectively as a 1d chiral fermi liquid , which was the model for the leads that maslov and stone proposed recently . in their picture , the non - chiral luttinger liquid of a quantum wire turned adiabatically into a fermi liquid ( describing the leads ) which they also took to be a one - dimensional fermi system .",
    "our mapping shows that only one mode of the electrons in the reservoir will effectively tunnel into the luttinger liquid .",
    "furthermore , even if the coupling between the leads and the wire is very smooth , there are always backscattering processes at the crossover .",
    "these processes are always relevant operators and the system always flows to strong coupling where the tunneling picture is accurate .",
    "thus , the mapping presented here provides a formal justification of the model of maslov and stone .",
    "having mentioned the similarities , let us now look at the _ important _ differences between transmitting current in quantum wires and fqh liquids .",
    "the chiral 1d luttinger liquid in the case of the fqhe comes from the edges of the 2d strongly correlated fqh liquid , and we can explore the extra one dimension experimentally .",
    "for example , one can measure voltages at the two edges ( @xmath88 and @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) because they are spatially separated , and by doing so probe luttinger liquid behavior between the reservoirs .",
    "this is not possible in the case of quantum wires , for the two chiralities are mixed and one can not measure the two chemical potentials separately inside the wire .",
    "a measurement of the hall voltage @xmath101 returns a value that is _ larger _ than the two - terminal voltage ( @xmath102 ) by a factor of @xmath103 ; this factor contains information on the luttinger liquid behavior between the reservoirs which is experimentally measurable , and has no counterpart in quantum wires .",
    "another important difference between quantum wires and devices such as the ones we discuss in this paper is that quantum wires can be connected to leads in only one way ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , one end to each lead ) , whereas we can connect a fqh state ( a 2d system ) to , say , @xmath26 contacts to one reservoir and @xmath27 to the other .",
    "the consequence is that in quantum wires one can only observe a conductance @xmath2 ( and multiples of it ) , whereas for fqh states the conductance @xmath28 , as we show in section [ sec : many ] , can take values in whole families of rational multiples of @xmath2 .",
    "( examples are the cases shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]b and [ fig1]c , which correspond to @xmath30 and @xmath104 , respectively . )    in summary , the strong coupling ( large voltage ) value of the tunneling conductance from a reservoir ( _ i.  e.  _ , a fermi liquid ) to the chiral luttinger liquids of the edges of a fqh state , in spite of being universal , depends not only on the properties of the fqh liquid but also on the nature of the contacts .",
    "moreover , the physics of the edge states of the fqh states can be probed with a variety of junctions for which there is no counterpart in one - dimensional quantum wires .",
    "a very interesting case is when @xmath3 , in which case @xmath105 .",
    "this case is the dual point to @xmath106 , which is exactly solvable , not only for the conductance , but for the full noise spectrum ( indeed , _ all _ @xmath107-point correlation functions ) .",
    "this non - trivial exactly solvable point is very important theoretically because it provides the comparison ground for any result obtained perturbatively .",
    "before , it was simply a theoretical tool , with no physical realization .",
    "the tunneling from an electron gas to a @xmath3 state makes it now possible to study the important @xmath4 state experimentally .",
    "let us focus on this @xmath4 case and a single impurity .",
    "the exact solution ( see refs .",
    "and references therein ) for the tunneling current and differential conductance is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the fermi distribution , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath112 and @xmath35 are , besides the temperature , the two energy scales in the problem .",
    "as one varies the voltage , the current and conductance scaling with @xmath6 changes depending on the relative value of @xmath6 as compared to @xmath7 and @xmath35 .",
    "consider , for example , the case when @xmath113 .",
    "in this case , the conductance scales as @xmath114 the anomalous scaling of the current with voltage that is characteristic of luttinger liquids takes place between the two energy scales @xmath7 and @xmath35 . in recent experiments , chang _ et .",
    "al . _ have observed such scaling . in the experimental data , the @xmath115 power law scaling breaks down at a certain voltage .",
    "one is inclined to think that @xmath35 provides the energy scale for the breakdown , although in that particular experiment tunneling takes place not through one , but many impurities .",
    "the idea that there is another energy scale in the problem , however , is still an important one , and we will show that indeed such a breakdown scale also occur for the many impurity problem .",
    "we will here show how to treat the problem of tunneling from an electron gas or reservoir to a qh liquid via many impurities . in the previous section we considered scattering through a single impurity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in which case the incident edge channel comes at a voltage level @xmath116 , and the electron from the reservoir at @xmath117 . after scattering , the edge is at @xmath118 , and the reservoir branch at @xmath119 .",
    "we will obtain the many impurity result by considering the single scattering event as building blocks , and cascading them .",
    "an important issue for this cascading is that of how the scattered electrons on the reservoir side behave differently from those in the qh side in between scattering events . in the reservoir side , regardless of the voltage after scattering , the electrons will equilibrate with the reservoir by the time of the next scattering event .",
    "it will also lose its phase memory .",
    "this means that on the reservoir side , electrons will always arrive for the scattering events at the same voltage , namely , @xmath117 . on the qh side , however , the voltage is maintained between scattering events , and is accumulated .",
    "thus , the cascade can be assembled as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the voltages past the @xmath107-th stage of the cascade are labeled @xmath120 , and the current flowing from the reservoir to the qh liquid is @xmath121 .",
    "the voltage difference between the outgoing ( @xmath120 ) and incoming ( @xmath122 ) edge states is obtained from the current @xmath121 and the hall conductance for the qh liquid : @xmath123 now , the current @xmath121 is simply the single impurity tunneling current , which depends on the incoming state ( @xmath124 ) and the coupling strength for the @xmath107-th impurity , as well as the temperature .",
    "the coupling strength enters as an effective temperature @xmath125 for a given impurity .",
    "notice , however , that the voltages @xmath120 alone are not sufficient to describe the quantum states at the different stages of the cascade .",
    "one needs the states @xmath126 , where the @xmath127 are the occupation numbers of the oscillator modes of the chiral boson @xmath41 describing the edge state .",
    "the voltage @xmath120 measures the total charge or the zero mode of the boson field .",
    "the non - zero modes should in principle affect the @xmath5 characteristics for each impurity .",
    "an intuitive picture one can use to see the effects of the excited oscillator modes is that they could account for an `` effective '' increase in the temperature ( since a higher temperature brings more excited modes ) .",
    "this `` effective '' increase in the temperature enters in the expression for the tunneling current , in addition to the voltages @xmath120 and @xmath128 .    nonetheless , there are two regimes where the oscillator modes are not excited : weak and strong coupling .",
    "effects due to the oscillator modes , as described above , become only important at intermediate coupling .",
    "for the weak and strong coupling cases we can simply use the @xmath5 characteristics for a single impurity to obtain recursively the voltages @xmath120 for all @xmath107 , and we can obtain the total current that flows to the qh liquid from @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the last impurity on the line , and @xmath131 is the initial voltage level of the edge ( in equilibrium with the other reservoir ) .",
    "the recursion equation is @xmath132 let us study solutions of these recursion relations for different regimes of tunneling strengths",
    ".      without loss of generality , let us concentrate on the case @xmath133 .",

    "a related issue is that if we use @xmath171 , we find that the data is best fitted with values of @xmath35 which are approximately half of those obtained for @xmath173 .",
    "this is a rather large change .",
    "a possible explanation is that subleading irrelevant tunneling operators are also coupled .",

    "thus , for large enough voltages , tunneling proceeds as if the coupling were strong , even if the nominal coupling constants are finite . in this regime , for each individual impurity , the conductance saturates at the value @xmath175 , so that we have a recursion @xmath176 which has a solution @xmath177\\ .\\ ] ] again , we have used that @xmath147 is the voltage at the incoming edge branch , which is equilibrium with the other reservoir .",
