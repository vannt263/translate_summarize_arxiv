    "its accuracy turns out to be high enough to demonstrate the most important specific features of the time evolution of experimental tresr spectra of p@xmath9p@xmath10-pairs .",

    "the observed bits between lines of experimental spectra at @xmath135 and @xmath136 are somewhat deeper than those , obtained in the considered model .",
    "this discrepancy can be caused by the approximation of partially inhomogeneous broadening of the tresr spectra by homogeneous one , which results in relatively broad wings of lines .",
    "the fact is that the homogeneous mechanism predicts lorentzian line shape with slowly decreasing wings while the inhomogeneous mechanism usually yields gaussian one with very rapidly decreasing wings .",
    "the slower decrease of lorentzian lines can certainly lead to less deep bits between lorentzian lines than those between gaussian ones .    concluding discussion we would like to draw attention to the fact that e / a - distortion of tresr spectra , observed at small times @xmath137 and @xmath138 is changed by the a / e - one at longer times @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "of course , at long times relative distortion amplitudes are fairly small , but still quite pronounced and distinguishable .",

    "the analysis is mainly based on exact numerical solution of the sle within the model of the exponentially decaying polaron pairs , spin - evolution of which is described by the spin - hamiltonian ( [ gform2 ] ) , spin - selective reactivity ( [ gform5 ] ) , and spin relaxation of two types : free polaron relaxation ( [ gform3 ] ) and spin - exchange - induced one ( [ gform5a ] ) .    according to the analysis , in p@xmath9p@xmath10-pairs ( in polymer : fullerene blend under study ) the spin dephasing is much faster than the population relaxation .",
    "this relation allows for approximate analytical analysis of tresr spectra , providing deep insight into distinctive properties of the time dependence of spectra .",
    "these properties are found to be determined by the specific features of antiphase ( aps ) and population - relaxation affected @xmath171-cidep contributions .",
    "the combined numerical / analytical analysis shows that the generation of the contributions is governed by sophisticated interplay of coherent spin evolution and spin - relaxation / recombination of p@xmath9p@xmath17 pairs .",
    "it is found , in particular , that the observed short time tresr spectra ( of the shape of conventional aps with large e / a components ) are , actually , the sums of aps and @xmath171-cidep contributions of comparable amplitude . as for the long time spectra ,",
    "they are determined by the population - relaxation affected spin - selective recombination of p@xmath9p@xmath17 pairs .",

    "( [ spepr10 g ] ) . for the singlet initial condition this mechanism predicts the change of the sign of both contributions with time , distinctively manifesting itself in tresr spectra .",
    "the analysis also shows that the dissociation of p@xmath9p@xmath17 pairs does not strongly affect the tresr spectra of the system under study at relatively short times @xmath288 ( of main interest in our work ) .",
    "for this reason , in the calculation we have neglected the effect of dissociation . at longer times the contribution of dissociation to tresr spectra becomes important , but , unfortunately , the accuracy of available experimental spectra at these times is not high enough for accurate extraction of the contribution of dissociated pairs to the observed spectra .    at the end of our work",
    "it is worth discussing some recent numerical studies of the processes similar to that studied here . as an example , let us discuss one of the most recent and fairly detailed work , concerning the analysis of tresr spectra of geminate pairs of neutral radicals in micelles.@xcite analysis is carried out within the model , which takes into account the spin evolution , accompanied by relative diffusion .",
    "the tresr spectra , investigated in this work , do not demonstrate the change of the sign of distortions ( of aps and cidep - type ) at long times .",
    "this is , probably , because the radical pairs are created in the triplet spin state .",
    "certainly , the results of the analysis , presented in ref . [ 18 ] , are very interesting and insightful .",
    "unfortunately they can hardly be directly applied to the theoretical investigation of considered spin correlated p@xmath9p@xmath10-pairs in organic solids at low temperatures , first of all because for these systems the diffusion approximation does not seem to be valid , especially taking into consideration strong coulomb interaction between polarons in non - polar organic solids , the effect of which is expected to be very important at low temperatures .",
    "noteworthy is that the direct comparison of parameters of our model with those of model used in the work [ 18 ] is hardly possible .",
    "it worth also adding , that the proposed decomposition of the tresr spectra into the aps and cidep contributions ( [ numepr3 ] ) can not be easily realized in the model proposed in [ 18 ] .",
    "concluding our short discussion we would like to emphasize that in spite of great attention , payed to the interpretation of experimental tresr spectra of particular spin - correlated p@xmath9p@xmath17 pairs , the goal of our treatment is more general .",
    "the main idea is to develop some new combined numerical / theoretical methods of the analysis of these spectra to get some additional insight into the specific features of p@xmath9p@xmath10-spin evolution .",
    "we belive that the proposed analysis is fairly convincing illustrative example of application of the proposed methods ."
