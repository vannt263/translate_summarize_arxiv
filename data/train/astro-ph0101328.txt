    "the possibility that a first generation of objects with masses comparable with those of globular clusters formed prior to galaxies has long been recognised @xcite .",
    "such jeans  mass ( @xmath4 ) objects forming shortly after the decoupling of matter and radiation in the early universe could have evolved to black holes and it is possible that some of the dark matter could be in this , difficult to detect , form @xcite .",
    "building on these ideas gnedin & ostriker @xcite and gnedin , ostriker & rees @xcite explored a cosmogonic model in which the baryonic density ( @xmath5 ) is up to an order of magnitude higher than that inferred from primordial nucleosynthesis with the `` excess '' baryons being lost in the collapse of such jeans  mass objects .",
    "it has also been conjectured that relic massive black holes might provide the seeds for quasars @xcite .",
    "press & gunn @xcite developed the idea of detecting supermassive compact objects ( co ) by their gravitational lensing effects well before the actual discovery of gravitational lenses in 1979 .",
    "they showed that in a universe filled with a mass density @xmath6 , the probability of a distant source being detectably lensed by a supermassive co is of order unity , while for @xmath7 , the probability decreases in direct proportion to the mass density . from this",
    "they drew the important conclusion that the fraction of distant galaxies that is lensed by co directly measures and , ignoring angular resolution effects , is independent of the mass @xmath8 of the lenses .",
    "the latter property is simply understood .",
    "a given value of can be made up of a large number of low ",
    "mass objects or a small number of high  mass ones ; hence the number density @xmath9 of co of a particular mass is proportional to @xmath10 . for point masses the gravitational lensing cross  section @xmath11 @xcite and hence the path length to lensing @xmath12 is independent of the lens mass",
    ". however , the average image separation measures @xmath8 directly and is approximately independent of @xmath13 .",
    "these ideas were further developed by nemiroff @xcite and by nemiroff & bistolas @xcite .    since for a lens at a cosmologically significant distance",
    "the image separation is @xmath14 arcseconds , searching for jeans ",
    "mass co requires the milliarcsec ( mas ) resolution of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "kassiola , kovner & blandford ( @xcite ; hereafter kkb ) , used the lack of `` millilensed '' images in published vlbi maps of 48 compact radio sources , to place an upper limit @xmath15 ( 99.7% confidence ) in the mass range @xmath16@xmath17 m@xmath2 . in a closely  related search nemiroff",
    "@xcite used the lack of secondary `` echoes '' of gamma ray bursts , which would also arise from millilensing , to rule out a closure density of supermassive co. in this paper we describe a millilens search based on high - quality vlbi maps of 300 sources which extends kkb s lower mass range to @xmath18 and enables us to push their limit on for jeans ",
    "mass objects down by a factor 15 .",
    "this is the most stringent limit to date on for uniformly  distributed jeans  mass objects and we discuss some cosmological implications of this result .",
    "the parent sample was drawn from catalogues of compact radio sources which have been systematically observed by the authors with intercontinental vlbi arrays at a frequency of 5 ghz and a resolution @xmath6 mas ; a significant fraction of these sources was also observed at 1.6 ghz .",
    "the catalogues , radio images and full description of the observations can be found in the following papers : the pearson & readhead vlbi survey ( pr ; @xcite ) ; the first caltech  jodrell bank vlbi survey ( cj1 ; @xcite ) ; the second caltech  jodrell bank vlbi survey ( cj2 ; @xcite ) . from these samples",
    "a large sub  set of 300 sources was selected on the basis of a `` flat '' integrated radio spectrum between 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz . in this context",
    "`` flat '' implies a source whose spectral index @xmath19 , where the flux density at a frequency @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "the sample thus selected contains nearly all the strongest flat  spectrum radio sources in the sky above declination @xmath22 .",
    "flat - spectrum radio sources are best  suited to a millilens search because they tend to be dominated by a single compact ( sub  mas ) `` core '' , which originates close to the massive central black hole in the nucleus of the background galaxy .",
    "the presence of _ two _ compact components ( putative images ) then provides a simple diagnostic of gravitational lensing by a point  like mass and genuine images will have well understood , simply  related , properties @xcite .",
    "however great care has to be taken in choosing lens candidates since compact radio sources have a range of intrinsic structures which can confuse the selection process .",
    "guided by a series of simulations we decided only to look for cases of multiple imaging of the compact core .",
    "it is much harder to be certain of recognising lensing effects on lower  brightness emission regions .",
    "we adopted the following quantitative selection criteria based on the gaussian models listed in the original vlbi survey papers :    _ a candidate has to have two or more compact ( @xmath23 1 mas ) components and the secondary component should be smaller than the primary . _ because of the surface  brightness conserving property of lensing , weaker images are smaller images .",
    "however , conservative allowance was made for gaussian model - fitting uncertainties by accepting some candidates in which the secondary had an area up to twice , and in a few cases three times , that of the primary . _",
    "the separation of the primary and secondary components , @xmath24  mas_. this is set by the vlbi resolution and field  of  view limitations and determines the mass range to which the search is sensitive .",
    "the upper limit on the separation was set by the practicalities of map  making at the time the vlbi surveys were made . _",
    "the ratio of the flux densities of the core of the primary component and the secondary component is @xmath25 40:1_. at this level secondaries are detected with high signal  to  noise ratio .",
    "fifty lens candidates were selected of which six could immediately be ruled out from other published vlbi data .",
    "since the brightness contrast between the core and all other emission regions in a radio source increases with increasing frequency , the simplest way to determine whether two or more of the components are compact , and have properties appropriate for lensed images , is to observe at a higher frequency and higher resolution than the original 5 ghz survey maps .",
    "the candidates were therefore all observed at 15 ghz using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "a minority of the candidates were also observed at one or more of the frequencies 1.6 , 8.4 and 22 ghz .",
    "the observations and the radio maps will be described elsewhere .",
    "many of the candidates turned out to be core ",
    "jet sources in which the jet is faint but contains a `` hot  spot '' .",
    "the vlba 15 and 22ghz maps reveal the bright core and resolve the lower - brightness hot - spot .",
    "an example of such a candidate is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the 5 ghz map of 0740 + 768 shows a simple unresolved double source but the higher resolution 22ghz map clearly shows that the compact core lies at the eastern ( left ) end with the other `` jet - like '' emission having markedly lower  brightness .",
    "other candidates turned out to be compact symmetric objects ( csos)an early ( @xmath26 years ) high  luminosity phase of large double radio sources @xcite . at high resolution csos",
    "often show a single central core straddled by a pair of outer `` lobes '' of significantly lower surface brightness ; not only is there no detailed correspondence between sub  structures in the lobes but also their parities are incorrect for lensed images .",
    "( 8.5,8.5)(0,0 ) ( -1.3,-4.6 )    component spectra can also be used to rule out candidates . for lensing on",
    "the present scales the time delay between the light paths ranges from a few seconds to a few hours , which is much shorter than the timescales between sets of vlbi observations .",
    "lensed images must , therefore , brighten and fade together .",
    "a strong corollary is that lensed images must have identical radio spectra or , equivalently , their flux ratio must not be frequency  dependent .",
    "this argument should be used with care if one or both of the components is well resolved but we ruled out candidates with compact components if the flux ratios at different frequencies were inconsistent by @xmath27% .",
    "component motion is also an excellent discriminant . if the lens moves across the line of sight the relative separation of the images will change .",
    "for example a lens at @xmath28 , moving transversely with @xmath29 km s@xmath30 , will produce a relative image motion @xmath31 mas yr@xmath30 .",
    "this is much too small to be measurable with vlbi and thus , if relative motion is detected , the secondary can not be a lensed image . in a separate follow ",
    "up programme for the pr and cj vlbi surveys most of the sources have been observed more than twice over a period of several years @xcite . currently over 30 of our 50 candidates",
    "are known to show component motions greater than @xmath32 mas yr@xmath30 and hence can be ruled out by this means as well .",
    "all 50 candidates were ruled out , often for a combination of the reasons cited above , and we now use this null result to set quantitative limits on supermassive for objects _ uniformly distributed _ throughout the universe .",
    "( 8.5,8.5)(0,0 ) ( -0.6,9.5 )",
    "we used the detection volume method introduced by nemiroff @xcite and developed in detail for the specific case of a vlbi search for point masses by kkb .",
    "we will , therefore , only make a few points specific to our search .",
    "the most important observational limit is the flux ratio @xmath33 which sets the maximum source  lens impact parameter and hence defines the basic detection volume .",
    "the usual definition of `` strong '' lensing @xcite refers to images with a flux ratio of @xmath34 ; our @xmath35 flux ratio therefore corresponds to a configuration with a larger lens  to  source `` impact parameter '' and hence the cross - section for lensing is almost five times that normally assumed for lensing calculations .",
    "each source is observed with an approximately fixed angular resolution and hence minimum image separation @xmath36  mas , and limited field  of  view @xmath37  mas , both of which act to truncate the detection volume . in effect",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 define the lower and upper limits of a mass range for which the truncation is small .",
    "our search is sensitive to the mass range @xmath40 to @xmath41 m@xmath2 . for observations of a number of sources the individual detection volumes for each source",
    "can be summed to give a total detection volume . in the calculation of these volumes",
    "one needs to know the source redshifts and these are available for 270 out of the 300 sources in our sample ; the mean redshift is 1.30 and 20% of the sources have redshifts @xmath42 . for the remaining 30 sources we have assumed a distribution in redshift similar to that exhibited by the other 270 . for the calculation of the angular size distances we took @xmath43 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 and , for direct comparison with kkb s result we assumed an einstein  de sitter universe ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "our null result allows an upper limit to be placed on and figure [ fig2 ] shows the limit at the 95% confidence level as a function of co mass .",
    "the limit is approximately constant from @xmath40 to @xmath41 m@xmath2 and in this mass range @xmath45 .",
    "if was equal to 0.013 the `` expected '' number of lenses in the total detection volume associated with our 300 sources would be three and the fact that none are detected allows us to reject this hypothesis with 95% confidence .",
    "if was equal to 0.026 then @xmath46 lenses would be expected and we can reject this higher mass density with 99.7% confidence .",
    "these limits are conservative because gravitational lensing increases the observed flux density of a background source and hence lensed sources are drawn from a fainter source population than the unlensed sources ; a flux  limited survey will contain more lenses than expected .",
    "our null result therefore corresponds formally to a stronger limit on but the `` magnification bias '' associated with flat spectrum radio sources , especially for lens systems with high flux ratios , is of order unity @xcite and we have therefore ignored this effect .",
    "kkb derived a limit on ( @xmath16@xmath17 m@xmath2 ) @xmath15 ( 99.7% confidence ) ; this corresponds to @xmath47 ( 95% confidence ) . the lower mass limit is larger than ours since they took @xmath48 mas compared with our 1.5 mas .",
    "the upper mass limit derived by kkb is high since it is based on @xmath49  mas which is , in our view , optimistic ; we used @xmath50  mas .",
    "our null result implies @xmath45 ( 95% confidence ) in the mass range @xmath51 to @xmath52m@xmath2 which is about 15 times more stringent than kkb s .",
    "the improvement arises from a combination of more sources ( 300 cf .",
    "48 ) , larger @xmath53 ( @xmath35 cf .",
    "@xmath54 ) and hence larger lensing cross  section and a higher mean redshift for the parent sample ( 1.30 cf .",
    "our result allows the following conclusions to be drawn .",
    "uniformly distributed co in the mass range @xmath40 to @xmath41 m@xmath2 do not make up more than @xmath3 of the closure density @xmath55 which is strongly supported by the latest measurements of the angular spectrum of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "similarly such co do not make up more than @xmath56 of the dark matter density @xmath57 favoured by current observations .",
    "the favoured value of the baryon density from big ",
    "bang nucleosynthesis is @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "taking a plausible value for @xmath59 ( 0.65 ) implies @xmath60 thus our 95% confidence limit implies that uniformly  distributed jeans  mass co do not make up more than about one third of @xmath61 .    a large population of uniformly  distributed @xmath62 m@xmath2 black holes is required by the cosmogonic model developed by gnedin & ostriker @xcite and gnedin , ostriker & rees @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that up to @xmath63 of high redshift sources",
    "should be detectably lensed by such a population there should be up to 15 lenses in our sample .",
    "they are not observed and hence the model can be ruled out .",
    "perhaps the next interesting limit is @xmath64 which would constrain the contribution of supermassive co to be no more than the baryonic contribution of presently observable stars and galaxies . to reach this limit about 1000 sources , with the same redshift distribution as the present sample , would have to be studied ; this would be a time  consuming , but relatively straightforward , task .",

    "_ note added in proof _ : when this work was almost completed we became aware of the millilensing results of nemiroff and collaborators ( preceding pr letter ) using gamma ray bursts .",
