    "the advent of a new generation of large area radio surveys which sample the radio sky down to mjy levels ( e.g. first , becker et al . , 1995 ; nvss , condon et al . , 1998 ;",
    "sumss , bock et al . , 1999 ) has introduced great advantages for both radio astronomy and cosmology . from the cosmological point of view",
    ", the high surface density of sources allows studies of the large - scale structure of the universe and its evolution up to high redshifts ( @xmath15 ) and large physical scales ( see e.g. cress et al . , 1996 ; magliocchetti et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the low flux limits reached , these surveys sample populations of sources , such as star - forming galaxies , where the radio signal is produced by phenomena other than agn activity .",
    "a complete investigation of the nature of radio sources and their properties can only be achieved with multi - wavelength follow - up . in particular optical identifications",
    "enable the acquisition of optical spectra , which can be used to derive their spectral type and redshift distribution ( see e.g. magliocchetti et al . , 2000 - ma2000 hereafter ) .",
    "great effort has recently been made to determine the photometric and spectroscopic properties of radio sources at mjy levels and fainter ( gruppioni et al .",
    ", 1998 ; georgakakis et al . , 1999 ; sadler et al . , 1999 ; ma2000 ; masci et al . ,",
    "these studies have proven extremely useful in characterizing the populations of radio sources , but there are still significant uncertainties .",
    "for instance it has been established that there is starbursting population of radio sources , but there is still some debate about the overall fraction ( see for instance the results from sadler et al . , 1999",
    "as compared with those derived in gruppioni et al . , 1998 ;",
    "georgakakis et al .",
    ", 1999 ; ma2000 ) .",
    "these follow - up studies however suffer from two great limitations : either they survey small areas of the sky and therefore generate relatively small samples of objects , or they lack completeness .",
    "the small number of sources leads to a low confidence level for any result drawn from statistical studies , while radio or optical incompleteness leads to biases in the determination of the redshift distribution of radio sources at such low - flux levels .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of the properties and angular clustering of @xmath16 4100 radio sources brighter than 1  mjy with optical counterparts brighter @xmath17 .",
    "this sample was obtained by matching together objects from the first and apm surveys over @xmath18 square degrees near the celestial equator . despite not having redshift measurements for these sources ,",
    "their joint radio , photometric and morphological properties can be used to infer extremely useful information on their nature .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath19 , we obtain a catalogue of sources which is @xmath20 complete in the optical band ( ma2000 ) and 80% complete in the radio band ( with a completeness level rising to 100% for radio fluxes @xmath21  mjy , becker et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the photometric and morphological properties of the optical identifications are then used to divide the whole sample of radio sources into two well defined populations .",
    "the first population consists of low - redshift radio galaxies and the second one of high - z qso and objects with no counterpart on the ukst plates .",
    "the homogeneity and completeness of the low - z sample allows us to study the clustering properties of these sources .",
    "lastly , the area chosen for our analysis coincides with some of the fields observed in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( maddox 1998 , colless , 1999 ) .",
    "this sample of optical identifications of @xmath16 4100 radio sources therefore provides an excellent starting point for further wide - area spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section 2 briefly describes the two surveys and the data coming from them .",
    "section 3 presents the procedure we adopted to match radio and optical sources together , while section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the photometric properties of the optical identifications .",
    "section 5 examines the clustering properties of the sample and section 6 summarizes our conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ) survey ( becker , white and helfand , 1995 ) began in the spring of 1993 and will eventually cover some 10,000 square degrees of the sky in the north galactic cap and equatorial zones . the beam - size is 5.4  arcsec at 1.4  ghz , with an rms sensitivity of typically 0.15  mjy / beam .",
    "a map is produced for each field and sources are detected using an elliptical gaussian fitting procedure ( white et al . , 1997 ) ; the @xmath25 source detection limit is @xmath26  mjy .",
    "the astrometric reference frame of the maps is accurate to 0.05  arcsec , and individual sources have 90 per cent confidence error circles of radius @xmath27 0.5  arcsec at the 3 mjy level , and 1  arcsec at the survey threshold .",
    "the surface density of objects in the catalogue is @xmath28 per square degree , though this is reduced to @xmath29 per square degree if we combine multi - component sources ( magliocchetti et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the depth , uniformity and angular extent of the survey are excellent attributes for investigating , amongst others , the clustering properties of faint sources .",
    "the catalogue derived from this survey has been estimated to be 95 per cent complete at 2  mjy and 80 per cent complete at 1  mjy ( becker et al . ,  1995 ) .",
    "we used the 5 july 2000 version of the catalogue which contains approximately 722,354 sources from the north and south galactic caps .",
    "this is derived from the 1993 through 2000 observations that cover nearly 7988 square degrees of sky , and includes most of the area @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the apm galaxy survey has been extensively described in maddox et al . , ( 1990a , 1990b , 1996 ) . briefly , it is based on apm scans of @xmath34 ukst plates , covering about 7000 square degrees in the regions dec @xmath35 in the southern galactic cap and @xmath36 dec @xmath37 , @xmath38 dec @xmath39 respectively in the equatorial sgp and ngp . a scan of a typical plate records about 300,000 images , with a limiting magnitude for image detection @xmath40 .",
    "for each image , the measurements show a positional accuracy of @xmath26  arcsec and an isophotal magnitude accuracy of @xmath41  mag .",
    "the photometry from each plate is corrected so that it is consistent with the neighbouring plates , in the way described in maddox et al .",
    "( 1990b ) .",
    "the limit for uniform image detection over the whole survey is set by the shallowest plate , and is found to be @xmath42 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     columns 2 and 3 of table [ table_identifications ] respectively give the total number of radio sources and number of sources with optical identifications ( with @xmath40 ) found in each field .",
    "the total number of sources in the area @xmath43 , @xmath44 with an identified optical counterpart within 2 arcsecs is 4075 , 16.7 per cent of the whole radio sample .",
    "this percentage drops to 13 per cent ( corresponding to 3176 identifications , column 4 of table [ table_identifications ] ) if we include the further constraint @xmath45 , to obtain a uniform sample from the apm survey .    in order to quantify how many matches are likely to be random coincidences",
    ", we ran the matching code once again , after shifting all the radio positions 1 arcmin north .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : allres2 ] .",
    "the positional residuals are uniformly distributed on the @xmath46 @xmath47 plane as expected for random coincidences .",
    "furthermore , we find only 225 sources with offsets within our chosen matching radius of 2 arcsecs , corresponding to @xmath48 per cent of the true matches .",
    "contamination from spurious coincidences at this level is not a problem in our analysis .",
    "note that if we had chosen a matching radius as large as 5 arcsecs , the percentage of random matches would have been 1200/5866 @xmath49 per cent , which would have required a more sophisticated treatment of contamination .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the results obtained by evaluating the expected number of chance coincidences : for 68.7 radio sources per square degree , one in fact respectively obtains 182 and 1139 random matches by considering radii of 2 and 5 arcsecs over the 350 square degrees of analysed area .",
    "we divided the radio sources with optical identifications into galaxies and stellar objects based on the optical classifications described in section 2 .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_identifications ] shows the number of galaxies ( dotted line ) and stellar sources ( solid line ) in the radio subsample with optical identifications ( hereafter called the id - sample ) as a function of @xmath50 magnitude . as expected from the analysis performed in section 2 , the number of sources identified as galaxies rises with increasing magnitude up to @xmath51 , where the optical images become too faint to allow the detection of any extended structure . correspondingly , the number of stellar objects increases beyond its real value for @xmath52 .",
    "again @xmath53 is seen as the faintest magnitude for which we can discriminate between extended images ( radio galaxies ) and stellar images ( mainly qso ) .",
    "the stellar identifications also include a very small number of galactic stars - less than 0.1 per cent of the objects in the first survey are expected to be associated with stars , see helfand et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "columns 5 and 6 of table [ table_identifications ] indicate the number of non - stellar and stellar sources found on each of the ukst plates in our analysis .    a joint analysis of the radio and photometric properties of the id - sample can provide us with extremely useful insights on the nature of the radio sources under examination .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath9 magnitudes are plotted against radio fluxes in figures [ fig : fb ] , [ fig : fr ] , where black dots indicate galaxies and red dots indicate stellar objects .",
    "note that beyond @xmath51 ( corresponding to @xmath9 @xmath54 ) the distinction between galaxies and stars becomes very difficult , therefore all the sources appear in the catalogue as stellar .",
    "the following analysis will therefore only apply to magnitudes @xmath3 .",
    "the radio - to - optical ratio is defined as r@xmath55 @xmath56 , where s is the radio flux in mjy and m is the apparent magnitude ( either @xmath9 or @xmath50 depending on the specific case .",
    "we recall here that a source is considered radio - loud if r@xmath57 @xmath58 ( see e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "it has been shown ( see for instance magliocchetti , celotti & danese , 2001 ) that for star - bursting galaxies , where the star - formation activity is so intense that it hides the signatures of any central bh , r@xmath57 @xmath59 .",
    "thus the small number of sources below the r@xmath57=100 line in figure [ fig : fb ] shows that there are @xmath60 star - forming galaxies in the first sample down to 1 mjy .",
    "this is further confirmation of the result that star - bursting sources show up only at radio fluxes below the mjy level ( see for instance , gruppioni et al . 1998 , georgakakis et al . 1999 and ma2000 ) .",
    "the region of the s-@xmath50 plane between r @xmath61 and r @xmath62 is mainly dominated by sources identified as ( radio ) galaxies , and this population constitutes the majority of the id - sample . for r @xmath63 and @xmath64 stellar identifications , most likely to be high - z qso , dominate the sample .",
    "fainter than @xmath65 this effect is mainly an artefact of the data because the optical images are too faint to resolve galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : fr ] illustrates the flux - magnitude diagram in the @xmath9 band .",
    "apart from the features already seen in figure [ fig : fb ] , we note an interesting shift of the population of radio galaxies towards brighter red magnitudes .",
    "this shift is especially significant for s @xmath58 mjy and is not observed for the stellar identifications , highlighting the fact that radio - galaxies are typically red , early - type objects .",
    "this effect can be seen more clearly in figure [ fig : frb ] , which plots the @xmath4 colour of sources in the id - sample for objects with @xmath50 @xmath66 .",
    "the majority of the id - sample consists of galaxies with very red colours , up to @xmath67 .",
    "this conclusion is actually made even stronger as in our analysis we might have missed very red sources which had @xmath50 magnitudes too faint to be included in the original catalogue .",
    "the id - sample was drawn from a catalogue selected on @xmath50 magnitude ; the red magnitudes were added later as explained in section 2 .",
    "note the clear distinction in figure [ fig : frb ] between radio galaxies , which appear mostly with @xmath68 and qso , which dominate the region @xmath69 .",
    "this division becomes striking for radio fluxes s @xmath70 10 , where the two distributions take the shape of a tuning fork .",
    "again we can see that star - forming galaxies showing blue ( i.e. for @xmath71 ) colours and low ( s @xmath72 ) radio - fluxes constitute only a few tens of objects in the lower part of the plot",
    ".    also when we consider the number of sources per unit of radio flux ( see figure [ fig : hist_flux ] ) we see that stellar and non - stellar ids show different behaviours .",
    "the number of galaxies ( the dashed line ) , shows a steeper slope than the number of qso ( the solid line ) .",
    "this difference reflects the fact that galaxies tend to have lower radio fluxes , while qso dominate the region @xmath73  mjy .",
    "the acquisition of optical identifications for radio sources is not only useful in providing optical information , it also gives the opportunity to make a distinction between low - redshift sources and more distant ones .",
    "passive radio galaxies are known to be reliable standard candles ( see e.g. hine & longair , 1979 ; rixon , wall & benn , 1991 ) . the mean absolute magnitude in the red band",
    "is @xmath74 ( see e.g. ma2000 ) , and there is little scatter about the mean ( ma2000 estimate @xmath75m@xmath76 at the 1@xmath77 level ) .",
    "thus measurements of the apparent magnitude @xmath9 for these sources can provide us with an estimate of their redshifts according to the relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 the luminosity distance .",
    "the id - sample is complete to @xmath80 , and from this formula we expect that objects brighter than @xmath80 should be found in the redshift range @xmath81 .",
    "+ as we saw in the previous section , the optically extended id - sample is mostly made up of early - type galaxies , with star - bursting objects contributing only a small fraction .",
    "so we can apply equation ( [ eq : r ] ) to the whole subsample of radio galaxies , and deduce that it contains radio - sources that are mostly closer than @xmath14 .",
    "the spread in the @xmath82 relation means that the upper redshift limit will be a gradual cutoff ; see also ma2000 .",
    "the other sources that appear in the id - sample are mainly qso with a very small contamination from nearby stars .",
    "unfortunately , we have no simple way to distinguish between these two classes of objects , or to estimate the qso redshift . however , apart from rare exceptions , we expect qso to be all placed at high redshifts , at least beyond z @xmath83 .",
    "+ the optical distinction between point - like and extended sources as discussed in the previous section , allows us to divide the id - sample in a low - z subsample - comprising mostly of early - type galaxies and roughly complete to @xmath14 - and a sample of qso mostly found at redshifts well beyond 0.3 .",
    "figure [ fig : distrib ] shows the angular distribution of these sources projected on the sky .",
    "the bottom panel represents the distribution of all the objects in the id - sample with @xmath84 , limit for completeness and uniformity of the optical catalogue , while the middle one includes radio sources identified as galaxies and the top one is for point - like sources ( both in the case of @xmath85 ) .",
    "we can quantify the level of clustering in each sample by means of the two - point correlation function .",
    "ideally one would like to obtain the spatial correlation function @xmath86 but , since we do not have measured redshifts for any sources in the id - sample , we have to deal with its angular counterpart @xmath12 .",
    "we recall here that the angular two - point correlation function measures the excess probability , with respect to a random poisson distribution , of finding two sources in the solid angles @xmath87 @xmath88 separated by an angle @xmath89 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath90 \\label{eqn : wthetadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the mean number density of objects in the catalogue under consideration .",
    "we calculated @xmath12 using the estimator ( hamilton , 1993 ) @xmath92 where the number of data - data , random - random and data - random pairs separated by an angle @xmath89 are denoted by dd , rr and dr respectively .",
    "+ random catalogues were generated with a spatial distribution modulated by both the apm and first coverage maps , so that the instrumental window functions do not affect the measured clustering .",
    "we estimate the errors on the @xmath12 measurements by assuming the the pair counts follow poisson statistics .",
    "this underestimates the uncertainties , but we do not expect this bias to be a large factor .",
    "however , the errors in @xmath12 at each point are correlated , so it is easy to overestimate the significance of any features apparent in @xmath93 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wall ] we show the results for @xmath12 of the whole id - sample with @xmath84 .",
    "as already stated , error - bars are given by poisson estimates for the catalogue under consideration .",
    "the clustering signal is significantly greater than zero at all angular scales ; if we assume a power - law form for @xmath12 , @xmath94 , we find , via a @xmath95 fit to the data , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "+ however , as we have already seen , the id - sample is a hybrid mixture of low- and high - z sources , which means that this measurement is not particularly relevant .",
    "more interesting information can be derived from the analysis of the clustering signal produced by the two different classes of objects , namely stellar and extended sources .",
    "we then estimated @xmath12 for the stellar - like sources ( 535 objects with @xmath3 ) , and the resulting @xmath98 is shown in figure [ fig : wstars ] .",
    "the clustering signal is dominated by large errors due to the small number of objects .",
    "nevertheless the signal is positive at almost all angular scales up to @xmath99 .",
    "the most interesting result is represented by the angular correlation function for the 1494 radio galaxies in the id - sample .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ fig : wgals ] , in this case the signal is quite strong , showing once again that radio sources are more clustered than normal galaxies ( see also peacock & nicholson , 1991 ; cress et al . , 1996 ; loan , wall & lahav , 1997 ; magliocchetti et al . ,",
    "1998 : magliocchetti et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , if we parameterize @xmath12 as a power - law : @xmath100 , we find - via a @xmath95 fit to the data - @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with a value for the slope close to those obtained for samples of early - type galaxies only , known to be more strongly clustered than other galaxy populations ( see e.g. maddox et al . , 1990c and loveday et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "note that this result also agrees with the observational evidence for agn - fuelled radio sources to be hosted by elliptical / early - type galaxies ( see e.g. mclure et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "+    since this last measurement has been obtained for a homogeneous sample of sources with a fairly well determined redshift distribution , we can predict the clustering for a range of models to be directly compared with the data .",
    "the first step in our model is to calculate the mass - mass correlation function @xmath103 .",
    "we use the analytical form derived using the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) approach , extended to z @xmath104 by matarrese et al .",
    "this starts with a primordial cdm power spectrum ( cobe normalized in our case ; bunn & white , 1997 ) and writes the non - linear part of the power - spectrum @xmath105 as a function of its linear part @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the linear and non - linear wave - number respectively ( see magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2000a ) for a complete derivation of the various quantities ) .",
    "the predicted angular correlation function @xmath109 can then be obtained from @xmath103 using the relativistic limber equation ( peebles , 1980 ) @xmath110 ^ 2 } , \\label{eq : limber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the comoving coordinate , @xmath112 is related to the spatial distance @xmath113 between two sources separated by an angle @xmath89 ( in the small angle approximation ) via @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is the curvature correction ) , @xmath116 is the redshift distribution for the sources under consideration , @xmath117 is the maximum redshift of the sample and @xmath118 is the bias function which determines the way radio sources trace the mass distribution .",
    "note that , by imposing a @xmath117 we have assumed that the sample completeness is a step function , which immediately drops to zero beyond the redshift where the sample starts to become incomplete ( 0.3 in our case ) .",
    "we use the @xmath116 obtained by ma2000 ( fig .",
    "this is based on redshift measurements for 76 radio sources selected from both the first survey and the phoenix survey ( hopkins et al .",
    ", 1998 ; georgakakis et al . , 1999 )",
    "these samples were selected at a limit of 1 mjy and include redshift measurements up to z @xmath119 .",
    "a little more attention has to be devoted to the issue of bias and its evolution .",
    "of the various models presented in literature , the so - called _ merging model _",
    "( mo & white , 1996 ; matarrese et al . , 1997 ; moscardini et al . , 1998 ; martini & weinberg , 2001 ) has the most appealing physical motivation : dark matter halos simply undergo dissipative collapse ( i.e. merging ) .",
    "however this model has been shown to not fit the clustering data at low - redshifts ( see e.g. baugh et al . , 1999 ; magliocchetti et al .",
    ", 1999 ; magliocchetti et al . , 2000a to mention just a few ) .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy may be that the merging rate of objects is very high for z @xmath120 but becomes negligible for z @xmath121 .",
    "+ a better bias model to describe the data in this situation is the so - called _ galaxy conserving model _ ( fry , 1996 ) .",
    "this model assumes that galaxies form at some epoch and then the clustering pattern simply evolves as the galaxies follow the continuity equation without losing their identity .",
    "it can be shown ( nusser & davis , 1994 ; fry , 1996 ) that bias for such galaxies evolves as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the linear growth rate for clustering , and @xmath124 is the bias at the present epoch , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the rms fluctuation amplitude in a sphere of radius 8 h@xmath127mpc .",
    "we calculate @xmath128 assuming a correlation radius @xmath129 h@xmath127mpc for radio galaxies ( peacock & nicholson , 1991 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath130 using a cobe - normalized @xmath131cdm model with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting prediction for @xmath109 is presented in figure [ fig : wgals ] .",
    "the match with the data is extremely good , especially when one considers that there are no free parameters in the model .",
    "this gives us confidence on our understanding of the processes regulating clustering in general and in particular the one of radio sources , at least in the nearby universe .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the properties of optical counterparts of radio sources at the 1 mjy level .",
    "the optical identifications have been obtained by matching together objects from the first and apm surveys over the region of the sky @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "we found 4075 radio objects with fluxes greater than 1  mjy to be identified in the apm catalogue for @xmath40 within a matching radius of 2 arcsecs ( id - sample ) .",
    "this corresponds to 16.7 per cent of the original radio sample .",
    "a cut for @xmath50 = 21.5 has subsequently been applied to ensure a uniform optical sample : 3176 identifications are found brighter than this magnitude limit .",
    "such a wide area sample allows detailed statistical studies on the photometry of radio sources .",
    "furthermore , with the application of the methods introduced in maddox et al . , ( 1990a ) , we managed to divide radio sources with optical identifications and @xmath3 into radio galaxies and stellar objects ( mainly qso with some contamination from nearby stars ) .",
    "we find the population of radio galaxies to be almost exclusively dominated by early - type galaxies , with radio - to - optical ratios in the blue band between @xmath132 and @xmath133 and very red colours ( up to @xmath134 ) .",
    "starbursting objects make up only a negligible fraction of the sample .",
    "qso tend to have @xmath135 and preferentially lie in the region @xmath136 of the colour - radio flux diagram at all radio fluxes .",
    "since passive radio galaxies are known to be reliable standard candles , measurements of the apparent magnitude in the red band allowed us to divide the id - sample into two low - redshift and high - redshift catalogues , the first one - roughly complete to @xmath14 - made by radio galaxies and the second one including high - z qso .    the completeness and homogeneity and defined redshift cut of the galaxy sample allowed a direct comparison between models for the angular correlation function and the data .",
    "we find an extremely good match between observational results and models if we treat radio galaxies as highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and if we assume a bias evolution with look - back time of the form introduced by fry ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results obtained by magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the whole sample of first radio sources .",
    "note that , as well as the results presented in this paper , such a large sample of radio sources with optical identifications forms an excellent basis for spectroscopic follow - up observations , which could , amongst others , fully determine the form of the redshift distribution of these objects at the mjy level out @xmath137 . we will tackle this issue in a future paper where we will present results from the 2df survey .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the properties of optical counterparts of radio sources down to 1  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> optical identifications have been obtained by matching together objects from the apm and first surveys over the region @xmath0 , @xmath1 . selecting radio sources down to 1  mjy , and adopting a uniform optical limit of @xmath2 we find 3176 have a counterpart in the apm catalogue , corresponding to 13 per cent of the radio sample .    for @xmath3 we can divide radio sources into resolved radio galaxies and stellar - like objects ( principally qso ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the population of radio galaxies to be mainly made by early - type galaxies with very red colours ( @xmath4 up to @xmath5 ) and a radio - to - optical ratio @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of starbursting objects is negligible . in general qso show @xmath7 and @xmath8 . on the basis of the @xmath9 magnitudes </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the sample of radio galaxies to be complete up to @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> . we can therefore divide the whole sample of radio sources into a low - z and high - z population . </S>",
    "<S> the low - z one includes the objects identified as galaxies in the apm survey , the high - z one includes sources either identified as qso or with no optical counterpart for @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that radio galaxies are strongly clustered and highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> models for the angular correlation function @xmath12 show good agreement with the observations if we assume a bias factor @xmath13 at @xmath14 .    </S>",
