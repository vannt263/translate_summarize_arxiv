    "recently spin - polarized transport has attracted lots of attention because of its potential applications to spin - electronic devices . magnetic tunnel junction (",
    "mtj),@xcite consisting of two ferromagnetic ( fm ) electrodes with an insulating layer sandwiched in between two , is one exemplary realization of the spin - polarized transport and show a large tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect.@xcite stable mtjs with large tmr are now routinely fabricated .",
    "the tunneling current is modulated by the relative orientation of magnetizations in the two fm electrodes . according to the julliere s model @xcite , the tmr ratio is given by @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the tunnel resistance for the parallel and antiparallel alignment of the mtj , respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron spin polarizations of two fm electrodes .",
    "usually more current flows in the parallel alignment of magnetization such that the tmr is positive .",
    "recently some experimental groups @xcite observed the inverse tmr effect for which more current flows in the antiparallel alignment of magnetizations in two fm electrodes than in the parallel alignment .",
    "the inverse tmr in co / srtio@xmath5/la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath5 is ascribed @xcite to the selective tunneling of @xmath8 electrons of co through the insulating srtio@xmath5 barrier . to investigate the role of the oxide barrier on the sign of tmr , mtjs with various oxide barriers",
    "were studied .",
    "@xcite theoretical studies @xcite elucidated the important role of the surface dos and the electronic wave functions in the barrier in determining the nature of tunneling electrons or the sign of the tmr .",
    "the surface density of states for co and fe near the fermi energy is dominated by the @xmath8-band , and the @xmath9-band in co has the positive ( negative ) spin polarization ( sp ) , respectively.@xcite when the al oxide layer is sandwiched between two co or fe metals , the @xmath10-band electrons relatively easily tunnel through the barrier while the @xmath8 electrons are strongly suppressed in the barrier .",
    "the @xmath10 electrons are mainly responsible for the tunneling leading to the positive sp @xcite . for the barrier of srtio@xmath5 , the opposite is true , leading to the negative tmr or inverse tmr .",
    "the inverse tmr was also observed @xcite when the spin - polarized electrons tunnel resonantly through the impurity states in the barrier .",
    "more current in the antiparallel alignment can flow resonantly through a localized state in the barrier when the impurity is located asymmetrically inside the barrier with respect to two fm electrodes . in this case",
    "the inverse tmr is determined mainly by the structure of the impurity states in the barrier .",
    "the inverse tmr can occur due to the kondo effect when the impurity spin is sandwiched in between two fm electrodes.@xcite the kondo resonance peak can develop even when the magnetic impurity is coupled to the spin - polarized electrons of ferromagnetic metals . in the antiparallel alignment of two fms , the impurity states of spin up and spin down are more symmetrically coupled to the corresponding spin states of conduction electrons than in the parallel alignment . when the coupling constants of both spin states are more or less equal , the whole kondo resonance peak develops at the impurity site.@xcite either in the case of asymmetrical couplings between two fms for the antiparallel configuration or in the parallel configuration , the kondo spin states are split by the exchange field of two fms such that the kondo resonance peak is split into two .",
    "@xcite since the kondo resonant state acts as the electric current channel , more current can flow in the antiparallel alignment than in the parallel alignment , resulting in the negative value of the tmr .",
    "the inverse tmr was indeed observed in the ni - c@xmath11-ni system @xcite in the kondo regime .    in this paper",
    "we propose theoretically another possible mechanism for the inverse tmr , based on the simple model study .",
    "the model system is schematically displayed in fig .",
    "[ model ] , where the spin polarized electrons of one fm electrode pass through a narrow channel into the second fm electrode .",
    "when the transmission probability is small between two fm electrodes , the tmr is normal or positive . on the other hand",
