    "in a series of recent articles we have constructed the functional renormalization group ( frg ) method for disordered systems , applied to specific situations and beyond one loop @xcite .",
    "this method is , apart from mean field theory @xcite using replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) and some rare exactly solvable cases @xcite , the only known analytical method which promises to handle the strong coupling glass phase of disordered elastic systems @xcite .",
    "such systems , modeled by an elastic manifold ( of internal dimension @xmath1 ) with a @xmath0-component displacement field @xmath5 ( i.e.  @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , are of high interest for numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "this so - called random manifold model still offers great theoretical challenges and a strong motivation is the hope to gain insight into glassy physics . in addition , the @xmath8 case maps onto the much studied kardar - parisi - zhang growth equation @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a strong coupling phase for which the upper critical dimension is still under debate @xcite .",
    "higher loop studies of the statics of disordered elastic systems allow , in principle , a systematic dimensional expansion , in the simplest case around @xmath9 .",
    "they are however of a rather different nature than in standard field theory for pure critical systems @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations are found to be formally irrelevant in these glass phases , suggesting that the physics is controlled by a zero temperature fixed point .",
    "however before this fixed point is reached , the zero temperature effective action is found to become non - analytic @xcite .",
    "although this allows to evade the so - called dimensional reduction @xcite which makes naive perturbation theory useless and yields unphysical results , it also generates amazing new subtleties in the field theory .",
    "these were analyzed in a number of papers @xcite , and although some solutions to the puzzles were proposed the physics still remains to be elucidated .",
    "an interesting limit where one can hope to gain insight into these formidable problems is the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "since @xmath2 is formally the mean - field limit , it allows a direct confrontation between the frg method and mean field methods .",
    "a solution of the @xmath10 random manifold model for @xmath2 was proposed by mzard and parisi , using a saddle point with spontaneous replica symmetry breaking @xcite . as in other models of glasses",
    ", spontaneous rsb can be related to ergodicity breaking of the gibbs measure into several ground states @xcite .",
    "although it offers a rather elegant way out of dimensional reduction , it is by no means clear that systems with ( large but ) finite @xmath0 should exhibit such a tremendous degeneracy of low energy states ; and there are in fact indications to the contrary @xcite .",
    "it is thus crucial to develop another line of attack , even in that limit .",
    "this is what we have achieved in a previous publication , where we have computed the effective action of the theory at large @xmath0 .",
    "there we have derived the @xmath4-function of the field theory to dominant order , i.e.  for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we have discovered that beyond the larkin length the frg flow freezes ( at least for specific initial conditions ) and that most of the features of the mzard parisi solution can be recovered .",
    "interestingly however , in this formulation there is no need for a spontaneous rsb ansatz with ultrametric structure .",
    "thus one may hope that it could be more adapted to real world situations than the rsb calculations .",
    "such rsb calculations of fluctuations around the mean - field solution have been attempted for the random - manifold problem only in the case of 1-step non - marginal rsb ( with disappointing result @xcite ) and offer , in full generality , extreme complications , as is illustrated by several studies for spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the next challenge is thus to extend the frg in a large-@xmath0 expansion beyond the dominant order ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper . since this is a complicated calculation , and involves developing new methods which are of interest by themselves , this paper is restricted to the calculation of the effective action and derivation of the @xmath4-function to order @xmath3",
    "this is performed at @xmath11 and at finite temperature .",
    "the analysis of the resulting frg flow , comparison with other studies , and applications , e.g.  to the strong - coupling phase of the kpz equation is involved and is the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ genform ]",

    "section [ results ] contains the full result for the effective action to order @xmath3 , first expressed in bare parameters , then as a function of the renormalized dimensionless disorder .",

    "amounts to shifting its argument , as can be seen from taylor - expansion . in these loops ,",
    "again derivatives ( one needs @xmath116 to attach the loop ) of the effective potential are inserted .",

    "the `` big loop '' ( a loop made of loops , see main text ) accounts for a factor of @xmath3 ; the same is true for the `` minimal loop '' on the right , which is a `` big loop '' in disguise ( as explained in the main text . )",
    "the given diagram is thus of order @xmath118,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ]    take a `` tree '' ( as e.g.  the object on fig .  [ largengen ] ) and glue it together to form a `` big loop '' by identifying two vertices ; this does not change the factor of @xmath0 from the loops , but one looses one factor of @xmath0 from the missing vertex . note that also the `` minimal loop '' marked on figure [ fig1onphi ] belongs to the same class , even though it looks different .",
    "the `` big loop '' demands to sum a series of diagrams at non - vanishing momentum , and then to carry through the integration over momenta .",
    "however the simplification remains that any added `` tree - like '' branches are resummed by replacing the argument of @xmath115 from @xmath108 to @xmath119 .",
    "another feature arises at subdominant order : in the `` big '' loop , one may pick any given small loop ( i.e.  the loop made out of correlation - functions ) and replace one of the two correlation - functions by @xmath108 : this means that the corresponding fields @xmath120 did not get contracted .",
    "since the remaining correlation - functions force their indices to be equal , this gives a factor of @xmath121 , thus contributes the same factor of @xmath0 .",
    "note that these diagrams do not contribute to the effective action at leading order , which is treelike , since the resulting diagrams would be 1-particle reducible .    to resum the order @xmath3-diagrams one has to sum over loops of all sizes .",

    "only diagrams with one `` big '' loop ( general feature of the order @xmath3 discussed in the last section ) made of any number of `` small '' 2-loops and only exactly _ two _ `` small '' 3-loops can contribute to the renormalized second cumulant .",
    "each small 3-loop can also be replaced by an uncontracted @xmath130 . to understand this , consider the simplest `` big '' loop , i.e.the railroad diagram , which is drawn on the left of figure [ f : bigloop ] in splitted replica notation .",
