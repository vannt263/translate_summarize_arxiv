    "although its total mass is only @xmath1 of that of galaxies , interstellar dust plays an important role in the galactic evolution , the formation of stars and planetary systems , and possibly , the origins of life . the physical and chemical nature of interstellar dust is characterized by its composition , size , shape , and structural form .",
    "current major observational information includes the wavelength dependent extinction , scattering ( albedo ) , and polarization curves , the absorption and emission spectra , and the elemental depletions .",
    "the extinction curve is a sharp discriminator of ( dominant ) size ( @xmath2 ) , but a very poor discriminator of composition .",
    "interstellar polarization is not a separate subject but should be treated as part of the extinction data , except that it indicates that some fraction of the interstellar grains are both nonspherical and significantly aligned .",
    "it is the extinction ( absorption ) and emission spectral lines instead of the overall shape of the extinction curve provides the most diagnostic information on the dust composition .",
    "based on the 2175@xmath3 extinction hump and the ubiquitous 3.4@xmath0 c - h stretching mode , 9.7@xmath0 si - o stretching mode , and 18@xmath0 o - si - o bending mode absorption features seen in interstellar regions as well as the elemental depletions , it has now been generally accepted that interstellar grains consist of amorphous silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials ( see li & greenberg 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "however , the spectroscopic absorption / emission profiles are unable to tell what structural forms dust grains may take ; i.e. , no definite conclusion can be drawn yet on the physical relationship between the silicate and carbonaceous grain components . as a matter of fact",
    ", three distinctly different grain morphologies are proposed for the three most common dust models  ( 1 ) in the silicate - graphite model ( and its updated versions ) the bare silicate and graphite grains are assumed to be physically separated ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 [ hereafter mrn ] ; draine & lee 1984 ; siebenmorgen & krgel 1992 ; dwek et al .  1997 ; li & draine 2001 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) ; ( 2 ) in the silicate core - carbonaceous mantle model the silicate grains are assumed to be coated with a layer of carbonaceous materials in the form of organic refractory ( greenberg 1989a ; dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ; li & greenberg 1997 ) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ; jones , duley , & williams 1990 ) ; ( 3 ) in the composite dust model interstellar grains are taken to be fluffy aggregates of small silicates , vacuum , and carbon of various kinds ( amorphous carbon , hac , and organic refractories ; mathis & whiffen 1989 , mathis 1996 ) . assuming reasonable elemental depletions , all dust models are reasonably successful in reproducing the observed interstellar extinction and polarization curves ( mrn ;",

    "1990 ; dwek et al .",
    "1997 ; li & draine 2001 ) except that the composite grains may be too cold and produce too flat a far - ir emissivity to be consistent with the observational data ( draine 1994 ; dwek 1997 ) .    very recently , adamson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that spectropolarimetric studies of the 3.4@xmath0 hydrocarbon and 9.7@xmath0 silicate absorption features would provide a powerful constraint on the dust morphology .",
    "the ubiquitous 9.7@xmath0 silicate absorption feature is often found to be polarized ; some sources also have the 18@xmath0 o - si - o polarization feature detected ( see smith et al .",
    "2000 for a summary ) .",
    "another ubiquitous strong absorption band in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) is the 3.4@xmath0 feature , commonly attributed to the c - h stretching mode in saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 , li & greenberg 2002 for summaries ) .",
    "if , for the very same region , only the 3.4@xmath0 feature or the 9.7@xmath0 feature is polarized while the other is not , one can then conclude that the silicate and carbonaceous dust components are physically separated .",
    "an attempt to measure the polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 absorption feature was recently made by adamson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) toward the galactic center source irs 7 .",
    "they found that this feature was essentially unpolarized .",
    "this appeared to pose a severe challenge to the core - mantle dust model ( see  [ sec : discussion ] for discussions ) .    in this _",
    ", we explore the ir absorption and polarization properties of the silicate core - carbonaceous mantle model with emphasis on the polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 c - h feature . in  [ sec : opct ] we discuss the optical properties of interstellar hydrocarbon dust material . in  [ sec : p2a ] we predict the relative degrees of polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 c - h and 9.7@xmath0 si - o features .",
    "this will allow comparison with future observations and provide a potentially powerful test on the core - mantle dust model . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we compare our model results with the available observational data and discuss its implication . in  [ sec : sum ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the interstellar organic hydrocarbon dust component reveals its presence in the diffuse ism through the 3.4@xmath0 absorption feature . since its first detection in the galactic center sources",
    ", it has now been widely seen in the milky way galaxy and other galaxies ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 for a summary ) .",
    "although it is generally accepted that this feature is due to the c - h stretching mode in saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons , the exact nature of this hydrocarbon material remains uncertain .",
    "nearly two dozen different candidates have been proposed over the past 20 years ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the organic refractory residue , synthesized from uv photoprocessing of interstellar ice mixtures , provides a perfect match , better than any other hydrocarbon analogs , to the observed 3.4@xmath0 band , including the 3.42@xmath0 , 3.48@xmath0 , and 3.51@xmath0 subfeatures ( greenberg et al .",
    "1995 ) .    however , the absorption spectra of organic residues display a strong 3.0@xmath0 o - h feature and a broad 5.510@xmath0 band which are inconsistent with the diffuse ism observations .",
    "we note that these features , largely attributed to the combined features of the o - h , c = o , c - oh , c@xmath4n , c - nh@xmath5 , and nh@xmath5 stretches , bendings , and deformations , will become weaker or even fully absent if the organics are subject to greater uv photoprocessing which will result in photodissociation and depletion of h , o , n elements .",
    "we also note that the organic residue samples presented in greenberg et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were processed at most to a degree resembling one cycle ( from molecular clouds to diffuse clouds ) . according to the cyclic evolutionary dust model",
    ", interstellar grains will undergo @xmath6 cycles before they are consumed by star formation or becomes a part of a comet ( greenberg & li 1999 ) .    with a rather weak 510@xmath0 band and absent in the 3.0@xmath0 o - h feature , the ir spectrum of the organic extract from the murchison meteorite is also very close to the observed 3.4@xmath0 interstellar feature ( pendleton et al .",
    "we therefore adopt the murchison meteorite 2.525@xmath0 transmission spectrum ( cronin & pizzarello 1990 ) to construct the complex refractive index @xmath7 for the interstellar carbonaceous organic material .",
    "let @xmath8 be the mass absorption coefficient at wavelength @xmath9 .",
    "for spherical grains in the rayleigh limit we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dust mass density .",
    "furton , laiho , & witt ( 1999 ) measured @xmath12 for a hac sample with a hydrogen to carbon ratio of @xmath13 considered as `` a viable analog to the true interstellar hac material '' .",
    "most recent measurements by mennella et al .",

    "we take the @xmath26 values measured from the heavily processed organic residue ( jenniskens 1993 ) . for @xmath27 we take @xmath28 and then smoothly add the murchison meteorite @xmath26 to this continuum .",
    "finally , the real part of the index of refraction @xmath29 is calculated from @xmath30 through the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 and @xmath26 are shown in figure [ fig : nk ] for @xmath32 .",
    "to calculate the polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 c - h absorption feature , for simplicity , we consider spheroidal silicate core - carbonaceous organic mantle dust grains .",
    "we consider both _",
    "spheroidal core - mantle grains and _ equal - eccentricity _ spheroids ( both the core and the mantle have the same eccentricity [ i.e. the same shape ] ) .",
    "undoubtedly , real interstellar grains must be more complicated .",
    "since our ability to compute scattering and absorption cross sections for nonspherical particles is extremely limited , we use the confocal and equal - eccentricity spheroidal shapes as a first approximation . the discrete dipole approximation ( draine 1988 )",
    "may be taken to study more complicated shapes .",
    "quantitative differences are expected but this will not affect the conclusion of the paper , i.e. , both the 3.4@xmath0 c - h absorption feature and the 9.7@xmath0 si - o feature are expected to be polarized for nonspherical and aligned core - mantle grains .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the _ core _ semiaxis along and perpendicular to the symmetry axis , respectively ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 be the _ mantle _ semiaxis along and perpendicular to the symmetry axis , respectively ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 be the _ core _ and _ mantle _ eccentricities , respectively ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) be the volume fractions of the _ core _ and the _ mantle _ , respectively . for _ confocal _ spheroids , @xmath37 relates to @xmath38 through @xmath39 .",

    "we take @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in the wavelength of interest here ,",
    "tenth - micron interstellar grains are in the rayleigh limit .",
    "we therefore calculate the absorption cross sections of confocal spheroids using the `` dipole approximation '' ( gilra 1972 ; draine & lee 1984 ) . for equal - eccentricity spheroids",
    "we take the approach of farafonov ( 2001 ) and voshchinnikov & mathis ( 1999 ) .",
    "we adopt the draine & lee ( 1984 ) dielectric functions for silicate dust .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the silicate core and carbonaceous mantle volumes , respectively .",
    "the volume fraction of the carbonaceous mantles @xmath53 $ ] can be estimated from the observed 3.4@xmath0 c - h ( @xmath54 ) and 9.7@xmath0 si - o ( @xmath55 ) optical depths : @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( sandford , pendleton , & allamandola 1995 ) ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mass densities of the silicate ( @xmath60 ) and carbonaceous ( @xmath61 ) dust ; @xmath62 is the 9.7@xmath0 si - o silicate mass absorption coefficient ( draine & lee 1984 ) ; @xmath63 is the 3.4@xmath0 c - h mass absorption coefficient of carbonaceous organic dust ( see  [ sec : opct ] ) .. but we caution that much lower mass densities ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) were adopted in tielens et al .",
    "] however , a much thicker mantle ( @xmath66 ) is required to account for the visual / near - ir interstellar extinction ( li & greenberg 1997 ) .",
    "the mass ratio of carbonaceous organics to silicates in the coma of comet halley , measured _ in situ _ , was approximately 0.5 ( kissel & krueger 1987 ) .",
    "this also points to @xmath66  it is often suggested that cometary dust is of interstellar origin ( greenberg 1982 ) . in dense clouds",
    "thicker organic mantles would be expected ( but the 3.4@xmath0 c - h band strength also changes ; see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "therefore , we will consider 3 cases : @xmath67 .",
    "we consider spheroids with a wide range of elongations . for a given mantle elongation @xmath68",
    ", the elongation of the core @xmath69 is determined from the mantle thickness@xmath70 .",
    "we calculate the 3.4@xmath0 c - h excess extinction @xmath71 and excess polarization @xmath72 , and the 9.7@xmath0 si - o excess extinction @xmath73 and excess polarization @xmath74 as a function of the mantle elongation @xmath68 and mantle thickness . in figure",
    "[ fig : p2a ] we show @xmath75 , the ratio of the 3.4@xmath0 polarization - to - extinction ratio to the 9.7@xmath0 polarization - to - extinction ratio .",
    "it is seen in figure [ fig : p2a ] that for prolate ( both confocal and equal - eccentricity ) grains , the 3.4@xmath0 c - h absorption feature is polarized to a slightly higher degree than the 9.7@xmath0 silicate feature . for oblate grains ,",
    "the degree of polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 feature can be lower in comparison with the 9.7@xmath0 feature , but even the most extreme case considered in this work still has @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the silicate core - carbonaceous organic mantle model predicts a more or less similar degree of polarization for both the 9.7@xmath0 si - o feature and the 3.4@xmath0 c - h feature .",
    "observationally , there exists a correlation between the 9.7@xmath0 silicate and the 3.4@xmath0 c - h hydrocarbon optical depths ( sandford et al .",
    "although this is consistent with the core - mantle model , it does not necessary establish a core - mantle relationship between the silicate and hydrocarbon materials since such a correlation could also be achieved for a proportional distribution of these materials . in ",
    "[ sec : p2a ] we have seen that both the 3.4@xmath0 feature and the 9.7@xmath0 feature are expected to be polarized for aligned , nonspherical silicate core - carbonaceous organic mantle grains . again , a positive detection of the 3.4@xmath0 and 9.7@xmath0 polarization does not necessary approve the core - mantle model , but a positive detection of one feature together with a negative detection of another would be a fatal judgement for the core - mantle model .",
    "attempts to measure the polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 absorption feature ( @xmath77 ) was recently made by adamson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) toward the galactic center source irs 7 .",
    "they found that this feature was essentially unpolarized .",
    "since _ no _ spectropolarimetric observation of the 9.7@xmath0 silicate absorption feature ( @xmath78 ) has yet been carried out for irs 7 , they estimated @xmath78 from the 9.7@xmath0 silicate optical depth @xmath79 , _ assuming _ that the irs 7 silicate feature is polarized to the same degree as the irs 3 ( another galactic center source ) silicate feature ; i.e. , @xmath80 ( observational data for @xmath79 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are available ) .",
    "_ assuming _ the irs 7 aliphatic carbon ( the 3.4@xmath0 carrier ) is aligned to the same degree as the silicate dust , they expected the 3.4@xmath0 polarization to be @xmath83 .",
    "in so doing , they found @xmath84 ( adamson et al .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the aliphatic carbon dust is not in the form of a mantle on the silicate dust as suggested by the silicate core - carbonaceous mantle models .",
    "we note that , to draw this conclusion , two critical assumptions were made : ( 1 ) @xmath80 ; ( 2 ) @xmath85 .",
    "although the 2nd assumption does not seem to significantly deviate from the detailed calculations [ @xmath86 for reasonable dust parameters ; see  [ sec : p2a ] and figure [ fig : p2a ] ] , the 1st assumption is questionable and needs observational support .",
    "we urgently need spectropolarimetric observations of irs 7 in the 9.7@xmath0 region or of irs 3 in the 3.4@xmath0 region .",
    "if we take the most likely dust parameters ( 1 ) @xmath87 oblate oblate shape was shown to provide a better match than any other shapes to the 3.1@xmath0 ice polarization feature ( lee & draine 1985 ) and the 9.7@xmath0 silicate polarization feature ( hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ) toward the becklin - neugebauer object . ] and ( 2 ) @xmath88 ( li & greenberg 1997 ) , our model calculations give @xmath89 ( see figure [ fig : p2a ] ) , we therefore expect an excess polarization @xmath90 for the irs 7 9.7@xmath0 silicate feature , and @xmath91 for the irs 3 3.4@xmath0 c - h feature .",
    "it is worth noting that the absorption features of ices  the `` precursor '' of organic residue ",
    "are seen in polarization in various sources ( see li & greenberg 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "the ice polarization feature toward the becklin - neugebauer object was well fitted by ice - coated grains ( lee & draine 1985 ) , suggesting a core - mantle grain morphology .",
    "the exact nature of the 3.4@xmath0 feature carrier remains a subject of debate ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 , li & greenberg 2002 ) .",
    "the carbonaceous organic refractory proposal recently receives further support from the very recent discovery of a 6.0@xmath0 feature in dense clouds which was attributed to organic refractory by gibb & whittet ( 2002 ) .",
    "they found that its strength is correlated with the 4.62@xmath0 ocn@xmath92 ( `` xcn '' ; schutte & greenberg 1997 ) feature which is considered to be a diagnostic of energetic processing .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether heavily processed organic residue is able to provide a close match to the 5.85@xmath0 and 7.25@xmath0 c - h deformation bending modes seen toward the galactic center source sgr a@xmath93 as well ( chiar et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the 3.4@xmath0 feature consists of three subfeatures at @xmath94 ( 3.385@xmath95 m ) , @xmath96 ( 3.420@xmath0 ) , and @xmath97 ( 3.485@xmath0 ) corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric c - h stretches in ch@xmath98 and ch@xmath5 groups in aliphatic hydrocarbons which must be interacting with other chemical groups .",
    "the amount of carbonaceous material responsible for the 3.4@xmath0 feature is strongly dependent on the nature of the chemical groups attached to the aliphatic carbons .",
    "for example , each carbonyl ( c = o ) group reduces its corresponding c - h stretch strength by a factor of @xmath99 ( wexler 1967 ) .",
    "furthermore , not every carbon is attached to a hydrogen as in saturated compounds ; instead , some form an aromatic structure ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) . the fact that the 3.4@xmath0 absorption is not observed in molecular cloud",
    "may possibly be attributed to dehydrogenation or oxidation ( formation of carbonyl ) of the organic refractory mantle by accretion and photoprocessing in the dense regions ( see greenberg & li 1999 ) ",
    "the former reducing the absolute number of ch stretches , the latter reducing the ch stretch strength by a factor of 10 ( wexler 1967 )  the 3.4@xmath0 feature would be reduced _ per unit mass _ in molecular clouds .    at this moment",
    ", we are not at a position to rule out other dust sources as the interstellar 3.4@xmath0 feature carrier .",
    "this feature has also been detected in a carbon - rich protoplanetary nebula crl 618 ( lequeux & jourdain de muizon 1990 ; chiar et al .",
    "1998 ) with close resemblance to the interstellar feature .",
    "however , after ejection into interstellar space , the survival of this dust in the diffuse ism is questionable ( see draine 1990 ) .",
    "the polarization of the 3.4@xmath0 aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption feature is modelled in terms of the silicate core - organic hydrocarbon mantle interstellar dust model . for aligned , nonspherical core - mantle grains , both the 3.4@xmath0 c - h feature and the 9.7@xmath0 silicate feature",
    "are expected to be polarized , although unlikely to the same degree .",
    "the non - detection of the 3.4@xmath0 polarization in the galactic center source irs 7 itself is not sufficient enough to rule out the core - mantle model due to the lack of spectropolarimetric observation of this source in the 9.7@xmath0 region .",
    "we call for spectropolarimetric observations of the irs 7 9.7@xmath0 band and the irs 3 3.4@xmath0 band",
    ". this will promise a powerful test on the core - mantle dust model .",

    "<S> in the framework of the silicate core - carbonaceous organic mantle interstellar dust model , the bulk of the visual / near - ir extinction and the entire polarization are from nonspherical and aligned core - mantle grains . </S>",
    "<S> the 3.4@xmath0 c - h and 9.7@xmath0 si - o absorption features , respectively arising from the hydrocarbon mantle and the amorphous silicate core , are expected to be polarized to a modestly different degree . </S>",
    "<S> spectropolarimetric observations toward the same lines of sight both in the 3.4@xmath0 region and in the 9.7@xmath0 region would be of great value to test the core - mantle dust model . the fact that the 3.4@xmath0 feature is not polarized along the line of sight toward the galactic center source irs 7 is not yet sufficient to reject the core - mantle model due to the lack of spectropolarimetric observation of this region in the 9.7@xmath0 region . </S>"
