    "in the first part of a series of papers @xcite , we have introduced a nonlinear elastic energy based on certain invariants of the hencky tensor @xmath1 , namely @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath6 is the gradient of deformation , @xmath7 is the right stretch tensor , @xmath1 is the referential ( lagrangian ) logarithmic strain tensor , @xmath16 is the deviatoric part ( the projection onto the traceless tensors ) of the second order tensor @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the frobenius tensor norm ( see section [ auxnot ] for other notations ) .",
    "we have shown that this exponentiated energy expression improves several features of the formulation with respect to mathematical issues regarding well - posedness . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the polyconvexity for this family . in order to set the stage ,",
    "let us briefly recapitulate some useful details .",
    "the considered exponentiated hencky - logarithmic strain type energies are @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the shear ( distortional ) modulus , @xmath3 is the bulk modulus with @xmath4 the first lam constant and @xmath20 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "the immediate importance of the family of free - energy functions is seen by looking at small ( but not infinitesimally small ) strains .",
    "then the exponentiated hencky energy @xmath21 reduces to first order to the classical quadratic hencky energy @xmath22 based on the logarithmic strain tensor @xmath1 : @xmath23 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our renewed interest in the hencky energy is motivated by a recent finding that the hencky energy ( not the logarithmic strain itself ) exhibits a fundamental property . by purely differential geometric reasoning , in forthcoming papers",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) it will be shown that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the canonical left invariant geodesic distance on the lie group @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 denote the corresponding geodesic distances on the lie groups @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ( see @xcite ) .    in the first part @xcite we have summarized the well - known unique features of the quadratic hencky strain energy @xmath31 based exclusively on the natural strain tensor @xmath1 .",
    "the hencky model is definitely one of the most widely used strain energies in the small elastic strain regime @xcite . in @xcite , however , we also pointed out that the quadratic hencky energy has some serious shortcomings .",
    "for example , the quadratic hencky energy is neither rank - one convex nor does it satisfy any suitable coercivity condition .",
    "these points being more or less well - known , it is clear that there can not exist a general mathematical well - posedness result for the quadratic hencky model @xmath31 . of course , in the vicinity of the identity , an existence proof for small loads based on the implicit function theorem will always be possible .",
    "all in all , the status of hencky s quadratic energy is put into doubt .",
    "this state of affairs , on the one hand the preferred use of the quadratic hencky energy and its fundamental property , on the other hand its mathematical shortcomings , motivated our search for a modification of hencky s energy .",
    "our best candidate for now is @xmath10 defined by .",
    "up to moderate strains , for principal stretches @xmath32 , our new exponentiated hencky formulation is de facto as good as the quadratic hencky model @xmath31 and in the large strain region it improves several important features from a mathematical point of view .",
    "moreover , some other properties ( see @xcite ) such as uniqueness in the hydrostatic loading problem @xcite confirm the status of the exponentiated hencky formulation as a useful energy in plane elasto - statics and give a new perspective in three dimensions .",
    "the main features that have been shown in @xcite is that the exponentiated hencky energy satisfies the lh - condition ( rank - one convexity ) in planar elasto - statics , i.e. for @xmath33 . in this paper",
    "we aim to complete this investigation by showing that the planar elasto - static formulation is , in fact , polyconvex and satisfies a coercivity estimate which allows us to show the existence of minimizers .",
    "unfortunately , some aspects of the three - dimensional description remain open , since the formulation is not globally rank - one convex .",
    "a very useful constitutive requirement is ball s fundamental polyconvexity condition @xcite .",
    "a free energy function @xmath34 is called polyconvex if and only if it is expressible in the form @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is convex .",
    "polyconvexity implies weak - lower semicontinuity , quasiconvexity and rank - one convexity and it implies that the homogeneous solution @xmath38 , is always an energy minimizer to its own dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , polyconvexity is the cornerstone notion for a proof of the existence of minimizers by the direct methods of the calculus of variations for energy functions satisfying no polynomial growth conditions , which is the case in nonlinear elasticity since one has the natural requirement @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "polyconvexity is best understood for isotropic energy functions , but it is not restricted to isotropic response .",
    "the polyconvexity condition in the case of space dimension 2 was conclusively discussed by rosakis @xcite and ilhav @xcite , while the case of arbitrary spatial dimension was studied by mielke @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41-dimensional case of the theorem established by ball @xcite has been reconsidered by dacorogna and marcellini @xcite , dacorogna and koshigoe @xcite and dacorogna and marechal @xcite .",
    "it was a long standing open question how to extend the notion of polyconvexity in a meaningful way to anisotropic materials @xcite .",
    "an answer has been provided in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the main result in this paper is that in plane elastostatics the family of energies @xmath10 given by is polyconvex for a suitable choice of parameters @xmath42 ( theorem [ mainth ] ) , satisfies @xmath43-growth coercivity for any @xmath44 , ( theorem [ thuncoe ] ) and therefore allows for a complete existence theory ( theorem [ mainexist ] ) .",
    "this also confirms the status of the quadratic hencky energy as a useful approximation in plane elasto - statics .",
    "moreover , our family of energies admits a unique , stress - free reference configuration @xmath45 , thus @xmath46 is the global minimizer for natural boundary conditions in any dimension .",
    "the sufficiency condition for polyconvexity which we use has been discovered by steigmann @xcite .",
    "eventually , it is based on a polyconvexity criterion of ball @xcite , but it allows one to express polyconvexity directly in terms of the principal isotropic invariants of the right stretch tensor @xmath13 , namely @xmath47 ( see also @xcite ) . as it turns out , in plane elastostatics ,",
    "steigmann s criterion is already hidden in another sufficiency criterion for polyconvexity given earlier by rosakis @xcite .",
    "however , steigmann s criterion is clearly not necessary for polyconvexity ( see section [ acpse ] ) .",
    "let us begin with the remark , that although this article is mainly concerned with the planar ( two - dimensional ) case , we give some of the preliminaries in their more general three - dimensional version .",
    "for @xmath48 we let @xmath49 denote the scalar product on @xmath50 with the associated vector norm @xmath51 .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the set of real @xmath53 second order tensors , written with capital letters . the standard euclidean scalar product on @xmath52",
    "is given by @xmath54 , and thus the frobenius tensor norm is @xmath55 . in the following",
    "we do not adopt any summing convention and we omit the subscript @xmath56 .",
    "the identity tensor on @xmath52 will be denoted by @xmath45 , so that @xmath57 .",
    "we let @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the sets of symmetric and positive definite symmetric tensors respectively and adopt the usual abbreviations of lie - group theory , i.e. @xmath60 is the general linear group , @xmath61 @xmath62 is the group of invertible matrices with positive determinant . the superscript @xmath63 is used to denote transposition , and @xmath64 is the cofactor of @xmath65 .",
    "the set of positive real numbers is denoted by @xmath66 , while @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a bounded domain with lipschitz boundary @xmath69 .",
    "let us consider @xmath34 to be the strain energy density function of an elastic material in which @xmath70 is the deformation gradient from a reference configuration to a configuration in euclidean @xmath41-space ; @xmath34 is measured per unit volume of the reference configuration .",
    "the domain of @xmath71 is @xmath26 .",

    "however , it is known that the monotonicity in the first @xmath123 arguments is not necessary @xcite . since there is no easy way to represent the energy in terms of @xmath124 , we take the detour of the invariant representation . from @xcite",
    "we have the following result based on the interesting observation that the invariants @xmath125 are convex with respect to @xmath70 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively ( see @xcite , page 485 ) .",

    "therefore , it would be more adequate to say that @xmath128 is convex in the sense of busemann , ewald and shephard s definition @xcite , i.e. @xmath102 can be extended to a convex function defined on the convex hull of its domain of definition . ] , and * @xmath128 is a non - decreasing function is differentiable , then this condition means that @xmath131 for all @xmath132 for which the equation @xmath130 has three positive real solutions .",

    "again , a more appropriate notion of convexity for the function @xmath138 on @xmath140 is that of busemann , ewald and shephard @xcite , i.e. that @xmath102 is the restriction to @xmath140 of a real - valued convex function ( in the usual sense ) defined on the convex hull of @xmath140 or , equivalently , that the function @xmath102 can be extended to a convex function defined on the convex hull @xmath142 of @xmath140 . ] , and * @xmath138 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath133 .",
