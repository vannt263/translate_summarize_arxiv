    "the possibility of inducing unusual zero - resistance states and magnetoresistance oscillations by photo - exciting a high mobility gaas / algaas device , with radiation from the microwave and terahertz parts of the electromagnetic wave spectrum,@xcite has recently motivated a broad theoretical examination of the photoexcited steady states of the low dimensional electron system.@xcite    at the present , the observed radiation - induced resistance oscillations are generally attributed to a field dependent scattering at impurities and/or a steady state change in the electronic distribution function , as a result of photoexcitation.@xcite it turns out that in both of these theoretical scenarios , the amplitude of the magnetoresistance oscillations can increase with the radiation intensity , in analogy to the experimental observations .",
    "consequently , the calculated resistivity or conductivity can be made take on negative values at the minima of the oscillatory magnetoresistivity ( or magnetoconductivity ) for sufficiently large radiation intensities.@xcite a path for realizing zero - resistance states from the theoretically - indicated negative resistivity / conductivity under photoexcitation has been provided by andreev et al.,@xcite who suggested that a physical instability of the negative resistivity / conductivity state should transform it into a zero - resistance state , through the development of dissipation - less current domains . in this approach ,",
    "the current domains reconfigure themselves to accommodate changes in the applied current.@xcite    recently , an alternate scenario has been provided by inarrea and platero,@xcite who suggest that a blocking of the final states for scattering , due to an exclusion principle , leads to the zero - resistance states observed in experiment .",
    "although there exist other models , the above mentioned theories seem to constitute the popular approaches for understanding the observed phenomena .",
    "transport studies in a tilted magnetic field have been utilized in the past to establish the effective system - dimensionality in electronic transport . in quasi 2-dimensional electronic systems",
    "( 2des ) , they have also served to separate the relative contributions of spin and orbital effects .",
    "for example , it is known that in an applied magnetic field @xmath4 , when the 2des specimen is tilted at an angle @xmath5 , the period of landau quantization dependent ( orbital ) effects , such as the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect , is determined by the sample - perpendicular magnetic field component @xmath6 . on the other hand , it is also known that spin related phenomena typically depend upon @xmath4 instead of @xmath6 since the spin degree of freedom couples to the total applied magnetic field.@xcite    we examine here the radiation - induced oscillatory resistance in a tilted magnetic field to experimentally confirm the effective dimensionality , and examine the relative influence of the perpendicular and in - plane ( @xmath1 ) components of the applied magnetic field.@xcite this extended report seems timely in light of the recent observation of an anomalous disappearance of radiation - induced zero - resistance states and associated magnetoresistance oscillations under the application of a small ( @xmath7 tesla ) parallel magnetic field on the 2d electron system.@xcite a summary of our tilt field studies appeared in ref . 1 .    briefly , we find that the characteristic field scale , @xmath0 , or equivalently the periodicity ( @xmath8 , of the observed oscillations is determined by @xmath6 , analogous to the characteristics of the 2d shubnikov - de haas effect.@xcite in addition , the applied @xmath1 seems not to quench the observed phenomena to a tilt angle @xmath5 = 80@xmath9 , although the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations and associated zero - resistance states do disappear in the @xmath5 @xmath10 @xmath11 limit .",
    "for these experiments , specimens characterized by @xmath12 and @xmath13 were mounted within a microwave waveguide , and immersed in liquid helium in a low temperature cryostat , within the bore of a superconducting solenoid.@xcite _ in situ _ sample rotation was carried out by fixing the sample on a geared rotatable platform , which could be turned with the aid of a geared shaft that extended outside the cryostat .",
    "the quoted tilt angles , @xmath5 , are the mechanically set values , which could be incremented in units of @xmath14 .",
    "the gear backlash and/or play produces an uncertainty in the orientation of up to @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the actual tilt angle can differ slightly from the preset value .",
    "this difference becomes consequential especially for @xmath16 case , which has therefore been denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "an estimate of the effective tilt angle , @xmath18 , was obtained from the data analysis , and these are also indicated at the appropriate point in the discussion .",
    "the electrical measurements were carried out using standard low frequency _ ac _ lock - in techniques in an oversized condition for the waveguide ( at 63 ghz ) , which implies an indeterminate microwave polarization .",
    "the microwave intensity was preset to an optimal value and remained undisturbed throughout the experiment .",
    "1(a ) shows the low-@xmath4 transport under photoexcitation at 63 ghz with the specimen oriented at zero tilt - angle , i.e. , @xmath5 = 0 , ( see inset fig .",
    "1 ) , such that the sample normal lies parallel to the applied magnetic field , @xmath4 . in all these measurements ,",
    "the axis of propagation of the electromagnetic waves lies parallel to the magnetic field axis , and the electric field of the microwaves lies in the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 .",
    "1(a ) indicates a wide radiation - induced zero - resistance state in @xmath19 about ( 4/5)@xmath0 , and a close approach to vanishing resistance at the next lower-@xmath4 minimum , near ( 4/9)@xmath0 , which follow the series @xmath20)b_{f}$ ] , with @xmath21 = 1,2,3 .... here , @xmath0",
    "= @xmath22 , @xmath23 is an effective mass , @xmath24 is the electron charge , and @xmath25 is the radiation frequency.@xcite    the effect of tilting the specimen with respect to the magnetic field is illustrated in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) .",
    "these figures indicate self - similarity in the oscillatory resistance pattern under tilt , provided that the magnetic field scale is increased appropriately with increasing tilt angle .",
    "such data suggest that the characteristics field scale , @xmath0 , in the absence of tilt , i.e. , @xmath26 , is mapped onto @xmath27 at a finite tilt angle , @xmath5 , reflecting a dependence of the underlying phenomena on @xmath6 = @xmath28 [ see fig .",
    "1(d ) ] . this plot , fig .",
    "1(d ) , exhibits data collapse and confirms that @xmath6 sets the characteristic field @xmath0 and the inverse - magnetic - field periodicity @xmath29 of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations .",
    "the analysis indicated , in addition , a small difference between the preset tilt angle , @xmath5 , and the effective tilt angle , @xmath18 , in the data , which is attributed here to an orientational uncertainty .",
    "thus , we report that for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "although the oscillatory resistance traces show similarity under tilt when plotted versus @xmath6 , there do occur some systematic variations in the data from one tilt angle to another .",
    "for example , a close comparison of figs .",
    "1(a ) - ( c ) indicates a non - monotonic variation in the amplitude of the radiation induced oscillations with increasing tilt angle [ see fig .",
    "in particular , the resistance peak that has been labelled as ( i ) in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(e ) , increases in height in going from fig .",
    "1(a ) to 1(b ) , and then decreases in height from fig .",
    "1(b ) to 1(c ) .",
    "we explain this effect as follows : it turns out that , in experiment , the oscillation peak amplitude initially increases , then saturates , and finally decreases with increasing radiation intensity.@xcite in the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "1 , the radiation intensity at @xmath34 corresponds to an overexcited condition , a regime where the amplitude tends to decrease with increasing intensity .",
    "such an over - excited condition was chosen for the @xmath34 measurement in order to realize a significant photon flux on the 2des even at the highest tilt angles .",
    "thus , as the tilt angle is increased from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , the effective photon flux on the sample decreases , but this leads to a counter - intuitive increase in the peak amplitude with increasing tilt angle [ fig . 1(a ) and 1(b ) ] . upon moving to the higher tilt angle , @xmath37 in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the oscillation peak amplitude ( i ) now decreases because this corresponds to the regime where a decrease in excitation intensity produces also a decrease in the oscillatory resistance amplitude .",
    "the effect of increasing the tilt angle to nearly @xmath11 is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where we have compared the data traces obtained at @xmath34 and @xmath38 , with the @xmath38 data extending to 11.5 tesla , close to the maximum rated magnetic field of the superconducting magnet . here , in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the weak oscillations in the vicinity of @xmath39 tesla and @xmath40 tesla are indicative of the virtual disappearance of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations and associated zero - resistance state in the @xmath41 limit",
    ". note that in this situation , essentially all of the applied magnetic field , @xmath4 , appears as a component , @xmath1 , in the plane of the 2des . here",
    ", the effective tilt angle extracted from the data is @xmath42 .    at the outset",
    ", one tends to attribute such a reduction in the amplitude of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations in the large tilt - angle limit to the vanishing photon flux on the 2des , when the 2des is oriented nearly parallel to the direction of microwave propagation . yet , from the data of fig .",
    "2(b ) , it is difficult to rule out the alternate possibility that it is the application of a large parallel magnetic field , @xmath43 tesla , which plays some unforseen role in the quenching of the oscillations .    to address this point",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "3 , the data traces obtained at @xmath34 and @xmath3 . at @xmath44 , where the data suggest @xmath45 , the @xmath1 provided at the top abscissa of fig .",
    "3(b ) indicates that a large fraction of the applied @xmath4 appears as an in - plane component .",
    "yet , the radiation - induced resistance oscillations continue to be observable at @xmath3 , with just a small reduction in the peak height in comparison to the @xmath34 condition . from these data",
    ", it seems possible to conclude that , for the highest radiation - induced @xmath19 peak and the deepest @xmath19 valley , a parallel magnetic field component that lies between @xmath46 tesla fails to extinguish the typical characteristics .",
    "thus , such data support the hypothesis that the vanishing photon flux is the cause for the disappearance of the radiation - induced oscillatory resistance in the @xmath47 limit in our tilted magnetic field experiments . in comparison",
    ", the amplitude of the oscillations in the 2d sdh effect is not expected to vanish in a similar @xmath47 limit ( see ref .",
    "19 and , for example , fig . 1(d ) and 3(b ) , right inset ) , although the @xmath4 required to realize the associated oscillations becomes tremendously large , in the large tilt angle limit .",
    "here , we relate our observations to the recent report of a strong suppression of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states and associated magnetoresistance oscillations by a small parallel magnetic field , @xmath1.@xcite as evident from figs . 1 - 3 , and especially fig .",
    "3 , our data do not confirm that a modest @xmath1 , @xmath48 t , causes a strong suppression of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states and associated magneto - resistance oscillations .",
    "although there are experimental differences between their two - axes magnet measurements@xcite and our tilt - field measurements , such differences seem unlikely to be the cause for the observed discrepancy .",
    "perhaps , the dissimilarities in observations are rooted in subtle differences in the physical environments between our respective specimens .",
    "for example , in the specimens utilized in ref .",
    "20 , the onset of sdh oscillations moves to higher magnetic fields with increasing @xmath1 . in comparison , the sdh data exhibited in the right inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) seem not to indicate a similar shift of the sdh onset to higher @xmath6 with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the shift of the sdh onset to higher perpendicular @xmath4 in ref .",
    "20 could be a signature of an increase in the landau level broadening in the presence of a parallel magnetic field .",
    "plausibly , such a change in level broadening could then produce a chain reaction , including the observed disappearance of the radiation - induced zero - resistance states and associated resistance oscillations.@xcite yet , in such a scenario , it is not clear why a fifty percent increase in the field for the onset of sdh oscillations leads to the complete disappearance of the radiation - induced effects in ref .",
    ".    it could also be that small differences in the physical environment become especially significant in the highest mobility specimens , and that our lower mobility specimens provide for some stabilization against such perturbations .",
    "further experimental studies appear necessary , however , to obtain further understanding of the observed discrepancy . at the moment",
    ", it appears that the parallel magnetic field component produces a variable response in the photoexcited 2des .",
    "in summary , we have examined the effect of tilting a photoexcited high mobility 2des with respect to the applied magnetic field .",
    "we find that the characteristic field @xmath0 and the inverse - magnetic - field periodicity of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations is determined by the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the 2des [ fig .",
    "1(d ) ] , as is typical for a 2d orbital effect .",
    "in addition , a parallel magnetic field component , @xmath1 in the range @xmath49 t at a tilt angle @xmath50 appears insufficient to quench the observed photoinduced oscillatory magnetoresistance .",
    "yet , the radiation induced resistance oscillation do disappear in the @xmath51 limit , as the effective photon flux on the 2des vanishes .",
