    "phase transitions from fluctuating phases into so - called absorbing states continue to be an important topic of non - equilibrium statistical physics . a prototypical system that exhibits such a non - equilibrium phase transition is the contact process .",
    "it is defined on a @xmath5-dimensional hypercubic lattice with sites that can be either empty ( inactive ) or occupied by a particle ( active ) . as time evolves ,",
    "particles are spontaneously removed at unit rate and created at empty sites at rate @xmath6 , where the so - called birth rate @xmath2 is a control parameter and @xmath7 denotes the actual number of occupied nearest neighbor sites . in the inactive phase ,",
    "where @xmath2 is small , particle removal dominates and the system approaches a so - called absorbing state without particles from where it can not escape .",
    "however , if @xmath2 exceeds a certain threshold @xmath8 , a steady state with a finite density of particles exists on the infinite lattice and the system is said to be in the active phase .",
    "the two phases are separated by a nonequilibrium phase transition at the critical threshold @xmath9 .",
    "this transition is known to belong to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite .    in spite of the progress in the theory of absorbing phase transitions",
    ", there is so far no experiment that reproduces the critical behavior of the transition in a reliable way  @xcite .",
    "although various experiments show signatures of a continuous transition on a qualitative level , none of them was able to reproduce the full set of dp critical exponents quantitatively .",
    "designing and performing such an experiment remains one of the most challenging open problems of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "there are various reasons why experiments of dp are so difficult to perform .",
    "for example , in the contact process the absorbing state is perfectly stable while in realistic situations there is always a small but finite rate for spontaneous creation of activity that washes out the transition .",
    "another possible source of difficulties in many experiments is the presence of _ spatially quenched disorder _ due to inhomogeneities of the system . in the contact process",
    "this type of disorder can be introduced by initially varying the birth rate  @xmath2 from site to site and keeping these variations fixed as time evolves . from the field - theoretic point of view , spatially quenched disorder is a marginal perturbation under renormalization group transformations which entirely changes the critical behavior at the transition  @xcite .",
    "in fact , numerical studies by moreira and dickman  @xcite showed that the critical dynamics of the contact process with quenched disorder evolves on a logarithmic time scale , e.g. , the density of particles decays as @xmath10^{-\\deltabar}$ ] with some exponent @xmath11 .",

    "a two - dimensional square lattice is first diluted by randomly removing lattice sites with probability @xmath0 . after diluting the lattice ,",
    "a contact process runs on the remaining sites according to the usual dynamical rules . the schematic phase diagram of this model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] . for @xmath14 ( no dilution )",
    "the model reduces to the ordinary two - dimensional contact process with a dp phase transition at @xmath15  @xcite . for weak dilution below the percolation threshold of the lattice , @xmath16 , the active phase of the model survives , but the critical birth rate @xmath2 increases with @xmath0 in order to compensate the missing neighbors . for strong dilution beyond the percolation threshold , @xmath17",
    ", the lattice decomposes into many disconnected finite clusters so that a steady state with a positive density of active sites can not exist .",
    "right at the percolation threshold @xmath12 , the active phase survives only on the infinite percolation cluster provided that the birth rate @xmath2 is larger than some threshold @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the active phase is bounded by two different phase transition lines , a curved and a vertical one , denoted by ( a ) and ( b ) in the figure .",

    "although the scaling properties along these transition lines ( a ) and ( b ) are already well understood , the scaling behavior _ at _ the multicritical point ( mcp ) has not been studied so far . at the multicritical point",

    "in this section we briefly review several types of phenomenological scaling laws which are associated with different parts of the phase diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag ] .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the _ clean _ contact process without dilution ( @xmath14 ) is known to exhibit ordinary power law scaling .",
    "this well - established type of scaling assumes that all relevant quantities such as distances , time intervals , the system size as well as order- and control parameters can be multiplied by a factor @xmath19 raised to some power in such a way that the long - range properties of the system close to the transition remain invariant . in the contact process",
    "the order parameter is the density of active sites @xmath20 which depends on the time parameter @xmath21 , the distance from the critical point @xmath22 , and the lateral system size @xmath23 . in the vicinity of the clean transition ( marked by dp in the phase diagram ) , where @xmath24 is small , this order parameter scales under changing lengths by a factor @xmath19 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are certain critical exponents .",
    "scaling forms can be obtained by choosing @xmath19 in such a way that one of the arguments on the r.h.s .",
    "becomes constant .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath28 one gets @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a scaling function . in most cases this scaling function is universal , i.e.",
    ", its functional form is fully given by the universality class to which the phase transition belongs .",
    "the above scaling form implies that the density of active sites measured in an infinite system at criticality decays as @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , approaching the transition the correlation length and the correlation time both diverge algebraically as @xmath33 meaning that both scales are related by @xmath34 .      along the transition line ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] the diluted contact process is known to display an unconventional type of scaling behavior that has been termed as _ activated scaling _ or _",
    "strong disorder scaling _ in the literature .",
    "this type of scaling is characterized by an ultra - slow temporal evolution which depends on @xmath35 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "activated scaling may be interpreted as a limiting case of conventional scaling when the exponent @xmath36 is taken to infinity .",
    "the resulting scaling laws are very similar to the conventional ones , the only difference being that @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath35 and that the exponents may have different values .    in the case of",
    "activated scaling the characteristic length scale still diverges algebraically whereas the correlation time diverges _ exponentially _ as the critical point is approached : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath39 is an exponent analogous to @xmath36 in the conventional case .",
    "this means that time and length scales are no longer related by @xmath40 , instead @xmath41 is related to the _ logarithm _ of @xmath42 through @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "is also denoted as @xmath45 . ]",

    "note that whenever one takes the logarithm of a parameter , it has to be divided by a constant to make the argument dimensionless .",
    "for example , in the scaling form given above , @xmath56 plays the role of an elementary time scale . in a numerical simulation",
    "such a constant is expected to be of order @xmath57 in natural units of monte carlo sweeps .    as shown in a recent paper by vojta and lee  @xcite , activated scaling",
    "is not only valid along line ( a ) but also along the vertical transition line denoted by ( b ) in fig.[fig : phasediag ] . here",
    "the supporting lattice is at the percolation threshold and thus decomposes into many clusters according to a scale - free distribution .",
    "each of these clusters hosts an independent contact process . in the limit @xmath58 a nonzero steady - state density",
    "can only survive on the infinite percolation cluster while finite clusters enter the absorbing state by rare fluctuations and thus do not contribute asymptotically .",
    "since the infinite cluster has a fractal dimension @xmath59 and therefore covers only a vanishing fraction of lattice sites in an infinite system , it does not contribute to the density of active sites @xmath60 .",
    "this means that @xmath60 is dominated by contact processes on finite clusters and hence approaches zero as @xmath21 goes to infinity .",
    "however , this decay is extremely slow since contact processes on larger clusters may have a very long life time .",
    "vojta and lee showed that the transition along line ( b ) obeys activated scaling , i.e. , we can use the same scaling form as for strongly disordered dp , although with a different set of exponents .",
    "vojta and lee also proved that the exponents @xmath61 and @xmath62 on line ( b ) coincide with the usual order parameter and correlation length exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 of isotropic percolation in two dimensions , i.e. , all static features are dictated by the scaling properties of the supporting lattice at the percolation threshold .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of the critical line the steady - state density @xmath65 and the correlation length @xmath41 are scale as @xmath66 moreover , they found that the density of active sites decays as @xmath67^{-\\deltabar}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is again related to the exactly known static exponents and the fractal dimension of isotropic percolation in two dimensions . in the vicinity of the line ( b ) sufficiently far away from the multicritical point one finds a griffiths - like power law decay @xmath69 for @xmath17 and a stretched exponential of the form @xmath70\\ ] ] for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 again denotes the stationary density . here",
    "@xmath5 is the spatial dimension while @xmath73 and @xmath74 are nonuniversal exponents with diverge as @xmath75 .    to summarize , both transition lines ( a ) and ( b ) obey activated scaling , although with different sets of critical exponents , the latter being related to the exactly known exponents of isotropic percolation in two dimensions . however , the physical mechanisms leading to a logarithmic time dependence are very different in both cases .",
    "as pointed out by vojta and lee , this difference is also reflected in the early time behavior of the model . to this end",
    "one considers the dynamics of a contact process starting from a single active site on a diluted lattice . on line ( b ) , where the contact process is locally supercritical , the cloud of active sites first grows linearly with time until it covers its supporting cluster completely .",
    "this cloud then remains in a metastable state until it reaches the absorbing state by a rare fluctuation .",
    "therefore one observes a very fast short - time behavior followed by a logarithmically slow decay .",
    "on line ( a ) , however , the observed initial spreading is much slower .      quenched disorder by dilution",
    "leads to the emergence of a so - called griffiths phase which in the present model is located between the transition line and the horizontal line starting at the clean critical point ( the dashed line in fig.[fig : phasediag ] ) . a griffiths phase is characterized by an algebraic decay of the order parameter with non - universal continuously varying exponents while spatial correlations remain short - ranged .",
    "the algebraic decay can be understood as follows .",
    "consider a compact finite region of the lattice and let @xmath76 be the corresponding number of bonds .",
    "the probability that none of these bonds was removed during the dilution procedure is @xmath77 , hence the probability to find a fully connected region decays exponentially with its size .",
    "since for large regions with typically more than @xmath78 bonds this probability is extremely small , such fully connected islands have been named as _ rare regions _ in the literature . for @xmath79 each rare region",
    "supports a locally supercritical contact process that survives in a metastable active state for a typical time @xmath80 which grows as @xmath81 with @xmath76 , where @xmath82 depends on @xmath83 .",
    "the exponentially diverging life time combined with an exponentially decaying likelihood for rare regions is the origin of the observed non - universal power - law behavior in the griffiths phase .    to see this note that at a given time @xmath21 only those rare regions are still in the metastable active state",
    "whose number of bonds @xmath76 is typically larger than @xmath84 .",
    "summing up their contributions to the particle density weighted by the probability @xmath77 to find such regions , one arrives at an expression proportional to @xmath85 obviously , the continuously varying exponent @xmath86 depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath83 .      in the present work we also test another type of logarithmic scaling which has been discussed in the context of multiscaling .",
    "the theoretical background for this generalized scaling theory is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be sketched as follows .",
    "starting point is to generalize conventional scale transformations @xmath87 in such a way that the critical exponents @xmath88 are replaced by _ continuously varying _ exponents which may depend on the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , the functional form of these exponents is not arbitrary , rather it is restricted by the postulate that @xmath90 can still be interpreted as a scale transformation ( dilatation ) controlled by a scale parameter @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , it is required that two subsequent scale transformations by @xmath91 and @xmath92 are equivalent to a single transformation by the factor @xmath93 , i.e. , scale transformations should obey the group homomorphism @xmath94 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this requirement leads to the partial differential equations @xmath95 = d[\\nu_\\perp(\\delta ,",
    "t , l ) ] = d[\\nu_\\parallel(\\delta , t , l)]=0\\ ] ] with the differential operator @xmath96 these differential equations constrain the possible functional form of the continuously varying critical exponents . since @xmath97 is the generator of generalized scale transformations ,",
    "these partial differential equations tell us that the exponents may vary with the parameters but only in such a way that they are invariant under scale transformations  @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , conventional scaling with constant critical exponents is a possible solution .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are also other non - trivial solutions . for simplicity",
    "let us consider the critical case @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a function of only two parameters .",
    "one possible solution assumes that the exponents and the density are functions of the quotient @xmath100 and that the exponents @xmath101 and @xmath102 are related by @xmath103 in order to verify this solution , note that eq .",
    "( [ sittlerrelation ] ) turns the generator @xmath97 into @xmath104 so that @xmath105 for any function @xmath106 that depends exclusively on @xmath107 .",
    "in addition , the functional form of the order parameter @xmath99 is restricted by the differential equation @xmath108 .",
    "solving these differential equations one arrives at the scaling form @xmath109 \\;=\\ ; \\ln(l / l_0 ) g \\left ( \\frac{\\ln(t / t_0)}{\\ln(l / l_0 ) } \\right ) \\,+\\ ,   h \\left ( \\frac{\\ln(t / t_0)}{\\ln(l / l_0 ) } \\right)\\ ] ] which can be tested numerically by an appropriate data collapse .",
    "again we divided all relevant quantities by constants to make the arguments of the logarithm dimensionless . setting @xmath110 this logarithmic scaling form",
    "was successfully applied to several systems that are believed to exhibit multiscaling , including self - organized critical sandpile models  @xcite , dla - related growth processes  @xcite and experiments in turbulence  @xcite .",

    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , we will consider a _",
    "bond - diluted _ contact process , i.e. , bonds instead of sites are randomly removed with probability @xmath0 .",
    "this type of dilution has the advantage that the percolation threshold of the lattice @xmath113 is known exactly  @xcite .    after removing the bonds , all lattice sites",
    "are initially occupied by a particle .",
    "the model then evolves by random - sequential updates in the same way as the ordinary contact process : for each attempted update one of the particles is randomly selected . with probability @xmath114 this particle",
    "is removed , otherwise one of the four nearest neighboring sites is randomly selected and a new particle is created provided that the target site is empty and the corresponding bond has not been removed during the initial dilution procedure .",
    "each update attempt corresponds to an average time increment of @xmath115 , where @xmath7 is the actual number of active sites .",
    "typical snapshots of a simulation of a single run are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] .",
    "the quantities to be measured are averaged over a large number of runs , each of them with an independent realization of quenched randomness .    as usual ,",
    "the simplest order parameter is the average density of active sites @xmath116 . without dilution ( @xmath14 ) at the dp critical point @xmath9 , this order parameter is known to decay algebraically as @xmath32 on an infinite lattice , where @xmath117 is the corresponding critical exponent . in what follows we study the diluted contact process along the line @xmath3 , where the frozen network of bonds is at the percolation threshold .",
    "the static exponent @xmath61 can be estimated by measuring the stationary density of active sites close to the transition . however , keeping @xmath3 fixed and varying @xmath2 one finds that the stationary density of active sites @xmath65 is always zero , even on line ( b ) , where the contact process is locally supercritical .",
    "this is because the only surviving subprocess at the percolation threshold is the one running on the infinite percolation cluster while all other subprocesses on _ finite _ clusters have a finite ( although sometimes very long ) life time .",

    "as the fractal dimension @xmath118 of critical isotropic percolation is close to @xmath119 these finite - size corrections are enormous , e.g. on a lattice of @xmath120 sites the largest cluster typically occupies about @xmath121 of the lattice .    to circumvent this problem , we study the density of active sites on the _ maximal _ cluster ( which in a simulation approximates the infinite one ) . to this end",
