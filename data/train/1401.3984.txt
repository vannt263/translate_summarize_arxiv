    "we derive light - cone sum rules ( lcsrs ) for the electromagnetic nucleon form factors including next - to - leading - order corrections for the contribution of twist - three and twist - four operators and a consistent treatment of nucleon mass corrections .",
    "the soft feynman contributions are calculated in terms of small transverse distance quantities using dispersion relations and duality .",
    "the form factors are expressed in terms of nucleon wave functions at small transverse separations ( das ) , without any additional parameters .",
    "the distribution amplitudes can be extracted from experimental data on form factors and compared to the results of lattice qcd simulations .",
    "a self - consistent picture emerges , with the three valence quarks carrying @xmath0 of the proton momentum .",
    "our work can be split into three essential parts : ( i ) calculations within lcsr ; ( ii ) derivation of the factorized amplitude at the leading order ( lo ) up to twist-6 and at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) up to twist-4 .",
    "we calculated 22 coefficient functions at nlo and 20 of them are new ones . to avoid mixing with the so - called evanescent operators , we use the renormalization procedure for operators with open dirac indices ; ( iii ) study of the corresponding distribution amplitudes .",

    "further , making use of the borel transformation @xmath22 , one obtains the following sum rules : @xmath23 the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be written as a sum : @xmath26 each of the functions has a perturbative expansion which we write as @xmath27 and similar for @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the renormalization scale . for consistency with our nlo calculation , we rewrite our results in a different form , expanding all kinematic factors in powers of @xmath30 .",

    "in conclusion , our calculation incorporates the following new elements as compared to previous studies : ( i ) nlo qcd corrections to the contributions of twist - three and twist - four das ; ( ii ) the exact account of `` kinematic '' contributions to the nucleon das of twist - four and twist - five induced by lower geometric twist operators ( wandzura - wilczek terms ) ; ( iii ) the light - cone expansion to twist - four accuracy of the three - quark matrix elements with generic quark positions ; ( iv ) a new calculation of twist - five off - light cone contributions ; ( v ) a more general model for the leading - twist da , including contributions of second - order polynomials .",
