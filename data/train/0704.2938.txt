    ". the accelerated rate at which such systems have been discovered of late suggests the prospects are bright for transit - search projects , as well as for the possibility of critically testing physical models of hot jupiters in the near future based on statistically significant ensemble properties of transiting planet systems ( for a review see  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the accurate determination of the physical properties of transiting exoplanets depends critically upon our knowledge of a number of basic parameters of the parent stars .",
    "in particular , the mass and radius of a planet , which are of fundamental importance for testing theoretical predictions of planetary structure ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite . for a review",
    "see for example  @xcite  @xcite and  @xcite  @xcite , and references therein ) , depend rather directly on the mass and radius of the parent star , placing strict demands on the accuracy of the latter .",
    "evidence for correlations between transiting planet properties and stellar characteristics such as metallicity ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , and their implications for competing giant planet formation models ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , relies in turn on the accurate determination of chemical abundances of the host stars .",
    "attempts to constrain the amount of mass loss experienced by hot and very - hot jupiters ( @xcite  @xcite ) , to refine our knowledge of their relative frequencies ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) as well as to compare observations with theoretical evaporation rates of insolated giant planets ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) are severely affected by large uncertainties in the determination of stellar ages , which can become pathological for field stars , depending on spectral type .",
    "finally , the accurate determination of parent star parameters requires particular attention in cases in which a direct distance estimate to the system ( trigonometric parallax ) is unavailable . for about 2/3 of the presently known nearby transiting systems ( @xmath13 pc ) , and for over 3/4 of the full sample , such measurements are not available at the present time , and will only be made possible by future high - precision astrometric observatories , both on the ground and in space ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite , and references therein ) .    among the recently discovered transiting extrasolar planets , ( @xcite  @xcite )",
    "is the first detected in the field of view of the _ kepler _ mission ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "it has the largest impact parameter , and is the most massive planet , among the currently known nearby transiting systems ( @xcite  @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we report on a detailed spectroscopic determination of the properties of the parent star of , including the effective temperature and surface gravity , as well as the chemical abundances of iron and lithium .",
    "we also measure the chromospheric activity and provide constraints on the age of the system from this and other indicators . because of the importance of the effective temperature for deriving other stellar characteristics , we have made an effort to provide several external checks on its accuracy .",
    "we then use these properties along with other constraints from the light curve analysis of holman et al .",
    "@xcite to infer the mass and radius of the star with realistic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , we show how the use of the _ stellar density _ obtained directly from the light curve fit is in this case a much better proxy for luminosity than the spectroscopic surface gravity , typically used in cases such as this in which the parallax is unknown . our new stellar parameters in turn lead to improved values for the mass and radius of the planet over those reported by odonovan et al .",
    "we conclude by providing a summary of our results and by revisiting some of the evidence connecting the properties of close - in extrasolar planets to the characteristics of their parent stars .",
    "the spectroscopic observations used here are the same as described previously by odonovan et al .",
    "briefly , they consist of twelve echelle spectra obtained with the hires spectrograph on the keck  1 telescope ( @xcite  @xcite ) during the summer of 2006 , with a nominal resolving power @xmath14 .",
    "eleven of these spectra were obtained with an i@xmath15 cell placed in front of the slit to provide a wavelength fiducial for high - precision velocity determinations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) , with typical exposure times of 15 min resulting in an average @xmath16 pixel@xmath17 . one additional spectrum was obtained without the cell for use as a template .",
    "the effective wavelength coverage provided by the three - ccd array of hires is @xmath1832008800 .",
    "additionally we used 5 echelle spectra obtained with the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometers ( @xcite  @xcite ) , which cover 45centered at 5187  at a resolving power @xmath19 , and have @xmath20 ratios ranging from 10 to 15 per resolution element .",
    "a detailed analysis of the template spectrum obtained with the keck telescope was carried out following the same procedures described in detail by sozzetti et al .",
    "( @xcite ,  @xcite , and references therein ) in order to determine the effective temperature ( @xmath21 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath4 ) , and iron abundance [ fe / h ] of .",
    "a set of 30 relatively weak lines of and 4 of were selected , and equivalent widths ( ews ) were measured using the splot task in iraf .",
    "metal abundances are derived under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , using the 2002 version of the spectral synthesis code moog ( @xcite  @xcite ) , a grid of kurucz atlas plane - parallel model stellar atmospheres ( @xcite  @xcite ) , and imposing excitation and ionization equilibrium .",
    "we obtained @xmath22  k , @xmath23 , @xmath24 km s@xmath17 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainties in the first three parameters were estimated following the prescriptions of neuforge & magain  @xcite and gonzalez & vanture  @xcite , and were rounded off to the nearest 25  k in @xmath3 , 0.1 dex in @xmath4 , and 0.05 km s@xmath17 in @xmath26 . for [ fe / h ]",
    "the uncertainty given corresponds to the scatter obtained from the lines rather than the formal error of the mean , since we consider the latter to be unrealistically small in this case .",
    "no significant departures from lte are expected for a star with the temperature and metallicity of ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) , so for the purpose of this study we have not included non - lte effects in our spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we also quantified the sensitivity of our iron abundance determination to variations of @xmath27 with respect to the nominal @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath26 values , and found changes in [ fe / h ] of at most 0.06 dex , below the adopted uncertainty of 0.1 dex .",
    "finally , we determined also the projected rotational velocity as @xmath28 km s@xmath17 , based on the synthesis of a set of unblended lines , following gonzalez  @xcite .",
    "the new values for the stellar parameters are consistent with the spectral type implied by the colors ( @xcite  @xcite ) , and are in generally good agreement with those presented by those authors .",
    "we note , however , that our @xmath3 value is somewhat lower , possibly due to the fact that odonovan et al .",
    "@xcite assumed solar metallicity in their study , whereas our analysis indicates a slightly metal - deficient composition .",
    "given the importance of the temperature determination for establishing the absolute mass and radius of the parent star of , we present in this section a number of other consistency checks that illustrate the reliability and accuracy of our estimate above .",
    "cross - correlation of our cfa spectra against a large library of synthetic templates in the manner described by odonovan et al .",
    "@xcite provides an independent estimate of the photospheric properties of the star . by testing all combinations of the four main parameters of these templates ( @xmath3 , @xmath29 , metallicity",
    "[ m / h ] , and @xmath30 ) we seek to maximize the correlation averaged over the 5 available spectra . in principle",
    "this allows the determination of the four parameters , although in practice the narrow wavelength coverage of only 45  results in strong correlations between some of those properties .",
    "we therefore determined the first two of these quantities along with @xmath30 for fixed metallicities of [ m / h ] = 0.0 ( solar ) and [ m / h ] @xmath31 , which bracket our determination in ",
    "[ sec : atmospheric ] , and then interpolated to [ m / h ] @xmath32 .",
    "the results are @xmath33  k , @xmath34 , and @xmath35  km s@xmath17 , which supersede the values given by odonovan et al .",
    "@xcite that were based on a preliminary analysis .",
    "the temperature is only 60  k lower than our determination in  [ sec : atmospheric ] , well within the errors .",
    "there is also excellent agreement in @xmath4 and @xmath30 .      among the many diagnostics available for effective temperature estimation , the ratio of the depths of two spectral lines having different sensitivity to temperature is among the most powerful .",
    "indeed , the line - depth ratio ( ldr ) technique allows the measurement of temperature _ differences _ of the order of a few kelvin in favorable cases ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , a much higher accuracy than currently possible with other methods that seek to determine temperatures on an absolute scale .",
    "the latter typically have uncertainties of at least 50100  k. absolute temperature determinations with the ldr method still require translation to an absolute scale , usually through color / temperature calibrations since the ldr measurements are typically calibrated first against color indices , which are directly observable .    in order to provide a further check of our spectroscopic @xmath3 determination , we selected in our keck template spectrum 9 pairs of temperature - sensitive lines from the list of biazzo et al .",
    "@xcite in the red part of the spectrum ( @xmath366280 ) .",
    "these authors provide calibrations between ldrs and temperature for a range of rotational velocities ( those for zero rotation were adopted here ) , which include corrections for surface gravity and are valid in the range 3800  k  @xmath37  k. metallicity effects are negligible for stars near the solar abundance ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) . the absolute temperatures derived in this way",
    "rely implicitly on an intermediate calibration between the @xmath38 color and @xmath3 adopted from gray  @xcite . in order to provide consistency with the calibrations we use below , we have converted each of our 9 temperature estimates back into @xmath38 and then into temperature again adopting the calibrations by ramrez & melndez  @xcite , which have been compared carefully against absolute temperature determinations using the infrared flux method .",
    "the average temperature we obtain in this way is @xmath39  k , in agreement with our estimates above .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the wings of the h@xmath40 line profile to temperature variations , as well as the relatively weak sensitivity to changes in surface gravity and metal abundance , make this feature a very useful temperature indicator for solar - type dwarfs ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the core of the line , however , is formed higher up in the atmosphere under conditions that violate lte , so is not useful here . as an additional consistency check on @xmath3",
    "we therefore compared the h@xmath40 line profile outside of the core in our keck template spectrum against synthetic profiles for solar - metallicity dwarfs ( [ m / h ] = 0.0 , @xmath41 ) from the kurucz database . in figure  [ halpha ]",
    "we show the normalized flux in a 10    region centered on h@xmath40 , and four calculated profiles for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "temperatures significantly hotter than 6000  k or significantly cooler than 5750  k appear inconsistent with the observed profile , and suggest the optimal value is somewhere in between . because of the difficulties in the placement of the continuum for such a broad line in an echelle spectrum , we view this comparison only as a rough check .",
    "nevertheless , it agrees once again with our previous estimates .",
    "photometric measurements for are available in the johnson , cousins , _ tycho _ , and 2mass systems , as listed by odonovan et al .",
    "@xcite . based on these data and assuming zero reddening we have computed 7 different color indices ( not all completely independent of each other ) and applied the calibrations of ramrez & melndez  @xcite for a fixed metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath32 to obtain effective temperatures .",
    "there is excellent agreement between these estimates , and the average @xmath3 is @xmath42  k. this is 170  k cooler than our spectroscopic determination in ",
    "[ sec : atmospheric ] , a difference that is significantly larger than allowed by the combined uncertainties .",
    "however , in view of the distance to the object of @xmath18230  pc ( @xcite  @xcite ; see also below ) , a small amount of reddening would not be entirely unexpected , and was also suspected by those authors .",
    "we find that if we applied a correction to the individual color indices corresponding to @xmath43  mag , the average temperature would agree exactly with our spectroscopic value .",
    "indirect support for this amount of interstellar material is provided by the reddening maps of burstein & heiles  @xcite and schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite , which indicate total @xmath44 values along the line of sight to of @xmath180.05  mag and @xmath180.07  mag , respectively .",
    "for the distance of and using the drimmel & spergel  @xcite model of galactic dust distribution these numbers are reduced to @xmath45 and 0.03  mag , respectively .",
    "further support is given by the comparison between the observed colors and those predicted from stellar evolution models described below , which gives @xmath46 .    from the good agreement between our spectroscopic temperature determination in ",
    "[ sec : atmospheric ] and the estimates from the cfa spectra and the ldrs we conclude that the @xmath3 of is accurately established and we make use of it in  [ sec : physics ] to infer the mass and radius of the star .",
    "age determination for individual stars in the field is a difficult task .",
    "a variety of indicators is available , such as h@xmath40 emission , x - ray activity , lithium abundance , h & k emission , asteroseismology , rotation , and galactic space motion , some more constraining than others depending on the particular case . while the relative agreement among multiple methods allows in principle for fairly reliable dating of stars with ages comparable to the age of the hyades or younger , constraints on ages for individual stars with @xmath47 gyr are usually quite weak .",
    "here we have used the activity indicator and the lithium abundance as measured in our hires spectra of in an attempt to inform the theoretical models used for the determination of the stellar mass and radius ( see next section ) .    in the top panel of figure  [ cali ]",
    "we show a region of the hires template spectrum centered on the h line .",
    "no significant emission feature is present , and the same is true for the other keck spectra we collected using the i@xmath15 cell ( in which the iodine lines do not interfere because there are none shortward of @xmath185000 ) . following the procedure outlined in sozzetti et al .",
    "@xcite , we have measured the chromospheric activity index s ( e.g. , duncan et al .",
    "1991 ) from the h and k lines in our spectra , and then converted it into the chromospheric emission ratio @xmath48 , corrected for the photospheric contribution . for , the mount wilson index , averaged over all our spectra , is @xmath49 , and the resulting @xmath50 ( with formal uncertainties calculated from the scatter of individual measurements ) , suggesting a quite inactive star .",
    "the resulting chromospheric age estimate , using the relations summarized in wright et al .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath51 gyr .",
    "we point out , however , that this estimate should not be taken at face value for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , it has been shown ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) that chromospheric activity can only be considered a reliable age estimator up to @xmath52 gyr , and that for stars showing low activity levels the ages derived are only lower limits . secondly , because stars have activity cycles like the sun , the proper measure of the chromospheric flux to use in determining the age of an individual star is an average over the entire magnetic cycle rather than a quasi - instantaneous value such as is available to us , to avoid the possibility of finding a star in a maunder minimum phase ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , there are hints ( @xcite  @xcite ) that chromospheric age estimates tend to be systematically older than those derived with other methods , suggesting perhaps the need for re - calibration of the activity - based ages .",
    "therefore , all we can claim here is that the lower limit for the chromospheric age of is a few gyr .    displays a significant li  @xmath536707.8 absorption feature .",
    "we have carried out a detailed spectral synthesis of a 10    region of the keck template spectrum centered on this line , using the atmospheric parameters derived from the fe - line analysis and the line list of reddy et al .  @xcite . in the bottom panel of figure  [ cali ]",
    "we show the comparison of the spectrum of with three synthetic spectra , each differing only in the li abundance assumed .",
    "the best - fit model results in an abundance of @xmath54 . as shown in figure  [ licomp ]",
    ", the li abundance we obtain does not appear out of the ordinary in relation to those of other planet host stars of similar temperature , as measured by israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ( once typical uncertainties of the order of 50 - 100 k on the @xmath3 determinations are considered ) . by comparison with li abundance curves as a function of effective temperature for clusters of different ages ( @xcite  @xcite ) we infer for an age of about 12 gyr . this value would point to a somewhat younger age than the one inferred from the measurements .",
    "however , it is not uncommon to observe a large spread in li abundance among stars in the same cluster that appear otherwise identical ( @xcite  @xcite ) , so also in this case it seems safer to simply report a lower limit to the age of of 12 gyr .",
    ", as well as the apparent discrepancy between the youth indicators .",
    "the measurement of statistically significant trends of element abundance with condensation temperature @xmath55 ( e.g. , sozzetti et al .",
    "2006 ; gonzalez 2005 , 2006 , and references therein ) or detection of the @xmath56li isotope ( e.g. , israelian et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; gonzalez 2006 , and references therein ) in the atmosphere of tres-2 would be strong evidence in support of the self - enrichment scenario for this star .",
    "further spectroscopic measurements of tres-2 are thus clearly encouraged ]    finally , another argument for the star not being particularly young is given by the small projected rotational velocity we measure here ( see  [ sec : atmospheric ] and  [ sec : cfa ] ) .",
    "this would indicate once again an age of @xmath47 gyr ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "a common procedure for deriving the absolute mass and radius of planet host stars , needed to infer those of the transiting object , is to compare the measured stellar properties such as temperature and luminosity with stellar evolution models in the h - r diagram , or in some equivalent parameter space .",
    "because the distance to is not precisely known ( it was not observed during the _ hipparcos _ mission ) , we do not have direct access to its luminosity .",
    "an alternative measure of intrinsic brightness ( or evolution ) that has been used in the past is the spectroscopically determined value of @xmath4 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "surface gravities are typically very difficult to determine accurately in this way , and as a result the constraint on the stellar radius is relatively weak . here we explore in detail the possibility of using other information available in transiting systems such as , that provide much tighter constraints on the luminosity , as also noted recently by pont et al .",
    "we focus in particular on the quantities obtainable by fitting the transit light curves .",
    "the three main adjustable parameters ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) are often taken to be the relative radius of the planet ( @xmath57 ) , the impact parameter ( @xmath58 ) , and the normalized separation between the star and the planet ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath59 is the semimajor axis of the relative orbit and @xmath60 is the inclination to the line of sight .",
    "these are largely independent of the stellar properties , except for a weak dependence on the limb - darkening coefficients ( a second - order effect ) that are typically a function of effective temperature , surface gravity , and composition .",
    "one of these , @xmath5 , contains information intrinsic to the star : using kepler s third law ( as revised by newton ) it can be shown that @xmath61 ( see also  @xcite  @xcite ) where all quantities are expressed in _",
    "cgs _ units and @xmath62 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "the left - hand side corresponds essentially to the stellar density , @xmath63 .",
    "note that the first term on the right is entirely determined from measurable quantities : the orbital period ( @xmath64 days ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , and @xmath5 from the light curve fit .",
    "the second term on the right , on the other hand , involves the planetary mass ( which is unknown until the stellar mass is determined ) as well as @xmath65 ( also unknown ) .",
    "however , the size of this second term is typically two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the first for most transiting exoplanets including , so it can safely be ignored for all practical purposes .",
    "thus the density of the star is determined _ directly _ from the observations , with no additional assumptions . in this particular case",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath5 determination ( @xmath66 ;  @xcite  @xcite ) is very high : the uncertainty is only 1.6% .",
    "the stellar density is a sensitive measure of evolution or luminosity , and as such it provides a very useful constraint on the size of the star .",
    "we use it along with the effective temperature and the measured metallicity to establish the absolute mass and radius of .",
    "we proceed by comparing @xmath63 ( or a closely related quantity ; see below ) and @xmath3 with current stellar evolution models from the yonsei - yale series by yi et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "we explored the agreement with model isochrones calculated over a wide a range of uniformly spaced ages ( 0.19 gyr ) spanning the full range of metallicities allowed by our spectroscopic determination ( [ fe / h ] @xmath67 ) . along each isochrone we computed the theoretical stellar properties using a fine step in mass , and at each of these points we compared those properties with the observations , and recorded all cases yielding a match within the observational errors . in this way we established the range of permitted values of the stellar mass and radius .",
    "all these matching models were assigned the same likelihood for this application . in practice ,",
    "we have chosen to compare the models with the observations directly in the observational plane ( @xmath5 versus @xmath3 , rather than @xmath63 versus @xmath3 ) . therefore , instead of computing the stellar density along the isochrones and comparing it with the measured value of @xmath63 , we computed the theoretical values of @xmath5 ( which is essentially the cube root of the density ) from an expression obtained by rearranging eq .",

    "the uncertainties listed reflect the spread allowed by the observational errors in @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and [ fe / h ] , and exclude any systematics in the models themselves , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "the surface gravity of the star for the best fit is @xmath73 , in excellent agreement with our spectroscopically measured value in  [ sec : atmospheric ] , and the corresponding metal abundance for this best fit is [ fe / h ] @xmath74 , also virtually the same as the measured value .",
    "the models indicate for the star an age similar to the sun , which is entirely consistent with the lower limits discussed earlier based on the activity indicators and li .    the absolute visual magnitude predicted by the models for the adopted mass and age and our measured composition is @xmath75 , and",
    "the color expected is @xmath76 .",
    "the latter , compared with the measured index of @xmath77 ( odonovan et al .",
    "2006 ) suggests a small amount of reddening of @xmath78 mag , not inconsistent with several other estimates discussed in  [",
    "sec : photometry ] .",

    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : iso ] , where the top panel shows yonsei - yale isochrones for ages of 1  gyr to 9  gyr and a heavy element abundance equal to the measured value of [ fe / h ] .",

    "the surface gravity of the planet follows immediately as : @xmath101 ^ 2\\right ) + 2 \\log\\left({a / r_\\star \\over r_p / r_\\star}\\right ) + { 1\\over 2}\\log\\left(1-e^2\\right)~.\\ ] ] the numerical constant is such that the gravity is in _ cgs _ units when @xmath89 and @xmath97 are expressed in their usual units of days and m  s@xmath17 . for we obtain @xmath102 , in which the uncertainty includes all contributions from measured quantities .",
    "we call the reader s attention to the very high precision of this determination , which rivals that of the best - known double - lined eclipsing binaries ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "while the planetary masses and radii in transiting systems have typically been the main focus of investigators in this field , and with good reason , those quantities depend critically on the mass and radius of the parent star , which are often the weak link in the chain and usually rely on stellar evolution models .",
    "surface gravities are much closer to the observations , are model - independent , and can often be obtained with very high precision as in the case of . accurately determined surface gravities of planets are potentially important for constraining theoretical calculations of the spectra of extrasolar planets .",
    "these have now begun to be tested through infrared photometry of the secondary eclipses as well as transmission spectroscopy in several cases ( see for example  @xcite  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "our high - resolution , high-@xmath20 spectra from keck / hires have allowed us to derive new and accurate values of the stellar atmospheric parameters of the parent star of the transiting planet , principally the effective temperature and metallicity , which have in turn yielded improved parameters for the star .",
    "the g0v main - sequence dwarf appears to have a metal abundance very similar to the average of the solar neighborhood ( [ fe / h]@xmath103 , see for example  @xcite  @xcite ) , making it nominally the most metal - deficient case in the current sample of transiting planets ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the reliability of our temperature estimate is strongly supported by the results of several independent checks we have carried out ( some more constraining than others ) , all of which are in good agreement ( additional spectroscopy , line depth ratios , and h@xmath40 line profiles ) . the old age ( similar to the sun ) we infer for",
    "is also supported by results from the measurements of the activity level , the lithium abundance , and rotation , which rule out a very young age for the system .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that the planet s inferred mass escape rate ( @xmath104 g s@xmath17 , using the model of  @xcite  @xcite ) is not very high .",
    "the inferred lifetime ( tens of gyr , well outside the evaporation - forbidden region indicated by lecavelier des etangs  @xcite ) is long enough that very efficient evaporation scenarios ( @xcite  @xcite ) are not likely to hold in the case of the system .",
    "we have shown that the best constraint on the radius of the parent star comes not from the spectroscopically determined surface gravity ( the quantity most often used for this purpose when a trigonometric parallax is unavailable ) , but from the photometrically determined quantity @xmath5 , which is closely related to the stellar density .",
    "this quantity is directly measured from the transit light curve , and depends only very weakly ( or in some cases , not at all ) on any assumed stellar properties . in this particular case",
    "the gain from using this new constraint is about a factor of five in terms of the precision in @xmath65 .",
    "similar arguments for using @xmath5 instead of @xmath4 were made by pont et al .",
    "@xcite regarding the faint parent star of the transiting planet ogle - tr-10b , although they appear not to have actually applied the method in arriving at the mass and radius of the star reported in their work . with the significant improvements seen recently in the quality of the light curves of several of the known transiting planets ( @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) , the measured @xmath5 values are likely to be much better now than in the original discovery papers .",
    "thus , it may pay to revisit the determination of stellar parameters of many of these systems along the lines of what we have done here , since this should result in significant improvements in the absolute mass and radius estimates of the attending exoplanets as well .",
    "such a study is underway by a subset of the present authors .    our improved stellar parameters yielding more precise values for",
    "the planet mass and radius confirm that is the most massive among the currently known nearby ( @xmath11 pc ) transiting hot jupiters .",
    "although the surface gravity of transiting planets , @xmath105 , has not usually attracted much attention , we point out here that the little - used quadratic relation between the mass and radius of a transiting planet allows the determination of this property of the object purely from observations , free from assumptions about the mass and radius of the parent star .",
    "the high accuracy with which @xmath106 can be determined in and other cases makes it a potentially useful constraint to theory .    among the fourteen extrasolar giant planets known to transit their parent stars , seems to belong to an increasing family of objects ( hd  209458b , hat - p-1b , wasp-1b ) whose measured radii apparently disagree with published theoretical models , in that they are larger than expected . in the past , this anomaly was explained invoking a source of internal heat ( e.g. ,  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite",
    "@xcite ) , either through eccentricity pumping by more distant companions or through persisting obliquity tides . however , these scenarios have some difficulties ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "more recent work",
    "( @xcite  @xcite ) indicates that the discrepancy may be due instead to super - solar metallicities and opacities that naturally retain internal heat , thus helping to keep a hot jupiter s radius larger for longer times .",
    "the smaller - than - expected radii of other transiting planets ( e.g. , hd  149026b ) can instead be explained by the presence of dense rocky cores , and a correlation has been proposed between inner core masses and host star metallicities ( @xcite  @xcite ;  @xcite  @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "the very small inferred core mass for ( @xcite  @xcite ) agrees well with the lower - than - solar iron abundance measured for the parent star .    considering the rapidly growing sample of transiting giant planet systems as an ensemble , other suggestive , albeit preliminary",
    ", trends between different planet and/or stellar properties have begun to emerge from the data .",
    "some are easier to explain within the context of the present theoretical framework , while others still await explanation .",
    "for example , the apparent trend ( with two outliers ) seen in figure  [ corr ] , left panel , of increasing planet radius with increasing mass of the parent star could be due in part to the fact that close - in planets orbiting more massive stars are more strongly irradiated ( @xcite  @xcite ) . on the other hand , the trend of decreasing planet mass with increasing orbital period ( figure  [ corr ] , right panel ) , first highlighted by mazeh et al .",
    "@xcite , appears to be less well understood .",
    "we note , however , that in this case the fact that the host sample is composed of relatively bright , nearby dwarfs targeted by wide - field transit surveys as well as fainter , more distant ogle targets may play some role ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "the above relations suggest there is a strong interplay between planet properties and host star characteristics , which is hardly unexpected , but it is also clear that the parameter space of properties to be investigated is quite large .",
    "observations of transiting planet systems can best inform structural and evolutionary models when they yield accurate determinations of both planet and stellar properties , through high - precision photometric as well as spectroscopic measurements such as those presented here for the system .",
