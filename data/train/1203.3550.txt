    "the intense interest in the physics of graphene , over the last few years , derives in large part from the exceptional electronic properties of the pristine material .",
    "@xcite while pristine samples obtained by exfoliation of graphite have allowed exploration of a rich variety of phenomena connected with the dirac - fermion nature of the electronic excitations in graphene , current large - scale synthesis protocols have reached the point where polycrystalline or highly - inhomogeneous samples are being produced .",
    "@xcite in very recent experiments , graphene layers resulting from reduction of graphene oxide show conductivities that are 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of pristine graphene ,  @xcite possibly due to residual dopants and intrinsic defects .",
    "better conductivities can be obtained when partially oxidized graphene is used as a precursor .",
    "@xcite    from the perspective of applications , widespread use of graphene will depend on the control and understanding of the properties of such defective graphene products .",
    "the atomic structure of defects in reduced graphene oxide ( rgo ) has been recently investigated through high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem )  @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "@xcite the experimental results show significant areas with holes , grain boundaries , isolated pentagon - heptagon pairs and clusters of carbon pentagons , hexagons , heptagons and a few octagons .",
    "similar defect morphologies can be generated in exfoliated graphene by electron - beam irradiation ,  @xcite and by irradiation under extreme temperatures .",
    "@xcite the occurrence of areas with high density of extended topological defects ( etd ) observed in the samples of ref .",
    "5 was attributed to the process of oxidation and further reduction of the graphene oxide , since such large defective areas do not appear in mechanically exfoliated graphene from the same graphite source . moreover , in these samples residual functional groups were found to concentrate primarily on regions with etds , surrounded by pristine ( unfunctionalized ) graphene areas .    given this current interest in defective graphene systems , in the present work , we employ _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to study the morphological evolution of the following graphene structures : ( i ) homogeneously - strained graphene sheets containing a stone - wales ( sw ) defect ;  @xcite and ( ii ) pristine and functionalized graphene sheets containing initial distributions of isolated topological defects ( td ) ,  @xcite after introduction of holes and highly inhomogeneous bond deformations .",
    "we find that stress - relaxation of a graphene sheet containing sw defects may lead to the formation of etds , with morphological units that are very similar to those observed in the aforementioned experiments .",
    "@xcite we uncover the role of the sw defect as a stress - accumulation site that induces the bond rotation events which generate the etds .",
    "furthermore , we find that healing of small voids coupled with the relaxation of inhomogeneously strained regions also lead to the formation of etds , revealing a rich variety of morphological patterns and plastic deformation mechanisms in pure and functionalized graphene structures .",
    "our results indicate that the marked tendency of graphene to form td clusters under strain is aided by functional groups , since the formation energies of such defective structures are considerable smaller in graphane ( a graphene sheet fully functionalized with hydrogen atoms ) and in graphenol ( a graphene sheet fully functionalized with hydroxyl groups ) than in graphene , in agreement with the experimental evidence in ref .",
    "our calculations are performed using kohn - sham density functional theory ,  @xcite the generalized - gradient approximation @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional , and norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials ,  @xcite to describe the electron - ion interactions .",
    "we use the lcao method implemented in the siesta code ,  @xcite with a double - zeta pseudo - atomic basis set augmented with polarization orbitals , with an energy cutoff of 0.01 ry .",
    "full structural optimization of atomic positions and supercell vectors is performed . for the relaxed structures the total force on each atom is less than 0.02  ev /   and the pressure on the supercell is less than 1  kbar .",

    "sw defects are commonly found in graphene and nanotubes , and can be generated by irradiating the material with an 80 kev electronic beam , just below the knock - on threshold for @xmath1 bonded carbon materials .",

    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) ] that transforms four hexagons of the pristine graphene matrix into a sw defect .",
    "since a sw is an incipient dislocation dipole in graphene ( each pentagon - heptagon pair is one of two dislocations with opposite burgers vectors comprising the sw defect ) , at first sight one expects shear deformations either to undo the c - c bond rotation and thus lead to self - annihilation of the two pentagon - heptagon pairs , or to lead to dissociation of the dislocation pair into its individual components .    in order to investigate this , we consider the two graphene supercells , each containing a sw defect , shown in fig.[fig1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "they differ by the orientation of the sw with respect to the @xmath3 and @xmath0 axes of the cell ( indicated in the figure ) .",
    "we find that a 30% shear strain of the supercell shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) leads to the formation of the etd shown in figs .",

    "[ fig1](c ) is obtained by allowing the system to fully relax all the internal atomic coordinates , while maintaining the imposed homogeneous strain .",

    "these results highlight a fundamental aspect of the plastic response of a graphene sheet to imposed stresses or strains : a tendency for the formation of extended topological defects as a stress - relaxation mechanism , spawned by bond rotation events , in the above example with the formation of clusters of fivefold and eightfold rings .",
    "we note also that the transformation depends on the orientation of the shear deformation with respect to the preexisting sw defect , that acts as stress - accumulation seed for the topological transformation .",
    "the location of the defect is at the top , along the center of the cell , in the regions with higher elastic - energy histogram bars .",

    "( c ) relaxation of bulk and defect strain in the stress - free metastable structure .",
    "most of the residual strain is located on the defect.,title=\"fig:\",width=8 ] +    the latter point can be illustrated by following the evolution of the elastic energy of the cell during the deformation , as shown in fig .",

    "@xcite figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the elastic energy for the initial strained geometry .",
    "note that , in this configuration , the strain energy is distributed nearly uniformly over the whole system , with a larger magnitude at the sw defect .",
    "this pattern is preserved up to the point where a morphological transformation takes place .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the strain energy right after the transformation : the important feature here is that a change in the distribution of the elastic energy takes place , from nearly uniform before the transformation to a pattern where the energy is concentrated on the ensuing etd , and where the bulk portion of the cell relaxes to a configuration of much smaller elastic strain .",
    "relaxation of internal atomic coordinates , after the transformation , leads to further reduction of the strain in the cell . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) the imposed homogeneous strain is lifted and the system relaxes to a stress - free state , where the elastic energy in the bulk portions of the cell nearly vanishes , and most of the residual strain is located on the defect .",
    "+    we consider now more complex deformations of a graphene sheet , including small sized holes generated by partially ripping a graphene sheet , coupled with strongly inhomogeneous bond deformations .",
    "these can be considered a model for severely strained and ripped graphene samples , such as those obtained by reduction of go .",
    "@xcite in the following , we show that healing of such graphene fragments , combined with relaxation of the inhomogeneous deformations , also lead to the formation of etds , in some cases with morphologies similar to those that have been observed in recent experiments .",
    "we start with the supercell shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig3](d ) .",
    "this etd is similar in extent to those resulting from the 555 - 777 and 585 reconstructions of a divacancy in graphene .",
    "@xcite      in order to further investigate the morphologies of deformed graphene , and to access the role of functionalization and preexisting topological defects , we choose as starting configurations the three topological - defect graphene networks  @xcite shown on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which were labelled @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ref .  18 .",
    "we also consider the graphane  @xcite ( hydrogen - functionalized ) and graphenol ( hydroxyl - functionalized ) versions of these structures , both at full coverage , with graphenol taken as a simple model for graphene oxide .",
    "@xcite a variety of deformation patterns , including small holes , as well as compressed and/or elongated bonds were initially imposed on these structures , and each system was allowed to relax ( with optimization of both atomic coordinates and supercell vectors ) onto a stress - free metastable local minimum of the total - energy surface .",
    "+    figure  [ fig4 ] shows starting configurations before and after introduction of holes and inhomogeneous compressions , and the resulting relaxed etd configuration . in our calculations , these are , respectively , the lowest - energy etd for each of the following three cases : ( a ) pristine graphene , ( b ) graphane , and ( c ) graphenol . the two functionalized cases in figs .",
