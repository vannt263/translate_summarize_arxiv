    "in models with one universal extra dimension ( ued )  @xcite , all of the standard model particles are promoted to 5 dimensional fields , propagating in a flat extra dimension ( for earlier ideas closely related to ued models see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to allow for the existence of chiral zero - mode fermions , the extra dimension is modded out by the orbifold , @xmath2 . due to the @xmath3 symmetry ,",
    "the interactions between kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes respect what is known as kk - parity , which implies that kaluza - klein particles can only be produced or destroyed in pairs . among other consequences",
    ", this leads to a lower bound on the kk mass scale of only @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kk - parity guarantees the stability of the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) , thus providing us with a potentially viable dark matter candidate . for a review of the ued model and its phenomenology , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite its minimal field content , the ued model contains a large number of undetermined parameters .",
    "in addition to the higgs mass , @xmath5 , and the compactification radius , @xmath6 , the geometry also allows for operators of the 5d fields at the orbifold fixed points whose magnitudes are independent of the bulk parameters ( conservation of kk - parity forces the boundary localized operators to be included symmetrically on both fixed points , however ) . in the absence of such boundary localized terms ,",
    "one expects the first kk excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath0 , to be the lkp  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of such terms , however , can affect the kk mass spectrum  @xcite , and allow for other states to potentially serve as the lkp .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first kk excitation of the neutral @xmath7 gauge boson , @xmath1 , can be the lkp if small but non - vanishing boundary kinetic terms in the electroweak sector are considered .",
    "other identities for the lkp are more difficult to realize .",
    "the first kk excitation of the higgs boson , @xmath8 , could be the lkp , but would require large boundary localized terms and is strongly constrained for low @xmath8 masses  @xcite .",
    "no experimentally viable realizations are known in which the lkp takes the form of a kk - pseudoscalar higgs or kk - neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis that dark matter takes the form of stable , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , is gradually being tested by direct and indirect detection experiments . at present ,",
    "the strongest direct detection constraints on the spin - independent scattering cross section of wimps off nuclei have been placed by the cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite collaborations ( the dama collaboration has also reported an annual modulation of their rate which they interpret as a positive detection of dark matter  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , wimps can produce potentially observable particles in their annihilations .",
    "wimps which scatter with nuclei in the sun can be captured and accumulate in the center of sun , where they ultimately annihilate to produce high energy neutrinos that can be observed with large volume neutrino telescopes , such as icecube  @xcite . assuming that the time scale for the annihilation and capture rates to equilibrate in the sun is smaller than the age of the solar system , the present annihilation rate of wimps will be determined only by the capture rate of wimps which , in turn , can be determined by the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section  @xcite",
    ". therefore both direct detection experiments and neutrino telescopes are sensitive to similar elastic scattering processes .    in this article , we study the impact of these indirect and direct detection constraints on the ued parameter space for lkps in the form of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the phenomenology of a @xmath0 lkp has been studied extensively  @xcite , including the prospects for direct  @xcite and indirect detection  @xcite .",
    "the analysis for detecting @xmath0 dark matter via high energy neutrinos from wimp annihilation in the sun was first performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we closely follow in this article .",
    "the thermal relic abundance of a @xmath1 lkp , and the related constraints from direct detection experiments , have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite which , to the best of our knowledge , is the only study to consider this dark matter candidate ( for discussion of dark matter phenomenology in models with two universal extra dimensions , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we apply the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to the cases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 dark matter . in each case , the lkps scatter off nucleons through the @xmath9-channel exchange of kk - fermions .",
    "the experimental limits from direct detection experiments and icecube lead to strong constraints on the @xmath10 plane , where @xmath11 is the lkp mass and @xmath12 is the fractional splitting between the lkp mass and that of the kk - quarks .",
    "the constraints that derive from cdms and xenon lead to limits on the wimp - nucleon spin - independent cross sections , while those from icecube primarily lead to bounds on the wimp - nucleon spin - dependent cross sections .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin - independent dark matter - nuclei elastic scattering cross section is given by _",
    "si = ^2 , [ dmsisigma ] where @xmath11 is the wimp mass , @xmath13 is the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath14 is the number of protons in the nucleus , and @xmath15 is the number of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the wimp - nucleon couplings , @xmath16 , can be written in terms of the couplings to individual quarks : f_p , n = _ q = u , d , s m_p , n f_t_q^p , n , [ fpn ] where @xmath17 are the respective neutron and proton mass , and the nucleon matrix elements are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have conservatively neglected the couplings to gluons through heavy quark loops . the quark - level couplings for a @xmath0 lkp are given ( in the limit of small mixing between left- and right - handed kk - fermions and small splittings between the kk - fermions mass and the lkp mass ) by  @xcite _ q ( + ) or , for a @xmath1 lkp , by _ q ( ) where r_q_l , r , [ rqdef ] @xmath23 is the electric charge , @xmath24 is the weinberg angle , @xmath25 are the appropriate hypercharges , and @xmath26 are the left- and right - handed kk - quark masses . from this",
    ", it is evident that the scattering cross section is greatly enhanced in the case of small mass splittings .",
    "although direct detection experiments are currently most sensitive to spin - independent scattering , spin - dependent scattering can in many cases dominate the capture rate of wimps in the sun . within the context of ued , in particular , spin - dependent scattering",
    "typically dominate this process .",
    "this is , in particular , true for the dark matter candidates considered in this article .",
    "the spin dependent scattering off protons ( _ ie . _",
    "hydrogen nuclei ) arises from the @xmath9-channel exchange of kk - quarks and is given by  @xcite ^h_sd , b^(1)&=&(4^p_u+ ^p_d+^p_s)^2 + & & 1.7 10 ^ -6 pb ( ) ^4 ( ) ^2 , + ^h_sd , w^3(1)&=&(^p_u+ ^p_d+^p_s)^2 [ esxw ] + & & 0.36 10 ^ -6 pb ( ) ^4 ( ) ^2 , [ esxb ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 quantify the spin - content of the quarks within the proton  @xcite . as only left - handed quarks couple to @xmath1 , @xmath30 depends only on @xmath31 . for @xmath0 , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 contribute , but the cross section is dominated by @xmath33 due to the larger @xmath34 charges of right - handed fermions . therefore in eq .",
    "( [ esxb ] ) we neglect the @xmath32 contributions . in addition",
    "we would also like to emphasize that for @xmath30 the spin - content is given by @xmath35 , where as for @xmath36 it is of @xmath37 .",
    "thus despite the fact that the @xmath38 appearing in @xmath30 is about twice as large as the @xmath39 in @xmath36 , @xmath30 is suppressed relative to @xmath36 .",
    "using the scattering cross sections described in the previous section , we can estimate the rate at which lkps will be captured in the sun . assuming a local dark matter density of 0.3 gev/@xmath40 , the rate of wimps captured in the sun is given by  @xcite c_(3.35 10 ^ 18 s^-1 ) ( ) ^3 ( ) ( ) ^2 where @xmath41 is the local rms velocity of the dark matter halo distribution and @xmath42 is the effective elastic scattering cross section , given by @xmath43 in this expression , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the relative degree of form factor suppression , solar abundances , and kinematic suppression for the various species of nuclei .",
    "these factors are evaluated for the case of hydrogen and helium nuclei in the lower expression .",
    "spin - independent scattering with oxygen nuclei can also be important and may even dominate over spin - independent scattering with other nuclei for sufficiently heavy wimps . any spin - independent scattering cross section that is not already excluded by direct detection experiments , however , will generate an unobservably small flux of high energy neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus throughout the remainder of this article on wimp capture in the sun through spin - dependent scattering , which is far less stringently constrained .    for the range of masses , elastic scattering cross sections , and annihilation cross sections we consider in this paper",
    ", we have explicitly checked that the processes of dark matter capture and annihilation in the sun reach equilibrium  @xcite . in all cases shown , the rate of wimps annihilating in the sun is very close to the rate of wimps captured .",
    "this is in contrast to wimp capture and annihilation in the earth , which does not reach equlibrium in the amount of time available  @xcite .    to calculate the flux of neutrinos from the sun",

    "<S> in models with one universal extra dimension ( ued ) , the first kaluza - klein excitations of the hypercharge gauge boson , @xmath0 , and the neutral component of isospin gauge boson , @xmath1 , are each viable dark matter candidates . in either case , such particles are predicted to accumulate in the core of the sun , where they annihilate to generate a potentially observable flux of high energy neutrinos . in this article , we calculate the flux of neutrinos produced in this model and determine the constraints that can be placed on the ued parameter space from current icecube data . for the case of @xmath0 dark matter , we find that the present limits from icecube are stronger than those from direct dark matter detection experiments such as cdms and xenon10 . for @xmath1 dark matter , </S>",
    "<S> the present icecube data provides a constraint slightly weaker than direct detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also present the projected regions of ued parameter space that can be probed by icecube / deepcore in the near future and compare them to the prospects for future direct detection experiments . </S>"
