    "one of the most basic boundary conditions in electromagnetic theory concerns the interface between two different materials . as propagating waves",
    "traverse the boundary they are reflected and refracted with different amplitudes .",
    "this occurs specifically because the tangential electric and magnetic fields across the boundary are conserved .",
    "one way to interpret this physical behaviour is that by maintaining the continuity of the tangential fields across a material boundary one can subsequently alter and control the propagation of electromagnetic fields in a region .",
    "this fact forms the basis for engineering and designing many electromagnetic and optical devices , including waveguides , lenses and scatterers .",
    "+   + because this idea is so fundamental to electromagnetic theory , the continuity of the fields across interfaces is often taken for granted .",
    "however it is worth asking a simple question .",
    "what if instead of using material interfaces , and thus continuous fields , to engineer desired wave propagation effects we could somehow impose discontinuities in the field , and thereby alter the propagation and amplitude of the wave . in this scenario ,",
    "a desired discontinuity in the electromagnetic field is introduced across a boundary by purposely engineering the boundary itself . here , we are building on work done in @xcite where we introduced a discontinuous field at a boundary to cloak an object .",
    "we now seek to generalize this idea by exploring in more detail how such boundaries are realized , and how can they be used to alter and control the electromagnetic field in a variety of scenarios . +   + specifically , we approach this problem by proposing a general way to impose a discontinuity using currents at an interface .",
    "these currents will act like a huygens source which radiates the desired wavefront to create the discontinuity in the electromagnetic field .",
    "we first propose two ways to implement our discontinuity , one active and one passive .",
    "using the active method we synthesize some novel cloaking examples building on our previously developed cloaking approach in @xcite . with the passive method",
    "we develop a novel way to refract a plane - wave . throughout these specific examples",
    "we will demonstrate how discontinuous fields can be used to create novel electromagnetic devices .",
    "the answer to the question of how one imposes a discontinuity in the electromagnetic field , follows from a simple examination of the boundary conditions presented in electromagnetic theory . to see this",
    "let us imagine an empty space ( free space ) without any materials present .",
    "we then have an arbitrary boundary that divides our space into two halves and is described by a unit normal @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalboundarydisc ] . the two half spaces are also numbered respectively as shown . without loss of generality",
    "we assume ( throughout this paper ) a field distribution that is invariant along the @xmath1-axis ( @xmath2 .",
    "we also assume a polarization of the fields with the electric field along the z - axis , @xmath3 , and the magnetic field in the plane .",
    "[ fig : currentdisc ]     +   + on side one of the boundary we have some distribution of electromagnetic fields which we refer to as @xmath4 . on side two of the boundary",
    "we have a different distribution of electromagnetic fields which are referred to as @xmath5 .",
    "because the tangential fields are different on either side of the boundary we must place something at the boundary to satisfy the discontinuity since electromagnetic fields are naturally continuous . from electromagnetic theory",
    "we find that what is required at the interface are electric and magnetic surface currents @xcite equal to the discontinuity of the tangential fields .",
    "this is expressed as @xmath6&=&-\\mathbf{m_s } , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : js } \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\times\\left[\\mathbf{h_2}-\\mathbf{h_1}\\right]&=&\\mathbf{j_s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the presence of these surface currents enforce the discontinuity in the fields as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : currentdisc ] . without the currents ,",
    "the fields are naturally continuous and will not change their propagation characteristics .",
    "however , by placing these currents a discontinuity can be created @xcite .",
    "+   + we now make a couple of observations about this scenario .",
    "the first observation is the active nature of the boundary . by this",
    "we mean that these currents are impressed at the boundary and radiate a field to create the overall discontinuity in the field .",
    "as we will show below for specific examples , we can envision passive scenarios by constraining the amplitudes of the field on either side of the boundary .",
    "+   + another observation is that we require both an electric and a magnetic current at the boundary .",
    "this is because we need to alter both the electric and magnetic field across the interface to alter the propagation of the wave and thus we need two degrees of freedom , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this can be thought of as a huygens source establishing the required discontinuity in the wave across the interface as it creates the desired wavefront .",
    "also it is interesting to note that the discontinuity in the fields is enforced along a boundary only and does not require any bulk materials .",
    "a potentially beneficial result that will lead to thin conformal designs that we will further develop below .",
    "+   + finally , it can be noted that this idea of impressing electric and magnetic currents across an interface is not necessarily ` new ' as it has been used in theoretical and numerical electromagnetics when applying the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "however , what is different here is the interpretation of these currents as physical quantities which can be used to engineer the propagation of the electromagnetic wave across the boundary .",
    "this then raises another questions : how can these currents be physically realized ? to answer this we will introduce two ways to impress electric and magnetic currents along a boundary .",
    "firstly , using active electric and magnetic dipoles . secondly using passive impedance and admittance surfaces .      the simplest way to implement a sheet of surface current , whether electric or magnetic , is to discretize the current using dipoles .",
    "this is a well known idea from antenna array theory where discrete arrays are approximated by a surface current @xcite . here a set of electric and magnetic dipole arrays is needed .",
    "such a configuration has been investigated for improving the receive characteristics of an antenna array @xcite , though here we are looking at such combined arrays as a source for discontinuous wavefronts . for the electric currents , the current is discretized by an array of electric dipole antennas . for the magnetic currents ,",
    "magnetic dipoles can be used to discretize the currents . because of the assumed polarization of the fields , the electric currents are along the @xmath1-axis , @xmath9 and the magnetic currents are in the plane and tangential to the boundary @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the unit tangent vector of the boundary . because of this , the electric dipole antennas lie along the @xmath1-axis and the magnetic dipole antennas along the @xmath11 direction .",
    "+   + the next question then is how many electric and magnetic dipoles are needed to appropriately discretize the continuous currents in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ms ] and [ eq : js ] .",
    "assuming we can describe our boundary as a parameterized curve of coordinate @xmath12 , let us divide up the boundary into segments of length @xmath13 with a unit height @xmath14",
    ". then the electric and magnetic dipole moments are given by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "these dipole moments can be approximated as point sources spaced every @xmath13 which gives , @xmath17 , @xmath17 .",
    "the discretized electric and magnetic currents then are then given by a sum of these discrete dipole moments , @xmath18 the spacing of these dipole moments , @xmath13 , must sample the currents so that they capture the ` fastest ' spatial variation of the currents at the boundary . thus from sampling theory @xcite , we set @xmath13 to be small enough such that all the spatial variation of the electric and magnetic currents is captured .",
    "this can be found by taking the fourier transform of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in some cases",
    ", @xmath13 may be different for the electric and magnetic currents leading to a different number of electric and magnetic dipoles .",
    "+   + to physically implement these electric and magnetic dipoles , the simplest way is to use small antennas .",
    "for the electric dipole , a traditional metallic strip of current can be used , while for the magnetic dipole a metallic loop of current would suffice .      another way to introduce a discontinuity in the fields is to use a surface which scatters the field .",
    "such surfaces can be characterized by an impedance @xcite .",
    "these impedance surfaces form a boundary condition which have the following properties : @xmath19 & = & 0 , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : himpsurf } \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\times \\left [ \\mathbf{h_2}-\\mathbf{h_1}\\right ] & = & \\mathbf{j_s } , \\\\ \\label{eq : zimpsurf } \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\times\\mathbf{e_1}&=&z_s \\mathbf{j_s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in general @xmath20 is a complex impedance that relates the discontinuity in the magnetic field to the continuous electric field .",
    "physically these surfaces are made up of planar metallic scatterers on which the induced currents radiate a scattered field .",
    "this scattered field when added with the incident field yields a total field which satisfies eq .  [ eq : eimpsurf]- eq .",
    "[ eq : zimpsurf ] .",
    "+   + of course , given the discussion above , this boundary condition alone would not be able to introduce a discontinuity in the field because we need both electric and magnetic currents .",
    "thus , arguing from duality @xcite , we can envision another boundary condition which we will refer to as an admittance surface which is described by the following boundary condition : @xmath21 & = & -\\mathbf{m_s } , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : hadmsurf } \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\times \\left [ \\mathbf{h_2}-\\mathbf{h_1}\\right ] & = & 0 , \\\\ \\label{eq : yadmsurf } \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\\times\\mathbf{h_1}&=&y_s \\mathbf{m_s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a complex admittance that relates the discontinuity in the electric field to the continuous magnetic field .",
    "it is worth asking what such a surface would look like . in this case",
    "the scatterers would be metallic loop - like objects on which induced loops of current radiate a scattered field equivalent to what the magnetic current in eq .",
    "[ eq : eadmsurf ] would radiate . +   + with these two boundary conditions ,",
    "a combined surface made up of both impedance and admittance boundary conditions can be used to introduce a discontinuity in the electric and magnetic field . to achieve this",
    "we can modify the scenario given in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalboundarydisc ] by dividing up the fields on either side of the boundary . here",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are divided into two groups .",
    "the first group is the continuous electric field and magnetic fields given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 . at the boundary",
    "the continuous fields are equal to each other with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the other group is the discontinuous fields which are given by @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 . at the boundary these fields are not equal to each other .",
    "now by grouping the continuous electric field and the discontinuous magnetic field , an impedance at the boundary can be defined by applying eq .",
    "[ eq : eimpsurf]-eq .",
    "[ eq : zimpsurf ] .",
    "likewise , by grouping the continuous magnetic field and the discontinuous electric field an admittance can be defined from eq .",
    "[ eq : eadmsurf]-eq .",
    "[ eq : yadmsurf ] .",
    "this combined surface can then be used to introduce a discontinuity in the electromagnetic field .",
    "+   + in general without placing any constraints on the fields across the interface , @xmath20 and @xmath22 will be complex and the real part of both quantities could be less than zero @xcite .",
    "an impedance or admittance with a negative real part implies that the surface is active and supplying power to the system .",
    "however as we will show below we can envision specific scenarios where the real part is constrained to be passive and lossless .",
    "as we demonstrated in @xcite an array of electric and magnetic dipoles can be used to cloak an object . using this idea of discontinuous electromagnetic fields we introduce two other cloaking schemes which can hide an object by introducing a discontinuity in the field at the boundary .",
    "+   + in the first example , a discontinuity is imposed on the boundary of a scatterer illuminated by a plane - wave . by carefully choosing this discontinuity we can create a cloak which cancels the scattered field outside the cloak while leaving the fields undisturbed inside the cloak .",
    "this creates a cloak which can interact with the field inside the volume without disturbing the field outside , similar to the anti - cloak proposed in @xcite but without using bulk materials .",
    "+   +    our object to be cloaked is a dielectric cylindrical scatterer situated at the origin and of infinite extent along the @xmath1-axis .",

    "similar designs have been constructed using either passive arrays of nano - antennas @xcite or blazed grating - like structures @xcite .",
    "+   + despite the different language used between the microwave and optical communities , these ideas all follow a similar logic that is easily described using a refraction law derived from a phase discontinuity between the refracted and incident fields @xcite . here a linear phase shift along the elements that make up the surface are used to alter the direction of the incident plane - wave .",

    "note here , that for small values of both @xmath54 and @xmath52 the curves overlap . this can be seen from inserting small - angle expressions for the angles into eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] .",
    "this implies that for small angles , a fixed combined impedance / admittance surface can predictably refract an incident plane wave of an arbitrary angle of incidence .",
    "however , as both these values diverge the impedance and admittance curves diverge from each other as well . in general then , like the active cloaks shown here and in @xcite , we are constrained with knowing the incident field to design our surface for a desired angle of refraction , @xmath54",
    ". +   + again , these admittance and impedance surfaces act like a passive huygens source which generates the required wavefronts to construct the refracted field .",
    "the incident plane - wave along a direction @xmath52 induces electric and magnetic currents on the impedance and admittance surface respectively which independently radiate a scattered field which interferes to form a refracted plane - wave in the direction of @xmath54 +   + if we had not been so careful as to constrain the amplitudes of the refracted fields we would have arrived at impedance and admittance surfaces which had a non - zero and possible negative real part .",
    "this would have implied a surface which scattered more power then was incident on it and would be analogous to the example in section [ subsec : activerefraction ] where we used an active dipole array to refract a plane - wave .",
    "as we have shown for refraction , the power in the incident field can simply be redirected into the refracted field by a passive surface as long as the amplitudes are constrained .",
    "thus an active surface is not truly needed ( though it does demonstrate the concept of a field discontinuity ) .",
    "to contrast , for cloaking the power in the incident and scattered field is already conserved @xcite .",
    "thus to enforce a discontinuity in the field which cancels the scattered field the power must come from elsewhere , in this case an array of electric and magnetic dipoles ( note that this is different than bending the light around the object as in @xcite or resonating out a specific multipole order of the scattered field @xcite which are passive cloaking schemes but which do not superimpose a field into the problem ) .",
    "+   + finally , we note that this construction of impedance and admittance surfaces gives the full description of how to refract a plane - wave across a surface . as a point of comparison",
    ", we can look at how refraction and reflection of a plane - wave across a material interface is derived .",
    "here we notice three attributes about this process .",
    "first it is derived from the boundary conditions at a material interface .",
    "secondly , it tells us how the field will refract and reflect ( snell s law ) .",
    "third , it tells us the amplitudes of the field ( the fresnel reflection coefficients ) .",
    "here we have the same attributes but realized using a combined impedance / admittance surface . for a surface .",
    "starting from the boundary conditions given by impedance and admittance surfaces , we have derived how the field will refract across a surface for different impedances ( eq .  [ eq : xs ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] ) and we have found the amplitudes of those fields in eq .",
    "[ eq : refractedamp ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : reflamp ] .",
    "this gives us a complete picture for how to tailor a surface to refract ( or reflect ) an incident plane - wave .",
    "+   + in comparison , the generalized refraction law in eq .",
    "[ eq : generalrefraction ] simply tells us the phase gradient between the two refracted plane - waves .",
    "it does not tell us how to synthesize a surface .",
    "( and as shown , trying to synthesize a surface which simply mimics the phase gradient is incomplete ) .",
    "thus this equation is descriptive , as it describes how a plane - wave refracts across a surface , but it is not prescriptive in that it does not tell us how to design our surface .",
    "[ eq : generalrefraction ] is useful as a preliminary step as we can envision an arbitrary gradient along a surface which encodes some functionality ( focusing , beam steering , vortexes ) with respect to some incident field .",
    "however we would then need to use the equations given in eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] to synthesize the required surface using both electric and magnetic currents generated by the impedance and admittance surfaces .",
    "we can verify these results by using two simple full - wave simulations .",
    "the first example is to use the two - dimensional method of moments to solve for the required impedance and admittance as well as the fields radiated by the surface .",
    "the second example is using a commercial full - wave solver ( hfss ) to demonstrate a very basic physical implementation of this concept above .      to analyze the refraction through a surface",
    "we can use a two - dimensional method of moments procedure to numerically synthesize the required admittance and impedance as well as to find the radiation from the induced currents on the surface , confirming the results above @xcite .",
    "+   + for the impedance surface the induced electric currents on the surface can be found from examining the relationship between the incident , scattered and total fields at the boundary @xmath90 the scattered field is created by the radiation of the electric currents induced on the surface which is given by @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the length of the impedance surface .",
    "+   + likewise , for the admittance surface , we can solve for the magnetic currents by examining the incident , total and scattered field at the boundary @xmath93 here we must find the tangential magnetic field created by the radiation of the magnetic currents on the surface which is given to be , @xmath94 both eq .  [ eq : jsmom ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : msmom ] can be solved for @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively using the method of moments since we know both the desired total fields and incident field at the boundary .",
    "to solve , the impedance surface is discretized into n segments and is solved for using pulse - basis functions and point matching @xcite .",
    "once @xmath7 and @xmath8 are found , these can be respectively inserted into eq .",
    "[ eq : zimpsurf ] and eq.[eq : yadmsurf ] .",
    "+   + to demonstrate this we take an example where our incident field is in the normal direction , @xmath95 and our desired refracted beam is along @xmath96 .",
    "our impedance and admittance surfaces are @xmath97 long at @xmath98  ghz .",
    "we divide our surface up into @xmath99 segments that are @xmath100 long .",
    "the calculated reactance and susceptance are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : momrefractionimpedanceradiation ] along with the theoretical values given by eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] where good agreement can be seen between the two sets of curves .",
    "we can also find the total field on either side of the screen by finding the fields radiated from both sets of currents . on side two of the boundary these fields must be summed with the incident field .",
    "these radiated fields are given by , @xmath101 dy',\\\\ \\mathbf{e_s}&=&\\mathbf{e_{s , elec}}+\\mathbf{e_{s , mag}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plotting these radiated fields in fig .",
    "[ fig : momrefractionimpedanceradiation ] , we find a field that resembles the theoretical prediction fairly well on either side of the screen with the discrepancies coming from the finite nature of the screen . on side two of the screen",
    "we have a field which resembles a plane - wave propagating along @xmath96 . on side one of the screen",
    "there is a small reflected field as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : reflamp ] which is plane - wave along the @xmath95 direction .",
    "note however that the amplitude of these fields is much smaller than the refracted fields on the other side of the screen .",
    "this indicates that a surface of induced magnetic and electric currents through impedances and admittances allows for a discontinuity in the electric and magnetic field to be realized .      as stated before ,",
    "the impedance and admittance surfaces set up induced electric and magnetic currents to impose a discontinuity in the field .",
    "to physically implement such a surface we can take a cue from the active version of this idea and use passive dipoles and loops to create our induced electric and magnetic currents .",
    "we will demonstrate this idea by using an array of loops loaded with a reactive impedance to create our induced magnetic current .",
    "we will use dipoles loaded reactively to create induced electric currents . by varying the reactive loading on each loop / dipole the impedance and admittance of the surface can be tuned .",
    "+   + to model this we will use ansys s hfss .",
    "again we will use the same example as before at @xmath102  ghz with an incident field at @xmath95 and a refracted field at @xmath96 .",
    "we will place our simulation in a parallel - plate waveguide to simplify the computation and emulate a 2-d environment .",
    "taking the impedances and admittances given in fig .",
    "[ fig : momrefractionimpedanceradiation ] , each loop / dipole is designed to implement the desired impedance at its location along the surface , with the loops / dipoles spaced every @xmath103 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfssgaussianbeamimpadmefieldcombined ] . to illuminate the surface",
    "a gaussian beam is used with a @xmath104 focal spot designed to occur at the surface . with this design",
    "we offer a couple of caveats .",
    "first the unit cells are not optimal and better designs are possible .",
    "secondly the impedance variation along the surface is not optimized for a finite beam such as a gaussian beam .",
    "nonetheless the main point can be demonstrated here with this simple array of passive loops and dipoles .",
    "+   +    the simulated results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfssgaussianbeamimpadmefieldcombined ] where the field - plot at 1.5ghz is shown . here",
    "we can see that the gaussian beam is refracted by the surface from an incident direction of @xmath95 to a refracted direction of @xmath96 .",
    "reflections are also minimal though any discrepancies can be attributed to the reasons given above . the far - field pattern of the scattered field is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfssgaussianbeamimpadmefieldcombined ] where we can see the main refracted beam at @xmath105 .",
    "the peak at @xmath106 is the field radiated by the surface to cancel out the incident field on side two of the surface ( as we are plotting the scattered field ) .",
    "there is a reflected peak at @xmath107 due to the small reflected field that is generated by the surface and a reflected peak at @xmath108 that is not completely canceled out due to the imperfections in the surface .",
    "this can be improved upon further optimization of the screen .",
    "through the examples presented in this work , we have demonstrated how the idea of discontinuous fields can be used to alter , shape and control electromagnetic wavefronts . by placing electric and magnetic currents at a boundary ,",
    "the fields can be altered in a variety of novel ways including the ability to cloak an object and the ability to refract ( or reflect ) an incident field .",
    "we have shown that we can create our electric and magnetic currents in one of two main ways , either by placing a discrete array of active electric and magnetic dipoles which impress a discontinuity in the field . or by using a passive impedance and admittance surface , on which electric and magnetic currents are induced to create a discontinuity . +   + this approach of imposing a discontinuity in the electromagnetic field opens up many new possibilities across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "some interesting areas include the synthesis of active electric and magnetic dipole arrays as well as passive impedance and admittance surfaces at both microwave frequencies , using well known technologies in phased - arrays and impedance surface @xcite , and at optical and thz frequencies using more recent developments such as nano - antennas , nanophotonic phased - ararys and nano - circuits @xcite .",
    "the design of novel devices using discontinuous fields including lenses , cloaks , reflectors , can also be envisioned using this new technique and presents a promising avenue for future work .",
