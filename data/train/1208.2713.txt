    "in the final decade before his untimely death , pierre duclos embarked upon a large  scale systematic study of atoms and molecules in strong homogeneous magnetic fields . this topic had already received considerable attention in the astrophysics and mathematical physics community ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the published record of pierre s involvement started with the paper @xcite ( which can to a large measure be accredited to him ) , which established the norm - resolvent convergence , as the magnetic field strength tends to infinity , of the pauli hamiltonian of a non - relativistic atom in a constant magnetic field to an effective hamiltonian describing a one - dimensional atom with the electrostatic interaction replaced by dirac @xmath0 point - interactions .",
    "though there exists a long and respected tradition in theoretical physics and chemistry of using hamiltonians with @xmath0-potentials as toy models ( going back , at least , to the kronig and penney model of solid state physics ) , this theorem gave an example of such @xmath0-potentials naturally arising as part of a genuine physical problem .",
    "around the same time , @xcite proved by a different method that the ground - state energy of the true hamiltonian converges to that of the corresponding @xmath2-hamiltonian .",
    "the hartree functional associated to the @xmath2-hamiltonian had already made its appearance in @xcite .",
    "the approach initiated in @xcite was further developed in @xcite , which established a three - member hierarchy of effective multi - particle hamiltonians on the line , each one of which is asymptotic , in norm - resolvent sense , to the full pauli - hamiltonian , but with increasingly better rates of convergence .",
    "the @xmath0-hamiltonian is the member of this family with the slowest convergence .",
    "this paper also analyzed the effect of imposing particle anti - symmetry which , on the level of the @xmath0-hamiltonian , translates into the latter acting on a certain direct sum of fermionic @xmath3-spaces and @xmath3-spaces with no symmetry - restriction at all ; cf .",
    "section 2 below for the case of two electrons .",
    "an early announcement of some of the results of @xcite , which took a long time in writing , was made in @xcite .    despite its apparent simplicity , the spectral analysis of these @xmath0-hamiltonians is far from trivial , except in the case of a single electron . as a first step , pierre , together with santiago prez - oyarzn and two of the present authors , investigated in @xcite the molecular @xmath4-ion in the born - oppenheimer approximation in strong magnetic fields , taking the corresponding @xmath0-model as its starting point .",
    "the latter is explicitly solvable for a one electron molecule , and its solution can be used , in combination with second order perturbation theory , to obtain the correct values of the equilibrium distance and of the binding energy for strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath5 to @xmath6 a.u .",
    "building upon this paper , it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that as the field - strength @xmath7 increases , the equilibrium distance between the nuclei in the born - oppenheimer approximation tends to 0 , both for the @xmath0-model and for the full molecular pauli hamiltonian , for the latter at a rate of @xmath8 this naturally suggested the possibility of using strong magnetic fields to facilitate nuclear fusion by enhanced tunnelling through the coulomb barrier , a point which was taken up by ackermann and hogreve @xcite , who numerically computed accurate equilibrium separation distances , as well as the corresponding nuclear fusion rates , for a range of @xmath7 s from 0 and @xmath9 for field strengths @xmath7 of the order of @xmath10 they indeed found a drastic increase of the tunnelling cross sections .",
    "unfortunately , such @xmath7 s are still much too big to be generated in a laboratory on earth .    in a parallel set of papers @xcite and @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , as well as in hitherto unpublished work , pierre , in cooperation with various co - authors and building upon an important earlier paper of rosenthal @xcite , developed a systematic method for analyzing the spectrum of these multi - particle @xmath2-hamiltonians , which he baptised the skeleton method , and which basically reduces the spectral analysis of such an hamiltonian to that of a finite - dimensional system of @xmath11-dimensional integral operators , @xmath12 being the number of particles ( note that @xmath13 is then the dimension of the support of any of the @xmath0-potentials occurring in this @xmath0-hamiltonian ) .",
    "this system , which is called the skeleton of the original hamiltonian , is still too complicated to be solved explicitly even for an @xmath12 as small as 2 , but opens the way for a systematic numerical approach ( as was done by rosenthal for the helium - type @xmath0-atom with @xmath14 ) . for arbitrary",
    "@xmath12 the size of this system of integral operators will be @xmath15 , though this can be reduced by particle symmetry and parity considerations .",
    "the present paper takes up the work of @xcite , @xcite for the @xmath4-ion by studying the existence and equilibrium distance of the @xmath1-molecule in the @xmath2-approximation .",
    "we show that the equilibrium distance , in this approximation , again tends to 0 as @xmath16 , at the same speed as that found for @xmath4 .",
    "the paper should be seen as a part of a larger and more ambitious project of pierre , which was to prove this for arbitrary pauli molecules in strong magnetic fields . in the context of enhanced fusion",
    ", one might hope , following @xcite , that adding more electrons would lead to increased shrinking of the equilibrium distance through better shielding of the nuclear charges .",
    "our results suggest that such an effect will not show up in the top order asymptotics of this equilibrium distance as function of the field strength @xmath7 , though it might of course still make itself noticeable at finite but large @xmath7 .",
    "a major problem for the analysis of the @xmath17-molecule is that , unlike for @xmath4 , the corresponding @xmath0-model is no longer explicitly solvable , and we will arrive at our conclusions by a combination of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "in particular , a key intermediary result we need is that the electronic ground - state energy ( that is , leaving out the internuclear repulsion term ) of the molecular @xmath2-hamiltonian be an increasing function of the internuclear distance .",
    "this seems physically intuitive , but we have been unable to find an analytic proof . for non - relativistic single - electron molecules without magnetic field , monotonicity of the electronic energy in the internuclear distance was shown in @xcite , @xcite ; we are not aware of any rigorous results for the multi - electron case , with or without magnetic field . by deriving explicit estimates for the equilibrium distance and minimal energy associated to an elementary variational upper bound of the molecular ground - state energy , and combining these with a trivial lower bound , we are able to show that it suffices to know the monotonicity of the ( true ) electronic ground - state for a certain range of internuclear distances .",
    "the latter was , amongst other things , verified numerically in @xcite , using pierre s skeleton method .",
    "as will be clear , this paper s conclusions are far from complete , and the paper is perhaps best seen as a work - in - progress report on a project pierre was working on at the time of his death , one of the very many he was actively involved in .",
    "his absence , and the impossibility of the lively exchange of ideas we had grown accustomed to having with him , are sorely felt by the three surviving authors .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we want to study the equilibrium distance , in the born - oppenheimer approximation , of the non - relativistic @xmath1-molecule in a strong constant magnetic field , in the large field limit .",
    "we take the magnetic field directed along the @xmath18-axis , and the two nuclei , of charge @xmath19 , aligned in the direction of the field and located at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the unit vector in the direction of the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the molecule is described by the familiar two - electron pauli - hamiltonian @xmath22 ( which we wo nt write down explicitly ) acting on anti - symmetric wave - functions which include spin - coordinates , and therefore are functions of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the spatial variables of the @xmath26-th electron , and @xmath27 are its the spin variables ; the anti - symmetrisation is done with respect to all the variables .",
    "we fix the total ( orbital ) angular momentum in the field - direction to be @xmath28 , which we can do since the corresponding component of the angular momentum operator commutes with the pauli - hamiltonian .",
    "in this situation it can be shown by the methods of @xcite , @xcite that the full hamiltonian @xmath22 , after projection onto the lowest landau band , is asymptotic , in norm - resolvent sense , to the following two - electron schrdinger operator with @xmath2-potentials on @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31 will act on a certain direct sum of copies of @xmath32 and @xmath33 which we specify below , where `` a.s . ''",
    "stands for asymmetric wave - functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the definition of @xmath31 are related to the original parameters @xmath36 and @xmath7 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the principal branch of the lambert - function , defined as that branch of the inverse of @xmath40 which passes through 0 and is positive for positive @xmath41 ; cf . , @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath42 as @xmath16 , since @xmath43 .",
    "we also let @xmath44 the electronic part of @xmath31 ( at fixed @xmath34 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath31 and @xmath45 are defined in form - sense , as closed quadratic forms on the first order sobolev space @xmath46 .",
    "their operator domain consists of those functions @xmath47 in @xmath46 whose restrictions to @xmath48 are in the second order sobolev space @xmath49 , and whose gradients satisfy an appropriate jump  condition across the supports of the different @xmath2-potentials : specifically @xmath50 , with a similar condition involving the normal derivative of @xmath47 across @xmath51 , but with opposite sign : cf . ,",
    "the appendix of @xcite for details .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the precise technical sense in which @xmath22 and @xmath31 are asymptotic , but note that this will imply that if @xmath31 has an eigenvalue @xmath52 then @xmath22 will have an eigenvalue at distance @xmath53 of @xmath54    the hilbert space in which @xmath31 and @xmath45 act is , by @xcite , theorem 1.8 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which is either empty or a singleton ( depending on whether @xmath28 is odd or even ) . observe that unless @xmath58 , @xmath59 will always be non - empty , and , consequently , the infimum of the spectrum of @xmath31 will be the infimum of its spectrum on @xmath60 , which equals the infimum of the spectrum of its restriction to the bosonic subspace of symmetric wave - functions in @xmath61 , despite having originally started off with fermionic electrons .",
    "for the higher lying eigenvalues , no symmetry restrictions have to be taken into account , at least for the @xmath0-hamiltonian - the situation will be different for the full pauli - hamiltonian .",
    "since for @xmath62 , @xmath31 acts on @xmath63 while for @xmath64 , it acts on a hilbert - space containing @xmath60 as a direct summand , it is clear , for any fixed value of the inter - nuclear distance @xmath34 , that the ground state of @xmath45 , if it exists , occurs in any of the sectors with @xmath64 .",
    "it then follows that for sufficiently large @xmath7 , the ground state of ( the electronic part of ) the pauli - hamiltonian @xmath22 itself also exists and occurs in one of the sectors with @xmath65 this was observed in numerical studies .",
    "the ground - state of the @xmath1 molecule was computed numerically ( by the variational method ) in @xcite , @xcite , and that of the two - electron @xmath66-ion more recently in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for both these molecules the ground - state changes , with increasing @xmath7 , from a spin singlet state with @xmath62 ( for @xmath67 ) to a , bound or unbound , spin triplet state ( both electron spins parallel ) still with @xmath62 to a strongly bound spin triplet state with @xmath68 ( using molecular term symbols , the transition is @xmath69 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for other small molecular ions such as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , cf . @xcite and its references .",
    "we should note that it is implicit in the definition of @xmath72 that all the electron spins are taken anti - parallel to the magnetic field ( since @xmath31 effectively operates on the projection of the full hilbert space with spin onto the lowest landau state - cf .",
    "@xcite ) so that the ground state of @xmath31 will correspond to a triplet state of the pauli - hamiltonian . for further numerical studies of spectra of atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields ,",
    "see for example the two conference proceedings @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath73 denote the one - dimensional @xmath74molecule as defined by the @xmath0hamiltonian , @xmath75 we will study this molecule for arbitrary nuclear charge @xmath19 , but will often single out the case of @xmath76 , corresponding to @xmath1 , as well as the case of @xmath77 which provides an aymptotic description of the molecular @xmath78ion in the large field limit .",
    "the two main results of our paper are :    [ existence ] ( existence of @xmath73 )    \\(i ) if @xmath79 , then the electronic hamiltonian @xmath45 possesses a ground state for all @xmath80    \\(ii ) the @xmath73-molecule exists ( in born oppenheimer sense ) for all @xmath79 , as long as @xmath81 for @xmath77 , this can be sharpened to @xmath82 or @xmath83    we recall that the molecule exists in born ",
    "oppenheimer sense if @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the infimum of the spectrum of @xmath86 , and if moreover there exists an @xmath87 such that @xmath88 and @xmath89 is an eigenvalue of @xmath90 ; note that @xmath91 and continuity of @xmath85 already imply that the infimum is attained .",
    "we will call any @xmath92 in which @xmath85 assumes its global minimum an equilibrium distance of the molecule .",

    "we conjecture that , as a corollary of these theorems , the actual molecule as modelled by the pauli hamiltonian can also be shown rigorously to exist for @xmath79 and sufficiently large @xmath7 , and that its equilibrium distance behaves as @xmath97 for some constant @xmath98 ( note that by ( [ def : a;epsilon ] ) , @xmath99 if @xmath100 ) . for @xmath4",

    "we discuss by way of example the case of a hydrogen molecule ( @xmath76 ) in a magnetic field with field - strength corresponding to @xmath283 , or @xmath284 .",
    "we recall ( cf . for example",
    "[ bbdp ] ) that the magnetic field is measured in units of @xmath285 , where @xmath286 stands for gauss and @xmath287 for tesla . moreover , the energy is measure in units of @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the cyclotron frequency , and distance in units of the bohr radius @xmath290 .",
    "our @xmath283 therefore corresponds to a magnetic field of @xmath291 , which is of course not realizable on earth , but may be realistic for a neutron star .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ] displays the graph @xmath85 ( solid line ) as well as , for the sake of comparison , that of @xmath292 ( medium dash line ) , @xmath293 ( small dash line ) and @xmath294 ( large dash line ) .",

    "nevertheless , following @xcite , it may be small enough to significantly enhance the probability for protons to pass through the electronic barrier and be trapped in the nuclear well",

    "differentiability of @xmath127 follows from norm - differentiability of the resolvent , which can be established using the symmetrized resolvent equation - we skip the details .",
    "we next study @xmath305 .",

    "a formal application of the feynman - hellman theorem would lead to @xmath308 however , we have to be careful here : since @xmath309 a priori has a jump in @xmath310 , @xmath311 is not an admissible test - function for @xmath312    we will first establish feynman - hellman on the level of quadratic forms .",
    "if we write @xmath313 ( to more clearly bring out the parameter dependence in the notations ) , the eigen - equation @xmath314 translates into @xmath315 for all @xmath316 in @xmath317 , the form - domain of @xmath137 we now carefully differentiate with respect to @xmath34 , taking into account that @xmath318 is only left- and right- differentiable with respect to @xmath319 in @xmath320 .",
    "furthermore , the derivative of the arbitrary @xmath321-function @xmath316 only exists in @xmath3-sense .",
    "however , anticipating that we will take @xmath322 below , we assume that the relevant left- and right- derivatives of @xmath323 also exist . using the norm - differentiability of @xmath324 with respect to @xmath34 ( as an @xmath3-valued function of @xmath34 ) and taking right - derivatives with respect to @xmath34",

    "it can be shown , using the methods of @xcite , that this approximation is exact in the large field limit .",
    "we have shown , for this approximation , that the ground state of the molecule exists , for any nuclear charge @xmath79 and for sufficiently large magnetic fields , and that the ( re - scaled ) inter - nuclear equilibrium distance of the molecule tends to 0 with increasing field - strength @xmath7 , at a rate of @xmath340 this generalises earlier results for @xmath4 in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . of the numerous questions which remain , the foremost one is to extend these results to the full pauli - hamiltonian .",
    "this was possible for the single - electron @xmath341-ion , but the argument for the equilibrium distance given in @xcite used the exact solution of the @xmath0-model . in the case of the two - electron @xmath1",
    "such exact solutions are not available anymore , despite the apparent simplicity of the @xmath2-potentials , and we have had in part to rely on numerical computations to prove our results , notably to establish monotonicity of the electronic ground - state energy as function of the inter - nuclear distance . since this would already imply that the inter - nuclear distance tends to 0 at the proper rate ( cf . the remarks just before lemma [ interval ] ) , it would be very interesting to find an analytical proof of this monotonicity , or at least on a sufficiently large interval ( such as the one specified in lemma [ interval ] ) .",
    "another interesting question which remains open is that of uniqueness of the equilibrium position , for the @xmath0-approximation as well as for the full pauli - molecule .",
    "we also relied on numerical computations in the study of our variational upper bound and lower bounds . here",
    "it may be possible to give analytic proofs , since these upper and lower bounds have analytically closed expressions involving a particular and well - understood special function , the lambert @xmath39-function . it would furthermore be interesting to find sharper variational upper bounds , e.g. by using test functions which incorporate electron - electron correlations .",
    "other perspectives are to go beyond the born  oppenheimer approximation and analyse the effect of nuclear vibrations on the stability of the nuclei , and to compute the probability of tunnelling through the coulomb barrier .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see to what extend the methods and results of this paper can be extended to diatomic molecules with an arbitrary number of electrons .",
