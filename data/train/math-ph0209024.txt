    "in recent years , thermodynamics of solvable lattice models related to superalgebras have been studied by thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) method , and tba equations are examined from various point of view ( see , section 1 in @xcite for a comment on the present status of tba equations for models related to superalgebras ) . in our previous papers , we have derived tba equations for the @xmath2 model @xcite and the @xmath0 model @xcite from the string hypothesis and the @xmath1-system @xcite of the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) .",
    "these tba equations contain an infinite number of unknown functions , and thus are not always easily treated .",
    "it is important to reduce the tba equations to tractable integral equations which contain only a finite number of unknown functions .    as for the @xmath3 spin chain , which is related to the algebra @xmath4 of rank one , takahashi proposed @xcite a nonlinear integral equation ( nlie ) recently .",
    "this nlie contains only one unknown function . due to its simplicity",
    ", we can calculate @xcite the high temperature expansion of physical quantities to very high order from this nlie .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to derive a system of nlie with only a _",
    "finite _ number ( the number of rank @xmath5 ) of unknown functions from our @xmath0 version of the @xmath1-system @xcite .",
    "this letter is the first attempt to derive this type of nlie for a vertex model associated with an algebra of _ arbitrary _ rank . of an underlining quantum affine algebra",
    "is root of unity ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath1-system becomes a finite set of difference equations .",
    "thus the corresponding tba equation becomes a finite set of integral equations .",
    "see , @xcite for tba analysis of integrable field theories related to @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that different types of nlie with finite numbers of unknown functions for different algebras of arbitrary rank were considered in @xcite in rather different contexts . ] in section 2 , we briefly mention the @xmath1-system for the @xmath0 model and the qtm method @xcite .",
    "this section overlaps with section 2 and section 4 in @xcite , but normalization of the fused qtm is different from @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we derive the nlie .",
    "the normalized qtm defined in section 2 play the role of the unknown functions of these nlie .",
    "these nlie contain a parameter @xmath7 , which corresponds to the fusion degree of the model . for @xmath8 , these nlie form a closed set of equations , which contains only a finite number of unknown functions . on the other hand for @xmath9 , they couple with the ones for @xmath8 , and contain an infinite number of unknown functions .",
    "this type of equations ( for @xmath9 ) has never been considered before even in the case of takahashi s nlie for the @xmath3 spin chain @xcite .",
    "these nlie relate to traditional tba equations through the dependant variable transformation ( [ y - fun ] ) . using our new nlie",
    ", we calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy in section 4 .",
    "section 5 are devoted to discussions .",
    "in this section , we consider @xcite an integrable spin chain@xcite associated with the fundamental representation of @xmath0 , and introduce the qtm @xcite and the @xmath1-system @xcite for this model .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix@xcite of this model is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is @xmath19 anti - diagonal matrix whose non - zero elements are @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 for @xmath26 ; @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the present model for the periodic boundary condition is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coupling constant : @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes respectively ; @xmath33 is the number of the lattice sites ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 act nontrivially on the @xmath36 th site and @xmath37 th site .",
    "the qtm is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 ; @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the transposition in the @xmath36-th space ) ; @xmath42 is the trotter number and assumed to be even . by using the largest eigenvalue @xmath43 of the qtm ( [ qtm ] ) at @xmath44",
    ", the free energy per site is expressed as @xmath45 where we set @xmath46 ( @xmath1 : temperature ) ; the boltzmann constant is set to @xmath47 .",
    "one can obtain the eigenvalue formulae of the qtm ( [ qtm ] ) by replacing the vacuum part of the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) for the row - to - row transfer matrix with that of the qtm .",
    "this dvf is imbedded into a dvf for a fusion hierarchy of the qtm .",
    "it reads as follows .",
    "@xmath48 where the summation is taken over @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the functions @xmath52 are defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; @xmath56 .",
    "the vacuum parts are given as follows @xmath57 where @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is a phase factor .",
    "@xmath60 is a solution of the bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ; @xmath65 ; @xmath66 is a phase factor . for @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", we define a normalization function @xmath69 and set @xmath70 . for @xmath71 , @xmath72 coincides with eq.(4.8 ) in @xcite .",
    "the poles of @xmath73 from the functions @xmath74 ( dress part ) are spurious under the bae ( [ bae ] ) .",
    "if one formally set the vacuum parts ( [ vac - qtm ] ) and ( [ normal ] ) to 1 , then the remaining part ( dress part ) of the dvf @xmath73 is same as the row - to - row case .",
    "thus @xmath73 satisfies the following functional relation , which has essentially the same form as the @xmath0 @xmath1-system in @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76",
    "in @xcite , takahashi s nlie for the @xmath3-model @xcite was derived from the @xmath1-system of the qtm . here",
    "we derive our new nlie from our @xmath1-system ( [ t - system ] ) .",
    "a numerical analysis for finite @xmath77 indicates that a two - string solution ( for every color ) in the sector @xmath78 of the bae ( [ bae ] ) provides the largest eigenvalue of the qtm ( [ qtm ] ) at @xmath44 @xcite . from now on , we consider only this two - string solution . in this case , the phase factors are @xmath79 for any @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , we expect the following conjecture is valid for this two - string solution @xcite .    [ conj ] for small @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ,",
    "every zero @xmath83 of @xmath73 is located near the lines @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath73 has poles only at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) : @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "these poles are of order @xmath89 at most .",
    "moreover @xmath90 is a finite number @xmath91 this is a solution of the @xmath92-system @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath68 ; @xmath94 .",
    "we are considering the case without an external field .",
    "if an external field exists , ( [ q - sys - sol ] ) will be deformed .",
    "we may assume @xmath95 where the coefficients @xmath96 are given as follows @xmath97 here the contour @xmath98 must surround @xmath99 counterclockwise manner and must not contain @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 ; the contour @xmath103 must surround @xmath104 counterclockwise manner and must not contain @xmath105 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath106 . using the @xmath1-system ( [ t - system ] ) , we can modify ( [ coeff ] ) as @xmath107 where @xmath108 . the first term and the second term in the first ( resp .",
    "second ) bracket @xmath109 in ( [ coeff2 ] ) have common poles at @xmath110 ( resp .",
    "@xmath111 ) . however , these common poles are spurious since @xmath73 has no pole at these points",
    ". we also note that a subsidiary condition @xmath112 for the excited state tba equation ( see , p.2343 in @xcite and ( [ y - fun ] ) ) follows from this observation . substituting ( [ coeff2 ] ) into ( [ expan ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath113 where @xmath114 . here the contour @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath103 ) must surround @xmath115 counterclockwise manner and must not contain @xmath116 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath117 ( resp .",
    "@xmath118 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath119 ) . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the first term and the second term in the first bracket @xmath120 in ( [ nlie1 ] ) have a common singularity at @xmath115 which contributes to the contour integral . on the other hand for @xmath8 , this singularity at @xmath115 from the first term disappears since @xmath121 .",
    "thus the contribution to the contour integral from the first term in the first bracket @xmath120 in ( [ nlie1 ] ) vanishes as long as the contour @xmath122 does not contain the singularities at @xmath123 ( cf .",
    "conjecture [ conj ] ) .",
    "this situation is parallel with the second bracket @xmath120 in ( [ nlie1 ] ) .",
    "therefore for @xmath8 , ( [ nlie1 ] ) reduces to @xmath124 where @xmath125 . here the contour @xmath122 ( resp .",
    "@xmath126 ) must surround @xmath115 counterclockwise manner and must not contain @xmath123 , @xmath127 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath128 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 , @xmath130 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath131 ) .",
    "now we shall take the trotter limit @xmath132 in ( [ nlie1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath133 where @xmath134 ; @xmath135 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) ; @xmath138 ; @xmath139 ; @xmath140 is a known function : @xmath141 here the contour @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "@xmath103 ) must surround @xmath115 counterclockwise manner with the condition @xmath142 ( resp .",
    "@xmath143 ) and must not contain @xmath144 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath145 ( resp .",
    "@xmath146 ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath147 ) .",
    "in particular for @xmath8 , we have @xmath148 where @xmath149 . here the contour @xmath122 ( resp .",

    "we note the fact that this set of nlie ( [ nlie4 ] ) contains only a _ finite _ number of unknown functions @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , we can express @xmath161 in terms of the solution of ( [ nlie4 ] ) @xmath160 by using a jacobi - trudi determinant formula @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we need not consider ( [ nlie3 ] ) for @xmath162 in practical calculations .",
    "however , consideration on ( [ nlie3 ] ) for @xmath162 manifests the relation between our new nlie and the traditional tba equations ( see , section 5 ) .",
    "the free energy per site is given as @xmath163 solving ( [ nlie4 ] ) iteratively , we can obtain the free energy through ( [ free - en ] ) . for @xmath71 case",
    ", we find ( [ nlie4 ] ) converges numerically at least for @xmath164 .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that takahashi s nlie for the @xmath165-model @xcite is very useful to calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy . in this section",
    ", we shall calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy ( [ free - en ] ) for @xmath71 by our new nlie ( [ nlie4 ] ) .",
    "we assume the following expansion for large @xmath1 : @xmath166 due to the shift of the argument @xmath167 of @xmath168 in ( [ nlie4 ] ) , we have to take into account the residues from the coefficients @xmath169 , which contrasts with the @xmath165-model case @xcite .",
    "thus the derivation is not so easy as the @xmath165-model case .",
    "but we still expect that it is easier than to use the traditional tba equation which contains an infinite number of unknown functions ( as for the high temperature expansion for the @xmath165-model from the traditional tba equation , see for example , p.124 in @xcite ) . to calculate the coefficients @xmath169 efficiently",
    ", we need further assumption for @xmath170 : @xmath171 where @xmath172 are independent of @xmath173 . substituting ( [ t - expan ] ) into ( [ nlie4 ] )",
    ", we obtain the coefficients @xmath169 up to order @xmath174 .",

    "@xmath179 we have plotted the high temperature expansion of the specific heat ( [ specific - ex ] ) in figure [ specific ] . for comparison",
    ", we also plotted a pade approximation for ( [ specific - ex ] ) . for large @xmath1 , ( [ specific - ex ] ) agrees with our tba analysis ( see , fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates the validity of our new nlie ( [ nlie4 ] ) .     and",
