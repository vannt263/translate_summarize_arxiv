    "the reduction in length scales brought about by lab - on - a - chip applications has raised a number of challenging issues .",
    "one of them is how to enable small objects to perform autonomous , directional motion ( so - called self - propulsion ) in a liquid environment @xcite . for particles of micrometer size or smaller viscous and surface forces",
    "dominate the effects of inertia .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve motion for them , new strategies have to be developed , which differ from those applicable for macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "currently two main routes are followed towards this goal .",
    "the first one is based on mimicking the ingenious mechanical locomotion strategies of natural micro - organisms such as _ e. coli _ or _ spiroplasma _ @xcite .",
    "these objects move by undergoing deformations of their bodies in a cyclic , non - reciprocal manner and by exploiting the anisotropy of the hydrodynamic drag .",
    "a thorough , extensive discussion of the developments in this area can be found in the recent reviews by lauga and powers @xcite , elgeti , winkler , and gompper @xcite , zttl and stark @xcite .",
    "a promising alternative is that of employing catalytically activated chemical reactions to extract `` chemical '' free energy from the surrounding liquid environment and to transform it into mechanical energy ( i.e. , motion of microparticles ) , resembling the way in which biological molecular motors function .",
    "one class of mechanisms to achieve this builds on ideas borrowed from classic phoresis , i.e. , colloid motion in externally maintained gradients of certain thermodynamic fields @xcite .",
    "the basic idea to achieve _",
    "self_-phoresis is to use particles which are partially covered by a catalyst in a well controlled way , designed such that symmetry breaking occurs and the particle is endowed with a `` polar '' axis .",
    "the catalyst activates a chemical reaction in the surrounding solution @xcite , generating gradients of reaction products across the surface of the colloidal particle . owing to",
    "the solvent mediated , effective interactions between the reaction product molecules and the surface of the particle , within a thin interfacial layer a gradient in the osmotic pressure along the surface of the particle emerges .",
    "this leads to hydrodynamic flow of the solution around the particle and sets it into motion . at low reynolds numbers ,",
    "the latter is similar to the mechanisms discussed theoretically in ref .",
    "yet another example is that of propulsion through pressure waves generated via catalyst activated chemical reactions in the surrounding fluid @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the mechanical swimmers and chemically powered active colloids discussed here , self - thermophoresis @xcite and photophoresis in combination with radiation - pressure @xcite have recently been proposed as alternative self - propulsion mechanisms .",
    "( in the scenario above the requirement , that only a portion of the surface is catalytically active , is necessary for particles having axial- and fore - aft symmetry . for a shape missing the latter",
    ", self - phoresis may occur even if the whole surface of the particle is covered by catalyst .",
    "for example , for a uniform reaction rate ( i.e. , a constant flux of product molecules ) across the surface of the particle , geometrical shape asymmetry is sufficient to induce an inhomogeneous number density of reaction products along the surface and therefore propulsion @xcite . )",
    "several proof - of - concept proposals of such chemically self - propelled objects , employing either self - phoresis @xcite or bubble - pumping @xcite mechanisms , have already been successfully tested experimentally .",
    "because of the intrinsic non - equilibrium character and due to the subtle combination of physics and chemistry behind this type of self - induced motility , many of the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have so far been focusing on systems which can be approximated as being _ unbounded_. recent experimental work has addressed new issues , such as improving the directionality of the motion against brownian diffusion either by using external magnetic fields and paramagnetic core particles @xcite , or by exploiting the emergence of surface - bounded steady states of motion as they can occur in the vicinity of hard walls @xcite , or by using a collection of chemically active particles as an artificial , non - biological system in order to study chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "one interesting theoretical approach consists of describing an active particle in terms of an effective langevin equation @xcite .",
    "this has been , however , critically examined experimentally by bocquet et al who have pointed out that in these out - of - equilibrium systems the notion of an `` effective temperature '' and the mapping onto systems described by equilibrium statistical mechanics are problematic @xcite .",
    "the intriguing question concerning the extent to which similarities in collective behavior between active colloids and interacting brownian particles can be captured by mappings with effective thermodynamic parameters has been recently scrutinized in ref .",
    "this latter study established criteria under which certain models of `` run - and - tumble '' particles are equivalent with the models of active particles developed in refs .",
    "however , it is important to note that in general , such systems can not be described in terms of an equation of state @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions between active swimmers have been shown to give rise to a rich behavior , such as synchronization of the swimmers @xcite .",
    "accordingly , studies of simple models for the collective dynamics of active particles are enjoying considerable attention @xcite .    returning to the framework of `` single - colloid '' systems and the emergence of self - phoresis , we note that a microscopic modeling of the processes in the interfacial region , explicitly taking into account the molecular structure of that region around a self - propeller , has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this approach allows one to keep track of the molecular details for all species at the expense , however , that only relatively small systems and short time scales can be accessed . a different strategy , pursued in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on a continuum description of these active particles , transferred from the classical theory of diffusiophoresis @xcite .",
    "although this approach involves numerous assumptions , which are discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , a qualitative agreement between the theoretical predictions and available experimental results has been reported @xcite . furthermore , for a `` dimer '' model of an active particle ( an active spherical colloid and an inert one of a different radius , connected via an infinitely thin rigid rod ) quantitative agreement has been reported between this continuum description and the results of particle based numerical simulations @xcite . recently , a theoretical formulation of self - diffusiophoresis within the framework of classical non - equilibrium thermodynamics has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the influence of the details of the chemical reaction and of the transport of the reactants and products on the emerging self - phoretic motion has also been studied recently @xcite .    in the context of chemically active particles , the question of the detailed structure of the non - equilibrium steady - state density distributions around active particles , which is central to the present study , has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . focusing on spherical colloids with catalytically active spherical caps , in refs .",
    "@xcite the number density fields have been calculated for various types of interactions ( hard core , exponentially decaying , power law resembling van der waals interactions ) .",
    "these calculations have been carried out as perturbation series in the peclet number , which for these active colloids is typically small ( see , c.f .",
    "[ model ] ) , and in the range of the interactions between the reactive species and the colloid at which these are significant with respect to the thermal energy ( e.g. , more than a percent of the latter ) .",
    "these ranges are assumed to be short compared to the size of the colloid .",
    "( if this assumption does not hold , carrying out numerical simulations seems to be the only option available @xcite . ) in principle , this systematic expansion allows one to estimate the accuracy of the approximation caused by truncating the expansion at a certain order , but it has the drawback of a dramatic increase in the difficulty of obtaining closed form expressions beyond the first or second term in the expansion . for the dimer - sphere model with one catalytic sphere rigidly connected to an inert one , in refs .",
    "@xcite a boltzmann - like _ ansatz _ was employed for the non - equilibrium distribution of reactants and products .",
    "the prefactor of these distribution was chosen to be the corresponding solution of the steady - state diffusion equation in the absence of interactions ( other than the impenetrability of the _ active _ sphere ) and with the surface of the catalytic sphere acting as a sink for the reactants and a source for the products . under the assumption",
    "that the influence of the inert sphere on the diffusion is negligible , the reactant and product distribution profiles have been calculated .",
    "obviously , in this case the accuracy of these approximations can not be assessed intrinsically but only _ a posteriori _ via comparison with results from experiments or numerical simulations .",
    "for example , in ref . @xcite it has been shown that such _ approximate analytic _ results are in good agreement with data obtained from direct md simulations .",
    "we note here , however , that as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is important to account for the distortion of the density distributions due to the impenetrability of the inert sphere  in particular if the active sphere is only partially covered by catalyst and the two spheres do not touch  in order to fully understand how the inert sphere facilitates or hinders the emerging motion of the dimer .",
    "here we study in detail a mesoscopic model of an active colloid with a catalytic patch on its surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , so that the reactants , diffusing in a ( _ chemically passive _ ) solvent , react at this part of the surface by converting themselves into ( diffusive ) reaction products .",
    "the initial distribution of the reactants is taken to be homogeneous , but in the course of time and near the colloid a depletion zone for the reactants can emerge .",
    "we first focus on a simple reaction process in which a reactant @xmath0 converts itself into a single product molecule @xmath1 , but further on we consider also the more general dissociation reaction @xmath2 , in which two product molecules @xmath1 and @xmath3 emerge upon contact of an @xmath0 molecule with the catalytic patch .",
    "we note that this latter process directly connects with , e.g. , the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen which has often been used in experimental realizations of chemically automotive particles ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "we focus on understanding the steady - state structure of the number density fields of the product(s ) and reactants near the active colloid by taking into account that reactants and products may have different diffusion coefficients and different interaction potentials with the colloid .",
    "distinct from the related previous approaches in refs .",
    "@xcite discussed above , in order to calculate these non - equilibrium steady - state distributions we adopt an idea proposed previously and studied in the context of calculating chemical reaction rate constants @xcite . by replacing",
    "therein the position dependent sink ( for the reactant ) and source ( for products ) boundary conditions on the surface of the active particle with certain effective ones , a _ completely analytical _ calculation of these steady - state density profiles can be carried out for quite general types of interactions between the diffusing species and the colloidal particle .",
    "these results allow us to compute that _ part _ of the force experienced by the colloidal particle which is solely due to the self - generated non - equilibrium spatial distributions of the reactive species .",
    "( we note that , on the other hand , the same interactions generate a force of the colloid acting on the reactive species which via their interaction with the solvent , encoded _ inter alia _ in the viscosity of the solution , transmit body forces acting on the solvent , inducing hydrodynamic flow and thus in turn a hydrodynamic force on the colloid ( see , c.f .",
    "[ force ] ) . at steady - state , and in the absence of external forces or torques",
    "acting on the colloid or on the fluid , this second _ part _ of the force experienced by the colloidal particle exactly cancels the first one , and therefore the net force on the colloid vanishes . ) this part of the force can be used to calculate either the hydrodynamic flow of the solution ( i.e. , the pumping strength ) induced by the active colloid ( if the colloid is spatially fixed , e.g. , by optical tweezers ) or the velocity of the colloid , if the colloid is free to move .",
    "our analysis is reliable as long as in the steady state the diffusion of the reactants and product molecules  here and in the following referred to also as `` solutes ''  and the hydrodynamics in the system are such that the peclet number ( i.e. , the ratio of the displacement of the solutes due to convection to that due to diffusion ) and the reynolds number ( i.e. , the ratio of the inertial to the viscous contribution to the hydrodynamic flow of the solution ) are small ( see sec . [ model ] ) .",
    "this implies that we disregard any change of the density distributions due to the flow of the solution . in this case , the diffusive and the convective ( i.e. , hydrodynamic ) transport are effectively decoupled .",
    "the dependence of these quantities ( i.e. , the velocity of the colloid , if it is free to move , or the hydrodynamical pumping of the solution generated by an immobilized colloid ) on the size of the colloid emerges naturally from the interplay between the reaction and diffusion constants , generalizing the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore these results for the non - equilibrium spatial distributions of the reactive species  besides being of interest in their own right  can be immediately adopted in order to calculate the steady - state velocity of the self - propelled particle .    as a by - product of our analysis ,",
    "in the case of triangular - well interaction potentials between the reactants and the colloidal particle we obtain several new results for effective reaction constants which , within the framework of the classical smoluchowski theory of chemical kinetics @xcite , describe the reaction rates occurring at particles with inhomogeneous catalytic activity at their surface .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we define our model for a translationally and rotationally immobile , chemically active colloid immersed in an unbounded system with randomly dispersed diffusive reactants .",
    "section [ conc_distr ] is devoted to calculate the stationary density profiles of mutually non - interacting @xmath0 ( reactant ) and @xmath1 ( product ) molecules around the immobile colloid with a reactive patch covering partly its surface . in that section",
    "we also generalize our approach by discussing also the case of a dissociation reaction @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "[ force ] we first calculate that part of the force exerted on the immobile colloid which is due to its molecular interactions with the solvent and the solute molecules ( i.e. , species @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 ) , as well as that due to the hydrodynamic flow of the solution induced by the spatially non - uniform density profiles of the reactant and the products . furthermore , by employing the reciprocal theorem in the presence of distributed body forces on the fluid @xcite , we obtain an explicit expression for the self - propulsion velocity of the colloid if it is free to move .",
    "moreover we also derive an explicit expression for the stall force necessary to immobilize the active colloid which otherwise would move freely . in sec .",
    "[ disc ] these results are discussed further for the particular case of triangular - well interaction potentials in sec .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ concl ] along with our conclusions .",
    "we consider a macroscopically large reaction bath in which a spherical colloidal particle of radius @xmath4 is immersed .",
    "we choose the origin of the coordinate system to be at the center of the colloid ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we consider two situations : either an immobile colloid ( e.g. , held by an optical tweezer or a very thin tethered spring ) , or an unconstrained colloid which at steady state moves with velocity @xmath5 through the solution .",
    "( in the absence of thermal fluctuations , due to the axial symmetry of the system the axis of the colloid does not rotate . ) in the latter case , the coordinate system is attached to ( and thus co - moving with ) the colloid .",
    "the reaction bath consists of solvent molecules @xmath6 , reactant molecules @xmath0 , diffusing with diffusion coefficient @xmath7 , and ( after some time ) product molecules @xmath1 , diffusing with diffusion coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "the reactant molecules @xmath0 ( molecular mass @xmath9 ) , the product molecules @xmath1 ( molecular mass @xmath10 ) , and the solvent molecules ( molecular mass @xmath11 ) are much smaller than the colloid , so that the solution can be approximated as a continuum , apart from density oscillations in the molecular vicinity of the colloid surface . the number densities ( number of molecules per volume ) of @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules are taken to be very small compared with the number density of the solvent ; therefore we assume that there are no @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 interactions .",
    "the interactions between the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) molecules and the solvent are encoded , together with those among the solvent molecules , _",
    "inter alia _ in the viscosity @xmath15 of the solution treated as a continuous medium ; they enter as well , e.g. , via the stokes - einstein relation , into the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the solution is assumed to behave as an incompressible , newtonian fluid .    a spherical cap of the surface of the colloid particle , lying within the angular region @xmath16 centered around d ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , has the following `` catalytic '' properties : as soon as an @xmath0 molecule approaches the surface of the colloid at any point belonging to the catalytic patch ( cp ) , within a minimal distance @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is of the order of the size of the @xmath0 molecule ) , it undergoes with probability @xmath19 an irreversible reaction ( conversion ) into a product molecule @xmath1 : @xmath20 the probability @xmath19 characterizes the elementary reaction act : @xmath21 means that no reaction occurs , while for @xmath22 one has a `` perfect '' reaction , i.e. , @xmath0 turns into @xmath1 upon any encounter with the surface .",
    "we assume that the catalyst is neither consumed by the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) , nor temporarily `` passivated '' by an intermediate product , and thus at any time it can participate actively in an unlimited number of chemical transformations .",
    "the solvent , acting as a heat bath , serves as a source or a sink of heat if the catalytic reaction is endothermic or exothermic , respectively .",
    "the initial state of the system , i.e. , before the immersion of the chemically active colloid ( or before switching on its catalytic activity ) , is that of a well stirred reaction bath : the @xmath0 molecules are uniformly distributed within the reaction bath with mean number density @xmath23 .",
    "( but in the course of time , upon turning on the reaction , a non - uniform concentration profile can emerge . ) initially the @xmath1 molecules are absent in the system .",
    "the bath is in contact with a reservoir of @xmath0 molecules which maintains this density @xmath23 at distances far away from the colloid at all times .",
    "we furthermore assume that the reaction bath is also in contact with a perfect sink of @xmath1 molecules so that @xmath24 far away from the colloid at all times ; together with the reservoir for @xmath0 molecules , this ensures that a steady state can be maintained in the bath if the reaction is active . as mentioned before , the mean number densities of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules",
    "are assumed to be , at all times , much smaller than the mean number density @xmath25 of the solvent molecules ; therefore the latter is assumed to be at all times approximately equal to its initial value @xmath25 before the reaction is turned on .",
    "the colloid is impermeable to any of the molecules ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath6 ) in the mixture .",
    "the solvent molecules interact among themselves and with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules . as noted above",
    ", these interactions are , _ inter alia _ , accounted for by the viscosity @xmath15 of the mixture and by the diffusion constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "they also interact with the colloid via a radially symmetric interaction potential @xmath26 ( per molecule of solvent ) , in addition to the hard core repulsion accounting for the impermeability of the colloid .",
    "due to the spherical symmetry , for a molecule located at @xmath27 this distance from the colloid is given by @xmath28 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) and thus for convenience we introduce the radially symmetric potential @xmath29 .",
    "we account for the hard - core repulsion via @xmath30 .",
    "( note that in the latter condition the molecules are implicitly treated as pointlike particles because of their size being much smaller than @xmath4 . )",
    "as already noted in the introduction , we assume that the solvent is passive with respect to the reaction and that it acts as a macroscopic heat bath , which keeps the temperature constant even in the presence of the reactions .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules interact with the colloid via an interaction potential @xmath31 ( per molecule ) , respectively , in addition to the hard core repulsion which makes the colloid impermeable for the molecules in the mixture .",
    "we introduce the radially symmetric potentials @xmath32 and account for the impenetrability of the colloid via @xmath33 .",
    "thus we disregard the possibility that the catalytic patch introduces an angular dependence on @xmath34 of any of the interaction potentials @xmath35 between the molecules and the colloid , as well as the influence of the eventual size disparity between the three types of molecules on the location of the  hard wall  surface of the colloid ( see also the succinct discussion below ) . for reasons of having simple notations later on ( see , c.f .",
    "[ conc_distr ] ) , we also introduce here the interaction potentials of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules with the colloid relative to the corresponding potential for the solvent molecules weighted by the ratio of the mass of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) molecules to the mass of the solvent molecules : @xmath36 for the case of the reaction in eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) , mass conservation obviously requires @xmath37 .",
    "however , in order to keep the formulation consistent with the more general reaction processes , involving more than one species of product molecules , which are considered later on , we maintain the labels @xmath0 and @xmath1 even for this simple case .",
    "the goal is to determine the spatial distributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules once a steady state has been attained and to study the resulting chemical force @xmath38,\\mu)$ ] exerted on the immobile colloid by the inhomogeneously distributed @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules , the velocity @xmath5 ( as a function of the same parameters ) if the colloid is free to move , and the stall force @xmath39 necessary to immobilize a freely moving colloid . before proceeding with the analysis of the dynamics of the system , it is important to clarify the choice of the position of the hard wall . in general",
    "this is a complicated issue for interfaces involving more than two molecular species .",
    "additionally , the divergences of the interaction potentials ( and of their derivatives ) caused by molecular hard cores in the limit @xmath40 significantly complicate the mathematical arguments given below ( see , c.f .",
    "[ conc_distr ] ) .",
    "this leads us to use the following approach . within a point - particle description of all molecular species ,",
    "the radius @xmath4 of the colloid , and thus the position of the hard wall , is fixed by the most outward layer of molecules composing the colloid .",
    "we assume that each of the molecular pair interactions between a molecule from the colloid and a molecule of species @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is described well by a lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential .",
    "this involves the parameters @xmath43 ( corresponding to the molecular diameter ) and @xmath44 ( corresponding to the characteristic energy , in units of the thermal energy @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath47 the absolute temperature ) , and leads to the  exact `` interaction potentials @xmath48 which ( all of them ) diverge as @xmath49 .",
    "subsequently , the radius @xmath4 , and therefore the position of the hard wall , is redefined as @xmath50 , with @xmath51 of the order of a molecular size .",
    "these truncated potentials are bounded at @xmath52 ( with @xmath4 interpreted as the shifted radius ) , at the expense that @xmath53 now turn into phenomenological , effective parameters , and that the results depend on the choice of @xmath54 .",
    "the arbitrariness can be reduced by further modifying the shape of the potentials @xmath55 , e.g. , by adjusting the point at which their tails are truncated while requiring that the excess adsorption of each component , which is an experimentally measurable quantity , is the same for the shifted and modified potentials and for the exact ones . on one hand",
    "this does not eliminate the dependence on the choice of @xmath54 , on the other hand it provides a prescription based on which , in principle , this dependence can be explored systematically .",
    "while this approach can not be justified rigorously , we note that such a procedure has been employed recently with satisfying results for describing equilibrium properties , such as phase coexistence and interfacial properties , by using triangular - well potentials , ' ' mimicking  ( in the above sense ) lennard - jones interactions @xcite .",
    "we aim at describing the distribution of the molecular components in the mixture within the standard theory of linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . the solution as a whole is assumed to behave as an incompressible newtonian fluid .",
    "the reaction will be accounted for via boundary conditions on the surface of the colloid .",
    "therefore , the description of the dynamics of the mixture will involve ( i ) continuity equations ( conservation of mass ) for the mixture and for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 species ; ( ii ) linear relations between the conjugate thermodynamic fluxes and forces determining the entropy production rate ; ( iii ) the navier - stokes equations obeyed by the barycentric velocity @xmath56 of the mixture ( i.e. , conservation of momentum ) .",
    "the liquids involved in typical experimental studies have a very low compressibility ; therefore they can be assumed to have a constant mass density @xmath57 . in terms of the number densities @xmath58 and the molecular masses , and accounting for the fixed number densities of @xmath0 and @xmath6 molecules far from the colloid , this can be expressed as @xmath59 where the rhs corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "the local number density of the solvent can be determined once @xmath61 and the number densities of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 species are known .",

    "this is the case because the interaction potentials @xmath74 vary spatially and the chemical potentials @xmath75 ( in the absence of interactions ) vary with position due to the fluid mixture being in contact with the source ( sink ) for the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) species at the colloid surface and with the sink ( source ) for the @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) species far away from the colloid surface so that the system is out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
