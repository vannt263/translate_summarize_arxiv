    "periodic motion is truly a classic topic in classical mechanics , with the harmonic oscillator being a typical example .",
    "periodic motions are ubiquitous in nature , and physical systems , such as a pendulum , often also contain anharmonicity at some level . therefore , linear and non - linear oscillations have been studied for a long time@xcite . for systems with many degrees of freedom ,",
    "the harmonic theory is well understood and can be analyzed in terms of normal modes of the theory , by using their linear combinations . however ,",
    "when the system has many continuous degrees of freedom and is anharmonic , there is still some progress to be made in the systematic study of their periodic orbits .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically construct periodic orbits in non - linear lattice models by extending normal modes of the harmonic theory .",
    "the class of models we study are conservative , hamiltonian systems , with quadratic inter - site potentials and general on - site potentials . in these models ,",
    "the origin of the non - linearity is contained in the localized on - site potentials . in particular , we investigate the @xmath0 theory , with periodic , fixed and free boundary conditions , in some detail . the main purpose of this work is to explicitly work out how the various aspects of the non - linear dynamics come together in generalizing the normal modes to these class of models . through the construction of the periodic solutions in the non - linear theories , we clarify which modes in the linear theory can and can not be extended .",
    "we then analyze their stability from a dynamical systems viewpoint . in the process",
    ", we compute the lyapunov spectra along these periodic orbits , and show quantitatively how they are related to the stable and unstable modes that appear , as the energy corresponding to the periodic orbit is changed .",
    "furthermore , a general method of finding extensions of normal modes in lattice theories with quadratic inter - site and general on - site potentials is constructed , and explained with examples .",
    "while the dynamics of the theories we study here are of interest on their own , these theories arise naturally as discretized versions of the continuum field theory , of which @xmath0 theory is a typical case .",
    "@xmath0 theory has been studied from various points of view on the lattice : classically , the transport properties of the theory have been investigated from statistical mechanics viewpoint at finite temperatures@xcite and their relation to dynamical systems aspects of the theory , including the lyapunov spectrum and dimensional loss@xcite , with thermostats .",
    "the on - site potentials of the models we study destroy the shift symmetry properties of the fields ( cf . ) that exist in well studied models such as the fpu model@xcite , leading to qualitatively different dynamical behavior , such as the bulk behavior of transport coefficients@xcite .",
    "the chaotic properties and the lyapunov exponents of the non - thermostatted @xmath0 theory , as well as some of its periodic orbits have also been investigated@xcite . the @xmath0 theory , including quantum effects , has been studied in such topics as triviality@xcite , and non - perturbative aspects of particle physics phenomenology@xcite , since the @xmath0 theory is a part of the standard model .",
    "while the physics of the @xmath0 theory investigated in this work is classical , understanding of the classical theory is also important to the understanding of the quantum theory , and furthermore , classical solutions can be an important contributing factor in quantum theories .",
    "the periodic orbits we study are so - called `` non - linear normal modes '' of the class of non - linear models .",
    "non - linear normal modes have been studied extensively for some time and various general properties have been established@xcite , and investigated in models such as the fpu model@xcite .",
    "most of the explicit work conducted so far seems to focus on theories with non - linear inter - site couplings .",
    "these properties can , for instance , represent non - linearity in the elastic response of materials and can be of practical importance .",
    "accordingly , much applied research has been performed on the subject@xcite .",
    "we believe that our work , which concentrates on models with quadratic inter - site potentials , with non - linear couplings that are local , contributes results complementary to the current research in the dynamics of non - linear systems with many coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "let us review the @xmath0 theory on an one - dimensional lattice with @xmath1 sites , in brief , partly to fix the notation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the theory is @xmath2 where the potential terms at the ends , @xmath3 , depend on the boundary conditions as @xmath4 the non - linearity of the system is provided by the quartic on - site potential , or the tethering potential .",
    "the on - site potential destroys the shift symmetry ( shifting all @xmath5 by a constant ) , which exist in other well studied non - linear models such as the fpu model , leading to a different dynamical behavior for them .",
    "the system has a quartic coupling of essentially one , and is not a weakly coupled theory , in general .",
    "the equations of motion for the theory are accordingly , @xmath6 the boundary conditions may be specified as , @xmath7 we note the fixed boundary condition by itself also breaks the shift symmetry .",
    "the two boundaries may also have different conditions , which shall not be considered here .",
    "in this section , we construct a class of periodic solutions in the @xmath0 theory on the lattice , based on the normal modes of the harmonic theory .",
    "a more general study of periodic solutions using powerful group theoretical methods have been conducted@xcite , and have been applied to models such as the fpu model@xcite . here",
    ", we briefly explain a more elementary approach to the solutions which hopefully provides some different insight , and derive the results needed later .",
    "the class of solutions we study are sometimes called non - linear normal modes or one dimensional bushes@xcite .",
    "suppose that the @xmath1 linearly independent normal modes of the harmonic chain are , @xmath8 these normal modes satisfy the _ linear _ equations of motion , @xmath9 the solutions to these linear equations of motion may be found using the coefficients of the form , @xmath10 , and the harmonic frequencies can be found as , @xmath11 the values of @xmath12 depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall analyze which of these solutions extend to the @xmath0 theory , for _ general _ @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we look for solutions of the non - linear theory , in which all the coordinates undergo the same motion , except possibly the amplitudes of the motion . using the ansatz , @xmath13 the equations of motion reduce to @xmath14 these equations are consistent if and only if the non - trivial equations are independent of @xmath15 .",
    "this is satisfied when the square of non - zero coefficients , @xmath16 , are independent of @xmath15 , @xmath17 in which case , the equations of motion reduce to an ordinary differential equation for a non - linear oscillator , @xmath18 @xmath19 the solutions to these equations are periodic in time . though seemingly simple",
    ", the procedure has reduced the non - linear coupled @xmath20 first order differential equations to just one second order differential equation . while there seem to be a few definitions of the `` non - linear normal modes '' , periodic orbits constructed above are non - linear normal modes in the strict sense@xcite .",
    "the motion of the coordinates are `` similar '' and synchronous  they all undergo identical motion with respect to time , except for their amplitudes . it is important to note that the periodic orbits we have found here exhausts all the synchronous oscillations that can have arbitrary overall amplitudes .",
    "this is because all such modes should still be synchronous when the overall amplitude goes to zero . in this limit , the dynamics become harmonic , and the motions need to reduce to the standard linear normal modes .",
    "obviously , changing the overall amplitude of a motion is equivalent to changing its energy .",
    "the non - linearity of the theory manifests itself in the motions themselves ; the shapes and the periods of the orbits depend on their energy , which is a qualitatively different behavior from the linear theory .    clearly , this kind of construction is valid for any equations of motion , in which the couplings between the sites lead to linear terms in the equations of motion , and the only non - linearities are due to the on - site potential . in particular , this construction works for any boundary condition , since the boundary conditions change only the linear parts of the equations of motion .",
    "another point evident in the above derivation is that this construction can be generalized to a theory with any on - site potential .",
    "we shall investigate the dynamics of on - site potentials other than the @xmath0 theory in .",

    "the periodic orbits explained in the previous section have only two first order degrees of freedom in essence , and might not seem `` chaotic '' . however , they can be unstable from a dynamical systems perspective . in this work",
    ", we investigate the stability , or lack thereof , of the periodic orbits , from this point of view . when the orbit is unstable , perturbations grow exponentially large with time",
    ". therefore , this instability appears as the positive maximal lyapunov exponent along the orbit .",
    "obviously , the instability can also be seen explicitly by following perturbed trajectories .",
    "if the exponent is positive , a small perturbation on the orbit will cause the trajectory to diverge exponentially from the periodic orbit .",
    "while , this tells us how to discriminate when the orbit is unstable , it does _ not _ tell us _",
    "why _ the orbit is unstable or stable . for this",
    ", we now turn to an analysis of the perturbations around the orbit .",
    "general theory of stability analysis has been studied previously and have been performed explicitly for periodic orbits in the fpu model@xcite . partly to avoid confusion",
    ", it should be mentioned that even when the orbits are dynamically unstable , some orbits can be stable from a computational standpoint@xcite .",
    "this is a technically interesting issue , perhaps of practical import , which we briefly explain : any numerical computation contains round - off errors and has only a finite precision .",
    "therefore , one might expect that following unstable orbits numerically for a long time is impossible , since any deviation will force the trajectory to diverge exponentially with time from its `` true '' trajectory .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , some periodic orbits can be followed for an arbitrarily long time .",
    "the reason for this is that their symmetry properties are preserved to the last bit in the data , with the appropriate coding and the use of compilers .",
    "for instance , in the integration of the the symmetric and antisymmetric orbits explained in previous section , the properties @xmath50 are fully preserved in the numerical integration .",
    "while it is unclear if this situation applies to all periodic orbits , it applies also to other orbits we investigate below .",
    "this property allows us to follow periodic trajectories and compute lyapunov spectra averaged along them with precision , given enough computational time . in this work ,",
    "we used the fourth order runge - kutta routine for integration and the method explained in @xcite to compute the lyapunov spectra .",
    "let us briefly summarize the properties of lyapunov exponents , which will be of use to us@xcite .",
    "lyapunov spectra have been computed in various hamiltonian systems@xcite , including the @xmath0 theory both thermostatted and not thermostatted@xcite .",
    "when one follows a trajectory in phase space , the neighboring trajectories can diverge from ( or converge to ) the original trajectory exponentially and their exponents per unit time are called lyapunov exponents .",
    "if we consider all the possible different directions of the neighboring trajectories and average along the original trajectory , their rates of divergence or convergence from it , we obtain the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the systems considered in this work are all hamiltonian systems , with the hamiltonian having no explicit time dependence . for @xmath1 pairs of coordinates and momenta , @xmath51 , there are @xmath20 lyapunov exponents .",
    "the spectrum of exponents is made up of pairs of the form @xmath52 ( @xmath53 : lyapunov exponent ) and is invariant under changing the sign of all the exponents , due to the time reversal symmetry of the system .",
    "furthermore , at least one pair of exponents is zero , since the trajectories are on a @xmath54 dimensional constant energy surface .",
    "it should be noted , that in this work , we follow periodic orbits , which are localized in the phase space , and compute the lyapunov spectra along them .",
    "so the lyapunov spectra obtained here are different from the spectra obtained by averaging over the chaotic `` sea '' in the phase space@xcite .",
    "the simplest case to analyze the stability of the periodic orbits is the @xmath35 system , since the @xmath55 system will only have zero lyapunov exponents , and hence no instability , from the properties referred to above .",
    "below , this system with periodic boundary conditions is analyzed in some detail . for @xmath35 , there are only the `` symmetric '' orbit , in which both coordinates are the same , and the `` antisymmetric '' orbit , in which the coordinates are @xmath56 times each other .",
    "these cases are instructive and enables us to clearly see the mechanism behind the instability of the orbit , or lack thereof , enabling us to extend this understanding to more general cases .",
    "the lyapunov exponents for the periodic orbits has been computed in some cases@xcite .",
    "it was found that the symmetric solutions , , seemed to have zero maximum lyapunov exponent for any energy , though numerical computations can not rule out small non - zero exponents .",
    "in contrast , the antisymmetric orbits , , were found to be stable at low energies , becoming unstable at higher energies .",
    "this stark contrast is intriguing , but its underlying physics was unclear .",
    "we will see how this originates below .",

    "the deviations from the orbit satisfy @xmath69 these equations are those of harmonic oscillators with oscillation frequencies that depend on time .",
    "the frequencies are clearly real for both equations , so that there is no trivial exponential growth .",
    "yet @xmath62 is periodic , so that solutions to these equations can exhibit parametric resonance@xcite , which we now investigate .    while the equations can be analyzed numerically , and shall be done so below , it is worthwhile to study the mechanism analytically .",
    "parametric resonance arises when the frequency of the oscillation changes at a rate close to twice the base frequency , to leading order .",
    "the condition for such an instability for an oscillator satisfying @xmath70 is @xmath71    while the basic motion , @xmath62 is not sinusoidal , let us approximate @xmath62 by @xmath72 to gain insight , where @xmath73 is the energy per oscillator .",

    "the behavior of perturbations around a periodic solution may be obtained by solving the perturbation equations .",
    "intuitively , it should be expected that the growth rate of the perturbations should be consistent with the lyapunov exponents averaged along the periodic solution .",
    "this shall be quantitatively confirmed below .",
    "it should be noted that the computations involved in obtaining the lyapunov spectra and solving the perturbation equations are quite different . to obtain the lyapunov spectrum , in principle , we need to solve the equations of motion and measure how different solutions with close initial conditions diverge . in practice , in the method we adopt , the equations of motion for the whole system are solved while also tracking the evolution of vectors in the tangent space , a procedure that requires @xmath121 coupled first order equations to be solved .",

    "each equation should correspond to two lyapunov exponents .",
    "when the perturbations equation is of type ( a ) in floquet s theorem and @xmath119 is not real , a perturbation can grow exponentially and @xmath122 should coincide with the lyapunov exponent pair @xmath123 . in all other cases ,",
