    "recently , there has been great interest in studying the multi - dimensional burgers turbulence ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the fractal burgers equation ( cf .  @xcite ) and the fractal conservation law equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , etc .",
    "all these works are based on the analytic approaches , especially the energy method , duhamel s formulation and the maximum principle .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a probabilistic treatment for a large class of quasi - linear partial integro - differential equations .",
    "let us first introduce the main idea . by reversing the time variable",
    ", one can write burgers equation ( [ el5 ] ) as the following equivalent backward form : @xmath10 now , consider the case of @xmath9 , and for a given smooth solution @xmath11 to the above equation , let @xmath12 solve the following stochastic differential equation ( abbreviated as sde ) : @xmath13,\\   x_{t , t}(x)=x,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a @xmath15-dimensional standard brownian motion on @xmath16 $ ] . by it s formula and the markov property of the solution",
    ", it is well known that @xmath17 conversely , assume that @xmath18 solves the implicit system ( [ es1 ] ) and ( [ es2 ] ) ; then @xmath19 also solves the backward burgers equation ( [ es3 ] ) .",
    "this type of implicit stochastic differential equation has been systematically studied by freidlin  @xcite , chapter  5 ; see also  @xcite .",
    "let us now substitute ( [ es2 ] ) for ( [ es1 ] ) ; then @xmath20_{y = x_{t , s}(x)}\\,\\dif s+\\sqrt { 2\\nu}\\,\\dif w_s , \\nonumber \\\\[-8pt ] \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{s\\in[t,0],\\   x_{t , t}(x)=x.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the markov property holds , one can write the above equation as a closed form , @xmath21,\\    x_{t , t}(x)=x,\\hspace*{-35pt}\\ ] ] where @xmath22\\}$ ] , and @xmath23 denotes the conditional expectation with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the question is this : suppose that the stochastic equation  ( [ es4 ] ) admits a unique solution family @xmath25 .",
    "does @xmath26 defined by ( [ es2 ] ) solve burgers equation ( [ es3 ] ) ? to answer this question ,",
    "the key point is to establish the following markov property : for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 so that equation ( [ es4 ] ) can be written back to ( [ ee2 ] ) .",
    "this is not obvious since sde ( [ es4 ] ) involves a conditional expectation operator . on the other hand",
    ", one can replace the brownian motion in equation ( [ es4 ] ) by an @xmath0-stable process , as is done in  @xcite , so that we can give a probabilistic explanation for the burgers equation ( [ es3 ] ) .",
    "basing on this simple observation , in this paper we are mainly concerned about the following general stochastic functional differential equation ( abbreviated as sfde ) driven by a lvy process @xmath30 : @xmath31 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext { s\\in[t,0],\\ x_{t , t}(x)=x,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are some lipschitz functionals ( see below ) . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we are devoted to proving the existence and uniqueness of a short time solution as well as the markov property ( [ mar ] ) for equation ( [ sde0 ] ) under lipschitz assumptions on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , a locally maximal solution is also achieved .",
    "since lvy processes usually have poor integrability , we have to carefully treat the big jump part of lvy processes .",
    "compared with the classical argument in freidlin  @xcite , it seems that sfde ( [ sde0 ] ) is easier to handle since it is a closed equation .",
    "next , in section  [ sec3 ] we apply our results to a class of quasi - linear partial integro - differential equations ( abbreviated as pide ) and obtain the existence of short time solutions . here , we discuss two cases : @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy linear growth conditions , but lvy processes have finite moments of arbitrary orders ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are bounded , but equation ( [ sde0 ] ) has a constant coefficient in the big jump part .",
    "this is natural since only the big jump is related to the moment of lvy processes .    in section  [ sec4 ]",
    ", we turn to the investigation of the following system of semi - linear pides ( nonlinear transport equation ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the generator of the lvy process given by ( [ ge ] ) below .",
    "it is observed that the following scalar conservation law equation can be written as the above form : @xmath37 in particular , the one - dimensional fractal burgers equation ( [ es3 ] ) takes the above form . in equation ( [ tr ] ) , since there are not any analytic properties to be imposed on @xmath36 , one can not appeal to the duhamel formula or the energy method to give an analytic treatment .",
    "in this situation , the probabilistic approach seems to be quite suitable .",
    "in fact , by using purely probabilistic argument , we shall prove in theorem  [ main ] below that pide ( [ tr ] ) admits a unique maximal weak solution in the class of bounded lipschitz functions . in the nondegenerate case",
    "( corresponding to the subcritical case for @xmath38 with @xmath2 $ ] ) , the existence of global solutions is also obtained by applying some gradient estimates .",
    "we mention that for the one - dimensional burgers equation ( [ el5 ] ) , it has been proved in  @xcite that the global analytic solution does exist for @xmath39 $ ] , and the finite time blow up solution also exists for @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the critical case of @xmath41 , the existence of global solutions for the general equation ( [ tr ] ) is left open .",
    "we conclude this introduction by introducing the following conventions : the letter @xmath42 with or without subscripts will denote a positive constant , whose value may change in different places . if we write @xmath43 , this means that @xmath44 depends only on these indicated arguments .",
    "let @xmath45 be an @xmath46-valued lvy process on the real line and defined on some complete probability space @xmath47 , which means that :    * @xmath45 has independent and stationary increments , that is , for all @xmath48 , the random variables @xmath49 are independent , and the distribution of @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath51 .",
    "* for @xmath52-almost all @xmath53 , the mapping @xmath54 is right - continuous and has left - limit ( also called cdlg in french ) .",
