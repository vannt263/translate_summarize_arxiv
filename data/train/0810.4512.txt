    "the pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent a subject of considerable interest since some time ( cf .",
    "@xcite for surveys ) .",
    "investigations of various aspects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are tightly related with several theoretical challenges and can augment the experimental information on different phenomenological model parameters .",
    "for instance , the `` anomalously '' large mass of the @xmath1 meson , as member of the @xmath2 nonet @xcite , can be directly connected with the @xmath3 axial anomaly in qcd .",
    "a combined phenomenological analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in @xmath4 reactions together with the @xmath5 anomaly provides additional information on the gluon - nucleon coupling , which can be used to describe , e.g. , the so - called `` spin crisis '' .",
    "also , the knowledge of the nucleon - nucleon-@xmath1 coupling strength allows a better understanding of the origin of the ozi rule violation in @xmath4 reactions .",
    "a remarkable fact is that near the threshold the invariant mass of the @xmath6 system in such reactions is in the region of heavy nucleon resonances , i.e. resonances with isospin @xmath7 can be investigated via these processes .",
    "furthermore , the so - called `` missing resonances '' can be studied .",
    "another aspect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in elementary hadron reactions is that both mesons have significant dalitz decay channels into @xmath8 . as such",
    ", they constitute further sources of di - electrons .",
    "it is , in particular , the @xmath0 which is a significant source of @xmath9 pairs , competing with @xmath10 dalitz decays and bremsstrahlung , as the analysis @xcite of hades data @xcite shows .",
    "one of the primary aims of the hades experiments @xcite is to seek for signals of chiral symmetry restoration in compressed nuclear matter .",
    "for such an endeavor one needs a good control of the background processes , including the @xmath1 dalitz decay , in particular at higher beam energies , as becoming accessible at sis100 within the fair project @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dalitz decays depend on the pseudo - scalar transition form factor , which encodes hadronic information accessible in first - principle qcd calculations or qcd sum rules .",
    "the dalitz decay process of a pseudo - scalar meson @xmath11 can be presented as @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , the probability of emitting a virtual photon is governed by the dynamical electromagnetic structure of the `` dressed '' transition vertex @xmath13 which is encoded in the transition form factors . if the decaying particle were point like , then calculations of mass distributions and decay widths would be straightforwardly given by qed .",
    "deviations of the measured quantities from the qed predictions directly reflect the effects of the form factors and thus the internal hadron structure .",
    "the present paper reports parameterizations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross sections in nucleon - nucleon collisions near the respective thresholds within a one - boson exchange model .",
    "emphasis is put on the accessibility of transition formfactors encoding the strong - interaction @xmath14 structure .",
    "cross sections of interest are @xcite @xmath15 with two - particle invariant phase space @xmath16 for the production of @xmath17 and    @xmath18      we employ here a one - boson exchange model , where the @xmath0 production is described by the diagrams exhibited in fig .",
